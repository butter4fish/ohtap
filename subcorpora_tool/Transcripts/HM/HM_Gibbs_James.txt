Speaker 1: My name is Loretta Henry, I'm doing the interview, and Scott Stearns is doing our camera work.  Could you please tell me your full name: your first name, middle and last name, and spell them for us?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: My name is [HistoryMaker] James Lowell Gibbs, Jr.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the Lowell is, L-O-W-E-L-L.  And the Gibbs is, G-I-B-B-S.  And I guess everybody can spell James.
Speaker 1: I hope so (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Could you tell us where you were--when you were born and where you were born?
Speaker 2: I was born in Syracuse, New York, June 13th, 1931.  And I was a premature baby.
Speaker 1: Oh, how premature were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I had to stay in the hospital for two months before I was up to the weight that my parents [Huldah Hortense Dabney Gibbs and James Lowell Gibbs, Sr.] could take me home.
Speaker 1: How much did you weigh when you were born?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.  It was under five pounds, and my mother had had her appendix burst in the seventh month of pregnancy.  And so, that was why I was born prematurely.
Speaker 1: So was it a cesarean (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not with a cesarean section, with a, with a vaginal birth.  So it was very special.  My mother almost died.
Speaker 1: Yes.  I would think so.
Speaker 2: But she pulled through and--
Speaker 1: You pulled through (laughter).
Speaker 2: --and I pulled through.  And so here we are.
Speaker 1: Here we are.  Oh, that's great.  Could you tell us what today's date is?
Speaker 2: Today is April 4th, 2006 [sic. April 5, 2006].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the location, where are we now, the address?
Speaker 2: The address is 857 Sonoma Terrace, Stanford, California.  We're on the Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California] campus.
Speaker 1: In your home.
Speaker 2: And in our home.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Thank you.  And your occupation, please?
Speaker 2: Yes.   I'm a cultural anthropologist.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My Ph.D. is in social anthropology, social, cultural anthropology are more or less the same.  And I'm now retired.  I am an emeritus professor, and I have a mouthful of a title for my formal title.  I am the Martin Luther King Jr. Centennial Professor of Anthropology Emeritus.  And I'm the first holder of that endowed chair named after Martin Luther King, Jr. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  And I'm very proud to be the holder of that title.
Story_ID: 331922
Speaker 1: We're going to start.  I'm going to ask you just kind of some warm-up questions, so just bear with us because they're kind of People magazine-ish kind of questions.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you're gonna go, what is--what?  Okay.  The first one is:  could you please tell us your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Oh.  That's hard.  Because I'm an anthropologist, I like many different kinds of things.  So I guess my favorite food would be either chicken curry or a Chinese stir-fry or African--what they--in Liberia it's called country chop, palm oil chop.  Any of those three.  They all involve rice. They all involve interesting flavors.  And I guess it's hard for me to choose one because I like to cook.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What's a pop chop?
Speaker 2: Palm chop.  It's, P-A-L-M.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The cooking oil that's used is derived from the palm nut, and it's like olive oil in the sense that it has a very distinctive flavor.  You can't really substitute for it. And it's kind of an acquired taste, and once you've lived in West Africa or in Brazil--they use it in, especially in Bahia [Brazil]--once you've tasted a cuisine that uses palm oil, you tend to be kind of addicted to it.  It's a very special flavor.  And it's kind of reddish in color, so it gives it that distinctive kind of reddish-orange color to it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh.  Okay.  Well, thank you.  Could you tell us--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: Okay.  Could you tell us your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Summer.
Speaker 1: Summer?
Speaker 2: Summer.  I think that's because I grew up in Ithaca, New York, where the winters are cold.  And my first teaching job was in Minnesota, where there was a lot of cold weather.  I went to graduate school [Harvard University] in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  So summer is my favorite time of year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  If you had any choice of some place to spend a vacation, where would it be?  You can go anywhere in the world, where would your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Favorite vacation spots are Bali [Indonesia]; Hawaii; Mexico, especially Puerto Vallarta [Mexico].  Other places I've particularly enjoyed are Shanghai [China], Cape Town [South Africa]--
Speaker 1: All warm places.
Speaker 2: All, all--
Speaker 1: Warm, sunny (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's true.  They are all warm places.  And I guess they're all places near the water, although swimming is not my thing.
Speaker 1: You just like to look at the water?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Just like to see it?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Traveling is kind of a hobby.  And I guess that goes partly with being an anthropologist and enjoying not only different places but the cultures.  Bali, for example, is just an absolutely fascinating culture, and it's been studied by anthropologists for a long time going back to Margaret Mead.  And I used to teach about it in introductory anthropology for years and then finally got to go there.  So those are the kind of places--and also, you notice, they all have interesting foods (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) You have a favorite saying or phrase (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A favorite saying?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I guess the saying that we all got from our grandparents, you know, you have to work twice as hard to get half as far.  That's very, a very prominent saying in the African American community.  And I think that's been a kind of guide for me.
Story_ID: 331923
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So we're going to talk about your family, all right? Okay.
Speaker 1: So we'll start with your parents.  All right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Could you please tell us your mother's name and spell it for us, her full name?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, my mother's maiden name was Huldah Hortense Dabney [Huldah Hortense Dabney Gibbs].  And the last name is spelled, D-A-B-N-E-Y.
Speaker 1: And her first name is spelled?
Speaker 2: Huldah, H-U-L-D-A-H.
Speaker 1: Is that--was that name in her family?  Do you know where she got that?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was.  It was in the family.  Her mother was also named Huldah.  And my sister is named Huldah, and my niece has the name Huldah.  So my grandmother was Huldah Paulina Jackson [Huldah Jackson Dabney].  My mother was Huldah Hortense Dabney, and she used Hortense.  And my sister is Huldah Ann Gibbs Jones [Huldah Gibbs Jones], and my niece is Huldah Beth Ann Jones [ph.].
Speaker 1: Do you know the origin of that name?  Is it African or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  It's not African.  It's Dutch.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: And the family oral history is that my great-great-grandfather was the brother of a white woman of Dutch descent who lived in Richmond [Virginia], Elizabeth Van Lew.  She's a historical figure, who turns out to have been a spy for the Yankees during the Civil War.  And her brother had a child by a woman who was my great-great-grandmother.  So I think the Dutch name Huldah came that way.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Thank you.  Could you tell us where she was born, when she was born?
Speaker 2: My mother?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My mother was born in Richmond, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--on April 5th--tomorrow would be her birthday--in 1907.
Speaker 1: Nineteen o'seven [1907]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did she ever--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: Okay.  So we were talking about your mother, and you were telling us her bir- where she was born and when she was born.  Did she ever tell you about--any stories from when she was a child, when she was growing up?
Speaker 2: She talked a lot about being proud of being a Richmonder.  And she didn't talk a lot--well, yes, she did talk about her childhood with her--she had a sister and a brother, and talked a lot about her mother, who was a schoolteacher, and then my mother herself became a schoolteacher.  She went to normal school [Armstrong Normal School] in Richmond [Virginia].  You know, that's two years of teacher training.  And before she and my father [James Lowell Gibbs, Sr.] got married in 1930, she taught for two or three years just outside of Richmond in a small town.  So she talked a lot about her school teaching and the teachers that she taught with.  There was a lot of focus on education.
Speaker 1: So they were a middle class family she grew up in, in Richmond, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a middle class family.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Could you describe--how would you describe her?
Speaker 2: My mother?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: She was very pretty, very warm, very gracious, very insightful about people, an avid reader, she was very intelligent; and very committed to being involved in the community and social justice.  My mother was a remarkable woman.
Story_ID: 331924
Speaker 1: Are there any other stories you'd like to tell us about her, anything else that you'd like to expand on about her?
Speaker 2: One of my favorite memories (laughter) is, I guess I was--must have been about five or six, and I think my mother [Huldah Hortense Dabney Gibbs] and I were especially close because of the fact that she had had this difficult, difficult birth and had almost died.  And I can remember her taking me to the movies to see Shirley Temple in a movie with Bill "Bojangles" Robinson.  And for some reason that particular going to the movies stays in mind.  And I can remember her teaching me songs.  I'm not a singer, I mean, everybody who knows me will know, you know.  I can sing, but I don't think I got my racial heritage that way.  Teaching me a song, lookie, lookie, lookie, here comes cookie, strutting on down the avenue.  And she also taught me 'When I Grow Too Old to Dream.'  And she taught me to read, so by the time I was in first grade, I was already reading.  She read a lot to me.  And because I was growing up in Ithaca, New York, my family moved from Syracuse [New York], where I was born, about 1935, '36 [1936] to Ithaca where my father [James Lowell Gibbs, Sr.] had a job as director of a community center [Southside Community Center, Ithaca, New York].  So I was--my parents were always concerned, growing up in the North, that I understand that a black community life could be far richer and deeper than it was in Ithaca, New York because there wasn't a large black middle class there.  And so I would go to visit my aunt and uncle and cousins in Richmond [Virginia] in the summer, that was always a big treat because things were very special.  And the other thing that my mother--and one of her friends who was, I guess, what in anthropology we call a courtesy aunt, a person that she taught school with over the years, we called her Aunt Elsie.  She was Elsie Twyne Fisher.  And she would send me books.  And I remember one particular book.  I must have been about seven or eight years old.  And it was a picture book about a little African boy, African American boy, named Toby [ph.].  And it was a book with black and white photographs of Toby on his farm in the South and working with his family and so on.  And it had some text.  And I think my mother and my Aunt Elsie were trying to make sure that I was aware of my African American roots in terms of what I had to read 'cause there wasn't a whole lot at that time.  You know, it was mainly 'Little Black Sambo' ['The Story of Little Black Sambo,' Helen Bannerman].  And this was their counterpoint to 'Little Black Sambo.'
Story_ID: 331925
Speaker 1: Could you tell us about your father?  What was his name--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and where was he born and--?
Speaker 2: My father was James Lowell Gibbs [James Lowell Gibbs, Sr.].  And his father was Alonzo [Alonzo Gibbs (ph.)].  He was called Lonnie [ph.].  And so--and my father was born in Florence, South Carolina, October 22, 1904.  So he was born in Florence.  His father, Alonzo--Lonnie--died when he was about seven.  And my grandmother remarried, and with her new husband moved to Richmond, Virginia.  So although my father was born in Florence, South Carolina, he was basically raised in Richmond, Virginia, and considered himself a Virginian.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did he tell you any stories about his growing up when he was little?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I was going to tell you a story--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --about the--about his name--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --'cause people often ask me about that.  My grandmother was not too fond of her husband's name, Alonzo or Lonnie, but she wanted--and my father was her firstborn child--and she wanted to honor her husband, but not use his name.  So my father was called James, after her brother.  And Lowell was a name that started with L because her husband's name, Lonnie, that she didn't really like, started with L, so he got that name.  I later learned in researching family history--I went to Florence, South Carolina, to do that--that there's a Lowell Street in Florence.  So in searching for a name with the L to honor her husband, I think that's where the name came from.  And so people often ask me, you know, "Were you named after James Russell Lowell, the poet?"  And so I, "No.  It's a little different than that." You know, my father used to tell stories about his teenage years because his stepfather worked as a grinder in a steel mill, and it was important for my father to work.  And he did various kinds of jobs, working in a bakery, and working in a restaurant, and he was--used to teach me little tips that he had learned when he was working, like, I guess, after school weekend jobs; things like--it's funny how you remember these things.  Like when you're washing the pots, don't put the knives--leave the knives in the dish water because you are more likely to be able to cut your finger if your hands are in hot water with the knife.  So you just put the knife in and wash it and take it out.  Those kinds of practical stories, you know, father to son.  So it's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So do you do that now when you're doing your dishes?  Do you take the (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, I do.  I find myself talking to my (laughter), talking to myself in my father's voice.
Story_ID: 331926
Speaker 1: Your father [James Lowell Gibbs, Sr.] had a very interesting career in New York.  Could you tell us about what your father did?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My parents got married in 1930.  It was in--July 19, 1930.  It was in the Depression [Great Depression], so it was a very small, quiet wedding.  My father was--had been raised as a Baptist.  My mother [Huldah Hortense Dabney Gibbs] had been raised as a Methodist.  They got married, I think it was in a Methodist church.  But as a couple they decided they needed to find a new denomination that they both shared.  So they became Episcopalian.  And I teased them about that and said, "Oh, so you were moving up?"  For their honeymoon they were part of the great migration that the Schomburg [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York] traces and the Smithsonian [Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.] traces.  They drove.  My father had a car, which was important in 1930.  And they drove from Richmond [Virginia] to Syracuse [New York] for their honeymoon.  And for a time they lived with my grandparents while they got settled.  And my father had a couple of jobs to support his family.  He was the boys' worker at the community center in the African American community of Syracuse, New York.  It was the Paul Laurence Dunbar Community Center [Syracuse, New York].  And he also had a part-time job as mechanics' helper in a garage.  And that's one of the things I admire about my father; that he, while he had the profession of being a social worker, as circumstances required he was willing and able to do other things to support his family.
Speaker 1: Excuse me.  So they drove on their honeymoon to Syracuse--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and they just stayed?  Is that (unclear) (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  So the honeymoon was going to where they were--
Speaker 1: Oh.  Okay.
Speaker 2: --going to live.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my mother was a housewife because at that time--well, first of all in New York State, you could not teach with a normal school--two years of college; you had to have a full degree.  And there weren't any black teachers in Syracuse at that time, anyway.
Story_ID: 331927
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, over in Ithaca [New York], which is about fifty miles from Syracuse [New York], where Cornell University [Ithaca, New York] is located, a group of black women who worked at Cornell as, basically as domestics; as dormitory maids and sorority maids and cooks, bought a little house in the area of town, which--it wasn't exactly a ghetto, but it was the area of town that had a higher proportion of African American communities--families than any other area.  They bought a little house to have as a community center.  And one of them acted as the director of the community center.  And the WPA, the Works Project Administration [Works Progress Administration; Work Projects Administration] under the federal government, one of the, Roosevelt's [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] agencies, gave the community a grant to build a real community center.  So they built what was the Southside Community Center [Ithaca, New York], which was dedicated--I think it was in 1937.  Eleanor Roosevelt, who was the first lady, came to dedicate the center.  And the women who had bought the little house for the first center hired my father [James Lowell Gibbs, Sr.].  They heard about his work in Syracuse as the boys' director [at the Paul Laurence Dunbar Community Center, Syracuse, New York], and they hired him as the first executive director of Southside Community Center.  And he did a marvelous job as community center director because his vision for a community center was that it was not simply a recreation center, but it was a place to be a center for the community, where all kinds of activities could take place, where all age groups would be served.  There were things like a, a group that studied African American history.
Speaker 2: This is--
Speaker 1: There was a Boy Scout [Boy Scouts of America] troop, a Girl Scout [Girl Scouts of the United States of America] troop (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) back in the '40s [1940s], right?  Early '40s [1940s].
Speaker 1: Excuse me?
Speaker 2: This was like during the early '40s [1940s].
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Starting in 1937 and through the '40s [1940s], during World War II [WWII]. One of the things he did was to--he thought it was very important to--for people in the community to move out of the traditional occupations that they had; out of service work into other kinds of things, and there was resistance.  In the high school, often black kids would be shunted into the commercial track, rather than the academic track.  And yet, when they wanted to get jobs--say you were in the business track and you wanted to be a secretary and you wanted to get a job, the businesses would say, "Do you have any experience?"  And, of course, they didn't hire people, so they didn't have any experience, so you had a catch-22.  So what my father did was to set up what we would now call internships for kids after school.  People who were taking the secretarial and business courses would come to the community center, and he would give them real work to do, secretarial work for the center, so that they could have some experience.  And one of the things that's really interesting to know is that one of those young women who was an intern for him in the--around 1940--it must have been around 19--maybe '54 [1954], '56 [1956], somewhere along in there--a professor in the Cornell history department decided he was going to hire the first black secretary at Cornell.  Could you imagine, it's in the 1950s that Cornell hires its first black secretary?  And she was a young woman who had had that training with my father.  And she got hired, and eventually she became the head secretary in the history department.  So that's kind of typical of my father.  The other thing I would say about him to show his vision for the community: in the community center there was a lobby.  And hanging up there was a--for what reason I don't know--there was a wagon wheel that was a chandelier, and the walls were kind of knotty pine.  And hanging from this chandelier was a poster that my father had made.  It was black oilcloth with white letters cut out and pasted against the black.  And it said--in letters about this high (gesture), so it was very prominent when you walked into the community center, to know your race is to love your race.  And that was characteristic of, of his vision.  So when you asked me earlier, is there a favorite saying--that could have been one, too.
Story_ID: 331928
Speaker 1: He worked for an airlines later on, and he helped to hire the first black stewardess.  Is that true?
Speaker 2: Yes.  That's right.  After several years as director of the community center [Southside Community Center, Ithaca, New York], it was--he was so thoroughly committed that he was beginning to get, I guess, with hindsight, I could say a little bit burned out because he would, in a sense, bring some of the issues--community issues--home.  And so it was time for him to do something that was less stressful.  He was very successful at it, but it was beginning to take its toll.  So he shifted first to the [U.S.] Postal Service.  So, it was a sort of nine-to-five job that you could leave as a postal clerk inside.  When you came home, you could leave it all there.  And he was clerk in charge of airmail and associated with Ithaca's [Ithaca, New York] first airline.  It started as Robinson Airlines [Robinson Aviation], and it became Mohawk Airlines, then Allegheny Airlines, and then USAir [US Airways].  And my father [James Lowell Gibbs, Sr.] was a very good people-person.  He was very good at brokering, bringing people together.  He had an enormous impact on the community beyond the community center itself, and, again, looking out for younger people, trying to promote (unclear) along, and so on.  Little Mohawk Airlines needed stewardesses--and they were little DC-3s [Douglas DC-3]--and he persuaded them to hire a young woman named Carol Taylor [Ruth Carol Taylor] as a stewardess.  And she was the first African American stewardess on any airline in the whole country.
Speaker 1: You are--he's so--you should be so proud of your father and what he did.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: It's just amazing.
Speaker 2: Well, she's no longer a stewardess, of course, but she is back east (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) A first, right.
Speaker 2: --and very much an activist in community affairs.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's wonderful.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 331929
Speaker 1: We're just gonna go back and tie up a few loose ends; one, about your father's [James Lowell Gibbs, Sr.] education.  So could you explain a little bit (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  My mother [Huldah Hortense Dabney Gibbs] and father met in high school, in Armstrong High School in Richmond, Virginia.  And my mother was, I think, the class of '23 [1923], and my father, class of '25 [1925].  Even though he was a little bit older, he got started in elementary school later in South Carolina than she had.  And I think she skipped a grade, too.  So they met in high school.  As I told you, my mother had the normal school [Armstrong Normal School] education in Richmond.  My father, when they got to Syracuse [New York], did some courses at Syracuse University [Syracuse, New York].  He was the first one in his family to graduate from high school.  So he was considered the family intellectual.  And then he went on to do some courses at Syracuse University.  But again, it was the Depression [Great Depression].  And he also did social work institutes and so on.  But he didn't actually graduate from Syracuse, but, you know, he got enough to be a social worker.
Story_ID: 331930
Speaker 1: And we were also talking about the fact that the local paper recently did a series of articles about your parents [Huldah Hortense Dabney Gibbs and James Lowell Gibbs, Sr.].
Speaker 2: Yes, they did.  The local paper is the Ithaca Journal, and they have on the weekends a series called, Then and Now.  And last month they did a series of three articles looking back to the years when my parents were at the community center [Southside Community Center, Ithaca, New York] because my mother helped my father in the activities at the center.  And so they were tracing the impact that my parents had on the community, not just through the community center, but through their involvement in all kinds of organizations.  My father, for example, was the first black member of the Rotary Club [Rotary Club of Ithaca, Ithaca, New York].  He became very active in the rotary.  He was very active with the human relations commission [Tompkins County Human Rights Commission, Ithaca, New York].  They were both active with the, St. John's Episcopal Church [Ithaca, New York], the Republican Party, and sort of on and on and on.  And my father because he was such a good-people person, and mother, too, they both sort of brought people together.  And over a period of time made Ithaca [New York] a more aware place about race matters and more welcoming place, so that my father, in one of the articles, was referred to as the informal mayor of Ithaca because he did have such an impact in the various organizations that he belonged to and mother, that she belonged to.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So they set a good example (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They certainly did.
Speaker 2: --for, for me and my sister [Huldah Gibbs Jones].
Story_ID: 331931
Speaker 1: We had talked a little bit about your ancestors, and you've done some family history?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Could you just tell a short summary of your family history as far--how far back can you trace your heritage?
Speaker 2: For my mother [Huldah Hortense Dabney Gibbs] it goes back--I can go back about five generations in Richmond [Virginia], and I haven't been able to get beyond that but may ultimately be able to.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So about what year is that, about?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess we're going--we're talking about mid-19th century, maybe.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's about as far as I've gotten.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And on my father's [James Lowell Gibbs, Sr.] side, I've gotten back to 1834, my great-grandfather.  There was a family myth that my father's father [Alonzo Gibbs (ph.)]--remember, he died when my father was seven, so my father didn't know very much about him.  In fact, he doesn't even have a picture of him. And the family mythology was that he had been born in the West Indies.  That's over years I was trying to find, well where was he born in the West Indies?  But with some help from a colleague, we got back to census records and discovered that he was, indeed--my great-grandfather was born in South Carolina.  And my grandfather was one of eleven children, all born in that county in Florence, South Carolina.  So, on my father's side we can go back to about 1834 in terms of South Carolina roots.  And we may be able to go further.  Recently, my wife [HistoryMaker Jewelle Taylor Gibbs] and I were in Florence.  They have a wonderful new county library [Drs. Bruce and Lee Foundation Library, Florence, South Carolina], a spectacular library with a special room for--
Speaker 1: Genealogy.
Speaker 2: --genealogy and South Carolina history.  And the librarians there were very helpful.  It's quite a remarkable experience.  We also were, worked in the public library [Richland Library] in Columbia, South Carolina. In the New South, the involvement, engagement of librarians, black and white, to help African Americans to trace their history.
Speaker 1: That's a wonderful story.
Speaker 2: Well, one of these days, I hope to get it back to Africa.  But we'll see.
Speaker 1: That'll, that'll (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We'll have to try that new DNA route.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That, that should be interesting.
Story_ID: 331932
Speaker 1: Can you please tell me, what's your earliest memory of growing up (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I guess the earliest memory--I think the earliest--well, a very early memory, even before going to that Shirley Temple movie, was my parents [Huldah Hortense Dabney Gibbs and James Lowell Gibbs, Sr.] were renting, but this time they had--I must have been about three or four--my parents were no longer living with my grandparents.  My father had gotten established to the point that they could rent their own place, and it was a flat in a community in Syracuse [New York].  And behind--there were some garages behind the house, and there was a stable; there was a horse-drawn, I think, milk cart.  And the milk cart guy would bring the horse and put him in the stable in the late afternoon, after he'd done his rounds.  And so my earliest memory is of watching the horse being put into the stable, and maybe being a little bit attracted and, yet, at the same time, a little bit scared of the horse.  And then the next one was the memory I told you about of my mother take me to the, taking me to the movies and teaching me those little songs.

Speaker 1: What was your family life like when you were--when the whole family was together?
Speaker 2: Oh, we were very family-centered.  We always had dinner.  We just took it for granted that we would have dinner at home until my--my sister [Huldah Gibbs Jones] was born in 1940, so she's eight--I was eight and a half when she was born.  So I had that period as an only child.  And then when she was about twelve, I went off to graduate school [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  Then she had her period as an only child.  And until my sister was, maybe in high school, my mother [Huldah Hortense Dabney Gibbs] never worked; she was a homemaker.  So she was there to prepare dinner and so on.  My father [James Lowell Gibbs, Sr.] did not cook.  So my mother did all the cooking, and she made dinner.  We talked at dinner.  It was about what we had done during the day.  There was a lot of talk about what went on at the community center [Southside Community Center, Ithaca, New York], what went on in the community.  I think one of the reasons why I became a social scientist was because there was so much talk at home about what was happening in the community; why it was happening, how it worked.  So fairly early on, I thought I wanted to be a social scientist.  I wasn't sure I wanted to be a social worker because I'd seen my father as a social worker, and I thought, that's maybe too hard; maybe I'll do some kind of social science.  We always looked forward to vacations and particularly to going to Richmond [Virginia] to visit family.  My father loved to drive, and so those trips were exciting.  And there were always a lot of talk about what was going on in the African American community.  As I go through this stream of consciousness, I think about all kinds of things.  As a kid, I had a paper route.  I carried the--this was before I was carrying the daily papers, I had a paper route with the Pittsburgh Courier [New Pittsburgh Courier] and the Afro-American.  So I had a little wagon, and there were two communities in Ithaca [New York] where you had a substantial number of black families.  There was the south side, where the community center was, and then there was also the north side.  And I think I had maybe about thirty to forty families.  It was not a whole lot.  But this was before Ebony and Jet, you may remember.  So we got our news through these weekly newspapers.  And the Pittsburgh Courier especially, that was our window on the broader national community.  And so we would talk at dinner about what we were reading in the Pittsburgh Courier.  And I was always a good reader, so that was an important source of information.  So the family did a lot of that kind of talking, and about--no, what should be done to make Ithaca a better place.

Speaker 1: You had mentioned your sister.  Could you tell us her name and tell us something about your sister?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  My sister is Huldah Ann Jones [Huldah Gibbs Jones].  She grew up in Ithaca [New York], went to Ithaca High School [Ithaca, New York], went to junior college in Boston [Massachusetts], and then took training as an orthoptician.  So that's a kind of medical technology where you deal with children who have problems with vision where they're a little cross-eyed; and you get--first of all you do a diagnosis and then you do a series of exercises with them.  So her career was as an orthoptician until she got married.  Her career was basically--most of her career was part-time.  She's now retired from that, and she's a freelance writer.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: Okay.  Before your wife [HistoryMaker Jewelle Taylor Gibbs] left, you were telling us about your sister, and she's just retired, I think.  She's retired?
Speaker 1: Yes.  She's retired and she does volunteer work--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and she's a freelance writer.
Speaker 2: Does she still live in New York?
Speaker 1: She lives in Cherry Hill, New Jersey.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Thank you.
Speaker 1: And she has two adult children.
Story_ID: 331935
Speaker 1: Are there any sights or sounds or smells that when you come in contact with them they immediately takes you back to your childhood?
Speaker 2: That's an interesting question.  I guess it's not a sight you see often anymore, but chestnut trees and chestnuts.  And Ithaca [New York] was sometimes called the forest city, so there were lots of stately elms that would meet over the tops of the streets, including our street.  So you don't see elm trees very much anymore either because of the Dutch elm disease.  But that kind of sight makes me think of Ithaca and, of course, Ithaca is known for gorges.  There are two gorges that trisect the town.  So any place where I see a gorge and waterfalls make me think of Ithaca and childhood.  Plenty associations you--going back to the stories my parents [Huldah Hortense Dabney Gibbs and James Lowell Gibbs, Sr.] used to tell.  They used to tell about their courtship, and there was some particular soda fountain, I don't remember the name of it, but I remember it was on Leigh Street in Richmond [Virginia], and having ice cream sodas.  And when I had a real paper route, the daily paper route when I was around twelve--between maybe fourteen and sixteen, something like that, that would be a favorite thing to do: stop after your paper route and have a vanilla ice cream soda.  So that's another, another association; a food one, of course.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Story_ID: 331936
Speaker 1: Can you describe your community that you grew up in?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It's a--at the time, Ithaca [New York] was about twenty thousand.  It's a college town.  Geographically, you have Cayuga Lake, which everybody knows about from Cornell's [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York] alma mater, (singing), "Far above Cayuga's waters," on the north side; and then you have hills on the east, south and west.  Cornell sits on East Hill [Ithaca, New York].  And then you have the lake in the north, east, west, south hills, and then the flats.  So where we lived, it was in the flats.  Most of the Cornell faculty--a college town, being a college professor was the best thing you could be, and I guess that's one reason why I wound up being a professor.  I was a grown man before I realized that not everybody in the world thinks that being a college professor is the best thing you could be.  But in Ithaca it certainly was.  So on East Hill you have Cornell, and it kind of dominates the--overlooks the town.  At the time I was growing up, another college, Ithaca College [Ithaca, New York], a smaller college, was downtown.  In the year since then, they have a new campus up on South Hill [Ithaca, New York].  And so they can look across at Cornell University.  And that rivalry, I think some of us like to say, those of us who are Cornellians, that Ithaca College can finally look down on Cornell.  So that's kind of the geographical nature of the town.  And there are those two gorges--that flow--they're on the east and they go through the campus, through the Cornell, through the Cornell campus and then through downtown.  It's in what's called the Finger Lakes region of Upstate New York.  It's really quite beautiful, you know, the lakes and the gorges.  And it was a very nice town to grow up in.  Besides Cornell, at the time I was growing up, there was some industry.  There were something called Ithaca Gun Works [Ithaca, New York], or Ithaca Gun Shop.  Ithaca guns were well known to hunters.  Our family never owned a gun.  Nobody hunted.  So it wasn't connected with our family, but it was something Ithaca was known for.  There was something called Morse Chain Company [Ithaca, New York], which later became part of Allen-Wales [Allen-Wales Adding Machine Corporation, Ithaca, New York].  There wasn't much industry.  It was mainly, mainly Cornell.
Story_ID: 331937
Speaker 1: What was your, your neighborhood like?
Speaker 2: The neighborhood was a working class, lower middle class neighborhood.  Out of the twenty thousand people in Ithaca [New York], about a thousand were black.  And as I indicated to you, most of them worked for Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York] or Ithaca College [Ithaca, New York].  There wasn't much of a middle class.  My father [James Lowell Gibbs, Sr.] came as a social worker.  He brought, not too long after, a friend of his, a doctor, Dr. G. Alex Galvin [G. Alexander Galvin].  They had known each other in Richmond [Virginia], and my father persuaded Dr. Galvin to come to Ithaca and set up his practice as the first doctor, first African American doctor.  There was a dentist who came two or three days a week from Syracuse [New York].  There was an A.M.E. Zion [African Methodist Episcopal Zion church] minister; a Baptist minister who was a part-time minister whose job, I think, was as a custodian.  So the professional community was my father, the doctor, the commuting dentist and the two ministers.  And that was about it. So the community has changed drastically since then.  At that time, there wasn't even a black school teacher.  The first black school teacher was hired after I graduated from Cornell in 1952.  So it would have been somewhere in the late '50s [1950s], I guess.  So that's kind of the nature of the community.  So that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you guys--did you play on the street with your friends after school, or did you go to each other's houses?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  The community center [Southside Community Center, Ithaca, New York] was a, a--important locus for activities.  So a lot of people would come to the center afterwards.  There was a gym, a gym that (laughter) could also be used as an auditorium.  And it was named after Cornell's famous black football player, Brud Holland [Jerome H. Holland]; and my father in his imaginative way, called it the Brud Holland gymnatorium [ph.] because it could be a gym with basketball, but when it was needed for a meeting of some sort, there were some balcony with folding chairs.  And one of my jobs, to help my father when he was having a big meeting, was to bring all those folding chairs down and set them up.  I was a little bit of an oddball in the community, so I was never really good at sports.  So a lot of kids were very good at basketball.  There was a lot of street basketball and baseball and playing kick the can; I was pretty good at that.  I was commenting to my wife [HistoryMaker Jewelle Taylor Gibbs] just the other day how things are very different now than they were when we were growing up because we would walk from our homes to school.  It was about, maybe, three at most four blocks from--in initial years, we lived in an apartment in the top of the community center.  And then about 1944 or so, my parents bought a house two blocks down the street.  But--and elementary school [Henry St. John School, Ithaca, New York], we would walk to school by ourselves.  There was no concern that somebody was going to snatch you off the streets.  So that was a, that was a big difference.
Story_ID: 331938
Speaker 1: You grew up during the time of the Second World War [World War II, WWII].  Did the war affect your community?
Speaker 2: Yes.  There was a big war effort.  I guess a couple of things I can tell you, one, we were trying to help with the business of saving materials but we, I guess we call it now recycling--so I would go around town [Ithaca, New York] with my little wagon and collect newspapers and take them to the junkyard; collect metal; metal was very much desired, so that was one thing that we did during the war.  I can remember a war bond effort.  There was a contest for slogans to help sell war bonds, and I came in third in the contest with a jingle called, hi-ho, hi-ho--I think it was, hi-ho, hi-ho.  Buy war bonds.  We're off to Tokyo [Japan].  Something (laughter), something like that.  So I got my little third prize and my picture in the paper as a little kid for that involvement (laughter) with the war effort.  And, of course, people from the community went into the [U.S. military] service.  So my father's [James Lowell Gibbs, Sr.] brother, his only brother, younger brother, my uncle Chevis [Chevis Gibbs (ph.)], went into the [U.S.] Army, and he died in 19--I think, 1942.  He was at Fort Devens [Massachusetts] and died of appendicitis, which was devastating for my grandmother.  And she was so upset that within six months after he died, she died--and she was--of a stroke.  And she was, I think, fifty-four.  So there was that.  And that was a double tragedy because my father had twin sisters, and one of the twin sisters had died of appendicitis when she was sixteen in high school.  So my poor grandmother lost two of her children to appendicitis; and of course, she almost lost a daughter-in-law, my mother [Huldah Hortense Dabney Gibbs] to appendicitis.  And, you know, at this age, you sort of look back on your life and you see patterns, and you can see just in our family the pattern of differences in healthcare and problems of health in the African American community.  My uncle, you know, he was told, "There's nothing wrong with you; you're just malingering."  You know, "Go back to work."  And perhaps if he were not African American, his aching stomach would have been taken more seriously and he would still be alive today.  But that's a bit of a digression, but that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, but it's, that's good to know.
Speaker 2: --part of the war.
Story_ID: 331939
Speaker 1: Was the church very important in your family life?  Did you, did you attend church often, was it, or was it not important to your family?
Speaker 2: It was important.  My father [James Lowell Gibbs, Sr.] because of his position in the community, the African American A.M.E. Zion church [African Methodist Episcopal Zion church] was a half a block down the street from the community center [Southside Community Center, Ithaca, New York].  Now remember my parents were Episcopalian.  The Episcopal church was a predominantly white church, and there were only a couple of African American families.  So my parents attended regularly, St. John's Episcopal Church [Ithaca, New York], and they would attend fairy often the two black churches.  St. James A.M.E. Zion Church, which was one of the earliest churches in Ithaca [New York]; and Calvary Baptist Church [Ithaca, New York].  And my father thought it was important for the family standing in the community that I should go to Sunday school, not only at St. John's Episcopal Church, which was in the morning, but at A.M.E. Zion church, which was in the afternoon.  So I went to two Sunday schools for quite a few years.  And then when I was about twelve, a friend of the family invited me for Brotherhood Sunday to go to--this was a white friend--to go to church, Sunday school with him at the Presbyterian church [First Presbyterian Church, Ithaca, New York], which I did.  And I liked it better than the Episcopal church.  It was less formal.  And so I told my parents I wanted to go to Sunday school at the Presbyterian church.  And they said, "Okay.  As long as you go to Sunday school it doesn't matter, you can go to the Presbyterian church."  So that was how I became a Presbyterian.
Story_ID: 331940
Speaker 1: Now, we're going to start talking about your schooling.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, you first went to elementary school?  Is that--or--right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  I went to kindergarten in Syracuse [New York] at the Washington Irving School.  That's an early memory.  I can remember the kindergarten room because I can remember a bay window with, at the top, some stained glass.  Don't ask me why I remember that (laughter), but I remember that.  That was kindergarten.  And then we moved to Ithaca [New York], and I started school, in the neighborhood school in the south side, the Henry St. John School [Ithaca, New York], which is now no longer a school, and it's condominiums.  I started in first grade, and I remember there were two first grades, and I think one was more advanced than the other.  And, of course, automatically they put me, as a black kid, in the less advanced one.  And after about two weeks, they called my parents [Huldah Hortense Dabney Gibbs and James Lowell Gibbs, Sr.] and said, "We're going to move Jimmy [HistoryMaker James Lowell Gibbs, Jr.] to the more advanced group because he's already reading and we think he belongs in the more advanced group."  So that was interesting.  And then at the end of that year, I can remember when I got my report card and went home--remember now, you walked home, and my parents weren't home; they came home a little bit later--and I yelled down to my mother, "Guess what?  Guess what?  I skipped a grade."  And she said, "What do you mean you skipped a grade?"  And I said, "Look.  Look.  Here's my report card."  And they had skipped me from the first grade to the third grade.  So I never had second grade, which is why I said I've never been a whiz at math (laughter) because I missed (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) All those (unclear) (laughter)--
Speaker 2: --whatever it is you do in the second grade.  I was always very good at reading at reading and comprehension, so that was the problem.  But, anyway, so for the rest of schooling, I was always a year younger than most of my classmates.
Story_ID: 331941
Speaker 1: Then I went on to Boynton Junior High School [Frank David Boynton Junior High School, Ithaca, New York].  One of the things--you were asking about Ithaca [New York] as a community--one of the things that characterized the community apart from the geographical layout was that, at that time, there were maybe about six elementary schools, but one junior high school and one high school; so that everybody came together for middle school and high school.  So all the kids from the hill [East Hill, Ithaca, New York], the professors' children and the successful businessmen's children and the kids from the flats from working class families, everybody mingled.  And that was--I think that was an important part of our education.  Even though you didn't have all your classes together, in music class--called chorus in junior high school--and in gym glass everybody mingled.  In the academic classes, they were kind of stratified in terms of people's ability.  So you didn't always--you would see certain people in your academic classes and then everybody in those other classes.  Then I went from there to Ithaca High School [Ithaca, New York].  As I was saying earlier, I was always interested in social studies, and I had some teachers who encouraged me along the way.  I can remember a particular teacher during junior high school.  This was during World War II [WWII].  And we had some special social studies material that was based on helping us to understand the world and the war, and we were learning things about maps and the nature of the Mercator projection as opposed to other ways of showing the world.  We had courses in--a class that taught us how to understand propaganda.  I can remember concepts like glittering generalities.  And it's funny how what sticks with you.  And there was one teacher named Jane Stoutenberg, who taught social studies, who was--I think she took a particular shine to me because I was interested in social studies.  And so she was very encouraging.  And so I remember her especially.  And in high school I had an English teacher, Marian Elliot [Marian E. Elliott].  Her friends called her Betty [ph.], who again was very, very encouraging and supportive.  And those teachers--there were other teachers along the way.  I think--if you were a black kid and you were a good student, there were teachers who would encourage you.  Mind you, there were no black teachers.  Not every teacher was strongly encouraging, but there were some.  And--
Speaker 2: About what portion of the student body were the blacks?  About what percentage?
Speaker 1: There was a very low percentage, even in the neighborhood school [Henry St. John School, Ithaca, New York].  We were looking at my sixth grade graduation picture the other day, and in the class of the two six grades together were maybe forty students; there might have been six blacks, in the neighborhood that had a lot of blacks.  In our high school graduating class, let's see.  I want to see that there were 330.  I'm not sure about the number, but about 10 percent blacks.  Not a, not a high number.
Story_ID: 331942
Speaker 1: Did you take part in extracurricular activities?  Were you into sports or music or acting (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I was very active in extracurricular activities; not so much in sports.  I did intramural volleyball.  That was about (laughter)--that was about my speed.  I did not do any varsity sports.  I did band and orchestra; I was a drummer.  I had had piano lessons when I was six or seven and hated them.  And the teacher was, was not a very good teacher in the sense that she was very stern, and so I soon dropped that.  But then later my parents [Huldah Hortense Dabney Gibbs and James Lowell Gibbs, Sr.] said, "You've got to play an instrument.  You can choose."  So I said, "Okay.  I'll do drums," (laughter).
Speaker 1: Got your revenge (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's right.  It was revenge (laughter).  And so, Ithaca [New York] had an interesting thing.  Ithaca College [Ithaca, New York], among other things, specialized in training music teachers and drama teachers.  They trained something like 90 percent of the music teachers in New York State.  So as part of their teacher training, they had an arrangement with Ithaca public schools where you could get music lessons once a week--and this was in junior high school [Frank David Boynton Junior High School, Ithaca, New York]--once a week for ten dollars.  I think it was ten dollars a semester.  So basically, in effect, you had not quite private lessons, but there may be three of you in a class.  So the person who taught me drumming was actually a piano, organ student.  But she knew enough drumming to teach us drumming.  So I played in band and orchestra and assembly orchestra.  I was in the Spanish club and the boys debating society, which was called Congress [Ithaca High School Congress].  I was junior class president and president of the student body when I was a senior [at Ithaca High School, Ithaca, New York].  I went to Empire Boys' State between junior and senior year.
Speaker 1: And what's that (unclear)--?
Speaker 2: I think that's--I may have forgotten one or two things.  Oh, yes.  I wrote for the student newspaper [The Tattler].  I had a column called Jottings from Jim [ph.].  I was on the annual staff, the yearbook staff.  I think that's about it.  I may have forgotten one or two things.
Story_ID: 331943
Speaker 1: Were you a serious student?  Did you get into trouble?  Did you do practical jokes?  What kind of a student were you (laughter) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) I was a serious student.  I was a good student.  I was on the honor roll very frequently.  I graduated in the upper 10 percent of my class.  As I say, I liked social studies.  I liked school.  That sometimes was a bit of a problem because some of the kids in the African American community were not--didn't really enjoy school.  It wasn't the same kind of experience for them, partly because they were not encouraged as much by the teachers.  Some of them enjoyed school more for the sports than for some of the other activities.  So most of the activities that were sort of organized around academics, the students were primarily white.  And you would sometimes get a little bit of a hard time in the African American community for being a serious student.  It would come to a head when there was--the Black Elks [Improved Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks] had a drum and bugle corps, and I played in the high school [Ithaca High School, Ithaca, New York] band and in the drum and bugle corps.  But when you had a parade in town, you had to choose; either you played with the high school band or you played with the drum and bugle corps.  And my father [James Lowell Gibbs, Sr.] and mother [Huldah Hortense Dabney Gibbs] in their Solomon-like wisdom said, "Well, what you should do is alternate," which makes perfectly good sense.  And that was fine with the high school, but it wasn't always fine with some of the, my peers in the, in the Elks' drum and bugle corps.  But, anyway, I did the best I could.
Story_ID: 331944
Speaker 1: What did you gu- your friends, you and your friends do?  You were teenagers, did you have cars?  Did you go to the soda shop?  Did you go to movies?  What did your fr- what did you do with your friends in high school [Ithaca High School, Ithaca, New York]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  One of the big things in my life was high school fellowship at the Presbyterian church [First Presbyterian Church, Ithaca, New York].  It met Sunday evenings for supper and a worship service and a program.  And I really enjoyed that.  And it turns out, looking back at it, with hindsight of what I've learned since then, it basically--many of the people who went to high school fellowship at Presbyterian church were the people who were the leaders in the high school activities.  So it was kind of an elitist group.  And--but that was a kind of an official sort of activity.  When people had private parties, sometimes you got invited and sometimes you didn't.  So there was acceptance on the one hand, but lines got drawn on the other hand.  I dated in high school, and there were occasional parties.  There wasn't a whole lot of social life in Ithaca [New York].
Story_ID: 331945
Speaker 1: When you were in high school [Ithaca High School, Ithaca, New York], what were your dreams?  What did you think you were going to do with your life?
Speaker 2: Well, that's a good question.  When I was in junior high school [Frank David Boynton Junior High School, Ithaca, New York], I thought I wanted to be a commercial artist.  And we were encouraged to read books about what we wanted to be, and I read these books about commercial art.  And I came home to my parents [Huldah Hortense Dabney Gibbs and James Lowell Gibbs, Sr.] and said, "I think I want to be a commercial artist, and I want to illustrate children's books."  And I said, "I want to be--here's a person that I read about who's a commercial artist, and he does these wonderful drawings."  His name was Elton Fax.  So I come home and I show my parents this book illustrated by Elton Fax, who was a pretty well-known children's book illustrator, and he was black.  And my parents said, "Oh, we know Elton Fax.  He was at Syracuse [Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York] with your father.  He was a student in art."  And more than that, my parents had a charcoal drawing that Elton Fax had done of my mother.  And it had been there all the time, I never--they never talked about it, and I never paid any attention to who (laughter) the drawing was by.  And so they said, "Yes.  You could be like Elton Fax, if that's what you want to be."  Then I got to high school and I took a couple of art classes, and no matter how hard I tried, I could never (laughter) do more than a B.  So I decided, well, art really wasn't my calling.  If I (unclear) to be an artist, I certainly ought to be getting A's in art.  Then in sophomore year, in tenth grade, there's a required course called world history in New York State.  And in the world history course, here was another teacher who was really very outstanding.  She was a young woman who was just out of teacher training college.  And we'd studied at the early part of the course about early man, caveman and all that.  And anthropology was mentioned, and, "Oh, that's interesting."  And I kind of filed that away, didn't do too much about it.  Then in senior year in high school, in English class you have to write a long paper about some subject, so--at least in the track that I was in.  So I decided I would write about anthropology, and I told this favorite teacher I told you about, Ms. Elliott [Marian E. Elliott], that I wanted to do my paper on anthropology. She said, "Well, that's good."  And I started, you know, reading stuff in the encyclopedia, you know, how you do it in high school.  And she said, "I think I can help you out.  I have a friend who's an instructor in anthropology at Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York], and I can arrange for you to have an interview with him."  So I did all this background work, and then I had this interview with Milton Barnett [Milton L. Barnett], who was, at that time, an instructor, but a Ph.D. in anthropology.  And so he talked to me about anthropology.  And I can remember him saying to me, "You know, anthropologists have to live in the communities in which they work in." And, "Do you think you might have to eat sheep's eyeballs if you were working in the Middle East?  Do you think you could do that?"  And I thought, woo.  At that point, I did not eat soft eggs.  I did not eat poached eggs or, you know, sunny side up eggs.  And I decided--I had a part-time job at the student union building in food service at Cornell, and I decided, well, if I'm going to be an anthropologist, I'd better start practicing.  So I started.  Since, you know, so many people like sunny side up eggs, maybe they're not so bad.  So (laughter) I began to practice.  And I wrote that paper on anthropology.
Story_ID: 331946
Speaker 1: Another sort of tie-in to that was in my junior year in high school [Ithaca High School, Ithaca, New York]--at a certain age when you got to be sixteen, you could no longer have a paper route.  And you had to have a regular job.  And that was a tricky point.  That was one of the places where discrimination in Ithaca [New York] came to bear.  It turned out that the high school placement service would call an employer.  You'd see a job and you'd apply, they would call the employer and say, "Will you take a colored boy?"  And evidently most of them said, "No."  But there was one firm that said, "Yes."  This was an upholstery firm that was run by a Jewish couple.  The husband was American-born, the woman was Russian-born, and he was her second husband.  Her first husband had established the business.  And they were very liberal, and they said, "What do you mean even asking that question?  Of course we'll take a colored boy."  And so I was hired as an upholsterer's assistant, and I worked after school.  And I would do things like removing the covers from the old furniture so you could put the new cover on.  And eventually I learned how to install springs and tie down springs and so on.  Anyway, I'm getting away from the point of the story was--at that Christmas, I think I was sixteen, they gave me a Christmas gift that was by Paul Robeson's wife.  Her name was Eslanda Goode Robeson, and she was an anthropologist.  She did her Ph.D. at the London School of Economics [London School of Economics and Political Science, London, England], I think, in mid-career.  So she was a middle-aged woman when she did her field work for her dissertation in Uganda, and their only child, Paul, Jr. [Paul Robeson, Jr.], was about nine years old.  And she took Paul with her as she did her field work in Uganda.  And then she wrote this book.  It was a popular book called, 'African Journey' [Eslanda Goode Robeson].  And it was the story of--her story of what it was like to go to Mother Africa and discover her African roots.  And my employers gave me this book.  And I was just absolutely absorbed by that book.  And that was leading up to the decision to write that paper about anthropology.  So I give Mrs. Robeson a lot of credit for being an impetus of steering me toward, toward anthropology.

Speaker 1: So you grad- you graduate from high school [Ithaca High School, Ithaca, New York].
Speaker 2: Yes.  I graduate from high school.
Speaker 1: And you make a decision, and you go on to college.  Right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I went to--surprise of surprises--I went to Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York].
Speaker 1: I wonder why (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) In the hometown.  And as my mother [Huldah Hortense Dabney Gibbs] used to say, I went to Cornell and I slept at home (laughter).  I spent a lot of, a lot of time on the campus.  I enjoyed college.  I loved Cornell.  About twenty-five students from my high school class went on to Cornell.  So when I go to Cornell class reunions, I also have a kind of mini-reunion with other Ithacans who went on to Cornell.
Speaker 1: Were there any other black students that went with you to Cornell?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: From your high school?
Speaker 2: Yes.  One.  Juanita Johnson.  It was Juanita Miller she was.  Her married name was Juanita Miller Johnson.  And the two of us were the most academically oriented of the black students.  You know, we were considered kind of hopeless klutzes (laughter), just good for nothing but, but brain work.  And she had a very outstanding career.  She went on to do a master's [degree] of mathematics, and then she was a statistician with Mobil Oil Company [Socony Mobil Oil Company, Inc.; ExxonMobil] for years.  She's now retired, of course, now.  So, the two of us were buddies-in-arms when it came to being together and being good students and moving on.
Story_ID: 331948
Speaker 1: So what kind of classes did you take at Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York]?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I was in the College of Arts and Sciences, so you have a liberal arts major where you have to take work in certain areas.  You got to do some science, some art and so on.  I started with the understanding that I knew I wanted to do something in social science, so I started my freshman year, I was going to be a historian or an anthropologist.  After my freshman history course, it was like the art course, and I didn't do badly, but I did much better in the introductory, sociology and anthropology than I did in introductory history; although, history had been a favorite subject of mine in high school [Ithaca High School, Ithaca, New York].  So I began to veer toward anthropology and sociology.  I decided I would not be a sociologist because all the blacks that I knew or knew about in sociology worked in race relations.  And I thought living as a black person in America is hard enough, that I didn't want to make that my career.  And so I veered toward anthropology.  Now, it's ironical that by choosing Africa, I ultimately was going to do a lot that dealt with race relations one way or another anyway, but I didn't see that at the beginning.  So I was leaning in that direction.  A couple of things consolidated it for me.  At the end of my freshman year--now, remember, I'm a year younger than everybody else--so the end of my freshman year was 1949, and I was going to be eighteen about a week after school ended.  Professor Robin Williams [Robin M. Williams, Jr.], who was a sociologist at Cornell--the department at that time was a combined department, the Department of Sociology and Anthropology [Department of Anthropology].  They had a big research project focusing on intergroup relations that was called the Hometown Project [ph.].  We can now say that it was a study in Elmira, New York, about thirty miles away from Ithaca [New York], of the relationship between WASPs, White Anglo-Saxon Protestants, and hyphenated Americans: Italian-Americans, Jewish-Americans, what was then called Negro-Americans.  And they wanted an interviewer and participant observer to work in the African American community, and they wanted a mature black woman.  They looked around the department and the closest thing--they couldn't find a mature black woman.  Professor Williams, I think, took a chance and hired a just-turned-eighteen-year-old black boy to be the interviewer and participant observer.  So, some of the other people who worked on the project were graduate students.  But I was the only undergraduate that first year to work on the project.  And I moved to Elmira and lived in a boarding house with a widow, a black widow, who took in roomers; and did interviews all week long, like you're doing now; and would go to church and participate in the community; and write up field notes.  I mean, that was heady stuff for me to do real field work when you're just--
Speaker 1: Turned eighteen (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) hadn't started your sophomore year.  So then when I went back to school, of course, I had special knowledge to bring to the courses I took, like a course in field techniques.  It wasn't just words to me.  I could bring examples and so on.  So it kind of took off from there.
Story_ID: 331949
Speaker 1: I did that for two summers, doing the interviews; and then the next two summers, I coded my own interviews and ran the tables.  This is before computers.  So taking the interviews and coding them was something that had to be done by hand, then the IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] core cards had to be run through this sorter.  I mean, what I did one summer could have been done in fifteen or twenty minutes with a computer.  But, so I had four summers of working for the department [Department of Sociology and Anthropology, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York], first as interviewer, participant observer; and then as kind of a clerk and clerical worker.
Speaker 2: What were the results of the study [Hometown Project (ph.)]?
Speaker 1: The results, that's a good question.  It's hard to encapsulate it.  It was that people by in large were segregated in their non-work lives; that people would interact to some extent at work; but apart from that, there wasn't very much interaction.  One of my favorite responses was a woman who was asked--there were a lot of social distance questions, you know, would you do this, would you do that.  One of them was, how would you feel if a black person moved into your neighborhood?  And one of--one white responded, said, "Oh, I'd be very proud to have Ralph Bunche as my next door neighbor," (laughter). And that was quite characteristic.  Elmira [New York], even more than Ithaca [New York], had segregated communities.  But the important thing about the project was the fact that it involved me and real research and gave me a handle in which to approach my class subjects.
Story_ID: 331950
Speaker 1: One of the important things within that study [Hometown Project (ph.)]--that experience was that there was a graduate student who was working on the project who was much more senior.  He was a Ph.D. student.  His name was Bob Johnson, Robert Johnson.  And he was kind of a mentor for me.  Now, he was the son of Charles S. Johnson, who had been the president of Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee], who was a sociologist.  So he came from--that's the middle class family--but an upper middle class family, an academic family--his experience was so much wider than my experiences, a little boy from Ithaca [New York] because he had the experience, the family experience of the academic community, the experience of a predominantly black college, of knowing the profession of sociology from the inside.  And so he kind of took me under his wing, and he would read my interviews and my notes at the end, then he pointed out to me, the way you describe this, you're showing a middle class bias.  You've got to be more sensitive to what you are seeing and how you describe that.  I, I really looked up to him.  I mean, he taught me a lot over those two summers.  And that was--so the first time to have--because there were no black faculty (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --at Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York]--to have somebody who--and he did teach, as a teaching fellow, he taught an introductory course in sociology.  So to have that experience, for the first time I had a role model.  I had known other black academics who would come to Cornell for summer school, and my parents [Huldah Hortense Dabney Gibbs and James Lowell Gibbs, Sr.] would befriend them, and they would come to dinner.  But that was different than having somebody who was right there showing you the ropes and mentoring you.  And that was my first experience of knowing how important a mentor could be.  Although I must say that Robin Williams [Robin M. Williams, Jr.] was also a mentor.
Story_ID: 331951
Speaker 1: You were discussing your mentors, and one of your mentors was Mr. Williams [Robin M. Williams, Jr.].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And one of the things, again, that I can, in retrospect, say about him, he was well known for his work in intergroup relations very early on.  And he was from the South.  And so I think it was especially commendable that he hired me [to work on the Hometown Project (ph.)].  He was really taking a chance.  Somebody who's completely inexperienced, very young and giving them so much responsibility.  And he and the other two professors who were heading up the team, Edward Suchman [Edward A. Suchman] and John Dean [John P. Dean], would give me feedback on my work.  And they were very, very encouraging, and ultimately encouraged me to go on to graduate school and so on.
Story_ID: 331952
Speaker 1: So you did go on to graduate school.  You went to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]; is that right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Could I tell you an- one more thing about Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sure.  Of course.
Speaker 2: --before we move on?
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: Okay.  An important part of my Cornell experience was belonging to a group called Watermargin.
Speaker 1: Oh, sorry, okay.
Speaker 2: This was established in my freshman year.  I guess it had started the year before.  A group of veterans, World War II [WWII] veterans, who were students under the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944], wanted to live together in a fraternity, and they wanted this to be an interracial, interreligious group.  And its background, you have to understand that Cornell was a very strong fraternity campus.  There were fifty-two fraternities, thirteen sororities; there were discriminatory clauses, you know, blacks were not taken.  There were, I think if I remember correctly, four or five Jewish fraternities.  There was even one fraternity that was for men of Italian Catholic background, it got that specific.  So this group of veterans wanted (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No black ones, though.  Right?  No black fraternities or sororities.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Although at the time it wasn't active.  Alpha Phi Alpha [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity] was established at Cornell in 1906.  So Cornell does have a tradition of having a black fraternity, and they recently celebrated their centennial.  But they weren't active at that point on campus.  And the group of veterans went to the university and said, "We would like a house where we could live together in a fraternity that's interracial."
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you were telling us about the creation of the Waterman [sic.] house.  You talked about the fraternities.  And so they'd been told that they need to get $10,000 to start.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so this group of veterans was pretty well connected in New York City [New York, New York], and they knew people like Eleanor Roosevelt and Herbert Lehman [Herbert H. Lehman], who was a senator from New York.  And in fairly short order, they came back with the $10,000, and they went to the university and they said, "Here's the $10,000.  Where is the house?"  So the university had no option but to give them the house, which was very nicely placed on campus amidst another group of fraternities.  Now Watermargin did not see itself as a fraternity per se, but fraternity-like, and we wanted to show the fraternities with their discriminatory patterns a different way that people could live together and so on.
Story_ID: 331953
Speaker 1: But the other thing that was characteristic of Watermargin is that, apart from the usual fraternity activities like Saturday night parties and house parties, there was an educational program where we were trying to educate the campus about civil rights, human rights, race relations.  And we invited prominent speakers to the largest auditorium on campus, some people like Eleanor Roosevelt, Margaret Mead; we had conferences, (unclear) musicians; we had field trips to New York [New York] to visit settlement houses and communities.  It was a full educational experience.  And for me it was, and I think for many of the people in Watermargin, it was a very important part of our life at Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York].  Some of my best friends were people that I met at the beginning of Watermargin; my friend Peter Tonachel, who was from New York; my friend Harley Frank who is no longer living, from New York.  Harley was also a major in sociology and anthropology.  His father was a professor at Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York].  So, like Bob Johnson [Robert Johnson], he knew the academic world from the inside and would--was not intimidated by our professors because he sort of knew what they were like as human beings.  So I learned from him how to understand what was going on in class and to be able to relate to professors; although I had picked up some of that simply from being a part of Elmira [New York] project [Hometown Project (ph.)] that I told you about.  So Watermargin was very, very important in shaping my view of being open to engagement with people of different groups and open to coalitions with people from other groups to try to make a better world.
Speaker 2: Do you know how they got their name, Watermargin?
Speaker 1: It came from a legend about a group of rebels in ancient China who wanted to create a better society, and they met where the water met the mountain.  So Watermargin.  I think in Chinese it's Shui Hu Zhuan.  And the translation was, all men are brothers.  And we had a pin, which, unlike the fraternity pins which had Greek letters, our pin had Chinese letters.
Speaker 2: Oh, that's wonderful.  Is the group still active?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yes.  The group still continues.  It now is co-educational, and it includes women.  It's a co-op.  And interestingly, for a while they had kind of moved away from the educational program, but now they're back to stressing the civil rights, human rights, and the education.
Story_ID: 331954
Speaker 1: I think it's interesting that your father [James Lowell Gibbs, Sr.] met Eleanor Roosevelt, and you also met Eleanor Roosevelt through this organization.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Want to tell us a little bit about that, about meeting her (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  That's true.  Well, when she came to speak for us, I happened to be on the door at the, at the Watermargin house [at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York], so I was the one to greet her and welcome her to Watermargin.  And I think the fact that she dedicated Southside Community Center [Ithaca, New York] in 1937, came to Watermargin, it must have been 1950, was still engaged with human rights.  In fact, at that time, she was on the--writing the--I think the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: --UN [United Nations] human rights declaration [Universal Declaration of Human Rights], that her engagement was so long and so intense, was an example for all of us.
Story_ID: 331955
Speaker 1: You were in the student NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]; is that correct?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And through that you found out where you were going to--what your next step in life was going to be.  Right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's true.  There was a national conference in Boston [Massachusetts] in the summer of, I think, 1950; maybe '51 [1951].  And I went as a delegate representing the Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York] NAACP and met Walter Carrington [HistoryMaker Walter C. Carrington], who was black from Everett, Massachusetts, and a member of the class of '52 [1952] at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]; and I was class of '52 [1952] at Cornell.  And he took me over to Harvard and showed me around, and I decided this is where I want to go to graduate school.  I was very impressed with Harvard.  And I wouldn't have admitted this over the years, but now I can.  The only application I completed for graduate school was for Harvard, and fortunately I got in.
Speaker 1: You put all your eggs in one basket, huh?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: So how was Harvard?  How was your stay there?  Did you enjoy your classes?  How did you find it?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Harvard was a good experience academically.  It wasn't such a great experience socially.  Although, Harvard, had proportionally a few more black students than Cornell.  I guess I didn't mention that Cornell, my graduating class, I was student body president--I'm sorry--senior class president at Cornell.  Our graduating class had about 1300 students.  And out of those 1300 students, there were six or seven who were African American.  So we were one-half of one percent.
Speaker 1: That's not very much.
Speaker 2: At Harvard, they had a few more.  They might have been like one percent.  But there were very few among the undergraduates--there were very few among the graduate students.
Story_ID: 331956
Speaker 1: So while Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] was a good place to be academically because, you know, in many ways it's the best.  In terms of social life, it was hard.  I mean, you really had to work to make connections with not only students at Harvard, but the students at BU [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts] and other local schools.  I mean we did it but it took an effort.  As far as I can tell--well, let me say something about the program at Harvard.  Harvard had a Department of Anthropology of long standing.  And they also had a new interdisciplinary department that was established after World War II [WWII] that offered graduate degrees in four fields: sociology, social psychology, clinical psychology, and social anthropology.  And it existed for quite a few years, and now it has disappeared.  So as a student, as a Ph.D. student in social anthropology, I took courses in the Department of Social Relations, that interdisciplinary department.  My degree is in social anthropology from that department.  But I also took courses in the Department of Anthropology.  So you had sort of traditional anthropology, including physical and--physical anthropology, linguistics, archeology and sociocultural anthropology.  So that was the focus of what I did at Harvard.  I liked being at Harvard because it gave me my first chance to teach as a teaching fellow.  And I was what's called a section man, where you assist the professor by leading discussion sections with students once a week.  Ultimately, I became a tutor in one of the Harvard houses. Now, Harvard is known for its stress on residential education and having small classes called tutorials in the undergraduate residences that are called houses.  And I was a tutor at Adams House, and I was the first African American resident tutor at Harvard.  This was in 1954 or '55 [1955].  And I think the reason why I got to be a tutor, two of us from the department were sent over, recommended from the department to the house master, and he could choose between us.
Story_ID: 331957
Speaker 1: My second year at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], a fellowship fell out of the sky, a Rotary Foundation Fellowship [Rotary Foundation Fellowship for Advanced Study], which enabled me to go to the University of Cambridge [Cambridge, England] in England for a year, which, of course, I took.  And that turned out to be very important because the University of Cambridge was much, much stronger in African studies than Harvard.  So I got, among other things, strong training in African studies; stronger than I would have had at Harvard.  I also got to live in the college where I was.  Cambridge has a series of colleges, and I was at Emmanuel College [Cambridge, England] and got to live in college.  So I got to see the Cambridge residential model.  Sometimes we called it the Oxbridge models--Cambridge and Oxford [University of Oxford, Oxford, England] are well known for residential education.  So I got to see them firsthand.  Now, that later turned out to be a stronger benefit than I thought it was going to be because when I came back to Harvard, I'm set for this interview, and how is the housemaster [of Adams House] going to choose between the two of us.  On the one hand from Harvard's eyes, they see themselves at the pinnacle of the Ivy League.  A Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York] degree is not the highest degree, you know.  It has to be Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey], Harvard, Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut].  But I had this year at the University of Cambridge, and besides, I was African American.  And I think for the housemaster, the idea of having a resident tutor who was African American who had spent a year at the University of Cambridge was irresistible.  So I got the job.
Story_ID: 331958
Speaker 1: It turned out later that that year in Cambridge [England] was important in another way.  If we fast forward to years later when I was the first dean of undergraduate studies at Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California], part of what we were trying to do was to strengthen undergraduate education by strengthening the residential education component.  And the fact that I had had the firsthand experience as a resident tutor at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and the firsthand experience of being a student at Cambridge [University of Cambridge, Cambridge, England], I think, gave me insight into what residential education could be and gave me a certain amount of clout as knowing what I was talking about, why I was proposing that.
Speaker 2: Could you just expand a little bit on what you mean by residential education?
Speaker 1: You know, it's where you have some of the instruction take place in the residence, so that students are not only taking a class together, but they're living together.  And the idea is that you will talk about some of the issues from class at the--in the dining hall, so that you don't have a sharp demarcation between the classroom life and the life in the dorm, that you see life as a seamless whole; that the life of the intellect of the classroom and the life of the dormitory can be comingled and that they reinforce each other.  And so, one of the reasons for having resident tutors is that you have (background noise) an older person who is reinforcing this for the students--
Story_ID: 331959
Speaker 1: You've come back from Cambridge [University of Cambridge, Cambridge, England].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you're back at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And you're finishing up your work, I'm assuming.  Right?   Yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I would say--one more thing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You came--okay.
Speaker 2: --about Cambridge.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was the first time I had been out of the country except to go to Canada.  And I had never been west of Buffalo [New York].  I had been south as far as Virginia.  So my experience was basically an East Coast experience, a little bit of Ontario [Canada].  And now I go to England.  It's a wonderful experience because as a Rotary Foundation fellow, not only do you have the year to be a graduate student and pursue your course of study, but you also--the expectation is that you will talk to Rotary [Rotary International] clubs about the way of life in your country.  And you remember this is in the early 1950s.  So it was good because it gave you, besides the academic experience of the university, it got you out into the middle class community.  So you experienced England in a different way.  And they were fascinated by an African American because there weren't very many African Americans at Cambridge (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear).
Speaker 2: But the other thing that was important was, in the spring vacation--in the Cambridge system, you have three eight-week terms, and you have five-week vacations.  And the spring vacation, another American Rotary fellow and I took a five-week trip around the continent.  So the trip over was by ship.  This was before jets were so common.  So I had an eight-day trip on a Holland America [Holland America Line]--basically, it's kind of like a student liner, to get to England; and then in the spring, five weeks on the continent, (unclear) France, Italy, Germany, Yugoslavia, Belgium; just a marvelous eye-opening (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Just a wonderful time.  Yes.
Speaker 2: --experience, and for an anthropologist, of course, just wonderful to see all these other cultures.  And I think that's one place where my interest in cooking grew, experiencing for the first time all these different cuisines on their home turf.  So that was an--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --important part of Cambridge.
Story_ID: 331960
Speaker 1: So then you did come back to--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --back to the United States?  Okay.  Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes, yes.  'Cause the year at Cambridge [University of Cambridge, Cambridge, England] was my second year of graduate work.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.
Speaker 2: And I came back to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] for two more years and continued to be a teaching fellow, not a resident tutor at this--well, let's see if I got the sequence right.  When I came back from Cambridge that was the year I became a resident tutor [at Adams House].  And then in--took my orals in 1956, and left for--got married (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's right.
Speaker 2: --in I think '56 [1956].
Speaker 1: Something very important.
Speaker 2: That's a very big part.
Speaker 1: Very.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: And your wife's name is?
Speaker 2: My wife is Jewelle [HistoryMaker Jewelle Taylor Gibbs].  Her maiden name was Jewelle Althea Taylor.
Speaker 1: And how did you meet her?
Speaker 2: We met at Harvard.  She was in the same department [Department of Social Relations], an undergraduate; and I was a graduate student.  And we would say hello to each other.  She was the only black woman at Radcliffe [Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Massachusetts] who would speak to you if you hadn't been formally introduced.  And she was the only black woman in her class at Radcliffe.  So I arranged what, for her, was a blind date, but for me it was not a blind date, so we could formally meet.  And we met in the fall of her senior year.  And at that time, she was going steady with someone else, but that eventually ended and we got to go out more frequently, and the rest is history.
Speaker 1: The rest is history.
Story_ID: 331961
Speaker 1: You had mentioned some names of some of your teachers.  Was there anybody else who was influential with you at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my mentors at Harvard were Clyde Kluckhohn.  He was very well-known for his work among the Navajo, wrote a popular book called 'Mirror for Man' ['Mirror for Man: The Relation of the Anthropology to Modern Life,' Clyde Kluckhohn].  Now the idea is anthropology is a mirror for man in which he can see himself in his infinite variety.  He was a very strong influence.  Cora Du Bois, who was, I think, the first woman in anthropology at Harvard.  She held the Stone Zemurray [Doris Zemurray Stone-Radcliffe] chair, which was a chair at Radcliffe [Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Massachusetts] for a woman, and she came to Harvard from the [U.S.] Department of State where she had been working.  She's was a specialist in Indonesia and in culture and personality.  And I was her head teaching assistant the first time she taught introductory anthropology at Harvard.  There were four of us, but because I had been a teaching assistant once semester all ready, I was the senior one, and I was her head teaching assistant.  She was an amazing mentor and a pioneer in her own right and very sensitive.  She was a lesbian.  She was very sensitive to minority issues and concerns.  A brilliant teacher.  Her vocabulary was just fantastic.  And she was a mentor.  I remember her saying to me at one point, "Jim [HistoryMaker James Lowell Gibbs, Jr.], one of the things you need to do is to develop a better sense of tolerance for ambiguity," which was a very keen insight and the kind of thing you want a mentor to do, and which I, in turn, tried to do to my students; not just simply instruct them in the content of anthropology, but to sort of see them as whole people and guide them where I thought they needed guidance.  So those two people in particular were mentors. To some extent, Evon Vogt [Evon Z. Vogt], David Schneider [David M. Schneider].  I came into anthropology at a time when the number of African American anthropologists were growing.  There were just a handful when I came in.  And I did not--I guess the first African American anthropologist I met was Manet Fowler [Manet Helen Fowler] at Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York] when she was a postdoctoral person.  And then I didn't meet--actually meet anybody until St. Clair Drake when I was being interviewed for a fellowship to do dissertation field work, and he was a member of the committee.  And so I got to meet a real--second real, living, African American anthropologist.  So our numbers have grown a lot since then.  I'm just in the second generation.  People like Drake, Montague Cobb were the first generation of black anthropologists.  And then we are the second generation.  As far as I know, I'm the first African American to have a degree in anthropology from Harvard.  So it's--I'm a pioneer in that sense.
Story_ID: 331962
Speaker 1: Could you just say something very, very short about Mr. Drake [St. Clair Drake]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Drake, ultimately, became my colleague here at Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California].  One of the best things I ever did for Stanford was when the rumor went around that Drake might be considering leaving his long-time post at Roosevelt University [Chicago, Illinois], we were planning for a department of African and Afro-American studies.  We already had African studies, which had been at Stanford since the '20s [1920s].  And we had--speaking of the programs, that what we want is somebody like a St. Clair Drake to be our first director.  And when I heard this rumor, my wife [HistoryMaker Jewelle Taylor Gibbs] and I invited the Drakes to dinner and said, "Is it true that you might be willing to leave?"  And he said, "Yes."  And Stanford moved for once very quickly.  Within two weeks the appointment was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, wonderful.
Speaker 2: --was made, he was appointed.  He was a marvelous example of what an anthropologist should be because he had done fieldwork in the American South; in the Caribbean; in Africa, he had covered Africa and the diaspora.  He was a really serious, intense scholar; and, again, became a kind of mentor.  Although by the time he came, I was well established in anthropology, but you could always use mentoring from someone whose experience is so intensive.

Speaker 1: You've graduated from college [graduate school, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and you make a giant change.  I mean, you've always talked about, you'd been in the United States, and except for going to Cambridge [University of Cambridge, Cambridge, England]; but then after you got out of school, you go really far away.  You and your wife [HistoryMaker Jewelle Taylor Gibbs] went to--where did you go? To--
Speaker 2: Liberia.
Speaker 1: --Liberia.  Thank you (laughter).  Could you tell us something about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I had always thought I would do my--as a result of the time in Cambridge, England, I consolidated the idea that I would be an Africanist, and Africa would be my special field.  That had started when we had a visiting professor from England my junior year at Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York], a woman named Margaret Reed [ph.], who was an Africanist.  And so that, planted on top of the seed from Mrs. Robeson [Eslanda Goode Robeson], sort of pushed me to Africa.  And I'd always been interested in Africa because of--obviously because of my own roots.  So I thought I would do my fieldwork in Ghana on kinship.  And one summer I was home and ran into one of my Cornell professors, a man named Milton Konvitz [Milton R. Konvitz], who had a Ph.D. in philosophy and a degree in law, and he had been commissioned by the Liberian government to do a codification of Liberian statutory law.  So he was producing these volumes of the statutory law that had been produced in Liberia.  And I ran into him on the street.  He had been my professor and he also was a friend of my parents' [Huldah Hortense Dabney Gibbs and James Lowell Gibbs, Sr.].  And he asked me what I was doing, what my plans were.  And I told him, and he said, "Well, you really shouldn't consider going to Ghana.  You really would be needed to work in Liberia and look at Liberian law.  We know a lot about Liberian statutory law, but we don't know much about Liberian tribal law."  So I looked into it and sure enough, very little had been done on Liberian tribal law.  So I decided, now that would be something I would do.  So I began to read up on traditional law, what at the time we called primitive law.  We don't use that term anymore.  And I realized that very little had been done in Liberia.  And the largest group, ethnic group, in Liberia, there are about thirteen of them, the indigenous groups that were colonized by the freed American slaves, and the largest group is a group called Kpelle--it's spelled K-P-E-L-L-E, and since they are the largest of the indigenous groups, it would make sense to study them because by definition they would be the most typical.  And a little work had been done by a German anthropologist named Diedrich Westermann back around 1915, 1916.  Not very much had been published in English, and by then, the work was quite old. So I decided that's what I would do and applied for a Ford Foundation [New York, New York] Foreign Area Training grant [Foreign Area Training Fellowships] and got the grant.  And so we went off to Liberia.
Story_ID: 332628
Speaker 1: Now, it's quite a contrast to the situation that you find now where Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California] students, in the year 2006, undergraduates who want to do some research in Africa can get a summer research grant and go off to Africa and do some research and experience it.  And here I go off to Africa with my bride to do my doctoral research, never having been to Africa.  And, you know, suppose I didn't like it.  And supposed they didn't like me.  It was, in a way looking back on it, but that was the way it was done in those days because money was tight, and so that's the way it was.  So we had an interesting trip to Liberia.  Again, we went by ship.  I'm a student, I have a lot of time.  We took a ship to England.  Jewelle [HistoryMaker Jewelle Taylor Gibbs] had never been to Europe.  And I said, "Let's stop in England.  I want you to see where I spent time in Cambridge [England] and London [England]," which I loved, "and Paris [France]."  And so we took about three weeks.  We spent time in Cambridge, London and Paris.  And we took a freighter from the South of France to Liberia, a Swiss freighter, if you can imagine, with an Italian crew.  Home base was Genoa [Italy].  The freighter carries by law only twelve passengers because if you have thirteen passengers, you have to have a ship's doctor.  So we had twenty-three days from the South of France to Liberia.  So we did stops along the Mediterranean with the ship loading and unloading cargo.  So we were in Sete, France; Tarragona, Spain; Casablanca [Morocco]; Algiers [Algeria]; the Canaries [Canary Islands]; the Cape Verdes; Dakar [Senegal], which was our first taste of black Africa, and, oh, what an experience that was.  You got off the ship for half a day and the cars and these tall, handsome people and these striking clothes and so on.  And then Conakry, Guinea; and then the last stop was Monrovia, Liberia.  So just getting to Liberia was a memorable experience for us.
Story_ID: 332629
Speaker 1: My research focused on traditional law.  We were, we stayed with a Liberian family that I knew through Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York] connections for about ten days while we got established upcountry with the aid of the government; worked through the Bureau of Mores, Folkways and Customary Laws [sic. Bureau of Folkways, Mores and Customary Laws] to find a location in Panta Chiefdom [Bong County, Liberia], among the Kpelle, where we stayed for a year and a half.  My original grant [Ford Foundation Foreign Area Training Fellowships] was for a year, and it got extended for another six months.  Jewelle [HistoryMaker Jewelle Taylor Gibbs] assisted me with the fieldwork.  She did interviews with women on topics that a man could not interview them about.  I spent a lot of time in court hearing cases, analyzing cases.  It became very clear that the major legal kind of case that they had was cases involving what we would call rights and women: divorce cases, adultery cases.  The Kpelle would say--well, they gave me a name, my Kpelle name is Ya-paulo [ph.].  They would say, "Ya-paulo, when it comes to law, we have only one kind of case here.  It's woman palaver."  That was the--in Liberian colloquial English, the term for cases involving disputes about women.  So my thesis focused on this problem, why is it that most of the cases are woman palaver.  So the title of my doctoral dissertation was 'Some Judicial Implications of Marital Instability Among the Kpelle of Liberia' [sic. 'Some Judicial Implications of Marital Instability Among the Kpelle,' James Lowell Gibbs] because one of the things I discovered and documented was a high degree of marital instability.  So a contribution of my work was to show that one of the reasons for marital instability is that women's labor is so highly valued.  And the economy was based on more on the work of women than on the work of men; that, you know, this is a society where a man can have plural wives, what we call a polygynous society.  And because of that, women's labor being so highly valued, a woman does not have to put up with a man who is not treating her well because there will always be another man who would very much like to have her labor in his household.  And so that's one of the reasons for marital instability.  So, one focus of my work was to demonstrate that.  And one of my doctoral students, Caroline Bledsoe [Caroline H. Bledsoe], has done a book ['Women and Marriage in Kpelle Society,' Caroline H. Bledsoe], in which she took that theme and carried it further.
Story_ID: 332630
Speaker 1: A second product of my work that grew out of the dissertation ['Some Judicial Implications of Marital Instability Among the Kpelle,' James Lowell Gibbs] was a paper ['The Kpelle Moot: A Therapeutic Model for the Informal Settlement of Disputes,' James L. Gibbs, Jr.] on an informal dispute settlement procedure called a moot.  And that is, before you get to court with a case of potential divorce, you'll try to settle it informally in, kind of, in-house among the family, and you get a family member who also is a chief of some sort, and you have an informal session.  And in a paper that grew out of my dissertation, I analyzed the moot as being parallel in its structure and its outcome to a group therapy session.  So the two parties, by listening to each other, begin to see how their behavior is viewed in the eyes in the other, and then with the help of the other people in the group they can come to reach a kind of resolution.  Now what turns out to be important is that that paper is my most frequently cited paper, my most frequently reprinted paper.  It's been printed in six or seven different places, and it has had a stronger impact outside of anthropology than in anthropology; although it has had impact in anthropology.  But it has been taken up by people in law who are looking for less formal ways of settling disputes.  So the whole movement toward neighborhood dispute resolutions, family courts, mediation, has taken that paper as a model and tried to use it to use--improve dispute settlement in our own society.  So that's something that I'm pretty pleased about (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That is ama- that's wonderful.
Story_ID: 332631
Speaker 1: There were a couple of films made about your work with the group [Kpelle] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  Yes.  There's one film ['The Cows of Dolo Ken Paye: Resolving Conflict among the Kpelle'] and one video ['Dolo Ken Paye's People Go to the Movies'].  I went back for second fieldwork in 1965, '68 [1968].  By that time, we [Gibbs and his wife, HistoryMaker Jewelle Taylor Gibbs] had two children [Geoffrey Taylor Gibbs and Lowell Gibbs], and we took the children who were ages--let's see, two and four, with us to Liberia.  And my early work had been in the town of Foquelleh in Panta Chiefdom in Bong County [Liberia].  It wasn't Bong County at the time I started.  It was a part of--a province.  But it now is Bong County.  So this time, since we had the children, they lived in Gbarnga [Liberia], which is the county seat for Bong County, about thirty-five miles away from Foquelleh, and I split my week.   So I spent half the week in the village of Foquelleh doing my work, and then I'd come back to Gbarnga and do my write-up and paperwork and be with the family.  Then I went back to Liberia in the summer of 1968, and it was in that summer that I made a film with a colleague that I had met on the second fieldwork, Marvin Silverman, who was a professor of education at San Francisco State University [San Francisco State College; San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California].  And he had developed a lot of skill in photography, cinematography because he worked with USAID [United States Agency for International Development] in the curriculum in Monrovia [Liberia] public schools.  And he discovered that for these city kids in the capital city to understand their own country, they needed to know about life and the interior, so he did films.  And long story short, we got together, and we were going to do a film called 'Foquelleh: A Modernizing Liberian Village.'  And it was going to be a straightforward, ethnographic film showing how people earned their livelihood and how they go to church and how they're educated, and so on.  And as luck would have it, we stumbled on to a dispute where a calf had been wounded because rice is the major crop and the calf was out eating a farmer's rice crop, and the farmer got angry and chopped it with a machete and brought it into town.  And we kind of--we were just standing there with the camera filming people going into church when that calf was brought into town.  And so I said to Marvin, "Well, let's do a different film.  I have material on an earlier case involving a calf-wounding.  Let's follow this case through to the end."  And we did the case, which wound up in a hot knife ordeal.  So it's a very dramatic, very dramatic kind of ending.
Story_ID: 332632
Speaker 1: And then you made a second film when you came back and you showed the first film.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  The hot knife ordeal was interesting because it's a way of testing guilt or innocence, where it's like a medieval ordeal.  And the idea is that when you're tested by the ordeal--(unclear) as to your guilt or innocence, if you are guilty you will be burned; and if you're not guilty you will not be burned.  And in my work, I've analyzed this as being parallel to the lie detector, the polygraph, in that even though this is not, in quote, science, it's what Liberians would call African science.  And that the principle that the ordeal operator is using is the same principle that the polygraph operator uses in trying to determine whether you are lying or not; that they're both based on the autonomic nervous system and nonverbal ques.  So the film that we [Gibbs and Marvin Silverman] did was called 'The Cows of Dolo Ken Paye: Resolving Conflict among the Kpelle.'  It won an award as a documentary, and it still continues to be used.  It's a short film, thirty minutes.  Four years after making it, I took it back to the village [Foquelleh, Liberia] to show it to the villagers, most of whom had never seen a movie let alone with themselves in it.  So did--took stills of them watching themselves and did an audio tape.  So we have an eight-minute video of people watching the film, and it's called 'Dolo Ken Paye's People Go to the Movies.'  So the film is the 'Cows of Dolo Ken Paye,' the video is 'Dolo Ken Paye's People Go to the Movies.'  And it was very interesting to watch their reaction to the case and what they re- what they responded to.  For example, at one point, there is a close-up of a man who, since the movie had been made, had died.  And when people see him in living color on the full screen talking and gesturing, his presence was very strongly evoked.  And so after they had looked at the film three times, it was midnight, way past people's bedtime, they had a memorial service to commemorate him because his spirit had been so strongly evoked by seeing--being seen on the screen, which is something I wouldn't have anticipated (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Story_ID: 332633
Speaker 1: So after you come back from doing your fieldwork [in Liberia], you start teaching.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you taught at the University of Minnesota [University of Minnesota Twin Cities, Minneapolis, Minnesota].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you were visiting professor at Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York].  Correct?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I was visiting professor at Cornell one summer, the summer of 1962, which was ten years after I had graduated.  And our first child, Geoffrey [Geoffrey Taylor Gibbs], was born in 1961.  So he was about fifteen months old.  And we went back to Ithaca [New York], and we rented a cottage on Cayuga Lake.  And my parents [Huldah Hortense Dabney Gibbs and James Lowell Gibbs, Sr.] couldn't have been more thrilled to have their son return to Ithaca with a wife [HistoryMaker Jewelle Taylor Gibbs] and a grandchild, and to have the cottage on Cayuga Lake.  So I worked hard that summer.  I taught in the mornings and I wrote in the afternoons, and then we would come home for a wonderful dinner overlooking the lake.  And it was a great summer (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's good.
Speaker 2: A lot of things came together.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: It was a nice time, nice time.
Story_ID: 332634
Speaker 1: And then you came to Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Where you've been for--
Speaker 2: I came to Stanford--I was at Minnesota [University of Minnesota Twin Cities, Minneapolis, Minnesota] from '59 [1959] to '65 [1965]; and then '65 [1965], '66 [1966] we went back to Liberia for the second fieldwork that I mentioned to you.  And then we came to Stanford and been here ever since.
Speaker 1: Why did you come to Stanford?  Because they offered you a job, or did you--were you interested in coming to California (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, that's a good question.
Speaker 1: Because everything you--was East Coast, and now you come to the other side of the (unclear)--
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  I'm glad you asked that.  In the summer of, I think it was 1961, I've forgotten exactly which summer, remember the Peace Corps got started around that time.  And they were going to train a group to go to Liberia, the first Peace Corps group to go to Liberia.  And the people who were selected to train that group were Johnnetta Cole [Johnnetta B. Cole] and her first husband, Bob Cole [Robert Cole].  She's also an African American anthropologist, somewhat younger; had worked in Liberia and knew about my work although we had never met.  And she called me and said, "You know, we're going to be leading this--training this group, and would you like to come out and help us for a week.  We're going to be at San Francisco State University [San Francisco State College; San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California]."  I said, "Sure.  I'd love to go."  And came out, we had a very good week training the students, getting to know each other.  And when I got back to Minnesota, I said to my wife, "You know, my dream would be someday to be a visiting professor for a semester in California.  I love San Francisco [California]."  At that point, she had never been to San Francisco, and that was my first trip to California.  And that was in 1961.  So I go back to Minnesota.  I was very happy in Minnesota.  It was a good place to be.  We had a good life in the university and in the community.  So I was not looking for a job.  I was very successful in teaching introductory anthropology at Minnesota.  I had a class that met in the auditorium of the Museum of Natural History [Bell Museum of Natural History, Minneapolis, Minnesota] of five hundred students.  And I think word got around in anthropology that there was this young instructor in Minnesota who had a pretty good introductory course.  And Stanford was looking for, number one, an Africanist because they were expanding the international programs; and number two, hopefully an Africanist who could also teach introductory anthropology.  So I was invited out and I thought, you know, they're not really serious, but I'll go and see.  And lo and behold, they made the offer, and I said, "Well, you know, my wife has never been to California.  I'd better consider this.  We've got to let her see what she'd be coming to."  So in twenty-four hours she arranged babysitters and was here (laughter).  And we came out and we've stayed.
Speaker 1: She doesn't teach at Stanford.  She teaches across the bay [San Francisco Bay] at the other school (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's right.  She taught--she did her Ph.D. in midlife and had a phenomenal career of teaching at University of California, Berkeley [Berkeley, California].  So I say we have a mixed marriage (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You certainly do.
Speaker 2: --because we teach at Berkeley and Stanford.
Speaker 1: And people don't understand there's a big rivalry between the schools.
Speaker 2: Indeed.
Speaker 1: And they--you often do not speak to each other.
Speaker 2: Indeed.
Speaker 1: So you--this is a miracle marriage.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: I mean, you're still together.  It's absolutely a miracle.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  In spite of.  Well, I think Jewelle [HistoryMaker Jewelle Taylor Gibbs] got indoctrinated because she was living on the Stanford campus for several years before she--a few years--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --then she went back for her master's degree first, not too long after we got here.
Story_ID: 332635
Speaker 1: Could you tell us a little bit about your career here?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, as I said, I started out teaching anthropology.  I've always focused a lot on undergraduate teaching.  I taught the course in introductory anthropology; a course in culture and personality, going back to my work with Cora Du Bois; and, of course, peoples and cultures of Africa; and later African societies in a changing world.  I taught ethnographic film, and that's where the idea for the--I taught the course before I did the film ['The Cows of Dolo Ken Paye: Resolving Conflict among the Kpelle'].  And I taught a course called Film Studies of African American Culture; taught a seminar on African law; taught an innovative--a comparative law course called Law and Radically Different Cultures.  That was taught in the law school [Stanford Law School, Stanford, California], comparing law of the United States, China, Egypt and Botswana.  Those were some of the things I did in teaching.  Fairly early on, I got invited to be Stanford's [Stanford University, Stanford, California] first dean of undergraduate studies.  There was a sort of internal look at Stanford in the 1960s.  And one of the conclusions was that undergraduate education needed to be strengthened, that the university was being dominated too much by the graduate schools and research.  And that to do that it would be good to have a new position, a position to be called dean of undergraduate studies for a person that would be within the university, an advocate for undergraduate education.  So I was asked to accept that post and I did and did it for six years.  And as I was saying earlier, that some of my early experience in residential education came to bear, some of what we were able to do successfully was to expand the idea of research opportunities for undergraduates.  So one of the things I'm very proud of is having, with their permission, stolen from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], the idea of an undergraduate research opportunities office, where you would have an office that would create funding for undergraduates to be able to do real research.  And, of course, knowing what I told you about the impact of the research I did in Elmira [New York] as an undergraduate [at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York], I was gung-ho about what undergraduate research can do in terms of training people and giving them a commitment to academic careers.  So that's one of the things that I was able to do as dean of undergraduate studies.
Story_ID: 332636
Speaker 1: Now you're a professor emeritus.  Right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You were ch- I'm sorry, to go back, you were chairperson of the Department of Anthropology [at Stanford University, Stanford, California], then you retired.  When did you retire?
Speaker 2: In--January 1st, 1997.
Speaker 1: That's a long time.
Speaker 2: It's been (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) It's been almost ten years.
Speaker 2: It's been a while.  There were a couple of other administrative posts along the way.  I was chairman of the Department of Anthropology in the late '80s [1980s].  I was co-director of the Stanford/Berkeley program in African studies [Stanford/Berkeley Joint Center for African Studies].  I was the acting director of the program in African and African American studies for a quarter or so before Drake [St. Clair Drake] came on board.  So I'm sort of a placeholder for him.  So my career has been a career that has had more administrative--more of an administrative component than many people have.  And I think it goes back to those days in Ithaca [New York] and Watermargin [at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York].  I've always been pulled in two directions.  The one direction of academics and scholarship and teaching, but the other direction of activism and making a better world that you could see in my work with the Cornell NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], with Watermargin; with things that we haven't mentioned.  In Minnesota, I was the--on the State Commission Against Discrimination; I was on the Minneapolis [Minnesota] Fair Unemployment Practices Commission [sic. Fair Employment Practices Commission].  Back in the '80s [1980s] I worked with the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies [Washington, D.C.] as a member of a committee called CPRJ, Committee for Policy--Committee for Policy and Racial Justice [sic. Committee of Policy for Racial Justice].  There were always these pulls in that kind of direction.  I've served on some--
Speaker 1: Many.
Speaker 2: -some boards.  I was a trustee at Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --a trustee at Mills College [Oakland, California].  So, always pulled in those two directions.  And I guess the tension will ever be there.
Story_ID: 332637
Speaker 1: So, you've done all this wonderful work.  And now your life has taken a change since you've--you've always been teaching in college.  And you're doing volunteer work with some kind of the opposite of the educational--
Speaker 2: Yes.  At the moment I'm a volunteer in a program in East Palo Alto [California] in an elementary school, Belle Haven Elementary School [Menlo Park, California].  The program is called YES Reading.  And it involves tutoring children who need some special support in being able to read.  And I do that one afternoon a week and work with two youngsters.  One is a first-grader, and one is a fourth-grader.  And it's another way of giving back and resurrecting some of the skills you had as a parent when you were teaching your own children to read.  And it's a good way, I think, of helping and feeling that you're doing something useful.  And I like it.
Speaker 1: It must--can you--East Palo Alto, for people who don't know about East Palo Alto.  Could you describe the community a little bit?  It's very different from the Stanford [California] community.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  East Palo Alto is on the other side of the freeway, Highway 101 [U.S. Route 101].  And when we came here in 1966, East Palo Alto was very predominantly an African American community, a largely working-class community, but not entirely so.  And over the years since then, it's now been forty years, the population has shifted, and it's not so strong African American.  You now have a strong Mexican American, South Asian Islanders, South Asians, Vietnamese.  But I would say now the largest element of the population in East Palo Alto is Mexican American.  And the need for strengthening education is still there, even though the composition of the community has changed--
Story_ID: 332638
Speaker 1: So we've been talking about your career.  Is there anything else you'd like to mention that we haven't had a chance to talk about?
Speaker 2: I guess I would mention the--how do I want to put it?  One of the things I was able to do as dean of undergraduate studies [at Stanford University, Stanford, California] was to--and there was a lot of--this was during the time of the Vietnam War, so there was a lot of concern about social issues and activism and so on.  And we had, what, at the time were called student-initiated programs, where with the sponsorship of a faculty member, a student could teach a course, or could find an expert in the field who might not be a faculty member to teach a course dealing with social and political issues, like smoking; like issues with regard to apartheid and so on.  And at that point, these were sort of parallel to the curriculum and a kind of para-curriculum.  And as dean of undergraduate studies, I was sort of in the middle in power to accredit these courses, but told by the faculty to make sure that they were academically worthy.  And what has happened over the years is that that kind of dimension for a course--of putting into a course connections with issues that have to do with politics and so on, has now become regularized.  So it no longer has to be outside the curriculum.  I won't take all the credit for that.  I think it's partly because the faculty who were in graduate school at the time of the Vietnam War had that approach as part of the way they see the world.  And as they have become more senior, it's worked its way into the regular curriculum.  So that's another sort of byproduct of the time as undergraduate--as dean of undergraduate studies.
Story_ID: 332639
Speaker 1: I guess, in terms of wrap-up, I think the thread I see for anyone who's African American, of course, that's a big--important part of your life in a thread, and I would see the focus that I got from my parents' [Huldah Hortense Dabney Gibbs and James Lowell Gibbs, Sr.] pride in being African American as being one thread.  And a second thread that I also got from my parents, of being committed to community and building community and trying to see community not just in personal terms, but in systemic terms.  My parents didn't always phrase it this way, but that's what they were doing.  In our table talk at dinner, there was a sense of understanding the patterns of how this community works and why certain people have power and other people don't and so on.  And that's been a kind of thread that I've tried to build on professionally in terms of studying it as an anthropologist, to better understand it and imparting it as a teacher.  One of the thrills of teaching anthropology, especially introductory anthropology, is that you are working with people at a time when they are young in their collegiate careers, and you're helping them to see what all cultures have in common, what's unique about culture.  It's a real eye-opener.  And then, finally, you do this with your own family, and we [Gibbs and his wife, HistoryMaker Jewelle Taylor Gibbs] have tried to do this with our children [Geoffrey Taylor Gibbs and Lowell Gibbs], and hopefully, someday soon, there'll be a grandchild and we'll be able to have another go at it.
Story_ID: 332640
Speaker 1: You are, (unclear) beginning another chapter in your life, and you have many, many more chapters to write in your story.  Is there something else you would like to accomplish yourself?  There's other things you'd like to do?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd like to learn a little more about family genealogy and background.  So I'm going to pursue that.  And then there's some things I'd like to do in terms of tidying up some aspects of my life, like the proverbial cleaning out the garage.  People who don't live in California and have attics and basements will not understand that.  But that's on a minor level.  On a more major level, getting my field photographs in order and my field notes to give them to an archive so that future--people in the future who want to continue to understand Liberia will be able to build on what I've done.  And I think those are the major things.  And continue to enjoy life with my family, and continue to travel as long as I can.  I'm sorry I won't be around for another fifty years to see how some of the current issues and concerns got resolved, but one has to hope that what you have imparted to your students and your family will be used to see that that resolution is a good one.

Speaker 1: When we started talking you were taking about when you were an undergraduate [at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York], how few African American students there were in college.  And it seems as though in the '60s [1960s] and the '80s [1980s], we have this increase in numbers.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And now it seems to be more of a decrease.  I don't know if you've noticed that, too.  How do you see the future of African Americans in college?  Do you see it decreasing, or is it staying stable?
Speaker 2: It's--well, let me speak from the Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California] point of view.  It seems pretty stable.  The concern I would see is the changing gender ratio and the fact that we have proportionately so many more women than men.  It's great to see the women, and they do marvelously well.  But for our group as a whole, the fact that fewer men and sometimes increasingly fewer men are not pursuing higher education is a concern.  So that's one concern.  A second concern is the relatively small number of African American students who go on to academic careers.  Students are always saying, "We want more black faculty."  And my response is, "Well, you can't have more black faculty if you're all going to go to law school and business school and work in the corporate sector.  Somebody's got to go get a Ph.D. and make that commitment."  So we have some programs that are aimed in that direction.  But they're not being as successful as I would like to, like to see them.  So that is a concern.
Story_ID: 332642
Speaker 1: Do you have any regrets?  Is there something you would have liked to have done, or something you would have liked to have done differently?
Speaker 2: That is a good question (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I guess if I were to live it--apart from changing fields completely--you know, I mentioned at a young age wanting to be a commercial artist.  I also considered being an architect.  And I was convinced--persuaded that that would not be for me, because to be a good architect you have to be strong in math.  I've since learned that that's not true.  You've got to be able to know enough math to do the structures so that the building doesn't fall down, or know who to hire to do that for you.  So that was a--if I were starting all over again, I would give it a little more consideration, but probably still come back to anthropology.  Let's see what else.  I kind of lost my thought there, digressed a little bit.  I don't know what I would do--oh, yes.  I've got it.  I would try to have a better balance between academics and activism.  I think, maybe looking back on my academic career, I spent a little too much time trying to help to make the university a better place.  And I would--if I were doing it again, I would leave more of that to other people and do more with my own scholarship, and follow up more on some of the things that I started, like, following up the implications of the Kpelle moot for dispute resolution in our own society.  I think I would do more with that.  Maybe do more with looking at more formal analysis of the ordeal and the mechanisms that are involved.  But I think I would say the main thing I would do differently is altering that balance between activism and scholarship.  So thank you for giving me a chance to say that (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, you're welcome.
Story_ID: 332643
Speaker 1: We talked a little bit about your values.  Are there any really, really important values you would like to pass on, not only to your students but maybe to your future grandchildren?
Speaker 2: Well, I think it's hard to answer that without sounding cliche.  But the value of education and having an education, you know, as our grandparents used to tell us, get your education.  Once it's in your head, nobody can take it away.  I'd certain impart that.  I would impart the value of caring for other people.  Not just your family.  Not just your ethnic group.  But caring for people in general, and finding ways to express that care, to put it into action.  That value.  That's important.
Story_ID: 332644
Speaker 1: How would you like your profess- your colleagues to remember you?  This is (laughter) kind of morbid (laughter).  What do you--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, I have an inkling of how they remember me.
Speaker 1: This is how you want them to remember you (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Well, I would like them to remember the scholarship that I did.  It's not as big in volume as some people, but what's there I think is significant.  And I would like that to be remembered.  I would like my example to be remembered, the example of trying this tricky of balancing scholarship and activism.  I think that's especially a problem with many, many minority scholars.  It's an issue, because both are important to us, and we don't have that many mentors who can tell us how to do it.  So that's, I guess, the one I would want to focus on the most.  I do have some sense of how my colleagues will look at me, because there's an award [James Lowell Gibbs Jr. Award for Outstanding Service in Anthropological Sciences] in the Department of Anthropological Sciences [Department of Anthropology, Stanford University, Stanford, California] that's named after me that goes to the student or students who have contributed the most to the department in terms of activities and support of others and so on.  So if they don't remember my scholarship, evidently they're going to remember that dimension.

Speaker 1: You mentioned you have two sons.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Geoffrey [Geoffrey Taylor Gibbs] and--
Speaker 2: Geoffrey and Lowell [Lowell Gibbs].
Speaker 1: --and Lowell.  How would you--what would you like, if you could sit down and talk to them, what would you like to say to them to--just to tell them--what would you like for them to tell their grandchildren about you?  Because you'll be around to tell their children.  What would you like them to tell their grandchildren, your great-grandchildren about you?
Speaker 2: Well, I hope they'll remember who their great-grandfather was.  You know, these things get diluted as time goes on.  I suspect that the kinds of things they will talk about are not so much what I did professionally, because they are in different professions, so.  Our [Gibbs and his wife, HistoryMaker Jewelle Taylor Gibbs] oldest son, Geoffrey, is a lawyer; our younger son, Lowell, is an investment advisor.  So the things that they will remember and pass on are the things from the family context.  And I think the things that they'll remember is the things that we did together as a family.  I think they will remember the support that we gave them by going to their ballgames and their other activities; that we did those things as a family.  I think they will remember family conversations about politics and how you use politics and what politics are all about.  And I hope that'll be passed on.  My mother [Huldah Hortense Dabney Gibbs] used to talk about her father and his love of reading the newspaper, and that he was a follower of Eugene Debs [Eugene V. Debs], so a Socialist.  And that love of reading the newspaper was very much a part of what I got from my parents, especially my mother who was a more avid reader than my father [James Lowell Gibbs, Sr.].  And I notice that our boys--and we are both avid newspaper readers, and, of course, we can do it even more in retirement; we can really spend time with The New York Times--and I notice our boys are very avid newspaper readers.  And sometimes they even email us clippings and references, and so that sense of engagement, I think, is something that will be passed on.  Now, Lord knows, in a couple of generations, there may not be a newspaper.  It may be something online.  But, hopefully that sense of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear) that love of learning.
Speaker 2: --of learning and being engaged for a purpose.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This has been a wonderful, wonderful interview.  I want to thank you for sharing your life with me.  I've learned so much.  You've been so gracious to open your home to us.  And I don't know how we can repay you.  It's just been a wonderful, wonderful experience.  Thank you so much.
Speaker 2: Well, it's been wonderful for me.
Speaker 1: Well, good.
Speaker 2: You're a great interviewer.
Speaker 1: Oh.  Well, thank you (laughter).
Speaker 2: Terrific questions.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it's wonderful to have an opportunity to try to reflect about one's life and consider what it has meant, what it has been, and what the implications may be for future generations.  I think The HistoryMakers project is great.
Speaker 1: Oh, I do, too.
Speaker 2: And hopefully it will have an impact for many years to come--

Speaker 1: This is a picture that was taken by the San Jose Mercury [The Mercury News] of me and my wife, Jewelle, in 1993.  It was in conjunction with an article about the two of us being two African American professors holding endowed university chairs, because Jewelle was the first African American woman to have, at the University of California, whole system, to have an endowed chair.  And I'm the first holder of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Centennial Professor [Martin Luther King Jr. Centennial Professor of Anthropology Emeritus] chair at Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California].

Speaker 2: Okay.  This is a 1976, as I was coming to the end of my six years as dean of undergraduate studies.  This was a period in my life when I had a beard, which I started in 1975, getting ready for the bicentennial, and I kept until 1986.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA SPEAKER):  Very good.  Next.
Speaker 2: Okay.

Speaker 1: It's okay?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA SPEAKER):  So far so good.
Speaker 1: This is me in, I think, 1942--no, probably '43 [1943].  I was in junior high school [Frank David Boynton Junior High School, Ithaca, New York], it was in conjunction with winning a war bond slogan contest.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA SPEAKER):  Okay.  Next.
Speaker 2: Okay.  This is the last one.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA SPEAKER):  Okay.  You can clip that one.  It's a little bit wider on the other dimension, so if you just want to rotate it 90 degrees counter clockwise.  That's great.  Go ahead.
Speaker 2: This is an article from the Ithaca Journal, and it's, I think, 1937.  It's the dedication of Southside Community Center [Ithaca, New York].  My father, in the middle, is the first executive director.  And the person who did the dedication was Eleanor Roosevelt on the left.
