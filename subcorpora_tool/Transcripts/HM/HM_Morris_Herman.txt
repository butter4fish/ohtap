Speaker 1: All right.  Now, before we go into depth, there are five "People Magazine"-ish type questions I am compelled to ask you and they only require a short answer.  The first one is:  Sir, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Barbeque.  Basically ribs.
Speaker 1: That's a good Memphis [Tennessee] answer.
Speaker 2: (Laughs.)
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Red.
Speaker 1: Okay.  A favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Summer.  Hot and humid.
Speaker 1: Okay.  A favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Anywhere there's an ocean and a beach.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, finally, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I've got so many it's legendary.  One I've used a lot frequently is "it is better to be lucky than good."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But if you're good, you can make your own luck.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 93759
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, tell me about your family history.  How far back can you trace your family?
Speaker 2: I've done some research, and I can go back a couple two or three generations before I hit the wall that most black folks run into of slavery.  On my father's side, my grandfather, Jeff Morris, was born in 1861 and was a slave.  And on my mother's side, I can go back to Passion Finger.  I believe she was Finger.
Speaker 1: F-E-N?
Speaker 2: F-I-N-G-E-R.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Who, I believe, was born in Virginia, ended up in Mississippi; and she would be a great-grandmother.  And I think she's probably the earliest--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: About when was she born?
Speaker 2: She would have been born in the early 1800s; 1830s or '40s [1840s] or so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, are there any stories in your family that have passed about life in the nineteenth century or the early part of the twentieth century?
Speaker 2: Oh, there're all kinds of stories and lore that you hear, most in my--on my father's side, but the most interesting aspect or story is my grandfather's departure from Alabama.  He was born in Alabama, and apparently--well I guess I can go back one generation more, 'cause his mother, whose name escapes me at the moment, but apparently, he left Alabama because his father, who was Irish or believed to be Irish, would not acknowledge him and recognize him, and moved west, ultimately ending up in Mississippi and then ending up in Memphis; came to Memphis in the early 1900s.  So the most interesting aspect is that he migrated here and started the Morris clan here in Memphis.  My--on my mother's side of the family, there are lot more colorful stories, and then they're a lot better known primarily as a result of a sibling of my grandmother, who lived well past 100 and would share oral history with us.  The two most interesting to me were the great matriarch of the family, Passion Finger, was apparently the nursemaid or care provider of a fairly prominent family, white family, in Northern Mississippi.  And at the time of--two things have supported that; one is that she was the owner of property which became the property of the family, was deeded to her by this family, and, of course, it was subdivided between--at her passing--between my grandmother and her siblings.  But it had to be something like well in excess of a couple of hundred acres.  And, in fact, there's a whole block--or at one time there was a block of Tippah County, Mississippi, where this was that was basically all kinfolk or relatives and all going back to this one, one great matriarch.
Story_ID: 93760
Speaker 1: The other interesting story about her [Passion Finger] is that, upon her death--and she also gave the church the plot that it was built on--but upon her death, she was taken--following her funeral--she was taken from the church by this family that she had provided care for--and the child, being a grown man that she had cared for--and buried in the Finger cemetery--Finger family cemetery, not the black Finger family, but the Finger family cemetery, with a statement with something to the effect that "This was my black mama," and or something probably has translated through the years, but it's not clear and it's never been really, fully explained to me that this was voluntary or involuntary, but it was certainly an assertion of some kind of relationship of significance that was recognized even after her passing.  So she's buried somewhere in the white Finger plot; so cemetery somewhere down there in North Mississippi; probably in Tippah County.  And, of course--
Speaker 2: You have black relatives--had access to a permanent grave.
Speaker 1: Right.  And the rest are buried in the cemeteries of several churches, including the one that she provided the land for. On my grandfather's side, my maternal grandfather's side, the most interesting story is that he wasn't around for very long, and hopefully, the statute of limitations has run on much of it.  He ended up, as a matter of fact, in jail, in prison somewhere in Mississippi.  These are interesting stories.  Some might be true, some might not be true; most of them are probably lore and oral history.  But there is at least some verification on this that he went to jail in the--it must have been the '30s [1930s]--must have been somewhere around the '30s or late '20s [1920s], 1920, 1930, for killing a white man; a white person, in Mississippi or being somehow involved or associated.  It's hard to imagine that he didn't go to the gallows, but apparently he went to jail.  And at some point, he escaped.  And there's an interesting story, as it was related to me, that he was told that as a trustee in jail at some point by an overseer or guard to get out of here, he took it literally and he got literally out of there.  And he escaped.  He is, said by my mother [Reba Garrett Watson], to have visited.  And she said to have seen him only once, and he came through and they had to go to some secure place to see him and that was the last time they saw him.  He was last heard of moving west toward Arkansas and has not been seen or heard of since.  And this is years ago.  That's part of the lore and oral history in the Morris family, the Morris-Garrett-Finger family.
Speaker 2: There's a story that he was accused of--wrongfully accused of killing a person?
Speaker 1: The details suggest that he was not wrongfully accused, but he was justifiably--he was justified in his actions.  And I've always kind of pieced together and assumed that there was some validity to that by the simple fact that a white person did die, it was in the 1930s, and he was not immediately taken and put to death himself.  It admit to me that he did not commit the offense or that there was some mitigating circumstance which said that, as opposed to instant death, he would suffer slow death in prison over a period of years.  He exercised a little self help and removed himself from that situation.  But that was the last time that he was seen or heard or known.  And, of course, that was my grandmother's father.
Story_ID: 93761
Speaker 1: I guess the other, again, great oral history and lore on my grandmother's--on my mother's side is the Joe Braddock (ph.) stories.  Of course, it's--Joe Braddock was apparently a superior worker, and he was a slave, was apparently a superior worker and apparently had an awful lot of children.  And, as a matter of fact, every year I'll get a letter from someone regarding the Braddock reunion, because he's got still an awful lot of descendants.  And apparently, Joe was just a beautiful African-American man; very, very dark-skinned complexion, as was my grandmother; large--tall and large in stature and was very much appreciated; and, in fact, was--is said to have been sold on at least one occasion for a superior price, which I don't have any way to appreciate or understand it more than just--more than a Chevy (unclear) better than an Oldsmobile, probably a Cadillac.  That's pretty much the oral history.  There's a lot more and interesting stories.  My aunt, Debbie, who lived to be more than 100, passed away several years ago.  But I guess about ten years before she passed, she let me kind of record some of this oral history.  And it's just very rich and interesting and probably not that atypical history, but she apparently was a teacher of some distinction and description, which has always fascinated me about her because, at the time, as I understood the times, she was probably not that much formally educated.  But she was very well-spoken and educated in the same sense and context and intonation as Barbara Jordan, as a matter of fact.  And she, too, as a great Braddock descendant, was a very big woman in terms of height, being over at least six feet--over six feet tall and probably in her prime; spoke the most perfect English literally with the same tone and intonation as Barbara Jordan that I have ever encountered.  I always was fascinated by how or where she came to, had to developed those particular skills in elocution.  She, in her later years--in fact, for the past twenty--last twenty years of her life, was just about completely blind as a result of glaucoma.  And so she didn't have any notes or anything to reference, but she could give you almost chapter and verse, twenty volumes worth of family history as well as long dissertations on many other subjects of interests in world and national history over the term of her life without reference to note or prompt or guidance.  She was just literally a fascinating good storyteller and a tremendous repository of knowledge and information.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, she's your--
Speaker 1: She's my grandmother's sister.
Speaker 2: So your great aunt.
Speaker 1: My great aunt.
Story_ID: 93762
Speaker 1: She, it's--one of the good things about our family and our family tradition, and I didn't really appreciate it until I got older, is that part of it was probably just an extension of Sunday dinner.  But periodically over my life and certainly during my younger years, we would have gatherings-- children's day, Father's Day--where it was kind of a potluck lunch.  Every family would pack the equivalent of a picnic basket and you'd have a table, perhaps 50 feet long, and you would just go from place to place to sample what everyone had brought.  One of these days or one of these important dates was Debbie's birthday, which was, again, a cause for everybody to come together and I suspect--in fact, I believe she was the oldest of the siblings and was probably the mother figure for many of them.  My grandmother, on the other hand, was the youngest--was the baby of the family.  But every year we would go to Aunt Debbie's house and it'll be sometimes sixty, seventy, counting grandkids, a hundred folks there getting to know each other again.  And it was on those occasions that she would sit down and talk about some of her experiences and some of the family experiences.  And that's how those stories got passed along.
Story_ID: 93763
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about your father.  Can you give us his full name and spell it for us, and his date and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Herman Morris.  My sister [Carol Morris] is much better at that than I am.  And he was born in September in Memphis [Tennessee] in 1922.  I'll need to find his date of birth.  My sister is the--is much better at that.  He passed December 18th in 1969.  He basically grew up here.  He was the youngest, again, of about twelve siblings born to Jeff and Lottie Morris.
Speaker 1: Now this is the same Jeff Morris who was born in 1861?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.  It's--Jeff was a hell of a guy.
Speaker 1: He was born during slavery.
Speaker 2: He was born during slavery and had from 19--I guess his oldest child was--would have been born sometime around 1908.  And his last child, my father, would have been born in 1922.  He--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: So Jeff Morris then was about--oh, he's about sixty then.
Speaker 2: He would have been--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He would--he was fairly old.  My grandmother, Lottie, was a lot younger.  And, in fact, she probably--and I should have looked at that--she probably was in her twenties, if that old, when they first came together.  And they pretty much stayed together until he passed and had several--had at least one child that died at birth, and another I think that passed relatively early in life.
Speaker 1: And that's out of the twelve?
Speaker 2: It's probably out of the ten.  Out of the ten.  And she had--the oldest was I think roughly about ten.  There were--counting the ones that were miscarriage or died at birth.
Story_ID: 93764
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. All right.  Well, okay.  Well, continuing, what are the--what did your father [Herman Morris] do for a living?  I mean, what was he like and what kind of (unclear) did he have?  Let's go through the whole (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My--it's interesting.  I did some wayside research, fished around and found a death certificate on my grandfather.  And he was a--he came to Memphis [Tennessee] and was a porter--not a railroad porter, but I have surmised a building porter.  My father was the youngest of the family of ten and basically went to school, public schools here in Memphis until about the eighth grade when he quit school, as I've understood the story, to go to work.  And he worked at various and sundry odd jobs, I guess, everything from selling newspapers to running groceries to basically manual labor, starting at about the age of thirteen.  He was an interesting person.  He was--he had the most beautiful hands that you'd see.  In fact, he played the piano, played by ear and sang; and both of which he did extremely well, but had never taken--formally been trained.  Had never taken music, either voice or piano, but he could sit at a piano and play.  He was somewhat frustrated and bitter about having quit school and would always remind me that I could have been a surgeon, because he had literally a surgeon's hands, and he really could and ultimately did accomplish quite a bit in light of those limitations, not having had benefit of a lot of education.  He also had, and these are just kind of the things that seemed to me to stand out about some of the issues and adversity that he overcame.  He was born with what I've been told is a clubfoot.  I don't know what that necessarily is, but I think it's--it was turned at an angle, which made it difficult for him to walk or learn to walk, and for a significant part of his early life and development he wore a brace to straighten the foot out, to turn it into a more proper alignment.  And I think is something that stood out in his mind enough for him to mention it to me in my time as we grew up.  It's something that either--that had a significant impact on him.  He was a very, very strict disciplinarian; very disciplined; very stern person; and a very loving person.  He--the community that we grew up in was a--basically about a thousand apartments.  And, notwithstanding that and notwithstanding his lack of education--and, of course, he ultimately went to work at Sears and Roebuck and Company [Sears, Roebuck & Company], as an elevator operator.  The thing I remember most about him is that--were two things--three, four--well, quite a bit.  He had a tremendous impact on him for a lot of reasons, which I can tell you Daddy stories forever.  But, the thing I remember most about him is that every day--well, first thing is that he bought a house at a time when--that wasn't the easiest thing to do--we still own that house, as a matter of fact.  On an elevator operator's pay he bought a house.  I ran into the guy not too long ago that built the house, and even he remembered the small development.  On an elevator operator's pay, he was somehow able to put together enough money and bought a house.  The house probably sold for about $6,000 in 1953 or '-4 [1954], and he paid for it.
Story_ID: 93765
Speaker 1: Every morning he [Herman Morris] would get up.  He would pack his lunch or my mother [Reba Garrett Watson] would and then put it in a brown paper bag, probably a sandwich.  He would get his raincoat, which was a little plastic raincoat in a pack, his umbrella; he would put on a suit coat, a tie and a white shirt; and he would take out from our house, walk two blocks to the bus stop.  He didn't have car, and as far as I know, never learned or knew how to drive.  I never saw him drive.  Catch the bus, would drive to work--would ride to work, and every evening at about four or five, you could look down the street and you'd see him walking down the street, fast walker or brisk walker; umbrella, hat, coat and tie.  He looked like a lawyer to me.  He dressed very professionally and he would go to work.  And I'm sure he would go his locker; take off his jacket; put on his uniform, which again, required him to wear a coat and tie; and he would run the elevator up and down the floors--it was a manual elevator--for the men and women coming in, usually professionals in the main offices at Sears and Roebuck here in Memphis [Tennessee].  Never missed a day of work.  Never was late a day, and was always--in fact, my friends would tell me, and even now my close friends from way back when we were growing up, will say that, "We used to see your father every day and he would go to work and he'd always have on a coat and tie."  And they didn't know what he did either, but he was a role model.
Story_ID: 92321
Speaker 1: Now what was your father's birthday?
Speaker 2: My father [Herman Morris] was born October 30th in 1922.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The other thing that was interesting in lore and stories, just to give you some additional dimension and insight, at some point when my grandmother passed, there was a will and property.  I guess this would have been in the late '50s [1950s].  And the siblings, those that were still alive, ended up at a lawyer's office--I met the lawyer some years later, even--and were in the process of resolving the estate of what was left.  And the only thing that I can recall of the story that was shared with me was that there was something not right about the deal or the papers they had been given by the lawyer to sign.  And the one hold out, the one person that refused to accept bad deal or raw deal was my father.  Now, he was indulged quite a bit because he was the baby.  But it is said that he took the documents that had simply been put in front of him to sign, the way lawyers did, particularly poor and particularly black folk during that era, and just told to sign; and then apparently took all of their signatures to consummate whatever transaction; he refused, which was a stand of some conviction and courage, and essentially, took the documents up on one of the top floors--a big firm--in an office building here in downtown Memphis [Tennessee]--and said he would jump out the window to his death before he would sign that document, because he didn't think the deal was right.  He didn't think what they were doing right.  He took a stand of conviction and courage that ultimately worked out to the better advantage and benefit of the entire family, his brothers and sisters.  But it was interesting that he, the youngest, was the one that took that posture and position on that issue.  He was a very complex and interesting and very talented--and I have no doubt that he could have been a doctor or a lawyer but for some of the difficulties and times that he had to endure.  He ultimately, as most folks who had the kind of profession he did, lost his job as an elevator operator because, as you know, they're now self or automatic elevators.  And for a long time, he was unemployed.  And, in fact, my parents divorced.  He had met my mother [Reba Garrett Watson] while they were employed there at Sears [Roebuck, & Company], and she was a waitress there in the lunchroom, and he was an elevator operator.  She says he was a good-looking man.  And I assume that's why they ended up getting married.  But, he ended up unemployed, and my sister and my mother moved away and I stayed with him.  And those were difficult times.  We worked odd jobs.  We cleaned up churches on Saturdays--white churches on Saturdays for what pay--I never got paid.  I helped him.  He got paid.  We did a lot of just a meal and manual labor, but he worked to keep his house and to take care of his family, myself, and to pay what amount he paid to my mother under the divorce decree, which he did religiously.  I watched him as he struggled and suffered with just an eighth-grade education through the Post Office exam and through a lot of correspondence courses to get oneself ready for that exam.  And he took it a number of times.  He ultimately ended up working at a bank as a housecleaning personnel.  The interesting thing about that is that by the time he passed, and it seems to me by the time I had made it into high school--they divorced when I was probably in the sixth grade--he had moved up several ranks; and, in fact, he moved out of the cleaning department into one of the more white-collar areas dealing with--he moved from there to internal supervision of the distribution of the internal bank mail; and then from there, into a job involving the processing of checks and debits and credits that came through; which again, was a significant accomplishment for someone with just an eighth-grade education, I think testimony to his intellect, drive and determination and will to succeed.  He passed a lot of that on to my sister and myself.
Story_ID: 92322
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you tell us about your mother?  Can you give us her full name?
Speaker 2: Reba Garrett Watson.  Reba Garrett Morris Watson.  She remarried after the divorce.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when was she born and where was she born?
Speaker 2: My mother was born October 3rd in Tippah County, Mississippi, in 1928.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was her life like, and what did she do for a living?
Speaker 2: She--I've learned a lot about her the older she's gotten.  She was a typical rural Mississippi girl.  She grew up on a farm.  Most of her young life, they lived on a farm in North Mississippi, owned by a family named Roland (ph).  One of the interesting stories about this is she had two siblings, an older brother and a younger brother; she was the middle child.  I think they had also had one that had not survived.  And she went to high school there.  Obviously, the high schools there were segregated.  I understand she played basketball, as a matter of fact, which I didn't know.  And my mother was (unclear) a very attractive woman.  And she's a very old woman now, but she's very attractive woman.  And she lived on the farm until she moved to Memphis [Tennessee] at about eighteen.  Kind of an interesting story and probably something that led to some of the success of the family--certainly for one of her siblings--was that my uncle, her older brother, had done well in school and wanted to go to college.  And Mr. Roland--Mr. Rob Roland, as she recounts it, said that George--and his name was George--didn't need to go to school.  He needed to stay here, and, of course, they were essentially sharecroppers and worked on the farm.  And my grandfather and grandmother literally packed everybody up one night and in the quiet and dark of night, stole away to get to a place where my uncle could go to college, and he ultimately did.  My grandmother essentially put her foot down and said we're not going to let him, Mr. Roland, do that to our children.  So my uncle George ended up going to college.  He went to Tennessee State University [Nashville, Tennessee], did well, and ultimately came out and was an educator in administration when he passed.  But my mother came to Memphis, and she was a---she had apparently studied cosmetology, and she was a beautician.  But she ended up working up at Sears [Roebuck, & Company], a really good company, in the cafeteria and basically was a--what I interpreted it as kitchen help and then ultimately a waitress in the Sears cafeteria in the same office building where my father [Herman Morris] worked.  And, of course, she worked there for a good while.  I think when they divorced, in addition to automation, the times were where one of them had to leave.  And my father was the one to leave. Whether it was by choice or otherwise, he, knowing him, he probably would have left.  But she continued to work at Sears and ultimately ended up in a supervisory position in the security area when they moved to a little more of automation there.  So it's--she's been and still survives--she was the nurturer of the family.  My father was the strength and disciplinarian of the family, typical family.  And even at the--and the years during--after the divorce, those roles never changed.  My sister was the diplomat, and who, like my mother, is beautiful, charming and was Miss Everything; and, of course, I was that little bad Morris boy.
Story_ID: 92323
Speaker 1: Okay, tell me about your growing up.  What are some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: It's amazing to me in terms of growing up for a lot of reasons, how much freedom I enjoyed; how literally on my own and independent I was, because both of my parents worked, and this is--well, go back a few years.  The first years of my life were probably the most wonderful years.  My sister and I lived in Mississippi on a farm that my grandparents owned, and the family still owns.  It was about 100 acres.  And we lived there literally from birth 'til we were old enough to go to school.  And we ran around mostly barefoot.  We didn't have indoor plumbing.  I slept in the bed with my grandfather, and my sister slept in the bed with my grandmother.  It never occurred to me until much later that my grandparents slept in separate beds, and I suspect that was convention or convenience brought on by us (laughs), as much as anything.  But it was just a wonderful time and rich experience.  We would do everything.  A big event for us was we would drive to Memphis [Tennessee] and go to a local colonial bread factory and get a truckload of bread, these big 50-gallon bags of bread, and we would drive back to the little community in Mississippi, and we then sell the bread to mostly neighbors and family.  We'd haul water.  We'd drive to a local spring and fill up a 50-gallon barrel.  It was just a wonderful and rich time.  They had cows and horses and pigs.  And I enjoyed picking cotton.  My grandfather would plant it, and it was a family farm and we were the labor and we'd go out and pick--I enjoyed chopping cotton; learned how to do it.  And, in fact, that's the only time that I ever did.  But it's a good skill to have.  There's some lessons learned there.  I enjoyed--it was a life typical of a rural community.  Well, when I got old enough, we returned to Memphis and started school.  And we basically grew up in a segregated community and a segregated school system that was a very nurturing community and system.
Story_ID: 92324
Speaker 1: Now, what was the name of the neighborhood that you grew up in?
Speaker 2: The neighborhood is Binghampton.  We call it Binghampton, Tennessee.  It's in the heart of Memphis [Tennessee].  And it's an interesting community.  It could have been a town unto itself.  And it's an interesting black community in that it had physicians and lawyers--or a physician and a lawyer, stores.  It was an almost self-contained community isolated by several railroad tracks which offered some benefits within a nurturing community.  I was mischievous, plus I was somewhat stigmatized as the child of a divorced family.  So I was either expected to be bad or bad or was going to be bad.  And many times I lived up to that expectation.  We, my friends and I, literally had free reign and ranged and roamed all over that community from sun up to sun down and well beyond, more or less unsupervised directly; although every eye at every corner and every house knew who each one of us was and our parents.  So we were remotely supervised, we just didn't appreciate it.  And had a, as a result, a fairly liberal education in the community and on the street that was filled with a lot of opportunities to turn right or turn left, go right or go wrong.  And it's only God's graces or good luck or some guidance that saw me more often than not make right choices.  But we had that much freedom.  And my--like I said, both of my parents worked.  From the time I was in the first grade, I had--we had a house and I had a key.  I could key myself in and key myself out.  Didn't have to go to school.  Both of them were gone usually--up and gone to work when I was--my sister and I would go to school.  We walked to school, and yet, we had a sound enough foundation that we were able to manage that degree of freedom and not make too many bad mistakes.
Speaker 1: So you actually went to school (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I went to school anyway.  I shot hooky one day as a high schooler, because that's what everybody was doing, and I had never done it, and so I didn't--I wasn't in the crowd.  I couldn't talk about it 'cause I had never done it.  I was so dumb and so slow, I didn't know what you were supposed to do when you shot hooky, so I just stayed home and watched a lot of TV.  I was bored to death.  I enjoyed school.  I had--my mother [Reba Garrett Watson], the nurturer, would sit down and would read to us as kids.  And so when I hit kindergarten and the first grade, I was fully prepared--I read.  And I read ahead of a grade level and, frankly, throughout my entire education matriculation stayed ahead--well ahead a grade level.  My mother--I was trying to draw teddy bear, little simple hand drawing, and it frustrated me, 'cause I couldn't get it right.  And my mother sat me in her lap.  I was young, probably about five or six.  And she guided my hand to draw a teddy bear.  Just to show you how little things like impact you.  One of the things that I do today is art, is paint, and fairly well.  It's an outlet.  It's a release.  I trace that back perhaps to some latent talent, but more to my mother saying "Don't get upset, baby, here's the way you do that."  And that was kind of guidance and direction that continued and developed.  Well, it was like that in other aspects of my development and growth.  And so I did extremely well in school.

Speaker 1: I did extremely well in standardized testing.  And, in fact, primarily because I read so well (laughs).  And as a result, have enjoyed a fairly good and--a very good academic experience.  I participated in sports.  I was not--I was a late bloomer.  By the time I was in--and small--but by the time I was in junior high school, I had tried out twice for the football team.  The first time I was sent home.  As a ninth grader, I made the team, and they were kind of talking about the various positions, and one of my--they said, "Well, if you want to run with the ball, you can be a running back.  If you want to catch the ball, you can be a receiver.  If you want to--a lot of physical, you can be a blocker."  And so they were just--they were kind of defining and describing the roles and responsibilities.  And they said, "Now the quarterback is the guy that's running everything, and he's this and he's that."  And my friend--a lot of guys raised their hands.  My friend said, "Well, Herman, why--you know, you ought to be able--why don't you do that?"  So he encouraged me and so I was the quarterback.  I kind of knew that's what I wanted to be, but I was shy and didn't want to promote myself.  But with that, we--so I was a quarterback as my first exposure to it and I enjoyed being at the center things and being in charge.  I think that's part of the reason that I'm where I am today.  We lost every game.  But that's another story.
Speaker 2: (Unclear.)  Now, what grade school did you attend?
Speaker 1: Lester [Elementary School].
Speaker 2: Lester.
Speaker 1: I attended Lester--I started school in Ball Hill in Mississippi as probably a three-year-old, which was not much more than daycare--it was a school that had all twelve grades in one room; a black school in Northern Mississippi.; more daycare than school.  When I was old enough to come back to Memphis, I started in Miss Bell's daycare.  Then I went to Lester kindergarten, then I went to Lester Elementary School.  And from there, I went to Lester High School and graduated in 1969.  The interesting thing about--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Were they all in one building?
Speaker 1: They--well, K through 12--K through 6 is in one building.  That was about two--three blocks from our home.  Seven through 12 is in another building that's about a mile away.  I walked to school to both of those and had--it was kind of a--I tell stories.  Let me know if I bore you.
Speaker 2: No--(unclear).
Speaker 1: But I got educated in the classroom and in the street.  One of the things that happened as a result of my parents' divorce was that--oh, coincidently, one of the things that I observed reflecting back is that I got into a lot of fights.  And I won a lot of them.  And, again, it was one of those opportunities to--perhaps I should have been a boxer--but--
Story_ID: 92326
Speaker 1: --but and I lived up to it, that bad Morris boy reputation.
Speaker 2: Were you angry after your parents' divorced?
Speaker 1: Probably.  Probably.  Probably.  Not so much angry I suspect as I just wasn't going to take any crap about it.  My best friend and I--and I'll never forget this, probably as hurt as I've been about anything--my best friend and I got into an argument in the middle of class about something in the fifth grade.  And this is before my parents were actually divorced.  And, you know how it is, kids, you're one upping each other; you're not exactly playing the dozens 'cause we didn't, but we were really going at each other verbally.  And he said, "Well, at least my parents aren't separated."  And (snaps fingers), that was my hot point.  That was my hot button.  Really, it wasn't much else to say.  He was two desks away, and by the time I had covered that distance and knocked him to the floor, well, it kind of sent me to the office.  But that was just my hot button.  I didn't take any crap over that issue.  So I was probably little bit--I was dealing with it in a manner of speaking, perhaps not well, but at the same time I maintained, again, very good grades and continued to set the curve on the standardized testing that was done.
Speaker 2: Just back to that for a minute, 'cause people watching this today, and in the future, probably think it's strange that divorce would be something to be sensitive about today with so many people divorced, and people without even--without their parents having even gotten married in the first place.  So, but then in Memphis [Tennessee], was that odd to have your parents separate?
Speaker 1: Well, it was odd in my experience.  And if I look back at the community or the street that I lived on, we were poor.  We were poor.  And my parents worked in basically low-waged, even for that time, jobs; unlettered, uneducated folks-types of jobs, manual labor.  But the households there, we were--they were married couples with kids.  We were a typical American family, and a typical American street just a number of rungs lower on the economic ladder.  But we had yards, we had swings in the back, and everybody--the most--we had one school teacher and one person that worked at International Harvester, which was a really good job; and you could tell 'cause they got a new car every few years or--and the other folks--had one guy that was a porter at a bank; and we were all basically typical nuclear families, just poor and living in low-class affordable housing, but homeowners.  And so the norm for me was a two-parent household; a mother and a father; and a two-sibling household.  And that was just the norm.  I didn't appreciate that there were families out there where the parents didn't live together.  My--and, in fact, in my family, my father's sister had a husband who was in jail.  But otherwise, our family, that was the norm.  That was the prototype.  So it was abnormal to me.  And I suppose I had some bitterness about it when what I knew as a stable family environment was ripped apart.
Story_ID: 92327
Speaker 1: Were there signs that there was going to be problems or did they argue a lot--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: There--well, yeah.
Speaker 1: --or was it just kind of sudden?
Speaker 2: Well, my parents were--my father [Herman Morris] had a very, very hot temper, and, in fact, was probably a functional alcoholic; a weekend alcoholic, but it was every weekend.  And my mother [Reba Garrett Watson] says that's ultimately what told the story.  He was not physically violent, but there were a number of occasions where we had to put him to bed.  At come Friday and certainly by Saturday night, we had--you know, he was going to need help getting to bed.  And that probably contributed to it.  Whatever it was, and I guess the interesting thing is, my sister and my mother moved out, and my mother asked me, "Well, we're leaving.  Do you want to go with us or you want to stay here with your father?"  And I said, "Well, since Carol--" that's my sister--"is going with you, I'm going to stay here.  I guess I saw myself as staying there to take care of him, and, in fact, in some ways that's what I did, 'cause come Saturday nights (laughs), then I would put him to bed.  And that was kind of--probably the provocative cause.  And then, of course, my father had, I thought, much too long, harbored the hope that they would reconcile.  But my mother remarried, and, of course, we went to--and that was probably, when I think about it, one of the things where I advised him, I said--he was still even at that point a fairly good-looking, marketable guy.  Had he wanted to remarry, he might have or could have, but he didn't.  But that's basically the gist of it.  They divorced and it left some scars and marks.
Story_ID: 92328
Speaker 1: Yeah, the interesting thing about my school and education is it was segregated and it was nurturing.  And I was in the top ten percent, top of the class; and, in fact, had the highest I.Q. and test score the school had ever seen.  And it was (laughs)--it was not accidental, it was intentional, as a matter of fact.  I fell in love in the sixth grade with my sixth-grade teacher.  She had had me in the fourth grade, and I feel in love then, too.  But she was, next to my mother [Reba Garrett Watson], the most beautiful woman I had ever seen.  And, in addition, at a time when I had turmoil in my life, either because she was a good teacher, she filled a void that I had, but--and we're still very close.  As a matter of fact, her daughter tells me that I was her mother's favorite student.  Her daughter's a judge here.  But, at any rate, I would hang around and kind of mill around and staying close to her.  I heard her at lunchtime in casual conversation with one of her teacher peers say that, you know, she always remembered the smartest child and the baddest child in her class.  And I said, "Oh.  I've got to go."  I said, "I'm going to be the smartest, and I'm going to be the baddest."  (Laughs.)  "Because I want this woman to remember me."  I was bad enough for her to sit me right next to her desk so she could reach me.  But I was motivated and determined that I was going to be remembered as the smartest child.
Speaker 2: Now, this is a goal that's rarely achieved where somebody being the smartest and the baddest.  (Laughs.)  (unclear).
Speaker 1: It was a little bit schizophrenic, but it was necessary because she was absolutely a stunningly beautiful woman.  And I think she recognized that I had some potential.  And perhaps without any effort, she would have--I would have made it.  But I set out as a course and goal that that's what was going to happen, and we've kept contact even 'til today.  In fact, I'll see her this evening at an event.
Story_ID: 92329
Speaker 1: So I did well, and I participated in athletics as a relatively late bloomer and participated in a number of other activities.  And because I was strong academically; involved in athletics, quarterback and captain of the football team and all of that--and I enjoyed a good, wholesome high school experience.
Speaker 2: So you ran track too?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah.  I ran track, and it was track back then in our school [Lester High School, Memphis, Tennessee].  I mean, there were only two sports really.  There was football and basketball.  I had tried out for the basketball team and gotten cut.  So that was it.  I said, I'm not going to go through that again.
Speaker 2: (BRIEF INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: So I gravitated towards football.  I enjoyed some success.  And basically, as a tenth grader, made varsity and went up as a quarterback.  I got converted to a receiver, and basically played and enjoyed success, and occasionally we'd win a game.
Speaker 2: So you must have been fast, I guess.
Speaker 1: I was--it's interesting.  I was slow, as a matter of fact, growing up; but I worked at it.  My father [Herman Morris] was fast, and so I guess I had the genetics for it.  But I worked at it, and, in fact, later on in--I ran track.  I ran a quarter mile when I was in high school.  And I never got an opportunity to run any other shorter sprints but once or twice and did fairly well when I ran those, but I was not an experienced.  I had--I picked the sport up as a senior, and really--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Got to be strong to run quarter mile.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And I think that was--I was strong and I was determined.  I see the same thing in my son, sons, as a matter of fact.
Story_ID: 92330
Speaker 1: But I picked it up more aggressively in college where, again, I was a football player.  And I took track--picked up track in the spring and as a sprinter and ran the short sprints; had worked my way down from the quarter mile to the 200, to the 100, and, in fact, enjoyed a very successful career.  I've still got a record for the hundred at my school [Rhodes College, Memphis, Tennessee] that's probably thirty years old.  Ran a couple of times in the NCAA track meet.
Speaker 2: That's in college?
Speaker 1: College.  And made it--never made it to the finals; made it through a couple competitive heats.  It was a good experience.  Probably could have done better had I been given the opportunity in high school to run some of the shorter sprints, but we didn't discover it, and I didn't really apply myself until I got to college.  And the other thing about it is, I was determined to improve.  And I remember one day reading an article--this Russian, Valeriy Borzov, had won the hundred meters.  And it was extraordinary, 'cause there hadn't been a white man that had won the hundred meters for years.  It had been the black man's domain.
Speaker 2: Just a note on that, you know, the black review at track team got (unclear) in this meet when he (unclear).
Speaker 1: Oh, well, the thing about him, though, was he was fast, but the thing that I noticed about him was that he had just exquisite mechanics.  Mean, there was nothing wasted, you know.  Bob Hayes wobbled all over the place, and he could have run straight; his records would still be standing.  But Borzov was like a machine.  There was no wasted motion, and everything was in perfect synchrony.  "Sports Illustrated" ran an article on him and they did one of these foldout spreads and showed his entire--the entire--his entire sprinting cycle and how everything--his head never bobbed or--and his shoulders were always level.
Speaker 2: Perfect lean.
Speaker 1: The perfect lean.  And I said, "That's it."  And I took that as, "What you've got to do is develop a technique that can get every extra ounce of speed out of your body."  And I did, and I developed a running approach and style that was not exactly Borzov, but that incorporated a lot of those.  And as I did it, and it's kind of like Tiger Woods working on his swing and modifying his swing.  As I did it, my times improved.  And I ultimately set records and broke records, and I--frankly, in the short sprint, I never lost.  Not always because I was naturally the fastest, but I was the smartest in terms of technique.  And fast enough to get the most out of technique and talent.  But it was a thoughtful, conscious, planned kind of decision and approach.  I went to college and I would break it down.  And I'm meticulous, but I'd work on just starts.  And I said I'm going to be the first--the first ten yards are going to be mine.  And just would--and that was kind of how I put it together.  And when I put it all together, I had a sub-ten time, and it was just a matter of refining it.
Story_ID: 92331
Speaker 1: Okay.  Later on--I mean, you still work out, now, from what--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yep.  Yep.
Speaker 1: --(unclear) you, you know, been written about in the papers here and (unclear) still stayed in shape, and you run about twelve times a month.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I try to get out roughly about three or four times a week.  I average about three times a week, which is--you know, I'm not going to run any marathons, but I hope I don't gain fifty pounds.  But, yeah, I have--and I've done that ever since college.  I was--talk about lucky breaks.  This is interesting.  I was--I enjoyed college [Rhodes College, Memphis, Tennessee].  It's a predominantly white, small college, but I enjoyed the experience.  We did a lot of growing there.  We helped the college to grow as well.  We shut down a track meet once.  We sat-in in the president's office.  We changed things there.  And I was, for most of my time there, kind of the jock.  I was the football star, and was.  And had--a kind high point of my college career was, we were playing a game in Connecticut, and Otto Graham, legendary football player, was coach of the other team--I don't remember the team's name--but came in after the game and said to me that, "You know, I think you could perhaps get a chance to play professionally."  And I really believed that.  I had made the all-American team, at least honorable mention, and I'd been conference best back for almost my entire time in college.  And that--I was going to play professional football.  That was going to be my thing.  I still--I went to class.  I mean, that academic environment was strong.  I enjoyed that still, but I said football is just fun.  I enjoy it.  And in my senior year, I ended up literally destroying a knee, this one, which kind of said, "Well, that's going to be doubtful."  And I remember the doctor, who was the father of one of my classmates, coming over and saying to me, "Well, we're going to look at that, but one thing you need to remember:  You've got a long time to live after football."  And we were trying to--we were going to decide whether you're going to--you could do some kind of surgery and maybe we can play again this season.  Well, I took the coward's way out.  I decided I had a long time to live after football, and we decided we were going to treat it conservatively.  And we did.  It was a season-ending injury for me.  But it wasn't a life-ending injury.  And the dean and the--they're in the hospital, I had my leg up in the air in traction and all that.  The dean of the college and president came in paying their courtesy visit, and they said, "Well, what do you think you're going to do now?"  And I didn't know.  You know, my life, my plans were kind of shattered.  And I said, "Well, maybe I'll go to law school."  Just kind of flippant off-the-cuff remark.  I didn't know that it was true, and I didn't think it was true at the time, but that's kind of an interesting aspect that it suddenly--ultimately became true I did go to law school.
Story_ID: 92332
Speaker 1: Now, now, what were your favorite subjects in school prior to this time?  What were you concentrating on?  I know you were an athlete, but what were you doing?
Speaker 2: I went there [Rhodes College, Memphis, Tennessee] as a biology major, kind of pre-med.  Rigorous academic environment.  When my guidance counselor in high school mentioned the school to me, she said, "Well, you can go there.  They won't want you in any of their fraternities, but it's a pretty good school."  And she was right.  So I went there, and I went as a biology major.  Made it through the first semester of general biology, and then I met a tougher biology, and that wasn't working.  So I changed from pre-med to psychology.  Took a lot of art, did a lot of painting.  And, in fact, some of my paintings are still hanging in my home.  Took a lot of art.  I really enjoyed philosophy.  And when I had gotten to, I guess, about my senior year and post-injury, I said, "Well, I can try to stick around and do another year or maybe I ought to try to graduate."  And I looked at my hours that I accumulated and there were a couple of things I could graduate in, but economics was the one that I accumulated the most credit hours.  So--and I'd done fairly well.  I graduated as a economics major with a B-average.  Here's something that I found interesting.  Didn't appreciate it.  I went there to college, and I'd come from a segregated black high school, and there were these more or less well-to-do, and some downright wealthy white kids there, and some of them were my teammates on the football team.  But I was somewhat in my mind stigmatized or had a perception that they were smarter.  I knew they were richer.  They had cars.  And it was something of a weight.  I didn't learn until later when my friend, kid from Middle Tennessee [State University, Murfreesboro] as quarterback, and I were talking and somehow we got on the subject of grades and test scores and he said, "What were your"-- whatever it was, ACT or SAT--scores?"  And I think I had scored something like 28 or 27.  And they had scored something like 21 or 22.  And they said, "One point (unclear)?  You know, your scores were better than ours."
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're good scores.
Speaker 2: And it didn't dawn on me until then that, "Hey, I'm smarter than these guys."  I had--they hadn't intentionally perpetuated that perception as much as I had bought it, but it kind of took--the blinders fell off, and I said, "Hey, wait a minute.  I'm smarter than these guys."  Well, I wasn't necessarily smarter, but I certainly had scored better, even coming from a segregated inner city high school.  It was an interesting and a timely revelation.
Story_ID: 92333
Speaker 1: We had had occasion to, I was--we started a Black Student Association there on campus.
Speaker 2: How many black students were on campus?
Speaker 1: We had probably out of a thousand, we had, maybe, twenty.  We brought in a class of twelve.  It was like Noah's Ark.  Six men, six women--six young men, six young ladies (laughs).  We brought in a class of twelve.  It was a tumultuous time.  I was president of the Black Student Association.  I think I got ousted once or twice.  Once because of a white girlfriend.
Speaker 2: (Unclear.)
Speaker 1: Yeah.  They had--well, it really wasn't the brothers (laughs).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It was the sisters.  But anyway, I got voted out.  And once because the Young Turks had come in and had coalesced and decided they were taking over, which is--that's kind of a evolutionary thing.  That's what we did when--but we had a very, very good time, and we grew.  We helped the campus to grow.  We challenged it on issues, and we--there was one incident where we boycotted a track meet.  It was a big meet.  It might have been the conference meet and we were posting it on campus.  And the school had expelled one of our teammates for plagiarism or was in the process of doing it, and we thought it was unfair.  And we asked him, and he said, you know, it was unfair.  So we--the Black Student Association decided to picket the track meet.  And they walked out and laid on the track so that you could not have the events.  And we didn't have security on campus and didn't call the police.  That was just kind of the--and then nobody knew what to do, so the meet was kind of cancelled.  Well, the truth be known.  This is after I've been kind of kicked out of office.  But truth be known, I was running as well as I run.  I was--and my times were predictably and projected to go even more, and I needed that particular meet.  And I really didn't want it to--didn't agree with the boycott, didn't want it to happen.  So while my peers were laying on the track, I and perhaps the best athlete that I've known, a good friend of mine, Ralph Allen, who's also black; and Levi Frasier (ph), and they've got records that are still there as well--one was a hurdler and one was a decathlete--decided we would just sit out on the stage--victory stand, in chairs.  And we sat there without arms crossed and warmup suits on, kind of boycotting the boycott, as it were; and really not in support of it.  We hadn't organized it and we didn't want it.  What the perception was, though, was that, because we were standing there in the center of the field, center stage, so to speak, and these folks were out laying on the tracks (laughs), the perception was that we had organized it and orchestrated it; not just with the administration, but also with--for a lot of the folks that were out there laying on the track.  Now, the Young Turks that had put it together knew better, but they weren't going to persuade folks otherwise.  And, in fact, we were celebrated after everything was over.  "Boy, you all really looked good sitting out there, blah, blah."  Sometimes it's better to be lucky than good.  We--and I think ultimately it was a right decision.  We later found out that, in fact, this brother had plagiarized.  And it put all of us at risk, 'cause we were at the point after that where they would expel all of us.  I'd had a face-to-face confrontation with my mother [Reba Garrett Watson] who told me, "I didn't send you over there to do this, and they're going to put you out."  And one of the professors said, "Well, look, this is a violation, but I'm going to show you what we got."  And, you know, literally, the runner had not just copied it verbatim.  It was the best of times, it was the worst of times; but he literally copied the author's name as well (laughs).  I said, "Man," I said, "this is an open and shut case.  Why you putting us through this"?  And he said, "Oh, man, F those white folks.  I think all of us ought to leave."  Well, he might have been right, but that wasn't his decision to make for all of us.  And so, we then went into a mode of damage repair, and we did actually participate and step up and kind of negotiate his expulsion for a year, where he could come back--he never did--and got the rest of us off for vigorous, though somewhat uninformed and misguided advocacy.
Story_ID: 92334
Speaker 1: And I think we made some good points, and the school grew from that and we did as well and we had a wonderful time.  We shut down the library.  We learned the various aspects and attributes of guerilla warfare.  It wasn't by then but about thirty or forty of us.  And wasn't but half of us really involved.  But it was--it's spring and getting ready for exams, one thing we knew we could do that would have an impact on the entire campus is we could shut down the library.  So what we did was we went in and we checked out books, as many as we could carry.  And then we went back and we checked out more books.  It didn't take them long to figure out that we were emptying the library.  We never would have gotten it completely empty, but what the school's reaction was and predictably was, well we need to shut down; we need to close the library 'cause they're going to take all the books out, and we'll lose--and so, they closed the library, which meant all the students had to leave.  And, of course, that wasn't a good thing to do during exams when you had students interested--so it was--we learned some lessons there that were good lessons to learn and it was a good time to learn them.
Story_ID: 92335
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, well, how did you--well, tell me about law school, now.  How did you get into Vanderbilt [Law School, Nashville, Tennessee]?  What happened?
Speaker 2: Well, I graduated with, again, as I said, a B-average, and applied to University of Memphis [Tennessee]; [University of] Notre Dame [Indiana], and I'll tell you about that; Vanderbilt, University of Tennessee.  I got waitlisted at the University of Memphis.  And I finally dropped Notre Dame; and the University of Tennessee, I don't know if I ever heard from them.  I probably didn't get--obviously didn't get accepted.  But Vanderbilt was the first to respond.  I had gone to the CLEO, Council on Legal Education Opportunity, a summer prep.  I had worked a year after graduating from college.  I went to work as a headhunter with a company called RLS (ph.) Associates out of Charleston, South Carolina.  They had come to Memphis, put on a employment fair, and they were looking for basically African-American talent to go into Fortune 500-type companies.  And, they had Xerox, American Can, IBM, etc.  A lot of folks here got jobs through that.  I went on several interviews, and they were going to place me; and, of course, they got a, as a recruiting firm, they got a share from the company of whoever they placed.  But the company had a philosophy of taking the top--taking the star out of a particular site into the company.  And so I was it for that deal in Memphis.  If they could get them.  If not, they placed them.  So they took me.  And I went to work as a headhunter putting on job fairs in various parts of the country in big cities, primarily.  They were stationed in Charleston, South Carolina.  It was a small operation.  And I was required to go to see--sixty days before I got there, we started running ads inviting resumes; thirty days I'd go there onsite, I'd start interviewing and selecting folks.  And then at the end, we'd bring the companies and set up interviews and place folks.  I went to probably about ten different cities working out of Charleston; lived in Charleston.  Beautiful city.  This is before Hugo.  It was the longest ten years that I've ever spent anywhere, and I was only there a year.  It was the loneliest ten years.  Charleston--I had one date, and that date was with the--actually, it wasn't a girlfriend of my boss.  It was a girlfriend of my boss's competitor's company.  And I remember going over this young lady's house and her parents asking, "Well, who are your parents"?  In Charleston, that was important, and unfortunately, I didn't have a Charleston history or bloodline that made me eligible.  So I was very lonely.
Story_ID: 93008
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'd been in Charleston [South Carolina] for a while, and I'd already had my one date.  And the social life was zilch.  The social life was so bad that one night I went to a--I was driving home and I saw this place, lights flashing.  And I went in this bar and the guy said--with this bar--guy said, "Well, we don't think you want to come in here."  And this is a white guy.  And I looked at him and I said, "I can go anywhere I want."  And I walked in and there was guys dancing with guys and women dancing with women.  I said, "Well, I guess I'll go home."  So I turned around and went home.  He was right.  It wasn't the place for me.  It was not
Speaker 2: It wasn't about race.
Speaker 1: It wasn't about race (laughs).  It wasn't about race.  He was just giving me good advice.  But things were real bad in Charleston for me.  I was driving in to work the next day and bumper to bumper traffic and we were inching along, and I said, "Man, this is a rat race.  And I'm not ready for this.  I'm going to go to school."  And I applied to law school and business school, took the various tests.  I did well enough to get accepted into two very good schools; Washington University in B school [Business School], and Vanderbilt [University, Nashville, Tennessee] in law school; took the summer prep course through the CLEO [Council on Legal Education Opportunity] Program for law school and went to Vanderbilt.  It was closer to home.  It was back in Tennessee, which, according to my thought process, was where I would have the best opportunity to succeed, the best foundation to succeed.  I arrived there as a somewhat mature first-year student with one year of real-life work experience.  And, again, it was Noah's Ark; six black guys, six black females.  And I guess I was riding in some respects an Affirmation Action bubble, which saw these institutions at just about the time I arrived make more aggressive efforts to bring folk in.  We graduated, again, out of undergrad.  We graduated everybody that came in with us.  And out of law school, we lost only one.  Another young lady transferred to another school and graduated, but we--everybody came in, we got out.

Speaker 1: But I went to law school [Vanderbilt Law School, Nashville, Tennessee] and it was a rigorous academic environment.  And, then, again, my usual, what I call, distracted B.  This time it was B minus I would guess to be quite honest with--it was a good environment.  Two things:  we always made a difference.  In undergrad school [Rhodes College, Memphis, Tennessee], I like to say that we brought the first black studies and the first African-American professor to my undergrad school.  They hadn't had one.  I went out and found one over at LeMoyne College here in Memphis [Tennessee]; an African-American, Clarence Christian (ph).  He taught African American history.  We brought him in and basically taught the course.  I had a history professor that worked with me on that, bought into the idea, and he actually taught a course for a semester.  In law school, we did the same thing.  We didn't go out and find the person, but we encouraged the law school to find an African-American professor, and he brought in--he's still there now; Robert Belton, who taught Civil Rights and Civil Rights History and Law course there.  He came in, I believe, my second year, and it's--and I like to tell him as well, that I brought--I really didn't--but I did--we did encourage it as part of the Black Law Students Association [BLSA], which we, again, established at Vanderbilt University School of Law.  And, unlike undergrad, I was never able to get elected the president of the Law Students Association.  I, for some reason, kept losing out to a taller, green-eyed, lighter complexion, good-looking guy that had a block vote of the sisters (laughs).  So he just outvoted me.  He's a good friend of mine still, but I told him if he wasn't--if he hadn't been taller than me, I would have been president.  At any rate, we had, again, an opportunity to get involved in academic litigation for a violation.  My roommate in law school took a newspaper.  Fellow went up and put coins in a newspaper rack, got a paper out, and my roommate said, "Hey, wait a minute."  And reached in and got one out.  And it was a--became an honor violation.  And they were going to put him out of school for that.  And, of course, we're in law school and we're learning to be lawyers; so it became a much discussed "trial."  We ultimately got him nominal, but appropriate, discipline for what was a nominal violation and thought they were overreacting.  A lot of things, but academic death penalty for then, a twenty-five cent newspaper, seemed a little bit extreme.  And they had made their point.  At any rate, we made some contributions to the academic environment, and now there are a number--a greater number, and at times as many as five or six African-American professors on the Vanderbilt Law School faculty.

Speaker 1: So when did you graduate from law school?
Speaker 2: I graduated from law school [Vanderbilt Law School, Nashville, Tennessee] in 1977.  And I didn't know what I was going to do or really.  A lot of my friends, who were at the very, very top of the class or near it, would get jobs during the summer working in law firms or clerking for judges; I sold paint at Sears and Roebuck [Sears, Roebuck and Company].  I mean, a lot of folks in my family worked at Sears, and so it--but, they gave me contact with a lot of different folk.  Actually, I worked in hardware, but I was really good at selling paint.  And my first year--my second year, I worked with a firm here called Ratner and Sugarmon [Ratner, Sugarmon, Lucas, Willis and Caldwell].  It's an integrated firm.  One of my associates in school had turned me on to it.  It was an integrated firm specializing in Civil Rights litigation and primarily school desegregation litigation.  And I clerked there for the summer.  And after I graduated, I came back and went to work with that firm.  It was the first integrated firm in the city--integrated partnership.  It was the first--one of the first--one of four integrated firms that had been started with a grant from--I don't know if it's Ford Foundation.  One was in Arkansas; one was in North Carolina, the [HM Julius] Chambers Firm.  One was in Alabama, and I don't remember the name of it.  And one was in Memphis--Ratner, Sugarmon and Lucas.  John Walkins (ph) was the name of the Arkansas firm.  John Walkins.  Ours was the longest tenured, longest surviving firm.  I went to work with them in 1977 as a lawyer.  In--at the end of May after I had moved back to Memphis--graduated in May, moved back to Memphis and was studying for the bar, I took the bar exam in July, and in August I was sent to St. Louis [Missouri] to represent the firm in the St. Louis school desegregation case.  We did St. Louis; Benton Harbor, Michigan; Grand Rapids, Michigan; Wilmington, Delaware; obviously, Memphis and several others under the NAACP Legal Defense Fund as associating counsel.  We were the trial counsel.  I was a little bit concerned, though, in my first foray into the real practice, because while I had taken the bar, I had not yet been licensed, 'cause I hadn't gotten my bar results; hadn't gotten my license; hadn't been sworn in.  And there I am, kind of, I'm the hired gun from outside with two local counsels who were looking at me and saying, "Well, he's young, but he must be smart because he's from this NAACP-sponsored firm," and ran into--I don't know, John Ashcroft might have been the Attorney General for Missouri then.  And it was really the best of the defense bar defended these lawsuits.  And we were a ragtag, young, black, hippy firm, really good and really smart.  And we didn't win right away, but we ultimately won all of them in terms of making the case and, more importantly, getting the fees, which came even much later.  But we survived that first experience and were able to pull off at least the facade of looking and acting like a lawyer, even though we were not yet fully barred and licensed; got my results a couple of months later.
Story_ID: 93011
Speaker 1: And another interesting thing that happened during that time, another interesting case that we [Ratner, Sugarmon, Lucas, Willis and Caldwell] had was a lawsuit that the justice department had filed in conjunction with us against Memphis Light, Gas, and Water Division for discrimination in their hiring practice, particularly for women and African-Americans.  We were the lawyers on that suit.  In fact, I was--really, I was carrying the briefcases of the senior partners that came in to do the actual litigation and discovery.  And that was my first introduction to this building and, frankly, in many respects, to this company.  We ultimately prevailed in the suit.  The company entered into a settlement, a consent decree, which said it would hire folks based on merit; it wouldn't discriminate against African-Americans, women; that they would set targets for African-Americans and women to move out of--at that point, you're either housekeeping or grounds--to move into management positions.  And that consent decree or quote Affirmation Action plan stayed in place.  It was implemented on my watch as a lawyer, prosecuting the company, and it was extinguished on my watch as president; right about the time I became president--I think I was general counsel--as general counsel.  So I have over the course of time switched sides on the case. Notwithstanding the consent decree having been extinguished or declared met or fulfilled, we still operate with very aggressive, what we now call, diversity goals and agenda; and are proud to preside over perhaps the most--absolutely the most diverse management team and organization with the possible exception of the Virgin Islands, that I'm aware of, in the industry.  But it's kind of ironic that in a rather curious way, you know, I was the architect of my own success, even though not necessarily planned, it just fell into place that way.
Speaker 2: How did it--well, what are the steps leading to you, you know, achieving this position or coming to this position?
Speaker 1: I came--I practiced law and enjoyed it and had done well, had done fairly well and had no complaints.  And someone suggested to me that I should send a resume in--I guess this was about 1988 when they were--they posted an ad to hire a general counsel.  There were folks that were interested seeing an African-American general counsel; one, it would put an African-American at the management level.  I know that there were two vice presidents that were then at that level.  But it was--there was an interest in--and so I was encouraged.  I sent a resume in.  And the resume resulted in an interview, and I said, "Well, I'm really not interested, but I'll go over and talk with them."  And I did.  And it was one of those times that I felt comfortable in being just completely open and candid.  In fact, I think I was trying to dissuade them from even being interested.  So I didn't hold anything back, didn't pull any punches, and then basically told them here's how I was introduced to the company, blah--here's what I think was wrong then, here's where I--I was just pretty on and aggressive in terms of explaining and presenting the information.  And I got another interview and another.  And I remember telling my wife [Brenda Partee Morris], "I think I'm in trouble."  I think--because each interview was with another rung up.  I said, "I think they're really thinking about hiring me.  They want me to come in and have a meeting with the CEO and the board."  It was in this very office, and I did.  And I--it was my one big chance, and I did the--it was a real, kind of strange interview; reminded me of another one I'd had some years early out.  I'll share that with you in a minute.  But I came in and I interviewed with the president and the board, and they said, "Thank you."
Story_ID: 93012
Speaker 1: One of the things that I did, and this is years ago.  I was younger, I was better looking, had a full head of hair and a full beard almost as nice as yours.  And I sat out here with a young lady who was blond, blue-eyed, mature, attractive; and we just struck up a conversation.  And I did about just anything, everything.  That's probably what got me hired.  But we had rapport.  At any rate, they brought me back, and the president invited me to lunch about a week or so later and he offered me the job.  And that was the moment of truth, 'cause I really didn't want the job.  I was hoping over the process that they would decide they didn't want me in the job, but he offered me the job, and I said, "Well, Larry," that was his name, "I'm really honored.  But I think I'm just going to have to say no."  And he said, "Well, why?"  And I really didn't--it didn't work to say, "Well, I really didn't want the job anyway," this far down the road (laughs).  I said, "Well, I thought about it and I'm just going to have to say no."  And so that was the end of it as far as I thought and was concerned.  Well, I got--started getting pressure and calls which culminated--and I'm in court and the judge, African-American judge, said, "We're going to take a brief recess.  Will counsel approach."  And I went up, and he said, "Come back to my chambers."  I went back to the chambers.  He said, "What the hell are you doing?  I heard you turned down that job down at MLGW [Memphis Light, Gas, and Water]."  And I said, "Well, yeah, you know.  I'm enjoying what I'm doing and practice--my practice is going well, blah, blah, blah, blah this."  And he said, "If you weren't interested in the damn job, you never should have applied in the first place.  All you've done is you kept some other brother from getting that opportunity.  You know if you don't take it, the next--the person--you're only saying to them that they can hire the next person."  The other person was me--besides me was a white guy, who by the way is my general counsel now.  He was persistent and he stuck around.  And I said, "Yeah."  And he made it clear to me that it was, in his view, a right thing for me to do.  And I was having some guilt thoughts about that as well.  But he also made it clear to me that he was going to be very disappointed if I didn't take it and that--well, you don't want a disappoint a judge--you don't want to be in a disappointed judge's court as much as I'm in court, I thought.  And so--and it was a right thing.  So they called back and I said, "Well, really, I'm making more money than that now."  And to make a long story short, they agreed to raise the compensation and, in fact, they did, and so I accepted the job. I came into an environment that was interesting, because one, I was from off the street, which is unusual for this company [Memphis Light, Gas, and Water]; two, I was a little bit more aggressive and independent in spirit; and three, I was making more money than everybody in the company but the president, which was my ideal.  And I didn't realize at the time that the only reason I wasn't making more than the president was because statutorily I can't.  But there was a pushback and kind of an informal resentment of that from folks who had been here twenty years, had worked their up the ranks.  And so here I come in.  I'm young and I'm black and I'm making more money.  And probably some felt I really hadn't earned it or didn't deserve it.  I felt I'd taken a pay cut to come.  So there was bitterness and disappointment on both sides.  Well, ultimately, I became their best friend 'cause everybody got a raise after that. Albeit we did maintain the philosophy that I was going to be the second highest paid, second to the president, and still--well, and did up until the time that I became president.
Story_ID: 93013
Speaker 1: When I became president, it was--well, when I became--let me do this, if I might go back to the best interview I ever had.  I was in law school, and when these big law firms would come to the law school to interview, they'd want to interview with the top person in the class; top ten percent.  I wasn't in the top ten percent.  And they would only take the Law Review, and I didn't do Law Review.  But they would schedule interviews, and I'd get on the list, and it was kind of a perfunctory.  We talked to, I've said, just one African-American guy.  They--it made their list look good.  And then maybe they'll hire someone every once in a while.  But I went into this interview with the firm, still prominent firm, from Baker and Botts [Baker Botts] from Texas, and a guy came in and we're in the interview room and he sat down and he did the usual introductions.  I did--I said, "Look, we got fifteen minutes."  I said, "I'm not in the top ten percent."  I said, "I'm black and I'm not on Law Review."  I said, "Now, you're probably going to spend fifteen minutes talking with me about your firm and all of that, knowing full well that you're not going to bring me down to Dallas [Texas] as a summer intern, a clerk, and I'm going to spend fifteen minutes talking with you as if I really think you're going to hire me."  I said, "Why don't we just close our notebooks and talk about football or baseball or what you plan to do this summer instead of spending that time (laughs).  The guy looked at me and he said, "It was the highest compliment that I've ever gotten in an interview."  He said, "You know, I appreciate that, and you're just the kind of person that we would want to hire."  I said, "Yeah, but you're not going to hire me". (Laughs.)  "No," he said, "but we can talk about the Cowboys."  (Laughs.)  And so we talked football for the remaining ten minutes.  Best interview that I'd ever had.  The guy, every once in a while I'll see him and we'll--after that I would see him.  We'd bump into each other and kind of chuckle about it and laugh about it.  Basically a good guy, but no sense in us, you know, pulling each other's leg.
Story_ID: 93014
Speaker 1: When I came into the position here [Memphis Light, Gas and Water] as president, I really didn't have an interview per se for the job.  It's a quote political appointment.  And, quite frankly, I really didn't campaign for the job.  To me it was sort of like quarterback in junior high school.  I knew I was the guy for the job, just like I knew I was the guy for the position way back when.  But I wasn't going to actively campaign.  The mayor--it was a new mayor--and, in fact, previously I had been offered a promotion and had--to COO.  But when the guy that hired me retired, but I turned that down.  I said, Well, I could be a senior vice president or I could be a general counsel.  To my way of thinking, I was still very much a lawyer.  General was much bigger than vice president.  But, at any rate--and I'd only been with the company for two or three years then; but, at any rate, when I came into this role, there were several here who mounting tremendous campaigns for the job.  But I knew that I was the best person for this company at that time.  I was kind of like my friend in college who was the decathlete.  Great athlete, but he never finished first in anything.  He always finished second and third in everything.  And at the end of the day, had more points than everybody.  On the staff, I was probably, in terms of independent--culturally independent from the company culture--as the newest member of the executive team, I was the most independent.  So if you wanted to make a change in the company, I was the guy.  But in addition to that, I was probably the most active, engaged, involved, best known outside of the company and would be view as an acceptable or a reasonable successor.  And within the company, I was frankly better than going outside and finding somebody they didn't know. But there was a major campaign.  I didn't realize it at the time how much campaigning was going on. I simply said, "If you need me to do it, I'll do it for you," to the mayor. I said, "I'm interested, but I'm not going to bug you about it or campaign.  He appointed me as the interim president, and said he was going to do a national search.  And six months later the media--local media and the communities started pressing on, "Well, when are you going to do your national search?  And why, you know, things seem to be going pretty well, why do you need to do it?  You know, Morris seems to have everything under control.  Why do you need to do a search at all?"  So it enjoyed community acceptance and the mayor decided that he would then appoint me as the permanent--well, not permanent--it's five-year term CEO, which he did.  There was never any doubt in my mind that I could do the job or that I was the right person for the job.  I didn't realize how tough the job was (laughs) when I had--didn't have that job.  But as between what needed to happen, what needed to be done, the changes that needed to be made and where the company could go, there was never any doubt in my mind that I was the person among the folks that I saw here that could do best what others might be able to do all right or well.  That was my perspective and view.  And, quite frankly, it's a better company.  It's a much better company since we've instilled some--since we have modified it--modified and molded the culture into one that is more consistent with my philosophies and beliefs.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 93015
Speaker 1: I just want to ask you about religion.  You haven't mentioned this, and this being the Bible Belt, it seems strange that it hasn't been raised heretofore, so.
Speaker 2: Well, I grew up in church.  I used to--we used to go to church in Mississippi at Ball Hill [Missionary] Baptist Church--Reverend Ike Moore, who was kind of an uncle or a cousin--in Mississippi.  And again, the church was on a plot of land that my great-great-grandmother had given to them for the church.  The church was built by my grandfather.
Speaker 1: The church and school were associated?
Speaker 2: Well, they weren't.  They weren't, as a matter of fact.  The church was better constructed.  In fact, it was--my grandfather was a carpenter and brick mason and was a deacon in the church.  And we would get up on Sunday morning, we'd take a bath in an old number ten, corrugated tin tub with about--my grandmother literally would put water in there with an eye drop.  Well, actually, it was a teapot, but she could--I don't know how you can bath out about half an inch of water, but we figured out how to work that miracle (laughs).  And we'd take our weekly bath, and we would (laughs) then put on our Sunday clothes; my white shirt and a pair of black pants and shoes, because it was Sunday.  We would put two chairs in the back of the truck.  My grandparents would get in the truck, and we would drive down about five miles of dusty road to church.  I always wondered why we took a bath to get in the back of a truck, 'cause by the time we got there, we were literally covered in dust.  But that was the ritual.  And my grandmother played the piano at church, not that well, and it didn't matter what the song was, she always played the same tune (laughs).  And my grandfather was a deacon, and he would often pray at church.  And these were excruciatingly long prayers, and I just couldn't keep my eyes shut that long and I'd--sometimes I'd peek.  But anyway, but I was introduced to and grew up in church.  And, of course, when I moved to--back to Memphis [Tennessee] and with my parents, I joined and was baptized probably at the age of nine.  I remember it vividly because my sister and I went together.  We were baptized together.  My sister, I kind of held onto her coat--skirt tails most of my life.  And I am still a member of that same church.  Now, I left for a while and went away to college and went away to school; but I'm now a deacon at that church, and I'm really proud of that.  But my philosophy in part, because of my experiences in college where I met a lot of different people that were friends who had a lot of different life experiences and belief systems, and because of my training in law, I kind of respect a dichotomy in terms of my belief system and religion.  I don't proselytize.  I don't preach, at least not about religion.  And I try to be open and respectful.  Occasionally when I was general counsel, I had to enforce and help others, because there are lot of--there's a large population of Christian-believing folks at the company, perhaps as it should be--I mean, in light where it is and geographically, and that is the dominant belief system here.  But sometimes we have to help that group appreciate that there are folks from the Mid-East.  There Hindu and Muslim, and folks from China and Japan.  They have different belief systems that are entitled to respect.  And occasionally--we've evolved from saying "You cannot pray.  If you're inclined to do so," to saying that, "You must be respectful and remember we're a government entity and we can't promote."  So most will now accept that, within parameters, will act in a respectful manner.  And that's just kind of--it's not just a professional or legal--and as a leader of this organization, I've got to exemplify, but it's not just that.  I want my kids to be well grounded in their religious belief system, but I want them to be respectful of what other systems or beliefs there might be out there.  And so I don't--you won't hear a lot of that from me.
Story_ID: 93016
Speaker 1: Now, you said--now, I read in a magazine article that you said you had two personal guiding philosophies:  One being hard work, and the other being the growth of the organization and individual.
Speaker 2: Well--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Can we talk about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Actually, there's a four-prong philosophy or platform that I have promoted--that I've learn.  Some of it I'd heard it from my father [Herman Morris], who, again, got up every day and went to work.  Didn't matter how drunk he was on Friday or Saturday.  On Monday, he got up on time, got to the bus on time, got to work on time.  Rain or shine.  I believe in hard work.  I believe in good work; doing it right, doing it well.  But I believe in applying yourself and doing it as well as you can.  That's philosophy number one.  Number two is growth; continuous growth for the individual, the organization.  That means education, development, experientially, etcetera.  I believe and I promote that and I require it.  And the other is have fun.  It ought not be drudgery.  We ought to find ways to make it pleasant and enjoyable.  And it can be and it will be if we try.  And the other is to give back to the community.  Those are my fundamental philosophies that I brought into this job in this role in this context that I, frankly, had.  And they were the philosophies for the department that I ran before I became president, and they were philosophies for the firm that I was associated with and ran before I became an employee of this company.  I think it's important for a number of reasons, but particularly in this company, because we have evolved from an "Old Boy" system, where you were hired and this was an interesting place way back when.  You were hired because of who you knew.  And I'm told in terms of legend and lore, who you were willing to get to know; in particularly if you were a woman.  We have dismantled that.  And put in what is a--as close as we can come to a meritocracy in hiring and promotion based on qualifications and ability to contribute to the success.  If we're going to have that kind of philosophy, we need to have an approach that says that, first of all, we do good work.  And if you can't do good work, then we're not going to keep you around.  You're not going--if you're not contributing to the effort to the success, we're not going to carry you.  Everybody has a responsibility to do good work and do their share and do their part.  But also, everybody has a responsibility to grow and get better, and you better do that if you want to matriculate and grow in the organization.  That's a change of culture and philosophy.  It wasn't started.  Well, it kind of was.  It, in terms of the lawsuit that led to ultimately those kinds of things being put in place, but it certainly is being carried through and perpetuated by me.  And I think because of my history with the company, I've got a clearer understanding of the whys of that.  The thing that I have noticed and observed is that, there is a continuous--it's like racism; that old system will creep back in.  It's like weeds in a garden if you leave it unattended.  You've got to actively find it out and ferret it out.  You can't say, "Well, we've done it, and now we can walk away."  It's like gravity.  It's there, and unless you've got some operative force, lift or thrust, you're not flying; you're falling. And so you've got to continue to work to offset those kinds of widespread, ubiquitous forces.  And so we continue to do that.  We continue to insist that our employees do good work and are legitimately assessed, measured, and evaluated based on their efforts and the results they achieve; that they continue to grow, and we make it possible for growth, but we expect you to take advantage of things we make possible; and frankly, that we give back to the community, because that's good for them.  They benefit from it as well, but also, it's good for us 'cause we need the community to really appreciate 'cause those are our--and those are the philosophies.  And there're a myriad of reasons why I believe those are good philosophies, in particular for this particular organization that I lead.
Story_ID: 93017
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, there was a--I was reading about gas prices in 2001.
Speaker 2: Mmhm.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us about that and how you handled that?
Speaker 2: It was a nationwide and not worldwide crisis in that the natural gas prices in the winter of 2001 shot through the roof.  Part of it was a little bit of the gaming that the Enrons and the big investor-owned utilities had imposed.  And we're still just learning about that.  And part of it was weather.  It was very cold.  Supply, there was a limited amount of gas, a finite amount of gas available.  And demand, since it was very cold, folks were turning their thermostats up, not just in Memphis [Tennessee], but all over the country we were consuming it like it was literally water.  Our customers' bills doubled and tripled.  One thing you learn in this business is when customers' bills go up, they get upset.  When they double, they get really angry.  When they triple, they're ready to tar and feather somebody.  We saw that coming.  The industry kind of saw it coming.  I participated with national organizations, and we saw it coming, we were slow to act as an industry.  We acted a little more aggressively in this community in two respects:  One, we tried to lessen the pain by passing through a quick and temporary rate reduction to take some of the edge off of it; and two, we decided to roll out an aggressive "take control of your life and conserve effort" to address what I saw as the core issue.  And the issue was, if I'm a customer, my cost of comfort just went up and there's nothing I can do about it.  I'm helpless.  And we wanted to give them, if nothing else, a way that they could take control and that they could demonstrate that they were not helpless.  They could help the situation.  And so, it was as much psychology as strategic, but I think that's really what turned the tide.  We basically said to them, "We're going to get through this.  We're going to have help each other.  And oh, by the way, you're going to have to help yourself, and this is what you can do."  In trying to give them the tools--and frankly, in terms of the rate reduction--and this is what we've done to give you kind of a running start.  It was a thoughtful approach, as thoughtful as we could make it.  It was sensitive.  Now when I announced it at this national meeting that we were going to cut a temporary rate reduction, I literally got laughed out of the room.  But these were (unclear) that weren't going to do a rate reduction until it was imposed upon them by their public service commissions.  We knew we were going to end up there.  We were either going to take those loses and reduce rates or increase write-offs.  But, it was politically and proprietarily more proficient for us to put it out on the table first as our demonstration of taking control of this issue, even in our community, and as an example of that we can do it, that I think helped us to turn the tide.
Story_ID: 93018
Speaker 1: Okay.  Like, you also--you serve on something called the National Petroleum Council, appointed by the Secretary of Energy [Bill Richardson].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, tell us about that.  That sounds like an important position; and then, especially in these days of war over, you know--it seems to be oil.
Speaker 2: It is.  The National Petroleum Council is a think tank primarily of knowledgeable people in the industry.  As far as I know, I'm the first person from Memphis [Tennessee], African-American, otherwise to serve on this body.  And what it does, is it does special investigations research, and it advises the Secretary of Energy, and indirectly, the President.  Kind of a funny aside:  One of its former chairs, before he became vice president, was Dick Cheney.  When he was with Halliburton, he was the chairman of the National Petroleum Council.  Also, one of the participants was Ken Lay [Kenneth Lay] was a participant; what's his name, Bob Nye out of--I mean, it's--every big name in energy is probably on this group.  Point number one.  Point number two, it was funny to me when they were making a big deal out of the vice president's papers on energy policy, etcetera, and asking him who he talked with and what advice he had gotten.  That's one approach.  The other approach you could probably go to the National Petroleum Council and find just about every person they spoke with (laughs).  After all, the guy was the chairman of that body.  And in all probability, if you wanted to really know, if you just interviewed everybody that was on that council list, you'd have just about everybody he spoke with.  Unfortunately, you'd probably have myself as well, and we probably said hello or nodding hello to each other.  I didn't advise him on--but it was kind of funny to me when we were trying--when the courts were trying to figure out whether he had to release the names on the papers that he had received, I figured it's right over there (laughs).  It is an extremely significant and important policymaking body in terms of providing the intelligence upon which good policy is formulated and fermented.  It's an honor to participate with it.  It has worked on several issues.  It's working right now on natural gas.  And it thinks in increments of ten and twenty and thirty years ahead in terms of what ought be the appropriate policy; what kind of research; what are the practical implications of some of the decisions that are made.  It is not an administrative body.  It does report to the administration through the Secretary of Energy.  It's an advisory council.  We--in fact, this is the 27th of June--yesterday I was at the National Petroleum Council summit on natural gas, which was attended by the Secretary of Energy and a lot of the undersecretary staff from the Department of Energy, and several of the cabinet members.  As we looked at the issue, again, of natural gas and whether there's sufficient amounts to prevent a repeat of 2000--the winter of 2000, 2001, this year.  It's a tremendous honor, a tremendous responsibility, but it is an advisory body and think tank that will, from time to time, get tasked with specific items to review and to research, and to offer opinions to the administration through the Secretary of Energy.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there, in your position--I know that there's a model out called a solar machine.
Speaker 2: Mmhm.
Speaker 1: Windmills--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that generate--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: The spring engine.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Is there--do you think that, you know, that's really being considered in a serious way?  (unclear) or where does that--do you see that on the horizon someplace?
Speaker 2: I see some--it's a matter of technology and cost.  And the technology is going this way and the cost is coming this way, and at some point the lines cross, and at that point it becomes practical.  I think solar is still a little bit away.  But in some ways, applications are coming--it's becoming more and more practical.  And I think we'll see some developments on that front.  I think we're going to see us move away from as much in a more carbon-based energy sources because of the impact on the environment.  I don't think we're going to, in our lifetimes, barring some extraordinary quantum leap forward in technology, see us being able to break away from it entirely.  We're probably going to see more prudent and safer use of nuclear energy sources.  We're probably going to see some technologically advanced that will make dealing with the byproduct of some of the current energy sources, including nuclear and carbon, more tolerable or acceptable.  So I think, basically, all of those things are possible.  I think, perhaps, in short term, you're going to see, for example, more convergence or hybrid cars that have onboard recharging batteries as well as some kind of clean-burning fuel as a way of extending the performance and production experience on cars.  So you're going to see those kinds of things.  I think technology costs will come down, and technology innovations will come up, and those lines will converge or cross and then we'll see a lot of movement.  But until that happens, if it's too expensive or if the technology is too untested or inefficient, it's going to be a while yet.
Story_ID: 93020
Speaker 1: All right. Are there any in terms of the energy policy and poor people?  Or do you have any thoughts on that?  Any concerns about the energy policy and the costs of, you know, to enforce, especially black people, in a city like Memphis [Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: We are extremely aggressive.  I--last year, there's a meeting each year of a conglomerate of organizations, basically to focus on energy needs and concerns of poor folk.  One of the primary vehicles that those concerns are addressed is through the Low Income Heating Assistance Program.  It's called LIHEAP.  We've been very aggressive in pursuing that; both in organizations that we're a part of, the American Gas Association, the American Public Power Association; as well as individual.  We've testified before Congress to support that.  And, in fact, it was discussed.  Yet, right now, there is about $1.8 billion allocated for LIHEAP that needs to be $3.4 billion at a minimum.  In this year's budget, we're working to try to see that happen.  Will administration do it?  Will the Congress pass it?  We don't know.  But those monies were the monies that are then made available through the States to help folks during the extreme months, the winter primarily, when bills can get high and they need assistance to pay bills.  The other thing that we do is, we promote aggressive conservation and prudent use and consumption.  And again, our philosophy is more, LIHEAP is necessary, we got to do it.  It's like giving someone a fish.  We're more of the let's teach them how to fish.  Let's teach them how to make their environments comfortable and more energy efficient.  Let's invest on that front so that they don't have to get to the LIHEAP pool to try to resolve their energy concerns and needs.  So we're operating more on that front.  We do a lot of innovative things.  A lot of them have been developed even on our watch that helped to address that issue in our community.  And, frankly, some of them have been adopted and expanded even in other parts of the country.  One of the programs that we've got called "Plus One," Congressman [Harold] Ford [Jr.] proposed in Congress last year for national application.  And we're kind of proud of that.  It's a program--there're probably similar ones in other parts of the country--but our model was the one that was proposed for national application to help folks, who were poor or black or minority or just in dire situations who need assistance with their comfort and energy costs.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 93021
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns in general for the black community?
Speaker 2: In general and in specific, we're still as a population, in many ways, in search of its soul and its place.  What I hope is that we'll see a generation that finds its soul in the core of this country and what's good about it and helps to drive that forward and will find its place in the various levels of leadership, but not just leadership, of responsibility.  And just to use as an example, we've done an awful lot of work here to promote and advance success among the African-American business community.  And there are literally folks who, through our contracting practices and policies, some of which is affirmation action, all which is necessary in my view, who are going to become and some who have become millionaires.  And they're able to employ.  They're able to build and redevelop parts of the community that are near and dear to the African-American people who live in this community.  But those same folks also need to accept and assume responsibility, not just for their businesses or their job, but for the community at large.  And what I see as a need and see as a hope is that we will, in fact, do that.  And to me it's kind of a transition from being the users to owners.  You know, we're not just here temporarily.  We're not just renting.  The house is ours.  The streets are ours.  The buildings are ours.  And, frankly, the people, you know, are ours.  And we need to assume and accept the responsibility.  It's not someone else's problem to solve.  It's not someone else's contribution to give to or to make.  It's ours as well.  And what I'm not seeing enough of and what I'm hopeful of is that we'll see that kind of "ownership attitude."  It's my responsibility.  And the pushback I've gotten as I've kind of evolved to this and rolled it out among my friends as well, I'm doing a lot, you know, at my church; and we're building the new sanctuary, and this and that.  And I think that's wonderful and that's great.  But there's a lot that goes on in the world the other six days a week, and it's not at your church.  And there's tremendous need out there, and it's not good enough to me to say that you've given at the church, because sometimes you've got to give on the street as well.  You've got to accept the responsibility, and part of that responsibility means it's going to cost you something and you got to be willing to pay some of that cost.  And that's kind of my hope, that we will accept not just the rewards of efforts of those who've gone before or the rewards of the efforts that we, ourselves, have made, we'll accept some of the responsibility and be willing to carry out their share of the responsibility.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Let me make one other observation.  It's kind of anecdotal.  You got a few minutes, and you'll probably talk with him.  A tremendous influence to me, besides my father and my grandfather, is my first boss Russell Sugarmon [HM] in the practice of law.  Probably the second most brilliant man that I--and, again, second to my father--and the most intellectually enlightened man that I ever encountered.  I encountered him at an early point in my legal career.  We ate lunch together for a good ten years every day.  And I kind of learned at his knee about life and politics and law, and he was a great mentor.
Story_ID: 92350
Speaker 1: Sir, what would you consider at this point as your legacy?
Speaker 2: In fact, and to be honest, I think that my greatest legacy is my kids.  I try to invest in them as much of what I have come to know and learned and gained in terms of knowledge and positive attributes and traits.  I don't know what they will accomplish.  I've got three kids:  Amanda, who is my oldest, is absolutely brilliant in everything she does.  I just need to make sure she's doing the right things.  And Patrick, my middle child, is a goal-achiever.  He sets a target, he hits the target.  Gee, I don't know what Geoffrey is going to be.  He's a very bright and a very determined kid, and in his own right.  I think they'll be the greatest gift that I will leave to the world.  I've got to do a good job of making sure that they're--they have the right base and foundation.  And my expectation is that they will, in their own, make a difference for our family, for our community and for our world.  My job is to try to put them in a position where they're not artificially limited or barred from being able to reach whatever their potential is, and to try to give them as much of a launching pad to achieve in that potential.  Beyond just my immediate children, I've got other families of children; kids that I have nurtured and known and raised from my early days as a coach and counselor during the summers in college to some of the kids that came behind me at law school.  I'm maintaining a relationship with kids that are entering and matriculating at my old college and school, and just trying to make sure that if we can leave a legacy of positive and achieving, young people will come and do the work that we started to finish or to do the work that we hope to get to and never could, or to do the things that we could not do, but hoped where we'd someday be able to.  I think that's the best legacy that we can leave as a generation.  Best legacy I can leave as a parent or as a responsible adult.
Story_ID: 92351
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now we failed to mention your being president of the Memphis NAACP, Boys and Girls Club activities, and all that.  But, sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, that's a good question.  There are lots of ways.  I think there are, like any person, there are a lot of dimensions to me.  One thing a friend of mine mentions from to time is that, "You must be the baddest person in Memphis [Tennessee]."  At one time I was president of the Memphis branch of the NAACP, the best branch in America; president of the Memphis Chamber of Commerce; and president of Memphis, Light, Gas and Water.  In their own, each one of those are very powerful positions, and it's more than one person can do, and certainly at the same time, it's something that I set out to do as much to make a point to myself and for other reasons that I think were positive for all of the organizations involved.  But it is a good place to start in terms of reflecting and remembering.  I think mostly I'd like to think folks would recall that I contributed and made a difference wherever I was, whatever I was doing; and that that difference was better.  And if you look at, for example, this operation, this organization, I think even detractors or folks that didn't agree with everything that was done, would say it's better.  I know that, 'cause they told me that.  If you looked at the Chamber, we changed its focus.  If you look at the NAACP, we made a big difference there and made a big difference for it, this Memphis Branch, at a critical time.  And, in fact, take credit for, through the Memphis Branch, saving the national organization.  We were innovative and critical on many occasions in working through some of the even more recent difficulties that that organization had.  We don't necessarily--we don't step forward and try to claim or take a lot of credit.  It's counterproductive if you've got other things yet that you want to accomplish.  But we'd like to be recalled from time to time as having been many places and made positive improvements and differences, but made a difference in all of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, thank you, sir.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
