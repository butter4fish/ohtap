Speaker 1: So let's start with some, what we call People magazine type questions.
Speaker 2: Okay
Speaker 1: What is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: You know I, I, I really do love southern cuisine.  You know, my mom [Lillian Eskridge Trotter] and dad [Lee Trotter, Sr.] they are both from Mississippi and they really--my mom could cook and bake, you know, so--
Speaker 1: What were the specialties?
Speaker 2: Oh well things like greens and fried chicken and stuff that will give you a heart attack but it was good.  Then things like German chocolate cake without the coconuts because I don't like coconuts but she put extra pecans in and coconuts for everybody else (laughter).
Speaker 1: What's your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue, I love blue it's a color that I like and have always been there.
Speaker 1: Time of year?
Speaker 2: Time of year you know I would answer that two ways.  One I like the fall in, particularly in the U.S. but as I began to travel internationally it has been almost every season for a different reason.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Yeah I do, we own a place in Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts] and we have--we call it Sandy Lane, we named it after the Sandy Lane in Barbados that we fell in love with.  But it's a place where all of our family congregates.  We have seven grandkids and they love being there, it's a perfect grandparent trap.  We don't have to ask them, they want to come.
Speaker 1: What part of the island is it in?
Speaker 2: We're in Vineyard Haven [Massachusetts] overlooking Vineyard Sound.  It's on three acres and on the water and we do all kinds of fun things there.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite saying or phrase?
Speaker 2: Oh a favorite saying really when I think about it would be--I'm an impatient individual and I have this sign on my desk that says God grant me patience and I want it right now.
Story_ID: 526466
Speaker 1: So I'd like to look at your family.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Let's start with your mother.  You tell me your mother's name, when and where she was born and tell me about her.
Speaker 2: Well my mom, she--her name is Lillian Doris Trotter [Lillian Eskridge Trotter] and her maiden name was Eskridge and she was born in Duck Hill, Mississippi a small place in Mississippi back around and I won't get this exactly right but around 1920.  They did the migration during, actually a two-step move from Mississippi to Nashville, Tennessee first and then Tennessee to Ohio a little bit later which is where I was born.
Speaker 1: And what do you know about her parents?
Speaker 2: Celia [Celia Govan Eskridge] and Lenzie Eskridge again they made the trek first north looking for jobs and then the rest of the family followed.  There were five brothers and five sisters and they all ended up in Cleveland, Ohio.
Speaker 1: So what did--before they left was it leaving Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Yes
Speaker 1: What did they do there?
Speaker 2: They were farmers, clearly cotton was king and they worked on a farm not their own farm but somebody else's.  They lived there not a great living but I think no one went hungry.
Speaker 1: Can you trace your mother's family back beyond them?
Speaker 2: No not really.  I know that they are from slavery but it's sort of vague and you know, I didn't know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) People didn't talk about that?
Speaker 2: No not a lot unfortunately.
Story_ID: 526467
Speaker 1: (Laughter) (Simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Did they talk at all about growing up in the South?
Speaker 1: Yeah they did, in fact I had several visits there to Mississippi visiting family and you know, it was a different kind of culture.  It, it clearly was, while slavery was long past dead there are certain nuances of you were second class, third class, fourth class citizens was alive and well.  That was one of the reasons they wanted to get out.  They wanted to figure out could there be a better life and when you think about the scheme of things, my grandparents, none of them finished high school.  In the case of my grandparents not even grade school.  They were in the fields much earlier than that and my mom [Lillian Eskridge Trotter] and dad [Lee Trotter, Sr.], ninth, tenth grade education at best.  So it was all about they wanted more for their kids and their family and valuing education and pushing us like crazy to get it, get that done.
Speaker 2: So they moved as so many other families were moving, did they talk at all about that flow of movement 'cause, you know, a lot of people were picking up their homes and traveling to places that they didn't know before?  Was--did they talk about what those dynamics were like among the neighbors?
Speaker 1: Yeah you know it was really how do we improve upon whatever the situation is today, for them and what they had heard was there was jobs up north and oh by the way particularly in the automotive industry they were hiring African Americans--black folks at that time and these were really, really good paying jobs.  So they thought they had a chance.  My dad and mom when they started the migration they stopped in Nashville, Tennessee as I said earlier.
Speaker 2: And what was there?
Speaker 1: Well they decided--my dad decided to be an entrepreneur for a hot minute.  He got a truck and delivered coal (laughter) kind of thing.  It worked to a point but my mom wanted to be with her family and they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'Cause they had gone further?
Speaker 1: Yeah and they, they migrated further north in Tennessee.  My brother [Lee Trotter, Jr.] who is two years older, he was born there and then with a newborn they then made the trek to Ohio in Cleveland [Ohio].
Story_ID: 526468
Speaker 1: Did they talk at all about discrimination while they were still in the South?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, and I don't think they put a name like that on it but they really clearly understood there were dos and don'ts about their status versus someone else's and I got exposed to it.  I remember when I was like eight years old we went to visit my [paternal] grandfather there.
Speaker 1: Where?
Speaker 2: In Mississippi--
Speaker 1: In Mississippi, okay.
Speaker 2: --all the way back to Mississippi.  His name was Pleasant Trotter, half Choctaw Indian [Native American] and we visited him and we were walking down this sidewalk in town which wasn't much of a town as you can imagine.  A wooden sidewalk at the time but it had rained and it was muddy and we're on the sidewalk and two white individuals not much older than us said you belong in the street.  I'm going like hell I'm not getting my shoes dirty.  My uncle comes running out of the store saying hey they're from the north, they don't understand and I'm going I'm still not getting in that mud (laughter).
Speaker 1: You were like eight years old.
Speaker 2: I was eight years old.  So that gave me a real lesson on the world was going to be different particularly in the South it hadn't changed that much.  I quickly assessed and my parents [Lillian Eskridge Trotter and Lee Trotter, Sr.] quickly assessed that boy, we better be careful (laughter) with you guys south because this isn't what you've been exposed to (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 526469
Speaker 1: You said your [paternal] grandfather [Pleasant Trotter] was half Choctaw Indian [Native American].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So tell me--who--tell me about his background?
Speaker 2: Well his background again he grew up during slavery time.  His mom was Indian; his father was African American and married five times.  I think he liked it but he died when he was like 114 years old.  So he had a long life, a long life.  You know that's--we have a history in our family of having long lives.  I didn't lose any of my grandparents until their mid-nineties and my mom [Lillian Eskridge Trotter] died at 94 and dad [Lee Trotter. Sr.] was 95, 96.  So we're around a lot but we got to know them not well.  I'd seen him maybe two or three times and we talked about what was going on but not in the sense of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you know, did you know his mother?
Speaker 2: No, I did not.
Speaker 1: Did you know any of the other Indians in the family?
Speaker 2: No very limited. That's one thing that I missed and our family history wasn't something that we talked about a lot.  We now try and recreate it in a sense but it's sketchy at best.
Speaker 1: And can you, can you actually trace them back to slavery?
Speaker 2: No we haven't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You just know the dates it must be.
Speaker 2: I just know the dates, yeah.
Story_ID: 526470
Speaker 1: And what about your father?  Tell me about your father.
Speaker 2: My dad Lee A. Trotter [Lee Trotter, Sr.], Lee Alfred Trotter, you know, a hard working guy, did a little [U.S.] military stint in the ear- mid-'40s [1940s] but he wasn't there long because war [World War II, WWII] was coming to an end and you hard working.  Like I said about a ninth grade education but managed to get a job at Fisher Body which was a General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company] plant at the time in Cleveland, Ohio and worked there for forty years.  So--
Speaker 1: What did he do?
Speaker 2: He was--started off on the assembly line throwing metal around and putting it in presses and then became a, I call it semi-skilled die setter where you put these dies in big punch presses and stuff like that.  So really did reasonably well and moving up but that was about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's a good job.
Speaker 2: Yeah it was a great job.  When you think about automotive benefits and automotive pay, so I can't say that we struggled from meal to meal that never happened.  My mom [Lillian Eskridge Trotter], she worked as well, she did day work, cleaned houses, babysat for people that kind of stuff.  But the three of us ultimately four because I have a sister [Lorraine Trotter Wrenn] that came along fifteen years younger than me, we considered ourselves blessed.
Speaker 1: And how did your parents meet?
Speaker 2: They were in this small town, it was hard not to meet (laughter).
Speaker 1: Where did they meet?
Speaker 2: In Mississippi
Speaker 1: Oh your parents met in Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Yeah they were born and raised there and met there, got married there. You know the whole nine yards.
Speaker 1: They moved together.
Speaker 2: They moved together as a team to Cleveland right.
Speaker 1: Okay and how old were they when they moved, do you know?
Speaker 2: I'd say well my brother [Lee Trotter, Jr.] is seventy-two, he was born in '43 [1943] so probably they got married in like 1940.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, right around that timeframe.
Speaker 1: So they were a young married couple?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: And they moved after he was born?
Speaker 2: That's it exactly.
Story_ID: 526471
Speaker 1: So when you think about where you grew up, 'cause you were born in Cleveland [Ohio], right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was born in Cleveland.
Speaker 1: What's your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Ooh, earliest childhood memory, we grew up in the inner city of Cleveland in the Quebec [Avenue], Quincy [Avenue] area and Bolton [Bolton Elementary School, Cleveland, Ohio] was the elementary school.  Everybody lived in these houses that we thought were big then but not so big (laughter) now that we're back.  In fact the street isn't nearly as long as I thought it was (laughter).  I can see from end to end but as a kid it was sort of wow and then school busses didn't pick you up, you walked to school but it wasn't five miles or one mile or anything like that, it was a neighborhood school.  So I'd say my earliest childhood memory would be the family and friends in the neighborhood and it was a neighborhood where everybody looked out for everybody and you know, you could get in trouble just as fast with a neighbor as you could with your mom [Lillian Eskridge Trotter] I mean, you know (laughter).
Story_ID: 526472
Speaker 1: So describe your home.
Speaker 2: Well we as most African Americans, or a lot of African Americans, very religious.  You knew you were going to Sunday- Sunday school and church every Sunday.
Speaker 1: What church did you go to?
Speaker 2: New Bethlehem [New Bethlehem Baptist Church, Cleveland, Ohio] at the time which was again an inner city church with great music though.  The Womack brothers were there, Bobby Womack and people like that growing up in there, so great music (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What denomination?
Speaker 2: Baptist because my dad [Lee Trotter, Sr.] was a deacon and then he became a head of the deacon board and then ultimately became a minister so you know, I'm son of a preacher kid and all preacher kids are bad (laughter).  I didn't let anybody down.
Story_ID: 526473
Speaker 1: (Laughter) (Simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was going to ask you what kind of kid were you?  What did bad look like for Lloyd [HistoryMaker Lloyd G. Trotter]?
Speaker 1: Very precocious, outspoken even when I should keep my mouth shut but that's when corporal punishment wasn't illegal (laughter).  So they worked on the building as my mom [Lillian Eskridge Trotter] would call it.
Speaker 2: They worked on the building.
Speaker 1: They worked on the building and my dad [Lee Trotter, Sr.]--I remember we would have--we sat down to dinner every night at six o'clock as a family.  We'd have conversations and challenges and we were always competitive.  If somebody said they could run faster than somebody we'd out in the yard right after dinner and clocking each other to figure out if you could or couldn't along with my dad and mom.  It was really that kind of family camaraderie but we'd have family meetings and talk about what was going on.  I remember this one somber family meeting when my father, who was chairman of the deacon board, came in and he said, "I am been called."  I'm going, "Called where?"  He said, "Called to the ministry and I will be having my trial sermon in probably a month and I am going to become a Baptist minister."  Without a beat--missing a beat, I said, "Just remember you were called, I haven't been called anywhere."  You could hear dead silence (laughter).
Speaker 2: How old were you?
Speaker 1: At the time about eleven years old and his response was you're right, you haven't been called but there are certain things you will do (laughter).
Story_ID: 526474
Speaker 1: What are the sights, sounds and smells that you remember as a child?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, let's start with sights.  The, the reality was a long trip was getting in the car and taking a trip maybe to the South and that was the first trip I remember and being outside in Cleveland [Ohio], which we didn't travel a lot, we didn't vacation a lot.  It was seeing things outside of Cleveland that fascinated me.  The sounds every once and a while we would drive to the West Side of Cleveland which was an international trip for me and we'd go to the airport and see a plane take off and I never at that point been on a plane and hearing the sound of it and wondering why does that stay in the air it's so heavy you know that kind of thing.  The smells were my mom's [Lillian Eskridge Trotter] kitchen (laughter) it was fascinating.
Speaker 1: Did you ever help her cook?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I loved to cook.  She used to tell me you better learn how to cook, sew, and take care of yourself because the way you're going, nobody else is, so you better do these things on your own.
Story_ID: 526475
Speaker 1: Tell me where you went to school.
Speaker 2: Started elementary school in Cleveland [Ohio], Bolton [Bolton Elementary School] and then we moved (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That was the walk that was close.
Speaker 2: That was close--
Speaker 1: Was this a black neighborhood, a black school?
Speaker 2: It was a black neighborhood, definitely a black neighborhood.  Some professionals in the neighborhood--that neighborhood but very few there were more blue collar working class kind of neighborhood.  Then we moved farther east to the Mount Pleasant [Cleveland, Ohio] area which was a bit more middle class changing neighborhood from Jewish to black and the walk was even shorter because we lived right across the street from my elementary school which was A.J. Rickoff [Andrew J. Rickoff Elementary School, Cleveland, Ohio] at the time.
Speaker 1: So when you were growing up from a very young age Cleveland had one of the largest percentages of African Americans certainly in your state.
Speaker 2: Well more importantly if you divided Cleveland between the West Side and the East Side very few blacks lived in the West Side of Cleveland.  So it was the East Side of Cleveland, remember--I don't know if you recall but Mayor Stokes became--Carl Stokes became one of the early African American mayors and it was the East Side of Cleveland that did that. Not necessarily--he got votes from the West Side but it was the East Side of Cleveland that pushed him over because it was 98 percent black.  Even though there were po- other ethnic pockets there like my high school was an example.  It was Polish and so on, it was fairly integrated, John Adams High School [Cleveland, Ohio].  Only 30 percent of the population in that school was black but it was just where it was situated in Cleveland.  Glenville [Glenville, High School, Cleveland, Ohio] and all of the other schools were probably 95 percent--Collinwood [Collinwood High School, Cleveland, Ohio], 95 percent black.  That particular school was in a changing neighborhood that had Italians, they had Slovenians and Polish folks and so on and we were clearly--
Speaker 1: Who were right in the same neighborhood with you at the same school.
Speaker 2: The way it worked was they didn't live next door to you.  There was a Polish section and there was an Italian section, Murray Hill [Cleveland, Ohio] was an example and so on.  They pro- kept their neighborhoods intact.
Speaker 1: And so what were the relationships like, was it that their neighborhood just like the black neighborhood was their neighborhood (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's it exactly.
Speaker 1: --or was there also any racial undertone.
Speaker 2: No there weren't gangs at that time and there wasn't any racial divide.  Maybe there were a few skirmishes in school but nothing big.  We played sports together, I played football, I wrestled and all of that other stuff but it was a very peaceful co-existence.
Story_ID: 526476
Speaker 1: You mentioned Carl Stokes--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --who became the mayor [of Cleveland, Ohio] much later.  So when you were a child it was Cele- Celebrezze [Anthony J. Celebrezze], was that his name?
Speaker 2: Celebrezze.
Speaker 1: Celebrezze and then Ralph Locher [Ralph S. Locher], is that it? And then Carl Stokes, right?
Speaker 2: Right
Speaker 1: So how did that evolve just in the city getting to Carl Stokes being mayor because that was historic?
Speaker 2: Right it was and I got to admit I don't know the evolution of how it took place but it was during a period where there was more black awareness in our culture and it was during a period where on the national scene the Martin Luther Kings [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] were emerging with voice and some power was seen as we've got to control our own politics, our own cities and stuff like that.  Because Carl became the first African American mayor almost in the country, it may have been one or two races going on at the same time, I don't remember that but I remember it was for a large city that was a big deal.  Then his brother Louis [HistoryMaker Louis Stokes] became a congressman for the state and again--for the state for the U.S. Congress and he was elected almost unopposed every time, kind of thing.  So there was a huge, huge awareness of who we were and what was going on and it was an awakening as well because I would have told you during that period of time that the same kind of racism and frustration didn't exist in the North as it did in the South as we watched some of the riots occurring.  Some of the more fierce riots occurred in the north, in Cleveland, Ohio in fact.  The rioting--
Speaker 1: And you were there then.
Speaker 2: I was there, I remember it very well I was eighteen years old when the riots in the inner city occurred and I lived in the proximity of it but not in the middle of it.
Story_ID: 526477
Speaker 1: Were your parents [Lillian Eskridge Trotter and Lee Trotter, Sr.] talking about what's going on in race relations (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah we did because there was an awareness that everything wasn't equal and I think a part of my big wake-up call was in high school [John Adams High School, Cleveland, Ohio].  While we felt that we were a part of the high school, you know, the reality was in every one of our classes we had never had African Americans hold any of the class president roles or secretary roles, we were only 30 percent of the class.  We got together as a group and said we're going to change that in our senior year because what was important to us in the senior year the president--the officers of the class picked the band that's going to be there and all that stuff and I don't do the polka that well (laughter) or don't do it at all to be honest and we said we were going to change that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you're saying there was power in having--
Speaker 2: Yeah there was power and what we did was we got together and decided that we're going elect one--nominate one African American for every office and then if they didn't at least nominate two or three, we would nominate them for them (laughter)--white candidates.  As it turned out after they took the votes we had an African American president, we had an African American vice president, we had an African American treasurer, we had an African American secretary.  Didn't know what hit them and when we started planning for the prom which the first time the principal came to us and said the white parents are saying they're going to boycott the prom because you guys chose a black band.  We said we didn't boycott when they were choosing and you weren't concerned about it either so why now kind of thing.  So it started with something just that profound a band and whatever.  So we talked to the band and they said we can throw some white members in there, we'll integrate it which is what they did and it was a great party (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you have a leadership role in the government?
Speaker 2: No I did not, I was just one of the supporters helping the plotting and you know I wasn't particularly a leader at that time.  In high school I was a part of the in crowd--in group but wasn't, didn't have aspirations to lead anything other than let's get this done kind of thing.  So I was a part of the planning and a part of the strategy and so on but not necessarily--I wasn't a leader by any stretch of the imagination.
Story_ID: 526478
Speaker 1: So as you're about to graduate from high school [John Adams High School, Cleveland, Ohio] did you think about going to college?
Speaker 2: Well yeah because you know, you didn't take a vote in my family.  I was told I was going to college which is a story in itself.  My brother [Lee Trotter, Jr.] had already gone to college--Kent State [Kent State University, Kent, Ohio] and ultimately a master's degree from Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  A younger sister [Lorraine Trotter Wrenn] was headed to college, we were all taking college preparatory courses and I was sitting at the table and I'd been accepted into three colleges: Bowling Green University [Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, Ohio], Kent State where my brother had gone and one other I forget where it was and said, "I don't think I want to go to college."  The answer was, "You're going to college" and I said, "Okay but here's the way it will work. I'm not dumb enough to fail out in the first year but I'm going to have the greatest party on your money for the first year." And he said, "But you have scholarships," I said, "I'm not going to take any of them.  I don't want to wrestle, I don't want to play football, I'm just gonna go."  He said, "Okay fine you're going."  Then he thought about it and he says, "I can make you go but I can't make you study so what are you going to do, what do you really want to do?"  I said there was this guy that came to our school I remember his name very vividly John Groogle [ph.] who--
Speaker 1: John?
Speaker 2: Groogle, G-R-O-O-G-L-E who worked for a company.  He was head of HR [human resources] for Cleveland Twist Drill Company [Cleveland, Ohio] they made cutting tools and they are putting a spiel together for four year journeyman apprenticeship programs for tool and die making and I think I want to do that.  He understood that because he was semi-skilled and he said, "Those are great jobs.  Okay if you get on that program I'll back off," and you know, I said, "Okay fine."  I remember there was several state setting things where I interviewed there at school, they said we want you to take a psychological test, I don't know what that has to do with anything other than they made me take it.  He invited me down for an interview at the manufacturing plant which was in the heart of the Hough [Cleveland, Ohio] area where the riots took place.  They employed two thousand employees and in the middle of a black neighborhood and I would be there first black employee if I got on this apprenticeship program, not a janitor, not anybody.  So you had to work hard in order to not have African Americans there when they could walk to work you know, kind of thing.  So I remember going to the guard shanty saying I'm here to interview, you couldn't even get into the waiting room.  That's the way they worked it and he said, "We don't have any jobs."  I said, "Whoa, wait a minute this guy John Groogle told me that I should be here for a ten o'clock interview."  He said, "Wait," and he picked up the phone and called and John came out apologizing, let him in, we've got to change this, that's part of our problem you know, kind of thing.  Long story short, I did get on the apprenticeship program.  Now what I didn't do my first day at work with my new squeaky khakis on and my work clothes on, John says, "Well Lloyd [HistoryMaker Lloyd G. Trotter] we have a program here that says you can either enroll in engineering school at Fenn College of business engineering [Fenn College; Cleveland State Univeristy Washkewicz College of Engineering, Cleveland, Ohio] or go to the community college and do technical course."  I said, "I don't want to go to school at all that was the whole point here," (laughter) you know.  He said, "Well you've got to understand you do six months--four years of six month different tasks but you also have to marry that with formal education at night and that's the apprenticeship program.  I didn't read that, hadn't read that fine print.  So it was like if you don't do the nights whether its technical school or engineering school which is the first year.  That's what's so fortuitous about it that we're allowing young folks to do this.  You can't have the job.  I said, "Okay."
Story_ID: 526479
Speaker 1: You were talking about that job [at Cleveland Twist Drill Company, Cleveland, Ohio] where clearly your father [Lee Trotter, Sr.] didn't have to do anything 'cause they got you.
Speaker 2: They got me.
Speaker 1: And so what did you choose to do, what night school did you choose?
Speaker 2: Well I said if I've got to go to college--go to school I might as well get some college credits.  So I did apply and got accepted at Fenn College business and engineering school [Fenn College, Cleveland, Ohio] which later became Cleveland State University [Cleveland, Ohio] that was the nucleus of Cleveland State University.  So I started out working with my hands and doing very technical stuff which I loved.  I love manufacturing--
Speaker 1: And did you learn that as a kid like with your dad how did you get to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We used to do all kinds of things around the house and stuff like that but it really was being exposed--because I never took any shop courses or whatever.  I was on the college prep track and that's when they had tracks; typical track and whatever which they need to get back to actually.  But it was, you know, getting there and working on stuff, learning the trades.  I enjoyed it, I really enjoyed it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What were you learning?
Speaker 2: I was learning how to repair equipment.  They built a lot of their own specialty equipment to make drills and reamers all kinds of cutting tools and stuff like that.  They make you also even though I was on the tool and die maker track, you spent six months with the electrical--electricians so I was wiring things and making sure that they worked electronically.  So it was a broad base kind of program.  For every six months you would (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You moved around the company.
Speaker 2: --you moved around the company so they broke it up in six months in about a thousand hours here, a thousand hours there and then back and just running a lathe and understanding how to run a lathe which later I got to really use in my background.  But--
Speaker 1: When you were in high school [John Adams High School, Cleveland, Ohio], were you good in math and science?
Speaker 2: Yeah I did the math and science stuff.  Even though I didn't like school, I knew better than to come home with bad grades (laughter).  I was more afraid of my parents [Lillian Eskridge Trotter and Lee Trotter, Sr.] than I was--they were on that like a hawk.  So it wasn't the math and science or whatever, you know, I knew I needed to do that track.  I didn't have a choice otherwise I probably would have opted out to do the technical track but that wasn't an option.  I'm glad it wasn't an option to be honest because about half through the program I knew I'd made a mistake and I'm too proud to say it and I'm a finisher, I'm not going to quit in the middle of something but--
Speaker 1: What was the mistake?
Speaker 2: I should have probably gone to school (laughter).
Speaker 1: Directly?
Speaker 2: Directly but you know it worked out because I got an education on people, on what it was like to be an hourly employee, not read about it and that bode well for me when I started managing hourly employees and understanding how they felt and what they could contribute.  But at the time it was, I made a mistake but I'm too proud to go back and tell my dad I did.  So I'm going to stick it out.  So it took me nine years to get a four year degree at night.  I never ever went full time.
Story_ID: 526480
Speaker 1: And how long did you work at tha- at that company?
Speaker 2: Cleveland Twist [Cleveland Twist Drill Company, Cleveland, Ohio]?
Speaker 1: Yeah
Speaker 2: For seven years from 1963, I graduated from the program, in '67 [1967] and they promoted me immediately to a product design and application engineer without a degree (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So that's unusual?
Speaker 2: It was a bit unusual and then I got into their (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What is the normal stepping stone?
Speaker 2: Normally you would just go Class A machinist or tool and die maker Class B, you know, Class B, Class A and move up on a blue collar track and they did have a track for that but I went into salary.  It was like two weeks after I graduated from the program they put me into that salary job and partly I think it was because there was two of us that were on the engineering--got into Fenn College [Cleveland State University, Cleveland, Ohio] and both of us were promoted two weeks after we finished the program.  So I did that for about a year and a half and then went into their technical sales track where I was supporting distributors who were selling our tool which is how I ran across GE [General Electric].
Speaker 1: So you had first been making the tools, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right
Speaker 1: And then you moved from making the tools--
Speaker 2: To designing the tools and then to selling the tools because a lot of the applications for tools are special applications.  They are not standard drills and reamers, we sell those too but they made more money on the specials or how it did specific things for their needs.
Speaker 1: So was it typical for a sales person to be someone who had come up through designing them?
Speaker 2: No, maybe design would be a track but not making them for sure and most of the individuals out there that were selling tools had college degrees.  You know, they did have a college background and I was out there and still in college because I didn't finish my college training until 1972.
Story_ID: 526481
Speaker 1: You start selling these tools that you have previously made and then designed and come across GE [General Electric]. Tell us about that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right. Well, what happened there was and I say selling but we were the technical support behind the distributors who had sales guys and one of our distributors had sold some tools to GE that made specialty equipment for making light bulbs.  We call them lamps because you can get more money in margin by changing the name of it.  But they sold light bulbs and they built this piece of equipment that was going to cut aluminum and it wasn't working and they were blaming it all on the tool.  I got a call from our distributor; I need some technical help here.  I went out and looked at it and I said, "Yeah the tools are not right for your application and I'll fix that for you but this is got to be your first chip cutting application that you've ever done."  They guy on the other end of the conversation was a GE employee and he said, "How would you know that?" And I said, "Well the tools aren't right that's for sure but your speeds and feeds the way you're holding the part, the coolant that you're using to cool down the part they are all wrong too," (laughter) you know, kind of thing. And he looked at me and he says, "You sound like you know what you're doing," and I said, "Well let me tell you about my background," and he said, "Well would you be willing to help us?"  I said, "I live down the street why don't every Monday we do a debrief and I'd tell you what I would do if in fact I was doing this application."  They probably accepted 90 percent of my ideas.
Speaker 1: And you volunteered to do this?
Speaker 2: Well it's part of the job, you know.  I want to sell more tools, I want my distributor to sell more tools and that was a part of the technical support for what you do.  So they then had a run off date, we had the new tools there and so on and it went really, really well and what I noticed is it was over a six month period at a time, you know.  So I noticed that there were a lot of more white suits and ties around for this run off than there was for the first one that failed.  The guy that I worked with for that six month period at a time, he says, "I want you to meet my bosses' boss," and I said, "I'm glad to meet you and I hope we didn't let you down, we really want more of your business.  The distributor here who ultimately is supporting you, he says they have a really great relationship so help us."  He says, "Well let me talk to you one on one."  He said, "Would you feel offended if I offered you a job?"  I said, "Yeah I would, I have a job.  If you're talking about a career I'd be willing to listen but I'm not out looking at all."  He said, "I meant a career," and I said, "Well, let me make sure you understand. I don't have a resume I can put something together and I don't have a college degree at this point and I'm not starting over."  He said, "Are you committed to getting a college degree?"  I said, "I am not for you or not for anybody else because that's what I know I need to do."  He said, "Well we want to talk to you about a career," and it was like I don't know three months later I got an offer and I was a GE employee as a field service engineer for their lighting division at Nela Park in Cleveland [Ohio] and that started my career.
Story_ID: 526482
Speaker 1: And as field service engineer [at General Electric], what was that job?
Speaker 2: They built again prototype equipment and the prototype equipment would be designed, built and then we'd put into one of their manufacturing plants and I'd show up to help them figure out how to operate it properly, how to get the most out of it, how to maintain it and stuff like that.
Speaker 1: So all of your technical skill that you had cultivated over time is what you're using?
Speaker 2: That's exactly right and that's what they bought into initially.
Speaker 1: How did you evolve in that role?
Speaker 2: Well I did that for a while and then I ran their advance manufacturing shop for a while.  I got a project to be the project lead on actually building a plant in Ravenna, Ohio and then another promotion that said we want you to go to Warren, Ohio which I thought was--I was going to die.  It was too far away from Cleveland [Ohio] and I had never traveled before and do some work there.
Speaker 1: So when you say build a plant, you were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A manufacturing plant from scratch.
Speaker 1: So what was your role?
Speaker 2: My role was the project manager to keep everything on track the construction, the layout of the factory, the installation of the equipment that would go into that factory and get them off and running.
Speaker 1: Why did they trust you to do that?
Speaker 2: That you'd have to ask them (laughter).  I did get it built on time and under budget but that you'd have to ask them.
Speaker 1: But you had worked in a number of plants at this point.
Speaker 2: I had worked with in a number of plants, a number of different scenarios and I was a guy that they believed you give him a project and he gets it done, no excuses kind of thing.
Speaker 1: And you understood what all the jobs were.
Speaker 2: I did understand most of the jobs that's for sure.  Now in fact one of the anecdotal stories was I had this model shop and these guys when you think about tool maker A, B and then a model maker, these guys could make anything without a pattern or whatever they're that good.  I had a group of those guys doing prototypes and so on and this one guy decided to challenge me and he said the factory is down they needed a left handed screw and I said, "Okay fine we'll make it."  I gave him the project and said, "We need to make this left handed screw for the factory so they can get back up and running," and he said, "I don't know how to do that."  I said, "Wait you're a model maker and you don't know how to do that?" And he says, "I'm a model maker and not only don't I know how to do it, I don't think a lot of the guys know how to do it."  I said, "Okay fine. Clean that lathe off and I'll come back out in a minute or two."  I went in and took my ring and my tie off and opened my shirt and anything that you wouldn't run a machine like that off.  I said, "Okay since your education has been sadly neglected everybody gather around and I'm going to teach you how to do a left handed threaded screw.  First of all the green button that's how you turn the lathe on."  I made it so ridiculous and then you then take--I went through the whole process and he afterwards--the guys had got to be comical they said, "Now what are you going to do?"  He says, "Why you didn't tell me you knew how to do it?" I said, "You didn't ask."  He said, "Well where did you learn that," and I said, "I'm a model maker as well.  I'm not asking you to do anything that I won't do and this will be the last time you try and pull this on me, right?"  He says, "You'll hear nothing more from me."
Speaker 1: So you knew he knew how to do it?
Speaker 2: I knew he knew how to do it.  Everybody there knows how to do it (laughter).  It was just again questioning authority and why are you here and how did you get the job and they had to lower the standards in order for you to be here when in fact he really didn't know my background.
Story_ID: 526483
Speaker 1: You started there [General Electric] in 1970.
Speaker 2: In 1970.
Speaker 1: And is this that same year?
Speaker 2: No this was '72 [1972].
Speaker 1: Okay and how many people of color were working there at this point?
Speaker 2: Me. (Laughter) I was there brightening up the--
Speaker 1: But you're in a leadership role?
Speaker 2: I was in a very low level leadership role at that point.  A first line supervisor let's call it.
Speaker 1: And they are challenging your authority?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: And after you showed them because you knew how to do it that shifted the relationship?
Speaker 2: It shifted the whole relationship and there were no other problems of any sort at that point in time.
Speaker 1: Where was this factory?
Speaker 2: This was in Ravenna, Ohio right outside of Cleveland [Ohio], close to Kent State University [Kent, Ohio] in fact.
Speaker 1: And you mentioned you took off your rings so you were already married when did you get married?
Speaker 2: I got married in '67 [1967].
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: In '67 [1967]
Speaker 1: Okay and after--shortly--so you graduate from Cleveland State [Cleveland State University, Cleveland, Ohio] in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In '63 [1963]--oh Cleveland State in '72 [1972], high school [John Adams High School, Cleveland, Ohio] '63 [1963], Cleveland State '72 [1972], married in '67 [1967].
Speaker 1: So then, how was your career progressing?
Speaker 2: From there? It was going well.  In fact shortly thereafter they had a problem and I remember this one because it was the first time I was exposed to internationally and they said, "Lloyd [HistoryMaker Lloyd G. Trotter] we need you to go to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to help us solve some problems.  We're sending a team and we want you on that team," and I said, "I'd love to go."  They said, "We want you on a plane Sunday," and I said, "Well I've got to slight problem, I don't have a passport, I haven't been on a plane in my life but I'm not afraid of that" (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What year is this?
Speaker 2: That would have been 1974, '75 [1975] and they said, "Okay we'll solve the passport problem.  You go to New York [New York] on Friday, hang out and get to the Brazilian embassy for your visa and passport and we're going to make this happen in forty-eight hours," which they did.  So I'm on the plane and I'm on my way to Brazil, get off in Rio and it was about an eight, nine hour flight something like that.  It was an eye opener for me because the porters there their eyes lit up when they saw me and came over, "Can we help you, can we help you?"  I said, "Well I'm with these other guys," who were higher level than I was and they said, "Oh we'll help them to but let's help you first."  It was just a change in the psyche of what I had been exposed to and experienced.  It was my first flight which happened to be an international flight and my first exposure to someplace other than the U.S.
Speaker 1: Well and the Brazilians really have a close affinity to blacks.
Speaker 2: They do, so I worked there for about a month and got a lot of things going for them and when I came back they said would you be willing to live there for a while.  I said I'm not sure of that but what we did was worked out a deal where I would go for three months, back home for a month and go for three months and I did that for two years.
Speaker 1: Because at this point you have small children, right?
Speaker 2: No not yet.  Well '74 [1974] was when my daughter [Tiffany Trotter Howard] was born.  Is that right?
Speaker 1: In '72 [1972].
Speaker 2: In '72 [1972]--my daughter was born in '74 [1974] so yeah I did have kids but they were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who were very young.
Speaker 2: Right very young and that was why I was concerned about moving.
Speaker 1: So it's interesting that you were able to make that deal because for a lot of people in Corporate America to grow in your career certainly then and I think still you had to be willing to move whenever they asked you.
Speaker 2: But this was a probably a unique situation at a unique time and they didn't hesitate in saying we want you there here's what we'll do and I said I can do that you know, kind of thing.  It was an easy read for me but I knew that I couldn't just move and go there without you know, some support back--a lifeline back.
Story_ID: 526484
Speaker 1: So you did that for how long?
Speaker 2: I did it for a couple years.
Speaker 1: And during that time so when--were you back in the states when Jack Welch takes over?
Speaker 2: Yeah because Jack started as CEO, I think around 1980ish.  You know that's about right--
Speaker 1: In '80 [1980], '81 [1981] yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah '80 [1980], '81 [1981] yeah sometime around there he became the CEO and I met Jack when I was with the appliance business in 1978.  I did a cameo presentation on robotics that's when I had left the lighting business and they moved me to the appliance business in Louisville, Kentucky.
Speaker 1: Okay so what business are you working at when you go to Brazil?
Speaker 2: Lighting.
Speaker 1: So you come back in lighting to Cleveland [Ohio].
Speaker 2: To Cleveland right.
Speaker 1: And then go from there--
Speaker 2: To power generation, I did a couple of years in power generation and then they moved me to appliances.
Speaker 1: And when you're moving around what role do you have then?
Speaker 2: Well when I was with lighting I ended up in the--they called it unit manager manufacturing in Warren, Ohio running a segment of the plant and then from there I moved from that to power generation where they made gas turbines and generating equipment up in Schenectady [New York] but they were opening the new plant in Greenville, South Carolina. A part of the project was for me to help, again project manage opening that plant.  I completed that assignment and that's when they moved me to appliances as the head of materials for the home laundry division which were subsequent promotions.
Speaker 1: So much like your first job, you're moving around GE [General Electric] learning all the different businesses (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Businesses and different jobs, different levels and more responsibility in all of them.
Story_ID: 526485
Speaker 1: What year are we in when you get to apply (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) When I went to appliances it was '78 [1978] I want to say and I left appliances and left the company [General Electric] in '81 [1981] '82 [1982].
Speaker 1: You left the company?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Where did you go?
Speaker 2: I went to Honeywell [Honeywell International, Inc.], down in Florida.  They are an avionics defense business.  What had happened was appliances is a tough business and I was put on a task force to figure out how to get a leaner structure for appliances across the whole appliance business which was a seven billion dollar business but I was in the home laundry portion of it.  To look at how we could lean up the structure, take layers out and drive more productivity in which we accomplished.  I did it with my own organization before anybody else did it and everybody knew I led that project.  Well there were five of us on the team, four of the individuals immediately got promoted two weeks after the assignment and there was huge success.  I was the one guy that didn't get promoted and at the time my manager called me and said, "We screwed up here.  Everybody and their brother know that you led the project and there was no promotion for you.  I have this job, it's yours but quite frankly I don't think it's the right next move for you."  I agreed it was a manager quality and I said, "I don't want to do that, I'll wait and bide my time." Well what happened a day later I got a call from a friend that was a mentor and said, "Honeywell's looking for people and they're saying they can't find African Americans who can do this kind of job and I know you can do it.  I know you're not going to take it, you're doing really well at GE but I want you to interview anyway."  I said, "I'll interview but I might surprise you."
Speaker 1: You were mad at this point.
Speaker 2: I was really, really mad at this point.
Speaker 1: Did you think this was racism?
Speaker 2: It was clearly a huge oversight and I do believe that my color had something to do with it but it never came out that way.
Speaker 1: At that point at GE, what is the racial mix?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, because of the hourly--if you included the hourly employees it probably looked like the communities at large but when you look at the management team it was a white male oriented not even female--white male oriented leadership team.  There were spots of African Americans doing better and I was one of those spots (laughter), you know, kind of thing.  Even where I was at that point in time which was still a fairly low level in the company I was probably in appliances one of the highest level executives there and there probably were no more than three of us.  Out of--appliance part--let me sort of frame it for you, employed twenty eight thousand people of which a third were probably in the leadership salary ranks and I was probably--there were more than me in the three but at that level managing people there were probably three of us and that was it.
Speaker 1: And your colleagues the four others who were part of that team were white males.
Speaker 2: All white males, right.
Speaker 1: At the same level as you?
Speaker 2: They were--they were at the same level at the time but when they got promoted they were higher level than me (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sure.
Speaker 2: --you know, and that's what I was seething about, you know, kind of thing.
Story_ID: 526486
Speaker 1: So you, you have the interview at Honeywell [Honeywell International, Inc.]. You take the job (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I took the job. And--which was a mistake by the way because it helped me with my development needs.  While I was going to stick it out and my boss who was VP [vice president] of manufacturing for all of appliances, he said, "I made a mistake and I'm catching hell from Fairfield [Connecticut]," which was headquarters, "And how could I let this happen when you're one of the stars we've been tracking."  He said, "But you told me you didn't want a counter," and I said, "I don't."  I said, "This is something I want to go do and the only reason I'm going to get a chance to do it is because of the experiences that GE [General Electric] gave me."  So he said, "But I'm going to come back after you."  Well it was like eight months to the day I got a call--
Speaker 1: Wait, what was the job at Honeywell first?
Speaker 2: It was leading their materials group in the avionics defense business but a bigger more complex job than the materials group I had at GE.
Speaker 1: And you had to move?
Speaker 2: Yeah to Florida, I moved to Tampa, Florida.  So that all happened for eight--ten months by the time we got the deal done but it was short. But it--I said that it taught me something. Number one, making the decision to move and making the decision on where to move to are two separate decision processes.  I made them both on the same day because it was in front of me, you know, and if I had thought about what I liked about a job and what I don't like about a job the avionic defense business is a slow moving business, bureaucratic because you have to get the government to bless off on everything you do even if you wanted to change a process that you could change in five minutes and it drove me nuts.  I knew I didn't belong there but it was a decision I had made and I knew it was a wrong decision but I felt I could build a career there because just like GE, Honeywell had many, many facets to it.  This is where you enter maybe I could get to something different down the road.  But when I got the call he said, "There are three jobs--great jobs with your name on it.  You can have any one of the three.  Are you ready to come back," and I said, "Yeah," (laughter) and I did.  So I was gone all of ten months and that's when I moved to Connecticut to the electrical distribution and controls.  It's Plainville, Connecticut right outside of Hartford [Connecticut].  It was the headquarters of that particular business.
Speaker 1: So as you're moving around just curious how logistically this works.  Do the companies move you and set you up and they already have housing or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No you'll have to find your housing but they support you a lot like if you owned a house in the old location they buy it if you couldn't sell it.  They would pay for closing costs on the new location.  They'd give you trips for your family to go look at the area and do the house hunting and all that other stuff.  So there was a fair (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 'Cause they want you focused on your job.
Speaker 2: --yeah they want you focused on go to work kind of thing.  So there was a fair amount of support and literally you wouldn't do it if you were contributing your income to do it every time.  Now there was a contribution factor but it was not that bad.  They really worked hard to make it a very comfortable situation for you.  I moved fourteen times in my GE career.
Speaker 1: Fourteen.  Wow.
Speaker 2: Yeah I moved a lot.
Story_ID: 526487
Speaker 1: When you moved back from Honeywell [Honeywell International, Inc.] what year is this?
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty-three [1983].
Speaker 1: In '83 [1983] and you moved to well to Connecticut.
Speaker 2: Connecticut.
Speaker 1: And what is your role again [at General Electric]?
Speaker 2: A manager of materials for the whole division which was global business.  It was about thirteen billion [dollars] in sales, so much larger.  I had warehousing distribution, purchasing and plant supports for the whole business, forty-three manufacturing plants.
Speaker 1: So this is a huge job?
Speaker 2: It was a big job and it was a huge job because this was my first executive band job.
Speaker 1: And in terms of being prepared do this big leap, what--was it just all the jobs you had before?  Did you feel at all like uh oh I'm swimming in deep waters?
Speaker 2: I honestly didn't feel threatened one bit (laughter).  I walked in there and it wasn't tough to follow the act that had been there before me at all.  I felt very comfortable about what I needed to do, where we needed to add new programs, where we needed to complete old programs and so on.  So it was not a stretch in my mind at all.  I was well prepared for that job.
Speaker 1: Was--were you moving into that position because the person had retired, was there an issue with that business?  Why was it--
Speaker 2: No the person had actually been promoted and was in another role over in marketing.  So it was that individual who moved on, there was a conscious decision.  We wanted to really hire somebody and my name was on the slate.  The hiring manager was an unlikely individual for me anyway.  He was a Kansas farmer and even when I walked into the interview I said okay--with a southern drawl but he became one of my biggest mentors ever.
Story_ID: 526488
Speaker 1: How many African American leaders are there now?  When you stepped into this role across GE [General Electric] are you seeing other African American leaders in positions?
Speaker 2: No. No, not yet but at that point in this business I was the only executive band African American and they employed roughly forty three thousand people in total but--
Speaker 1: In that business.
Speaker 2: In that business, just that business and there were a few that I knew across other businesses but the answer is there was still--you could count them on one hand or two hands across the business that it was employing.  At the time maybe 150,000 people in total.
Speaker 1: And were you at this point making a conscientious effort to identify black talent?
Speaker 2: No I can't say that I was. You know, I really can't.  I wanted to see other African Americans succeed but in some ways the system was stacked against you in that at that position when a job opened, HR [human resources] would give you a candidate slate and if the candidate slate wasn't diverse you picked from that slate, you know, kind of thing.  Things changed a lot later on but you didn't do it.  Now that said I probably could have done more than I did do at that point in time but it was more me mentoring and nurturing other African Americans so that they would be in a position to get a job like that as opposed to me saying I want to hire you or we're going to push you, you know that kind of thing, that came later.
Speaker 1: But, but--so at this point you're not doing--you're really building the business that you'd been given (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly.
Speaker 1: --which with what you--
Speaker 2: The tools that--
Speaker 1: With the tools that you have.
Speaker 2: That's it exactly.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 526489
Speaker 1: Now, at the same time--so this is in, this is the '80s [1980s]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Which is Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan]?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: How are Reagan and Reaganomics affecting GE [General Electric]?
Speaker 2: You know GE I'd say because of the diversity of their businesses and so on they weren't having a problem with Reaganomics.  Businesses tied to housing back in the '87-ish [1987] timeframe they went through a tough trough but GE was in diverse enough with its capital G- capital businesses, its high energy businesses.  Everybody needed energy and stuff like that and they made jet engines.  So they were all over the map.  They were sort of recession proof a little bit even though it would impact them.
Speaker 1: And so as GE is stacking up to other energy companies at that time was it the leader?
Speaker 2: Yes it was number one.
Speaker 1: Number one and who's trailing (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) If you recall Jack Welch when he became CEO he had these three circles he drew and he said you needed to be number one, number two in your business.  You had to have a growth profile that looked like and he drew some pictures around what that meant and if you weren't it was fix, close or sell.  So he literally started taking a hatchet to the company and anybody outside of the circle you either work your way back in the circle or you were going to be sold.
Speaker 1: And this was considered revolutionary.
Speaker 2: It was very revolutionary.
Speaker 1: How was he received in the early days?
Speaker 2: In the early days he wasn't revered as the world's greatest CEO, he was a train wreck (laughter) that's what they saw until things started really taking hold and then he was everybody's darling.  The stock was going up, the income was going up and he became the best CEO of the year for a few years running (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How long did the turnaround take?
Speaker 2: It was a good five, six years to re-create the portfolio, get out of some stuff and get into some stuff but he if you remember--one of the things he did during that reconstruction was he bought RCA [RCA Corporation] and that's what brought NBC [NBCUniversal, New York, New York] over.  He took the aerospace business [Smiths Aerospace; GE Aviation Systems] and then sold it to Lockheed Martin,  Martin Marietta [Martin Marietta Corporation] used to be a GE business, got out of the consumer products like TVs and small appliances, got out of them.  So it was a really reshape the portfolio, you know. And do- don't take a lot of time to do it.  You know, so it was a lot of moving parts.

Speaker 1: And as a leader in the company at this point, what was your interaction with Jack Welch?
Speaker 2: Well again at that point GE [General Electric] was so big--at that point very little interaction directly with him.  It was my next assignment where I became the general manager of manufacturing for the whole business.  I had all of the manufacturing plants, I had all of the sourcing and materials organization and so on where (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) When you say old business--
Speaker 2: Electrical, distribution and controls business, it was about 3.3 billion [dollars] in revenue.
Speaker 1: Because just for framework GE is so big it has lots of businesses (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was one of thirteen businesses.
Speaker 1: One of the thirteen which is its own multi-billion dollar business.
Speaker 2: All multi-billion dollar businesses (laughter) and I had the whole--all of the manufacturing of the business.  Another way I define manufacturing, I control 70 percent of the costs of that business if you looked at it on a cost basis.
Speaker 1: And what were you all making? What--
Speaker 2: We made--think about your home a circuit breaker in your home, we made those.  The panels, the breakers but then think about it broadly for controlling a utility plant they are huge.  Circuit breakers or interrupters or automation devices they connect all of the swats.  So we did the switches and everything for controlling power whether it's in your home or whether it was in a utility company or in an industrial factory or whatever.
Speaker 1: So as you're doing this how is the fluctuation of energy, and usage of energy, harvesting of energy globally affecting GE because it's a lot going on?
Speaker 2: There is and what was happening was it was moving from an electrical mechanical world to a digital world which had a lot to do with what we need to do to repurpose people and skills and careers and our products.  So there was a big transformation as the industry was growing up.  People didn't talk about load sharing and moving power from one grid to another grid and all of that kind of stuff but now today it's just commonplace.
Speaker 1: And for you because you started in the business very hands on--
Speaker 2: Right
Speaker 1: Physically making things and now it is computerized and digitized and for a lot of people that was a steep learning curve--
Speaker 2: It was a good learning curve for sure because at the end of the day no matter whether it is an electronic product or electrical mechanical product somebody had to put it together.  It looked different and the processes they used were different and it was me keeping touch with what is the contemporary way of doing that.  That's when I became general manager of manufacturing, it was I controlled 70 percent of your costs which says I better do it well and I got to get you productivity to pay for other things were the first thing a customer sees and the last thing a customer sees if I don't get it there on time and the quality isn't right.  It was thinking about all of these things that you had to put together as general manager of manufacturing.
Speaker 1: And are your plants at this point international or--
Speaker 2: Very international we had plants in Europe and it's in Brazil, plants in the U.S. with third largest employer in Puerto Rico had eleven manufacturing plants there.  So it was--I was traveling a lot all over the place.  I opened plants in China, Mexico so--
Speaker 1: And as raw energy costs fluctuate how does that affect the business?
Speaker 2: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You said 70 percent; you're responsible, you have to figure that out.
Speaker 2: Yeah you do and it affects us in a lot of different ways.  If the new products you're selling make the customer more productive, they are going to invest.  If it's more of the same, they're probably looking for a different solution.  So it was about the way--how much money would we have to invest in innovation that would make any business, it doesn't have to be a GE business, that keeps you alive.  So if you're not bringing out something new that gives me more value, I don't care what it costs I can't afford it because they have the same problems we have.  We want to get more profits to our shareholders, bill shareholder, equity, and they've got to do the same thing.  So how do you create this win-win proposition that allows you to do it?
Story_ID: 526491
Speaker 1: Who is i- in your ear giving you--
Speaker 2: Advice (laughter) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) advice about how to, how to manage this?
Speaker 2: Well guys that I used to work for they were doing it but a lot of it I was figuring it out on my own taking it to a different direction, different levels you know, kind of thing.  One of the early interactions that--I became general manager of manufacturing and we have this operating meeting every year--the Jack Welch meeting roughly 600 of the top executives and at that point I was in the club.  The first time I went was in 1989 and while I knew there wasn't going to be a lot of African Americans there, I was shocked that I was the only one there.
Speaker 1: The only one of 600?
Speaker 2: Yeah 660 individuals. You know, and I was the first one to be there and we did the meeting and Jack said something very profound from the stage, he said we do a lot of things right but I can look at this picture that I'm seeing and I can tell you what we're doing wrong.  This meeting is too white and too male-oriented and we're going to change that.
Speaker 1: He saw it and spoke.
Speaker 2: Yep and I wondered why my manager, he was CEO of the business, had said sit next to me in this meeting because he had done something nobody else in the meeting had done (laughter).  So it was a little bit of showcasing, I'm out front guys find your own.  But it was--
Speaker 1: That was in '89 [1989] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was in '89 [1989]. And literally in '89 [1989] the company [General Electric] while we had all gone to an EEO [equal employment opportunity] that didn't work and so on, it was a new awareness that we needed to level the playing field and we needed to do something different.
Story_ID: 526492
Speaker 1: Now the next year I went to that meeting I was on stage giving--part of the meeting is sharing best practices and in a meeting with Jack [Jack Welch] he said, "Lloyd [HistoryMaker Lloyd G. Trotter] I noticed that your productivity is two times everybody else's in the corporation [General Electric]. What are you guys doing, lying?" (Laughter) You know, that's Jack.  I said, "No, we're not lying it's hitting the ledger and we're doing all kinds of things," and he said, "Tell me how you're doing it." And I had developed this matrix, I had forty-three plants and when I traveled to these plants I saw nuggets of really greatness but not necessarily, they were not world-class plants.  And the whole dilemma was how do I transfer these best practices from one plant to another quickly which would only accelerate our growth and productivity as well as manage cash differently and so on. And I created this matrix that, it sort of benchmarked all of these plants with a set of rules that said if you're a five it means you're on your game and you're best in class.  If you're a zero you don't even understand what the practice is, nobody would rate themselves as zero, and they were rating themselves.  But if you're a three or below (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) If you're doing an honest job.
Speaker 1: Yeah well they didn't start that way but we got them to be honest real quick.  If you were a zero or a three or below, you seek out a five and he's going to coach you to where he is.  So it was self-help on how we taught each other how to get better.  Our productivity had traditionally been around 3 percent a year, it had jumped to 7.  Our inventory turns or cash management--we turned our inventories around five times and we had jumped to 9 over a relatively short period of time and Jack says, "You're on stage, you're going to teach the rest of the company how to do this."  And so it was this--I call it a best practice matrix, it's now called the Trotter Matrix.  If you Google it it's being used across the company but that's where it started.  About a year later--
Speaker 2: And you presented this, you had already developed it in 1990 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And I was using it. Right. And I was using it, so--
Speaker 2: So in the course of this one year where you've been running this part of the business, you had implemented it.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: You figured out what you needed to do, created it and implemented it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I figured out what I needed to do, created it blew it across the organization and it was delivering results.
Story_ID: 526493
Speaker 1: So you're, you're on stage talking to Jack Welch, but what's your behind closed doors relationship with Jack Welch?
Speaker 2: It was very good. I mean, you know, at the end of the day it was a very candid conversation.  I remember when I pitched a restructuring project [for General Electric] to Jack in Fairfield [Connecticut] it was a part of our review and I needed to close some plants, consolidate some plants but it was going to be 350 million dollar expenditure to get it done and he looked at me and said, "Lloyd [HistoryMaker Lloyd G. Trotter] that's a lot of money," and I said, "I know it's a lot of money. More than I have, that's for sure."  He said, "Well have you thought about doing this in phases?" And I said, "No, but let me think about it and I'll get back to you."  I was deflated that my brilliant idea didn't go across and he gave me the money.  Three pages into the pitch he said, "Lloyd tell me was that a good idea that I asked you to do or a bad idea?"  I said, "Jack, I got to be honest it's the worst idea I've heard in my life."
Speaker 1: Your idea.
Speaker 2: His idea. His idea about doing it in phases.  I said, "You're asking me to bleed a little bit all over the place and keep everything intact when in fact that's not the way the psyche of people work or the way you would implement something like this."  He said, "Well why did you say yes you'd think about it."  I said, "I just read in Fortune magazine that you're the world's greatest CEO so I ought to at least think about it before I come back and say it's the worst idea I ever saw."  He says, "Oh, forget that I'll get you the money."  But that was the kind of relationship we had.
Speaker 1: So he trusted you.
Speaker 2: He trusted me and he admired people who had strong convictions of what they needed to do and he would back them.
Story_ID: 526494
Speaker 1: You know, it was no different than when we started down--around the same time we started down the diversity track and it was a meeting something I didn't write him on.  Mike Shinn [Michael G. Shinn], he was in HR [human resources] in Cleveland [Ohio], wrote him a note and it was a Black Enterprise article about the five individuals who potentially could lead a Fortune 500 company.  At that point there were no African Americans leading Fortune 500 companies.  What he noticed that three of the five were ex GE [General Electric] employees and he wrote a note to Jack [Jack Welch] saying why is it that African Americans can succeed once they leave GE.  Jack rallied a group of people together and we called it workout, where--
Speaker 2: And exactly who were these people?
Speaker 1: Oh it was Ken Chenault [Kenneth Chenault] it was the ones--some of them made it (laughter).
Speaker 2: Who else? Do you remember?
Speaker 1: I re- I don't remember them all but it was--
Speaker 2: Obviously you know, Ken went on to run (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Ken was there.  Who was the guy that ran--was at Xerox [Xerox Corporation] who ultimately ran--Barry Rand [A. Barry Rand] ran Hertz [Hertz Global Holdings, Inc.].  It was individuals like that that I knew of, I didn't know them.
Speaker 2: Right and Black Enterprise was really important during this period (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That period of time and then everybody else is now doing those kinds of articles.
Speaker 2: But it was the only agency at that time--
Speaker 1: It was the only one that was doing it.
Speaker 2: Black corporate leaders.
Speaker 1: That's it exactly and that was a big eye opener for the company and what Jack did was took his executive staff, he picked fiv- fifteen of the high potential leaders in GE that are African American and fifteen women who predominantly were white women and we all did a day of beating up on diversity and what do we need to do.
Speaker 2: With him?
Speaker 1: With him and his whole staff. It was Larry Bossidy [Lawrence Bossidy] who ultimately ran AlliedSignal, Honeywell [Honeywell International, Inc.], AlliedSignal it was his staff, his executive team.  I remember I had a meeting with the African Americans and said. "Look I'm the only one here who's had some exposure to Jack and what he won't tolerate is us being all over the map.  So let's talk about how we have two or three rifle shots of things that we want to ask Jack to go do.  Have it prebaked before we go into this meeting," and he said--we were all over the map and we finally nicked it down to Jack you've got to show leadership.  We didn't have a full time individual heading diversity it was all part-time parceled out in HR at the time.
Speaker 2: And this is 1990?
Speaker 1: This is 1990 and that, there was one other item that we really wanted to do. But of the fifteen people what I noticed, I only knew three people in the room and these were the highest potential African Americans, quote, by Fairfield [Connecticut], in the company.  So we said okay who is going to be the voice that brings this home.  I was elected because I was the highest level African American in the company at that time.  I was not an officer of the company at that time, I was just a general manager (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This is high level role.
Speaker 1: It is it's one of the top six hundred people let's call it.
Speaker 2: In the whole company.
Speaker 1: In the whole company and one of the things that we got into as I was telling Jack about leadership, he stopped me dead in my tracks and he said, "Lloyd [HistoryMaker Lloyd G. Trotter] how many manufacturing plants do you have?" And I said, "Forty-three."  He said, "How many are led by African Americans?" And I said, "None."  He said, "You hire more people than I hire so what are you asking me?"  I said, "You know I could stand here and alibi and say I've done a lot, and I had. Mentoring people, getting people promoted and so on but I'm going to fall on my sword and say not enough and you will never ask me that question again but it will not take you off the hook for showing leadership."  It was an exchange between me and Jack--
Speaker 2: In front of these six hundred people (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) in front of the whole group (laughter) the whole group.  He says, "I will if you do."  I said, "You got it, that's the deal."
Story_ID: 526495
Speaker 1: Went out, I pulled together some of the people in the meeting and said, "Number one, I- I can't help you if I don't know you and we live all over the place because GE [General Electric] is so sprawling.  We've got to figure out how we do something that pulls together people so that we have a better understanding of where they are in their careers and we can give them coaching and help and so on," and that's when AAF [African American Forum] was spawned.  Long story short (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, which is African American Forum.
Speaker 1: --the African American Forum was the first affinity group in GE.
Speaker 2: And it was the only company that had done this before with Xerox [Xerox Corporation], right?
Speaker 1: No there were several actually 'cause we went and studied them AT&T [AT&T Inc.], Xerox and IBM [International Business Machines Corporation].  We went and looked at their models and tweaked it to our model.  The difference with their models, however, was they were HR [human resources] driven, HR led programs.  We decided no we cannot give up control of this initiative.  So while we'll look at HR, we don't not want them to lead it, we do not want them to design it, we want to do this on our own and that's exactly what we did.
Speaker 2: And the we was the--
Speaker 1: The African Americans that I had pulled in and co-opted into the group and that's how we got started.
Speaker 2: And, and how did you find candidates?
Speaker 1: People that worked with us.  Well a good start was the fifteen people in the room (laughter) for that meeting of which I--who were perceived to be the best and brightest that their businesses had to offer.  And then from there once AAF was spawned, we spent a lot of time getting to know more people and so on because while we had regional meetings the way we designed it and then we had an annual meeting where it started off our first annual meeting was probably in 1993 or so.  There were three hundred African Americans in that meeting, we met in D.C. [Washington D.C.].  This past year they just had a meeting, (laughter) yeah 2016 there were sixteen hundred African Americans in the meeting.
Speaker 2: And that's in high leadership roles.
Speaker 1: In different roles, not high leadership but they were a part of the conference.  But, you know, we went from the first African American officer in the company in 1990 that was me when they made me vice president of manufacturing to there are twelve African American officers in the company today, two of which are senior VPs [vice presidents] as opposed to--when you're a senior VP, to frame it, you're one of the top twenty individuals in the whole company.  We went from me being the lone guy controlling maybe at the time about I don't know ten percent of the revenues in the industrial business.  At one point 48 percent of the company's revenues were controlled by African Americans.  So not just trivial diversity jobs or HR jobs which aren't trivial but it was controlling businesses that hired and grew the population and you had a say--more than a say, you set the direction for what you were doing.
Story_ID: 526496
Speaker 1: Now as the company [General Electric]--you weren't part of NBC for example because that was a different business--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: But diversifying all around was a difficult thing for them to do.
Speaker 2: Right. And--but what we did you mentioned [HistoryMaker] Paula Madison, we co-opted them to become a part of AAF [African American Forum] and they then had their own group, working their own set of issues where we could give them support and help.  You know, and at that point I was in a position where I could walk into the senior VP [vice president] of HR [human resources] and say this is screwed up and you need to fix it over in AB- NBC you know, kind of thing because I had their ear.  So it was--while there were still different businesses, we had an impact on every one of those businesses. You know, Paula Madison became the first African American officer in NBC and literally NBC is different in that I remember chatting with Paula.  They have titles vice president this, but they are really not officers of the company and walking them through what a real career and seat at the table looked like was a little bit different than--you know, they're artsy (laughter).  Now I probably could never work there because I remember we, at our corporate executive counsel, I was running a business, Bob Wright was running NBC and every once and a while he'd try and tell me how to sell circuit breakers and every once in a while I'd tell him how to do programming and get productivity.  One day he was standing there and his margins weren't where they needed to be, I said, "Well you know 'The Cosby Show' is one of your better shows," and he said, "Yeah it brings in a lot of revenue and income."  I said, "Well I could probably make that show work with three kids as opposed to five and you could save some money," (laughter) and he said, "Yeah right."
Speaker 1: Never mind.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Never mind. But that was the kind of collegial bantering back and forth we would do.
Story_ID: 526497
Speaker 1: Back to the African American Forum [AAF]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --so obviously it's still going.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How did it affect the business overall?  Did other affinity groups start as a result?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was five years before the next one was formed and they used our same format with a few tweaks that I'll tell you about.  It was a woman's forum [Women's Network] that emerged next and since then there has been Hispanic Forum and Asian Pacific forum [Asian Pacific American Forum] and so on. But it was five years of the African American Forum when others decided that they wanted to pull something together.  The other forums--the only difference was they were more corporate driven than--driven and supported--than the African American Forum which was more up from the ranks kind of thing and it is still today for the most part.  I remember early on in the African American Forum, Jack [Jack Welch] and I were talking about it and he said, "What kind of budget do you need?" And I said, "I don't want your budget, if I take your budget you're going to try and tell me what to do or some of your HR [human resource] folks will and I don't want that.  You've got to let me run with this," and he said, "Fine tell me when you need help."  Now the reality is what I did was picked up the phone and called my fellow CEOs and said, "Write a check, I don't want to hear about it just write a check," and that's how we put on our events and so on.
Speaker 1: CEOs from the other GE [General Electric] businesses (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Other GE businesses and my business would close the gap on what we needed as a budget.  But we did that for--
Speaker 1: What kinds of events did you do?
Speaker 2: Well we do regional events where the rule was you invite the highest ranking business leader to the event and have him talk about what diversity means to him and his business in that area which was if he comes his HR function is going to come and you'll get a chance to network with him and so on.  Oh by the way he'll probably pay for it (laughter) which always happened.  So we'd make each region do three quarterly events and then we did a national event that we used to do every year.  Now they're doing it every other year. But--
Speaker 1: And is that because diversity has improved so much?
Speaker 2: It's that and then the cost of it.  The national event is really about a million and a half to two million dollars to put on with the content and everything else that was going on.  We would do those--we were doing those every year at the time and they couldn't--when you think about the other diversity groups if everybody did it every year that would be a lot of money.  There's another subtle difference between them.  The women's and other forums that came later they try and pick maybe fifteen people from each business so it's a much smaller event than the African American Forum.  I remember asking Jack and then Jeff Immelt [Jeffrey R. Immelt] whether they wanted us to change the format and they said there is so much energy we don't and the African American group anybody that wants to come can come and hopefully their business will support them.  My attitude was you spend that much on a good time on a weekend and if it's important to your career figure out how to get there.  Hence, you'd have twelve, seventeen hundred people or so at the African American event and you'd have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because even if their company-if their business didn't pay for it, they did.
Speaker 2: Right, exactly. But 99 percent of them were paid for by the business it really was.  They haven't changed that rule.  So you might have a woman's event--annual event that may have three, four hundred people contrasted to the African American event with seventeen hundred people.
Story_ID: 526498
Speaker 1: That occurs in 1990.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That's also the year that you become vice president and general manager of--what is GE [General Electric] ED and C?
Speaker 2: General Elec- Electrical Distribution and Controls business, that's when I became vice president of the manufacturing group.  In '91 [1991] I became president and CEO of that business as well.
Speaker 1: So can you explain how that works because what is Jack's [Jack Welch] role?
Speaker 2: He's president and CEO of the whole company--
Speaker 1: Whole company.
Speaker 2: --and all of the thirteen businesses report directly to him along with the--I call it the staff, the head of HR [human resources] for the whole company.  You know, all of the HR leaders in the divisions report to that head of HR.  All of the finance leaders in the division report to Dennis Dammerman at the time the CFO for the company that reported directly to Jack.  So this big company was divided into thirteen business units and each having its own president and CEO in the thirteen business unit heads along with the Fairfield [Connecticut] staff which was about thirty-three people.  We were the corporate executive council for the whole company and met quarterly.
Speaker 1: And what is--who are your peers in this?
Speaker 2: At the time it would have been CEO of lighting who was John Opie [John D. Opie], the CEO of appliances, the CEO of med systems and power generation CEO.  So there were thirteen businesses like that.  Gary Wendt the head of GE Capital [General Electric Capital Corporation].  All of them--you know Bob Wright we talked about him a little bit earlier, head of NBC--NBCUniversal [New York, New York] ultimately.
Speaker 1: So shy of the position that you were in at that point this is president and CEO of this division, you then become president and CEO of General Electric Company.
Speaker 2: Yeah president and CEO of GE Industrial [General Electric Industrial Solutions] was next which was the--we rolled up three of the businesses.  ED&C was about 3.2 billion [dollars] in revenue and then GE Industrial which happened in 2005 and I became a senior VP [vice president] at that point in time of the company.  It was rolling up appliances, lighting and my old business which made it a $14 billion company, you know, at that point in time.  So it was a much bigger business and much bigger entity for General Electric at that point in time.
Speaker 1: And who are your contemporaries at this point?
Speaker 2: They are still the same CEOs but they are no longer thirteen businesses.  It nicked down to maybe six businesses and I was one of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Jack has--
Speaker 2: Yeah after we start rolling things together and making them bigger and Jeff [Jeffrey R. Immelt] rolling things together and making them bigger.  So the structure changed but how big the businesses were.  Instead of being 3 billion dollar business, now I'm a $14 billion business, and--
Speaker 1: But they are businesses that are folding in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Folding into together and we got synergies--
Speaker 1: And some people were also losing their job.
Speaker 2: Absolutely we got synergies and putting them together, the back rooms were the same, one IT function not three, sales were pretty separate but manufacturing--only one manufacturing leader not three.
Story_ID: 526499
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And is this because automation and--
Speaker 2: I- it was driven by a couple of things.  The businesses themselves in the scheme of things even though it sounds like a three billion dollar business is big, it's not and they were sub scale and they needed to get more productivity in order to reinvest in themselves at a different rate.  When I rolled the lighting business, the appliance business into my industrial business there was two things that I knew.  We had to take out structure, we reduced the number of executive bands and above by 43 percent across the company.  But my commitment to the teams were that we would re-invest ourselves at a much more rapid rate and what we did was I used a simple metric so that people could understand and measure my say/do ratio by saying we have eleven hundred engineers designing product around the world and that's not enough.  We need in order to secure our future to release new products at a much more rapid clip and in order to do that we need to more than double the number of engineers that we're paying for to do it but we've got to take the cost from someplace.  No one is going to let us take our eyes off the quarters and the years and so on.  We've got to invest in ourselves.  So my commitment to you, we're going to go from eleven hundred engineers to twenty five hundred engineers while going through this major restructuring in order to pay for it.  Every month, every year I post how far we've gone on that journey.  We got--when I left it was thirty two hundred not twenty five hundred engineers designing products for us.  Instead of episodically introducing appliances as an example, one product a year we were introducing every three months new products.  Which then caused us--helped us grow faster, increase our market share and do a lot of things differently that really, you know, that the company needed (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And how are the products changing?
Speaker 2: Well the products are more--they're smarter.  You and your appliances today they're more electronics in it, they have sensors in it that do different things.  There are more features and functions.  A washing machine, our dryers no longer a dryer it now does steam cleaning as opposed to just drying and stuff like that.  That wasn't heard of, you know, before.  So it really has changed the functionality of those appliances and it's the same thing in the industrial business.  Lighting has gone more to energy saving lamps like LEDs as opposed to incandescent 60 watt light bulbs and stuff like that.  Those are huge transformations in technology and science that sort of keeps the companies on the map you know, kind of thing.  Some businesses quite frankly we had to get out of because they were so commoditized.  I went to Fairfield [Connecticut] after doing this business in 2000--let me get this right--2005 as the executive vice president of operations for the whole company and that put me into the top seven individuals in the company in driving, restructuring and productivity across the company which again was how do we do more with less.  And then a year later after that, that's when I became vice chairman of the industrial business which was a $38 billion segment.  If you think about the company it's about 150 billion in revenue about 100 billion of that is the industrial businesses where we make actual products and then the rest of it is GE Capital [General Electric Capital Corporation] and was in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] at the time.  So when you think about it, I was running a third of the industrial businesses trying to figure out what stays, what goes back to where Jack [Jack Welch] was.  If you can't be number one and two and you have some secret sauce, you've got to get rid of it.  I sold the plastics business, I sold the silicone business which took the portfolio down from 38 billion to 28 billion.  There were roughly (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Those early on have been very important.
Speaker 2: They were in fact. You know they were very, very important but making plastic pellets is a commoditized product, you can't get price for it.  There is no differentiator and that's not (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Anybody can make it.
Speaker 2: --anybody can do it and that's not where you want to be you know, kind of thing.  So it's how do you remake yourself.  You know one of the factors you've got to start with--General Electric is the only original Dow company.
Speaker 1: Original?
Speaker 2: Dow under Dow Industrial Average [Dow Jones Industrial Average] everybody else has disappeared, Westinghouse [Westinghouse Electric Corporation].  They couldn't figure out how to remake themselves enough to stay in business.  Westinghouse is a great example.  They were our biggest competitor, they no longer exist.  So General Electric has been able to figure out how to remake itself over and over again.  The businesses are not the same obviously but it's still under the same umbrella with a growth strategy with innovation as a main theme of what they're going to do and that's what you had to do as a business leader.

Speaker 1: As you are growing in your position [at General Electric], because you--it's at a pretty fast clip.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean you are being promoted almost every year it looks like.  Who are your mentors?
Speaker 2: Well a lot; once you become a senior executive ban really Fairfield [Connecticut] takes over on placement and what you're going to do next.  So a lot of the mentors that would maybe make a difference are in Fairfield the Jack Welch's of the world, the Ben Heinemans [Benjamin W. Heineman] of the world, you know people like that.  But then on the sideline there are individuals who are your peers that you're also taking coaching from and having to get advice.  But more importantly by then--by the time I got to leading a bigger business there were other officers of the company--twelve of them in fact that were in similar positions where we could mentor each other.  Just because I was maybe a step ahead or whatever doesn't mean that they can't give you great advice and you can capitalize on what they're seeing and mold it into what you ought to be thinking about.  So it comes from people below you, from people who are peers and people above you.  Some of the best help I ever got in my manufacturing career was from hourly employees who gave me advice about you better watch your back (laughter).  Now I remember early on in my career where I was an industrial engineer at a manufacturing plant and literally I had this brilliant idea that now in retrospect it wasn't that brilliant, it was really pretty bad and the plant they were threatening a strike, they were doing this and all of a sudden magically it started working and I'm standing there at a machine where I had done this it was like reduce the workforce by a third.  They didn't get laid off, they went to other areas of the plant but we were going to do three times as much work with a third of the people and I thought it was great.  I thought I had really thought it through and this young lady, Sadie [ph.] I remember her.  She was a twenty-five year employee, African American female and I'm standing there watching it work, smiling and she said, "You're pretty proud of yourself aren't you?"  I said, "Yeah it's finally beginning to gel and it's working."  And she said, "You are really proud of yourself aren't you?"  I said, "Yeah, I am." She says, "Well the reason it's working has nothing to do about you."  I said, "Yeah? Tell me about it."  She said, "Look they were getting ready to go out on strike, I've been here for twenty-five years and we had a meeting in the ladies' room." 60, 70 percent of the employees in the lighting plant are female.  I said, "What went on in the ladies' room?"  She said, "I told them we have dumb ideas for white folks, we're going to do dumb ideas for this black kid so get out there, we ain't going on strike, go to work." And she was the turning point. She was the turning point.  I said, "Why would you do that for me?"  She said, "I have a grandson about your age and he's out there doing dumb ideas too and I hope somebody saves his butt" (laughter).  But all my life I've had secretaries and people like that who I had gotten to know who from different ways helped me, saved me, if you will, in some cases.  If you are so arrogant you're not listening, you won't see that you know, kind of thing.  But I've had people again below that were huge supporters and they did it in their own way.  People who were peers who have been huge, huge supporters and they did it in their own way and then people from the top pulling me up. So it was that triangulation that really was the difference I think.
Story_ID: 526501
Speaker 1: I'd like for you to share moments when things didn't work so well, how you managed through.
Speaker 2: Well you know, one of the worst bocum [ph.] operating meetings I had, I went into the meeting in January thinking that we had come pretty close to nailing our budget for the year when the finance guy pulled me aside and said, "We have a problem."  I said, "What's the problem?" He said, "We're going to miss by a mile.  We had some issues with accounting in one area of the world in Europe, I didn't see it coming.  We've got to correct it, we had this, that and the other."  I remember after getting a better understanding of how bad the miss was and I had told Jack [Jack Welch] we were on track, I had to pull Jack aside and said, "Hey Jack, we're having a problem closing the books." And he said, "Tell me about it."  I said, "Well I hate it because I'm letting you down here, but we're going to miss by something close to $80 to $100 million," and he said, "Okay that's not nearly as bad as when I got a call from Capital [General Electric Capital Corporation] and Kidder Peabody [Kidder, Peabody and Co.] blew up on us and they missed by $350 million" (laughter).  He said, "Go away, figure out what happened and then come back and tell me what you learned." And that was the conversation we had and that's what we did.  We put ourselves back together and kept running but it wasn't one and done and you're out or whatever.  It was, you know, how do you make this a learning experience for the organization and for you, me personally in my case so that we have tighter controls and you don't get surprises like this.  You're always going to be surprised.  There's something going on someplace in the world that you won't see but the reality was that was really, really the toughest conversation, the longest walk I had to get to the conversation, ever.
Story_ID: 526502
Speaker 1: Did you over the years based upon your role have any interaction with presidents of the United States?
Speaker 2: Not a lot. More congressmen like a Charlie Rangel [HistoryMaker Charles B. Rangel] and you know, people like that.  Definitely met Barack [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] but I can't say I'm in anybody's inner circle or anything like that.
Speaker 1: So in terms of your job did--what I guess--what level of government official did you need to work with (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It would be senator, congressmen and stuff like that and it was generally an appeal around assets we had in their district that they ought to be aware of.  And number one, things that they were trying to change that maybe could impact employment in their district, you know, kind of thing.  So I was on the Hill [Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.] a lot but it was more senators and congressmen.  The case with Charlie Rangel, he has a very big Puerto Rican population in his voting base and they were changing this law called 936 [International Revenue Code Section 936] and I'm the third largest employer in Puerto Rico and it was a jobs bill that made Puerto Rico look different than most islands in that they have a fairly significant industrial base there.  Now the reality was it was created to give us low taxes to offset job creation in Puerto Rico.  We employed roughly six thousand employees in our factories there.  Now the pharmaceuticals employed very few people but they got huge tax subsidies as a result of it and that's what they were coming after. And I remember sitting down with Charlie and saying, "You gotta--we did it the right way and while looking at what you substituted for, if there isn't some help in taxes for job creation we're probably going to have to leave the island."  We were kidding back and forth and he said, "You wouldn't do that would you?"  I said, "Look congressman, I've got to tell you that if there isn't a substitute there won't be enough barges to get us off the island fast enough."  He said, "You would do it wouldn't you?"  I said, "If I don't somebody else will, let's be clear here.  It doesn't make sense for us to be there without some kind of subsidy or support."  You know and they did put another bill in place but those were the kind of conversations you had.  It was more around assets that you had in someone's district, what do they need to help either grow the business faster, protect the fact that we want to be in your district and here's the things that we do to help make that happen, you know, kind of thing and there were a lot of conversations that way.
Speaker 1: And (cough) so in addition to your inward facing work the outward facing is with the government, with community leaders, with (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly the leader of Puerto Rico and sitting down and talking to them about their role for keeping us there.  Around the world in fact sitting down with some of the politicians and Beijing, China, did interview with the head of Panama because we built the first controls for the Panama Canal and we built the subsequent controls for the new canal and talking about how the partnership between GE [General Electric] and Panama had worked over the years and continues to work.  So yeah you've got to meet and sit down with a lot of folks whether it was in the Middle East or in Asia or Latin America or in the U.S.
Story_ID: 526503
Speaker 1: You're now at the top of the business--managing the business, you know, inside and outside, you're also now sitting on corporate boards and not for profit.
Speaker 2: I am.
Speaker 1: Tell me about that.
Speaker 2: Now it's mostly corporate boards.  I rolled out of GE [General Electric]--GE as an officer you're not allowed to sit on public boards.  That's when I sat on not for profit boards like United Way [United Way Worldwide] and A Better Chance, NACME, National Action Council for Minority Engineers [sic. National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering, Inc.] and stuff like that.
Speaker 1: You did those things when you were--
Speaker 2: Right and I did some of it afterwards as well but then schedules started rotating out and it was time for them to get better connected with people who could also support them with their foundation.
Speaker 1: So you could not be on these public boards until you left, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Could not, that was a rule.
Story_ID: 526504
Speaker 1: So then before we get to the boards, talk about your decision to leave.  You'd been there thirty-eight years.
Speaker 2: I got old and I decided it was time to retire (laughter).  You know. Seriously at the time I was sixty-two and I tell young folks I never intended to have a thirty-eight-year career with General Electric.  I wanted to garner some experiences, exposure, understand how businesses worked and I wanted to be an entrepreneur and I was getting to a point where if I'm ever going to do something, I ought to do it now and that's when in fact I made the decision to retire and quite frankly it was a different GE too.  We had a new CEO, I worked for Jeff [Jeffrey R. Immelt] for seven years--
Speaker 1: Jeff Immelt.
Speaker 2: Yeah Jeff Immelt for seven years (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what was it like working with him?
Speaker 2: Well he was different.  Jeff I'd known because we sat on the corporate executive council.  He was running the Med Systems business [General Electric Medical Systems; General Electric Healthcare Worldwide], I was running the industrial business [General Electric Industrial Systems] so we had a lot of interaction and then he became the business leader replacing Jack [Jack Welch] in 2001, the last two promotions with Jeff.  When I became executive VP [vice president]--well the last three promotions when we decided to roll the consumer and industrial businesses together that was Jeff he asked me to do it.  When we decided to do the executive VP of ops [operations] role that was Jeff and then finally the vice chairman was Jeff everything prior to that was Jack.
Speaker 1: So were you on the same track as Jeff to possibly be CEO?
Speaker 2: No. No. GE has a history of electing CEOs that have a twenty-year runway.  So by the time Jack left I didn't have twenty years left, you know, kind of thing.  So the candidates were in their mid-forties, Jeff was forty-three years old when he became CEO.  Jack was forty-two years old when he became CEO.  So literally they don't do five year, six year CEOs, haven't done it in the last three or four CEOs.  So there was no way--I knew that maybe I'd be doing more in a support role but not in--bantered around for running the company.
Speaker 1: And you said it was different working with Jeff.
Speaker 2: Well Jack was an operating guy who came at things because that was his background.  Actually he's a Ph.D. polymer scientist, you'd never know it but he is.  He was on the development team that developed plastics and the resin in corporate research development and then they gave him the job of operationalizing it in building a business.  It was one of the only businesses that we built from nothing. You know, and that was his claim to fame.  Jeff is a marketing, sales guy who comes at things differently.  So working for the two is different on how they see the world and what's going to be important to them and so on. And I quite frankly with the age of the internet and so on, we needed to get away from Jack and into something that says how do we use these new tools in a way that benefits the whole company.  Jeff probably was the right choice, you know, kind of thing.  But I would have never been considered.
Speaker 1: Got it. So you were there under Jeff's leadership for seven years?
Speaker 2: Seven years.
Story_ID: 526505
Speaker 1: As you're planning your departure there are other former GE [General Electric] employees who are creating a business is that correct?
Speaker 2: Well yeah they--there was Art Harper [HistoryMaker Arthur H. Harper] who decided that and it wasn't retirement, he decided that he wanted to follow his entrepreneurial dream. Jim (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was his role there?
Speaker 2: He was head of one of the GE Capital [General Electric Capital Corporation] businesses, I can't remember the name of it at this point but he was a senior VP [vice president] and on the Corporate Executive Council with me at that point in time.  Jim Shepard [James Shepard] who was running a portion of the security business worked for me and he was an officer of the company too. Not a senior VP and not on the executive council but an officer.  They were beginning to talk about forming this business along with Ron Blaylock [Ronald E. Blaylock] who had his own business Blaylock and Associates [sic. Blaylock and Company] but he was tired of it and was going to sell and wanted to do something else.  I entered into it and said do you want another partner, but this was in the formation stage, it hadn't even got off the ground and they were doing some planning.  We all decided to put hands in the pile and do it together.
Speaker 1: And this is 2008?
Speaker 2: This was 2007 actually.
Speaker 1: Two thousand seven [2007].
Speaker 2: Because it was an overlap for me where I got special permission from GE to do a little bit of both.
Story_ID: 526506
Speaker 1: But I see here that the boards, I just want to go back for a second because it looks like in '07 [2007] you were director at Genpact Limited is that a board?
Speaker 2: That's an internal GE [General Electric] company.
Speaker 1: Okay what were you doing there?
Speaker 2: Well we used to have a big entity in India that was a in-house back room for GE Capital [General Electric Capital Corporation] and some of the other companies that did accounting and payroll and stuff like that.  It was roughly twenty thousand employees.  We decided that it would be in the best interest of the company to spin that out as a public company.  We spun it out as a public company but GE still owned at that time 60 percent of that and the rest was owned by the public on the New York Stock Exchange [New York, New York], GenPak and then today it is a totally public company so GE has no board seats or anything like that.
Speaker 1: But at the time you were in the transitional period (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At the time we were in the transition and I was a part of that transition.
Speaker 1: And then when you became an independent director for Textron [Textron, Inc.] was that after you had left?
Speaker 2: Yeah Textron, PepsiCo, Daimler [Daimler AG], Mercedes [Mercedes-Benz] almost happened in the same year.
Speaker 1: These are huge companies.
Speaker 2: Yeah
Speaker 1: Who have--so now you have three jobs.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Plus your-
Speaker 2: My new company.
Speaker 1: --new company?
Speaker 2: That's correct.  My wife [Teri Trotter] would say I have a silly way of retiring and I'm feeling it so big time (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well but you retired at sixty-three so that's still young.
Speaker 2: Yeah I still had a lot of time to go.
Speaker 1: And this is at the time (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I would have drove her nuts going home anyway.
Story_ID: 526507
Speaker 1: This is at the time that Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] has just been elected.  I mean, it's a very exciting time for change.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so how, how--what is your role in GenNx360 [GenNx360 Capital Partners] and what is it doing?
Speaker 2: I'm a managing partner, we buy middle market companies, industrial companies, we currently have nine businesses that are in our portfolio that we have operate and run.  I'm either on their boards or doing oversight for these companies and clearly one of the voting members on whether we buy them or not, you know, kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Your role is kind of like what you were doing at Genpact [Genpact Limited].
Speaker 2: And what I was doing in GE [General Electric] in a sense.
Speaker 1: Once you were at that high level position.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So GE obviously is a much larger business.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: How profitable is GenNx360?
Speaker 2: I think we're doing well and the way you know you're doing well.  In our first fund we raised $600 million from limited partners, our second fund we've raised $600 million so if you don't give people back more money than they give you, they don't invest again.  So I think we're doing well.  I mean, like every company you have things that could impact you, like the economy.  We have a couple of businesses in fund one that was oil and gas related and that's not a lot of fun but they're holding their own.  But have some businesses that were, especially chemical, that we did very well with, you know kind of thing.
Speaker 1: And so as a much smaller company are you more directly impacted by what's happening in the world.
Speaker 2: Yeah you have fewer degrees of--you might have in your portfolio a $1 billion of revenue actually we had around $2.2 billion of revenue but the companies are different and they're not a part of a team.  They each stand alone so you don't have the skill that you had in General Electric.  So when I was running $38 billion company as a vice chairman I looked at it and said I owe you, Jeff [Jeffrey R. Immelt] $2 billion of profit.  It didn't necessarily come the way that we said but I could deliver $2 billion of profit while maybe the appliance business was going the wrong way but the industrial business propped it up.  In an unbalance I gave them the $2 billion of profit that I said I was going to generate.  You can't do that in private equity.  Each business stands on its own, each business is evaluated and with its up and downs and win/loss ratios and all that other good stuff.  So it is a much different scenario on how you look at businesses and how they have to stand on their own on whether they're making the progress that you want them to make.
Story_ID: 526508
Speaker 1: I'm curious because you started this business right around the time when the economy fell apart.
Speaker 2: Right the banking crisis.  You know, and we still go back and say during the banking crisis our first fund never worked in private equity before we raised the six million dollar fund.  That you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Why do you think that was?
Speaker 2: I think they were betting on the skill set and that we had a different model because it wasn't on the demonstrated operational expertise in private equity that's for sure.  But it was one of these things where they said here's change and we want to be a part of it.
Speaker 1: And so you're business grew--has grown consistently in a time when banks went out of business.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Big banks.
Speaker 2: Big banks.
Speaker 1: Global banks.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah the Merrill Lynch's [Merrill Lynch Wealth Management] of the world and so on.  You know, but again it was again a bet I think that we could maybe bring something to the space that was different.  I like to characterize ourselves as a group of operating individuals that understand banking as opposed to a group of bankers that want to be operating guys and they've never done it before and that's essentially the difference.
Speaker 1: How many people are a part of GenNx360 [GenNx360 Capital Partners]?
Speaker 2: On our payroll when you look at people in the management company around thirty-two. Okay but in our portfolio companies if you added up all of the employees that we have in our businesses that we own and all of our businesses we own controlling share of you're talking about thirty two hundred.
Speaker 1: And is this a global business as well?
Speaker 2: It's global we have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Where are the other countries?
Speaker 2: Each business is different but if you look at a company like Syncreon they employ roughly I guess eighteen hundred people.
Speaker 1: Where is that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They are Europe, Russia, Brazil, Mexico, China. And in--a little bit in the Middle East and South Africa.
Story_ID: 526509
Speaker 1: How are these companies in your business [GenNx360 Capital Partners] affected by the rhetoric of the presidential election?
Speaker 2: Not so much because I don't think anybody is yet unless somebody follows through on what they're doing.  They're more affected by Brexit and what's real not what's being contemplated.
Speaker 1: That for some is foreshadowing, or the belief that it could be foreshadowing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well I do believe there's a cloud of uncertainty that is inhibiting growth in expanding the global economies but even before we got into this presidential election if you take Germany out of Europe it's negative growth and that was before we started talking about things about building walls and Mexico, to keep Mexicans out and the fact that we want to renegotiate every trade agreement known to man.  The economies around the world have been somewhat anemic which includes, you know, while we're growing, we're the best of, I call it in a race of pigs we're the fastest pig but these are not economies that anybody can write home to and say we're proud of.  No matter what happens somehow we got to get this thing back on track.  We have not been in a global economy with global rules. We--if we want to really see more job growth, wages growing and so on we got to get back on track in the U.S. 3 to 4 percent.  In Europe it would be great just to see 2 to 3 percent.  Asia even, China is only growing at--I say only, we give our eye and teeth for it--6 percent but in the good old days they were growing 9 to 10 percent.
Speaker 1: The good old days would have been when?
Speaker 2: That goes back to before Barack [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama].
Speaker 1: Way before right?
Speaker 2: Not way before no. No, no, they were still growing at about 8, 9 percent in the early years (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) During the Bush [President George Walker Bush]--
Speaker 2: Because they didn't get impacted by some of the stuff that was happening.  In fact they were the recipient of job flight and exports.  So it wasn't that they could buy the products they were making but clearly they were making a lot of products because it was a cheap labor source.
Speaker 1: Do you still interact with government leaders, members of congress in your business today?
Speaker 2: Not so much no we're too small maybe here and there but no not really.
Speaker 1: Did or even could GE [General Electric] invest in your company?
Speaker 2: They did and they are in both funds.
Speaker 1: Good. So you've maintained that relationship?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 526510
Speaker 1: What advice would you give to folks who are building relationships in business especially when they leave? You know, 'cause exits can be very challenging and often don't end up with investments.
Speaker 2: That's true but I think it's how you leave. You know, and then how you live your life while you were there, you know kind of thing.  You never want to burn bridges, you always want to--in fact when we left it wasn't clear that GE [General Electric] was going to invest in us.  Two guys left earlier than they wanted them to and then the other guy got old.  But at the end of the day they looked at us and said you have guys have the skill set that we can invest in and we will.  That was the sort of thing that they did. And by GE investing when we had other investors ask if GE is in your fund that helped us with fundraising to be honest.
Speaker 1: Because they could see that they continue to have faith in you (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My dialogue with Jeff Immelt [Jeffrey R. Immelt] was, you know, you may or may not invest but we'd like to do is you're always buying and selling stuff and we want to make sure that you call us when you've got something for sale and help us with deal flow.  We still got to give you a competitive price and he knew that and I knew that without even saying it but we'd like to believe that we have a slight edge on some of the divestitures that you're doing.
Speaker 1: And that has occurred?
Speaker 2: No we haven't bought anything (laughter).
Speaker 1: Theoretically.
Speaker 2: Theoretically it was a nice thing to say right?
Story_ID: 526511
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, I see that i- in your retirement you joined the Guardsmen [National Association of Guardsmen, Inc.].
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: My daddy used to belong to that, tell me--tell me about the Guardsmen.
Speaker 2: Well it's a great group of successful African American men that--while the Boule [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity, Inc.] they do a lot of civics stuff and so on but this is a group that just wants to hang out and chat and yeah does it flow that we talk about business here and there but that's not the main purpose of what it is.  It's building a relationship and camaraderie with a group of guys who have really done some amazing things in their career.
Speaker 1: And that that was not possible for you when you were at GE [General Electric] time wise?
Speaker 2: Time wise no I didn't know about it (laughter).  No, no, no I couldn't have joined the Guardsmen, I didn't know about it and nobody asked me so I didn't get there.  But a lot of the members of the Guardsmen are employed.  We have a couple of GE guys in the Connecticut Guardsmen that are in--they came in after I did once I got in and we had some openings.  I started talking to them; yeah I want to be in.
Speaker 1: Well because there's probably a lot of great mentoring that can--
Speaker 2: There is and just great contacts and somebody who has gone through what you've gone through and can relate to it and maybe put a different spin on how to react, you know kind of thing.  But I think there is a fair amount of mentoring but it isn't any roughly giving back to the community.  Most Guardsmen including me are Boule members that's where we do that.
Speaker 1: Right so it's a different role.
Speaker 2: It's a different role and they've been around for quite a while. The first chapter was the Brooklyn Chapter, Brooklyn, New York [New York] and then there are eighteen chapters of Guardsmen now around the country.
Story_ID: 526512
Speaker 1: You said that you've done a lot of mentoring over your career--
Speaker 2: And still do.
Speaker 1: And still do. How do you choose your mentees?
Speaker 2: You know it's a combination of sometimes they choose me and it sticks and sometimes just in meeting people.  Some of the mentees are family member friends or friends and their family or whatever.  But it's all of the above whether it's as a result of being someplace and doing a speech, or whatever. And you build a relationship.
Speaker 1: But you know one of the biggest challenges is having enough time.  What does mentoring look like for you?
Speaker 2: Well I tell people don't use that word mentor too loosely and by that I mean there is a difference in giving career advice and so on and being a true mentor.  A true mentor in my mind is somebody that you can call on the weekend and at home and say I need to talk to you about this. Because a lot of companies have formal mentoring programs and I think they're misnamed.  Where they match a person up with an individual until you get to a trust factor with that individual it's a buddy system it is not mentoring.  You're on your guard and he's on his guard--he or she and you really don't get to real candid conversations where you walk out of a room and I said to a young guy, "That was the stupidest question I ever heard in my life don't ever do that again."  It isn't that you're trying to be harsh but it is real direct candid feedback where as long as you're in a buddy mode you're both posturing, you're not really in a true mentoring role.  So there are a ton of people that I talk to episodically but there isn't--I wouldn't call it, I'm their mentor.  Then there are people that like some of the guys that are still at GE [General Electric] like Russell Stokes who is running my old business now.  He's a young African American senior VP [vice president] on his game running a fourteen billion dollar business and he's forty-one years old and I've known him for a long time since he came into the company.  More importantly he grew up in the Cleveland, Ohio area Shaker Heights [Ohio]--he says it's Cleveland and I tell him Shaker was not Cleveland.  But his mom and dad graduated from high school [John Adams High School, Cleveland, Ohio] with me.
Speaker 1: Oh wow.
Speaker 2: His dad was president of the class that I told you about and I met him and he walked up and introduced himself.  "I went home and I was telling him about Lloyd Trotter [HistoryMaker Lloyd G. Trotter] that I wanted to meet and my dad said he went to high school with you." And he said to his father, "When were you going to get around to telling me this?" (Laughter) So real relationships where we've gotten together and so on. But, so I have this group of individuals that ask me for advice and I'm more than willing to give it but I wouldn't call me their mentors.
Speaker 1: It's a richer relationship.
Speaker 2: It's a much richer relationship.
Speaker 1: And more rare because you can't do as much.
Speaker 2: You can't do as much and it's hard to build that kind of trust where you're not posturing on both sides of the equation.
Speaker 1: But how do you say no when you know somebody needs your support but you really don't have time?
Speaker 2: I don't know that you say no it just doesn't get to a true mentoring relationship but you can give advice. You know I generally return every call.

Speaker 1: When you look over the course of your career what legacy do you hope you, you leave?
Speaker 2: Well you know I think it's--I think it's more around the people that I've helped pull through the knothole whether they were in GE [General Electric] or outside of GE.  The folks that I got a chance to build those sticky relationships--it's all about people and watching them succeed as opposed to I put numbers on the board.  You have to do that in order to stay in the game.  That to me is what I think I like most and hopefully in it I carried myself as a true role model for others that said I can get this done myself.  I think that's what it's about.  It isn't how big the businesses were or how many people were in my business or anything like that.  It is about people and their successes.
Story_ID: 526514
Speaker 1: And to the point of people and their successes when you think of in particular young African American males and females wanting to get into the work that you've done--'cause you entered in a very interesting way which shows that anything is possible, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But what advice would you give to them in following in your footsteps?
Speaker 2: Well I find a lot in coaching folks--young folks whether it was in GE [General Electric] or outside of GE.  They come in looking for you to give the answers that really they have to do the work before you can even have a quality edu- quality conversation and one of the things I remember my assistant said, "Well Lloyd [HistoryMaker Lloyd G. Trotter] this team needs to see you, you've got this mentoring session with--," I don't even remember who it was, I said, "Don't worry this will last five minutes."  Because most people show up were a career discussion that hopefully leads to a mentoring discussion and they're not prepared for the discussion they haven't done the work.  So typically I start a conversation with show me--produce a sheet of paper where you've thoughtfully thought through what you like to do and where you want to be over the next five years.  And most people like 99.999 percent of the people can't show that piece of paper.  They want to talk about it but then I ask them the question you're working on projects or you have a business element that you're running, show me your work plan for how you're going to do the things that you are supposed to do for this year and they'll produce a book.  They've thoughtfully thought about it with milestones and so on but when I ask you about the most important thing in your career you can't even give me one sheet of paper.  So go away and produce that sheet of paper and get back on my calendar and we'll talk about it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And how many come back?
Speaker 2: All of them.
Speaker 1: They do?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah. Oh yeah, all of them.  I can't remember a time where they didn't avail themselves to come back and it's a tough exercise.  Part of the exercise is figuring out what do you want to be and then look at real people in those jobs because a lot of times when people come in and they say this is the work I wanted, it's not a real job.  They've picked all of the great elements from every job and that's what they want and I'll be the first to tell them if that job was available you won't get it, I'm going to take it.  I mean it's got all of the great elements of a job but you're creating something that's not real.  But those are the, I think, real world discussions you have around career and success.
Speaker 1: And do you think that race still figures into--
Speaker 2: Oh absolutely it does.
Speaker 1: How do they--how do you manage that today?
Speaker 2: Well you know in my mind there is one thing that always works.  If you're doing the job that you do and you're making me look good, I'm going to help you. Period.  I had a rap session which I regularly did with a group of African Americans and this young man great pedigree Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and all of that stuff and he says--we're in a rap session and he says, "You know I don't think my boss likes me."  I said, "Is that a question or a statement?" And he said, "I just don't think my boss likes you [sic. me]."  Well I'm going to take it as a question.  "Probably your boss doesn't like you but as long as you do what you're supposed to do he will help you."  He came back and he said, "I don't think that's right."  I said, "Well let me try it another way. Hopefully there are two people in this world unequivocally who loves you that's your mom and dad and they're not here. You know, get over it.  The reality is you're now out of that great neighborhood that they provided for you and protected you and nurtured you and you're now in the wonderful world of real world.  People don't necessarily have to like you in order to help you but you've got to do your part." And that's something that we have to get through to people that what do they go home thinking about every night?  It's their careers and their families not about you, not about me.  You know, however, if I make the group look good and put points on the board, they'll move me, they'll play me and it will all work out.  I don't know that any of my bosses really, really liked me, but I know that they supported and helped me. But I did some things along the way that made them look good too. You know, and that's what it's about.

Speaker 1: Do you have any regrets?
Speaker 2: Yes and no. You know, I think and I say this a lot, I honestly believe the most important thing to me was my family and kids and along the way I didn't spend much time with them, (laughter) I was too busy working.  I wish I could have gotten a better work-life balance.  Now true story my family now--my grandkids they know I live by my calendar.  So I was looking at my calendar about this goes back three years ago and it said Grandparents Day in Louisville, Kentucky.  I asked my assistant what is this about?  She said, "Your grandson called," he was only twelve years old, "he said put it on your calendar and I did and you're going" (laughter).  I said, "Okay, yeah. Book the ticket."

Speaker 1: You have three children?
Speaker 2: I have three children, one of blended marriage--second marriage middle daughter and seven grandkids.  You know, so. And the older grandkids are thirteen and ten and then the rest of them are in college or getting ready to get out of college I hope (laughter).
Speaker 1: What is like today being--well see you're not retired at all so do you have, do you have (laughter)--
Speaker 2: I'm retired. (Laughter) I'm doing what I want to do not because I have to.
Speaker 1: And so do you have more time for family now?
Speaker 2: I do make more time for family but probably they would argue not enough.  I don't miss events.  I was working at GE [General Electric] and my sister [Lorraine Trotter Wrenn] got married but she scheduled it at the end of a quarter.  So the family went, I didn't go.  I had to close the quarter (laughter).  She never forge- she brings that up every time and I said well you know you knew not to schedule it at the end of the quarter (laughter).

Speaker 1: What is Lloyd Trotter [HistoryMaker Lloyd G. Trotter] doing in the next five years?
Speaker 2: I think it will be different. I will slow down on the next fund that we raise.  I won't be front and center; I'll be involved but not necessarily at the pace that I'm involved now.  I will probably do more with kids and mentoring and so on, get back into the more philanthropy side of things which I haven't given up but I'm not doing it as intensely as I did before.  But it won't be sitting and watching TV and I hate golf so I'm not going to do that.
Speaker 1: Is there anything that you'd like to share that I have not asked you?
Speaker 2: No I think we've really torn my life apart and hopefully I can put it back together after I leave here (laughter).
Speaker 1: Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Really appreciate it.
