Story_ID: 663720
Speaker 1: And I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side of the family but separately, and then we'll try to put 'em together.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yep, Constance Waldron, C-O-N-S-T-A-N-C-E, Waldron, W-A-L-D-R-O-N.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Now that I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a guess as weigh--maybe--
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh.
Speaker 1: Twenties [1920s], early '30s [1930s]--late '20s [1920s], early '30s [1930s]?
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh, you know, I meant to, to check that.  She passed on years ago.  You got me with that one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, about how old was she when you were born, do you know?
Speaker 2: She was in her early twenties.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you were born in '57 [1957], so that--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that puts--yeah, so she--it's around--'round--it's in the '30s [1930s]--ear- early '30s [1930s].
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and--well, wa- wa- where was your mother born?
Speaker 2: In Newark, New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family, in terms of how far back you can trace your ancestors or what, what you know about their activities?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I have to say, say this upfront and it probably will help us shape the interview.  I was not raised by my biological parents at all, so there's very limited information that I have about them.  Although I ha- I do--I didn't know them, but--so I don't really have much to say beyond what I'll tell you later on but don't have a history on the biological side.  I was raised by a foster family in East Orange, New Jersey, and I'm, I'm more connected there obviously.
Speaker 1: Okay, but do you know if your--if your mother, like--you know, where, where she went to school or what she did for a living and any, any of that?
Speaker 2: Well, she grew up in Newark, New Jersey.  I know she had two sisters.  She had a troubled youth.  I know that she had a very troubled youth, you know, growing, growing, growing up.  I, I, I do know that.  But that's probably the most that I really know ironically.
Speaker 1: What kind of trouble did, did she have.
Speaker 2: Oh, you know, teenage truancy, you know, not going to school and stuff like that.  She's very bright.  You know, she's very bright, but you know, she--I don't think she took school as ser- seriously as she should have.
Speaker 1: Did you know anything about her parents or, or her back- background.
Speaker 2: No, no, nothing at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and I never met her parents at all.  They were deceased by the time that I met her.
Speaker 1: So do you--do you have a general impression of what they were doing or--I mean, were they--I mean, were they doing general labor or were they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, general labor--yeah, ge- general labor.  I don't think anyone went beyond high school from what I've--from what I've heard from my siblings.
Speaker 1: Okay, (unclear) they were in north New Jersey in various places in north New Jersey?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, in Newark, New Jersey, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, when you say north--north New Jersey, I guess I have to ask 'cause I'm not from New Jersey, but, but are you referring to a place--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: --or just a general direction?
Speaker 2: --actually I'm saying Newark--
Speaker 1: Newark.
Speaker 2: The city (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Yeah, N-E-W--
Speaker 1: My fault.
Speaker 2: --A-R-K--
Speaker 1: Newark, okay.
Speaker 2: Newark, New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Newark.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they were in Newark?
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) All right.
Story_ID: 663721
Speaker 1: So your mother [Waldron's biological mother, Constance Waldron], did she finish high school?
Speaker 2: Yes she did.  No--well, no, no, she did not.  I'm sorry; no, she did not; she did not, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right, and so, so at a certain point--I mean--well, you were born in '57 [1957]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --so did--I mean, was, was she not able to take care of you or keep you at that point?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm, I'm (unclear)--yeah, I'll be real clear about that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Both my parents were chronic alcoholics, so we all were removed from the home at, at different points.  And I was raised by my foster family.  And you'll find that I don't like using the word foster because it's the only family that I've--that I've--that I've known very, very well.  I was with them from five months--my entire life.  So I came into their lives at five months, so we have a very unique bond.  So, yeah--so, yeah, that's, that's it.  I met my mother--my biological mother when I was fourteen years old I wanna say, and, and I met my siblings.  There were a total of five of us, and I met them at different times as well.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you went your entire life without really knowing your mother?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: I mean--well, well, most of your, your ear- early life anyway--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --without knowing her.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.  I knew the name, of course, and just the bare facts, that which I probably still hold to today, but not, not mo- not much.  But I will say that as the years went by we developed a, a good--a good friendship.  I use the word friendship.  You know, we, we were--we were close before she died.  She asked me to handle all her affairs in the event of her death, that type of thing.  I know she was very, very proud of me.  And, and looking back at it, I--I'm very pleased with how things went.  I just feel that things happen as they should, and there're basic facts of life, and that is one of 'em.  And I think if anyone can get something out of my life story, it will be that.  You know, you accept things the way they are, and you realize that you're not the first one; you're not the only one; and you still can build a productive life despite that.  And that's something that I'm pretty strong about.  You can build beyond what you were given at the beginning.  You can shape something good.
Speaker 1: Absolutely, I mean--that's one thing this collection of interviews shows is that people don't always have what pe- the background that you would--that other folks expect them to have.  I mean, we--you know.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, so.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: But, but then again they do have somebody in their life that really makes a difference, so--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: So in terms of--so your--both of your parents, your mother and fa- father [Waldron's biological father, Clarence Harris] were alcoholics--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --biological--
Speaker 2: Absolutely, yes.
Speaker 1: And so the state intervened--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --at a certain point and--
Speaker 2: Absolutely, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  People always ask me, "Well, what do you think it would have been like being raised by your biological family?"  And I was always a smart enough kid to realize that I was in a better place, you know, in East Orange [New Jersey], the town that I grew up in.  I grew up in a you know, a three story home--a big--a big house--I mean, a big house with the, the tree lined streets and all that.  So I grew up, you know, I guess it's the suburbs so to speak at that point.  East Orange was the suburbs back then, not now, back then.  And I understood the difference between that and being raised in the projects, which is where, of course, my, my mother lived in Newark [New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I understood the difference.
Story_ID: 663722
Speaker 1: Now let me ask you about your biological father before I go to your step- your, your foster parents [Bertha Hill Culver and Alexander Culver].
Speaker 2: Sure, sure.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell--
Speaker 2: Yep--
Speaker 1: --and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Clarence Harris.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you know about what his date of birth is?
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh, you got me again.  I'll say that I know he died in 1995.  He was born in Oxford, North Carolina.  And by the time he's a teenager, he, he and his mother moved to Newark, New Jersey, and that's where he met my mother [Waldron's biological mother, Constance Waldron].
Speaker 1: Okay, is there any, any story about how your parents met or how they got together?
Speaker 2: Never heard of the story; never heard a story.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, and so I take it they, they weren't married.
Speaker 2: They were not married.
Speaker 1: Okay, him being a Harris and her being a Waldron.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: But--so at a--did--so they--I guess perhaps that they, they weren't even together when you were born?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  I think--well, no, no, no, no, no, that's not true.  The romance lasted many, many years I was told by my biological brother, you know, who was raised by my biological mother.  You know, there--there was a romance.  It, it went on for a long time.
Story_ID: 663723
Speaker 1: Your biological brother, he's older than you, right?
Speaker 2: No, he's younger than me.
Speaker 1: He's younger, okay.
Speaker 2: He's two years younger.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the story--we always heard our, our mother [Waldron's biological mother, Constance Waldron] say is that she lost all her other children.  He was the last one that she's going to have and she was determined that the state was--would not get him.  So she would literally take him wherever she would go.  And if that meant going to the taverns--the bars, she tried to get him in there; just wherever she'd go, she'd have her little--her little one with her always, 'cause she was not gonna let another one be taken away, yeah.
Speaker 1: So what, what did he say about that life?  I mean, what did he--
Speaker 2: You know, he said that it was difficult.  You know, he said it was difficult, you know.  He, he always felt that I was in a much better place.  He said, "Clarence, you know, you, you were the lucky one; you know, you, you found a way to do things that no oth- no--none of us--you know, any of us has, has done, so you, you were the--you--you're the lucky one."  He is a big supporter of mine ever since growing up, you know, we, we developed a good friendship. And I use the word friendship because I think that when you don't know someone despite the fact that they're your blood, you have to start by saying, well, do we like each other? And then the whole brother, family love comes later.   But the first is, do we like each other?  'Cause we don't--we were not raised together so it's not automatic.  I think in a traditional family it's automatic.  Your brother's there; you love him no matter what.  You can't stand him, but you love him.  When you, you're not around them, you have to develop that, and, and we developed that, you know.  He's aware of the interview today, and he's excited and happy that I'm being recognized in this way.
Speaker 1: Now, now does he still live in New Jersey or?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, he lives in Newark [New Jersey] now, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he's in Newark now.  What, what, what does he do for a living?
Speaker 2: Now, you got all these questions that--I did not do my research; I'm guilty.  I wanna say he works for the board of education, yeah, yeah.  I wanna say that, but I may be in trouble.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so I take it you didn't meet him until much later?
Speaker 2: I met him when I met my mother, on the same day, same day.
Speaker 1: So he'd've been about twelve or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think he was twelve years old, about two years' difference, yeah, yeah.  And at that point, I did not know he existed.  All my information was that you know, I was the youngest.  And I remember when I met him and my mother in the social worker's office, the, the receptionist said, "Oh, your name is [HistoryMaker] Clarence Waldron?"  I said, "Yes."  "Oh, is that your mother over there?"  And I looked and I said, "No, no, no, no, it's not."  "Okay, well--," she looked puzzled--she said, "okay, well, sit down for a minute and we'll be right with you," you know.  And then after a few (laughter) minutes, we're all taken back to the office and, of course, that was my mother.  But, again, my mind was my mother was the one I just left a few minutes ago in East Orange [New Jersey] to come down here.  So my mind was still my mother was my foster mother, so I wasn't thinking of this.  This is very different.
Speaker 1: Right. Okay, okay, so are you telling me that you, you actually bumped into your--I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, no, we, we, we had a meeting at--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --when we met for the first time at my social worker's office.  But what I'm saying to you, my mind was still just on the people who raised me.  So if you say that your mother was not Bertha Culver [Bertha Hill Culver], then I, I couldn't think fast enough.  Although I knew I was gonna go meet her, but my mind wasn't thinking that she'll be sitting there.  I felt that I would get an introduction.  You know what I mean?  You'll walk in and say, "Oh, by the way--," but I, I guess I came early.  She was there--she was there early and sort of threw me off for a minute 'cause I wasn't thinking that--you know, that anyone over there that I've never seen before could be my mother.  So I wasn't thinking that.
Speaker 1: So she must have seen you and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, she saw me when I first walked in.
Speaker 1: But she didn't--she--
Speaker 2: She, she, she just looked and you know, I guess she waited too.  I guess she was very nervous and scared about how this was gonna go down (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what I'm thinking, that's what I'm thinking.
Speaker 2: She was nervous too, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 663724
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about your foster parents from four months.
Speaker 2: Five months.
Speaker 1: Five months.
Speaker 2: Five months, five months, five months (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Their name--my foster mother's name was Bertha, B-E-R-T-H-A, Culver, C-U-L-V-E-R [Bertha Hill Culver].  And my foster father's name was Alexander.  Do you--do you (unclear) spell Alexander?  Culver, C-U-L-V-E-R [Alexander Culver].  They were--when I came into their lives--they were in their fifties.  They were already grandparents.  They were grandparents, so I was raised by an older, older couple.  They had several daughters, but there was one in particular that you'll hear me talk about a lot today, Catherine, Catherine with a C, C-A-T-H-E-R-I-N-E, Culver [Catherine Culver].  That was their da- oldest daughter, and she lived in the household with us.  And I had a very strong connection with the three of them that we'll, we'll talk about I'm sure as we go along, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, this is the time--now, I just--so what's the story of the Culvers?  Are they--were they, they both from New Jersey originally or--?
Speaker 2: Ohio.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Springfield, Ohio.  Yeah, and I remember they were able to celebrate their fiftieth anni- wedding anniversary in 1972.  I remember that.  We had a big family gala, and it made the local newspaper.  So it was an exciting time.
Speaker 1: So they're from Springfield, Ohio, all right.
Speaker 2: Springfield, Ohio.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So they got married in Springfield and--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --they moved to--
Speaker 2: Eventually moved to, to, to Newark first--in Newark, New Jersey, first.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then they bought a house in East Orange, New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they were one of the first blacks to live on the street.  My street I grew up on is Beech Street in East Orange.  They were probably I think the third black family to buy a house on that block, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay and, and wa- what did the--what did they do for a living?
Speaker 2: My mother was a domestic.  She, you know, cleaned houses up in the rich suburbs we call 'em, you know, West Orange [New Jersey] and South Orange [New Jersey], and Short Hills [New Jersey].  So she was a--you know, a do- domestic I guess, yeah.  She cleaned houses.  And my father was a laborer.  He worked for many, many years at the Barrett's leather company [Barrett and Company] in Newark, New Jersey.  And then he retired at some point, and then he just did odd jobs, basically delivery and packing at a grocery store in our neighborhood.  You know, that's what he just did, you know, as he retired.  It was called the Good Deal Supermarket [Good Deal Supermarkets, Inc.], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so, so did, did they like finish school and--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --(Unclear) themselves?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: They didn't.
Speaker 2: No, I, I wanna dare say my mother finished high school, but my father--I just learned this the other day from my cousin.  My father could not read.  My foster father could not read.  I didn't quite pick up on that, but I did know when I was in fifth grade [at the Nassau School, East Orange, New Jersey], I remember trying to help him with his penmanship.  I remember helping him write his name--and, "Daddy here's--let's do the A like this, L, E, X, Alex."  You know, I, I remember helping him.  I knew he could not write very well.  He could barely write his name.  I did know that.  I do know that, but I did not know until very recently, until (laughter) last week that he also could not read.  I didn't--I did not know that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that, that was probably really important, teaching him to sign his name.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: So you didn't reveal that you couldn't read by signing the X or something, you know.
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: You know (unclear). So he, he could actually put his name down.
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: So that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 663725
Speaker 1: So do you know what brought, brought them from--you know, took them east, you know, from Springfield, Ohio to East Orange [New Jersey]?
Speaker 2: You know, funny you ask that--I'm just learning another story.  And it's funny how when you stop and you do research.  And I did learn that my mother--and, again, I should say foster mother [Bertha Hill Culver], but if I don't then hopefully the, the listener can follow along.  But my foster mother, I learned that her father was believed to have been lynched in Ohio.  And actually that was--the town they told me was Middletown, Ohio.
Speaker 1: Middletown, yeah.
Speaker 2: Middletown.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That, that was a strong family rumor, secret that I was not aware of until this year, 2014.  I learned that from his granddaughter, who I call my cousin.  I just learned that.  And she talked about it very little, meaning my mother--foster mother--talked about it very little, but there was that conversation.  That's really how they got out of Ohio to come to New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there, there was actually--I'm from Dayton, Ohio.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: Middletown's where [HistoryMaker] Clarence Page is from.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: And yeah, they--and I'm very familiar with Springfield, and there was actually a man lynched in Springfield in 1917.
Speaker 2: Oh, oh?
Speaker 1: I don't know.  It's easy to find out who.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I've read about it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So there was a man lynched in Urbana [Illinois] too.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: In 1912--1911, 1912.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So that did happen in Ohio and--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --a lot of northern states there'd, there'd be a lynching every now and then--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --of someone, especially during that period they--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --call the nadir--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --how black--
Speaker 2: And I know his last name was Hill.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and my mother's maiden name was Hill.  And I wanna--I wanna say his name was Samuel, Sam Hill [Samuel Hill (ph.)], but I can check that out--but yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's--this is interesting, so--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --so that area around there like--Springfield is like between Dayton and Columbus [Ohio].  Middletown is between Dayton and Cincinnati [Ohio], almost right in the middle.  Both of them are, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But, you know.
Speaker 2: Very--yeah, that's part of the--part of our tragic side of our, our, our American history.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --'cause it's odd for a family to move east after they're west, unless it's New York City [New York, New York]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --or it's--or a big place, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but they moved close to New York.  New Jersey's--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's true.
Speaker 2: --a half an hour away, but they did not move to New York City.  But Newark was a place to be too.  New- Newark, Newark, New Jersey was thriving at that time too.  Just understand.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so this is your, your parents and--now your, your stepfather [sic.], was he--was he raised in Ohio?
Speaker 2: He was also raised in Ohio too, yes, yes.  And I, I wanna say he was actually born in Springfield.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: And that's my--that's my foster father [Alexander Culver].
Speaker 1: And so she may have been from Middletown?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, and he was from Springfield.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they married in Springfield.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That, that much we're, we're pretty clear about.  And I'm--and I'm sure the listener is, is noticing--you're noticing I know a little bit more about the family that raised me than those who did not, obviously, and, and that sort of makes sense to me.
Speaker 1: Sure, so these, these were remarkable people I would take it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 663726
Speaker 1: How many biological children did they have?
Speaker 2: They had four daughters and one son; they had five.
Speaker 1: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And they all--you know, I call them all my aunts and of course uncle, and they each, you know, played a, a key role in my life, you know.
Speaker 1: Well, well, tell us about 'em and what they, they did.
Speaker 2: Okay, I'm gonna start--I'm gonna start off with my--I have several inspirations, but I'll start off with Catherine [Catherine Culver], who was their oldest.  And we had a very good bond because, of course, she and her autistic son [Richard Culver (ph.)] lived in the household there where I was.  And Catherine--every single day growing up, I would hear the name [HistoryMaker] Katherine Dunham, the great dancer, the legendary dancer, the Katherine Dunham dancers, every single day.  Catherine, my aunt, was a dancer, and she had her own dance company called Catherine Culver and Her Dancers [sic. Catherine Culver Tropical Paradise Dancers], as Katherine Dunham was Katherine Dunham and her dancers.  And she got scholarship to go to the Katherine Dunham school [Dunham School] in New York City [New York, New York].  She was so proud of that.  She also got an additional scholarship to go to study here in Chicago [Illinois] at the Dunham School here in Chicago.  But that never happened.  She never made it to Chicago.  Her mother, my foster mother [Bertha Hill Culver], refused to let her travel that far away from home.  Our family was about, you stay home, you know.  You don't travel across country, no, no, no, no, no.  And--but she did keep her company going.  She met Louis Armstrong on the road, who encouraged the dancers.  And I wanna say she met Billy Eckstine on the road.  And, again, they, they saw the promise and said you know, it's gonna--Louis Armstrong told her--said, "Catherine, it's a long hard road in showbiz, but I can tell you and your dancers you got it, just don't give up; don't give up."  So she was on her way to what could have been a glorious career, but things did not quite go all that way, you know.  And I--and, and reason why she's my inspiration is 'cause I learned so much from that.  Between the fact that--you know, not being able to go to the Dunham School in Chicago sort of knocked her--maybe her confidence down or it did something to her spirit.  And then she also ironically--she also had a drinking problem as well so, you know, we're not sure what happened, how the company folded, but between the lack of family support--because, you know, her mother never really wanted her to be a dancer.  A dance- you're supposed to be more than that, not a dancer.  And Katherine Dunham, as, as people know, she was a very gorgeous, seductive dancer as well.  So I think that my Catherine, her mother sort of frowned upon dancing.  It just wasn't, wasn't, you know, the thing to, to do.

Speaker 1: Just in those days--just to I guess for whoever is listening to this--show dancing in a--in a club and that sort of thing was very popular and lots of dances, but, but--so the association with dancing with the club atmosphere and entertainment, you know--I mean, nowadays, dance has been like separated from the club atmos- you know.  And [HistoryMaker] Katherine Dunham is one of those pioneers that, that moved it to an arts--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --environment--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, where it's not necessarily in a club--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --where, where--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --you got--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --you know.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The good thing is my Catherine did get a chance to meet Katherine Dunham briefly, but she auditioned for her obviously.  And Katherine Dunham was nice enough to take her backstage at the Martin Beck Theatre [Al Hirschfeld Theatre] in New York [New York]--I remember these stories 'cause every day I would hear it--and would show all the costumes, and she met all the other dancers, and she knew 'em all by name and had watched them for years.  And it was a real glorious moment.  And life, life came full circle when I was able to use my resources as an entertainment editor to take my aunt Catherine to Katherine Dunham's home in New York, and they spent the entire afternoon together laughing and remembering things.  It was just an ama- ama- amazing moment.  And my aunt said, "Clarence [HistoryMaker Clarence Waldron], of all the things that I've experienced, that was it.  Spending that time with my idol, you don't understand."  I said, "Oh, Cat, I do understand," 'cause I heard those stories.  It was an amazing moment.  I remember saying, "Catherine, you ready to go home?"  She said, "No, no, I'm not."  And so we sat there and drank orange juice and ate little pastries, and just took pictures with Katherine Dunham, which I do have at least one of them here with me.  I hope to be able to share.  So it was a good moment, good moment.  But I, I guess--I guess--this is a long story.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that through studying the life of my aunt, Catherine Culver, I got my passion for what I do and what I've done, meaning she never quite reached all of her dreams.  Something happened; some- something stopped, and she was determined that I was not gonna stop.  So I remember very vividly growing up loving the music of [HistoryMaker] Dionne Warwick, who happened to be from East Orange, New Jersey, our hometown.  And Dionne came to town for a concert, and my aunt Cat came to me and says, "Clarence, your girl's coming to town." See, I heard.  She said, "I know--are you gonna go?"  I said, "Go? What do you mean go?"  "Well, don't you wanna see her?"  I said, "Cat, we can't afford money for no concerts.  You know, we don't have money for no--extra money for a concert."  And she just looked at me and said, "Yes, we do; I work every day, and that's who you love; you will go to that concert; so I'll get the, the tickets and you will go; you must go."  And like, wow.  And then--I maybe was fourteen years old.  And then from then on I learned just to follow my passion.  So her passion was Katherine Dunham, and my passion was Dionne Warwick and other, other great singers--[HistoryMaker] Nancy Wilson and Aretha Franklin.  That's who I grew up on.  It's nothing wrong with that.  We're gonna celebrate that.  It's great, great, great.  She when she, she would discuss Katherine Dunham, I'll talk about Dionne Warwick and Nancy Wilson, you know.  And we just had a great--a great relationship on that.  The key is for those listening--the key is find your--find your passion.  And because of someone encouraging me to like the music the music that I like, who let me get there, I was able to grow up to write about music, to write about the great Dionne Warwicks and Lena Hornes, the Ella Fitzgerald--phenomenal.  And it came from Catherine, my aunt, just believing that you should celebrate your passion and make it happen.
Story_ID: 663728
Speaker 1: Your aunt Catherine [Catherine Culver], you know, a tremendous influence on you and so she had a son too, as well, who's autistic--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you said.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Was that diagnosed in those days as such?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was ver- didn't know much about it but certainly, certainly.  And, again, we were two years apart, as him being in the same household he was like my little brother.  See, that's why this, this whole foster family was more than that.  That's--I, I had a little, little brother, not just some--you know, someone in the next--the next room.  I had, had a little brother.  And I think from that, the--my love for her, I also--there was a--there's a--there's a very--what's the word--sensitive side--take care of.  So I knew of his needs so I, I, I, I played big brother very well.  You know, when she was not there I would watch him and all that kind of stuff, so we have a great connection even today.  And she, she passed on.  Catherine died in 2009, and we--meaning, his--her son's cousins--and I use the word cousins--we were able to find a great adult living home for him in, in Jersey [New Jersey], and he's thriving there.  And before his mother died of cancer, we were able to show her pictures of the house where we're considering he should go, and she said, "Whatever you, Clarence [HistoryMaker Clarence Waldron], wanted to do, you and Sissy [ph.]," that's my other cousin, "fine, you know; you know, Clarence, you lead the way."  So we were able to do that, and he's doing things that he never did before.  It's amazing how well--his name is Richard [Richard Culver (ph.)]--how well Richard is, is doing, yeah.
Story_ID: 663729
Speaker 1: What about the other foster sib- siblings or your sib- (unclear)--
Speaker 2: No, you mean--
Speaker 1: That you call your aunts--
Speaker 2: Catherine's [Catherine Culver]--
Speaker 1: Yeah, her, her brothers and sisters (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's Uncle Taylor, and he is--well, he was--now, now let me get it straight now.  I know he went to Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  He was a architect.  And then, wa- as we speak right now, he is a judge in California.  And, again, you know, the family, Catherine--you know, encouraged them and helped out and all those great things.  You need--you need helpers.  You need living angels in order to make it.  So Taylor is one and--
Speaker 1: Is his name Taylor Culver?
Speaker 2: Taylor Culver, C-U-L-V-E-R.  And I remember when I was I fifth grade [at the Nassau School, East Orange, New Jersey] he gave me a Polaroid camera, he and his wife, and that led to my documenting my life and taking pictures and remembering the memories.  But also Catherine was the one who took all of our family photos.  So every photo of me as a little kid, Catherine took those pictures.  So one hand she had gave me another passion and that, that was taking pictures, but Taylor gave me the actual camera (unclear).  I'll never forget that was probably one of my fa- favorite gifts as a little kid.  So Taylor, then there's another--Catherine's other sister, Betty Washington [Betty Culver Washington (ph.)].  That's her married name, Betty Washington.  There was Dorothy Bari [Dorothy Culver Bari], B-A-R-I, and then there was Joan, Joan Ali [Joan Culver Ali], A-L-I.  And each of them played different roles in my life.  Betty--Betty was the one who was a lot like Bertha [Bertha Hill Culver], her mother, my foster mother, and she was tough.  She knew how to--she knew how to handle--ha- how to handle things.  She would--she would--she would let you know when you messing up in real blunt terms that you'll get it.  So I, I learned--the, the--there's, there's a--some of my--some of my fight, some of my fire I think came from obviously my foster mother and then also from Betty.  And my favorite times there were--they would have big barbecues.  And they lived in Orange, New Jersey [East Orange, New Jersey], and I would love to go over there because we, we have always plenty of food and you know all that great stuff.  But also they had two dogs and--Bobo [ph.] and Bruno [ph.].  Long story short, Dionne Warwick's mother [Arthur Lee Drinkard Warrick] lived around the corner--this is Orange--a house that Dionne bought her.  It's a very, very nice neighborhood.  So I would love to go to Aunt Betty's house so that I could walk her dog past Dionne's mother's house and look in to see if, if I see Dionne's limousine coming up or something like that, so great memories of, of Betty.  And also she had a lot of [HistoryMaker] Dionne Warwick records, so I remember being in her basement going through--, "Oh, my god--ooh, Dionne.  What is this one?  I don't have this one," you know.
Story_ID: 663730
Speaker 1: I guess I should ask this now, even though we haven't talked about everybody else, but, but what--what--how did you become fascinated with [HistoryMaker] Dionne Warwick?
Speaker 2: I think a lot of it was that the fact that she was from my hometown [East Orange, New Jersey].  And I think that no matter what, we're always are looking for someone to say if they can do it, I can do it.  So I think I was looking for someone--something--that I could hold onto.  I also think the fact that--again, like I said, in my household Cat [Catherine Culver] had [HistoryMaker] Katherine Dunham; my mother--foster mother [Bertha Hill Culver]--loved Nat King Cole; my cousin, Sissy [ph.], who lived in the same household, she loved Johnny Mathis, so I had to find my own thing.  So, every, every, every, everybod- every man for himself.  I found--I found Dionne when one day I heard 'Walk on By' on the radio and was in the kitchen with my other cousin.  And--, "Who is that?"  "That's Dionne.  She went to school with Uncle Taylor [Taylor Culver]--to high school [East Orange High School; East Orange Campus High School, East Orange, New Jersey]."  "She did what?"  "That beautiful--," that was it.  So, so I'm, I'm--I was gone; I was gone, yeah, yeah.  The fact that she had went to the same schools that I went to at point was, was exciting, you know, the first time we had a hometown celebrity.  You know, what I mean?
Speaker 1: Okay, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, so it started then.
Story_ID: 663731
Speaker 1: Now what about Aunt, Aunt Dorothy [Dorothy Culver Bari]?
Speaker 2: Dorothy--Dorothy, she lived in Brooklyn [New York] and then they moved to East Orange [New Jersey] later on.  She was the mother of five and they were like my sis- sisters and brothers 'cause they also were either in the same household with me for a while or like a--basically a few blocks away.  So her kids were--they're like my brothers and sisters.  Again, the word cousin doesn't quite fit, yeah, yeah.  But she'll--I don't remember much about her besides childhood days and going to her house for breakfast, and one of my brothers asking, you know, where, where were the Cheerios 'cause she always had Cheerios in her house.  It's something I just remember.  But she died young, back when I was probably--this was probably back in the '60s [1960s], '68 [1968], yeah.  And then Joan [Joan Culver Ali]--Joan lived in Brooklyn.  Joan went back to school--oh, also I need to say: all of the sisters were dancers at some point with Catherine Culver's dancers, of course.  She had her sisters dancing with her too, so all of 'em--or they would--they would replace one or--.  Bottom line, each of them could dance 'cause she taught them.  And--but Joan at some point I know she went back to, to, to school, as an adult, to get her bachelor's degree.  And she was an accountant in Brooklyn before she died.
Speaker 1: Now did she marry a Muslim?
Speaker 2: She married a man from--now, again, I'm gone get in trouble now.  Is it East India?  Yeah?
Speaker 1: Oh, oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she married--she married an Indian.  That's, that's her name.  And the other name that you heard, Dorothy Bari, she married someone named Abdul Bari--Indian.  Yeah, so those two married, married, married Indian.
Speaker 1: Actually (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There's a whole lot of Indians who lived in Newark, New Jersey at the time.  They were coming from--so a lot of--a lot of--yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and, and Joan, Joan was just also very, very proud--very proud of me and sort of pushed me.  Each, each of the sisters definitely pushed me and celebrated my, my passion for the arts and culture.  They really, really pushed that.
Story_ID: 663732
Speaker 1: 'Cause when I interviewed Dionne when I was twenty years old, a senior in college [Columbia University, New York, New York], they were like, "This is your girl, this is it."  And at that point, quite frankly, that was just the ultimate.  I could not imagine what else I could do that could be more exciting than spending an hour and a half with someone that I just admired like that.  I could not even imagine what could be better than that.  And maybe we'll get to it later on, but I did learn part of my career philosophy from that moment.  And I might as well say it now before I forget.  Things went so well with Dionne, I promised myself that I would treat everyone as if they were [HistoryMaker] Dionne Warwick, as if they were the absolutely most important person in the world during the time that I'm talking to them, and I've maintained that.  Whoever I am you can feel that I'm interested in them; you can feel that there's nothing else--there's no other place I wanna be than right here with you--Louis Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan], Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson], Al Sharpton [HistoryMaker Reverend Al Sharpton], whoever--I need to get your story told.  I'm disciplined, focused; I'm here for as long as you need me to be here.  So if you we said a half an hour, you need two hours to explain this to me, I'm here.  That came because of how Dionne treated me.  It was supposed to have been a half an hour interview at her hotel and--in New York City [New York, New York].  She was there performing with Ray Charles.  And it was supposed to be a half an hour.  We talked for an hour and a half.  And I was so nervous first time I--now that was my first published interview.  First published story was with Dionne Warwick, and I'm very, very proud of that.  And it was for the magazine called The Black Collegian.  It's a national black college magazine.  This was 1978.
Speaker 2: Yeah, The Black Collegian. [HistoryMaker] Kalamu ya Salaam (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, down in New Orleans [Louisiana] I think it was.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And so I said, you know, this is going so well.  I said (unclear) I said, "I will always remember this moment and how you're encouraging me."  And she told me, "Clarence [HistoryMaker Clarence Waldron], you know, you, you want to be more than this.  There is no top.  The top is what you want it to be, and you need to get out here and get to Ella Fitzgerald, and get to Lena Horne, and you know, you need to get to, you know, the Miles Davises and all--there's more than just me."  You know, I thought that was--just said a lot, too.  And, of course, I've done all that as well.
Story_ID: 663733
Speaker 1: Yeah, there, there are lots of celebrities from New Jersey.  We got The Isley Brothers.  We can go on and on, but, but--yeah, so--
Speaker 2: Sarah Vaughan, Sarah Vaughan from Newark [New Jersey], absolutely, yeah.  And Frank Sinatra was from I think Hoboken [New Jersey], yeah, yeah, yeah, so.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the late Imamu Baraka [Amiri Baraka], you know, spent lots of time in Newark.  I mean, he was in Newark for many, many years, and--
Speaker 2: He was still there--
Speaker 1: --was there when he--
Speaker 2: --yeah, until he died I believe.
Speaker 1: Did, did he?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, he died--
Speaker 1: I, I didn't know--
Speaker 2: --a few months ago.
Speaker 1: --if he was back in New York [New York] or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, now he died a few--just a few weeks ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, I'm glad you said that because, while Dionne [HistoryMaker Dionne Warwick] was my first published interview [in The Black Collegian], he was actually my first in person interview when I was working for public television [WNET-TV, New York, New York] as a junior [at Columbia University, New York, New York].  We met at NYU [New York University, New York, New York] where he was a professor and just to update his involvement in the Civil Rights Movement and--his involvement in human rights and those kind of causes.  So remember meeting him and he autographed his play, and--oh, gosh, I don't--the, the 'Dutchman of a Slave' [sic.]--
Speaker 1: It's 'Dutchman' [Amiri Baraka].
Speaker 2: I got it right?  Okay. (Laughter) Yeah, he autographed that for me at New York University when I was a junior, so that was my first--it was--it was a quick interview.  It wasn't--it wasn't long, but that was my first face to face interview was with, with him.  And I'm trying to reach his daughter right now because she's a radio deejay in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], and she interviewed me a year ago.  And I'm trying to find her to expose--
Speaker 1: Is that Lisa Jones, the one that writes the Spike Lee books?
Speaker 2: I don't think that's the name.  It's an unusual name.
Speaker 1: He's got some other daughters.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but either way--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: We, we, we digress.
Speaker 1: All right, yeah. Now he just did the 'Dutchman' at University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] last month.
Speaker 2: Did he?  Okay.
Speaker 1: I mean, they just--yeah, they, they--
Speaker 2: They did it--
Speaker 1: --at Court Theatre [Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 663734
Speaker 1: You really kind of provided this information but to formally ask it is--you know, when you consider your biological parents [Constance Waldron and Clarence Harris], your--the parents who raised you, and your aunt Catherine [Catherine Culver], and the other influences around you, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: That's, that's a tough one.  There are different parts of me.  You know, my passion about doing what I like to do and doing as well as I can at the time, that philosophy, that's Catherine.  I think the, the, the generous side of me, thoughtful, nurturing, come to my house, whatever you need, food, whatever, whatever, whatever, comes from my mother, but also the bite that I have.  You know, we all know you can't get somewhere being nice all the time.  I'm a nice guy, but I'm not--I'm not nice and sweet every day, not all on the same day (laughter).  So, my mother had a--had a--she was fearless.  She was fearless, and when someone would move her wrong and do her wrong, she knew how to take care of it.  So, we, we, we all joke--her name's Bertha [Waldron's foster mother, Bertha Hill Culver]; we'll call her Bertha, you know--not, not to the (unclear)--, "Oh, you're the Bertha--Clarence [HistoryMaker Clarence Waldron] pulled the Bertha out."  You know, all of us--you know, all, all of her grandkids, "Bertha--you better call upon Bertha."  And you know, that means--that means go there and kick some tail (laughter).  She was absolutely fearless.  She--no fear of, you know, white folks, anything.  She was her own person.  You know, she was--what's her face from, Shirley Chisholm, 'Unbought and Unbossed.'  You know what I mean?  She was who she is.  So I got some (unclear) in me too now.  I, I, I got a little something in me.  I know, know how to take care of things when things are not going the way they should.  My father [Waldron's foster father, Alexander Culver]--my father absolutely just--my--if, if, if you say I'm a nice guy; if you say that I'm, you know, patient with people, patient, sensitive, easygoing--easygoing side of my life, that's my father.  His big line was: "Pay it no mind."  So and so and so and so, and my--we called him dad--my daddy--, "Pay it no mind, Clarence." "I want another--." "Pay it no mind.  This is not that important."  And from him I learned things are as important as they're unimportant, so that, that whole easiness is what I, I got from him.
Story_ID: 663735
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I remember before I started school, I used to like to rake the leaves and then jump in the leaves in the front of the--of the front lawn.  I don't know what that's about, and I just would, would like that.  That's one thing that I--that I remember.  And that's it.  I just--I just remember that.  I also loved playing cards with my father [Waldron's foster father, Alexander Culver].  See, again, you know, he was an older person, so the--we--we're--we weren't doing the football and all that kind of stuff.  He, he's a grandfather, but he loved to play 500, and we, we, we, we would do that.  We would do that or watch 'Jeopardy!' with him.  You know, every day I would come home from school at lunchtime.  'Cause school was like basically around the corner, Nassau School [East Orange, New Jersey], and we'd come home and watch 'Jeopardy!'  Even to this day, 'Jeopardy!' reminds me of my father, hands down.
Speaker 1: This, this is interesting.  Now, here's, here's a man that, that couldn't read, but 'Jeopardy!' was his--wa- wa- wa- fa- favorite show.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes.
Speaker 1: So did he memorize the answers?  Did, did, did he have a--
Speaker 2: He, he, he see--
Speaker 1: --like a thirst for trying to--
Speaker 2: You know, I think--I think that was part of it.  Now that I look back at it, he wanted to learn.  He wanted to figure things out.  He wanted--you could learn by hearing things, but you may not be able to read it, but you can hear it and, and know something.  But also I knew that he wanted me to sit there so I would learn, that I would get it, or I may know that answer.  "Clarence [HistoryMaker Clarence Waldron], you know that one?  Oh, you smart.  You're so smart."  That whole thing--I was very for--I was encouraged.  "You are so smart.  You can grow up to be whatever you wanna be."  Mother [Waldron's foster mother, Bertha Hill Culver], father, Catherine [Catherine Culver], all of them, I always had that.  "Clarence, has something real special."  My mother used to say, "Clarence, you have great personality.  You're gonna do very well."  I always got that, as opposed to so many people who are raised by, you know, biological or whatever, and they get: "You ain't gone be nothing; you ain't nothing," you know, whatever.  I got just the opposite; just, "Clarence is real special."  You know what I mean?  And I know my, my mother, foster mother, before she died she said, "Clarence, you are going to do--you'll, you'll, you'll be fine.  There--there's nothing that's gonna stop you; you're gonna live a good life.  You're, you're, you're doing it now, and you, you--you're gonna be fine."  And she said that to me on, on her deathbed.  I'll never forget that.  "You're gonna be just fine.  Nothing's gonna get in the way.  You know, nothing's gonna get in the way."
Story_ID: 663736
Speaker 1: We always ask this and once again you've almost answered this too, but what was some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up [in East Orange, New Jersey] (audio disturbance)?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think I mentioned earlier just I--you would always see my mother [Waldron's foster mother, Bertha Hill Culver] cooking in, in the kitchen.  My favorite--whenever I would have--well, my birthday time.  "What'd you want for, for your birthday?"  Cake, but also spaghetti and meatballs.  So even to this day, that's my comfort food.  I'm not feeling well, give me some of that and I'm fine.  That it's--the smell of it--just the smell of the--what is it--the tomato paste.  And she'd get it from the can, you know, not the pre--you know, already made.  She'd mix it up with the onions.  Just that, that smell always was, was com- comforting to me.  I also see Christmas as a big time, a big thing to see in our, our house.  Once again Catherine [Catherine Culver] was part of bringing that joy.  She would get the lights out and she and my father [Waldron's foster father, Alexander Culver] would go up, up--out--outside with the Christmas lights.  And the little reindeer on the--on the lawn and Christmas tree.  We had the little artificial silver Christmas tree, so that and that little color thing--
Speaker 1: The color wheel with the light.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the color wheel with the light.  Oh, while, that, that, that was Christmas and always music.  There's always music--Nat King Cole.  Nat King Cole is what we would hear and, and Johnny Mathis.  Those are the two that we would play in, in, in the house, so yeah.  So, yeah, Catherine sort of brought that.  So I see Christmas as being a big--a big thing to see and feel in, in, in my--in my house, yeah.  And I have that same thing today.  I have--you know, you come to my house I may not have the big tree, but I always have gifts for everybody when they come by.  It's, it's a big deal.  It's a big deal for me.  And it's probably my--it is, is my favorite holiday.
Story_ID: 663737
Speaker 1: So the neighborhood you lived in, in East Orange [New Jersey] did it have another name--I mean, a name--a neighborhood name?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There's section called anything at all.  Like I said mine's was Beech Street, and our little saying was always, meet me on Beech Street, you know.  And my house was the--was the house to go to.  And we would sit outside on the porch and just laugh and talk about--talk about people in everyone's family kind of stuff--not play the dozens but just, just hanging out talking about what everybody's doing.  And that would be--you know, all my neighbors, and I can see Candy--
Speaker 1: So the name of the street was actually Beat Street?
Speaker 2: Beech Street is the name of the street.
Speaker 1: B-E-A-T?
Speaker 2: B-E-E-C-H, Beech.
Speaker 1: Oh, Beech.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, Beech, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, B-E-E-C-H, Beech Street.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Meet me on Beech Street.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And, and, and as a kid, all of us were, were all the homebodies.  I mean, the furthest I--the farthest I would go was maybe down the street, like maybe fifteen houses down the street.  But mostly, I was two doors--two houses or three houses from my house.  I'm either Linda Lee's [ph.] house or I'm at Candy Wilson's [ph.] house and that's it; that's it, and my mother [Waldron's foster mother, Bertha Hill Culver] liked that 'cause call--she could call my name and I could hear it even if I'm on the third floor two houses down I can hear her, so--real, close, simple kind of neighborhood, no--nobody got into any trouble, just real quiet.  Our doors were open--wide open, so, you know, you come to my house, you know, there's no reason to ring the doorbell.  My friends just walk inside, "Hey, Clarence [HistoryMaker Clarence Waldron]," call my name out, and I come downstairs or whatever so, yeah, so real comfortable, comfortable growing up.  Like I said earlier, you cannot do that now, but back then everyone's doors were wide open, literally just open.  And you could be upstairs and your door is open.
Story_ID: 663738
Speaker 1: So I take it there was a lot of music in the household, you know, growing up.
Speaker 2: Yeah, to a certain extent, yeah.  I mean--oh, and now--yeah, yeah, it was 'cause Catherine [Catherine Culver], she was a blues--so she had Dunham [HistoryMaker Katherine Dunham] dancing but the blues.  So she had--she, she used to always talk about music--playing music, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then my mother [Waldron's foster mother, Bertha Hill Culver] would--she would sing around the house some of 'The Sound of Music' and "Climb Ev'ry Mountain."  I would hear her singing, and then of course Nat King Cole was her favorite, so yeah, we'd, we'd hear a fair amount of music.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: And then of course my music too.  Don't forget I was playing my music, Dionne, Nancy [HistoryMaker Nancy Wilson] and Aretha [Aretha Franklin], yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm thinking like you were like--you were a little kid coming up at the time of when James Brown and the funk, you know, and all that.  It was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) "Sail On," "Black and Proud" ["Say It Loud, I'm Black and I'm Proud"], and--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --all that, yeah, yeah, yeah and, and James Brown was actually Cat's favorite singer, so she would buy all his records--"Papa's Got a Brand New Bag," 1965 [sic. 1966] I think it was.  I remember all that, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: But you also had this other influence.  You're describing your mother singing "Climb Ev'ry Mountain" and the Broadway show tunes.
Speaker 2: 'Sound of--,' yeah--
Speaker 1: Johnny Mathis.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Dionne Warwick and Burt Bacharach songs and all--you know--
Speaker 2: So I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you got like a whole--
Speaker 2: The--I had, had the quiet, easy listening then I had the, the soul funk, yeah, of, of James Brown around me, yeah.
Story_ID: 663739
Speaker 1: Now was the church a big factor growing up?
Speaker 2: Funny you said that.  I was never required to go to church.  My mother [Waldron's foster mother, Bertha Hill Culver] would go to church, and she would ask me to go with her sometimes, sometimes, but it was never like everybody must go to church in my house.  That's not how I was raised, which I liked that, no pressure.  I remember when I was twelve years old, she asked me, did I wanna get baptized.  And I said, "What does that mean?"  She said, "Oh, well, you're, you're, you know, giving your, your, your, your soul to the Lord and cleansing your sins."  "Does that mean I gotta be good every day?"  She said, "Yeah, you should be good every day once you're baptized."  I said, "Well, I don't wanna get baptized," (laughter), "right now.  Can we wait a little bit?  I'm only twelve years old.  Let's come back to that one--," no pressure, no conversation.  However, when I was like, fifteen, sixteen years old, when my father [Waldron's foster father, Alexander Culver] died.  I was a junior in high school [Darrow School, New Lebanon, New York].  I do know right around that time I did embrace the church.  I did join a Pentecostal church at the urging of my social worker actually 'cause she was very, very sanctimonious, but I--and I enjoyed it, where my name became Reverend Clarence.  I was (unclear) Reverend Clarence, but it was never, you know, pushed on me at all.  I have a very good spiritual center today, which is the only reason why I was--I've been able to survive what I've survived and able to be here today to talk about it.  I know that I'm--I've been well blessed beyond measure.  I do know that.
Speaker 1: Now, now did you stay a member of the Pentecostal church?
Speaker 2: Nope; no, I did not.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I did it for about a year or so and that--and that is all.
Speaker 1: Who, who is call- calling you Reverend Clarence?
Speaker 2: Oh, my friends.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, my classmates--Reverend, Reverend Clarence 'cause I'd get my Bible and go on down to the church, which was in Newark [New Jersey].  I remember--no, was it--no, it was East Orange [New Jersey]--East Orange, yeah.  But I, I, I, I, I enjoyed that, and it certainly anchored me today, you know.  It has definitely anchored me today.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, did--were the teachings of the--wa- wa- was it the teachings of the Pentecostal church or just the idea of a faith and (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah--nah, it wasn't the teaching, just this idea of knowing that God is there with you, knowing that no matter what you're going through, He will give you a way out.  That's what I remember most, and that's what--that's what I embrace today, that He is the center of everything that we do--you know what I mean--and that our blessings are tailor made.  So what's given to me belongs to [HistoryMaker] Clarence Waldron.  Your blessing can be something totally different, and that's okay.  But the key in life is recognizing your blessing, recognizing your opportunities, and knowing how to seize them.  And I think that I've done a pretty good job of recognizing when I'd been blessed.  I knew when I was a kid.  I was smart enough to know this is--this is--this is not a bad place to be.  This is not a bad place to be.  And then as I grew older and I start talking to my friends and, and then I started reading about people in foster homes and going from three to four and five different homes.  The average person that I've--that I've met--quite frankly I'll say this on the record: most people who's, who are raised in a foster or foster--in the foster care system, they've had three to five different homes.  My brothers, you know, those who, you know, were separated from the--from our, our mother--several homes, several homes at least for one of the brothers, at least three to five homes.  And in my case, I recognized that I was right here, same place, same people, to this day the bond, the love there is, is, is tremendous.  So, again, I recognized that, and I knew that I was not gonna--I did not wanna change that just because I could live with my biological mother [Constance Waldron].  That's, that was never a goal of mine.
Story_ID: 663740
Speaker 1: As your life was unfolding here is that is it's remarkable that you've been with the same foster family--I mean, you, you, you were raised from five months to--
Speaker 2: Five months old.
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: It's all I know.
Speaker 1: --which is--that's really unusual.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, and I, I just wondered--I was wondering at some point I said, well, you know, why didn't they adopt you at a certain point?  Or--I don't know what the logistics and all that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) was.
Speaker 2: --yeah, I get that a lot.
Speaker 1: And it doesn't really matter in the long run.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I think--I think at the--in the--at the same time, you know, financially, I don't think they were able to really do that.  I mean, while they, they, they were making ends meet, I think financially that really wasn't there.  Although, although I remember my mother [Waldron's foster mother, Bertha Hill Culver] coming to me and asked me did I want to be adopted and did I want to therefore change my name to Culver.  And this was maybe age twelve--twelve to fourteen.  A lot was going on.  And I told her no, I did not.  I said, "I love my name Waldron, it has a nice ring to it, and I don't wanna give that up."  So I do remember that conversation.  I also know that it was around the time that my biological mother [Constance Waldron] had appeared in my life too.  So there's that, that traditional fear.  Is Clarence [HistoryMaker Clarence Waldron] going to leave us now?  You know what I mean?  And I remember my foster mother saying to me: "Clarence, if you left to go live with your real family that would break your, your father's heart--," my foster father's [Alexander Culver] heart.  'Cause we had--we had a little saying--his nickname was Shoe.  He was a tall man, size twelve to--so his name was Shoe, Shoe.  And 'cause she said, "Because, you know Shoe just loves you."  And that was our big thing, "Shoe just loves you.  And if you left, it's, it's--he, he would--he would just die," kind of thing, and she meant that.  And all those around him--Cat [Catherine Culver] say it too.  "Daddy just loves you."  You know what I mean?  So, that--yeah.  But anyway, but no--but that--that's come up.  But, but--
Speaker 1: Oh, no, you don't have to stop right there.
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm gonna tell you the story.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But I think things work out as they should.  Things work out as they should.
Story_ID: 663741
Speaker 1: We discussed my family inspirations, but I do wanna tell you about my, my first school teacher who mattered to me, who really to me, turned it all around.  When I was in fifth grade, her name was Mrs. Neals, Betty Neals.  Neals is spelled N-E-A-L-S.  And I remember being in fifth grade and I was actually--believe it or not--I used to get in a little bit of trouble in the classroom.  I'll--I had--I would have a few tantrums for no reason.  I knew that I was a little more advanced than most students in the class, so I'd get bored easy and I may, you know, yell something out or, or I would tantrum--I'll scribble on my desk in second grade or third grade.  This teacher I later learned heard about this, and she asked that I be in her class in fifth grade--now I want that one.  And of course she knew the foster child.  She all--she knew that, and she was everyone's favorite teacher.  We only had maybe two black teachers at that time, so she was my first black teacher.  And she--when I was looking back at it--she basically was the mother role.  She was everything ideal.  She was educated, she was beautiful, she was intelligent, she was nurturing, she was patient, and she said this to me one time.  She said--and she talks, even to this day 'cause I'm very in touch to this day--she talks like [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou, that kind of, you know, ele- you know, real, real, real, real proper and smooth and dramatic and, and all that great stuff.  But anyway, she said to me--she said to me, "What do you think you should get on your next report card?"  And I'm like, "Oh, well, you know, a C in math and maybe a D in reading and--," you know, stuff like that.  And, and I remember looking down, looking around, all over, and not looking at her.  And she said to me, "Is that what you think that you deserve, Clarence [HistoryMaker Clarence Waldron], Clarence?"  I said, "Yeah."  She said "Okay, go, go, go, go sit down, go sit down," so I did.  A week later report cards came out and I had straight A's and a B in gym, physical education, but straight A's.  And all of a sudden the lights went on in my mind and in my soul that I am intelligent, that it's okay to embrace that, that you are smart, so it's okay.  Get your self-esteem together.  And that's when I began to believe that I was, as Jesse [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] would say, I was somebody.  I did something special going on here.  I'm not run of the mill.  You know, I'm more than just the foster child around the corner, and it came from being in her class at that time.
Speaker 2: So that--so you're actually speaking to the importance of having a, a black teacher on some level, who--not just any black teacher, but someone who could recognize something in you that other teachers didn't.
Speaker 1: Absolutely, yeah, that was my--that was my first black teacher.  The only--'cause they only had two there, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I just think life is very simple.  If you can find someone who can tell you that you can do it, then probably--you probably can do it.  It's just almost as simple as that--someone who can boost your self-esteem, and that, that--that's, that's what she did, so all of a sudden, you know, I knew I was fine then.  I knew--
Speaker 2: So, so--
Speaker 1: --and, and I--and also all the trouble that I used to get into, never any trouble in her class--never any trouble in her class.
Speaker 2: What was the name of your, your first--is--was, was this your first school--elementary school?
Speaker 1: Yeah, el- element- yeah--Nassau, N-A-S-S-A-U, Nassau School in East Orange [New Jersey], and this is my fifth grade teacher.  And she really turned my, my, my life around, and she also did something else that was--that, that again--again, she understood--all right, foster child, okay, living with--in, in a home where no one looks like him.  We, we look--you know, (unclear) different last names.  I think she got that Clarence just needs a little attention; just make him stand out, and we all stand out.  So she knew or she heard, or we all--we all knew [HistoryMaker] Dionne Warwick, so during--we used to sit in a circle and read stuff.  She would sing Dionne Warwick songs to me, yeah.  And the song was 'Message to Michael.'  And I've told Dionne this story too, and we laugh about it.  She was singing 'Message to Michael' and changed it of course to, "Message to Clarence--message to Clarence, message to Clarence; tell him I love him so."  And again, just that, you know, belief or celebration of me.  I said, wow.  And, you know, we talked about Dionne Warwick even in, in the fifth grade.  You know what I mean?  And it--and it definitely calmed me down--so again, someone who cares.  So when I hear from people parents today and their kid is having a hard time or this or that, I say, all they need is a Mrs. Neals.  "All your son needs or your daughter is a Mrs. Neals," you know, and, and black first I think, and just someone who's patient and nurturing.  That's the first thing--who'll take the time to make sure that you're doing the best that you can do, and she did that and did it very well.
Story_ID: 663742
Speaker 1: So fifth grade, ten years old.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now this is--now ten is--
Speaker 2: Or maybe eleven.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, well, yeah, ten or eleven (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was 1968, I know that.
Speaker 1: Sixty-eight [1968], okay.
Speaker 2: Sixty-seven [1967], '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah you're ten--ten or eleven, I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I even have my report card from fifth grade still.  I, I, knew to ca- I knew to save it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right, so did you have like a middle school or a junior high school?
Speaker 2: Yep, I went to a junior high school VLD, V--the letters V-L-D as in David, Vernon L. David Junior High School [sic. Vernon L. Davey Junior High School, East Orange, New Jersey], and we called it VLD.  So I, I did, did the two--yeah, seventh, eighth grade there, and then I went to our local high school, East Orange High School [East Orange Campus High School, East Orange, New Jersey].  And I did--
Speaker 1: Well, well, just, just a minute--
Speaker 2: I'm sorry; sorry.
Speaker 1: --before we go any further, I just wanna have a sense of what the demographics of the school population were when you--it wa- was this mostly--were these most- mostly black students with you in school?
Speaker 2: By the time we got to junior high school, it was 95 percent--9- 95 percent black.
Speaker 1: But in elementary school [Nassau School, East Orange, New Jersey]--
Speaker 2: Elementary it was very mixed.  It was mixed.  I would say--I would say by the time I was fifth grade, there was more like 80 percent.  The, the city was changing.  The city was changing, yeah.  Although when I entered in kindergarten, you know, they were white teachers for sure, and it was--it was a more of a mixed, mixed demographic.
Speaker 1: Had, had there been a Jewish, neigh- neighborhood before?  I was thinking of the name Ve- Vernon L. David, you know.
Speaker 2: You know, I think that it really was.  You know, I think that it really was 'cause most of the doctors and the businesses, like Kosher (Unclear), where we would get our hotdogs were, were, were, were, were Jews, yeah, yeah, yeah; I think it was, yeah, yeah.  And I know that my block that I grew up on there were a lot of white families there in the beginning, in the beginning days, in the late '50s [1950s].
Story_ID: 663743
Speaker 1: Anything significant happen or any significant teachers or role models in junior high school [Vernon L. Davey Junior High School, East Orange, New Jersey]?
Speaker 2: Nothing real- no one really stood out there as much, no.  I mean, I, I, I liked school; I did well in school; but there was a favorite teacher at that point.
Speaker 1: Now, now what about activities?  At this age a lot of students get involved in Boy Scouts [Boy Scouts of America] and maybe in the Boys Club [Boys Clubs of America; Boys and Girls Clubs of America] or the--get a job or, or--you know, did you do any of those kind of activities?
Speaker 2: I know I did the year book when I was high school [East Orange High School; East Orange Campus High School, East Orange, New Jersey]--I mean, jun- junior high school.  I did the year book.  I think by the time I could work was at sixteen years old you could work.  I had a job at the East Orange City Hall [East Orange, New Jersey].  I worked for the police department.  And this is--you know, whatever year--at sixteen years old I guess, whenever I could work, my first was--
Speaker 1: Six--yeah.
Speaker 2: --yeah, was working for--within this East Orange City Hall.  Somehow I wound up in the East Orange Police Department juvenile--juvenile division.  And I got so interested in juvenile delinquency that I wrote a paper for high school that I'm--actually that paper led to a front page story on a local newspaper called the East Orange Record where they interviewed me.  They took quotes from my thing, and they did it all about me and had my picture in the front page of The New York Times.  And--
Speaker 1: So this is when you were sixteen?
Speaker 2: Sixteen years old, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And the (unclear) I was pointing out--you know, the (unclear) was: why do some kids get in trouble and some don't?  And so that's, that's what it was.  And it--I don't know how it got to the East Orange Record.  I don't know who called them, but I know I have that story today and with--and not with me today, but I, I have it in my collection, yeah.
Speaker 1: What was the substance of, of your findings at age sixteen?
Speaker 2: You know, I remember in- interviewing a detective named Detective William Reeves [William E. Reeves, Jr.].  And it was a classic story of most kids not having a father in the home, most kids wanting attention, that we all thrive for attention, and no matter what--matter what you say when you get in trouble, your mother's mad at you; the father you never had may pop up.  So again, it was this whole idea of a lack of love, lack of attention.  See, and, again, that's the thing that Mrs. Neals [Betty Neals] made sure that I had attention, you know.  And I, I had it at home as well, but, you know, that made it--I think that all of that makes a difference.  I think kids who don't see any hope, who are bored--then let's, let's get in some, some stuff here, and no matter what I'll, I'll get some attention this way, the wrong way.
Speaker 1: Now this is interesting because we know from what we said previously that you had just met your biological mother [Constance Waldron] and brother at age fourteen, so that's two years before.  Then you worked for the police department you--and, and I, I guess this is (unclear) like why do--like, I'm here now.  I could have been there.  How--is that--what--
Speaker 2: I wonder--I wonder about was there a connection on how things could have gone with--if you're not given the proper tools.  It, it may happen.  It may happen.  It may have been, you know, you know, related to just seeing differences in, in, in, in people's lives, you know.  You know, you know, not saying that, you know, you know, growing up on a nice street makes you, you know, a great person because that's not--that's not what I'm saying but, but having a quiet nurturing environment--household--makes a--makes a big difference, and also knowing, knowing that you're loved for sure.  And, you know, I felt I know that I came from a, a loving home between--you know what I'm saying--(unclear) Bertha [Waldron's foster mother, Bertha Hill Culver] and, and Shoe [Waldron's foster father, Alexander Culver], you know, mommy and daddy and Cat [Catherine Culver], I was--I was pretty good, pretty good.
Speaker 1: Now, now did you start to--I mean, I guess when, when you, you, you--I would imagine you, you were thinking deeply about your mother's situation and maybe how--you know, what influenced her, you know, and, and did, did, did you--like, in, in, you know, going to the police department, did you see the larger picture of, of what influences us to, to do one thing or another?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I think--I think the environment, poverty, you know, not knowing much about her mother, and from what I understand there was dysfunction there as well, that she was not a role model mother, and maybe her kids should have been taken away from her.  I don't know.  I'm, I'm not gonna judge that, but no.  So, her, her, her examples were not strong.  I do know that much.  You know, she did not come from, you know, a solid, loving foundation.  That's for sure.
Speaker 1: And so, so the conclusion of--I mean, your article indicates that the, you know, conditions create consciousness or create activ- I don't know--behavior (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah absolutely, absolutely.
Story_ID: 663744
Speaker 1: Well, you wouldn't think this would be rocket science today, but it seems like newspapers are constantly discovering this or, or every generation's got to discover it over and over again.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, and it almost still is news.  And I guess my--I guess what they must have been impressed with that I was a sixteen year old kid and I observed this.  I understood this.  I saw it in some of my peers in school [East Orange High School; East Orange Campus High School, East Orange, New Jersey].  I could see the difference.  I guess that was part of it too.  And, again, like even today whenever I talk to young people, I love to hear where, where they are.  And the ones who can explain to me what's happening, why they're doing what they do, those are the ones that I wish we could hear more about in the media.  There're some very intelligent young, young folks that we don't think are out there.  And I just spoke to a group last week, and they all are opinion writers.  They, they did a little program where they're learning how to shape their opinion to be thought leaders.  And they said how this three month program changed their life, how they are confident now, that they can say what they wanna say and have evidence to back it up.  And I was like, look at you guys.  This is the stuff that I wish the media would, would cover more.  You know what I mean?  You know, you're, you're bright; you're able to express yourself.  You know, we need to hear more, more from you guys, yeah.
Speaker 1: This is also a period.  Now this is--this is interesting because I--I'm thinking like the--it's usually from our religious leaders we get the notion that some people are good and some people are evil.  They--you can choose to be one or the other--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --regardless of your circumstances, you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you're going to Pentecostal church, which sharpens these distinctions--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --more than any other church probably.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: You're either good or bad.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Or, you, you can--you can choose Jesus or you can choose the devil.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know, so were you--so did--I mean--so you--you're battling with a lot of different influences at, at this point and you're--but the article [in the East Orange Record] seems to reach a conclusion that it's environment that--
Speaker 2: Is it--yeah, the article definitely was environment based.  Yeah, it's that what goes on in your home, home or in your neighborhood, you know, makes--will make--will make the difference, yeah, definitely.
Story_ID: 663745
Speaker 1: So this is in high school, so you're--you know, pretty much at sixteen you're--you're--you sound like you're done with high school (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well (laughter)--
Speaker 1: 'Cause you (laughter), you reached a, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, our funny--after that, that was a big year for me 'cause after that story ran [in the East Orange Record], I was able to get a scholarship to go to a college prep boarding school.  So I did my junior and senior year at a, a college prep school called Darrow, D-A-R-R-O-W, School [Darrow School] in Upstate New York, a little town called New Lebanon, New York, about an hour from Albany, New York.  And I did my junior and senior year there, and my whole world really changed then.  My whole world really changed then because I was no longer the high honor roll student that I was back in my public school, East Orange High School [East Orange Campus High School, East Orange, New Jersey].  I was now competing with the, the smart white kids, so to speak.  And the third thing is my--it's my first time away from home.  So--
Speaker 1: Yeah, now this is also the--your father [Waldron's foster father, Alexander Culver] just passed away, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, you, you caught that?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: He just passed away too, so this is really a time of a lot of--
Speaker 2: He died in June, and I'm sitting at the new boarding school in September.  And that--and that--and it's so funny how that happened.  And I did not wanna go.  I did not wanna go.  I felt that my job was to be the man of the house and stay there and take care of my mother [Waldron's foster mother, Bertha Hill Culver], and Cat [Catherine Culver], and her son [Richard Culver (ph.)].  Um-hm, they're not having that.  "You gonna go to this school (makes sound)--," and--but I think ironically, how life goes, I wondered if my father was alive if I would have accepted it.  There's a great part of me that just--you know, my attachment to him, I don't think that I would have gone.  But see, again, spirit has a way of doing things.  Spirit has a way of saying, we're gonna take this out to make room for this, you know, that type of thing.  I don't think that I would have gone.  You know, I don't think that I would have gone, but I did go.  I did go, and I was encouraged to go and did well, and--
Speaker 1: Now who--well--
Speaker 2: Yeah, go ahead--
Speaker 1: Well, just I, I didn't ask you, like, who, who set this up or what, what group of--
Speaker 2: Here we go.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It's, it's a program called A Better Chance.  There's--they are celebrating their fiftieth anniversary right now, 2013, 2014.  And what they do, they find talented minority students, and they send them to private schools or college prep boarding schools.  And they've been doing this since the '60s [1960s], and it's a great program.  So they gave me the scholarship.  How did I hear about it?  From the same social worker who got me involved with that Pentecostal church.  She said, you know, you--, "You're doing so well, Clarence [HistoryMaker Clarence Waldron].  You know, wouldn't you wanna go away to school?"  And of course I said, "No, I do not."  "Well, Clarence, would you mind if we at least fill this application out?"  And of course she talked to my mother and, you know.  And she--mom said, "Well, we'll fill it out," so I did and, and got in, and it changed my world.  It really, it get--
Speaker 1: I just wanted to, to make--I, I, I hadn't like caught onto this until now, but I guess as a foster child in a--in a home, you had to have periodic visits with the social worker.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, so they were always involved in--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I hated that.  I hated that as a kid.  I was just embarrassed.  Who was--especially I, I, used to have white ones first--white social worker, but this was--this is for my--remember--her name was Ms. Alligood [ph.]--might as well, you know, tell Ms. Alligood, A-L-L--I think it was A-L-L-I-G-O-O-D, believe it or not.  I think there's an I in there.  Her mean Alligood--I have not seen her since 1973, but--
Speaker 1: So you--if you were writing this, you know--I mean, you couldn't use her name.  It would be too obvious that it was--she's gonna do good if her name is Alligood.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I like--I like--oh, I like that.  But anyway, she was the one who heard about the program.  She was the one who came to me and said, "Do you want--do you wanna meet your mother [Waldron's biological mother, Constance Waldron]?"  You know what I mean?  And so she was very active.  She really, really took a lot of time.  And she was the only one that I remember by name.  There were some ones before her, and I'm sure there was someone after her.  I don't remember anyone else besides that one--yeah, Ms. Alligood, yeah.
Speaker 1: This is all kind of speaking to the importance of African Americans pursuing these professions and getting there.  You said you--this is your first African American social--
Speaker 2: That I can remember, absolutely.
Speaker 1: And she's the one--
Speaker 2: And she was thorough.  Again, you see?  The school teacher [Betty Neals]--thorough care.  There's potential here.  This a diamond; it's rough maybe, but there's--I believe in it.  I'm not quite sure whether, you know, the, the other side really believed--believes enough in, in those days in what black chil- children could do.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's--
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: --not to say a white person couldn't do it, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --it's important to have some black people in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's very important 'cause when I say when I got in her class [at the Nassau School, East Orange, New Jersey], the tantrums, that attention getting, all that stopped.  And then she said--she even says today: "I don't really--I remember hearing about that, but we never had a problem there."  'Cause I would tell her--with [HistoryMaker] Dionne Warwick--so she used to sing your songs to me to calm me down 'cause I was so bad.  She said, "Clarence, you were not bad.  You were not bad in my class," and I guess I really wasn't.

Speaker 1: So A Better Chance--
Speaker 2: A Better Chance, great program.  It's still out there now--
Speaker 1: Yeah, we did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and hopefully parents--
Speaker 1: --Sylvester--
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: You know Syl- you know, Sylvester from Chicago [Illinois] who is out in California now who is involved in A Better Chance for--
Speaker 2: No, I don't (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) a writer who--
Speaker 2: Was he--
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: --Monroe?
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Sylvester Monroe.
Speaker 2: I did not know that.  We would work together.  You know that?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay, okay, yeah.
Speaker 1: He's another student that went through--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --A Better Chance.
Speaker 2: A Better Chance.
Speaker 1: He grew up in the projects here [Robert Taylor Homes, Chicago, Illinois], you know.
Speaker 2: You know who also went A Better Chance?  Barack Obama's best friend from Chicago, Marty Nesbitt [HistoryMaker Martin Nesbitt].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: He's, he's the godfather of the--of the kids [Sasha Obama and Malia Obama].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he spoke at our fiftieth anniversary fundraiser here in Chicago in 2013.
Speaker 1: He has The Parking Spot [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly, great program.  So I hope that people who are looking at this, parents and, or children could look into it.  And Better Chance, I think they're based in Boston [Massachusetts] or New York [New York] now, but you can Google anything and you'll see A Better Chance--great program, great program.
Speaker 1: So the name of the school tipped me off.  I mean, did you have an I--any idea who Clarence Darrow was?
Speaker 2: No, I had no idea at all, no idea at all, no idea at all, you know.  And we, we never--and it's funny, we'd never been taught anything about, about him at all.  This was just the name of a school [Darrow School, New Lebanon, New York].  We didn't--we didn't think twice about it, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: He, he was a defender of the Scottsboro Boys and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --a great social activist--
Speaker 2: I write--yeah.
Speaker 1: --lawyer.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, and the headmaster of this prep school, I learned just recently would act- actively recruit black and Hispanic students.  And there's another program--and I, I can't remember the name.  It's very similar to A Better Chance in New York.  And he would visit that program.  "Do you have some talented kids to send me?" And so he was very open to that.
Story_ID: 663747
Speaker 1: So tell us about your first experience at Darrow School [New Lebanon, New York].  I mean, did--did you go there with somebody or did you go by yourself, or did somebody meet you?
Speaker 2: Oh gosh. 'Cause remember, Darrow School is probably about five hours from home [East Orange, New Jersey]--first time away from home.  I think I want to tell you--did my case worker bring me up there?  No, no, she did not; she did not; she did not.  I wanna say my two cousins--I have a cousin, Sissy [ph.], that I mentioned to you, who's a judge in Jersey [New Jersey], and her husband, who--her late husband, who was a doctor, those were my other living angels.  And I know they embraced this whole Darrow preps thing--thing--they would come up there to meet with the teachers during the parents' weekend.  They played mom and dad.  Remember now, my foster mother [Bertha Hill Culver] is much older now, and she didn't drive, so that would have been a big thing.  But her granddaughter, who I call Cousin Sissy, and, and her husband Ron [ph.] they did all that.  So I think they drove me up there 'cause I know they would come pick me up to bring me home during the, the holidays.  And they would drive up there to, to get me.  They were instrumental because they knew that I was gone be competing with white folks for the first time.  And they said, "You gotta--you gotta come prepared and ready, so you gotta--you gotta look the part.  It's all in presentation, Clarence [HistoryMaker Clarence Waldron].  So, no, you can't go up there with this raggedy piece of luggage.  We must buy you--," I guess it was Samsonite was a popular name they--, "We gonna buy you something decent, not this stuff from, you know, the thrift store.  You know, we, we--this is a new world for you."  They also said, "You gotta have an electric typewriter, not just a typewriter.  You gotta--you gotta come there with the tools to compete.  So we know you can com- compete, but do you have the tools?"  And, and they were right.  Most of the black kids did not have a typewriter, so they would have to borrow from classmates or whatever.  So I came there--I came there ready to roll.  So I appreciate them for that, you know, being, being my role model, in terms of education and all that good stuff.  I could--I could see where it could lead to.  I could see that it, it, it, it ha- it had a good ending if you--if you allow yourself to work hard; if you get through the whole educational process, there is a rainbow at the end of the whole process.  I could see them in their--in their lives just watching them.
Speaker 1: I'm just thinking here that you had like a double boost in a lot of ways, because you came from a home where a college education was, you know, normative in a sense, but because you were a foster child, you had a chance to go to this prep school.  But had you not been a foster child in this home, you might not have been able to go--
Speaker 2: Who knows?
Speaker 1: --'cause you, you wouldn't have qualified for the prep school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I don't know that--
Speaker 1: --through A Better Chance.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I--and I think that that was--that was my qualifying thing, you know--you know, income--family income and then, you know, foster child.  That definitely mattered.  But I had a lot of my other black, you know, classmates.  They didn't come from that.  They, they were not foster children, but they came from a low social economical background--economic background for sure, yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, okay, interesting, so.
Story_ID: 663748
Speaker 1: Any rate, so what was--what--well, go ahead.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so again, again, it's even at that age recognizing a gift, recognizing a great op- opportunity.  Although I did not wanna go, I knew that this could--this could--this could put me ahead--'head of the game.  So again, recognizing, you know, when there's a blessing there, recognizing when there's an opportunity.  And I had for--I was fort- fortunate to have people who pushed me to recognize that.  So while I didn't wanna go and I'm sitting there crying, though when I came home for Thanksgiving, I vowed not to go back.  And these two cousins, Sissy [ph.] and her husband, "You, you must go back.  Clarence, if you just go back and if you don't like it, you know, another month we promise, you know, you come on home, but you gotta go back."
Speaker 1: I'm sensing it was like a culture shock or it wa- wasn't that positive of an experience in the beginning.
Speaker 2: It was everything.  I mean, I'd never been around white folks before outside of the few in kindergarten [at the Nassau School, East Orange, New Jersey], that type of thing.  And I never--I never got a C before, so to speak.  You know what I mean?  I was no longer the, the high honor roll kid.  So I was like, what is going on here?  I'm [HistoryMaker] Clarence Waldron (laughter), don't you--don't you recognize?  I'm from East Orange, New Jersey.  Wait--what did I get on this math project, you know.  So it was a different thing.  But what it did, it gave me a, a heads up, so by the time--and we'll get to this in a minute--by the time I got to college, I was very comfortable, whereas my friends who stayed in the public school [East Orange High School; East Orange Campus High School, East Orange, New Jersey] back home, you know, they went through a big culture shock at freshman year of college.  Whereby then I knew I was not gonna be the only one with an A or I may not get that A.  I got that.  I learned that two years earlier at, at, at the prep school, yeah.  Yeah, it's different.  It was different.
Speaker 1: Well, who were--were there any particular mentors, or, or, or role models in--at Darrow.
Speaker 2: At, at Darrow School [New Lebanon, New York]?
Speaker 1: Yeah?
Speaker 2: There was--there was--there was a--there was a couple, Carole [Carole Johnson] and Paul Johnson, and they--I don't whether it was a formal thing, but they were like the (air quotes) advisors to the minority students.  And they were very encouraging.  One of my--well, my best friend that I've known for forty years who I met there, Anita [Anita Jenkins], you know, they, they just took her under their wing and nurtured her and encouraged her to apply to the big name schools as they did with me.  So they said, "No, you need to apply to Columbia University [New York, New York]" 'cause we had another student who got there last year.  "Clarence, you should--you should go there, you know," you know.  And I, I applied to other ones as well, but they were very encouraging.  And I think they were advisors to the minor- minority students--very, very sensitive and helpful.
Story_ID: 663749
Speaker 1: The other culture shock was also wardrobe for me too.  I mean, the stuff that I was wearing wasn't quite what they were wearing.  And I remember my friend, Anita [Anita Jenkins], saying, "Clarence [HistoryMaker Clarence Waldron], those little sneakers you got, we got to go into town and get you some better than that."  'Cause I came with something.  I don't know the name of 'em, skippy's.  They were just some generic brand, and she said, "You at least gotta have Converse All-Star now; you're in a new league."  And I remember that as the biggest joke.  "You can't wear that East Orange [New Jersey] (laughter), whatever y'all call that--not up here."  I remember she was like my fashion person.  So it is a culture shock, what to wear and how to--how to fit in, in, in the--in the classroom and how to compete.  It, it, it's--it was a different world going to the--to the prep school [Darrow School, New Lebanon, New York], yeah.
Speaker 2: So did you have--what was--what subject area was the most challenging, in terms of catching up?
Speaker 1: Math.  There was some little joke.  The, the professor or teacher was saying something and tried to show me this on the--on the board, and, and the whole class was laughing, but I don't--I had no idea what he was talking about even to this day.  But, yeah, math was hard for me.  It--back at home it was easy, but I got there and it, it was--it was a different world.  It was a different world, yeah.  But I did well in English lit--English obviously.  Eng- English literature and all that came to me quite well.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It was a different thing.  But I must say something to you.  (Unclear)--in terms of their adjustment to going away for the first time, my biological mother [Constance Waldron] and my biological--biological siblings were very supportive.  And I would call home collect; I'd call the family that raised me collect; I'd call my biological mother collect 'cause that's how--that's how--that's how you call long distance back then.  And they were always there for me.  I must say that.  So my, my, my biological mother and I, we really developed a strong bond during, during my prep school days.  You know, she, she was supportive.  She was excited and proud that her son was doing that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And it also made her feel as if she did the--things worked out well and that she did the right thing in a sense.  I think it sort of helped her feel like (simultaneous)--
Story_ID: 663750
Speaker 1: Now I gotta backtrack again 'cause I, I never really asked you about what happened at that initial meeting.  We had you in the office of the social worker.  Your mother's [Waldron's biological mother, Constance Waldron] sitting out there, and you know, this is the first time you've ever seen her--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --at age fourteen.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What was the first conversation like?
Speaker 2: She was very quiet.  She was very quiet.  I don't remember what she said--more like, you know, nodding her head a lot.  She seemed like she was very embarrassed, very uncomfortable, wasn't quite sure what I was gonna say, so she was letting me lead the way.  So I remember the case worker said, "Oh, so this is your brother.  Did you know that you had a younger brother?"  "No, I did not know."  I didn't know I had a brother.  And I looked at her and you know it was like, you know, discomfort like--she didn't--she didn't say much.  It was more like nodding her head, nodding the head.  You know, "What happened?"  "Oh, I, I, I don't wanna talk about that."  And we never really had that conversation.  And, you know--you know, as I got to know her, I pushed it more, you know.  Again, like I said, I'm nice and sweet but not always on the same day (laughter).  I wanted to know something--some answers, and I got a few of them, but not--I, I got enough to close it.  I got enough for closure's sake.  Just let it be only because I knew that I was doing okay.  I knew that it benefited me that I knew that this was working out, and I knew that God planned it this way for a reason.
Speaker 1: Now, now did she take the initiative and, and maintain the relationship or did you?
Speaker 2: Absolute--no, no, she, she, she was all over--all over calling a lot, and dinners, and come down, you know, to Newark [New Jersey] for dinners all the time.  And all the neighbors, "This is my son, Clarence [HistoryMaker Clarence Waldron], and he was in the front page of the East Orange newspaper [East Orange Record]," and she, she did all, all of those things.  He's so smart.  So she was very proud of me for sure--you know, for sure and all my siblings, you know.  I have a sister, Joyce [Joyce Arnold], you know--again, you know, very proud.  And I'm very happy to say that I got to know my siblings, you know, well--to this day well.  And we even did a, a Waldron family cruise to Mexico.  The Waldrons hanging out together.  They don't know each other, but we do know each other--beautiful moment.  One of my best times was, you know, being on that cruise with them, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, what a year, though, 1971 mus- must have been for you.
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) There was a whole lot going on, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Whole lot going on.  Now the cruise was years later of course.
Speaker 2: Yeah, of course, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but now there's a lot (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Year, when you were sixteen was the--
Speaker 1: And, and I wondered, you know, why I didn't break.  I wondered why I just didn't say, you know, forget this.  You know what I mean?  I don't know what kept me on, on board.  Again, it had--it had to be God.  It had to be something in me that said this is supposed to happen, and you're gonna make this all worthwhile someday, you know.
Story_ID: 663751
Speaker 1: And then going to the prep school [Darrow School, New Lebanon, New York] and seeing other people who were as talented as I was who came from a similar background, that helped too, because up there we had to share stuff.  "So where are you from?"  "Okay, what--your mother--oh, no, you were raised by a relative.  Okay, well, I wasn't raised by a relative, but I was--," so all of that was more prevalent up there, 'cause it had only like maybe ten black kids in the total school.  So bonded and we, we were sharing some ma- you know, mature conversations back then that I did not do back home.  Because everybody back home we looked the same, we're all in the same environment.  There's a comfort zone.  But up there we really had to share our roots and had to accept things, accept the way that life is, accept (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sort of galvanized that group.
Speaker 1: Hm?
Speaker 2: That it, it galvanized you all up there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, we all--you know, of course, as you can imagine, all the black students sat together (laughter), you know.  Yeah, we had a little black student union room, you know, on, on the campus.  So, yeah, all that made me know how important unity was too.  'Cause when you at a black high school, everybody's just the same and you don't think it, but I, I valued it.  You know, I valued my people more.  I valued me more.  I understood the difference between black and white in America.  I, I saw it.  I learned--I learned it there for sure.
Speaker 2: And not just the negative connotation of it though the positive--
Speaker 1: The positive too.  I, I, I had white roommates who were--you know, we are--we are good--great friends and all that stuff, but yeah, just the, the, the, the differences in, in life.  I mean, I never saw a Rolls-Royce before.  You know, I mean, one of my students came in there with a Rolls--one of my classmates came in a Rolls-Royce, stuff like that.  You know, not knowing, you know, what to wear and not knowing, you know, quality clothing.  I did not know anything about that at all until I got there, you know, so a little bit different.
Speaker 2: Okay, well, did the school have like a social activist kind of spin to it, being a Darrow--I mean, named after Clarence Darrow?
Speaker 1: Nothing at all. Oh, I'm sorry; no, no, no, what, what we did is not social act- we had something called: Hands-to-Work, hearts to God.  Where this school was, was built on the Shaker--the Shaker foundation, the Shaker tradition.  So they, they were traditionally old buildings that were built by the Shakers.  So we had to, you know, do things with our hands.  We had to fix things.  We had to go out to the--to the--to the woods and, you know, clean up and stuff like that, so we worked with our hands 'cause the Shakers built everything.  All the, the buildings and the furniture was Shaker furniture.  So that was different for me too, that little, little slice of another kind of history.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, so, so was the school actually--well, I'm, I'm sure it wasn't founded by the Shakers, but it was on, on property that the Shakers--
Speaker 1: Once owned, yes.
Speaker 2: Once owned.
Speaker 1: Yes, and they followed some of their Shaker traditions, yeah.
Speaker 2: I, I think they, they don't have children or don't get married or anything.  I think they, they--so they basically die out once they form a group of Sha- Shakers and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I, I don't know.  I don't know--I don't know that.  Maybe so.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think they, they live (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Maybe so.
Speaker 2: --through their lifetimes and that's it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 663752
Speaker 1: Well, you were there [Darrow School, New Lebanon, New York], there two years (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Two years, junior and senior year, yes.
Speaker 1: You, you graduated in '75 [1975], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So the last couple of years you were there '74 [1974] and '75 [1975] (unclear) those were the--Watergate was going on I think--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in '74 [1974]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and there was a--so what was it--what else was in the news then.  Were you--were you paying attention to it as a--had you pitched yourself in our mind as a journalist at that point?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, at that point I thought that I would go to college and major in sociology.  And I guess with my background I wanted to make sure that I was the best social worker that I--that a young kid could use, and that's, that's what I thought.  So the news, I--I'm ashamed to tell you I was not reading the newspaper.  Of course, I remember Watergate.  I remember Barbara Jordan testifying and her faith in the [U.S.] Constitution was whole, complete, and total.  I remember that.  I remember quote--I said oh, my god, who is this great woman from Texas?  But Watergate, I remember that (unclear), but nothing really else that I remember standing out that I was following or--'cause it was all over the news with Watergate, but not much more.  So I was not thinking as a journalist at that young age.  I was more in- interested in, in theater.  I wanted to be an actor at that time, so I was involved in a lot of plays on campus, you know.
Speaker 1: What, what plays were going on and what roles did you play?
Speaker 2: They, they, they were things that was like written by other students and, you know, that, that kind of thing.  However, there was a play that I wanna say the name of the play is--with the song "Mack the Knife" comes from.
Speaker 1: Oh, 'Threepenny Opera' ['The Threepenny Opera,' Bertolt Brecht], yeah.
Speaker 2: Un-huh, here's my lesson.  I don't remember the, the storyline.  All I know that I have proven myself to be this great actor.  All the kids loved me--the teachers, "Oh, my, [HistoryMaker] Clarence Waldron--fantastic."  You know what I mean, "The next Sidney Poitier," you know, that kind of thing.  And I remember I wanted to go out for whatever the lead role was in that.  And somehow or another it never quite happened.  The audition went well.  They were excited, but they wanted me to play something much, much smaller, a little chorus kind of thing.  And I said, "Why can't I be the lead?"  Unh-uh, well, the lead in the--there's a white woman here and--I, I got a lesson there.  Now you still--you--you're a black guy up here.  "We--we're not having that." That was my first time dealing with that, that R word, racism.  "You're not gonna star in this classic thing.  Oh, no you're not.  We like you, but we like you--we like you doing--," I used to imitate Flip Wilson.  I mean--you know--you know, "We like you like that.  Well, you'll--we'll take that, but we're not taking this," and that really, really, really got me.  I said, "Oh, my god," you know.  And I remember--I remember the guy's name.  I remember the white boy who got the role, and he was not as good as me.  I knew that, and we all knew it.  But, hey, this is a wel- welcome, welcome to America in 1974 I guess it had to be, yeah.  So I learned something there, yeah, learned something there.
Story_ID: 663753
Speaker 1: Now you interviewed--your interview of [HistoryMaker] Dionne Warwick took place in--was, was it in college or--
Speaker 2: College.
Speaker 1: In college, okay, all right, all right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Senior year, 1978, yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, so we're not there--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we're not there yet, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, so, well, yeah, so you kind of got in the groove, though, when you--at Darrow [Darrow School, New Lebanon, New York].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you weren't trying to come back home or anything after the--after you were there?
Speaker 2: Af- after, after Thanksgiving (laughter)?  I was--I'm here.  I loved it--loved it, could not wait to get back to campus.  'Cause, again, I really developed strong friendships because all we had wa- was ea- was each other.  So I understood the power--I learned the power of friendship and sharing that I--while I had friends back home and that they gone see this and they gone misunderstand, it was a little bit different 'cause I was so far away from home that I really needed to call up on friends more--make them and call upon them more there.
Speaker 1: Do you still keep in touch with Darrow friends?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, Anita [Anita Jenkins] will be here today, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we're--yeah, I've good friendship--good, good friends there, as well as my friends from East Orange [New Jersey].  You know, there--there's a certain group of us.  We're on Facebook all the time, and, and they know about this.  So, yeah--no, no, no, I, I got a good, good base still.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now when you graduated was--is there any, any stories about graduation or did you get any particular honors or?
Speaker 2: Nothing special, I just graduated, you know, one of maybe five black students that year who graduated.
Speaker 1: Out of how many students?
Speaker 2: I think we had thirty in the class--thirty in the graduating class.  It was a very small school.  No more than a hundred and fifty students were there period.  But I will tell you this, I was the only one to get into an Ivy League school in my class.  I will tell you that--black or white.  I will tell you that.  So I went to Columbia University [New York, New York] and so that's my--that--that's--that was my distinction.
Speaker 1: Now how did you end up choosing Columbia?
Speaker 2: Primarily that the--we call the minority student advisors [Carole Johnson and Paul Johnson], they, they encouraged it because there's another brother before me who went--who was there a year before me, and they really felt that, you know, you need to consider that.  I applied to other schools that weren't as well known as Columbia.  And, of course, my mother [Waldron's foster mother, Bertha Hill Culver], because she would work in the suburbs of Jersey [New Jersey], she knew of Columbia University.  She knew of Princeton University [Princeton, New Jersey], and she felt that, "That's where you should go."  This is my foster mother's voice.  So that's where you should go.  So she understood Ivy League.  You know, she, she said, "No, that's where you gonna go."  And she really liked Princeton a lot, you know, but I didn't apply to Princeton.  I applied to Columbia.  She said, "That's okay.  It's the same league, same ballpark, and you're fine.  Go, go right ahead." And I got in--I got in, so I was happy about that.

Speaker 1: What did you do--declare as a--as a major?
Speaker 2: English literature, English literature.  And I declared it just at the last minute, because I didn't really know what I wanted to do until I got involved with summer internships.  Summer internships changed things-- changed things for me, sort of gave me a career direction.  'Cause I just sort of fell into journalism.  I did not go there thi- you know, thinking that was--that's what I was gonna do, but my freshman year I got my first internship--first job outside of what I did in East Orange [New Jersey] working for Columbia Records in their summer internship program.  And I know my--Darrow School [New Lebanon, New York] friend, Anita, and I both got the Columbia Records internship.
Speaker 1: So this is Anita--
Speaker 2: Her last name is Jenkins [Anita Jenkins].
Speaker 1: Jenkins, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, she--so she--we, we both did that.  And then the second year, my sophomore year--and actually, let's backtrack.  I heard about the Columbia Records internship from this magazine called Black Collegian [The Black Collegian] that I would later write for.  I don't know where--I was at the library flipping through it 'cause I'm always reading magazines and newspapers, and I flipped and I said, internships for minority students?  Columbia?  I love music.  Columbia Records had Lou Rawls, and Natalie Cole, and Earth, Wind and Fire, what--and Johnny Mathis--what?  So I said, "We need to apply to this," and we, we did.  I'll never forget the day that it happened.  Again, living angels making a difference.  We're sitting there in the lobby of Columbia Records in New York City [New York, New York].  And a woman named Irene Gandy, who is a big time publicist--music, and now she's a Broadway publicist.  She walked in, saw these two little black kids sitting there, and said, "What you--what are you here for?"  I said, "We're here to meet Frank Calamede [ph.]," or whatever his name is, "about the summer internship."  "Oh, okay, and what schools, you know, do you go to?"  I said, "I'm Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York]," and she was at Tufts University [Medford, Massachusetts]. "Okay, okay.  Kibby [ph.], take--where's your application?"  And we gave it to her.  "I'm gonna write my name on here, Irene Gandy, and you take this to Frank and tell him that I, I want you guys to come up on here.  Yeah, I just like how you carry yourself.  I like how, how you spoke to me."  Huh?  We got the--we got--we got internships.  And to this day, she does not remember that at all.  And then I've grew to write about all her clients, and I said, "Remember you gave me my first in- ?" She does not remember that.  Again, that's how gracious she was.  But my point is it started with the Columbia Records internship, end of my freshman year of college.
Story_ID: 663755
Speaker 1: The next year I worked for public television.  This is where the journalism is starting to really fold down--unfold.  I worked for a TV show called 'The MacNeil/Lehrer Report' and that's Robert MacNeil and Jim Lehrer, and they're still around today.  MacNeil, M-A-C capital N-E-I-L, Jim Lehrer, L-E-H-R-E-R.  'The MacNeil/Lehrer Report.'  Now it's called 'The Lehrer Report' [sic. 'PBS NewsHour'] I believe now--public television.  Long story short, I get there.
Speaker 2: Is this, this in D.C. [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 1: New York City [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: In New York.
Speaker 1: New York City.
Speaker 2: New York City.
Speaker 1: And there were two people there who took me under their wings.  One was [HistoryMaker] Charlayne Hunter-Gault, the big time journalist.  She was there at that time.  She just started when I was there.  And then there was a reporter named Crispin Campbell.  And Crispin, she said, "Clarence [HistoryMaker Clarence Waldron], you're not gonna spend your summer getting coffee for all of us.  You're going to go to work." I said, "Huh?"  So what she did, she said, "We have this big old report on the Civil Rights Movement, Amiri Baraka, [HistoryMaker] Ossie Davis; all those folks who did so much.  We want you to update this big old--this big--this big report and give it back to us."  "Huh?"  "So what you have to do, you have to call some of these people, and ask them what they're doing now and how do they feel the nation has changed since the '60s [1960s]," 'cause remember, we're in the '70s [1970s] now, "So that's your job."  And that was my job.  It turned out that they liked it so much, they asked me to come back during the school year.  So therefore I'm there I guess during the--my junior year--work study.  We made it work study at that point.  And that was an amazing point.  That's, that's when I had to major in English literature, because I knew I liked to write then.  I knew I liked, you know, digging up information, reporting.  I knew I was nosy, so to speak, and curious, and that's when I majored in English literature.  I wanted to major in journalism, but Columbia University [New York, New York] undergrad did not and does not have a journalism undergraduate program.  So I wanted to write, English literature.  I figure reading the great writers, I would get style and substance and, you know--you know, flare, and also I'll be just writing and, and learning.
Story_ID: 663756
Speaker 1: Were you influenced by the great English writers--I mean, did, did, are any of them with your work today I mean?
Speaker 2: I'll never for- yep, James Baldwin, James Baldwin.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Of the great English writers (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) James Baldwin. It wasn't just English, but--no, James Baldwin.  I'm, I'm--I go back to African American--James Baldwin was my favorite.  And I'll never forget that I--when I was in graduate school [Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, New York, New York], I wrote something about a church scene.  And my professor, Phyl Garland [Phyllis Garland], she said, "Oh, this has a color, the immediacy of James Baldwin."  So I liked that, so I, I--that really set out in my mind that I had--if you're doing something with--that look like James Baldwin, so you're doing something pretty good.  So I was real proud of, of that, that comment that she made on one of my--one of my works.  But no, so no, just, just--the--that, that--that's who stands out the most in terms of my writing style.  But, of course, you know, all the other guys I'm sure there's some influence there, but nothing that stood out.  I, I wanna say knowing that blue can symbolize hope came from one of those classic novels that I had to read, maybe Joyce [James Joyce] said that or Hemingway [Ernest Hemingway].  There's some little thing with the color blue that I remember from one of those classic readings one year.  But, no, James Baldwin, was, was the guy.  Of course, [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou too, of course--those two--Maya Angelou too, but James, James.  'Cause Maya was just getting started, but James was the one, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did, did, did, did, did you ever have an opportunity to meet James Baldwin in those days?
Speaker 2: Yep, met him once at the public television show ['The MacNeil/Lehrer Report'; 'PBS NewsHour'], the news show.  I met him one time.  He came to be interviewed at my job.  Again, I was just an intern.  My job was to run across to so and so store and bring a shirt.  Bring--buy a shirt for James Baldwin to wear during the taping.  So that was my--that was my contribution.  And I just met, you know, hello, kind of thing, and the he came in to do--to do--to do the interview, you know.  Why we--why--I don't know was that customary to, to supply wardrobe.  But either way, he wanted a, a, a new--he needed a new blue shirt, and my job was to go and find it.  So they gave me his size and I went to do it so--intern (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right, this is--what it's like da- WNET [WNET-TV], right?
Speaker 2: WNET, WNET, Channel 13 in New York City [New York, New York] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay. All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So this is--all right, so now we're, we're what, around 1977 now or something or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, '77 [1977] now.
Story_ID: 663757
Speaker 1: And then the next summer, junior year [at Columbia University, New York, New York] I worked for Money magazine as a intern.  That's part of Time magazine [Time Inc.].  I went to Money magazine end of junior year.  That was a, a good experience too.  That's where I learned about fact checking, how everything matters I journalism.  I would have to--I would have to check everyone's name, age, what city the reporter said they lived in.  I have to call them to confirm that you lived in, you know, Washington, D.C., and not Seattle, Washington--whatever.  It taught me about accuracy being the name of the game in journalism.  That came from my internship there, yeah.
Speaker 2: Now did you have any experiences with the National Association of Black Journalists [NABJ] at this point?
Speaker 1: Not at this point, no.  I, I, I embraced them when I was here in Chicago [Illinois] with Jet magazine.  I came onto them not as a student, but as a professional.  That's when I came on (unclear), yeah.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I know, like, sometimes they--the students get a chance to go to the convention.
Speaker 1: The campus.  I don't know how big that was back then.  You know what I mean?  I don't know how big it was thirty, you know, years ago about that--I don't know.  Either way, I wasn't a student.
Speaker 2: I think they started up in '73 [1973].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Because they were really new.
Speaker 1: So sort of new then, yeah, yeah, yep.  So, so that's internships.  So therefore I, I found my career through an internship.  So I even tell people today, students that I teach at Northwestern [Medill School of Journalism; Medill School of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communications, Evanston, Illinois] and Columbia College Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], that internship is the way to get the experience and get your foot in the door.  It was true thirty some odd years ago and it's--hey--it's still true today.  You want some good internships.  Mine were paid back in the day 'cause they paid.  They don't pay now, but you'll get your money later on is what I tell people.
Story_ID: 663758
Speaker 1: Your senior year is the year that you interviewed [HistoryMaker] Dionne Warwick?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How did that come about?
Speaker 2: Without knowing it I, I understood the importance of a news hook.  There has to be a reason why you are writing a story and why people would care.  So obviously, Dionne was a big name at that point.  She had just came off the road with [HistoryMaker] Isaac Hayes in '77 [1977].  She had recorded 'Then Came You' with The Spinners in '75-ish [1975].  So, you know, she was still--she's a name--got that.  But I also knew that Dionne was earning her master's in music at that time.  'Cause when she started recording she left school [The Hartt School, University of Hartford, West Hartford, Connecticut].  She left college in her junior year to go work with Burt Bacharach and Hal David doing demonstration records.  And so she went back in the '70s [1970s], and she actually had the professor on the road with her.  So I said, hm, Dionne Warwick's getting her master's in education, yet she'll never need a mas- master's I music--master's in music.  She doesn't really need that, but there's a message for black kids--black college kids.  So why don't--why don't we have Dionne do an interview for The Black Collegian to speak to the importance of education for our people.  And so I sent a letter to her manager, and they all agreed yes, yes, yes.  And I was--and I remember the day very well.  It was November of '78 [1978], November--early--the first week of November.  I caught a cab down to the Regency Hotel [Loews Regency New York, New York, New York] where she was staying--Park Avenue.  And there, there it was, so it went very, very well.  But I knew--I knew what a news hook was.  I knew how to make it work.  I knew how to make it work.  Even at that age I, I understood, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Black Collegian out of New Orleans [Louisiana], right?
Speaker 2: Yep, yep, right.
Speaker 1: Distributed all over the country.
Speaker 2: Oh, yep, so that made me--I was a campus correspondent [at Columbia University, New York, New York], so I would write about things in New York [New York].  So--but also I did during that same year, I went--I covered--I did my first review of, of--first Broadway review.  It was [HistoryMaker] Eartha Kitt in 'Timbuktu!' [Luther Davis].  This was Eartha Kitt's big comeback to America.  I know she won a Tony [Antoinette Perry Award for Excellence in Theatre] nomination for that performance.  And [HistoryMaker] Melba Moore was in that same production.  I remember that.  And then [HistoryMaker] Geoffrey Holder directed it.  But either way, my--I wrote that for The Black Collegian as well.  I would love to see that story.  I can't find that one.  I knew how to call to get a picture of her on stage and all that kind of stuff so, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: I remember that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'Timbuktu!'  And her first line was, "I am here," in that little cat growl.  "I'm here," and that's where it's at.  I'm back, that you could--you could not hold me down.  You know, you thought that you had me ten years ago, after I turned that White House luncheon out, but guess what?  Eartha Kitt is doing well, and she was.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right, that's a famous story, the White House luncheon--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) with Eartha Kitt.
Story_ID: 663759
Speaker 1: You talked about extending the interview with [HistoryMaker] Dionne Warwick from a half hour initially to an hour and a half.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did it just happen because the conversation just got good or?
Speaker 2: Because it was that, it was that good.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean, she was impressed that this young kid knew so much about her.  So--and I--and I researched her.  I mean, I knew the name of her professor who was on the road with her.  I knew when she left the school [The Hartt School, University of Hartford, West Hartford, Connecticut].  I knew all her friends' music, you know, [HistoryMaker] Nancy Wilson--I mean, I knew of them--I knew of her friendship.  You know, playing--was the Pinochle--backsies--backstage at the Apollo Theater [New York, New York].  So when I--whenever Nancy would be on stage, Leslie Uggams and Dionne would be in the back--you know, back--in the--back in the dressing room playing Pi- Pinochle and stuff like that.  She was like, "Wow, you knew that?"  And then I'm from her hometown [East Orange, New Jersey].  Oh, we had a--we had a--it was a love fest.  It was great.  It was my first time seeing--having room service.  'Cause in and I told her, I said, "I am absolutely scared to death."  I was ten minutes late for the interview 'cause (unclear)--got a cab, uptown New York [New York], and I was just afraid.  What if she's not what I think?  I'm a--I'm a young kid at this point--oh, my god.  And so I was--I'm scared.  So I got there and I apol- , "I'm so sorry that I'm running a few minutes late, Ms. Warwick."  "Call me Dionne." "Ms. Warwick," you know.  And then she said, "Do you want some coffee?"  I said, "Yes, please."  So then she ordered the coffee and all that stuff, and I saw how they bring it in and she signed her name.  So I never saw that before.  See, my world was not that big.  I said, "Oh, I like that."  So the minute I get to the hotel--you know, years later at my Johnson days [Johnson Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois], "Room service, please," (laughter).  "I want my breakfast served in my room please, yeah, and charge it--charge it to my--to my room, thank you."  I learned that--learned that from her.
Story_ID: 663760
Speaker 1: Now you said that with this interview with [HistoryMaker] Dionne Warwick [for The Black Collegian] really had set the tone for what you would do in future interviews.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Good.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was so thrilled that it wasn't a horrible experience.  I was so thrilled that she treated me as if I was a Jet magazine editor or New York Times [The New York Times] editor.  She didn't make me feel like I was a little kid.  And I said, "You know what I'm gonna do?"  I said, "From this moment on I'm gonna treat everyone the way that I'm being treated today, with the respect, care--," you know, that type of thing.  And whoever I talk to I'm gonna act as if they're Dionne Warwick--I really care about them.  And of course I do, but I'm saying it set a tone of just being courteous, being respectful, learning how to make eye contact as a journalist, because the truth is always in the eyes.  I tell my students that.  The truth--you can tell when someone's gonna be with you or they're leaving you.  So all that came from that first interview.  And my first time doing it, and it just let me know that there's so much more that I was gonna be able to do, you know, and then life comes full circle and for us to have our friendship that we have, you know, for the last thirty years is pretty nice.  So, yeah, definitely--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --definitely.
Story_ID: 663761
Speaker 1: Is there anything more about your undergraduate days at Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York], 'cause you went on to get your graduate degree in journalism, then right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, so was there any special honors in graduating or any--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I got a, a fellowship to, to attend Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism [New York, New York] where I got my master's [degree].  I got a fellowship from RCA--RCA-NBC Fellowship.  It was a full scholarship, tuition and fees.  And I remember when I was interviewed at the grad school, the woman, who turned out to be one of my professors later on, she asked me, "What is it about you that makes you stand out this year?  Of all the applicants, what is it about [HistoryMaker] Clarence Waldron we should--that we should know or that we should--we should look into?"  And we know--we know, know the answer.  "I'm sure there's no other applicant who has interviewed someone as big as [HistoryMaker] Dionne Warwick at age twenty.  They've--no one else who's applying has gotten to a Barbra Streisand, unh-uh, or Frank Sinatra, no.  I'm the only one who can say that."  And she said, "Wow, really?"  And then I told her all about it and you know and whatever and whatever, whatever, whatever.  So, yeah, that--and that was good.  So bottom line, I got into the school; I also got a full scholarship to attend the school, and that was another big, big moment for me.
Speaker 1: Well, you didn't tell us about Barbra Streisand or Frank Sinatra.
Speaker 2: No, no, no, I just--no, no--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I said--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --or anyone else would have--did they interview someone like a Barbra Streisand.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: That's what I mean, or a Frank Sinatra.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay--
Speaker 2: You know, I'm telling you that I'm bringing you a big name celebrity right now at an age--at a young age.  And I don't know anyone else is do- doing that right now, this year applying to your school, yeah. (Laughter) And she said, "Yeah, you're right about that."  So, so, so, so thank you Dionne.
Story_ID: 663762
Speaker 1: So the die cast, in terms of what you wanted to do with your career as a journalist?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: In ter- was the die cast at that point?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think so.  I mean, remember I grew up loving music, loving, loving pop culture.  My aunt Catherine [Catherine Culver] sent me to my very first Dionne [HistoryMaker Dionne Warwick] concert.  I took that love for her to be able to write about her and other people years later.  Yeah, it definitely--I knew that pop culture was, was what--was what I was gonna do, you know.  I could do other things, and I did every--other, other things too.  My passion, follow it.  That's the key--I think the key to success is finding something that you like to do that you don't call work.  And I--years and go--would go by.  And one time sitting with [HistoryMaker] Ramsey Lewis and I just said to him in the--in the interview, "I cannot believe that I'm being paid to talk to you.  There's nothing else that I wanna do right now."  So that's the key in life is finding what you like to do and what you do well.  They should be the same thing.  And then, then you--then you're set where you're not working, so.  My passion is real clear, you know, real clear.  And also they, I think the, you know, the power of a journalist always has im- impressed me, meaning that we are--I am a storyteller, and I am here to tell you a story.  And I am here to win your trust in the telling of that story.  And I can trust you that if you trust me, it'll work out just fine.  And that's how it's been, you know, for all these years.
Speaker 1: How does that work when there's really something bad about somebody to tell--to tell (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Again, everybody has a story.  I'm here to give your side of the story.  I may not believe what you're saying.  I may not believe in you at all, but my job is to get your side--your, your point of view.  I can do that and not like you at all.  And, and there's, there's not a--there's not a like situation; it's a business situation, and I got that early on, but I can talk to anybody.
Speaker 1: So in terms of an interview, and, and--well, I hear what you're saying.  You're there to let the person tell their story through, through your, your interactions with, with them.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, I'm giving 'em a platform.
Speaker 1: You're not--you're not doing an investigative expose on all truth--
Speaker 2: Right, no, no, no.
Speaker 1: You're, you're letting them tell what they--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --wanna tell, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I, I haven't done any--you know, the, the, the Jet days were not about investigative reporting for the most part.  So that's, that's not my--that's not my area.
Speaker 1: Okay, (unclear), you know, what's gonna give them a voice.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you give, give them a voice and, and just be fair whether you believe in what they're saying or not.  That's not--that's not--that's not my call.  If I wanna--if I wanna get you then I do a bit on you, if I wanna--if I wanna tell you--say, I really don't believe what you're saying or what you said or what you're doing.   That's a different--that's something different.  That's over there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I like--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 663763
Speaker 1: Well, who were your teachers at, at Columbia [Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, New York, New York].  I mean that--I mean, are any of them memorable in terms of--
Speaker 2: Now, you're talking about undergraduate or graduate (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, both actually but, but undergraduate es- I mean, gra- graduate especially because--since you're a journalist.
Speaker 2: Yeah, let--let's, let's deal with that first.  Phyllis Garland, who was an Ebony editor before she became a professor at Columbia University [New York, New York].  It was Phyllis Garland who got a call from Jet magazine saying, "We need somebody.  How about some of your former students?"  At that point, my very first job out of graduate school was for a daily newspaper in Atlantic City, New Jersey, called The Press or the Atlantic City Press [The Press of Atlantic City], and I was a general assignment reporter.  And I got a call saying--you know, "Phyl Garland recommended you.  You know, can you come out to Chicago [Illinois] for an interview?"  And they flew me out, and I joined the company [Johnson Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois] in, in October, 1982, and I was there for twenty-nine years.  Phyl Garland stood out also because I wanted to do what she did, and I took her cultural affairs reporting class.  And she talked to me about interviewing Joseph--Josephine Baker, La Baker they called her, Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Miles Davis.  And I heard those names and I said, "That's what I wanna do."  And she did all that through her days at Ebony obviously.  And the also, I said you know, I could see myself teaching one day too, which is what I'm doing.  But, yeah, that's when I said cultural affairs for sure.  I had the Dionne [HistoryMaker Dionne Warwick] experience and I wanted more.  Dionne said you should do more.  You gone do more 'cause it's not all about me.  And so there's my next--my next living angel was Phyllis Garland, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, so your Columbia experience, in terms of undergrad school--I mean graduate school, really prepared you for your career as a journalist.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, yeah, that's when it all came together.  The internships as an undergraduate gave me good insight into what I was getting myself into, with that--with the--whether I was gonna like this thing or not called journalism.  I got that from all those internships in Columbia, Channel 13 [WNET-TV, New York, New York], and Money magazine.  I got a good idea of what this thing is all about, yeah.
Story_ID: 663764
Speaker 1: We ran over The Press really fast, but that--you were there for one year?
Speaker 2: Two years.
Speaker 1: Two years?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Two years, two years.  The story there is that my mother [Waldron's foster mother, Bertha Hill Culver]--when I got out of graduate school [Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, New York, New York], couldn't find a job, and I was offered a job.  My very first offer was for a paper in Abilene, Texas, where they did the--I believe the, the Western films where a lot of them were, were taped at--maybe John Wayne.  I don't--I don't remember the details, but I remember Western films.  My mother told me she didn't care what was filmed down there, that I was not gonna go down to Abilene, Texas, 'cause that's too far away from New Jersey and that's it.  So I said so--I said, "Mommy, what am I gonna do?"  She said, "Well, you can go back upstairs to your typewriter and you gonna send out some more resumes and find a place a little closer to New Jersey," (laughter), and a few months later I found a job in a--in Atlantic City [New Jersey].  But, again, she was clear.  We were homebodies, and even this day, prefer to be home in, in Chicago [Illinois], my home.  I'm not--I'm not running around.  I'm, I'm just conditioned to be home.  That's, that's who I am.  Yeah, yeah, so that's how I wound up at, at Atlantic City Press [The Press of Atlantic City].
Speaker 1: So what was the nature of The Press?  I mean--
Speaker 2: It, it was a--it was a--it was the paper in town.  So I covered obituaries.  I covered the city council meeting.  I covered NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] meetings.  I covered, you know, a little bit of everything--some, some cultural affairs reporting.  And then I asked could I branch out and go to New York [New York] to do a review of Lena Horne's play that was big.  It's 1980, 1981.  She was doing a Broadway play called 'The Lady and Her Music' ['Lena Horne: The Lady and Her Music'].  And I said, "Well, I'm, I'm always in--up in, you know, north Jersey," you know, two hours from Atlantic City, every weekend anyway, 'cause I did not stay in Atlantic City.  I did not like Atlantic City like that.  I've always went home.  "So I'll be in New York.  I'll be able to get tickets to the show.  How about we do something for the Sunday paper on Lena Horne's singing?  It's, it's, it's the talk of Broadway."  And they went for it, and then I started getting a chance to do a few more, not much, but a few more, you know, music, cultural pieces.  And they were pretty much based in New York, because there was always a arts critic right there in Atlantic City on, on staff, so I couldn't get in his way.  So I had to sort of find--create--again, creating opportunity.  Then I go up to New York and do some of that stuff in New York, which still is relevant to people down there in Atlantic City, yeah.

Speaker 1: Okay, so it was in, what, 1980 that your--
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: --professor recommended you to Jet? Or--
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty-two [1982].
Speaker 1: Eighty-two [1982], okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I came to Jet in October of 1982, yeah.
Speaker 1: Just let me backtrack a minute.  Now, now you came out of Columbia graduate school [Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, New York, New York] then in, what?  Eighty [1980]--
Speaker 2: Eighty [1980].
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty [1980].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I did undergraduate [Columbia University, New York, New York] and came out in 1979, and then I spent almost I guess two years in a--in Atlantic City [The Press of Atlantic City], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so, so this is--you had to be really excited about, you know, going to--coming to Chicago [Illinois], right, to work for Johnson [Johnson Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I wa- I was--I was--I was thrilled.  I was thrilled.  First time that far away from home [East Orange, New Jersey]--this far away from home, but you see I stayed (laughter).  I grew up and I stayed.  It was--I was--
Speaker 1: Did--
Speaker 2: I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: No, did you know anybody here in Chicago?
Speaker 2: I knew one friend from my Columbia days.  As a matter of fact, when I came to, to town for the interview I stayed with his family on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois], yeah.  Because the (unclear) Johnsons flew me in, they'll fly me right back the same day.  And I said, "Well, I at least wanna spend the night here just to see what I'm getting myself into."  So I stayed with a, a friend in town just so I could go around and see what's, what's, what and see different things, see what this--Chicago's gonna be, you know, all about.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I remember what--I remember one thing too is, is, is exciting I guess and it's sort of symbolic.  But I remember the song that was number one in the country when I came out here, Evelyn "Champagne" King, 'Love Come Down' (laughter), "Love come down, all the way down."  And I said it was okay, Chicago, Chicago makes my love come down.  This is gonna work out just fine (laughter).  This is gonna work out just fine, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Were we--were you interviewed by Mr. Johnson there?
Speaker 2: I met him.  Yep, and I was interviewed by--who was I interviewed by?  Herbert Nipson, who was Ebony.  Bob Johnson [Robert E. Johnson], who was Jet, and Mr. Johnson.  And I remember a Mr. Johnson moment and Bob Johnson the most.  Mr. Johnson had me on the tenth floor, and we're standing, looking down over the lobby--no, the balcony, looking down on Michigan Avenue, and then he was saying like, "This is--this--this is the--this is the house that I built.  You know, this is--this is--this is what I built," and how this was the only black owned building on any major downtown boulevard or avenue was a Johnson building.  And he was just so proud of that.  And I said to myself, wow, a black man owns this; this is just amazing.  But also what I liked about him was he was just so earthy, that it wasn't a stuffiness.  It wasn't an arrogance, just a real simple man next door who has a whole lot of money, who is very proud of himself, as you should be.  I remember--I remember that.  And it, it, it, it was real short interview.  It was basically just walking on the tenth floor of his building.  It wasn't no twenty-five minute grill, you know.  And he, he--I could--I could tell when I met him that the job was mine.  I could--I could feel it--very, very comfortable.  I had the right credentials; I was recommended highly; and I knew my writing was, was, was where it should be, so I remember that.  Then I went downstairs and met Bob Johnson, who was the executive editor for Jet, who later become my boss.  And no, I, I don't remember the conversation, but what I remember is standing there at the door, and he was talking about civil rights; he was talking about Malcolm X; he was just talking about Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] 'cause they went to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] together.  And I was like, wow, that's who I wanna work for.  That's who I wanna work for.  I'd never seen a black man that strong, powerful, intelligent.  Whatever it was, he had always earth--always down to earth.  You know, the Bob--Bob I think is from Alabama, so he had a little southern thing there but a real coolness that I admired.  I just--I admired that.  And remember now I hadn't--I didn't do the historically black college [HBCU] thing, so outside of Phyl Garland [Phyllis Garland] and graduate school, and my African American literature professor and undergraduate school, I didn't see that many brothers running stuff, doing stuff, so I was impressed by that.  I was--I said Bob Joh- I mean, between John Johnson [HistoryMaker John H. Johnson], of course, but Bob Johnson--yeah, I said I can learn from him.  I can learn from him and, and I did, yeah.
Story_ID: 663766
Speaker 1: What was your initial title you were hired at?
Speaker 2: When I started I think--I think the title was assistant editor, yeah.  'Cause then--'cause back then everything, everything under Johnson's [HistoryMaker John H. Johnson] days were editors, so assistant editor, associate editor; then I was features editor; then I was senior editor, and then senior writer, and then senior editor-ish again.  But it was--you know, during his days, it was always the word editor.  He didn't--he didn't have that as part of his structure, yeah.
Speaker 1: Who did you report to initially?
Speaker 2: Bob Johnson [Robert E. Johnson].
Speaker 1: Okay, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --go ahead.
Speaker 2: So my first little story that I wrote or interviewed somebody there was Dr. Arthur Thomas who was at that point president of Central State University [Wilberforce, Ohio].
Speaker 1: So you did a story about Dr. Thomas (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I did something on my first week there.  And I didn't know the friendship with he and Bob, but I knew, "Clarence [HistoryMaker Clarence Waldron], get your recorder.  I want you to meet Dr. Arthur E. Thomas."  Always have the E in that name, Dr. Arthur E. Thomas.  "Uh-huh, and you gonna sit here, and you gonna--," and I--whatever it was I did, and, and everybody was pleased with the result.  That was my--and I felt that I was being tested as well.  I felt that this is part of my early training, my probation, to see whether this, this kid can figure out what to do with a Central State University president and how you gone turn this around and do it quickly.  And, and, and I--and I did, yeah, yeah--Dr. Arthur E. Thomas, yep.
Speaker 1: Okay, what, what was going on there at that time?
Speaker 2: He had a curriculum, something that he wanted the freshmen at Central State University to use that he had devised--some kind of curriculum for freshmen at Central State as well as other schools, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right, so, so this, this article appeared in Jet, right?
Speaker 2: Yep, in Jet.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yep.
Story_ID: 663767
Speaker 1: What's the daily routine like at--at Johnson [Johnson Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: We would have meetings every day with Bob Johnson [Robert E. Johnson] and Mr. Johnson [HistoryMaker John H. Johnson].  He was very, very hands on, so every day we would meet and we would discuss what was in the news, what was in all the papers.  We get papers from across the country, and we would sit with him to, to determine what we would--we would put in the magazine each week.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so you would glean--'cause Jet actually presents news from other news sources (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Back in those days, yes, yes--yeah, yeah.  Associated Press would have something.  If they had a black angle or had, had an interest to black America, we might use it, sure.
Speaker 1: Okay, and--so, so I'm, I'm--I mean, for in--for instance, you'd get to work at what time and what time--what, what was your, your daily--
Speaker 2: Oh, nine o'clock, and most days to seven or eight on deadline days until we got done, so that could be eleven o'clock at night.  But usually we're done by nine o'clock at the latest back in the day, yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, on a deadline day.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and that, that would be like Thursday and Friday.  One part is broke down one day; one part the next day, so.
Speaker 1: Oh, so you typically have nine, ten, ten hour days?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I would say that, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And--all, all right, so how big a staff did you have for Jet?
Speaker 2: Oh, we had--we had--we used a lot of freelancers--freelance photographers and some freelance writers.  So there may have been like maybe seven or eight of--eight editors, maybe, back, back in the beginning days, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, so would the day start off with a meeting with (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It would come late morning, around eleven o'clock, to give us time to review the news ourselves so we can bring ideas to the meeting and see what's out there.  And we all would read certain papers and all that kind of stuff, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay and now in the beginning, did you have assignments?  I mean, would you assign--or would you be assigned to go out and interview someone in--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --celebrities are in Chicago [Illinois] or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, Bob Johnson would do that.  And it was pretty much whoever was in town in those days, whatever celeb or politician, they would have to come by Jet magazine.  Otherwise, they just--they, they--you could not come to Chicago without doing that.  So that's where I would do a lot of my interviewing, right there in, in the--in the Jet building and, of course, I would travel out too, as the years went by.
Speaker 1: Okay, but a lot of them actually came (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A lot--everybody came by there, yeah.  And, this, this is--this is before the, 'The Oprah Winfrey Show,' so everybody would come by Johnson, you know.  And wherever you going, you going.  You going over there to the top of the charts, or you're on your way down to the bottom of the charts, you gonna come by Jet magazine at some point for some support (laughter).
Story_ID: 663768
Speaker 1: Now what was your first big stor- big story I guess that you would consider like--
Speaker 2: Oh, that--that's a tough one 'cause that I can't remember.  I know that I, I did the first cover story for Whitney Houston, 1985; I know that I did the first cover story for Anita Baker, 1986; and I know I did the very first cover story for Luther Vandross, and that's again in the '80s [1980s].  And I think we, we have--we have 'em here somewhere.  We can look at the date, yeah.  And that, that, that felt good to be a part of the early days of careers and learning some important things.  Going back to the early days with Dionne [HistoryMaker Dionne Warwick], treat everybody with respect because you never know who's going to become the next what.  So, Anita Baker, brand new person.  You don't know a month after we did our little short interview she blew up; time for a cover; she remembered Clarence [HistoryMaker Clarence Waldron], "Let's do it."  Whitney Houston, the same--the same--the same way, you know.  So--and Luther as well.  He came by for a luncheon, and then during the luncheon I did the interview.  And then I followed up with him up in New York City [New York, New York], and that was his first cover story.  So, sort of felt, felt--always felt good about identifying who was gonna be the next big thing and playing a role in getting that message [Jet] out--pretty, pretty happy, pretty proud about that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so did--how long did it take for the, the--I guess the magazine to trust you to identify that kid of talent (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, well, if I came at the end of 1982--Whitney I think was '85 [1985].  So I'd say with--within three years I was doing the, the, the, the biggies within three years, if not before.  But those are the ones that I personally liked.  Them--I'm sure there were some cover stories before '85 [1985], but those are the ones that stood out for me that I will--that I--that I feel good about, that I--that I'll hold onto (unclear) I remember, so.  But those are the ones that I said okay, got this.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) '84 [1984], '85 [1985], (unclear) was,  "Run Jesse [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson], run!"  He was running for president.
Speaker 2: Yep, yep, yep.
Speaker 1: The story about Vanessa Williams came out, the scandal story.
Speaker 2: Yep, yep, I remember that.  I remember that.  And I was--it's funny, after that happened, I was asked to be a judge for Miss America a few years after that whole scandal, yeah.  Yeah, I remember that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Harold Washington--
Speaker 2: And she came by the building [Johnson Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois].  She came by the bu- and Harold Washington, yeah.
Speaker 1: It was a big thing in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, now Bob Johnson [Robert E. Johnson] had the Harold Washington stories on lockdown.  He did--he did most of those.  He did most of those.  That one--that one got away, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, but--you know, it was a big thing in Chicago in those days, you know, Harold Washington.  The--so, so--let's see--these are the big Michael Jackson years too at least in the mid-'80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: And Michael pretty much belonged to, to Bob.  He did most of those.  He did most of those.  Yeah, 'cause Michael, Michael would come to the building when he was so young before he became Michael.  He was--he had developed a friendship with Mr. Johnson [HistoryMaker John H. Johnson] and Bob Johnson, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--but, but you caught onto Whitney Houston early--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Anita Ba- Baker, Luther Vandross, and--
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, and even Sade--Sade as well.  When she came--who is this little woman from London [England], a Nigerian father [Adebisi Adu] with his long ponytail.  You know, we didn't know who she was, but we knew that she was gonna--we knew it was gone be a hot time for her.  'Cause Whitney--as you remember, Whitney opened the door for female R and B singers.  Everyone wanted an--a Whitney Houston, so Anita Baker got signed, Miki Howard got signed, Sade got signed, Regina Belle got signed.  The female R and B singers who could just stand there and sing, no gimmicks, became the thing after Whitney Houston's success, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now this is also a time when the, the videos were getting big in the '80s [1980s], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, Michael Jackson sort of got that started.  He did get that started with MTV [Music Television; MTV], you know, with his--with his first things there, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, so how, how was I guess entertainment landscape, like, changing in the '80s [1980s] and you know, as, as you--as we, we go into the '90s [1990s]?
Speaker 2: Well, I think videos became bigger and bigger.  You know what I mean--you know, bigger and bigger.  Now, of course, things are totally different.  I mean, now is electronic.  Everything's on iTunes and--I mean, you can still, you know--you know, you can buy CDs [compact disc], but--what, you got Target [Target Corporation] or Walmart [Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.], but of the stores like Target, I know those kind of places are gone now.  So it's a different time to sell records now, a little bit different.
Story_ID: 663769
Speaker 1: Was there an interview [for Jet] in the '80s [1980s] that was the most memorable one do you think or?
Speaker 2: One of Anita Baker's were--was real good for me in the '80s [1980s].  And the thing about--'bout it of course, it was--I would say that the best stories that one can write is when they can walk home with something for themselves as writer to something else for me.  And what it was that we talked about her childhood and how she was raised by someone, a friend in church--like a grandmother figure in church raised her.  And we talked about that, and we also talked about--and no one--no one knew that by the point.  She, she never shared that, by the way.  But we also talked about--talked about the fact that at some point in our lives we have to say it's all about me, meaning, I cannot rely on anyone else for anything.  There's one point in your life you said there's no government, there's no, no, no help here, help there.  If I'm going to do this, it's up to me to do it.  So, and it's no more excuses.  You can't say well, because my mother didn't do this therefore I can't.  What are you gonna do?  What are you gonna do?  How are you gonna take care of yourself?  How are you gonna mem- move on.  So I got that from one of our interviews we did in the '80s [1980s].  You know, after--at some point you have to stop making excuses, and get up and learn how to take care of yourself.  Learn how to take care of yourself.  The buck stops with you, and I got that message out in one of her stories--earlier stories in the '80s [1980s], yeah.
Speaker 1: Did, did you kind of feel that way (laughter) here in Chicago [Illinois], so far away from everybody--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --that you grew up with?
Speaker 2: --I, I just understood--I just understood and, and with my life that, what did I--what did I want in my life.  Now, so either you're gonna--you know, you're gonna be angry at the world because you were not raised by your biological family.  So you're gonna deal with that or are you gonna try to fashion your life into something?  And we haven't got into legacies--lega- legacies and how I wanna be remembered, but certainly what I'm most proud of is that I, I made something happen for myself.  You know what I mean?  I recognized the good people around me, and I made something happen for myself.  And I just hope that other people do the same thing.  Life is too short.  You gotta get out there; fight for it.  The world is hard for everybody.  Every--we all got a story that's heavy.
Story_ID: 663770
Speaker 1: You said one of your first major interviews [for Jet magazine] was with, with Whitney Houston.  Now she's a--she's a niece of [HistoryMaker] Dionne Warwick.
Speaker 2: She's the--she was a cousin.
Speaker 1: Cousin, okay, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yep, yep, yeah, so I, I knew of her coming up.  I knew that there was gone be another great singer.  Dionne would tell me, "Another great singer in my family, Clarence [HistoryMaker Clarence Waldron].  If you think I'm whatever--if you think my sister [HistoryMaker] Dee Dee Warwick," who was considered to be the best singer in that family--and they all will say that, "wait until you hear this one.  She's gonna knock us--knock us out," and she did; she did (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 663771
Speaker 1: We were mentioning off camera the food and the atmosphere at, at JPC [Johnson Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois] in those days (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It, it, it was a family--it's a family place.  It was like you did not feel like you were going to work.  You were going to be with your family and you'll get work done.  But it was a real warm place, a lot of pride, black pride.  And I think that's why I wanted to be there, to, to, to be a part of this empire, you know.  And, and, and you also--you meet--you met la- lifelong friends there.  And no matter what, it's almost like Motown Records that no matter what you do there will be a connection to Johnson, and that's a good thing.  I mean, Diana Ross, Stevie [Stevie Wonder], Smokey [HistoryMaker Smokey Robinson] will always be Motown legends as well as whatever else they're doing.  So, I, I've embraced that.  I've, I've embraced that.  I'm sure that's why I'm here today.  I'm, I'm, I'm a Jet legend, so I'm fine with that; it's great, yeah, great.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the, the names of the photographers, and I'll always remember their names because of the centerfolds (laughter)--Moneta Sleet, Jr. [Moneta Sleet] and all the rest of rest of them.
Speaker 2: Well, who did the most though was Lamonte, [HistoryMaker] Lamonte McLemore of The 5th Dimension.  He did fifty years or more--fifty years of the, the Beauty of the Week, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Isaac Sutton--I mean--
Speaker 2: Isaac Sutton.
Speaker 1: --all those names.
Speaker 2: Isaac Sutton, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: But did--was there any par- particular photographer that you would work with at, at, at Johnson?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I worked for--to work with two: Vandell Cobb and James Mitchell.  Those were the two key people--occasionally freelance--but those were the two staff people that I did a lot of--lot of good stuff with.
Speaker 1: Okay and--oh, we were mentioning the cat--the food at Mo- Motown [sic.].  What is--tell us about that (unclear).  Everybody talks about that.
Speaker 2: Everybody talks about the, the, the food at Jet and Ebony.  Back in the day, I think it was a dollar, and you could have whatever.  I mean, we would have steak, potatoes, broccoli, peach cobbler, whatever you want.  And then the, the, the key is you could eat as much as you wanted.  So you go back.  If you wanted--you want two steaks, you can have two steaks (laughter).  Yeah, so the, the food was extraordinary for a dollar.  Yeah, that was--that was an amazing thing.  And then with luncheons, you know, with--you know, the celebrity luncheons with, you know, Luther Vandross and Lionel Richie and all that, we'd have the--you know, lobster, and steak, and you know, champagne.  It was, you know, it was a real nice--those were great, great, great moments.
Speaker 1: So, so this is--we were just saying this is--you're telling me something new in this, and I don't think I knew that, that, say Luther Vandross comes to J- Johnson Publishing, there would actually be special lunch for--
Speaker 2: Luncheons, yeah.  Yeah, we'd have a, a waiting--a waiting--a waiter staff--a waiting staff and would serve us on, you know, great--you know, good china and all that stuff.  It'd be Luther and his, his entourage.  Whitney [Whitney Houston] came to lunch with Dionne [HistoryMaker Dionne Warwick] and Cissy [HistoryMaker Cissy Houston], and that was--led to a cover story, the first time the three of them were together in the building.  Oh yeah, you know, Lionel, you know.  Everybody you could think of.  Sammy Davis [Sammy Davis, Jr.] was a favorite back in the early '80s [1980s] for lunch.  So it was great to meet these kind of people in that kind of, you know, social setting as well, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so I, I suppose--we've, we've interviewed [HistoryMaker] La Donna Tittle and I know she, she was at JPC back in the days--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --when the celebrities would come in and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --she had stories about, you know, them coming on the morning show.  And then--you know, then--so JPC was like a catchall for all the celeb- I mean, you come in and you can be on the radio, then you, you--you're interviewed, and then you know.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, I mean, you can be on the radio, 'cause we had the WJPC Radio [WNTD Radio, Chicago, Illinois]; you could be in Jet magazine; you could be in Ebony magazine; and then at one point, 'Ebony/Jet Showcase,' the TV.  So it was--you come down there, you get a whole lot done (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, we just had Darryl Dennard [HistoryMaker Darryl W. Dennard] in here a few--
Speaker 2: Oh, did you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) days ago.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah. Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, great, great, yeah.
Speaker 1: So this is--you're, you're right.  The whole gambit in those days.
Story_ID: 663772
Speaker 1: You worked for Johnson [Johnson Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois] in the days when Johnson was in its heyday.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I call those the glory days.  I mean, I'm--and I'm very proud to, to be a part of that and to sit with him every day.  So I had--I had a front row seat to how he did things, and I learned a lot.  I didn't know it at the time, but even as I sit here today, Mr. Johnson [HistoryMaker John H. Johnson] was a great teacher.  He taught me how to navigate in this world, how to deal with racism in this world, just how to put your foot down.  Like, like my mother, Bertha [Waldron's foster mother, Bertha Hill Culver], he knew how to say language that was understood universally.  "I'm not gonna take this from you, so you are going to do this.  Got it?"  He had that, that power, and I, I just, just watched that--just everything--how to multitask, how to do more than one thing.  So, although we're doing that now with--in the media, you have to do this or do that.  But back then you had to write, you know.  You had to maybe help set up the photo shoot if necessary.  You had to do more than.  You know, you had to invite guests to the building.  You need to, you know, go upstairs and find out what they need for their luncheon.  If you're gonna do a luncheon with Whitney [Whitney Houston], what does she like to eat?  You're the writer.  You tell me; find out, you know--coordinating the visit.  How long will they stay in the building--all that stuff.  Multitasking is something that I learned from him too, and which is helping me today 'cause I can do more than one thing.  That's the thing, you had to do more than one thing.  So Mr. Johnson--his birthday was just the other day, January 19th.  Just--and we always saying on (unclear)--just an extraordinary teacher.  And I'm just very privileged to have been able to sit with him every day to watch him do his thing, you know.  It's living--it lives--it lives in me--in all of us I think who worked there who saw him in action--an amazing man.
Story_ID: 663773
Speaker 1: You said most of the celebrities that you interviewed came to JPC [Johnson Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois]--I mean, to Johnson publications and--I mean, the--to the building, right?
Speaker 2: As the years went by, it's both, both ways.  I did a lot of traveling.  So Anita, Anita--Anita Baker came by one time for her first cover story.  For the second one, I went out to her home in Los Angeles [California].  So it depends, there's a lot--there's a lot of travel with the job, which is what I--what I appreciate too.  I was able to see the world, you know.  And not, not, any, any international travel, but I was able to see, see the country, you know, from working there, and how to stay in the best hotels and have my room service that Dionne [HistoryMaker Dionne Warwick] taught me how to do.  All that was just how it--how it was.  He [HistoryMaker John H. Johnson] wanted us be very comfortable when we're traveling, and that's what I--you know, what we all like now, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  In terms of the interviews, what--tell us about some of the highlights of your celebrity interviews.
Speaker 2: After twenty-nine years that--that's a hard one, but I will say that there's two people--three people--well, two, two I'll start off with who I'm--I've always--always enjoyed talking to them even to this day, Aretha Franklin and [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou.  Maya Angelou, there's no way in the world that you can be around her and not walk away stronger and wiser.  She, she empowers you.  I spent my Thanksgivings with her for the last four years.  And the beautiful thing about that is that she--when she invited me, she was very clear that she was inviting [HistoryMaker] Clarence Waldron.  "This is not to be a story.  I want you to come to my Thanksgiving gala for the weekend."  And I like that.  But she, she's one of my favorite people 'cause I, I, I learn something--you know, I learn something every, every time I, I ask her a question--she's a public intellectual, so you can't help but be lifted by her.  So Ma- anything that I've done with Maya I'm very proud of.  Wish I could do--wish I had did more, but I just love Maya Angelou.  You know, to this day she is playing a role in my new life, my post-Jet life.  You know, she's been helping me as I move into the book world--which I'm sure we'll get to that later on--so very, very encouraging, very encouraging.  Aretha is Aretha.  Again, I think that Aretha--I don't think, I know--is the most generous and thoughtful entertainer I've ever interviewed, you know, just very, very generous, very thoughtful--flowers coming--I mean, not flowers but, like, plants--I mean big, huge things.  She acknowledges people at her concerts.  She'll say--she'll have me stand up at a concert and say, "There's someone in the audience, Clarence Waldron, you know, a great writer from Jet magazine fame."  And she'll talk about what stories that I've done on her--I mean, just as recent as 2013.  She does this all the time--very thoughtful, just wanna make people know about you.  I wanna help you kind of, kind of person.  So Aretha's always fun, and I know I covered her, her fiftieth birthday party, although she was thirty-nine years old at the birthday party, understand that.  But I remember covering that in her home in Detroit [Michigan]--out in the suburbs of Detroit years ago.  So I've been following her for--I've known her for a good thirty, thirty some odd years, and she's just as loyal and helpful and faithful and great, yeah.  So those two people I like a lot.
Story_ID: 663774
Speaker 1: People always ask me what has been my most challenging interview--the most challenging--key word.  And the answer is [HistoryMaker] Minister Louis Farrakhan, Minister Louis Farrakhan.  He is just an amazing, complex man.  And I know that when I interviewed him for the very first time [for Jet]--when I felt the interview was getting, getting away from me, I had to politely bring it back.  Because as, as a reporter, and I teach my students at Northwestern University [Medill School of Journalism; Medill School of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communications, Evanston, Illinois] and Columbia College [Columbia College Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] this today, you can't lose control.  So you gotta bring things back.  And I just know that, you know, talking to him there was a few things that weren't quite clear.  I said, you know, "Minister, with all due respect, I need, need for you to repeat that, 'cause I'm not quite getting it, and if I don't get it, I'm not gonna be able to go back to my office to interpret you properly.  And these words, your story, is so valuable.  So I need you to answer that question again and make it a little bit shorter, if you don't mind."  He looked at me.  He said, "Is that the way you see it, my brother?"  I said, "Yes sir, that's the way I see it."  He said, "Fine, then that's the way it is."  So we did it again and we got it right.  My point is whenever I see him to this day, he always says, "Thank you so much for giving me my voice, for giving me my clarity, for helping me tell my story the right way--so extraordinary."  But there was an awkward moment 'cause I'm, I'm in his home, and this is a cover story, and it's his first cover story.  So it's like, what do I do?  I don't want to upset him, but I know that I need--as a journalist, I need to understand what I'm doing 'cause I, I can't--I don't--I don't want a correction saying that, [HistoryMaker] Clarence Waldron got it all wrong.  You know, I didn't want no lie--I didn't want no libel lawsuit either, so we gone get this straight right now.  And he was--you know, he, he understood my job, so we have a good, good connection with each other.
Speaker 2: I was gonna ask you about the venue, because, you know, he lives in a compound with the Fruit of Islam outside guarding it I mean.  Wa- was it intimidating to go (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, now that's part of it--why it's so challenging, you know.  Yes it was.  When I'm telling him, as, as sitting at his dining room table, interviewing him and asking him to repeat a question because Clarence Waldron didn't get it and I'm not pleased with, with your answer, I have security guards right behind me.  I also have--he has his own person--vid- recording the conversation.  So just (unclear), so it, it was--it was--yeah, it was--it was a little bit like oh, my god, am I gone lose this interview?  Is he gonna put me out of his house (laughter), you know?  But, fortunately, he understood.  He understood that I had a job to do, and he respected what I had to do, and it worked out well.  And we've done several--there were several stories after that first one.
Story_ID: 663775
Speaker 1: Is there anything about Minister Farrakhan that surprised you, that, that you didn't expect?
Speaker 2: Hm (pause). Yeah, there's a part of him that is just, just like the guy next door.  He has that energy.  I know at one point during the interview--one of our third or fourth interviews we did [for Jet].  We did a series of 'em.  There's pictures that I have of us just sitting there laughing like we're--like longtime buddies, just sitting there just laughing.  He had a sense of humor--a sense of humor.  People forget that Minister Farrakhan is also a great musician.  He plays the violin--classically trained violinist.  And I know there's a CD [compact disc] that he's been working on that'll probably come out soon.  And he played that for me in the house.  I was like, wow.  So there's that, that side of him that, that side of him--that sensitive side or whatever.  But--and then for him to have played the violin just for me, a private concert, that was, was amazing.  So, yeah--so, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, were, were you allowed to shoot the house?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, we took plenty, plenty of photographs.  Vandell Cobb was with me, and we took plenty of photographs, oh yeah--oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Now were, were you allowed to just shoot whatever you wanted or was it--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, no.  Your--he, he knew a photographer was coming with me--yes, taken, you know.  So we had the casual pictures of us just sitting there laughing with his wife [Betsy Ross Walcott; Khadijah Farrakhan].  She made a joke, and we were, like, looking at her laughing, you know, kind of thing.  Yeah, no, no, no it was--yeah, yeah.  So Louis Farrakhan, [HistoryMaker] Minister Louis Farrakhan, excuse me, certainly one of my top favorite, favorite interview--interview subjects and, like I said, the most challenging, but, but it--but it--but it made sense and it let me know who I am.  And a matter of fact, when we did that interview--when we did that interview, we were ready to leave.  He said, "Brother, I want you to wait a minute, and I'll be right back downstairs."  I said, "Okay." I'm saying, what is this?  So we're sitting there waiting, then he comes down, and he has a letter addressed to Mr. Johnson--Mr. John H. Johnson [HistoryMaker John H. Johnson], the owner of the company [Johnson Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois].  And when I--he said, "Give this to Mr. Johnson when you get back.  But actually," he said, "read it now."  I said, "Okay," so I read it.  And what he was saying to Mr. Johnson was, "Thank you so much for sending [HistoryMaker] Clarence Waldron my way.  Questions were relevit- relevant, sensitive.  I admire his confidence, and I know this is gonna be a superb story."  I was floored, for him to stop right there to say thank you, and to make sure that the owner of my company understood that he understood that we had something hot happening here.  I, I admire  that's-- I still have that letter as well.  So he was--he was a class act.  He's a class act.
Story_ID: 663776
Speaker 1: Likewise, I'm just thinking about other Chicago [Illinois] celebrities of that--of national stature like that.  Did, did you interview Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] at all [for Jet]?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  We have so many stories on, on, on Jesse.  Yeah, another extraordinary person who's--who I'm still in, you know, contact with today.  I brought my students down for a private conference--press conference with Reverend Jackson just a few months ago--extraordinary.  And, you know, we, we, we talk all the time.  So, yeah, yeah, Jesse's you know--Je- Jesse was--is--was--like, he was a go- godson basically to Mr. Johnson [HistoryMaker John H. Johnson], so there's a lot of connection there.  So I knew the whole family for all these years--all of 'em, the kids and Mrs. Jackson [Jacqueline Brown Jackson], everyone, yes.
Story_ID: 663777
Speaker 1: Was there ever a time when you conducted an interview and it just fell apart, nothing happened right, and you didn't get what you wanted and--?
Speaker 2: No, I always say that you may not get what you want, but you--you'll get what you need.  And all I need--all I need is a good story, and I've been able to get that because you have to follow the story.  So I, I know that Aretha Franklin gave me--when she was mysteriously ill a few years ago, she gave me at least four exclusive interviews.  And--but she never said what the illness was to, to this day.  And I said well--to myself--this is not gonna be much, but guess what?  It was just enough.  It was one of--it was one--it was the biggest seller in 2011 for Jet on the newsstand, so it did well.  It did well.  She, she talked around--she just talked about going to the doctor; health concerns; when something's wrong, check it out; if your doctor says--you think you're okay, but you feel you're not, speak up.  Whatever, whatever it was, the story went--we went global.  They were quoting Jet magazine in London [England], in Paris [France], all over the world, 'cause it was the first time that she had spoken about the mysterious illness.  So I got what I wanted, and I got what I need, which was a good story.
Speaker 1: Well, magazines like Ebony and Jet, Cosmopolitan even, Sports Illustrated, magazines that deal with--People magazine--that deal with celebrities,  I know they--there's--there are some unwritten rules about putting celebrities--certain pictures on the cover that sell more than others, but can't wear 'em out, you know.  So what, what was--was there any philosophy like, like that and--I mean, did, did you--did you--
Speaker 2: I think--for--I think for the Jet readers, they never got tired of Michael Jackson.  They never got tired of Whitney Houston.  They never got tired of Aretha, you know.  So our--the, the Jet audience is very loyal audience.  And we knew who the hottest ones were, so nah, we never got anything--oh, why he putting Michael Jackson on the cover?  Never, never, never heard that--never heard no complaints about the subject--the subjects.  You know what I mean?  Nah.
Speaker 1: Likewise, were there complaints about somebody new coming on the cover that nobody--you know--I mean, was, was there a debate about well, you can't put them up there yet; they're not big, big enough yet or?
Speaker 2: I don't--I don't recall any--anything like that.  I mean, Anita Baker--those who got their first cover early on deserved them, and, and the retur- and the favor was returned 'cause they did well.  They sold the cover as well, so--you know, so no, I, I don't--I'm not aware of anything like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what, what about feedback from the readers?  You know, what story did you get the most feedback about?
Speaker 2: That's, that's a tough one.  Of course, Minister Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan] was a big one.  That was a big one.  People just love Aretha Franklin, so whenever I wrote about Aretha, I always got a lot--tons of letters.  People loved her, especially during her illness.  People were praying for her and sending me gifts to give to her.  She's very well loved and respected in our community--in, in the world obviously.  But, no, usually, you know, people would call.  You, you get a lot of phone calls.  Sometimes, you know, we don't write; we'll call and say, "Oh, I like that story," you know, and so and so and so, you know, "Anita Baker this--," or whatever.  But no, pretty much people respond probably pretty well to, to, to the obvious stories.
Story_ID: 663778
Speaker 1: Now did you get involved with National Association of Black Journalists [NABJ] here in--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yes, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  By the time I got to Chicago in '82 [1982], I remember going to the regional convention in Detroit [Michigan] back in maybe '83 [1983], '84 [sic. 1982], yeah.  So I've, I've been--I've been there.  I've been in and out.  And they had something here, UNITY [UNITY: Journalists for Diversity].  I was at, at that one.  So--and I'm also a member of the local chapter, the Chicago Chapter [National Association of Black Journalists Chicago Chapter], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, is that--now the, the--I know you don't work for the Defender [Chicago Defender] but what, what was your relationship with the Defender staff over there like [HistoryMaker] Earl Calloway and all other people?  Did, did--was there any, any interaction?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I would love to see Earl Calloway out at the concerts and Teesee--Teesee--can't remember the last name of this mook--
Speaker 1: Hooks, Fambro Hooks [HistoryMaker Theresa Fambro Hooks].
Speaker 2: Fambro Hooks, absolutely, absolutely, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I know that I haven't seen her--I've se- I've seen her recently.  She's still out there doing it.  I haven't seen Earl Calloway in a while, but last I heard he's, you know, he's, he's doing well.  So, yeah, the, the, tho- those are Chicago legends.  You know what I mean?  Those are Chicago legends, absolutely.  And they were--and they've been very generous to me, because they've--they have had me in the, the, the Defender several times, so yeah, they've been very--especially Teesee.  She's been very, very generous to me.
Story_ID: 663779
Speaker 1: Do you have a, a favorite interview of all the people you've interviewed?
Speaker 2: Anything (laughter), anything I've done with Aretha [Aretha Franklin] is a favorite.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Anytime I talk to her is just always fun, insightful.  Aretha's my favorite interview subject hands down.  I just--I love her, and Maya [HistoryMaker Maya Angelou] as well, but Aretha--anything with Aretha is fun.  Maya is informative, educational, uplifting.  And Aretha is always interesting, intriguing.  She's very, very intriguing, so.  Yeah, I know Aretha--Aretha's my girl, absolutely.
Story_ID: 663780
Speaker 1: I have a, a note here that you interviewed [HistoryMaker] President Barack Obama.  Was, was it as president or before?
Speaker 2: This was during, during his campaign time.  That story is very interesting, how I met him before I knew.  Again, go back to the thing.  Whoever you meet, be respectful because you don't never know who is gonna become the next who.  We had the same barber here in town, Zariff, Zariff at Hyde Park Hair Salon [Chicago, Illinois] over on 53rd Street or whatever.  And I remember years ago, I am the kind of person I'm on deadline, I'm busy, I'm writing a story.  I remember rushing into barbershop, says to Zariff, "I'm, I'm on deadline.  I need to get this haircut."  It was around 12:30 in the af- no, was it 12:30?  I think it was 12:30 in the afternoon.  He said, "Well, Clarence, I have the senator coming in right now.  He should be here any minute."  And I looked, and he could tell I was, like, disappointed.  "Oh, but I'm on this story that I gotta get back to the office with, and then I'm traveling out of town on assignment."  He said, "Ah, come on, man, let's do it."  He's doing it; less than five minutes, in walks Barack Obama.  And I remember he had a brown suit on, and he was carrying the Chicago Tribune.  He came in, sat right down, and then Zariff said, "Oh, senator, do you know [HistoryMaker] Clarence Waldron with Jet magazine?"  He says, "No, I--no, I don't."  Actually, he didn't say that.  He just said, "Do you know Clarence Waldron?"  He said, "No I don't."  He said, "Clarence, this is the Senator Obama," so I shook his hand, he sat down, opened up his, his Tribune--with his Tribune--never seemed agitated, never seemed worried like, why am I waiting here?  And--not that kind of person.  Years--I mean, months later, he starts--he runs for U.S.--and I'm doing an interview with him.  And I said, "You know, I--I'm the one who stole your appointment at the barbershop."  He said, "What?"  And then we laughed about Zariff and all that kind of stuff.  So, yeah--so then I did several stories on him during that time.  And we'd catch him when, when he was campaigning here in Chicago [Illinois].  We have a picture of us together, you know, laughing.  And when I'm telling him that story again, we always get, get a big kick out of that.  So, again, you never know.  Now he's president of the United States.  See, so you never know.  Be polite.  I tell everybody just be polite.  You know, just be--be who you are, but be, be honest and be, be polite.  You never know.
Story_ID: 663781
Speaker 1: Now you usually interview African American celebrities, but you interviewed Tony Bennett.
Speaker 2: I did Tony Bennett, Tony Bennett.  Again, I learned early on know a news hook.  Well, you know, having Bob Johnson [Robert E. Johnson], the top editor of Jet, as my mentor, Bob would always find the black angle.  "There's a black angle to everything," is what Bob used to say--hm.  Tony Bennett, the black influence on, on his music is amazing.  People don't know that Pearl Bailey was the one who discovered him and took him over to Bob Hope to say, "Bob Hope, we need--you need to work with this young kid named Tony Bennett."  You know, people don't know how much Tony Bennett loved Duke Ellington and Count Basie and recorded with them.  People don't know that Tony Bennett on one of Duke El- El- Ellington's birthdays, when Duke had, had passed, was absolutely here in Chicago [Illinois] at the Ritz-Carlton [Ritz-Carlton Chicago] painting a portrait of Duke Ellington to give to his family.  He loved Duke Ellington.  He loved the black entertainers.  And so the story was on his influence, how they influenced him.  You know what I mean?  So it was--it was an amazing thing--a little bit different.  You don't quite hear that.  Of course, we dealt with the civil rights, you know, stuff that he did too.  You know, he, he, he marched and gave money to Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and Coretta Scott King as well.  But we, we sort of knew that a little bit, but you sort of forget the influence, the black influence, on his music--you know, Billy Eckstine, Joe Williams.  He just loved to be with those guys and learn from them, so.  He is a real good--real good guy, and he told me he sent me a portrait--well, a painting that he did, 'cause remember he's an artist.  And he, you know, sent something like, you know, thank you that was my, my best story.  You really looked beyond the obvious, something like that.  So, again, a generous, thoughtful kind of man, you know, who remembers.  And I remember I was up at--up at an Ella Fitzgerald concert at Carnegie Hall in New York [New York], and I saw Tony and remem- , "Ah, hey, hey."  You know, we hug--you know, hugged each other, whatever, and then came time to go backstage.  Well, Ella Fitzgerald's people did not give anybody a backstage pass, so the security said no one goes--no one could go--goes--ca- can backstage.  And then when he said that, looked up.  He said, "Oh, you're Tony Bennett."  And he said, "Yeah, uh-huh, I'm Tony Bennett."  He said, "Oh, oh, well, it's okay for you."  And then Tony said, "Well, they're with me.  They're with me. [HistoryMaker] Clarence Waldron, he's with me," and we all go--that kind of person.  He could be like, "Oh forget you; forget 'y'all," you know, but that's Tony Bennett.  Those are the mut- those are my kind of people, yeah, good guy--good guy.
Story_ID: 663782
Speaker 1: Now you interviewed Jennifer Hudson too, who's a local woman from Chicago [Illinois], raised in Englewood.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And she had a, you know, tremendous rise to fame, tremendous talent, but also had a horrible tragedy too.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, with Jennifer we were always together with her--right--even before 'American Idol' days cause her cousin used to work for the Johnson company [Johnson Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois], so she had us voting for her.  So we were all aware of her.  And then once--you know, she didn't win, but once the career began to take off, Jennifer was always available, you know, for a comment, always available for an interview.  And even--you know, even--I covered the tragedy.  At that point she was not able to talk, which we understood that, but she always was willing to talk.  She remembered, you know, this early support, you know, just all of the whole company voting for her.  All that mattered, you know, to her.  Although she didn't win, but her, her career was--has been--is tremendous, yeah.
Story_ID: 663783
Speaker 1: Now you've been recognized as a dean of the arts and entertainment writers and you know, editors by the National Association of Black Journalists [NABJ].
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: You know, right.
Speaker 2: Yep,
Speaker 1: The--yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I got that honor in 2010, and I remember the person who nominated me.  The committee was headed by Greg Dunmore and Patrick Riley.  They were head of this committee, and it felt--they felt that I at that point was doing this consistently on a national level a little bit longer than most people had.  And they felt that, you know, it's time for you to be recognized.  You're unsung.  You've helped shape kit--launch some of--some of the biggest careers in, in, in, in pop culture, so we think that--you know, that, that you're the one.  So it was amazing, again, how life comes together.  'Cause I got the letter saying we wanna honor you on Aunt Catherine's [Catherine Culver] birthday.  I'll never forget that.  And again, she had died a year before, so the fact that I--that came then, really touched my spirit.  Again, her lessons of following your passion and no matter what sticking to your dream and your goal, it all came full circle.  And so yes, so they--so just--so they named me the dean of arts and entertainment reporters.  So even today people call me the dean.  And it made the L.A. Sentinel [Los Angeles Sentinel] front page: Dean Clarence Waldron [HistoryMaker Clarence Waldron], and all that kind of stuff, so.  And even at Northwestern [Medill School of Journalism; Medill School of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communications, Evanston, Illinois] where I teach now, they ca- they call me the dean.  They call me the dean.
Speaker 1: So the, the, the timing of it was just fortuitous.  It wasn't like they planned to do it on Aunt Catherine's--
Speaker 2: Nope.
Speaker 1: --bir- birthday.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, so when I, I got the letter saying, "We wanna honor you," on her birthday, that just wore me out.  And I just felt, again, spirit connecting, that she is looking down on me, and this is--this is what she, she would want me to do, go all the way with, with my passion.
Story_ID: 663784
Speaker 1: Now you've interviewed like Steve Harvey, Tom Joyner, [HistoryMaker] Herb Kent, and some of the other disc jockeys and personalities that, that are--these men are well known in the community (unclear)--pe- people know their face, even though they hear 'em on the radio mostly, but they know who they are.  But a lot of people don't know who you are, even though you're dean and the journalists know, know you, but the average person doesn't really pay as much attention as to who's writing the article or doesn't see you as a--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and guess what?  I like that (laughter).  I've been around too many people in the public light, too many famous people.  I don't wanna be famous.  I was even reluctant to, to do this interview today.  I--Julieanna Richardson, who runs The HistoryMakers, she's asked me for years to come do this, and I've always found a way to wiggle my way out of it.  I don't require being in the front row of the public spotlight.  I'm very comfortable over there observing you and interpreting what you're doing.  I don't need that.  So this is--I'm, I'm a reluctant interviewee today (laughter).  That's just not who I--what, what I require.
Speaker 1: How's that feel, though, to--I mean, you can go--you can--you've really got it both ways.  You can--ce- celebrities know you.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm, yeah, I mean, bottom, bottom line what you do you can pull it out when you want to.  So when I wanna be just [HistoryMaker] Clarence Waldron, you know, the guy from the hood, the guy from East Orange [New Jersey], I'm, I'm happy with doing that.  So I'm happy when I'm Clance, and I'm happy when I'm Clarence Waldron.  I, I--and I, I get--I get that; and I get that.  When folks do recognize or wanna talk about a story that I've done [for Jet] or a student that I've inspired, I'm fine with that.  I'm fine with that.  But, you know, I don't require being front row center.  I do not require that.
Story_ID: 663785
Speaker 1: Now you started teaching in 1998?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yep an adjunct at Northwestern University Medill School of Journalism [Medill School of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communications, Evanston, Illinois], and I'm, I'm there now.  And I'm also teaching a class at Columbia College Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  Again, I've (unclear) how to how life goes.  My professor from J school [Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, New York, New York], Phyl Garland [Phyllis Garland], she's a graduate of Northwestern Medill School of Journalism.  I think the year I was born or right around that time were the first black female graduates of the--of the university.  And around before she died--about a year before she died, she sent me two boxes of her syllabus, her books, and her notes, and everything, all the classes that, that she taught.  So she, she knew what she was doing, and she sent it Federal Express [FedEx] to me.  And I really--I knew--I knew what that meant.  'Cause I've--I (unclear)--I've, I've followed her in different ways, from the Johnson days [at Johnson Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois] to the teaching days--you know what I mean--to the writing book days that I'm in the middle of now.  So, yeah, Phyl Garland, like I said earlier, amazing im- impact on me, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so what's the most important thing you try to impart to your students?
Speaker 2: Accuracy, accuracy, accuracy.  Joseph Pulitzer said that is the most important ingredient in this business, accuracy.  We have a policy.  If you get a factual error wrong, you get an F on the assignment, and that's, that's, that's how you--that's how you do it.  And that's for my graduate students and my undergraduates as well.  We, we, we have this thing called the Medill F up at Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois], which I definitely, you know, adhere to, you know.  That's the most important thing.  I think the next thing after that is, of course, just your integrity, how you carry yourself.  I tell them that everyone in this room is a great writer I assume because you're here.  However, what's gonna separate you when you graduate is your character.  Can people work with you?  Can you work with them?  Do people like you?  And this, this is all about--everything's about relationships.  Do people feel good about you?  Do they have confidence in you?  So I, I teach--I teach that--but accuracy and then your character, credibility.  Having the credibility that--that's important.

Speaker 1: When you look back at your career--now you retired in twenty--
Speaker 2: Twenty eleven [2011].
Speaker 1: --eleven [2011].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Make me sound old, retired. We'll say I early retired, early retired.
Speaker 1: Yes, all right.
Speaker 2: That's a better word, thank you (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right, neglected to point that out.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But your, your--now what, what--I mean, what prompted you to early retire?
Speaker 2: It was time; the industry is changing; the magazine is going to a different way; there are publicists going out of business; and there are so many more things that I want to do that I put on--put up over there because the Jet days and years it took a hundred percent out of me.  So there are some things that I've been wanting to do for a long time and that is including moving into the book world, which is where I am--where, where I am now.
Speaker 1: In terms of the changing industry, I mean, you talked about earlier joining Jet in like a golden age.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Mr. Johnson's alive.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: When the building existed on Michigan Avenue--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --people would come to Chicago [Illinois], black people, white people too would go to visit the building.
Speaker 2: Just to look--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --to beg for a tour, just to walk through.  And the tours were free.  They were free.  But they just wanted just to--just--they understood this was living American--black American history, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: I remember my first visit was to visit Hoyt Fuller [Hoyt W. Fuller] with a friend of mine.  He was being pub- published, and just to going in, in there was a--
Speaker 2: So you can imagine what it was like to work there, to be a part of that every day, just to be a part of that, that, that symbol of success and, and, and dreams coming true kind of energy.
Speaker 1: Yeah, mentioning Hoyt Fuller just I have to catch my train of thought of, but men- mentioning Hoyt Fuller reminded me of, of Le- [HistoryMaker] Lerone Bennett, who we have not discussed at all.  But tell us about Lerone Bennett.
Speaker 2: Again, again, in, in this world I--and I hope I've said it enough times.  You know, if you look carefully, there are living angels around you helping you get where you are.  I did not make it through, you know, graduate school by myself.  I had people who inspired and helped.  Lerone Bennett was one of those who helped me with my Johnson days [at Johnson Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois], one of my biggest supporters.  When there was a great story, he--he'd be right there with, with a note or some, some good words.  I saw him speak late 2013, and I walked up to him, and he said to me and as he said it, I picked it up instantly.  He said to me, "[HistoryMaker] John H. Johnson."  And I said, "John H. Johnson."  Then we hugged and embraced.  My point is Mr. Johnson was such an extraordinary man, and that's how we know each other.  That's how we respect each other.  You know what I mean?  I'm, I'm--I was the, the young editor coming up.  He was the senior editor--together, based on John Johnson's appreciation of our talent.  So that moment will always live with me, just--that's how we said hello.  We didn't say, "Hey, how you doing?  Great speech."  That came later.  John H. Johnson, it said everything.  It said everything that we feel, everything I feel about him, you know, yeah--powerful moment, powerful moment, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm glad I asked about him.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you can--you can't forget Lerone Bennett.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You cannot forget Lerone Bennett.  I mean, Lerone Bennett--how did we know it?  We see it, helped build an empire--helped build the empire, the Johnson empire.  So that's, that's--that history, history will show you that.  That is a fact, you know, so you can't talk about the Johnson days--I can't without mentioning him.  So I thank you for even, you know, reminding to please say something, yeah.
Speaker 1: While we're on the subject, who--I know you can't mention everybody, but who are some of the others that really inspired you at Johnson?
Speaker 2: Well, we said Bob Johnson [Robert E. Johnson], who was the editor of Ebony [sic. Jet].  We said Lerone Bennett.  Malcolm West, who was the managing editor for--he was my most immediate boss, another talented man--talented man, tough, tough editor on me a few times, you know, but it made my stories better.  So Malcolm West is another gifted man from, from the Johnson days, but those, those are the three that stand out the most.  There are some many more people, but those, those are in terms of editorial.  I could get into other departments (laughter).  I could get into HR [human resources] and other--Fashion Fair, but those are--those are the, the, the three.
Story_ID: 663787
Speaker 1: Do you have any reflections about the, the state of black publishing today, in terms of, you know, covering popular culture and, you know, with the things changing to digital and the and--
Speaker 2: Now--
Speaker 1: --and--
Speaker 2: --are you--are you asking me for a Jet, Ebony in particular or just in general?
Speaker 1: Well, in gen- well, particularly about Ebony and Jet.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, 'cause they, they were the, the--they--(unclear) still are of the flagship magazines--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --reflect what's going on in the black community.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I, I tend to talk more about my experience when I was there [Johnson Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois] then what--where we are--where we are today.  So I'm gonna choose to move on to another question.  I nothing to really say about today.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, but do, do you have anything to say in general about the state of affairs?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think just in general journalism--and I say this to my students--is, is at a--is at a fascinating place.  I mean, yes there's some questions about print and, you know, the economy, and the Internet, but because of the Internet there's some many great op- opportunities.  So and I think that we're at a--we're at an exciting place now.  I think that the only thing that I caution about is that so many--so many outlets want to be out there first and they're out there wrong.  And then once you're wrong, it's hard to pull back the information.  So, but I think that we're at an exciting place.  I think for young people coming up, the--they'll, they'll, they'll be work for them to do.  You know, I tell my students, you know, there, there, there's a place for you at the table, absolutely, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so you think the digital age brings more opportunities?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah and, and it's exciting and different ways to do it, and some of the bloggers are, are good.  You know, some are not real journalists, but those who are who do a little blogging on the side are, are amazing, you know, getting the story out there.  I think some of the citizenship--journalism citizen people doing--catching stuff on their--on their smartphones has elevated the--has elevated coverage.  I think it's a good thing that we hear more from the audience than, than we just figure out what the audience, audience wants to hear or read.  I think--I think that's a good part.  You know, it's a good part.  But I always tell my students be careful now.  There's a journalist who deals with facts, who's very careful, who wants to be first, but if the information is not clear and confirmed, (unclear) there.  So you rather, than just be late and let the other one take one, you wanna be accurate.  So long as you--we maintain that, everything's fine, but you wanna be accurate, and you may not be first because you're trying to be accurate.  But I'd rather--I'd rather be second then.  I'd rather be second, yeah--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --and it tends to make things move faster than ever, you know, yeah.  I mean, even, even right now, someone here at HistoryMakers [The HistoryMakers] they, they have me out on Twitter or Facebook saying that [HistoryMaker] Clarence Waldron's being interviewed today--(snaps fingers) moving fast, moving fast.  Interview isn't done yet so, you know, that's where we are.  So that's, that's, that's fascinating, yeah.
Story_ID: 663788
Speaker 1: Now when you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there anything major that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: I'm quick with that one.  I've no regrets at all.  I have no regrets at all.  I think things have happened when they happened, the way they should happen.  I'm very comfortable with, with things.  There's not much I would change in my life.  Actually, there's nothing I would change in my life.  I would still wanna be raised by the same family I was raised by.  I would still want to know my biological family and I do.  I would still want to be, you know, close to my brother and sister [Joyce Arnold]--now?  Sure.  Yeah, absolutely, there's nothing that I--that I have any regrets about or nothing that I'm angry about--no, no regrets, no regrets, no regrets.  And I thought about that question when I interviewed [HistoryMaker] Eartha Kitt.  It was her last interview--her last print interview before she died.  Her last public appearance was, of course, for The HistoryMakers ['An Evening With Eartha Kitt'].  We know that, but her last print thing was for Ebony.  And I asked her about the White House luncheon.  I said, "Here we are now, forty years later--fifty years later.  Do you have any regrets about, about what you said, what you did at the White House that upset Lady Bird Johnson?"  Without missing a beat, "No, no, not at all."  I said, "Even the fact that you had to leave the coun- ?" "Not at all." You know, and I, I, I admire that.  So I asked myself then do I have any regrets or anything, and no, no.  It--it's, it's--you know, it's all worked--all worked out.  I think that--I know that I've taken--and I may be moving too fast--but in terms of how when--remember there's so many facets to that, if I can go there right now.  Can I go there right now?  I'll go there right now.
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: I, I feel that--I know that I took what appeared to be a, a nothing life and made it all worthwhile.  I, I think that I was able to recognize my opportunities and I seize them.  I recognized my blessings and I got them.  So, yes, no regrets.  I'm, I'm--it--it's, it's all good.
Story_ID: 663789
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: This gun violence gotta stop.  I mean, I--it's to the point--and maybe I'm getting old, but I remember, you know, years ago 'cause I don't even watch the news anymore.  It's very depressing, espec- 'specially here in Chicago [Illinois].  All of these young people, teenagers, getting shot every weekend almost in Chicago.  It's, it's scary; it's scary.  That's gotta stop.  I don't where that's coming from.  I think that we need to have a panel of sociologists and psychologists get together to figure out what is this--what is this self-hatred black--black on black crime stemming from.  Why is this going on?  I'm, I'm at a loss for it, but it's frightening.  And it's so scary that kids can't go to school comfortably, you know.  That's--come on.  And then people can't--with this violence people don't want--don't wanna go to work.  It's just--it's just scary; it's scary, you know.  And it's--I say black because that's, that's my--where, where I am, but it's, it's across the board, some of these, these shootings now--you know what I mean--in these schools and in movie theaters.  Huh?  What, what, what have we--what have we come to?  You know, we've reduced ourselves to this?  This is life?  So now that--I'm very concerned with the gun violence, especially amongst our young people--all the dreams, all the things that we'll never hear of.  'Cause you never know who could be the next one who could make a difference, who could be the next one who could become the, the, the scientist, the researcher to find a cure for cancer.  We don't know.  We don't know.  You know what I mean?  So I'm very concerned about that.
Story_ID: 663790
Speaker 1: In terms of your family, now did you ever get married or have children, or--?
Speaker 2: No, no I have not, nope, nope, nope, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, and I know you said your father [Waldron's foster father, Alexander Culver] died in, in--when you were in high school.  And when you were sixteen did--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --did your foster mother [Bertha Hill Culver] live until--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --to see you become a success?
Speaker 2: She lived through my Atlantic City days [at The Press of Atlantic City].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, through my Atlantic City [New Jersey] days, yeah, yeah.  But she, she had seen the Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] and all that kind of stuff.  So, yeah, so she, she knew.  She knew everything was gonna be just fine, yeah, and told me that--said, "No, you'll be just fine."  "Oh, you think I'll be all right?"  "You'll be just fine."
Speaker 1: Okay, of course, your--
Speaker 2: Sure did.
Speaker 1: --aunt Catherine [Catherine Culver] li- lived to see--
Speaker 2: Oh, she lived--she lived through it all.  She died in 2009, so she saw it all.  Yeah, she saw it all, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you kind of feel like you have an extended family or--with all--with all the people that you've discussed in this interview or around--
Speaker 2: You know, it's funny I--I've, I've never married.  I've had good, good relationships, but I do know--given my, my background and given my child- childhood, I do find that family is the most important thing for me.  I, I noticed as I was trying to find photographs for today's interview, I could not find [HistoryMaker] Clarence Waldron, professional.  I found Clarence Waldron with the families that he's adopted--informally adopted.  You know, I have kids who call me granddad.  I got nephews and nieces within the family, outside the family--family, family.  And also I guess what I've tried to do without knowing it until I reflect, given the fact that I know that growing up wasn't always easy for me, my, my mission has been to make other, other people's lives better just in general.  I'm just--my job is to make everyone's life, you know, better and certainly youn- young folks.  So I think that I've done that pretty well too, you know, yeah.  But I also know--I said this--someone asked me a similar question.  I think that you get out of life what you put in it.  You determine what you really, really want.  And knew that the most important thing for me was to find a way to earn respect in this world.  That was the most important thing for me.  I wanted to make sure that I was more than just another statistic from New Jersey.  It's very important that I have respect in this world, and that's what I worked on.  After I succeeded, may not have done as well in the personal relationships as I could have, or as I can now, if I--if I didn't put the extra energy it, you know.  But I remember something that Dorothy Donegan, who's a great piano player, she said--she got married but divorced.  I said, "Are you dating now?"  She said, "You know what?  I'm done with that.  I find that what I want is my career now.  I want to play my piano," and she said in her case, "I play my piano. It will not yell at me. It will not hit me. It will not abuse me. It will not cheat on me. It will not make me an unhappy person."  I got what she was saying.  So, again, you choose, choose what you want, you know.  And, and--but if you--you got to put the extra work in it, you know, so.  So, I've, I've done pretty well in balancing, balancing my life out I think--you know, pretty, pretty well balanced, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Someone joked, not like La Baker [Josephine Baker], in terms of adopting kids, but informally I've adopted families.  Everyone that you--that you'll ever hear me talk about--if I talk about them, they're not just a friend, they're a family friend.  Family is important, and I find that I'm always reaching out for that.  So, we're not gonna get into a psychology session right now, but we, we know where it comes from.  Family is very important to me, but also I know that family is not your--so your blood family.  It is a people who are there for you when you need them.  It's as simple and as true as that.  People who love you unconditionally, those are your families.  People, some you can choose; some you won't.  That's people who are there when you need them is, is where, where it is.
Story_ID: 663791
Speaker 1: Now is there anything I haven't asked you about we need to talk about before I ask my last question.
Speaker 2: Oh, let me see.  Did we--did we cover it all?  There's something else I wanna say about this family thing.  I mentioned [HistoryMaker] Eartha Kitt.  We had a very--not strained, but very good connection.  'Cause remember, she was abandoned by her, her parents and was sent to live with some woman that she was told was her aunt [Mamie Kitt] in New York [New York].  And in our last interview, I asked her about, about that.  'Cause she once said that whenever she's on stage, she's trying to win her mother's approval, trying to win her mother's hand.  I asked her that at probably eighty years old.  "How do you--you know, how do you feel?"  She said, "That is still true to this day.  The applause that I've received is my mother's acceptance."  And that just stood, stood out with me.  And she said when I met her at HistoryMakers [The HistoryMakers]--in person 'cause it was over the phone interviews, she said, "You're the one--you get me.  You understand."  I said, "Well, we have a lot in common.  We have a lot in common."  So anyway, I just say that in my case I think that I worked hard to not win mother's [Waldron's biological mother, Constance Waldron] acceptance, acceptance, but to win acceptance in society.  That's still the most important thing that I could've--I could've done for myself is to make something happen for [HistoryMaker] Clarence Waldron, to take what looked bad, didn't look like it could go anywhere, and make it go.  I made my life go.  With the grace of God I made my life go, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, I think that's it.  It think we're done.
Speaker 2: That is all (laughter) (claps hands).
Speaker 1: Thank you, sir.
Speaker 2: Thank you, thank you.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: This was fun.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This was fun.

Speaker 2: This is my biological grandmother.  This is my--this is--I was my father's--my father's mother, Grandma Kay [ph.], who just came into my life about twenty years ago.  We found each other.  I found her soon after my biological father [Clarence Harris] died, ironically.
Speaker 1: And here we are again, my grandmother, one of our first pictures together down at her home in Oxford, North Carolina, Grandma Kay.
Speaker 2: Fifth grade school teacher, Mrs. Betty Neals, who inspired me, encouraged me, sang Dionne Warwick songs to me and song in class.
Speaker 1: This is my aunt Catherine again with the great dancer, [HistoryMaker] Katherine Dunham at Katherine Dunham's house.  We spent the entire afternoon with her.  And it was one of the biggest thrills for my aunt, because she absolutely idolized Katherine Dunham and dance, and was a dancer herself.
Speaker 2: About what year was that?
Speaker 1: That was 2000--1999, 2000, yes.
Speaker 2: This obviously Dionne Warwick.  We're at a concert with my aunt in Newark, New Jersey, where we're all from.  And it was--I was--Aunt Catherine was the one who sent me to my very first Dionne Warwick concert and taught me to follow my passion for music and the arts.
Speaker 1: Here we are again at Katherine Dunham's home in New York City, and again, 1999 I believe it was.  And we--a long afternoon together, and my aunt did not want to go home.
Speaker 2: One of my--one of my favorite entertainers.  I have three and this is one of 'em, Ms. Nancy Wilson [HistoryMaker Nancy Wilson].  I always say that she retired in 2011 from music, and that's when I retired from the magazine, same year.
Speaker 1: This is Johnny Mathis and Dionne Warwick backstage at the Holiday Star Theatre [ph.].  That's 1989--1989, and that was my first time meeting Johnny Mathis, who was the family favorite.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION).
Speaker 1: This is the [HistoryMaker] Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan in his home here in Chicago.  This is our first picture together, 2000.  It was for his first Jet cover story.
Speaker 2: And this is perhaps our second time together. We're sitting in his dining room of his home here in Chi- Chicago doing the interview.  Was very fortunate that I was able to do repeat business with a lot of people through the years--repeat interviews.
Speaker 1: Nineteen ninety-four [1994] with the legendary Lena Horne.  That's her daughter, Gail [Gail Lumet Buckley], in the background, and Lena is signing her most recent CD [compact disc] for me in this picture.  And she had just finished a concert at Carnegie Hall in New York, 1994.
Speaker 2: Tony Bennett, one of my favorite interview subjects through the years.  We're together here in Chicago, and I think he even signed that for me: to Clarence, my great friend, Tony Bennett.
Speaker 1: This [HistoryMaker] Eartha Kitt's last public appearance.  This picture was taken here at The HistoryMakers headquarters after a taping, 'An Evening With Eartha Kitt,' sponsored by The HistoryMakers--Eartha Kitt.
Speaker 2: Aretha Franklin and I, one of my all-time favorite singers and newsmakers.  This is probably twenty years ago at least.  We're at the House of Blues here in Chicago.
Speaker 1: This is Aretha again, and now we're at 2012, at the Trumpet Awards in Atlanta [Georgia], in which she received an honor on behalf of her late father, the Reverend C. L. Franklin.
Speaker 2: This is Aretha, 2007, at her birthday party at Tavern on the Green in New York City.  You see that I'm interviewing her and we're having a great time--Tavern on the Green, Aretha Franklin, 2007.
Speaker 1: Ha, another living angel of mine, Dr. Maya Angelou [HistoryMaker Maya Angelou].  This is 2006.  This is our very first picture together.  She's been a great inspiration to me, great, great, great woman.
Speaker 2: Hah, Anita Baker, 1987, here in Chicago, I wanna say the Arie Crown Theater.  We, we I was there with her at the very beginning of her career, and we are still in touch now--great time--Anita Baker.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] John H. Johnson, the founder of Ebony and Jet magazines.  I am getting an award on my fifth anniversary with the company [Johnson Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois].  This is 1987.
Speaker 1: This is the part of the award that I received when I was named the dean of entertainment journalists by the National Association of Black Journalists [NABJ].  This was in 2010.  And you see that Aretha Franklin, Dionne Warwick, and Nancy Wilson sing his praises, my three favorite entertainers.

Speaker 1: This is The Black Collegian magazine that I used to write for when I was in college [Columbia University, New York, New York].  And this is an interview that I did.  My first published, published interview was with the singer, [HistoryMaker] Dionne Warwick.  We did an interview in 1978 when I was senior in college, and this ran in 1979 in The Black Collegian.  Love that picture.
Speaker 2: One of our many Jet covers on the legendary Lena Horne, the lady in the music of men in her life.
Speaker 1: Aretha Franklin and one of her many, many parties.  This one is her birthday bash.  We won't say what year.  She does not wanna give her age out.  Uh-huh, thirty-nine.

Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Eighty-five [1985].
Speaker 2: Yeah, 1985.
Speaker 1: Okay, 1986, Anita Baker's first cover story.

Speaker 1: My first interview with [HistoryMaker] Minister Louis Farrakhan.  He talked about his rela- 'lationship with Malcolm X, a very powerful one, very challenging.  My most challenging interview is right there, Louis Farrakhan.
Speaker 2: Here's Dionne Warwick, her cousin, Whitney Houston, and Dionne Warwick's aunt, [HistoryMaker] Cissy Houston, Whitney's mother--they're first visit to the Johnson building [Johnson Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois].  And, and you see that Whitney signed the, the issue for me afterwards, very thoughtful.
Speaker 1: Luther Vandross and his very first Jet cover.
Speaker 2: Huh, okay, this is from the L.A. Sentinel [Los Angeles Sentinel], 2010.  This is when the NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists] saluted me and named me the dean of arts and entertainment journalists--Dean Clarence Waldron [HistoryMaker Clarence Waldron].
Speaker 1: We all know this, this man, extraordinary president of the United States of America, [HistoryMaker] President Barack Obama.  Yes, this was during the campaign days.
