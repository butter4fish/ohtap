Speaker 1: I want first to talk about your father, Eddie Lewis. And I'd like to know what you know, what--for you to tell us what you know about his background and where he was from originally. His parents, you know.
Speaker 2: My father was born in Alabama of poor, very poor parents.  They were sharecroppers, tenant farmers. He had a wonderful mother that I never met and a wonderful father. I listened to my father tell me the story of his parents and his siblings. He worked in the fields, and later in what they call turpentine farms,  'cause they got turpentine from trees. And sometime he would work two and three different jobs to help support his family and to survive, in rural Alabama.

Speaker 1: Why do I have New Albany, Georgia.
Speaker 2: I don't know. They lived in Georgia, near Albany, but he was born in Alabama.
Speaker 1: Did he share any stories about his growing up with you?
Speaker 2: Not much.  My father [Eddie Lewis] didn't talk a great deal. He spent most of his time working and telling us to follow the straight and narrow. He didn't like to talk about the hard and difficult time. He warned us as children about the night riders. He was referring to the [Ku Klux] Klan that would march through the area where they lived in both Alabama and later in Georgia.

Speaker 1: Your mother, Willie Mae Lewis, what do you know about her and her, you know, her background?
Speaker 2: My mother was born in 1914, in rural Pike County, Alabama, in a section called, 'Carter's Quarters.' Her grandfather and her great grandfather were all born in the same area. So I got to know my mother's father, my grandfather, and my great-grandfather. And they all grew up in the same area, on the same plantation, as a matter of fact. She grew up with eight brothers and one sister. And it was like a unbelievable large community of Carter.  Her maiden name is Carter. And they lived on one person's land named, Copeland. Josh Copeland, in rural Pike County, Alabama--about fifty miles from Montgomery [Alabama], outside of a little town called, Troy [Alabama]. I got to know my mother's folks much better than my father's [Eddie Lewis's] folks.
Speaker 1: And you speak in the book about how they even thought that they were better than others.  Because they had more. They had sort of a history and they sort of had more than the, you know, others in the area?
Speaker 2: My grandfather and my great-grandfather were very, very proud. They were living on a plantation, but somehow and some way they were able to pool their resources. They worked very hard.  And they thought somehow even in their poverty that they were a little better than others. And my mother didn't like that about her own people. She thought they had sort of a disdain for other folks.
Speaker 1: And did you--do you know how your parents met?
Speaker 2: I really don't. I heard my mother say that she saw my father at church. And she saw this short man.  And everybody was calling him, 'Shorty.' And she just fell in love with him, on first sight. But I think it was at a church, in rural Alabama.

Speaker 1: I'd like to go through your siblings.  You know, from the oldest to the youngest.  It was Ora?
Speaker 2: Ora.  Ora had a birthday just a few days ago. She turned sixty-five. She just retired. She had lived in New York and later in Detroit [Michigan]. And in recent weeks she's been spending time in rural Alabama with my mother [Willie Mae Lewis], who's eighty-six. My next sibling is my older brother. His name is Edward. He was born deaf. And we grew up together. And I never learned sign language but we--all of us were able to communicate with him. He worked very hard, and he knew everything. I remember when we first got the television, that he had something to do with the buying of the television. And he didn't want my younger brothers or sisters to be playing this television. And what he would do, he would come back to the house if he had been out to feel the television to determine whether it was warm or not, and to know whether it had been played.  We have a younger sister and her name is Ethel.  And he started calling her 'Mimi.'  'Cause he couldn't say Ethel, apparently. And so Mimi became her nickname. And so today, we all call her Mimi. I'm the third child in the family. And next to me is a brother by the name of Adolph who's deceased. He was a wonderful, loving brother, who moved to Florida and raised five children there.
Speaker 1: And then what about Sandy?
Speaker 2: Well then the next one would be William, who lives in Detroit. He's married. He worked at Ford Motor Company for thirty years and he just retired. And they all worked on the farm--we all worked very, very hard growing up as children, raising cotton and corn and peanuts, hogs, cows and chickens. And William worked. And after William is Ethel--that's Mimi. She lives below Troy [Alabama], she's married with two children, and she work everyday as a salesperson at a local dress shop, in the little town of Troy. And after Mimi or Ethel is Freddie. Freddie is in Detroit. He was there with his wife and three--four children.  And he made a decision to moved his children and his wife back to Alabama some few years ago. He didn't want them to grow up in Detroit. And he continued to work there, and he'd come home at least once a month. But he's getting ready to retire also and moved back to Alabama. And my next brother is Samuel. Both Freddie and Samuel served in the military. Samuel served in Vietnam.  And he's married, and he worked for the Alabama Department of Transportation. One time he worked for the Coca-Cola Company.  The little bottling company there in Troy. And sometime my mother, she get us confused because we look so much alike. But it's not just that.  She called him Robert, and sometimes she call me Sam. And then she'd say, "Oh whatever your name.  You know which one I'm talking about." And he's a wonderful young brother. And then after Samuel is Grant. Grant lives right near my mother on the place--he built a very lovely home--and Samuel lives nearby also. And they're on the same place with their built homes. Grant work for a car dealership in Troy. He has three children and a wonderful wife. And my younger sibling is a sister.  Her name is Rosa. She live in California in Richmond. She's married with three children. Her youngest child is graduating from college in Illinois this spring.

Speaker 1: I want to go back to some of your earliest memories, you know, growing up. And I was wondering, you know, if you could share like two or three.  You know, when you were young.
Speaker 2: Well I remember very well when I was four years old. And I ask young people today, "Do you remember when you was four?" And the way I remember it so well--in 1944, when I was four years old, my father [Eddie Lewis] had saved three hundred dollars.  And with the three hundred dollars, he bought 110 acres of land. And I remember when we moved. I remember the very last load that we moved from this plantation. We were sitting in the back seat of a old broken down car. We had a dog, a white dog.  And this dog was named Riley. And we moved just up the road to this big house which had been--like on this farm--had been the big house. It was the largest house that I'd ever seen in my life. But it only had about three rooms--three big rooms and then, you came out on the porch and there was the kitchen. But you had to come out on the porch--come outside of the house and walk on the porch across the way to come to the kitchen. And it was a tin top house surrounded by pecan trees. And it was this very large pecan tree. And when a storm came up we always felt or thought, "This big pecan tree was going to fall on this house." And we had this well where you could stand on the front porch of this house and literally draw the water while you were standing on the--on the porch. It was a magnificent place that I will never forget. But the reason I remember, also--when I was 4, my mother [Willie Mae Lewis] had a garden. And in this garden that was sort of a pail, like what we call a bucket. And she would use it from time to time to water the vegetables when it became dry. And I can see that pail. I can see that bucket, now. But as a young child, when I was about five or six, I fell in love with raising chickens. I became very good at it, very good. And they used to call me the 'chicken boy'. I don't know what it was, but my mother would allow me to mark the eggs and place them under the setting hen and wait for the three long weeks for the little chicks to hatch. And people today ask me why did I mark the eggs with a pencil before I placed them under the setting hen? And I would say, "Well from time to time another hen would get on the nest and there would be some more eggs. And you had to be able to tell the fresh eggs from the eggs that were already under the setting hen." And when these little chicks would hatch, I would fool the setting hen. I would cheat on them. I would take these little chicks and give them to another hen or put them in a box with a lantern. Raise them on their own, get some more fresh eggs, mark them with a pencil, place them under the setting hen.  Encourage the setting hens to sit on the nest for another three weeks. And I became very good at it. And then people would come along and they'd change the eggs--because most of my eggs were hatched. You know, they didn't spoil. And I had all these little chicks. And some years, I'd raised forty or fifty or sixty.  And one year we raised almost 200. But I wanted to--I became very conscious of cheating on these setting hens.  Because after a hen stays on their nest for three weeks, they lose a lot of weight and they shed a lot of their feathers--their sort of underbelly. And I knew it was not the right thing to do as a young child. And I--we used to get the Sears & Roebuck catalog.  The big thick book, the catalog? We'd call it, the 'wish book'--I wish I had this, I wish I had that. And I kept on wishing that I could save $18.98, to order this hatchery from the Sears & Roebuck order house, in Atlanta [Georgia]. And I was not able to do it. And as a young child, child I wanted to be a minister. So one of my uncles--then I was about seven and a half, eight years old. So one of my uncles had Santa Claus to bring me a Bible. And from time to time with the help of my brothers and sisters and my first cousin, we would gather all our chickens together in the chicken house, and we would have church. The chickens, along with my sisters and brothers and my first cousins, would make up the congregation. And I would start speaking, or preaching.  And when I look back on it, some of these chickens would become very quiet. Some of these chickens would bow their heads. They never quite said, "Amen." But I'm convinced today that most of those chickens that I preached to in the '40s [1940s] and the '50s [1950s] tended to listen to me better than some of my colleagues listen to me today, in the [U.S.] Congress. And some of these chickens were a little more productive.  At least they produced eggs.
Speaker 1: That's so cute. So why do you think you wanted to be a minister then? Why? I mean, this is--you're young.  You're how old?
Speaker 2: I was only about seven and a half, eight years old. I went to Sunday school every Sunday--except the first Sunday, we went to a Methodist Sunday school, because that's where our first cousins were members of a church right down the road from us. And the rest of the other Sundays we went to a Baptist church for Sunday school where we were members. And I felt the need to preach.  I felt I had been called.  I wanted to be a minister. And I had been preaching to these chickens trying to save their souls.  And I used to even baptize them. When a chicken would die, we had a chicken funeral. My sisters and brothers and my first cousins would be the mourners and I would deliver the eulogy. So I really wanted to be a minister. And then I started preaching when I was sixteen in the church.
Story_ID: 18489
Speaker 1: How could you best describe the life here, you know, on the--you were share--you were part of a sharecropper--.
Speaker 2: Yeah. We grew up as sharecroppers, and later my father [Eddie Lewis] bought his land. But even then, we still would farm other land. And we had to rent the land or what they do--half of what you produce you had to share it with the landowner. We grew up very, very poor. I was saying to some of my staff people just a few days ago in a conversation that I had, "I don't understand how we survived. I don't understand how we survived." I don't know how my mother [Willie Mae Lewis] and father made it to--for the ten of us to grow up the way we did. And my mother would always say, "We have to do. We have to make do." I used to fuss with them as a child. She said I was a aggravated child. I used to fuss all the time, as a young child.  And say we--"This is like gambling. We plant a crop and then the rain or something come and all that, or it's a drought.  And you don't get anything.  You plant your seeds, you go out and borrow money to get fertilizer, and you just go deeper and deeper into debt." And my mother would say, "Well, Robert that's the only thing that we can do.  What we going to do?" And I hated--growing up as a child--I hated going to the field, plowing a mule, picking cotton, pulling corn, gathering peanuts--out in the hot sun. And my father would always say, "Come on, Bob. You can do it, you can do it." And as a child, I wanted to go to school because I knew education was the way out. And early in the morning sometime, I would get dressed, go and hide under the porch, wait for the school bus to come along, and the moment I'd hear the school bus coming up the hill, I would run out and get on the school bus and go on to school. And, I would slip off to school, rather than go to the field.
Speaker 1: And why do you think you were like that? Why--was there--there was nothing really in your parents or your surroundings that said, "Education was important." But do you think--was there?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother and father knew, we needed to get an education, because my mother used to say things like, "You all need to go to school, get an education so you won't have to work so hard." That was that whole thing, like I'm doing. But at the same time, they knew they needed us to stay out of school to work in the fields. When it was time to pick cotton, you had to pick cotton--or to pull the corn, or to gather the sweet potato. You had to do it. But this uncle of mine, my mother's youngest brother, who had gone to college--he was the only one in her family to go to college, get an education. And he was very encouraging really. And I think that sort of gave me the design to go. But I knew at an early age that it was--I was a very nosy child. My mother said I was nosy. But I don't think it was nosiness so much.  I was just inquisit--I wanted to know. When her aunt would come and visit, or other adults would come and visit, I would eavesdrop to find out what they were talking about. Sometimes I was--as a young child, I would get near the door, in another room and listen, or either get under a chair and listen. And the moment they left the house, out of the door, I say, "What were you all talking about? What was that all about?" And when my mother sometime would walk my grand aunt back home or halfway home, 'cause they would come and visit, and she would ask me to go with her.  And I was very young, but I remember like it was yesterday. And I started referring to my mother as Mrs. Lewis. And they would say to her, they called her 'Baby.'  They'd say, "Baby, what did he call you?" And she said, "Mrs. Lewis." And even until today, I call her Mrs. Lewis from time to time.  And she say, "How old am I going to be before you start calling me 'Mama' or 'Mother?'"
Story_ID: 18490
Speaker 1: Your childhood, would you say that it was a happy childhood? Or was it a hard childhood? Or was it a combination?
Speaker 2: It was a combination.  As a child, I don't think I had a childhood. I don't think I ever--I don't think--I grew up very fast. And when you grow up like we did, you take responsibility. You have to grow up. As a young child, I saw segregation, I saw racial discrimination, and I didn't like it. When we would go downtown to the little town of Troy [Alabama] to the theatre.  I stopped going to the movies--even today because what I saw, I don't like to go to the movies. My wife and son try to convince me from time to time, to go and see this with them, and I don't like going because of what I saw. You pay your money.  Then you have to go upstairs to what we called the 'Buzzard Roost.' And all of the young white children went downstairs to the movie. And when you'd go downtown to the little town of Troy, you'd go to the drugstore or go to the dime store.  I saw the signs that said, "White," "White men," "White women," at the restroom, over the water fountain, "White," "Colored." You go to the little bus station, "White Waiting," "Colored Waiting." I didn't like it. I resented it. And I asked a lot of questions about it.  And my mother would say, "That's the way it is, that's the way it is." And then, I heard of Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.].  And I heard of Rosa Parks, in 1955 when I was fifteen years old, in the tenth grade. I had these unbelievable teachers--wonderful teachers. And there was one woman--her name was Cora Harvey from Montgomery [Alabama].  She was the librarian. And she would tell us to read, read--everything. So she kept up with the Montgomery Bus Boycott, and she was trying in her own way to tell us to read about what was happening in Montgomery. And I read the newspaper, 'Jet' [magazine], 'Ebony' [magazine] we got in the library. My grandfather, who lived about a mile from us, had a subscription to the 'Montgomery Advertiser' [newspaper].  That's like the state leading newspaper. We were so poor, we couldn't afford a newspaper, couldn't afford a subscription. So after my grandfather finish with his newspaper every day, we would get his newspaper and we would read it. And I read it. I listened to the radio. But we also knew that the newspaper was very functional also. We would get water out of our well, and you'd put it in an aluminum bucket. You had a dipper, common dipper for everybody to drink water out of. And you put this bucket with this water on--in it--on a table, wooden table.  But you would leave--use the newspaper as a cover because the cold water will make the container sweat and you needed to protect the table. So we used the newspaper not for just reading, but also as a cover for this table, and also to put in the little chicken box and what we called the little bitties. In 1956, when I was sixteen years old, a group of my first cousins, sisters and brothers went down to the public library in Troy, Alabama trying to get some books--check some books out. We tried to get a library card. We were told by the librarian that the library was for whites only and not for coloreds. But this is a library that was supported by the taxpayers. My father owned 110 acres of land--didn't pay that much property taxes but paid some. So we were paying for this library, but we couldn't use it. I went back to the Pike County Public Library--not the same building--but I went back on July 5, 1998 for a book signing. And hundreds of black and whites citizens showed up. Including the wife of the son of the man--land that we lived on. The Copeland family showed up. And they gave me a library card then.
Speaker 1: Now, you know, I have a question. I never asked this, but do you know the origin of the white and colored only signs? I mean, did they--do you think they started this thing during Reconstruction? Or do you think they listed way back when even?
Speaker 2: I don't know. I, I really--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) That struck me as--.
Speaker 2: Yeah. But it's the period of I guess Jim Crow-ism. But I would think, I would think--I don't know and it's speculation on my part--that it probably came about during Reconstruction. Because why, during the days of slavery, you wouldn't, you wouldn't--there wouldn't be, I guess a reason for it. And during that period, I think that came about in places of public accommodation--bus stations and train stations, stores, where you had restrooms and restaurants. Because in many parts of the South, people could come into a place and they could get takeout. There was a place for coloreds to stand. Coloreds standing, even at train stations and bus stations, you had places where coloreds could stand to get a taxicab or to get a car.
Speaker 1: And the same people would service you? That's what--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Yes.
Speaker 1: It's just that you had to stand in different places--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) In different lines.
Speaker 1: Same people. Okay.
Speaker 2: But even in Alabama, when I was growing up to get your driving license, or to go and buy an alcohol beverage 'cause it was state owned stores.  There was a colored line and a white line.
Story_ID: 18491
Speaker 1: This uncle that you had, he saw that you were different.  And he wanted to sort of nurture you, right?
Speaker 2: He was very encouraging.  This uncle was--his name was Otis. Otis Carter. He had a twin brother. And to this day, I don't know what his letters stand for.  He's still alive. His name is O. C. He lives in Buffalo [New York].  They would come--their mother, my grandmother who I never saw, she died before I was born.  My mother's [Wille Mae Lewis's] mother was named Della.  And so when their mother died, my mother became not just their sister, but almost a surrogate mother for them 'cause they were much younger.  And they would bring their clothing to her to wash.  And they lived with us when we lived on the--on the plantation. They--one of 'em would sleep in the back room.  They would go off.  One went off to school to finish high school in Montgomery [Alabama] and one went to Detroit [Michigan].  But they would come there all the time, and bring  their dirty clothes for my mother to wash, to iron.  We didn't have a washing machine.  We didn't have electricity.  So she had to wash 'em on her hand. We didn't have a washing machine, anything like that.  And then she would heat the iron in the fireplace and iron their shirts.  And one uncle loved to wear white shirts. And my mother had to starch these shirts and iron 'em.  And they would thank her, and she felt like you know, this is the right thing to do to help her two younger brothers out.  So I think this one uncle wanted to try to mend, and they all did really.  So in 1951, when I was eleven years old, one of my uncles invited this uncle to travel back to Buffalo with him, his wife and children.  And we went to Buffalo that summer.  I had never been out of the South before.  And Buffalo was a different place.  It was a different place.  I saw black people and white people working together, living together same neighborhood, shopping.  And what was so fascinating that summer--they would go to a market. And you'd see a chicken in a little box.  And they would take this chicken and tell the man they wanted this chicken, and they would say, "we'll come back and pick up the chicken later."  They'd kill the chicken, dress the chicken and they come back and pick it up.  And I'd never seen anything like that.  We went to a department store, I remember.  And I went up--I saw an escalator and an elevator for the first time.  And I came back home with this uncle, that summer.  I was so happy to be back home.  I cried.  I was--I was just--I was just happy to be back in rural Alabama, back home.  But Buffalo opened up my eyes, really.  So after I finished high school, this uncle gave me a footlocker.  And I said, "Today, I'll put everything that I own in this footlocker."  It was a huge trunk with drawers in it.  I still have it.  It's down at my mother's house.  That--I put my few books, my clothing, shirts that my mother had folded and ironed, my underwear--everything in this footlocker in September 1957.  It had the hanging part that you hang your pants and suits on--I had one suit.  And it had a curtain on it.  Then you could bring it back together and fold it.  So I said, "Today I'll put everything that I own, except those chickens, in that footlocker," and went off to Nashville [Tennessee] to school.
Story_ID: 18492
Speaker 1: I tried to enter Troy State College [Troy, Alabama].  It was an all white school ten miles from my home.  At that time it was called Troy State. Today it's known as Troy State University.  I submitted my application, my high school transcript--I never heard a word from the school.  I didn't tell my mother, my father, my sisters or brothers, anybody.  I just did it.  I never heard a word.  Not one word from the school.  But I wrote a letter to Dr. King and told him of my desire to attend Troy State. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote me back, sent me a round trip Greyhound Bus ticket and invited me to come to Montgomery [Alabama] to visit with him.  So I didn't go.  I went on off to Nashville [Tennessee].  And the reason I--the way I got to Nashville, my mother [Willie Mae Lewis] was working not only on the farm, but she was working at a Baptist orphan home owned by the white southern Baptists in downtown Troy.  Beautiful place.  She was working in their laundry room there.  And somehow, she came across a state Baptist newspaper that talked about this school for Negroes in Nashville.  It was a little college called the American Baptist Theological Seminary--they call it the College of the Bible [sic, American Baptist College] today--where black kids could go to school.  It was jointly owned by the Southern Baptists, which was at that time all white and the National Baptists headed by J. H. Jackson, which was black.  And said that, "You didn't have to pay any tuition.  Just pay your room and board." They had a work program that you could work your way--and so I applied to go there.  And my first job to work my way through school, that would pay my room and board, was to work in the kitchen.  And so I arrived there.  Students met me, drove me to my dorm.  And I checked in and started work in the next two or three days.  And this--I was seventeen years old, weighed about 135 pounds.  And I hated washing these pots and pans, especially on the day that we served liver, because it was so--the bottom of the pan was so dirty.  You fill it with water and it was so heavy for me to pick up.  We had these big old boilers--it was almost as tall as I was--and you had to lift all this water and pour it out. But anyway I did it for two years and waitin' on the line.
Story_ID: 18493
Speaker 1: And I started going over to Fisk--Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee] there.  Different speakers would come in to speak like Daisy Bates from Little Rock [Arkansas], who was heading the drive to desegregate Central High [School] in the 'Little Rock Nine.'  Thurgood Marshall would come.  Roy Wilkins.  [Dr.] Martin Luther King, Jr. would come and speak at a mass meeting, at a rally at Fisk. And one day I was walking across the campus at Fisk with two or three students from American Baptist and W. E. B. DuBois walked across the campus.  And I--And I walked up to him and shook his hand.  And all of these things just sort of came together.  Martin Luther King Jr. wrote me again.  And somehow he discovered from a young minister in Nashville that I was in Nashville at American Baptist [Theological Seminary, Nashville, Tennessee].  And suggested if I was home from spring break to come and see him.  So in March of 1958, by this time, I'm eighteen years old.  On a Saturday morning, my father [Eddie Lewis] drove me to the Greyhound Bus station. I boarded a bus, traveled the fifty miles from Troy [Alabama] to Montgomery [Alabama].  I arrive in Montgomery.  I'd never seen a lawyer before, black or white.  A young black lawyer by the name of Fred Grey, who is now living in Tuskegee [Alabama]--who was the lawyer for Rosa Parks and Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] in the [Civil Rights] Movement--met me and drove me to the First Baptist Church in downtown Montgomery pastored by Reverend Ralph Abernathy.  He ushered me into the office of the church, and I walked into the pastor's study.  I saw Dr. King standing behind a desk.  I was so scared.  I was so frightened.  I didn't know what I was gonna say to Martin Luther King, Jr.  'Cause this man had emerged for me as one bigger than life.  He was my hero. And he said--when I walked through the door, he said, "Are you the boy from Troy [Alabama]?  Are you John Lewis?"  I said, "Dr. King, I am John Robert Lewis."  I gave him my whole name.  I didn't want there to be any mistake that I was the right person.  That was the beginning of my relationship with Martin Luther King Jr.  And really my beginning involvement in the Civil Rights Movement.
Speaker 2: So you know but what is interesting about this story is that he was very responsive to, to people and sort of nurtured--it seems as if nurturing to young people too.  I mean although--you know you hear also the story between Southern Christian Leadership Conference [SCLC] and SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] you know later. But--was he that--I mean 'cause this is someone who you had written to and he wrote back to.
Speaker 1: In a sense I guess I was surprised to get a response, but I was so pleased.  Later he told me he was moved by the fact that someone from rural Alabama--near Troy--he called where I grew up 'Four Corners Alabama.'  Four corners.  Because he asked me he said, "Where is it on the map?"  I said, "It's not on the map Dr. King."  I said, "It's a stop. It's near Carter's Quarters."  And so he became very encouraging for me.  He was very responsive.  And he told me in so many words, "If you want to do this, we'll see you through.  But you've got to--you must be willing to do it.  You must have the support of your parents. Are they willing to do it."  I said, "Well I'll go back and I will talk with them."  He said, "You're only eighteen years old. You cannot file a suit in Alabama without the consent of your parents--some adult.  And we will be willing to hire Fred Grey and the NAACP [National Association of Colored People] Legal Defense Fund and Thurgood Marshall to sue the state of Alabama, the Board of Education."  He said, "But--" He warned me.  He said "Your parents' home could get bombed or burned.  They may lose their land.  Are you willing to do it?"  So I went back and had a discussion with my folks.  And my mother said, "It's too much.  It's just too much."  So I continued to study in Nashville. And when I look back on it, it was the best thing for me.  'Cause it was there that I came under the influence of [Rev.] Jim [James] Lawson. And every Tuesday night for a whole school year, a group of us--black and white college students--would go to a little Methodist Church near Fisk University where we studied the great religions of the world.  We studied [Henry David] Thoreau and civil disobedience.  We studied what [Mohandas] Gandhi attempted to do in South Africa, what he accomplished in India.  We studied Dr. King and the Montgomery [Alabama] Movement.  It was there that I immersed myself in the philosophy of non-violence.

Speaker 1: Who were these white students you know originally?  I mean who were they?  We know that, you know, a lot of the black colleges got started you know by whites. More missionary types.  You know.  We know that there were the [Julius] Rosenwalds [chairman of Sears Roebuck department store] that, you know, sort of help establish a lot of--but who were these, you know, white students? Because they were different from the white students that started coming later from the North.  Right?
Speaker 2: They were very much so.  There were some southern white students that came under the influence of the Movement under the influence--that had heard Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] speak.  And there was a pocket of whites in different states in the South that had been attending meetings sponsored by the Southern Regional Council.  And in most of the states you had what you called a state council on human relations. And there were young people attending some of these sort of church-related schools. There was a little school in Nashville called Scarritt College [for Christian Workers]. It was a Methodist-supported school.  And there were some very liberal professors there, and there was just pockets of white students that felt that segregation and racial discrimination was not in keeping with their religious belief and faith, and they wanted to be part of an effort.  And then you had at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee]--in places like Tougaloo [College, Tougaloo, Mississippi] and Talladega [College, Talladega, Alabama] and Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], and Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] where you had exchange students--white students from other parts of the country from schools in Minnesota and Wisconsin and California.  They were from Colby College in [Waterville] Maine.  And so these young people also started attending the workshop.  But at Vanderbilt [University, Nashville, Tennessee] and Peabody [College, part of Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee] there were kids at med[ical] school and in the divinity school and law school that started attending some of these workshops.  Those were very few, but it was a pocket to create sort of an interracial movement.

Speaker 1: Jim Lawson--one of the extraordinary human beings.  Unbelievable.  He had been part of something called the Methodist Student Movement.  He had objected, I guess to the Korean War.  He refused to be drafted.  He became a CO [conscientious objector].  He went to prison.  He went to India and studied there for a while.  And then he became part of an organization called the Fellowship of Reconciliation, FOR.  It was teaching the philosophy and the discipline of nonviolence.  He enrolled at Vanderbilt [University, Nashville, Tennessee].  I think he was the second black student to become a member of the Vanderbilt Divinity School student body. And while he was there, he started conducting these workshops.  One Sunday night, I went to a meeting at a church called First [Colored] Baptist Church [on] Eighth Avenue [North].  It's a black church that grew out of a white church right after slavery in downtown. This church was less than a block from the state capital.  A beautiful old church.  It was pastored by one of the most gifted speakers I think I ever heard.  This young man was named [Rev.] Kelly Miller Smith.  He was born in Mound Bayou, Mississippi, attended Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia] undergrad, and Howard [University] Divinity School [Washington, D.C.].  This man was so gifted with words, his sermon was only about ten minutes. But when you listened to him speak, you knew.  He was just wonderful.  And many of the faculty members at Fisk [University, Nashvillle, Tennessee], Tennessee State [University, Nashville, Tennessee], Meharry Medical [College, Nashville, Tennessee] school, they attended his church.  He was where the doctors, the lawyers, the ministers. But there were some regular people.  The bankers and the real estate, the black business people.  They attended this church.  So I started going there as a poor boy from Alabama.  You heard some of the most beautiful, wonderful music.  The director of the choir--they would always do an anthem before he would speak.  But before they would do some major hymn.  They would also do a Negro spiritual.  And the director was a woman, a beautiful black woman by the name of Helen Wert.  She was a sister of John Wert who was director of the Fisk Jubilee Singers.  And they would--you couldn't leave there.  You couldn't be there without being inspired. So I went there one Sunday night after hearing an announcement made that Jim Lawson would be there conducting the nonviolent workshop for the social action committee of the church.  And I was deeply moved by what he had to say.  And at this meeting, Jim Lawson announced that he was gonna start conducting nonviolent workshop on the Fisk University campus.  And this guy just led us through the history of nonviolence.  He talked about the roads to the disobedient.  Talked about all the other great religions of the world.  This element of justice. This element of love.  And we weren't talking about segregation and racial discrimination.  He was preparing us for it.  And then in the fall of 1959, November, December '59 [1959], he had a group of us--black and white college students and some international students.  Students from Africa, India, Central, South America to participate in what we called a test sit-in at two of the large department stores in Nashville.  So he had us to dress up, put on our coats and tie.  Young ladies put on their stockings and heels.  And we go downtown--I'd never done anything like this before except going to the library.  And we take our books and we go to two or three different restaurants and a lunch counter in a department store called Harvey's Department Store.  Harvey's to Nashville would be what Macy's is to any major city.  We take the seats, and the waitress said, "We don't serve you.  We cannot serve you."  She refused to serve the white students because they were with us, and refused to serve us because we were black.  So we asked to speak to the manager.  The manger came out.  He say, "It is our policy not to serve colored people."  And he told the whites, "We cannot--you cannot be served if you're with them."  So we got up and left.  Came back in December and went to another store called Cain-Sloan's.  A similar thing happened.  And we continued our nonviolent workshops.  And when the sit-in started in Greensboro, North Carolina on February the 1st, we received a call from a local minister.  I can't think of his name right now, as well as I know him.  He later became a member of the D.C. city council--Doug-somebody.  As well as I know him--I saw him a few days ago.  But he called--he was a friend of Jim Lawson.  He called and said to Jim, he said, "What can the students of Nashville do to be supportive of the students in North Carolina in the sit-in [at Woolworth's lunch counter in Greensboro]?"  And Jim said, "We're planning to start sitting-in in the next day or so on a regular basis." And then we had mass meet--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Was it Reverend [Kelly Miller] Smith?
Speaker 1: Not Reverend Smith.  So we had a mass meeting in the chemistry hall auditorium on the Fisk University campus.  More than 500 students showed up.  We conducted a nonviolent workshop with these students. And the next day we were downtown sitting in.  And we occupied every lunch counter, every restaurant at the variety stores like Woolworth, Kresge's, McClellan, Walgreen's drug store.  And we were just sitting there in an orderly, peaceful nonviolent fashion. And then the sit-in just started spreading all across the South.  Different cities.  And then we would go and sit-in every single Tuesday and Thursday and Saturday. 'Cause the T days we considered like class days--and Saturday.  And we would be sitting there in an orderly, peaceful, nonviolent fashion.  No one saying a word doing our homework.  And some one would come up and put a lighted cigarette out in our hair or down our backs, Poured hot water on us, hot coffee, hot chocolate, pull us off the lunch counter stool, spit on us, start beating us and we would sit there.  And that Friday, we got word that if we go and sit in on that Saturday--which would have been February the 27, 1960--that the merchants would allow people to beat us up and they were gonna try to stop the movement.  And then the city was gonna order the police to place us under arrest--because no one had been arrested so far.  By this time I was working as a janitor in the--at the school in the administration building.  And it was my responsibility, along with another young man named Bernard Lafayette, to draw up the do's and don'ts of the sit-in movement.  And I drew up the do's and don'ts, and they were very simple.  They were patterned behind the Montgomery Bus Boycott do's and don'ts.  And they said something like, "Do's and don't.  Sit up straight.  Don't talk back.  Don't laugh out.  Obey your leader, or either we, said obey your spokesperson."  'Cause each group had like a leader or spokesperson.  "Remember the teaching of [Mohandas] Gandhi, [Henry David] Thoreau, Jesus, [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.]," and said, "May God bless you."  We drew those up.  We didn't have any paper to copy them.  But since I had the keys to the office supply, I liberated a ream of paper, and we took that ream of paper and we cut it, and rather than halfing 500 sheets, we got a thousand sheets.  And we put these do's and don'ts.  We got a old mimeograph machine and we ran them. The next day, more than 500 students showed up at First Baptist Church to be transported downtown to the sit-in.  And we were sitting in.  And a group of people came and started just beating us, beating us.  But every single student had a copy of the do's and don'ts on them.  And they would beat us and then the police officer would come in and arrest us.  And they'd arrest one group, and another group would come in and occupy those seats.  That day, ninety-eight of us got arrested and went to jail.  That became the first mass arrest in the sit-in movement. And every student had a copy of the do's and don'ts.  And in Nashville, Tennessee the local paper printed the do's and don'ts--so it got out to the larger community.  And later [U.S.] Senator Jacob Javits of New York did a little book and he printed those do's and don'ts in his little book.
Story_ID: 18496
Speaker 1: As I was reading, you know, your book and I was you know, thinking about how brilliant, really, the approach taken, you know, with the nonviolence approach, you know, and following--how brilliant that was and probably also Nashville [Tennessee] was--not that that would be the only place but a good place to start given you know Birmingham [Alabama], and you know, the other places Mississippi.  You know, all the other places in the South.
Speaker 2: It was sort of up south.  Sort of more--.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) You were up south.  Okay.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) A more moderate city.
Speaker 1: Right, right. So it was an easier city to really begin in.  And I'm wondering--tell me when you first heard Jim Lawson talk and--I mean it wasn't your first approach.  Because Martin Luther King [Jr.] was professing nonviolence too.  But when you first heard him talk, can you tell me what is a you know young person who is studying to be a theologian.  You know, what attracted you to this person?
Speaker 2: Well when I first heard Jim Lawson speak about nonviolence, about passive resistance, about love in action, he touched me.  I said, "This is, this is it, this is it." He was the first person I heard talk about the open society.  The good society.  The beloved community.  A community at peace with itself.  This was in keeping with what I believed.  You know, going to seminary and he--and growing up in a church, hearing ministers preach.  They were always talking about over yonder--by and by.  And Jim Lawson,  to me, was preaching the here and now.  It was sort of the social gospel.  It was what [Dr.] Martin Luther King, Jr., you know--that we cannot only be concerned about the by and by, the hereafter.  Those pearly gates and streets flowing with milk and honey.  We have to be concerned about the streets in Nashville, in the doors of Woolworth and Kresge's and McClellan's and Walgreen's.  So that really was good news to me.  And somehow I was ready.  I was ready to receive this message, and ready to act accordingly.  'Cause I had seen segregation.  I had seen racial discrimination.  I tasted the bitter fruits of racism, and I didn't like it, I didn't like it. And so this guy was saying, in so many words through his message and his teaching, "You can do something about it in a loving, nonviolent way."  He convinced me more than anyone that you had to accept nonviolence not simply as a technique, not simply as a tactic but as a way of life, as a way of living.  'Cause Jim Lawson would use this example.  He would say, "If you accept nonviolence as a technique, as a tactic, it's like a faucet.  You can turn it on or you can turn it off.  You have to decide well one day I'm gonna love Sue.  Then the next day I'm gonna hate Mary.  And one day I'm gonna love Joe and then the next day I'm gonna hate Bob."  He said, "Just love everybody.  Love is a better way.  It's a more excellent way."  And then he said, "Means and ends are inseparable."  I had been studying philosophy in seminary and hearing my professors talk about means and ends being inseparable, but this guy made it so real. So plain! That you cannot hate--you cannot hate.  You cannot use violence if you're gonna bring about a loving community--a community at peace with itself.  And then in the religious sense, you say that in the heart and soul of every human being, there is the spark of the divine.  And so if you believe that in every human being there is a spark--it may be small in some people, and it may be much larger in some others.  But if you conceive the idea there is a spark of the divine in every human being, than we don't have a right to abuse or to destroy that spark of the divine.  And then he went on to make the point that I tried to make in my book.  That people--we don't come into this world born hating someone because of the color of their skin, because of their race.  It was something that we get from our environment, it is something that we're taught.  And he used the example by saying, look at a man like George Wallace, he was the governor of Alabama.  Or someone like Bull O'Connor the police commissioner in Birmingham.  Or the people that would have beat us or the people that kicked--they were somebody's children.  Somebody's little baby and something happened.  So he made it very plain. He made it real for me.  And he came across very sincere. He was not a show horse, he was a workhorse.  And--he had--he could have emerged as the leader of the [Civil Rights] Movement. But that was not the road he wanted to play. He wanted to help create a cadre of young people, an army of believers, and that's what he did.
Story_ID: 18497
Speaker 1: Many of the women never get the credit that they should have received.  'Cause the male--the [Civil Rights] Movement was male chauvinism.  It was the height of it--maybe at its worst or at its best--I don't know which way to put it. Because it was dominated by Baptist--church--well not just Baptist.  But black church people.  And Ella Baker had her own problem with Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] and others. And I think that's one reason Jim Lawson said--you couldn't just fight for equality.  But you need equality within the Movement itself. We fought for equality, but in the movement, you had the women getting out there doing all of the nitty-gritty work. Picketing, making the signs, sitting in, getting beaten, going to jail.  But very few of them were allowed to play major leadership roles. But there were people like a Diane Nash, Gloria Richardson in Cambridge [Maryland], Fannie Lou Hamer , Ella Baker, Daisy Bates. The other lady I was thinking about, Ruby Doris Smith, she was from Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia].
Story_ID: 18498
Speaker 1: Let's talk about just some of the key periods of the [Civil Rights] Movement.  You know, I'll let you just sort of lead it.  But, you know, 'cause I need to get to your congressional career. But can you talk about some of the you know, the key moments for you. I know you talk about your friendship with, you know, Jim Bevel.  You know. But one question I had--what were your parents thinking during this time?
Speaker 2: Well my--well, I never told my mother [Willie Mae Lewis].  I never told my father [Eddie Lewis]. I never talked to my sisters and brothers about the fight or that I was even attending these nonviolent workshops. Because I knew they would be--they would live in constant fear. So I thought it was best not to tell them. I just did it.
Speaker 1: So they just think at this point you're studying to be a minister.
Speaker 2: They think I'm studying to be a minister, that I'm going to church every Sunday and I'm going to Sunday school.  I'm going to church on a Sunday night.  I'm attending the what do you call it?  The vesper service during the week and just being a good student.  Trying to get an education.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) (laughs) And you're there like in sit-ins and studying.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) In the sit-ins.
Speaker 1: But that's--you know, that's what I'm saying.  Jim Lawson--it's--I think there--that approach was almost--it was brilliant in many ways.  And it was--that approach ultimately worked on South Africa to--I don't know.  They were not nonviolent in South Africa.
Speaker 2: But in the early, early stages under [Chief] Albert Lutuli , the early stages of the NAC [sic. ANC, African National Congress], they were committed to the philosophy and the discipline of nonviolence.  Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was deeply moved by what Albert Lutuli and those folks tried to do initially.  And when he received the Nobel Peace Prize he paid homage to the South Africa struggle and to Albert Lutuli.  But later on they made a decision to go with arms struggle.  But the early people was committed to nonviolence.  I think Jim Lawson convinced us.  It was not just a matter of convincing us that nonviolence was a better way.  But it was the right way if you wanted to redeem the soul of America and the soul of the South.  And then it was the practical thing to do. 'Cause if we had tried to engage in violence, we would have been slaughtered. We would have been slaughtered. We would have been mowed down in many parts of the South.  Especially in places like Alabama and Mississippi.  And I thought at times we were going to die during that period.  When my mother heard that I had been arrested--the school official had to call and say, "You know your son is in jail.  He's been arrested for sitting in."  My mother wrote me a letter.  And my mother had beautiful handwriting.  And she wrote me--she just wrote me this nice letter like, "Dear Robert, What are you doing?  So I hope when you receive this letter that you're doing fine.  But you need to get out of that mess."  That's what she called it.  "You're gonna get yourself hurt.  Do you wanna get yourself killed?"  When I was growing up as a young child, even to this day I'd always hear my mother say--when I talk to her--If I called her today and talk to her, her last words are gonna be something like, "Be particular."  I don't know where she got that phrase from.  But she told me in that letter to "Be particular."  From as far back as I can remember my mother, almost constantly she would say, "Be particular."  And I think what she was saying be careful. Be mindful.  Be watchful of your surrounding.  'Cause she would tell me when I would go home to Alabama and get on a bus to go back to Nashville [Tennessee] to school.  She'd say, "Get home, you get to your dorm, to your room, you look in the closet.  You look under the bed."  She was very concerned that something was gonna happen to me.  And even today if she hear that I'm going some place, if I'm traveling to Selma [Alabama], to Birmingham [Alabama] into some part of Mississippi.  She say, "Why you going there?  You be careful.  You be particular."  So I wrote her a letter back and told her in so many words that I had acted according to my conscience.  I sort of tried to take off from Martin Luther [16th century religious reformer] and said, "I've acted according to my conscience and it's the only thing that I can do.  Segregation is wrong, and somebody got to do something about it.  I can't get out of this mess.  I cannot get out of this movement.  I'm in it now and I cannot get out." So for a period there, for about a year and a half or two years, there was sort of a distance.  And it was a pretty deep distance between my folks because of my involvement in the Movement.
Speaker 1: So your family had--thought you had taken it too far?
Speaker 2: Oh they thought that I had lost my mind.  They thought I was going crazy. They--he's really--my father didn't talk about it that much.  But my mother, she worried a great deal.  And later when the Freedom Rides occurred, that's when they knew something was really, really wrong. I had been beaten on the Freedom Ride.
Story_ID: 18499
Speaker 1: I came to Washington D.C. the first time on May 20--on May 1st, 1961, forty years ago, to respond to an invitation to go on the Freedom Rides.  With thirteen of us--seven whites and six blacks.  We met here in Washington to go through a period of orientation, a period of training.  People told us, "This is gonna be a very dangerous trip."  We were to test a decision of the [U.S.] Supreme Court, and we need to be prepared for it.  We could be beaten.  We may be ambushed.  We could be killed. It was a wonderful group of people to study in--to be trained with.  I think we met at a place here called the Fellowship House.  I do recall the night of May third, 1961.  We went down to a little place--a Chinese restaurant, someplace in downtown Washington.  I'd never had Chinese food before.  It was a wonderful meal.  It was an unbelievable meal.  It was at--we had two or three round tables.  They had a lazy Susan and it was in these covered dishes.  And you passed, turned the thing around.  And they had  chicken fried rice, sweet and sour, and as I can recall different vegetables.  And someone said that night--now I'd never had Chinese food before.  It was good.  Because growing up in rural Alabama there was no Chinese, so there were no Chinese restaurant.  And so to me it was like one of the highlight of being in Washington.  And someone said that night, "You should eat well.  Because this may be like the last supper."  Little did we know.  We boarded the bus the next day May fourth, 1961 to travel from Washington through Virginia, without many problem, into North Carolina.  Arrived in North Carolina--a young black rider, young man named Joseph Perkins tried to enter a so-called white waiting room at the Greyhound bus station.  He went in, went to the white barbershop in the waiting room. He got up in the shoe stand to try to get a shoeshine--'cause we were testing everything.  He was arrested, taken to jail.  The next day, next morning the judge dropped the charges against him.  We traveled on to Rock Hill, [South] Carolina near Charlotte [North Carolina].  My seatmate was a very distinguished white gentleman named Albert Bigelow--a few years older.  He was from Cos Cob, Connecticut.  The two of us tried to enter a so-called white waiting room.  The waiting room marked "white waiting."  We entered the door, and the moment we walked through the door, a group of white young men jumped us.  They started beating us.  And Albert was such a big guy--he literally probably could have picked these guys up and just turned them around on his shoulder.  But he believed in nonviolence as a way of life, as a way of living.  And the two of us was knocked down and left lying there bloody in a pool of blood.  The local police officials showed up and asked did we want to press charges  And we said, "No."
Story_ID: 18500
Speaker 1: I was graduating from American Baptist [Theological Seminary, Nashville, Tennessee] that month, later that month [May 1961].  I had applied to go abroad with American Friends Service Committee to India or to Tanzania.  And they had requested that I come to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] to take my physical and for my last interview.  And so the next day, I got on a flight and flew from Charlotte [North Carolina] to Philadelphia on an Eastern [Airlines] flight.  And I think, and I'm not positive, but I think it was my first airline flight.  It was those old electric Eastern flights.  And when they take off the smoke and fire come out of the thing. Somewhere it's a flame.  And I didn't know whether the plane was on fire or what was happening.  But anyway, we landed in Philadelphia, and they picked me up.  The next day I had my physical and my final interview, and had been accepted to go.  I was supposed to rejoin the Freedom Rides in Montgomery [Alabama].  The people traveling on the Greyhound bus that I was on made it through Georgia without any problem.  They get outside of Atlanta [Georgia], between Atlanta and Birmingham [Alabama] near a little city called Anniston, Alabama.  They stop at the Greyhound bus station.  The tires are deflated and the bus had to stop.  And the [Ku Klux] Klan attacked the bus.  Set the bus on fire, firebombed the bus and the people were beaten.  And later people come and rescued them and take them to Birmingham.  The people on the Trailway bus are beaten at the Greyhound bus station in Birmingham.  There was one young man named Jim Peck who was so badly beaten--he was a young white man--it took more than fifty stitches to sew up his skull.  So Bobby [Robert F.] Kennedy, the [U.S.] Attorney General, called for a cooling off period--that the rides should be suspended.  CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] was headed at that time by James Forman.  They made a decision to suspend the ride, and those people that were able flew on to New Orleans [Louisiana].  I went back to Nashville [Tennessee] rather than to Montgomery.  And met with Diane Nash, James Bevel, Bernard Lafayette, Jim Lawson, C.T. Vivian, [Rev.] Kelly Miller Smith and others at Kelly Miller Smith's church, the First [Colored] Baptist Church [Nashville, Tennessee] on a Sunday night.  And we debated that Sunday night whether we should pick up the ride or whether they should start over.  And we argued and argued.  Now, as students we didn't have any money.  The adults kept the money.  They were the treasurers, but we had helped raise a lot of money for the [Civil Rights] Movement.  We needed nine hundred dollars.  And we begged.  We pleaded, "Make nine hundred dollars available for us, and we would take ten people, and we would have enough money for tickets for food to continue the ride."  James Forman, Bobby Kennedy, and others, and the people of Nashville begged us not to continue the ride.  They said it was suicide.  They said, "We come there, we probably get killed.  Don't go."  So we made a decision that we had to go.  'Cause we couldn't allow the threat of violence to stop a nonviolent movement.  And we decided to leave the city of Nashville on Wednesday morning, May 17th, at 6:30 a.m. for Birmingham.  It was ten of us.  Since I had been on a ride--on the original ride, they selected me to be the spokesperson for the group.  At that time, I'm twenty-one years old.  (Pause)  At that time I'm twenty-one years old.  I'm in charge of nine young people--two whites, three women, seven guys from Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee], Tennessee State [University, Nashville, Tennessee], American Baptist and Peabody [College, part of Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee]. We get to Birmingham--to the city limit on the bus.  Very quiet--we're on the Greyhound bus with other regular passengers.  The bus is stopped at the city limit.  Bull Connor, the police commissioner board the bus.  And behind the bus driver, there's a young white student named Jim Zwerg.  He was a exchange student at Fisk from the Beloit College in [Beloit] Wisconsin, and a young black student named Paul Brooks from American Baptist.  He asked them to move because they were sitting together--black and white.  They were sitting right behind the bus driver.  They refused to move.  So he took them to jail--placed them under arrest.  Then he asked to see all of our tickets.  And the eight of us remaining, our tickets read from Nashville to Birmingham [Alabama], Birmingham to Montgomery, Montgomery to Jackson [Mississippi], Jackson to New Orleans.  He stayed on the bus, Bull Connor did, and ordered the bus driver to drive the bus to the Greyhound bus station in Birmingham.  He ordered all the other--when we got to the Birmingham station, he ordered all the other regular passengers to get off the bus and forced us to stay on.  He then ordered the police officials to place newspaper and cardboard on all of the windows, the windshield, the back, so photographers, camera people, reporters could not see inside the bus.  The young white lady who was on the trip, her name was Selyn McCollum. Somehow we got word to her to say that she was not with the group in order to be able to get off and communicate back to Diane.  And she tried to get off and say she was not--and [Eugene] 'Bull' Connor said, "You are with the group."  And she was forced to stay on the bus.  We stayed on for almost two hours.  Then he said,  "I'm taking you all in and placing you in protective custody."  And he placed the eight of us in protective custody.  So we went into that jail that Wednesday afternoon.  We stayed in jail Wednesday night, all day Thursday, Thursday night.  We went on a hunger strike.  We refused to eat anything.  Most of us hadn't had anything to eat since Tuesday evening, so we were very hungry.  But we decided that we wouldn't cooperate.  So we stayed in jail. Early Friday morning, about three or four o'clock, Bull Connor came up to our cells and said, "We are taking you back to Nashville, to the college campus." And we really thought--we were naive enough to believe that this man was going to take us back to Nashville. We get to the Alabama/Tennessee state line--Ku Klux Klan territory. Just as dark as a thousand midnight. He said, "I'm going to put you out here. A bus will come along, You make it back to Nashville the best way you can." And we really thought we were going to be ambushed--that we were going to get shot and killed or lynched, or whatever. In the meantime, we didn't know what happened to Selyn, 'cause she was not with us.  We didn't know what happened to the two people who had been arrested. But later we learned they had gone to trial and the jury had dismissed the charges against them.

Speaker 1: During the Freedom Ride, [Eugene] 'Bull' Connor, the police commissioner of the city of Birmingham [Alabama] had taken a group of us from the city jail.  After we had stayed in jail Wednesday, night, all day Thursday, Thursday night, and early Friday morning.  He took us from jail, seven of us.  He took us to the Alabama-Tennessee state line and left us.  He had told us he was taking us back to the college campus [Fisk University] in Nashville [Tennessee].  In the meantime, we didn't know exactly what had happened to two other Freedom Riders who had earlier been arrested for sitting on the front of the bus--a young black man and a young white man.  And a young lady who was in jail also with us, had been taken from jail by her father and taken back to the college campus in Nashville.  So we were just dropped--left--and we didn't know what to do.  And one of the young black men in the group said, "There must be some colored people living someplace near by."  And so we started walking.  We came across some railroad tracks and we saw an old house--a shotgun house, just a shack--and we went and knocked on the door.  And an elderly black man came to the door.  And we said, "We're the Freedom Riders.  Please let us in.  We're in trouble.  Please let us in."  And he closed the door.  We continued to knock.  He came back and his wife came, and she pleaded with her husband to let us in.  And they decided to let us in. And they took the seven of us and placed us in a back room of the house and told us to be quiet.  Now we hadn't had anything to eat since Tuesday.  And this is now early Friday morning. 'Cause in jail we went on a hunger strike.  And so we were very hungry.  So when daylight came and the little stores opened in this little town, the Alabama-Tennessee state line, this elderly man got in his pickup truck--this old broken down truck.  We gave him some money, and he went to several different shops and bought food for us to have something to eat.  He got cold cuts--bologna, cheese, what we called cinnamon rolls, and milk, and soda, and brought it back for us to eat.  The reason he went to several different places, he didn't want to create any amount or degree of suspicion on the part of the local whites.  And we stayed in that house until we could call the young lady back in Nashville who was coordinating the Freedom Rides.  Her name was Diane Nash.  And Diane Nash told us that, "Eleven other packages had been shipped by other means."  That meant that eleven other students--eleven other Freedom Riders had been left by train to come to Birmingham to join the ride to pick up where we had left off.  And she wanted to know whether we wanted her to send a car to pick us up to bring us back to Nashville or take us back to Birmingham.  And we said send a car and we would go back to Birmingham.  So the seven of us waited for a young driver to come--another student.  And this young man was named Leo Lillard, twenty years old.  When I look back on it, he was so daring, so courageous.  Twenty years old to get into a car, to drive all the way from Nashville to the Alabama-Tennessee state line, someplace he had never been, following the direction that we gave him to pick us up to take us back to Birmingham.  The car arrived, we got in the car.  Started toward Birmingham and UPI [United Press International] reported on the radio, they said,  "The United Press International is now reporting that the students are back in Nashville [Tennessee]."  And then down this highway, we were listening to the news.  And they had a bulletin saying the students are now, we understand returning to Birmingham by private car.  That was so frightening, 'cause we thought we were gonna be ambushed or something.  But we did make it back to Birmingham and went to the home of Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth and met the other eleven students.  And from there we went to the Greyhound bus station in downtown Birmingham at five p.m. to board a bus to go from Birmingham to Montgomery [Alabama].
Story_ID: 18503
Speaker 1: And we tried to board this bus [from Birmingham, Alabama to Montgomery, Alabama]. They called the bus from Montgomery.  And the moment that we went out to try to board the bus, this white bus driver made a classic statement.  He said, "I have only one life to give.  And I'm not gonna give it to CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] or the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]."  And he refused to drive the bus. He was afraid to drive because of what had happened earlier with the burning of the bus in Anniston, Alabama and the beating of people on the Trailways bus earlier in Birmingham.  So during that night, we were forced to stay in the Greyhound bus station that evening in the city of Birmingham.  All night, waiting to get a bus to go from Birmingham to Montgomery.  And [U.S. Attorney General] Robert [F.] Kennedy intervened and told the officials at Greyhound that we had a right to travel. And at one time, Robert Kennedy became so desperate he said, "Well do you have any colored bus drivers?"  Greyhound didn't have any black bus drivers in Birmingham.  And then Robert Kennedy was heard to say, "Then let me speak to Mr. Greyhound.  These people have a right to travel."  So before daybreak that Saturday morning, May 20th, 1961, Robert Kennedy negotiated an arrangement that we were able to board a bus to go from Birmingham to Montgomery.  And on the bus, there would be two officials of Greyhound riding, sitting on the front seat on the righthand side.  And there would be a private plane flying over the bus.  And every fifteen miles there would be a state patrol car to protect us as we traveled from Birmingham to Montgomery.  So that Saturday morning about 8:30 a.m., we left the Greyhound bus station in Birmingham.  I was sitting right behind the bus driver with a young white student who was my seatmate. And most of the young people on the bus who had stayed up most of the night took a nap.  They literally went to sleep.  Other passengers was on the bus.  And as we traveled down that highway toward Montgomery, you would see the patrol car.  And every now and then you would see the plane.  And the moment that we arrived at the Greyhound bus station in Montgomery, the plane disappeared, you didn't see a patrol car.  We started down the steps off the bus and a mob came out of nowhere.  Just hundreds of people.  And they turned to the press and started beating the members of the press.  And if you had a pencil and a pad, if you had a camera, you were in real trouble.  They literally took the pads and pencils from the press.  Took the cameras from them and then they took some of the television people or network people who had these big cameras on their shoulders and just smashed them, knocking them down and you saw blood coming every place.  Just all over the place.  And then they turned on us and started beating us.  I was hit in the head by a man with a wooden crate and knocked down and left unconscious, and bloody.  That was an awful and bloody morning there in the City of Montgomery.  We were scattered in different parts of the city.  People came down to try to rescue us.  And someone came and got me and took me to a local black physician's office.  And others were transferred to the local hospital.  And the Catholic hospital for blacks was St. Jude in Montgomery that took a lot of the people in.
Story_ID: 18504
Speaker 1: The next day, at least that evening, we were able to get together in one particular spot.  Diane Nash, we would call her in Nashville [Tennessee] and tell her where we were.  And she was suggesting that we meet at a particular place, and that evening we did meet at a little church in Montgomery and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Reverend Ralph Abernathy had been on a speaking tour in Chicago [Illinois].  And they flew from Chicago to Atlanta [Georgia], Atlanta to Montgomery and they came to that meeting late that Saturday night.  And during that meeting, we made plans for a mass rally at the First Baptist Church on Ripley Street in downtown Montgomery, pastored by Reverend Ralph Abernathy.  This is one of the churches that had been bombed during the Montgomery Bus Boycott.  So that Sunday evening, we gathered at the church.  And all of the Freedom Riders were placed in the choir stand in order for us to look like members of the choir.  There was an official of the [U.S.] Department of Justice a young man by the name of John Doar who didn't want us to talk with the officials of Alabama, didn't want us to be interviewed by the state investigators or any of the officials.  He wanted us to be interviewed by the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] and the Department of Justice attorney.  So we were disguised as members of the choir.  And so we took our places.  I had a bandage on my head that looked like a Red Cross symbol, and so they placed a cap on my head.  It was very strange to me when I think about it and look back on it, sitting up in this Baptist church with a cap on my head in the choir.  But at night people gathered--hundreds of people.  We filled the church before the meeting even started.  And while people continued to gather, a angry mob marched on the church and started burning the cars of people.  Started throwing stink bombs into the church.  And they started knocking on the windows of First Baptist Church.  Dr. Martin Luther King [Jr.] went into the basement of the church and made a telephone call to Robert Kennedy and told him about what was happening there.  And the [U.S.] President [John F. Kennedy] and the attorney general dispatched federal marshals--U.S. marshals to Montgomery.  And they started burning the cars of the U.S. marshals and started throwing stones and rocks at them.  And Robert Kennedy made contact again with his brother, the president and said, "The situation is so dangerous in Montgomery.  You got to do more."  So the city of Montgomery was put under martial law.  And the Alabama National Guard were federalized to protect us while we were in that church.  We were forced to stay in the church all night that night.  Not just the Freedom Riders, but more than a thousand others.  We couldn't leave the church. The general of the Alabama National Guard came in, took over the meeting and said "No one can leave."  That it was a very dangerous situation, someone could be hurt or killed.  And about three or four o'clock [a.m.] that Monday morning, they placed us all in jeeps and we left in a long motorcade.  And they took all of the Freedom Riders, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Reverend Abernathy and other leaders of the movement to the home of a black businessperson, a man by the name of Richard Harris who was a leading businessperson in Montgomery who owned a pharmacist.  And that's where we stayed--all of us.  And the different church people prepared food for all of the Freedom Riders and for Dr. King and Reverend Abernathy and all of us who stayed at his home for several days until we made an announcement--I believe that Wednesday--that the Freedom Riders would continue to travel from Alabama to Mississippi.  Later that week, we left.  Other people came in from all across the country.  Students came from Howard [University, Washington, D.C.]  I believe that's my first time meeting Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture, black nationalist] came.  And others met there and we boarded a bus to leave Montgomery to travel to Jackson, Mississippi.  We boarded the bus and the Alabama National Guard was in front of the bus, behind the bus in jeeps.  Some were on the bus, guarding the bus with their rifles drawn as we traveled down this highway from Montgomery to Jackson, Mississippi.  We get to the Mississippi state line.  The Mississippi National Guard meet us there and they lead us on into Jackson, Mississippi.  We get to Jackson, Mississippi, the National Guard lead us to the Greyhound bus station.  We go into the Greyhound bus station and we meet a captain.  His name was Ray.  Captain Ray of the Jackson Police Department.  And the only thing he would say to you, "Move on."  And you'd be moving.  Trying to test the so-called white waiting room.  The black students, black Freedom Riders would do that.  The so-called white Freedom Riders would test the so-called colored waiting room.  They'd test the restaurants, the restroom facilities and he would say, "Move on."  You're in the process of moving.  And at the same time, Captain Ray would say, "You're under arrest."  And he arrested us.  And took us to the city jail.  And people kept coming. We filled the city jail in Jackson.  Then later, people kept coming.  We filled the county jail.  And by the hundreds during that summer people came into the city of Jackson.  Then they made a decision to take us to the prison farm and put us to work.  And out on the prison farm one day, a young man named C. T. Vivian said something to one of the guards and he was hit, and they drew blood.  And they didn't like what they saw.  So they took us back to the county jail.  And the jail continued to fill.  And while we were in jail, we would sing freedom songs.  We would conduct nonviolent workshops.  And early one morning, on a Friday morning, the officials of Mississippi made a decision.  That they couldn't hold us all in the city jail, the county jail and the prison farm.  They were gonna take us to Parchman State penitentiary.  Now in the jails of Mississippi, the jails were segregated.  We were arrested together, black and whites, but when we got to the city jail or the county jail, they segregated the whites from the blacks.  But when they got ready to transfer us, down through the [Mississippi] Delta to Parchman State Penitentiary, they put us all on a huge van, together, and took us to Parchman.  And you get to Parchman to the maximum-security unit to this jail with his rifle drawn, he said, "Sing your goddamn freedom songs now.  We have niggers here that will beat you up or eat you up.  Sing your goddamn freedom songs now."  And we didn't know what was gonna happen.  Now I've heard about Parchman and we all heard about Parchman.  But we had never been to Parchman.  So we get to Parchman.  They tell us all to line up down a long hallway.  We line up facing these guards with their guns drawn.  They tell us to take off all of our clothing.  So you take off all your clothing.  You're just standing there nude, with nothing on.  It's just so dehumanizing.  And then in twos, they tell you to go and take a shower.  And so you go and take a shower.  And if you had any facial hair, a mustache, a beard--there's no mirrors around.  You're there shaving your mustache or your beard or--and you don't have any clothing.  Because you're there naked taking a shower and you don't have a weapon or anything.  But while you even taking a shower the guard is there with is gun drawn.  Then they lead us in twos and put us in a cell and you're still without clothing.  And an hour and a half later, they come back.  And they give us a pair of Mississippi state prison shorts and a undershirt.  That's what we kept on during the entire stay at Parchman State Penitentiary.  You couldn't have a book to read.  The only thing that you could read was the Bible.  You could only write one letter a week.  You couldn't have any visitors.  While I was there, someone from the Salvation Army came by and brought us a Bible.  And it was the New Testament and the book of Psalms.  And I still have that Bible.  One of my colleagues that was in jail wrote in the Bible, "Presented to John Lewis June 12th, 1961 by a man from the Salvation Army."  So that--I learned to read the New Testament over and over again during my stay there--and the books of Psalms.  Finally within forty days we were all released because we appealed our case.  We all had been sentenced to I believe it was sixty days or pay a $250 fine.  But we all stayed up to about forty--thirty-five or forty days in order to appeal and get released.

Speaker 1: Did the Freedom Rides really originate out of SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]?  Was that SNCC centered?  Or was it mo--It was a combination wasn't it?
Speaker 2: The Freedom Ride was conceived by CORE, the Congress of Racial Equality.  It was James Forman's idea.  Back in 1948, there had been something called 'the Journey of Reconciliation' where a group of progressive whites and blacks traveled through the South and they were beaten and arrested, and some of them were literally put on chain gangs.  Bayard Rustin, Jim Peck and several other people involved in that group.  Now there's one member of that group that is still alive today.  So the Freedom Ride was patterned behind 'the Journey of Reconciliation.'  James Forman had this whole idea that he wanted to test a decision of the United States Supreme Court prohibiting segregation in public transportation coming out of a case that occurred in Richmond, Virginia back in the early '60s [1960s]--Back in 1960.
Speaker 1: And so you were essentially just very active in the [Civil Rights] Movement.  This is before you become executive director of SNCC.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) This is long before I became--.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) I mean--.
Speaker 2: the Chairman of SNCC.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) Chairman of SNCC.
Speaker 2: This is '61 [1961].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I didn't become Chair of SNCC until June of 1963.
Story_ID: 18506
Speaker 1: I know that there was fear,  but you felt--it sounds as if all the participants felt that the government was on your side.  And that, you know, there was a sense of sort of exhilaration, even mixed with danger.  That's--am I wrong?
Speaker 2: We had our concerns.  We had our fears.  And some people no doubt--we had reservations.  But we felt that the federal government would be there, that the government was on our side.  And sometime the government was not there when we needed it, or felt that the government should have intervened.  When the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] agent was standing by taking pictures or taking notes, we thought they should have been placing people under arrest.
Speaker 1: Well was this then around the time after the Freedom Rides that [U.S. Attorney General Robert F.] Kennedy suggested that blacks focus on voter education and registration?
Speaker 2: It was during that period.  It was during the summer of the Freedom Rides. It was during late May and June and July.  And Robert Kennedy started negotiating and meeting with people. And calling people to meet with him in New York [New York] and in Washington [D.C.], suggesting that there should be a cooling off period.  And that it would be more meaningful if people would turn their attention to voter registration.  And there was this great debate within SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee], within the [Civil Rights] Movement about whether we should go and get involved in voter registration or whether we should continue a campaign of nonviolent direct action.
Speaker 1: And what was the decision?  Did the decision exist that people were gonna get involved in voter registration?
Speaker 2: The decision was both--that we must do both.  We had to continue a campaign of nonviolent direct action, but we also had to get involved in voter registration.  And it was the [U.S. President John F.] Kennedy administration convincing several non-profit organizations and groups to make resources available--really New York-based foundations to set up something called the Voter Education Project which is part of the Southern Regional Council. This is where people would be able to give and donate tax deductible dollars and these dollars would be used for non-partisan attempts--efforts to gain the right to vote.  And it was hard--it was difficult.  It was supposed to be steady and researched, and people discovered early despite of the resources--in spite of all the efforts, it was gonna be almost impossible for black folks in the eleven states of the old Confederacy from Virginia to Texas to get registered.  That effort laid the foundation--created the climate, created the environment for the movement for the right to vote, that led to the passage of the Voters Rights Act a few years later.
Story_ID: 18507
Speaker 1: You were third chairman of SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee], and I want you to talk about how even that even came about, I knew you were contacted.
Speaker 2: Well I--as a student-participant and a local student leader in Nashville [Tennessee], I had been very involved in the sit-ins, the stand-in at the theaters, and had gone on the Freedom Rides and I continue to be involved all across the South.  As a matter of fact, during the summer of 1962 I became like a SNCC volunteer field secretary in southern Illinois and in Charleston, Missouri.  I was working in Cairo, Illinois and Charleston, Missouri, and it was very much like the heart of the Deep South.  There were places, public places--in Cairo, Illinois in summer of 1962, they had swimming pools and a recreation center that was financed by the public, but black people could not use it.  And in Charleston, Missouri there were restaurants--they were segregated--that blacks could not enter. So we got arrested in Charleston, Missouri, in Cairo--this is were Ohio [River] and the Mississippi [River] come together--this like any small southern town.  And I think the people in SNCC saw our effort there and they saw my involvement in Nashville, and when one of the chairs of SNCC decided he had been there I guess long enough, did all he could and he wanted to leave, James Forman, who had lived in Chicago [Illinois], who was, I believe, a native of Mississippi, but had been very active there, became the SNCC executive secretary, contacted me and said that several people think you should become chair of SNCC.  And so when a meeting was held in June 1963 by the coordinating committee, I was selected--or elected--the national chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.  So that's how I moved to Atlanta [Georgia].  And I believe that meeting took place in June 14th, 1963.  Seven days later--or less, about a week later--I was invited to come to Washington [D.C.] along with [Dr.] Martin Luther King, Jr., A. Philip Randolph, James Forman, Whitney Young, and Roy Wilkins, and a few other people--to participate in a meeting at the White House with [U.S.] President [John F.] Kennedy.  It was in that meeting--I was the youngest person, I was twenty-three years old--it was in that meeting that President Kennedy was so concerned about what was happening in the South, the tension--you had witness the dogs, the fire hoses in Birmingham [Alabama], the assassination of Medgar Evers--and A. Philip Randolph spoke up during the meeting, and said, "Mr. President," in his baritone voice he said, "Mr. President the (unclear) marshals arrested us, and we are going to march on Washington."  And you could tell by the very body language of President Kennedy he didn't like what he heard. He started moving and twisting in his chair.  He said, "Mr. Randolph if you bringing in all these people to Washington wouldn't there be chaos, won't there be disorder, wouldn't there be violence and we would never be able to get a Civil Rights Act through the Congress?"  And Mr. Randolph responded, "Mr. President, this will be an orderly, peaceful, non-violent protest," and Randolph didn't back down.  And President Kennedy sorted him the business, and President Kennedy sorta said, "We think we have problems." And he sorta said, "Well, we all have problems."  And Mr. Randolph said, "Mr. President, we are gonna work with you but we are going to march."  And the meeting was sort of downhill from then on--not much else was said ,and the rest of us didn't have anything to say.  A. Philip Randolph had said it all.  So we came out of the White House [Washington, D.C.] as a group--we spoke to the members of the media--.
Story_ID: 18508
Speaker 1: A lot of times people think of, you know, as I was getting ready to say the March on--you know, they don't think of A. Philip--they think of A. Philip Randolph with the Pullman porters, you know, and the whole labor movement. But he was a senior statesman by this time.
Speaker 2: Well, A. Philip Randolph was considered the dean of black leadership. He was such a principal of a man. And one thing--he was there when people tried to talk about other folks during the meeting.  And one thing I will never, ever forget what he said. He said, "If you cannot say something good about somebody, don't say anything. Just don't say anything." And during our first meeting, the very first meeting that we had to plan the March on Washington. It was July 2, 1963. This was after we had left the White House. And after we announced to the press that we've had a good meeting with the President [John F. Kennedy]. That we announced that we were going to--we told them that we were going to have a march on Washington [D.C.]. Then we go and meet in New York [New York].  And in that meeting, you had the six of us plus the deputies.  And like there was John Marcell from NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] who was working with Roy Wilkins. There was Fred Shuttlesworth and [Rev.] Ralph Abernathy with Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.]. James Forman was with me. And there were some people with James Forman from CORE [Congress for Racial Equality]. But Mr. Wilkins insisted that he wanted everybody else out of the meeting and only wanted the principals there. Bayard Rustin was there with A. Philip Randolph. And it was during that meeting, he insisted that everybody else leave the room. He only wanted the heads of the organizations. So that's what they came down to. And it became a knock down, drag out. And A. Philip Randolph kept saying, "Brethren." 'Cuz it was only men, six men. He kept saying, "Brethren, we come this far together. Let's stay together." This is before we even really could get into the meat of what the meeting and the agenda of the March was going to be all about. So it was during that meeting that some of us had proposed that Bayard Rustin be the head of the March--that he'd be the organizer to pull it together. But Mr. Wilkins objected to that because of Bayard Rustin's past, his history. He had been connected with several sort of leftist organizations and groups. And so they thought that people like [U.S. Senator] Herman Talmadge, [U.S. Senator Richard] Russell--Talmadge of Georgia--[U.S. Senator James O.] Eastland of Mississippi--and the southern senators would use that against the March and against the [Civil Rights] Movement. And so there were real questions about whether Bayard Rustin should be the head of the March. And A. Philip Randolph, we knew, wanted Bayard Rustin.  So we caucused.  Dr. King, James Forman and myself. We were considered the most liberal and progressive of the group--we felt. So we sort of suggested that we would leave it up to A. Philip Randolph to make the decision--who would direct he March. And at one point, Mr.Wilkins said, about Dr. King--I think Dr. King had stepped out of the room.  He didn't say it to his face.  He said, "Martin didn't know what he was talking about. He was political. He was naïve." Or something like that. "He was just a black minister." Something to that effect. But he would never, I don't think, say that to Dr. King in his presence. So we came back and made a decision after we came back together.  And said, "A. Philip Randolph  is our leader. He's highly respected. He's a dean of black leadership. Let him make the decision." And so everybody agreed to that. So Mr. Randolph selected Bayard Rustin to be like the deputy director or leader of the March on Washington. So it was Mr. Randolph as the head but in fact, it was Bayard Rustin who was doing the work. And so that's why we went down that road. But it was during some of those debates and discussions--'cause we met over and over again--that Mr. Randolph was--who believed in a mass effort.  Because he came out of the labor movement. And Dr. King because of the Montgomery [Alabama] Bus Boycott and his belief in the philosophy of non-violence. And James Forman as head of CORE would lead in direct action.  My involvement in SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]. So we were all sort of at the same point. Mr. Wilkins and Whitney Young wanted to be a little more caution and wanted us to support a particular piece of civil rights legislation. And we wanted a general march on Washington and we had a general theme for jobs and freedom.
Speaker 1: So I would assumed that the four more liberal--I mean won out over the two more conservatives, that what--?
Speaker 2: I--we did and we did it because in a sense, a lower segment of the population that was participating in the March was people who identified, several with Dr. King, and with A. Philip Randolph. Because A. Philip Randolph had organized labor. And Dr. King as a leader of a mass movement, really. But we needed the NAACP. We needed the Urban League. We needed Whitney Young. But they also--they needed us. You needed CORE, you needed SNCC, and you needed SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference].
Story_ID: 18509
Speaker 1: Now you know what--what strikes me you're a young kid for--I mean not--but you're a kid compared to people.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Yeah. I was very young.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) So was this--this was a really heady time sort of? Wasn't it? I mean, to be in the company of these men. Or, were you feeling--or were the young people feeling their oats because they had, they had really, you know, moved things along so to speak.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Well, I think--we felt that we had a right to be at the table. That we had a right to be there because of the role that we had played in the sit-ins, in the Freedom Rides.  And Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.]was so happy. He was so pleased to see the young people involved in a mass participation. But I was forced to grow up. I, was forced to grow up overnight.  And I did, 'cause during that summer leading up to the March on Washington [D.C.], I traveled all across the country recruiting people, speaking and telling stories about what was happening in the South and why it was so important for people to come by train, bus, or car, or whatever way they could to make it to Washington.
Story_ID: 18510
Speaker 1: And was Bayard Rustin--was he really the very skilled organizer that he's known to, you know?
Speaker 2: Bayard Rustin was very--he was brilliant.  Really brilliant, very smart. He really--he had the--he had the ability. He had the capacity to put things together. And he would be talking sometimes on two telephones at the same time, or writing here and taking notes here, telling this person to go here and to go there. He was able to hold things together. And I think he knew.  He knew the mind. He knew how to deal with all of us. He didn't want the young people to be overlooked. He didn't want to do anything that pushed Whitney Young or Roy Wilkins the wrong way.  And he wanted to pacify Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] and James Forman. But he ultimately--he wanted to answer--he knew he had to answer to A. Philip Randolph.  And sometimes, he would refer to--he would say, "Mr. Randolph" or either, "The old man." "Mr. Randolph--." Mostly he said, "Mr. Randolph" or "The old man." But no one, none of us really in our right mind, could openly disagree with A. Philip Randolph. If he said something, the way he said it--it was so convincing and he was so right about it. 'Cause this guy, he didn't have any bones to pick. He just wanted to do the right thing. He didn't appear to be jealous of anybody, he didn't want--he didn't have any vent or beat for any particular organization or group. He just wanted to do the right thing. And he wanted us all to be fair. And you couldn't say no to A. Philip Randolph. And I've always said, that if this man had been born in another time, in another place--maybe if he had been another color, maybe he would have been president, maybe king, maybe prime minister. He was such a wonderful human being. So even during--leading up to the March on Washington [D.C.], the day before The March on Washington, some people had problems with the speech that I had prepared and wanted to change my speech because some people thought it was too strong, it was too inflammatory. I thought the speech was very mild. I thought the speech reflected the views of the people that we were working with--the views of the people in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee [SNCC]. And at one point, we were negotiating, even after the March itself had started. We were sitting behind  Mr. Lincoln [Lincoln Memorial] working on making the changes. And Mr. Randolph said to me, "John, let's make these changes for the sake of unity." And one part of the speech, where I said near the end, "We cannot be patient. We want our freedom and we want it now!" I said, "You tell us to wait and to be patient. But we cannot be patient. We cannot wait." I said, "The black masses are restless. We're involved in a serious revolution." Some people wanted me to delete that. And A. Philip Randolph came to my rescue. And he said, "There's nothing wrong with the use of the word masses. There's nothing wrong with the use of the word revolution. I use it myself sometime."  So that remained in the speech. And Bayard Rustin, at one point, said to me, "Maybe you shouldn't say 'we cannot be patient.'  Because the Catholic church believes in being patient." It was the Archbishop of the Washington diocese who said he objected to the speech because it was too inflammatory.  It was too militant. But we were lead to believe that there were people within the [John F.] Kennedy administration, were friends of the Archbishop that got him to say he will refuse to give invocation if I didn't change the speech. So that whole business of not being patient stayed in there.  The black masses stayed in there.  The whole thing about revolution stayed in there. But the point that people further wanted me to change was near the end of the speech I said, "If we do not see meaningful progress, the day may come when we will not confine our marching on Washington. But we may be forced to march through the South the way [U.S. Civil War Union General William T.] Sherman did non-violently." So people really objected to that. And Dr. King said, "John that doesn't sound like you." And that's when Mr. Randolph really came down.  And--not hard, but said, "John, let's change that for the sake of unity. We've come this far together. Let's stay together." And I changed it.

Speaker 1: How many people was anticipated? Was this--was the goal to have a march that was the largest march of its kind? Was that the goal? Or was it just that we were gonna now take it to the state--the nation's capitol? What was--what were--you know this--you look at now, The Million Man March, you know, he said, "We're gonna  get a million people." I'm just, you know--.
Speaker 2: Back in 1963, we didn't play the numbers game. Even going back to the sit-ins or Freedom Rides, we never said--we never gave out numbers. We never said we would have forty thousand or fifty thousand or two hundred thousand.  We said, "We would  have a March on Washington And whosoever will let them come. But it will be orderly, peaceful, non-violent." And they accept the goals of this effort, as Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] would say, "To redeem the soul of America. To end those barriers, to bring down those signs. It was a march for jobs and freedom." And we were called--there was a young lady working in the New York [New York] office of the March working with Bayard Rustin.  Her name was Rochelle Horowitz  And she was like a--we would call Rochelle and say, "Rochelle, How many buses are coming out of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]? How many buses are coming out of New York? How many buses are coming out of Boston [Massachusetts]? How many buses coming out of Chicago [Illinois]? How many people are going to be on a train coming out of the South? How many people are going to be coming from California?" And she would be able to tell us any time of day. So we thought maybe, just maybe, we'd have maybe forty, fifty, or sixty thousand  people. And that morning, August 28, 1963, we got up early that morning.  The six of us. We left our hotel. We got in cars. We came to Capitol Hill [Washington, D.C.] to meet with Republicans and Democrats on both sides of the Capitol.  Senators, members of the House of Representatives. And we came from the Senate side, after our meetings, and we saw a sea of humanity. Unbelievable! Hundreds and thousands of people leaving Union Station, leaving the train. We saw all type of people. Just a sea of people, just--you know, it was like the number that no person could number. And it was like saying,  "There go my people. We're their leaders. Let us catch up with them." The people was gone! They were already marching! And we just caught hands and start walking and the people, the sea, just literally pushed us along. And we just walked and walked until we made it to the Lincoln Memorial. When I look back on it and I see the still photograph, the video of that sea, to me, it's one of the most undercount of all time. The local park police and others say it was only 250,000. But you had hundreds and thousands of people there that day. Up until that time, probably it was the largest assembly that Washington had ever witnessed. There were people that surrounded the reflection pool. You could see hundreds and thousands of people with their feet hanging in the pool. There were people that went up in the trees to try and get a better view.  And even when the program of the March was over, there were people still trying to get into Washington when the program was over. President [John F.] Kennedy and the local officials--even the [U.S.] Department of Justice.  They were so concerned.  They were so frightened that we wouldn't have an orderly, peaceful protest. They ordered the closing of all the liquor stores. They had troops, U.S. Marshals and others on standby all around the city. They wanted us to be in and out before sundown. I remember during the discussion leading up to the March.  Because President Kennedy and the people in the administration didn't want it--to happen. But they saw it was going to happen. And then they tried to be helpful, with the sound system, went to the podium, "We're having park service employees and police from the park service to assist." But I remember one meeting--during one meeting Bayard Rustin made a very classic statement. We had finished everything now.  The podium, the sound system, and Bayard said, "Do we have enough latrines?" He said, "We cannot have any disorganized pissing in Washington." He was so concerned that we have enough latrines. So there were plenty latrines all over the place. The March on Washington to me--that day when I looked out and saw that sea of humanity--black, white, Protestant, Catholic, Jews, men, women, children, rich, poor.  It was America at her best. I've heard Dr. King speak on many, many occasion.  But on this particular day, this young man, this young black Baptist minister from Georgia spoke from his soul. And Mahalia Jackson, she was at her best. She did more than one song, but that she did a gospel about "How I Got Over." And it was a--it was a day of jubilee. And I think we shared our feelings, our dreams, our hopes, our longings for America. We left the Lincoln Memorial as a group. We got in cars and we went directly to the White House for a meeting with President Kennedy. And he stood in the door of the Oval Office and he greeted each one of us. And he was just beaming.  He was so happy.  He was so proud. And he said, "I watched you. I saw you. I saw everything." He was so happy that everything had gone so well.  He was beside himself. And he kept on saying, "You did a good job. You did a good job. I'm proud of you." And we took seat--we stood and posed for a photograph with him.  And I believe we had cookies and orange juice with him. That was my last time seeing President Kennedy alive.
