Speaker 1: This photo is a very special photo.  This is one of my good friends, a, a very good mentor and person who's made us all proud because he's proven that it doesn't matter where you come from, if you set your mind, and you work hard, and understand the value of education and commitment that you can succeed and can do anything you want.  And so it's funny when I hear the jokes on television, and I'm gonna call Johnnie Cochran, well, Johnnie Cochran is the kind of lawyer that everybody around the globe loves to have at their defense on the, on the team.  And so Johnnie's been a very active member of the 100 Black Men.  There's membership in the Los Angeles [California] and the New York Chapter, and a very good friend.
Speaker 2: Moving from left to right, the first gentleman is Bill Simms.  He's the president and CEO of the 100 Black Men of America.  We hired Bill, well, last spring to be our day-to-day manager of our operations for the 100 Black Men of America.  And next to him is Roger from ING.  ING, of course, financial services has donated over 1.5 million to the 100 Black Men over the last three years.  But even more importantly, they'd worked with us hand-in-in on our programs.  Our corporation of the year in this photo was ING.  Next to him is my good friend, my mentor, my neighbor the homerun king in Hank Aaron, who's a member of the 100 Black Men of Atlanta [Georgia], and a man that I have all of the respect for, who, who continues to, to break down barriers and work hard.  Next to him is [HM] Tavis Smiley.  Tavis was our Man of the Year.  Hank got our Trail Blazers Award, by the way.  Tavis Smiley was our Man of the Year, and Tavis really needs no introduction.  He's doing a tremendous job in helping to deal with those cutting edge issues and working hard to make sure that our folks understand what time it is.  And next, next to him is Darien Dash.  Darien's a young--he was our Emergent Entrepreneur recipient.  Darien's a young brother out of New Jersey who beat all of the odds in terms of the, the M.O. that they give to young men who can't succeed.  When you consider the challenges from his family, the fact that his grandmother had to raise him, and all of those other factors, he became the first African American to have a technology company that was traded publicly.  He's one of our corporate partners and working with us on our technology development centers around the country.  These were our recipients and individuals that we are proud of because they're making a difference.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  How does Darien spell his first name?
Speaker 2: D-A-R-I-E-N.
Speaker 1: Moving from left to right is our former executive director, Dwayne Ashley, who now heads up the Thurgood Marshall Scholarship Fund in New York.  And next to him is Ray Allen [Jr.], a young man who's doing a tremendous job on and off the basketball court.  He's one of our honorary members and spends time with us at our conferences talking to young people, letting them understand that athletics and basketball can be the means to the end and not the end in terms of using your talents and skills as a career but understanding that you can't play that sport for life.  And he's been very good at, at spending the time making it real for the young people.  And so he has been one of the guests that Nike has brought in, and he's been very active with us in our Milwaukee [Wisconsin] chapter as well as nationally.  And then next to me is one of the up and coming and emerging football greats that joined us at--this was at Justin's in New York during the NBA All-Star weekend.  This is, of course, one of the New York Giants' football players who came over to spend the time with us.  this was taken in February of 1999.  Oh, wait a minute--February of 1998.
Story_ID: 58889
Speaker 1: Again, moving from left to right, Dwayne Ashley, our executive director--former executive director.  And next to him is one of our members from the New York chapter, and then next to him is, of course, Johnnie Cochran doing his thing.  And the gentleman last pictured in this photo is my hero, this is the Honorable [HM] [Representative] John Lewis, Congressman [HM] John Lewis, one of the civil rights greats--person--who has become a tireless advocate and soldier for, for the downtrodden and, and, and for those who have no voice.  And [HM] John Lewis, of course, was also my neighbor.  We lived a block from each other until, until we moved, as we say in the South, down the road a little bit.  We moved over to another neighborhood.  But [HM] John [Lewis] continues to be a friend, a member of the 100 Black Men of Atlanta and a great leader.
Speaker 2: This is Dick Gregory.  Dick Gregory, moving my--who's pictured with me here.  [HM] Dick Gregory is, is a great friend.  He's been a wonderful advisor, everything from those issues dealing with the health to understand what the global issues are.  And I met [HM] Dick [Gregory] first in 1971 when I was Student Government President at Fort Valley State University [Georgia].  I drove over to pick up [HM] Dick Gregory in Albany [Georgia].  As you know in South Georgia there, there, there were no airports back and forth to get, get you around, so I drove over.  From the time he got in my care to the time that we arrived in, arrived in, in Fort Valley he talked the whole way.  But [HM] Dick Gregory, a great leader.  This photo was taken in January 2002 at the Trumpet Awards.  We were there to autograph books at the Meet the Authors reception.
Speaker 1: This photo, moving from left to right, is a photo with my old college professor at Fort Valley State University [Georgia], Dr. Robert Threatt to who later became president of Morris Brown College [Georgia].  And next to him is his wife, Helen, very good friends, and they remain good friends of mine.  I worked with him.  He was a former president of the Atlanta [Georgia] branch NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  Next to Helen is [HM] Joe Rogers, the lieutenant governor of Colorado and a member of my Denver chapter.  He's the only current sitting lieutenant governor in the continental United States.  And next to him is his wonderful wife, who is making a difference and a great partner of [HM] Joe [Rogers].  As I said, Joe is the only lieutenant governor in the Continental U.S.  We have a second lieutenant governor in the Virgin Islands U.S. Territory who also happens to be a member and the president of my chapter there.  But this--again, Joe's a wonderful friend and a person who's been supportive.  This photo was taken in December of 2001 during the Presidents' Summit.  [HM] Joe [Rogers] came in for a reception--no, let me back up.  This was taken in June of 2001 at a reception during the national convention that was held here in Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  And what's his called--threat?
Speaker 1: Threatt is T-H-R-E-A-T-T.
Speaker 2: This photo, of course, with my leader, my fraternity brother, Governor Doug Wilder, and with him, of course, is [HM] Dick Gregory.  Doug [Wilder] has been a person that's made us proud.  As, as we all know, he's the first African-American governor during modern times.  As we know, P.B.S. Pinchback was the first African-American governor of Louisiana.  But Governor Wilder's a person who, again, has shown young people if you want it bad enough and you work hard enough you can succeed; and of course [HM] Dick Gregory, the man.  And so this is at the--at a reception that we attended during the, during the Trumpet Awards of January 2002.
Speaker 1: This photo, moving from left to right, is with a good friend.  Ken is the vice president for human resources for UPS.  And this is a happy day.  You see me grabbing that piece of paper.  And next to me on the other side is Evern Cooper, who is the director of the UPS Foundation and vice president of UPS.  This was a check presentation for a million dollar check that UPS gave to the 100 Black Men of America to assist us in our volunteerism development program, capacity building program, and to support our national scholarship program.  And so this photo was taken in 1998, again, as one of the grantees for the UPS Foundation for capacity building for community based organizations.
Story_ID: 58890
Speaker 1: These pictured in this photo with me, the young men from Soweto [South Africa].  They joined us at our national convention in 1997.  They were in as guests of Ambassador [HM] Andrew Young and some of the other local dignitaries.  There were in on their national tour of the United States, and we were blessed with their presence.  They came in--these three young men, the harmony that they, that they bring in their performances is just unbelievable.  And so they stopped by at our conference and that--it just so happened that was '97' [1997] in Atlanta [Georgia].  And they performed for said evening and a tremendous performance.  And we were just so proud and happy to have them there, because it also--and sharing of their talent they also shared their, their journey.  And it's a part of helping us all to understand that no matter where you are in the globe we all have common interests, and we have common goals, and they share that in their music, in their voices.
Speaker 2: This is one my best times.  This is a chance for me to present to a good friend.  But I'll start moving from left to right.  The young lady is Tiffany Cochran [Edwards].  She's the daughter of Johnnie Cochran, but here in Atlanta [Georgia], Tiffany has made a name for herself as one of our, our effective TV hosts for 11Alive television station.  And she was the mistress of ceremony at this awards luncheon at our 2001 national convention here in Atlanta [Georgia].  This is at the Chairman's Awards Luncheon.  And I'm presenting to Dr. Joshua Murfree, who has been my only national chair for mentoring and the only national chair in the history of our organization for mentoring.  I had the opportunity to present this award for his years of service.  Dr. Murfree is the individual who helped to really establish our national mentoring program, mentoring the 100 way to ensure that wherever you are in the 100 organization mentoring is the same.  And he's vice president of Albany State University [Georgia], a clinical psychologist and a great leader.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  And spell Murfree.
Speaker 2: And Murfree is M-U-R-F-E-E, Joshua Murfree.
Speaker 1: This is a photo from 1996, and--no, this, this photo is from 1997.  In the photo is Vince Berkley, Senior Vice President of Burger King.  These young people with Vince are participants from their mentoring program that they have in conjunction with the 100 Black Men of South Florida.  Burger King has a tremendous commitment to building communities through mentoring programs.  And they've been one of our biggest supporters over the years.  And Vince is also a member of the 100 Black Men of South Florida.  These young people are the future leaders of America and the world.  And what we believe in 100, you should start with them early, helping them to hone and develop those leadership skills so that they will take their rightful place.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  Was there a particular reason that these, these individuals in the photograph with you were singled out?  Did they win any kind of an award, or are they just representatives in general or?
Speaker 1: These young people participated in our African-American History Challenge.  And these were the finalists in the junior division of the African-American History Challenge of the 100 Black Men of America.  And let me just correct the date.  This actually was taken in New Orleans [Louisiana], and that was in June 1998.  Yeah, June 1998 in New Orleans, and these were the finalists in the junior division of the History Challenge.
Speaker 2: Moving from left to right, my good friend [HM] Frank Ski, who is a number one radio show host here and in Atlanta, Georgia.  Frank is a member of the 100 Black Men of Atlanta.  He has his own sinagade--syndicated radio talk show and is doing a tremendous job for our organization and for our community.  Next to Frank is Sharon Campbell.  Sharon is the wife of former mayor [Atlanta, Georgia], [HM] Bill Campbell, and a tremendous educator here in our city.  She's done a tremendous job for our children in the city of Atlanta [Georgia].  And of course [HM] Bill Campbell, the former mayor of Atlanta [Georgia], who's a member of the 100 Black Men who is very actively involved around the country and international, helping us to build the organization's legacy.  And so this was at a December 2001 going away party that several hundreds of people turned out in support of [HM] Bill [Campbell] and his eight years as mayor of Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  Okay, and for the captioning department, Mr. [HM Frank] Ski's name is S-K-I, correct?
Speaker 2: That's correct, [HM] Frank Ski, S-K-I, from WAOK.  He's from [Washington] D.C. ball--by way of Baltimore [Maryland], and now WAOK radio station here in--I mean WV-103, V103 radio station here in at--in at--in Atlanta [Georgia].
Story_ID: 58891
Speaker 1: This photo is--moving from left to right, of course, is with a lady who has carried a tremendous burden but a lady that understood that in order for the legacy of one of our nation's greatest men to be never forgotten, Mrs. Coretta Scott King.  We honored her for her dynamic leadership and what she has done in keeping the dream alive as well as making the dream a reality.  And next to her is the national vice chairman of operations, [HM] Al[bert] Dotson, a young attorney out of Miami, Florida, who's doing a tremendous job in the leadership for our organization.  This was in September of 2001 at our Fall Leadership Conference, our black tie gala that we were so happy to honor Mrs. Coretta Scott King for her leadership.  She's never missed our event in Washington [D.C.], and she's been a real friend and a, a lady who has made a tremendous difference.  And in light of all of the pain and suffering, she never gave up.
Speaker 2: This is a photo take and this was in--just recently.  And we were in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] at the--no, let me back up.  This photo was taken in September 2001 during the Fall Leadership Conference on our cruise on the Potomac.  And this is, is Ms. Brown--let's see, can we hold on that one--not Georgia Brown.  She'd kill me.  What's the gossip columnist?  Brown--I'll come back to this one.  Can we--she's got, she's got a national--she has a national gol--gossip column.  No, I'll tell you what, if we can show this--let's pull that one.  Can we come back?  If we can hold I can have them tell you real quick.  Her name is Foxy Brown [HM Jamie Brown].  But go ahead.  Foxy, but go ahead and ask him for sure.
Speaker 1: This is, again, a photo--I love these kinds of photos.  First is with president and CEO, Bill Simms, a gentleman we hired in, in the spring of, of 2001.  We were fortunate to--after a national search, to secure the services of William Simms, as our president and CEO.  He manages our day-to-day operations for the 100 Black Men of America.  And in the middle is our good friend--is Rodney from ING here.  ING presents a check for $600,000 to the 100 Black Men of America at our June 2001 national conference that was held here in Atlanta.  This was at our black tie gala.  And ra--Rodney, again, represents ING, which has given over 1.5 million to the 100 Black Men of America over the last three years.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  And how does Mr. Simms spell his name?
Speaker 1: It's I--S-I-M-M-S.  And Rodney--let me say-
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  N-E-Y--R-O-D-N-E-Y or R-O-D-N-Y?
Speaker 1: R-O-D-N-E-Y.
Speaker 2: And this is [HM] Jamie--Foxy Brown as we, we call her, who does a tremendous job in keeping all the good stuff that's going out in the community.  And she--if you wanna get all the real dirt and all the real information on what's going out there.  But this lady has the ability to pull people together, and she's done that, been a very good friend and supporter of, of me and the 100 [Black Men].  And we were on the cruise on the Potomac where we take individuals out and cruise the Potomac and have a good time and fellow it.  And this is a presentation that we, we put together that night.  She was one of our special guests.
Speaker 1: No, this is not my birthday.  This, this cake represents a great evening.  This was a rolling out of our premier issue of our national magazine called the "The 100."  And from left to right, [HM] Calvin Smyre, who is the chairman of [Georgia] State Democratic Party.  He is the-[HM] Calvin [Smyre] is also the ranking member--third highest ranking member of the Georgia General Assembly.  He chairs the Rule's Committee.  And more importantly, [HM] Calvin [Smyre] was my classmate and, and is a fraternity brother of mine from Fort Valley State University [Georgia].  He's executive vice president of Synovus Bank.  And beside Calvin is Shirley Franklin, the first female mayor ever of Atlanta [Georgia] and the first Africa-American female mayor of any major Southern city.  And Shirley has done a tremendous job already in only less than sixty days office.  But she also ran this city as its chief executive officer for [Atlanta, Georgia] Mayor [HM] Andrew Young--former Mayor [HM] Andrew Young.  And she's done a tremendous job, and we just know that she's gonna be one of the greatest mayors this city will have.  Next to her is Tamara Brown.  Tamara is the publisher for the "100" magazine.  We were able to secure the services of Tamara after looking at some of the great successes she had had before in helping other organizations establish their national communication organ.  And, and then next to her is Bill Simms again.  We're cutting the cake, commemorating the first premier de--commemorating the premier edition of the '100' magazine.  That was here in Atlanta [Georgia]on February the 28th of 2002.
Story_ID: 58892
Speaker 1: And this is a copy of the premier issue of the '100' magazine and, and this magazine is the newest, and hottest, and will continue to be our major way of addressing issues of concern to, one, African-American men of our families and community and to address the kind of global issues that, that must be dealt with and cutting edge issues.  As you notice here, we've featured [HM] Tavis Smiley, who lands on his feet, how a challenge becomes a multimillion dollar opportunity for him.  And we featured three of our members who are retiring as mayors, Dennis Archer, [HM] Marc Morial, and [HM] Bill Campbell.  And we talk about not necessarily we call it new directions, but what we call is retooling in the inside of the things that we're doing  in the organization.  But anything that, that we're involved in involves education, mentoring health and wellness, and economic development.  And this magazine features all those key areas as well as highlights young leaders and, again, issues that impact our community.  This is the '100' magazine, the premier edition.  This, again, was rolled out on February 28th, the first issue, and then the next issue will be in June, and it will be a quarterly publication.
Speaker 2: Moving from left to right, this photo is taken December 2001.  It's at the farewell gathering for Mayor [HM] Bill Campbell, where just hundreds of individuals turned out to say thank you for eight years of service.  Of course the first person is Mayor [HM] Bill Campbell, and next to him is, is one of his staff persons who worked in his community outreach program.  And then moving over is Jan Bryson, who is a successful businesswoman who's done a tremendous job out in our communities, and making a difference, and giving back.  And next to her is the former chief of staff for the mayor and current successful attorney in our, in our community now working at Long and Aldridge.  And these are all part of the family saying farewell to, to, to [HM] Bill Campbell on that night in December.  Again, the last is Attorney Steve Labovitz, very good friend of the mayor.  His wife was a classmate of [HM] Bill [Campbell] in college, and he's making a difference.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  Can you spell that name please?
Speaker 2: L-A-B-O-V-I-T-Z.  And I know this is--oh, gracious, I'll come back--well, with Campbell.  And then next is Glenda Minkin, Minkin, M-I-N-K-I-N, and Jan Bryson, and Steve Labovitz.  These are all part of the coordinating group for the farewell event, which was hosted by the National Black MBA Association, Atlanta chapter in December in Atlanta [Georgia], December 2001 at City Hall Atrium.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  The one thing we didn't spell is Bryson.
Speaker 2: B-R-Y-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: This is a photo of my mentor, Maynard Jackson, who, this man you can't give enough credit to what he did to move this city and, and opening up opportunities throughout not only hear in Atlanta [Georgia], throughout the nation.  He is considered the father of joint ventures who--the father of joint ventures who decided during his term if, if African Americans and women aren't gonna be involved in building our new airport, there will be no new airport.  And he held out until individuals came to the table, to the point that forty percent of the Hartsfield Airport [Atlanta, Georgia] had minority business participation.  And Maynard [Jackson] took (unclear), a tremendous leader, and a member of the 100 Black Men of, of Atlanta [Georgia], and a person who I can go to at any time to really get the kind of mentoring and leadership that, that makes a difference.
Story_ID: 58893
Speaker 1: This is a photo with my wife, Carole Dortch.  This was taken around 1996.  Carole and I got married a little over sixteen years ago.  And she's been the stabilizer in my life.  And as she says, with our son, if he'd been the first, he would be the (laughter) only child.  She gives me credit for my namesake, Thomas W. Dortch, III.  But this is my wife, who's a tremendous leader in her own right, one of the top executives, having been a presidential appointee.  But even more importantly, she was the first budget director of Maynard Jackson when he was first elected mayor, the director of the Bureau of General Services and the regional administrator of GSA [General Services Administration], a job she left previously that had fourteen hundred employees and a four billion a year budget.  She's now the assistant general manager of Hartsville Airport [Atlanta, Georgia].  But even more importantly, this lady is the stabilizer in, in my life and in the family.  So this is Carole.

Story_ID: 58895
Speaker 1: And I ask five questions of everyone.  There a little People magazine-ish.  But I'd like to know what your favorite food is.
Speaker 2: My favorite food is, of course, I got kind of a split between, of course, real soul food, being born here in the South the way, as they say, mom made it; and love Chinese food; I love it (laughter).  It's a good combination.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--(unclear)--Southern boy too.
Speaker 2: Hey, love it.  A meal is not a meal without cornbread when you have vegetables.
Speaker 1: A favorite--your favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color, and they try to tell me it's not a color, I love black.  I don't care what anybody says, I love black.  After that I'll wear olive, but I love black.
Speaker 1: A favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Favorite of time of year, I love the summer.  I love to deep sea fish and do all those good things.  So summer's, summer's my favorite time.  It's hot here in the South, but I love it.
Speaker 1: Favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I love the Caribbean Islands, love water, love beaches, love the warm weather.  I hate cold weather.  So the Caribbean Islands have basically been my (unclear); after that, of course, Maui and Hawaii, where we love, but Caribbean Islands.
Speaker 1: And favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I like Dr. Benjamin Mays's saying because I've lived by that: "We make your living by what we get.  We make our lives by what we give."
Speaker 1: I haven't heard that before.  Okay, we're gonna start.  Is there--is, is that a window that's open or it's just the-
Speaker 2: It's unfortunate--that's Auburn Avenue.
Speaker 1: No problem.
Speaker 2: It's good.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's What D. T. Walton had to put up with when he was on this floor (laughter).
Story_ID: 58896
Speaker 1: I wanna start out by you talking about your parents.  And, and I'd like you to first talk about your mother and give her name, and you know, tell us where you--she was from and-
Speaker 2: Right.  Well, my, my mother, Elizabeth Dortch--but I always grew up--we always called her Lizzie, of course.  My mother was born in LaGrange, Georgia, and at an early age moved from LaGrange, Georgia, to, to Toccoa, Georgia.  My mom started out pretty much working early on as a housekeeper.  And from there she--what we said, she really raised a lot of leaders in this, in this state because the Strubels and the Ramseys, who were attorneys and all, she kept their homes.  And then later on in life, mom kind of changed her, her career and profession.  And she worked at daycare centers really helping to counsel and helping to really develop the little young kids in preschool.  She went on back to college, went to college and got her training to be able to work there.  And she retired working at child development--the Toccoa-Stephens County Child Development Center in Toccoa, Georgia.  Mom, a solid lady, she--in growing up she's the lady that--we didn't realize until we were older she was a disciplinarian, a loving mother.  In my day, she used the switch.  She used to break those little blan--branches and plait 'em.  That's when the real--a real little solid reinforcement was in place.  And we laughed because mom used to do that when she had to discipline us and then call and say, "I'm gonna tell your dad."  We used to beg our mom to just whup us, as we called it, only to find out as adults, dad just raised his voice, pull out his belt, hit you one time.  But mom was super.  She was a lady who built bridges.  She's the one that helped us have our good solid core values; taught us, all of us--I have with my siblings and all--taught us that you respect and you treat everybody the same; that you never look down on anybody, but you didn't have to look up to anybody either in terms of thinking that you were less.  So Lizzie Dortch was the solid rock of, of our family who really today everybody loves her.  And we got so many young people and so many adults now who were impacted by, by my mother because she was such, and is, such a sweet and kind lady.  I tell my son today if mom says do it, I'd do it.  And so that's, that's the, the lady who will always have my heart.
Speaker 1: Did she share with you any stories about her growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, mom always talked to us about, of course, our grandmother and how my, my [her] grandmother, Adeline Hickman, how even when her sister and their cousins as adults, and even when they were married, she would talk about how our grandmother would even get on them about coming home late when they were married and how--I mean mom, in about--of course, her sister, which she died a few years back, but how they, again, in growing up how her--this was her great grandmother 'cause her mother left early, married, and moved to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], which that's the grandmother I didn't know.  But my great grandmother, Adeline, was the, the lady I remember going, 'cause she could sure, as we say, through down.  She could cook some biscuits and corn and all.  But, but she talked to us a lot about growing up and how, again, discipline worked for them, talked about how it was always important that they learn and even though they didn't go through the twelfth grades as we did, but how education still was important to, to their, to their grandparents, and how it was the solid foundation for growing up and even being deprived of the kind of education, how, again, understanding what education they did get, how it was so important to succeed.
Story_ID: 58897
Speaker 1: Now your father, can you give us his name and tell us-
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: About him?
Speaker 2: My father is Thomas W. Dortch, Sr.  My father was an entrepreneur.  He got started in business, though he had been what was known as a mess sergeant.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA INTERRUPTION): Sorry.
Speaker 2: I'll go again.  My father was an entrepreneur.  He had gotten started in his business from the military as a mess sergeant.  My dad unfortunately--but it didn't really make a different, because education was good for their time.  I think my dad did five years of, of school, because then at--being born in 19--1919, they had to work hard.  And of course, the opportunities we have today they had nothing even close to that.  And so everybody had to work and share the family needs.  And he went off to the military just as his brothers did.  And, and dad came back and used what he learned in the military, just as so many young people did during the '60's [1960s], and '70's [1970s], and even the '80's [1980s], and in the, in the '50' [1950s], who didn't have the opportunities, even though it was later in life like my dad, used that as opportunity to provide for his family.  My father owned restaurants all in the South all the way up to Ashville, North Carolina, up to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in Baltimore [Maryland] where he and his brother had their restaurant, who also ended up using his experience in the military in scoping that restaurant.  Dad had what would be formally called today the neighborhood pawnshop.  But the difference between the pawnshops today and then is dad took "jump" and took things that he knew he'd never get the money back for.  But it was part of what was done in our community, helping each other.  And I learned from my dad, and he believed in education, and he made sure everyone of us--there are six of us, six siblings.  Every one of us graduated from high school.  And he stayed on us.  My brother [John Dortch], of course, was the first to go and complete four years of college, the one next to me.  My sisters had--well, my older sister [Juanita] attended college, and she left before her senior year.  She went three years, and then she got married and, and traveled the world because her husband's in the military.  So my oldest sister did it in--but all of us had some form of educational training.  I followed my brother to college.  But dad made sure we understood that he was a disciplinarian, but he was also a, a person who wanted to make sure that all of us had the essentials in life.  Now dad was a softy even though we thought he was the, the enforcer in the family.  When we got in trouble dad would go in the room when he was supposed to discipline you, hit you a couple of times with the belt, raise his voice, and you sit there in just silence.  And that used to be the killer, just to sit there, just silence after dad has raised his voice.  And then he'd say, "Now go out there, and don't let your mama call me again."  And so, again as I say, you put it in perspective as adults now, but the one thing about, about our father was if our mother said one something had to be one way, it was that way.

Speaker 1: But he, he and the, the business folks in our community, even though I grew up in Toccoa, Georgia, which was only ten percent African American, it's a segregated city that I grew up in.  As a matter fact, I graduated from the last segregated high school [Whitman Street High School, Toccoa, Georgia], and my class was the last class at a segregated high school.  Dad and his associates from the ministers, and the business owners, and, and the teachers all band together, and usually whatever candidate they supported in the, in the local election they won.  And so dad had a, a very good relationship with the elected official, even to the point that when I graduated from high school, he went down there with this guy, Sam Elroy, who was the head of the draft board.  And I remember dad saying, "If my son and the sons of my friends in the community get drafted, then I expect your son and the rest of the sons in your community to be drafted also."  We didn't get drafted.  I mean we were good students.  I was salutatorian in my class, missed [Valedictorian] it by a point--two percentage points of my closest friend in being valedictorian.  But that was the way they operated.  There was a mutual understanding and a mutual respect for each other's position and, and influence.  And--but dad taught me a lot.  He taught me a lot about business.  I got to count the money.  My older brothers, they were the ones who learned how to cook and do all of that.  But dad, for some reason his namesake and the youngest, I was the math whiz kid in, in, in high school, and, and also he used that.  So that was--dad was, again, as I said, he was a, a person who stood up, a man who did what he had to do for the community.  And you know, it's, it's fun.  I mean I also--dad, in his restaurants, he sold at they called the bootleg liquor, which was coming in North Georgia.  But a lot of the "bootleg liquor" came from across the state line.  We--I was born seven miles from South Carolina, so they'd go buy the, the bottled liquor and sell it 'cause you couldn't--it had the South Carolina seal, 'cause we were what they would call a dry county.  And when James Brown came to town, who's a good friend, my first cousin, Bobby Byrd, who was one of the original [James Brown and the] Flames, by--James [Brown] would call my dad and say,"I'm comin'.  We gotta have some White Lightning, Tom [Dortch, Sr.]."  And so he--and of course, what was so funny, all the White Lightning [alcohol] was made by the, the white manufacturers, as we called them, in North Georgia.  They had all those big steels in--but it was funny.  And dad had that relationship with the sheriff and all of those, even to the point if there was gonna be a raid--it's so funny--he'd get a call.  And that was the way they operated, a mutual respect.  But I learned a lot from my father, and the most important thing from him and my parents was always treat everybody like real people and to never get the big head.  No matter what your success is to understand you were blessed, understand that but by the grace of God you could have been anywhere else.  And that's followed always--all way through life.
Speaker 2: Did--now your father was originally from Tocco--Toccoa too, right?
Speaker 1: Right, Toccoa right in the Martin community right there.
Speaker 2: Okay, and that's in North Georgia?
Speaker 1: North Georgia.
Speaker 2: Okay.  It's T-O-C-C-0-
Speaker 1: O-A.
Speaker 2: Well, you spell it.
Speaker 1: T-O-C-C-O-A.
Story_ID: 58899
Speaker 1: Right.  Now you--did he talk about growing up and what the town was like when he grew up?
Speaker 2: Well, you know that--the, the good thing about my, my father [Thomas Dortch, Sr.], my mother [Elizabeth Dortch], the adults in our community, one thing that they didn't do then that sometimes it's too often done in the wrong way, here there's a way to teach and a way to educate.  They would not allow me and allow my classmates to grow up thinking that we had to have a crutch to be successful, growing up and letting us use--we knew that racism was all around us.  We knew the, the illnesses of, of those who practiced segregation and practiced, you know, discrimination.  But the one thing about my father, about my mother, about the community leaders, about my teachers, they didn't spend the time trying to build in our minds: see, this is how they're treating you.  They spent more time instilling in us: "You can be anything you wanna be; you can be successful as long as you understand hard work, and dedication, and commitment."  And so while we saw that, it was not one that was a common practice because they took the high road.  I mean we saw the signs "For Colors Only."  But the way they dealt with it was: young man, young lady, you hit those books; you study hard; you treat people fair.  So rather than teaching us hate, they taught us again, and gave us the survival skills to overcome.  It wasn't until we started to see that on television and see the, the marches, and, and the remnants of Jim Crow, and the fire hoses from the police departments, and the dogs, which we started to see, which was really the turning point of a lot of the discrimination around this, this, this country when citizens started to see it, and visualize, and understand just the depths of, of what was happening.  Those in the North and Midwest and other places saw what we were dealing with in the South.  But dad, again, gave us enough to understand the challenges, 'cause they always preached to us you should be thankful for what you have; and when we were younger this happened; and we didn't get to go to school, but you're blessed with the opportunity to go.  All those kinds of reinforcements were there.  Now in the classrooms our teachers taught us even before we had officially African-American History.  Oh, in my case we had African-American History Day.  But the time I graduated we had gotten to Africa-American History Week not the history month.  But our teacher taught us it was a three hundred sixty-five day a year proposition.  But my father, my parents, they didn't indulge in, at least for me, I don't know what they did for my older brother and sisters, but for us they didn't let us get bogged down with thinking I can't succeed, and they won't let me.  Their whole attitude was you've gotta work hard and you will achieve; get your education, and that's what helped us to succeed.

Speaker 1: Now, the, the name Dortch, you say that--what, what is the origin of that name 'cause-
Speaker 2: (Laughter) My aunt, her name is Dru Adams, Drucilla Adams, out of New York, a librarian who's kind of the family history, she went back and researched.  She tracked us back to the seventeen hundreds [1700s] and found that the slave master, whose name was Speedy Dortch, the white slave master we were named after, Speedy Dortch.  And it was amazing; they've done the tree, and given us the information and history.  It was so amazing, even in looking at all the research, when Speedy Dortch died--it was--he had willed land and stuff to his kids.  And he willed property to the slaves, the Dortch slaves.  But he also willed them to his kids.  It was amazing that when we were reading these documents that there was actually land given to the slaves.  But you know, again, that was done in the family tree and all in the research.  And so that was amazing, and they--even to find it in my hometown.  There was a little, little street called Dortch Street.  And you know, the migration and all it was done, but she trek--tracked it back.  So while it sounds German, I don't know about the German part and, and Virginia, but that's as far back as my aunt had gone.  I have to pulled those old documents out and look at him.  But she was able to trace it back to the slave master.
Speaker 1: And Speed--and he wasn't.  It was in Virginia.
Speaker 2: He was in-
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Virginia, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.  Our slave history is a little more, you know, diverse than we were--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, oh yeah.
Story_ID: 58901
Speaker 1: Now, give me your siblings names in the order of-
Speaker 2: Well, my oldest brother who is deceased now almost two years now is John, John Edward.  John is the oldest; and then after John, my sister Juanita, and Juanita of course, so funny.  Juanita was--used to take care of me (unclear)--that was also part of the intelligent system my mom had.  Whenever she wanted to go out they always say well, take Tommy.  And I hear all those stories about how they would try and bribe me.  And as soon as I got back home I told mom everything, which they couldn't go anywhere or couldn't do anything unless they took me--but Juanita, and then there was Marie, and then Carolyn, and then after Carolyn was Richard.  Richard and I are two years apart, and--two years and about three months.  And then I'm the youngest of the six.  That's the order; so had one son, three daughters, then two sons, and it's amazing they saved me for last to be Thomas W. Dortch, Jr.  But that's where we grew up.  When I was in school my brother and my sister, Carolyn, were left because of the difference in age.  We were still in school and spent time together.  I mean, of course, as I was growing--(unclear)--there, but by the time I was old enough to get into real trouble and to go hang out and all of that, we were the ones still left at home, 'cause most of them, surprisingly, my first three members of the family, they moved North to the Newark [New Jersey] area.  They were in Newark and Hempstead, Long Island [New York].  And then as we grew up--Richard and I and Carolyn grew up in the generation together and all that--(unclear)--street.  Also we, we were kind of the second coming.
Story_ID: 58902
Speaker 1: Now are you, are you, are you the baby in many ways, the baby of the family--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Well, it's funny.  Yeah, except my, my son, who is fifteen--he'll be sixteen on April the 7th, five days from my birthday--proclaimed when my mom was telling one of her friends, introducing as that, this is my baby son, Tommy, and my son, who is Thomas W. Dortch, III, he was so--he said no, grandmommy, no grandmommy, he's your youngest son; I'm your baby (laughter).  And so, I'm still gonna always be the baby from the siblings side, but my son has proclaimed he's the baby.  My youngest son is the baby, but I am--I've--and it's amazing when I think about growing up.  They used to always put me up to ask dad for everything.  And, and my youngest sister--it was almost like Carolyn or I would ask, and we always got what we asked.  You know, dad was strict, but it was almo--and then I was--I had the "Mikey" attitude--okay, just tell him to do it.  He go, "Do I go ask dad"--(unclear) fine.  You know, they'd be knocking down the doors trying to get him to do something, and I'd go ask.  I guess he figured okay, I'm the last, so I hadn't learned the discipline the way I should.  So, so that was funny, but mom always knew what time it was.  And even when I went to college, dad used to send me money.  And it's funny; he'd put it in an envelope and give it to mom to mail to me.  She got--she, she got hip to what was going on and stopped.  She sent the note but stopped sending the money.  And, of course, you know, but I look back on that, it's so wonderful, as I tell people.  While I got my degrees from college, the best degree I got came from the best and greatest institution in the land, and that was my family, that the teachers were my parents and my sisters and brothers.  And the degree that I received, which helps me more than any other degree I have, is the degree of commonsense, and I learned that at home.  And I've found that if I use that more than anything else, I can succeed and I can do anything with it, and that came from home.  My, my family was a solid foundation for me.  And growing up, again, as I said, we were sheltered to one extent from all of the ills and the ugliness of, of the time, 'cause I'm a baby boomer, born in 1950.  But we were able to make it through.  Even from growing up when I played, I was student government president and played basketball--and remember going for a basketball tournament, we rode through Forsyth County [Georgia] and remember this sign that said--and it said: "Nigger, don't let the sun set on your behind--on your black behind."  Well, we were on the bus.  You know, we're still young, because you know, our whole attitude: let the sun set now.  But we went through there, but the one thing was, when it got late and got dark we were ready to get out of there.  And we actually went around and came back another way after we played basketball.  But I look at that then, and I look at how in my career, and it's so poetic that my career would later in life when I was with [Senator] Sam Nunn and one of his top advisors when Hosea Williams and the march went to Forsyth County [Georgia] and this became a national issue, and the mayor of Baltimore [Maryland] and all these folks came down, I was in the back room with, with U.S. Senator Sam Nunn and, and all these other dignitaries and the U.S. Justice Department helping to negotiate and helping them find a way to resolve their issue.  And these elected officials were so afraid, and they were worried and did not--many of them didn't have the same attitude as what the citizens did who stoned the marchers.  But I thought back about that.  As a matter of fact, they included it in my book that it's so amazing.  That one county that had that sign when I was growing up as a kid, there I was sitting in that county with Sam Nunn and other national leaders and all, helping them to resolve an issue at that late in life from my days back in the '60's [1960s]; that coming forward to the 1900s--well, I mean coming forward towards late 1988, '89' [1989]--that they still had remnants of that in that county that we were sitting down that really a lot of things have changed since then.  But, but it's amazing how times change and those kinds of experiences take place.
Story_ID: 58903
Speaker 1: Now, Tom, how--what would you--what are, what are some of your earliest memory or your earliest memory of growing up?  Do you--Mr. Dortch, how-
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --How large is Toccoa [Georgia]?  Is it-
Speaker 2: At the time, Toccoa [Georgia] may have had fourteen-sixteen thousand people there.  My growing up in Toccoa--and you know it's funny.  You don't realize how small and hick a town is until you move away from it.  But Toccoa for me--I mean, we had--in the home that we had it's almost like--in this little small town we had a modern home, but in the back we owned all this land.  There was this little creek back there.  And it's funny because the creek separated the African-American community from the white community.  Once you cross the creek on the other side was the white communities.  And growing up, because we were not taught racism, and there's a difference--if you're not taught to discriminate, if you're not taught racism, then your actions are different.  When we were growing up and we played--'cause we had a basketball, a little basketball court.  It was still dirt back in the back that our parents put up for us.  We played basketball; we played football together, the blacks and the white kids.  And if we had fights, it was not blacks against whites; it was one team against the other team.  And that was amazing when I look back and look at the--look at what was happening all around this country.  But it also showed me the power of what can happen when adults don't poison the minds of young people. And that's what we've tried to do with my efforts.  When you're not taught to hate, when you're not taught to discriminate and not to like folks because they look different, you give a young person the opportunity to live life and to understand the spirit that's within, and I had that.  And so that helped me all through life, because I did not have that imprinted on my brain that if you're white your bad, or if you look different from me you're bad.  My parents gave me, planted the seed, again, that you treat all people the same, and when people try to come after you and people try to mistreat you, you don't go after them fighting them head on; you just keep 'em guessing.  And you understand and you learn that, one, nothing is resolved by fighting.  Sometimes, you know, you have to do it.  When we were growing up, I mean, I, I, I used to be with all of my buddies who were not bullies and all, but you know, they, they, they could hold their own.  And I, I regress back to this one incident on the playground.  There was this one bully on--in the school that most folks were afraid of him; even some of my buddies didn't wanna have to tussle with him.  And he decided on the pra--playground one lunch day that he's gonna take me on.  You know, I'm sitting out there.  All the good looking girls out, and all my partners there, and I'm playing basketball.  So you know, this is my first year on the basketball team.  So this guy came after me, and it was survival, and I whipped his butt.  He was never a bully again in the high school.  Nobody else messed with me, but I didn't take the attitude I can go beat up anybody.  But the one--
Story_ID: 58904
Speaker 1: I, I dealt with it.  I, I, I used nonviolence as long as I could, but this is a situation--you know, being a young brother and the, and the--you know, like you said, the young ladies there on the playground, I couldn't do that.  And then my buddies, you know, who knows who'd come after me after that, so I, I whipped him up pretty bad.  I never had another problem.  But the good thing was after that happened he stopped because he was exposed.  But, but the other thing--he became a good friend of mine; we played basketball and all together later.  But, but with all of that I just think back to the foundation that I got from, from family, and it, it's amazing when I look at the kinds of challenges we had then and look at how we handled those.  I mean there were no knives; there were no guns, not even sticks.  If you couldn't--first--the first option was the wolf line.  If you could talk a good game, that solved it.  And, and for us that was it.  And then after the wolf, if it didn't work, you got in each other's face.  And then the (unclear) was okay, we go fisticuff.  And I look at that back then and, and what a difference it made back then.  But the one thing that worked for me and worked for my generation was adult involvement.  It was being clear and a clear message.  I even remember, too, the principal had that little leather strap in the office back when corporal punishment was allowed.  We all made up our mind we were not going into the principal's office, man.  But I look at what worked for us as a generation and really how I got my core values and the foundation that helped me today, even the stupid stuff.  When we--in the segregated city--and I included that in my book--they put us in the upper balcony.  Blacks were in the upper balcony.  The white citizens were in the lower balcony.  And we're sitting there saying isn't this stupid.  We can throw sodas over a balcony.  We can throw popcorn out here.  But that was just the time, and that was the way life was then.  But we didn't let the fact that we were up here watching the movies make any difference from not being downstairs.  The one thing I did learn though later in life under the economic side of it, you know, I will never pay.  And I teach our kids, you don't pay and reinforce bad behavior.  You don't go spend your money where people don't want you.  I take the same attitude today, and I learned that then.  I don't have to live in a neighborhood where people don't want me.  The, the way for me to do it is to build my neighborhood.  When I moved out of--from a block from [HM] [Representative] John Lewis and could have gone anywhere in this city [Atlanta, Georgia] or the metro area if I were looking to stay in this area, I could have built my home anywhere I wanted to.  I built it in Southwest Atlanta [Georgia], because my attitude is you have to build your own neighborhood.  I believed in the folks.  When I look around and see a Hank Aaron in my neighborhood, who's living there, and Andy [HM] [Andrew] Young, who lives right around the corner, and his brother, and [HM] [Representative] John Lewis, and [HM] Ingrid Saunders Jones in the neighborhood, and I look at all of these folks and [HM] Xernona Clayton and everybody who's there, it sent the message to me.  Just as my village at home worked for me, my village here in Atlanta [Georgia] can work for me by simply casting my lot and building my own community.  And so when we started our first neighborhood investment we put a gourmet coffee shop in our community.  And, and when people start moving to Sandy Springs [Georgia], they have the right; If they wanna go to Buckhead [Georgia], they have the right.  But my attitude is I'm gonna stay so the young black kids can see successful African Americans in their neighborhood, driving in and out from their homes in the neighborhood, involved in the schools, and being there.  That's what I learned from my days of growing up.  And I can't blame anything on anybody else if I'm not willing to be there and make a difference.  And that's the upbringing and the foundation from my parents and my neighborhood that helped me to understand and get to where I am today.  The other thing was this whole piece, as I said, I had the courage to deal with the big bully on the campus.  My parents taught me to always walk tall and be proud, and I don't bend, and I don't take a backseat to anybody when I know they're wrong or the issue's wrong.  I mean I've been in the press quite a bit, even lately, even though the [Atlanta Journal] Constitution in general decided to distort the facts.  But the issue is, just as my parents also taught me a value, that you're a friend, you're a friend.  And if a friend's in trouble, that's when they need you the most; can't be a fair-weather friend.  There's no such thing as friendship if you're fair weather.  And so that foundation that I got has allowed me to be a real friend.  And as I--I've always understood I am accountable for myself.  And as long as I know within my mind and in my heart that I've always done the right thing and what is, is best, it doesn't matter what people say about me as long as I know.  And that's the thing, back to the old upbringing where they say--used to say it's not what they call you; it's what you answer to.  And those kinds of, of foundations and the kind of upbringing has allowed me to move through life to do the kinds of things that I've done.  And it all starts back at home, and it starts back where I had the commun--the whole community base of support, something that's missing quite a bit today in our society.
Story_ID: 58905
Speaker 1: Now I wanna go back to your community.  And I, I would like you to sort of take yourself back and, and talk about what sights, smells, and sounds really remind you of growing up.
Speaker 2: Fresh air.  It's, it's a small city; it was then and still, while it's moved and has a good industrial base.  I spent time out in the woods 'cause me and my buddies would go run, and explore, and hang, and we fished, loved to fish; It was so good for me.  At age five, my uncle, my next door neighbor--but my uncle used to take me fishing.  As a matter of fact, I tell people growing up then my uncle's probably the reason why I'm such a big fundraiser and why I'm able to raise the kind of money, the million that I do.  My used to get on him.  My uncle used to hold out a nickel and say okay, "Tommy, you want this nickel, you ask for it.  Come on now, you beg for this."  And I'd do it and he'd give it to me.  So, you know, that worked well.  As a matter, it helped me to maneuver with my parents.  And my dad--but it was funny.  With all of that, it was out of doors; it was a wonderful community, small, a Dairy Queen, you know.  It was a big restaurant, and you're there--didn't have that many fast food restaurants.  We all considered ourselves the "Dapper Dans".  I gotta find some of those photos of me that--my son laughs at me 'cause I had the--when I left high school, it was funny.  I had the short haircut almost to the, to the head.  When I left college, I had the big fro, doing my thing with the--you know, we went through those things.  But when I look back, Toccoa [Georgia] was just a nice safety zone for me.  The barbershop--when we'd go in the barbershop where the adults--I mean I really--I look at that and the, and the elders in their playing checkers.  And you listen at all the wolf lines, and these young people, you know, you soak it up like a sponge.  But later on when you repeat it and you repeat it, you begin to understand the meaning of it.  Like the old thing, "You make your bed hard, you gotta sleep in it."  An, "Every dog know it's bone, and every dog's got his day."  Those things for me were exposures that today I try to emulate that, because young kids, for us, our heroes--we didn't have the superstars; we didn't have the big, big business owners.  And the minister wasn't the televangelist, and the teachers were our heroes and the principal.  But they were accessible to us, and that made a difference in my life because I saw people.  And people I wanted to emulate were there for me to talk to.  I could touch them; I could see them.  And so that meant a lot to me.  And growing up in Toccoa [Georgia], I mean, it, it's just amazing that the city was, I mean, a little town where you don't have all the hustle and bustle; you could walk anywhere.  And so all that was good.  And of course we had the beautiful girls.  You know, you--and there's one of the things as a young kid you always wanted to impress them of course.  The thing back then it was just simply a matter of hoping one day you'll just kiss him (laughter).  I mean you think about the little childhood things, but it was a normal life where no matter what the economic status of any family, you were all treated the same; you were all one; we all lived in the neighborhood together.  And so for me, that Toccoa [Georgia] is a Toccoa that I love.  It's a memory I have.  I've taken my children back to make sure they understand, and they see, and can appreciate that.  And that's why even today for me to go to--I mean I love deep sea fishing, but one of the most special times for me is to go freshwater fishing with my son; I love it.  I mean because it gives me kind of, of a chance to reminiscent about how I grew up.  And one of the things I've decided this year, even though I've been running everywhere, I'm gonna take the time to make sure my son and I get to do that fishing, 'cause it's a chance to really be in your own world, to relax and enjoy.  And I know what it meant to me.  Back then I never did hunting, because I didn't care for hunting.  It was too many crazy people out with guns.  And my parents kept us away from guns, and, and I'm happy they did.  And that's why even with my son I never bought him play toys, play guns, you know, because I didn't want to and never allowed him to be brought into my home in terms of gifts, because I understand the difference when you set the foundation.  But Toccoa [Georgia], even when, even when we were segregated, the white community that knew my--those that knew my father and knew my mother respected, respected us.  They always tracked what we did, I mean, and would always try to check up on me.  'Cause the other thing was--the good part, which gets back to foundation--yeah, I got a lot of little write-ups about this, that, and the other.  My parents never let that--let me let it go to my head, and that was good.  And for me it really was a good feeling to make my parents proud, a good feeling to make my sisters and brother proud--but to go on about my business and grow up being the kid when I needed to be and going on and, and, and following my dreams.  And so that was the, the Toccoa [Georgia] that really was a safe haven, a real, real village where the adults really wrapped arms around all of us.
Story_ID: 58906
Speaker 1: Now you said there were--so there were like fourteen hundred blacks in this town.  You said it was about-
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: Ten percent.
Speaker 2: Yeah, somewhere maybe fourteen hundred, understanding that's the city and the county.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Stevens County, Toccoa, Georgia.  But as far as--you know, there were no boundary lines.  I mean if you lived in Stevens County, you still came to school in Whitman Street, 'cause it was the only black school, and we were still segregated.
Speaker 1: So the street--the school was Whitman, your elementary-
Speaker 2: It was called Whitman Street, the elementary and high school.  There were no middle schools back then.  You came in in first grade, and you went all the way through.
Speaker 1: And do you, do you remember some of the teachers that were--I know your-
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Your cousin was--you said-
Speaker 2: My cousin, Willie Mae Keels, was my homeroom teacher.  And Willie Mae, she--her--it's, it's funny 'cause her husband, Sylvester, was one of the original members of James Brown band.  As I said, my first cousin, Bobby Byrd, was one of the original [James Brown's] Flames, wrote the--he and a guy named Baby Lloyd wrote the first two songs that James Brown recorded.  But in high school there was Mrs. Woodruff, who was my math teacher.  Mrs. McIntyre was my second grade teacher.  I remember her 'cause she used to have a little ruler.  And in the class if you messed up, she'll rap you on your knuckles.  Mrs. Henderson was my first grade teacher--Mrs. Henderson, Betty Henderson--I cried when I--I remembered so vividly the day.  When I had to move from her classroom to go to the second grade I didn't wanna leave.  Mrs. Henderson was--I mean this lady I was just I, I, I was just crazy about and loved because she was just like, you know, an extension of my mother who cared, and nurtured, and made sure we learned.  Then Mrs. McIntyre, I remembered her because she's also a disciplinarian, but I learned in her class.  And then as we moved up, I remember all of those, those teachers.  And in my high school, in my school period, and even in high school, we always got the hand-me-down books, and the books would be tattered.  We'd have desks that would be marked up.  You'd read all these names and those hearts from the others.  But the one thing about the teachers in my school, they never let us feel that because that page was torn, and the books were tattered, and the desks were old and marked up that that was excuse not to learn.  And because we didn't have the best equipment in our chemistry classes, these teachers came prepared to make--do makeshift equipment, and we learned.  And here I am today, a successful African-American man because my foundation started with teachers who came to teach, and who cared, and who loved and would not let us use any excuses for not succeeding.  And, and, and I look back and then I look at it now.  Sure our kids get new books; they get new desks.  But we've gotta understand is you gotta go back to the real basics, having folks in the classroom who care, who love, and parents who take an active role but also the discipline that must start at home.  And you gotta have a way to continue in school because if you can have a child focused, they can learn.  We believe and I believe every child can learn.  They demonstrate that from their actions, whether it's singing all the top songs--they know those lyrics, whether it's knowing who did what on the soaps or knowing all of the rappers and all of this and what they did.  If our young folks can comprehend those kind of things, they can learn anything.  And that's the attitude that I take.  It worked then; it will work now, but it's the whole village that must come together.
Story_ID: 58907
Speaker 1: And so when I look at my experiences, and look at school, and look at my teachers, I, I had teachers--I remember my French teacher.  He was from Chicago [Illinois].  He did the best he could to teach me French, and I learned, you know, when I went to college.  As a matter of fact, my teacher in college is a young--we broke her in, as we said.  She was just a young teacher getting us.  She was only--Barbara Palmer may have been--I guess Barbara was probably twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four, fresh out of college coming to teaching us French, and we challenged her. But the--or learned so much from her, if I look back at the, the people I had--and I remember the principal we had from Chicago [Illinois] who made us so proud when he stood in the middle of the streets on this day--and it was my junior year in high school--and stood out there and told 'em: "Don't you bring those damn trucks in here.  I ordered new desks, and you will deliver new desks and equipment to my kids."  And my junior [year] was the first year I had a principal to stand up and say you won't do that to my kids.  And we got the new equipment we ordered.  He wasn't there the next year, but it sent a message to me too.  You have to stand up for what is right.  And so I learned from that.  And my principal, G. J. Lee was the principal of my senior class--I mean I graduated my senior year, who's here now, a good friend and fraternity brother and all.  But I remember all of them.  But G. J. Lee was my chemistry professor, who, for me, was a magician who could make these little equipped pieces of equipment to teach us chemistry, and I learned from him.  And so, yeah, I look back at my teachers, and the one reason why I went to Fort Valley [State University, Georgia]--the majority of teachers came from Fort Valley State University, at the time State College, which at that time almost sixty percent of all of the African-American teachers in Georgia came from Fort Valley and forty percent of all of the principals.  But I followed that, even though I had offers, and people wanted me to come and play basketball.  You know, this school wanted me to come because of my academics, and my teachers came from down there.  And, and so all of that played a very important role.  But it feeds into the whole theme that we use in 100 Black Men: "What they see is what they'll be."  So positive adults reinforcing in my mind and in their actions that I could be whatever I want and that there people all around me that wanted to see me succeed and wanted to see my friends succeed; didn't matter that my dad was in business, and my mom was well respected.  I was still a child in the community.  Yeah, I was Tom [Thomas Dortch, Sr.]'s boy, but so was the same as that Sam's boy or, or that's Billy's boy, but we were all the children, and they looked out for us.  So that--growing up for me in that small town was one of the best foundations that I could have had.  And it really helped me to succeed to what I've been able to do but also helped me to continue to carry the message and continue the legacy.
Story_ID: 58908
Speaker 1: Now the other thing I have a question about is what--'cause you seem to--you're very verbal.  So I was wondering-you're very, you're very--you're very verbal.  I mean--but no, good, in a good way.  I don't mean that in a negative way, no.  But I--you also said you were math whiz, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so I'm wondering if you--I mean were you a good student all the way around?  Is--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Yeah.  In, in, high school [Whitman Street High School] I was all A--all A's.  I made all A's in high school.  I played in the band; I played basketball; I was Student Government President for two years, my junior and senior year.  But back then it wasn't the class system.  It was a case of, okay, if you can do it, you can demonstrate it if you're there.  So it was like, what are your talents?  Show them.  I mean--and, and that was it.  I sang in the choir.  I, I sung in my church choir.  I mean the other good thing about my family that I think was a great foundation, you got up on Sunday morning and you went, you went to Sunday school, and you went to church.  And it didn't matter which church, 'cause my dad was a Methodist; my mom was a Baptist.  Now you can pick or choose, but you're going to church.  And there was a lot to be said about spirituality and that foundation.  Sure, there were hypocrites in the church then as you got 'em in the church now, but the overall theme was spirituality and believing in the Supreme Being.  And of course, I survived the days of the blond haired, blue eyed Jesus pictures on the wall.  But I've searched and I've found the real truth.  But it doesn't matter what that image was on the wall, it was still all about the Supreme Being.  And that also helped to contribute to my foundation.  But I look at all the factors and looking at ver--I'm very verbal because my--growing up in a segregated school system, nobody ever tried to, to diminish your value.  Nobody ever tried to shut you up.  Nobody ignored you growing up in those schools.  They tried to pull it out of you.  You couldn't be a student in the classroom and sit around and say nothing.  Those teachers call you out, and so you had to do your homework.  You had to be prepared, and they pushed you.  And then going from there to a historically black college [Fort Valley State University, Georgia], you know, it was not a back row seat.  It was like, bring all you got.  Let me see what you have; you can do better than that.  It's never okay, that's a good grade.  You know, you can do better than that.  That reinforcement and encouragement kind of brings it out in you, 'cause I know going from Fort Valley when I was at Ford Fellow[ship] at Georgia State University--one, leaving high school, going through college, student Government President at Fort Valley, coming to Georgia State a Ford Fellow, and I get in the classroom, and it was a matter of being suppressed.  I mean you know the answer, and the teacher looking dead at you and over--overlooks you.  But had it not been for the foundation, and if that was my first experience, I probably would have been one that sits in the back of the room, say nothing, do nothing, go along to get along to get you grade.  But that's not the way they taught me, not the way they taught me and my family, not the way they taught me in my school, not the way they taught me in my community, and certainly not the way they taught me at Fort Valley State University.  These institutions gave me the "I can do and I can be" attitude.  And that's why I tell every child that I, that I can get within the sound of my voice, "If you believe you can, you can.  And if you believe you can't, you can't.  It's a matter of what you believe, but you gotta believe in yourself."  And that's what I've tried to do in all the organizations, to instill self confidence, instill the kind of, of believing in yourself.  And that's what made it for me.  So, yeah, I--the people say, "Well, you should be a minister" (laughter).  I said "Hey, I--you know, it ain't about being a minister.  I'm gonna stand up and be man."  And, and it's the way that I was taught to be, that you don't take a back row seat if you believe and see something's wrong.  And that's what is so important today, getting people to stand up when they know somebody's gotta stand up and speak out and not taking a back row seat, but there's a way to do it.  And I've been able to do the things that I've done in life and change things and environments because I know the professional way.  And then as I say, I know how to get down in the street too.  But I've learned to be a negotiator.  I've learned to finesse situations.  That's all part of the growing up process.
Story_ID: 58909
Speaker 1: And then I had some great mentors, from [HM] Julian Bond, and Ben Brown, and [HM] [Representative] John Lewis, and Lonnie King, and, and the late Jondelle Johnson, and, and all those folks, and Andy [HM] [Andrew] Young.  I had a short stint as an intern in Andy's off--office.  So these people helped me--Judge Horace Ward.  But I was also one who was always actively involved.  I understood back at home when I got to pass out leaflets that dad and them had me doing; when I got to college and got involved with the upperclassman on issues, including when we were boycotting the restaurant in the campus, 'cause everybody was complaining about the bad food; to the fact that we had instructors you couldn't understand 'cause you had foreign instructors trying to teach English and all.  You couldn't--and it wasn't discrimination.  You just couldn't tell what they were saying.  We were saying how can you have someone teaching when there's a, a communication barrier.  We got involved in that.  And then the other thing, you know, I was just a little stupid freshman then when the upperclassman were pro--protesting that, that upper class women couldn't stay out past ten o'clock.  I didn't understand what the deal was, but I just figured (unclear) you're down here.  They ought to be able to stay out past ten in the curfew, so we got involved.  But all of that contributed to me being one who's very vocal, who is very confident, and, and myself very confident that I can achieve anything.  And my attitude--and I tell everybody--I will give out before I give up.  And so that's helped me to, to be and, and to get where I am today.  And I'm trying to instill it in my kids.  When I say my kids, not only my own children, personal blood children, but to the one hundred thousand plus young people in our organization, and the 100 Black Men, in the college students that I work with through the National Black College Alumni Hall of Fame, and, and, and all the organizations I work with.  I believe that young people should have the attitude and should come out and be very positive about themselves and believe that they can do and be anything that they wanna be.  It's worked for me; it's a formula that's worked for so many people.  And there's no reason that here in 2002 it won't work for the young people of today.
Story_ID: 58910
Speaker 1: Now was there--when you--are your--you know, your graduation from high school, was there any thought about where you were going, or was there any, you know--I mean I knew why you wounded up going there-
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --But was, was there a, a lot of discussion about that, or should you go, or you know?
Speaker 2: What?  Yo, first of all, I had a lot of teachers who influenced me.  And by the time I was in my junior year, even though my new high school basketball coach was from Florida A and M [Florida Agriculture and Mechanical University], Boatwright, who was a young, young whippersnapper, fresh out of college, Boatwright was, was, you know, again, a young contemporary that we could relate to.  But I don't care if Boatwright came from FAMU [Florida Agriculture and Mechanical University].  I had decided by then I'm going to Fort Valley [State University].  All my teachers--when I graduated from high school and getting ready to go, I wanted to be a math teacher like Mrs. Woodruff.  Mrs. Woodruff, I mean, taught me, and math I wasn't afraid of it.  And I wanted to be a math teacher, and so going from there to college, I--my attitude is I'm gonna go down here and major in math, and I'm gonna be a teacher.  And see, from my day, being a teacher was a very proud career.  And it's something that we need to bring back today, 'cause I tell young people--I just spoke to all the SGA [Student Government Association] presidents and officers for the Atlanta Public Schools last week--if it wasn't for a teacher, I wouldn't be where I am today, because teachers gave me my foundation in high school and elementary school, worked with me in college, worked with me in grad school, and worked with me.  And those who were not formal teachers in the classroom taught me.  And we gotta get back to where people get in the classroom and teach for the love of teaching, and it's not just their job.  And there are a lot of teachers who are out there because of that.  So I was ready to go be a teacher, because for me in that neighborhood these were my heroes; these were the leaders.  And so that's what I wanted to be when I was leaving high school; I was gonna go be a teacher.  And, and again, it is a very proud profession, and it's something that we have all got to join in to bring it back to the level in the eyes of folks what it is, because, again, without 'em, you can't have 'em.  And I made more money than every teacher I had in high school on my first job when I graduated from college, and that's not right; shouldn't have been that way.
Story_ID: 58911
Speaker 1: Now basketball, you were--were you the basketball star?  Oh, wait--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA BY MALE VOICE):  One minute.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't the star.  My dad [Thomas Dortch, Sr.] was a basketball star.  I didn't know that.  He never pushed me, never--'cause dad knew 'em as a businessman, the man who makes the deals.  I didn't know that until later, because dad didn't push it, and they didn't want the pressure on me.  And everybody used to say, "Well, you know, you need pu--you should play like Tom."  Well, the good thing about my junior and senior year, the coaches we had had us in teams.  We had a couple of guys who were really stars, but the way we ran, we had two squads.  When one squad come in and hit you, the next one come, then the next one.  By the fourth quarter we had tired you out, and we had a perfect record my senior year.  We only lost one game my junior year.  So in basketball I was a forward, but I had a team.  And I was a starter for my team on the second squad, but we had equal time.  And then when we got in the tournaments and got in trouble, you know, we all got mixed and matched.  As a matter of fact, I remember my senior year in a regional tournament.  (Laughter) Most of the guys had fouled out, and so it was me and a guy named Dwayne Giles.  And that year I had scored my career high in, in points, and in rebounds, and, and played the defense to the point that it was not about the clock.  It was we gonna play it until this game is won.  And so I got that, but, but I made the East-West All-Star team my senior year in, in high school.  But for me it was fun to hang with my buddies.
Speaker 1: Okay, we're-
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  We're done.
Story_ID: 58912
Speaker 1: --They sent the Statute of Liberty as their apology to this nation for their involvement in slavery.  Nobody talks about that.  And I tell people I don't go to picnics.  I go to cookouts.  I go to cookouts.  'Cause if you knew the history, and if you go to the Library of Congress, picnics was social outings where people picked the nigger, as they said, and hung 'em as part of the entertainment.  But I don't use that to make folks angry.  I said "You have to understand the history, and where we've been, and how we've come"--and even to the issue when I talk about terrorism.  Terrorism didn't start on 9-1-1 [September 11, 2001].  Timothy McVeigh was a terrorist.  And, and terrorism takes place every day when our kids wake up in these at-risk communities trying to go from their homes to their school for fear of rape and being abused; that's terrorism; that's domestic terrorism.  And then the issue of--the anthrax didn't start abroad; it started here.  I mean, so when we start to deal with all of these issues, getting people to put 'em in their proper prospective--and that, that while I grieve for almost three thousand on 9-1-1 [September 11, 2001], the hundreds of thousand--well, really there are millions of people who live in fear and in terror every day in this nation.  And there are no efforts of support, and Congress just raised the compensation to one point eight [1.8] million per family.  Some of these families won't even get a penny who live in terror every day.  The kids who could be the discoverers of a cure for cancer or AIDS will die or will never fulfill their potential because they don't have a support system.  So these are the kinds of things that, that I look at and I try to get folks to folks to focus on.  But I had a good time at Auburn, and they may invite me back (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's great.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 58913
Speaker 1: Now when you--what's--I just wanna ask you one more thing with basketball.  What do you think it taught you, you know, sports and-
Speaker 2: Well, sports for me taught me teamwork.  It taught me preparation; it taught me endurance; it taught me how to be humble; it taught me how to relax; it taught me the value of good health.  It taught me discipline.  And so all of those things were just part of my growth process.  And, and so if, if young people today--I mean I look at that and I, I still say like the, the example--and I said we were all--when black and white kids played ball in my backyard and we got along, it wasn't about the color of the people on the team.  It was about us playing as a team with one goal, to win.  And we did that, and we did that together.  And we never one time thought about what was the color of the, of the other person.  If you proved that you could shoot, you're the go-to person.  If you could jump, we depended on you to rebound, I mean, or to block the shots.  And that's the, the kind of scenario I use today with young people.  If we can go play ball--basketball--together on the courts as a team and look to each one not as the black kid, but that's the person you can depend on to score, or on the football field, or on the baseball diamond, and we do that.  If we can do all of that, and that's for girls and, and boys, why do we have to go through all these gyrations to separate ourselves for, for no nonsense.  It's those--the sickness and the illness that adults have passed on to kids.  That's why your--with, with the Black-Jewish Coalition here [Atlanta, Georgia], and we do what can call a weekend of understanding where we bring young kids, black and Jewish, from high schools and paired them up for the weekend.  And we have exercises like everything I always wanted to ask about African Americans but was afraid to ask; everything I always wanted to ask about Jews but was afraid to ask.  And when they start the dialogue, they find out the differences are very minimal; and look at how our past and how we fought together; and how the Civil Rights gains opened up more doors for Jewish folks; and how Jews, when they came in here, the kinds of challenges they had to succeed; and we look back at what Irish and other immigrants went through, our paths aren't that different.  And clearly understanding, as we tell them, our goals and desires aren't that different.  Parents want their kids to succeed and to be better off than what they were.  So all of those play into being people that you are.  My parents never said, "Tommy, I want you to be a doctor, lawyer, or teacher."  They just wanted me to be a decent person.  And I've taken that and passed it on to my kids.  I tell 'em there are a lot of things I hope you will do with your life, but all I want you to do is to grow up and be a decent individual.  If you choose not to go to college, that's fine.  If you want to waste that talent that you have, or if you don't want to fulfill that potential, I can't make you do that.  I can't make you go get a good job, but I want you to be able to provide for yourself; provide, provide for your family.  But more importantly, I want people to know you as a decent person.  And even today, with all that I do, I still feel and, and I'm happy because my parents taught me most folks that you're gonna run into are gonna always say that Tommy Dortch is a decent person; Tommy Dortch is committed; Tommy Dortch believes in people, because that's more important to me than oh, Tommy Dortch has the potential to be a millionaire; Tommy Dortch owns this, and Tommy Dortch is the national head of that.  That's good.  I like the potential for those, but that ain't what drives me and what it's all about.  When I die I want my kids to be proud of what I've done.  I wanna leave a legacy that when I die because of the color of my kids' skin, because he's a young black male, he's not gonna have all of these roadblocks and barriers because of the color of his skin.  And my daughter is gonna have these roadblocks and my grandchildren because of the color of their skin.  I want them to be able--just as Dr. [Martin Luther] King really laid it out.  I want them to be judged based on themselves and the--and their wholeness not based on their color; not based on what community, because by the same token, I don't want my son to have a, a easy ride in life because he's my son.  I want him to understand work ethic, but I don't anybody to mess with him.  I tell folks the quickest way to make me a criminal is mess with my children.  I will go to jail, and I'll give my life for my children.  But by the same token, I want my children to be decent individuals, because that's what I was taught by my parents, and my family, and my neighborhood.  That's the important thing for me.  And if you teach them that and teach them commonsense, they're gonna fulfill whatever potential they want in life.
Story_ID: 58914
Speaker 1: You know, when you got to Fort Valley [State University, Georgia], were there some surprises there?  I mean you couldn't--went thinking you wanted to be a math teacher.  Were there other--(unclear)-
Speaker 2: When I got to Fort Valley [State University, Georgia], first of all I'll tell you, coming from [Whitman Street] high school [Toccoa, Georgia], the first thing that I  had heard from all of my, my brothers and his buddies--boy, some good looking women.  Let me tell you, Fort Valley [State University] down in South Georgia in Peach County had some of the best looking women I'd ever seen in life.  Coming from a little small town, we had some good looking girls, but not in the numbers--so, so I guess every, every young brother going in--and kind of like the sisters going to a campus--she looked--you say yeah, "I'm gonna like it here."  The other good thing for me was my brother was there, so I had the support base, 'cause my brother was a soph--ended his--had ended his sophomore year when I got there as a freshman, so I had him.  I had all of his buddies, so I had another support system.  I had a Vice President for Student Affairs, Dr. Ozias Pearson, who was just like an extended parent.  He checked on you--said "No, they, they don't need to come down here with cars or none of that other stuff."  But we had people who--and it was amazing.  When I came on campus, Dr. W. W. E. Blanchet, was the president [1966-1973].  And for him--and I never knew how it--when he saw me, and he said: "How you doing, Mr. Dortch," that was the greatest day of my life, coming to that campus, had the president of the college know who I was.  But that was the kind of leadership--it was a small campus.  And when you got there, they all had done there little homework.  I would play [basketball] there.  As a matter of fact, when I played in East-West All-Star Game, we played on the campus of Fort Valley State University.  But for me to come there, it was small environment, all these beautiful young ladies, but then there were a lot of folks from around my hometown that like when the cities where I played basketball, several of them ended up at Fort Valley [State University, Georgia].  So, and then from my hometown some of the students came down, so I had a good support system.  And then a lot of the teachers I had in high school already said, "Look, we're sending you," 'cause they recruited.  They recruited you heavy.  They'll say you ought to go to Fort Valley [State University].  So, for me, going there--and then I was a scholarship recipient.  So going to Fort Valley [State University, Georgia] was good.  It was like another home away from home.
Story_ID: 58915
Speaker 1: Okay, and when you--were--but did you--for those four years were you still thinking--were you still thinking of being a math teacher?  When did that change?
Speaker 2: Well, let me tell you, they didn't -- change on math, 'cause I had said "Okay, I might go out for the basketball team."  I accepted an academic scholarship.  But, you know, going down there, having played in East-West All-Star and, and all and met some of the folks, I was saying I may go out and go out for basketball but got down there I jumped right--when you--going as a pure math major, I jumped right into my major.  So I had lab; I had all of these--I mean, going from high school to college, it's a whole new--it was a whole new game for me.  So I'm in there studying and in lab and all of that.  Now all my buddies are out having fun and getting to go to the parties and going to the games, and you're back there studying.  And I said I don't think this is what college is supposed to be.  So I, I went through it for a while; I stuck it out.  I was in, in Algebra by the second quarter, 'cause we were on a quarter system.  I'm, I'm in--and all these upperclassmen in the classmen in the classroom with me.  And I said this is not quite working, and so I changed my math--my, my major from pure math to sociology and took a minor in pure math--still got into it, 'cause the other good thing was that the teachers I ran into--'cause from the core courses you get to learn teachers and their style and technique and--but it was still small enough for you to really have teachers who cared.  And, and the other thing that I liked about Fort Valley [State University], I had a lot of younger teachers who were there, which, you know, you come in thinking you're gonna challenge 'em.  You wanna make sure they know what they, they know.  But also they had a new and fresh technique for teaching, and they would challenge you.  And that, for me, just like my son, I love a challenge.  You know, I'm gonna do my homework, and I'm coming prepared, 'cause I wanna make sure you're prepared.  But that was--again, we were encouraged in high school.  Come prepared, and if you believed in what you--in your answers, you defend the--them.  And it was a safe environment.  And then when I got there, because my brother was there--they called him Dortch.  So Richard [Dortch] was already settled in, and big Dortch's brother was the way you were introduced.  And you got the hang with the upperclassmen.  And so for me, I just got brought into everything.  Gordon Drennan, who was one of my brother's closest friends, was a--he was the treasurer for the Student Government Association.  He was an accountant--majoring in accounting, so they kind of got me involved in--'cause they always had a freshman officer and all.  So I got, I got right into the thick of things coming in and having been in that environment coming from high school, a little small town, I kind of just blended right on into it and was just good to go.  And, and it was great to be there and to go to footballs games, 'cause we didn't have a football team in my school 'cause, you know, they had the football team.  There, there were two white high schools and then our segregated school.  So I got a chance to go--football, and we were--Fort Valley [State University] had a stick, as we called it.  We had a, we had a football team that could, could go.  And we always battled out with Tuskegee [University, Alabama] for the championship.  And then to have the basketball and then to just be there on that campus was something.  And look at the fact that Horace Mann Bond, [HM] Julian Bond's father, was the first president [Fort Valley State University, Georgia, 1939-1945].  And then Lena Horne had gone to school there, and, and you look at C. V. [Cornelius V.] Troup [second President Fort Valley State University, Georgia, 1945-1966], the rich history from that school, it was--for me it was like this is revel--rev--revelation.  This is an opportunity to move to the next level in life.  And the same thing, they always enforced and reinforced you can achieve, and they never, never let you sit down and be lazy.  And so Fort Valley [State University, Georgia] was a good next step for me.
Story_ID: 58916
Speaker 1: And then, so what were your thoughts that you were gonna do when you graduated?
Speaker 2: Well, I got--when I got into my freshman year, in terms of working with upperclassmen, I continued that on.  And I was very proactive about getting involved.  And then at the end of my junior year, folks came in and said look, you need to run for Student Government President.  And I thought about it, cause I'd helped to bring--even though I pledge Omega [Omega Psi Phi fraternity], I'd helped to bring a service organization on campus.  And, and we were very involved in doing a lot of things in the community and, and movement.  And, and so I said okay, I might try it.  And so we put together our whole little strategy.  And you know, having been a veteran from my father's [Thomas Dortch, Sr.] days and how they did the campaigning, we got together and the night before the election--first, I selected, selected the right team.  I picked--at that time the Kappas [Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity] were pretty strong on campus.  Omegas [Omega Psi Phi] and the Alphas [Alpha Phi Alpha] were battling it out, so I figured--you know, I had an Omega [Omega Psi Phi] candidate and an Alpha [Alpha Psi Phi] candidate running against me, so I picked the Kappa.  So I figured 'cause the Omegas and the Alphas--'cause I didn't finish my pledging then, but I figured they were gonna negate each other.  I put a Kappa [Kappa Alpha Psi] on as my vice president, picked Peggy, who was not a, not a member of any frater--any sorority.  So Peggy brought my "None-Phi-Nones" [Omega Psi Phi], as we called it.  And then Truman Williams, who was a veteran from--who was a marine but came to school late, would pull my mature candidates, and he also would pull all of the macho guys.  So I had a heck of a team.  And so we campaigned the night before the election of Student Government.  We gave this big party, 'cause I moved off campus after my second quarter.  We always rented.  My brother [Richard Dortch] and all of us moved in.  So we were--had this nice little apartment complex.  And in our backyard we through a big party.  We had the "Booms Farm" and the "Ripple", and we used to buy the grain alcohol.  You put them big tubs, and the folks came and partied the night before.  The next day we won by a landslide, I mean.  And so the next thing that we did was had a retreat.  And when I came in, the one thing I followed along was I decided I was gonna have a whole new agenda for Student Government.  We were gonna have these meetings.  We were gonna get involved in voter registration and voter turnout.  And so we started that, and we did so well that we registered over ninety percent of the students on campus.  But what we did when the first election came around, we supported local citizen.  No student ran.  We helped to elect the major of the city [Fort Valley, Georgia] council as African Americans.  The Utilities Commission that controlled the money was majority African American.  We didn't push anybody for mayor, but the word got out, and people got nervous 'cause there were county elections coming.  But we had gotten registered to the point that folks started opposing, trying to say that students shouldn't be able to vote in cities where they attend college.  And so they even challenged that, and our Attorney General, Ben [Benjamin W.] Fortson [Jr.], and those--Secretary of State [of Georgia] Ben [Benjamin W.] Fortson [Jr.] and those came back.  And they all ruled that students could vote in cities where they attend college, 'cause they met the residency require and--requirement.  So we got all of those things, and we were rolling, and we had agendas.  We brought concerts.  In the past, there was this one big concert.  We brought a concert per quarter, but we tried to get students to come, and they wouldn't come to the meetings.  And so we had all kind of strategies.  I sent a letter up to every students saying we're not doing anymore concerts on the Lyceum--that's where you brought in speakers--until the students met.  And then I went to Truman Williams, who, who was a good friend.  And Truman and--got a lot of the big burly football players, 'cause we were gonna have this big showdown after I sent that notice out.  And we said and we're not doing another one, another concert, till the students come to the meeting.  And I know they were gonna be rowdy, so I had all my big boys and my team from the football in there.  They were my little sergeant at arms, and they came in raising sand.  But the football team was so popular, we packed the Student Center that night.  And I just remembered--now that I remembered back from the college [Fort Valley State University, Georgia].  And I had my boys there for anybody that got out of line, and they were raising sand.  I said but look, the Student Government can do whatever they want.  We don't have to give one concert.  And we got into the agenda.  And when these guys were reinforcing, students finally settled down.  They understood the plan, and we went on to have one of the most successful years.  As a matter of fact, [HM] Julian [Bond], and Ben [Brown] and those, when they started seeing all the things that we were doing, [HM] Julian Bond, and [HM] [Representative] John Lewis, and those, they came Fort Valley [State University].  I had [HM] Julian [Bond] to speak to all of them.
Story_ID: 58917
Speaker 1: And they came to me, 'cause [Representative] Shirley Chisholm ran for president that year.  And they came and said we want you to run for a delegate seat.  Fine, I mean, [HM] Julian Bond, [HM] [Representative] John Lewis, and Ben [Brown], and--you want me to run, fine.  So they had me fill out the forms.  They said we'll take it back to Atlanta [Georgia] tomorrow and we'll file for you.  I read in the paper the next day I'm running against [President] Jimmy Carter for a delegate seat to the Democratic National Convention.  [President] Jimmy Carter was the governor [Georgia].  But you had to run according to districts.  At that time, Fort Valley [Georgia] was in the 3rd Congressional District.  [President] Jimmy Carter lived in that district.  He was in all the way across the Americus [Georgia], and he lived in Plains [Georgia].  But Americus [Georgia], which was ten miles, was where they had the caucus.  So I said and if they think I can run against [President] Jimmy Carter, you know, being a young leader and the attitude we had, we can do anything.  Look, we had elected all these people.  We had trouble finding buses 'cause Greyhound Trailways suddenly didn't have buses 'cause we had Student Government budget and all of those things.  So we got church buses and all, and we had to trek all the way over to Americus, Georgia for the caucus.  I remember that year I met Ms. Lillian [Lillian Gordy Carter, mother of President Jimmy Carter].  (Laughter) She was in there campaigning for her son.  And we got there, they didn't-[Governor of Georgia] Zell Miller was the executive director of the Democratic Party.  I didn't even get a letter saying we'd be allowed to speak that morning.  They just said the caucus would be there.  And so we went hustling over there, and they--we had one time to be there.  And we got there and they said well, you can't speak.  It's too late because you had to be here and blah, blah this.  So we went on.  We got into it.  They had at least to stand--went ahead and held the elections.  [President] Jimmy Carter won by fifteen votes, his delegate seat.  But the other side of it was we had one church bus that broke down before they could get there to vote, and then that was history.  But I couldn't believe anything other than I could do it.  And I ran as a delegate committed to [Representative] Shirley Chisholm and Americus, Georgia against [President] Jimmy Carter.  But I look back over my days, because there, again, he's--here were--and they weren't that much older, but [HM] Julian [Bond], [HM] [Representative] John [Lewis], and all of them believed in me and believed in our leadership.  And that's the kind of reinforcement; again, you can do whatever you want.  And so I look back at those days in college and think about all the things that we were able to do and support, and, and it made a difference, really made a difference.
Speaker 2: What service organization did you bring on campus?  You said, "I had brought a service organization."
Speaker 1: It's, it's an organization called Alpha Phi Omega--Alpha Phi Omega Service Fraternity.  It's the first and only one they had on campus [Fort Valley State University, Georgia].  And I actually brought it there in 1969.  And we were the first major chapter on the Historically Black College campus.
Story_ID: 58918
Speaker 1: And when you were running as a delegate, which is a pretty thing--when you were doing--was that your senior year?
Speaker 2: That was my senior year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was Student Government President doing my thing.  This was in the spring of my senior year.  And we had done so many things.  We had made a difference.  And it's so funny because also during that year when I was pushing all of these voter registration drives, and we created an organization called the Citizens and Students Committee for a Better Community; we called it CASCBC.  We had planned this big rally where we were gonna have all the students join the Student Center [Fort Valley State University, Georgia].  We were gonna march down to the courthouse and register to vote.  Well, somebody had called the GBI [Georgia Bureau of Investigation] in the governor's office [Georgia] and said there was gonna be a major riot on Fort Valley [State University, Georgia]'s campus.  And the students were gonna demonstrate and all of this and--but I had everybody to assemble at the Student Center, and I got up and I spoke to the students.  And, and the one thing that we always understood and, you know, having communicated with [HM] Julian [Bond] and those, simply said look, that we're gonna go down; we're gonna march down in, in double files.  You're not to interrupt traffic.  And we're gonna be orderly, and you're you'rr not to disrupt, and this.  We're not gonna do this, that, and the other.  So I gave these instructions, and one of the GBI [Georgia Bureau of Inversigation] agents who now sit on the Georgia Lottery Board came to me and said, "Mr. Dortch, I am so proud of you."  He said, "We were down here," and he said, "Let me just tell you there's several agents right here on this campus right now.  We've got [Georgia] state patrol on hold.  I got an alert for state patrol.  We got GBI [Georgia Bureau of Investigation] agents all in the city."  We were called in and the [Georgia] governor had issued a directive to go ahead and have special troops here, 'cause the local elected officials had said that you were going to be rioting down here.  He said, "After I listened to you the first five minutes," he said "I radioed in and told them to dispatch and to send those--the officers back in, that this is one of the most orderly gatherings he had ever been at.  And he said, "As a matter of fact, I'm gonna make sure that you've got folks who are there to escort you to make sure that there's no mess from any of them bothering you students."  But I think back over those days, but we also understood.  And I also went back to high school, back to my upbringing, understanding you don't have to be confrontational first, you know; that's, that's a last resort.  The issue was when you do the right things for the right reasons the right things happen.  And so we did that, and we made a difference and changed the lives in that city.  And it was all about students helping adults, because there, again, I was in a fifty-seven [percent African American city, Fort Valley, Goergia], and I went from a ten percent [Toccoa, Georgia] to fifty-seven percent African-American city.  And there was only one African American, elected official when I got there, a guy by the name of Clayborn [J.] Edwards, who's a funeral director.  He was elected to the city council, had gone through a challenge that went to the Supreme Court [Georgia], 'cause they were gonna say in Fort Valley [Georgia] black folks hadn't paid the poll tax and therefore his votes had to come from black folks, and he shouldn't have been seated.  But he went to the Supreme Court [Georgia], and he won his seat--Georgia Supreme Court.  He was seated as the first city [Fort Valley, Georgia] councilman.  For me the numbers just didn't add up.  If it's fifty-seven percent black, which means the majority, there should be more than one black elected official, and we changed that.  We changed the landscape in that city [Fort Valley, Georgia], which has been another thing that's caused me to stay involved politically.  Because I truly believe that to advance we have to be involved in two arenas: economics and politics.  And they have to work together.  You cannot have economics and not have some control in politics, because: one, you can make the money but it's the policies that can govern what happens and how it happens.  You can, you can have the politics, but if you don't control economics, you don't have the real power either.  And so we tried to mix those in together.
Story_ID: 58919
Speaker 1: That's pretty amazing.  So you became a change agent (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Hey-
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous)--in college.
Speaker 2: --and had fun doing it.
Speaker 1: --doing it.
Speaker 2: And enjoyed it; and, again, helping young people to believe that there vote counted; their involvement made a difference, at the same time, pushing the adults to take the leadership to run for those offices.
Speaker 1: And at that time were you thinking at all about yourself being in political office?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: No, what I was thinking about from--and, and it's amazing what I learned.  'Cause from sociology is the study of people.  And I learned from the political sciences, as I had had the practical experience first, and I learned in there that you had to really help people to empower themselves.  I learned this from the class.  And then the young teachers--I had these folks who challenged you and the teachers in the classroom.  And then the older folks like Dr. Piero, who is dead, who used to say, "Son, now what you gonna do with yourself?"  I mean you, you--still the reinforcement.  And, and then teachers who believed in--and reinforced what I was doing and saying this is good.  So I had the reinforcement, then to have a [HM] Julian Bond that I've watched and what they had done from SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee], from the Student Nonviolent Co--Coordinating Committee, and what they had done over in the AU [Atlanta University] Center; I mean, following the blueprint.  And so for me it wasn't about what's in it for me.  It's who--what can I do for my community and for my people.  And just like we said, the next generation should have a better place once, you know, the current generation moves ahead.  My attitude was being in that city [Fort Valley, Georgia], us students who depended on that city, who benefitted from the resources of that city should have left something better for that city when we graduated and moved from that city, 'cause that was our home for four years, and we did that.
Story_ID: 58920
Speaker 1: Now it was after that that you became a Ford Fellow [Ford Fellowship, Georgia State University], was that?
Speaker 2: Then when I graduated there was a guy by the name of Happy Lee, [Reverend] Helsip [Malbert] Lee, from Georgia State [University]--see, when I graduated in '72' [1972] it was still very popular to be an African American going to college because they were getting monies to get minority students in college.  So Happy [Helsip] Lee was recruiting, and so we were part of the dream team, 'cause Ohio State University, Georgia State [University], and all them were trying to recruit students.  So Happy [Helsip] Lee came to my campus trying to recruit students to come to the Urban Life Program, a brand new program.  Ford [Fellowship, Georgia State University] was putting out all of this money.  And so I had narrowed down my decision on graduate school between Georgia State [Georgia] and the program they had and, and Ohio State University.  And I went to Ohio State in the winter of my senior year.  And I got there and it snowed like cats and dogs; it just snowed and it snowed.  And I had left cold weather, 'cause in North Georgia it got pretty cold.  But I had kind of transformed down in North Georgia and loved the heat.  So I decided--'cause Dr. [Frank W.] Hale at, at Ohio State [University] was one of those persons that tried to recruit great facilities.  The dorms looked like, looked like hotel rooms.  But for me, I was not gonna be caught in that cold weather.  And I came back and told Happy [Helsip Lee] I'll come to Georgia State [University] as a Ford Fellow and study urban administration.  And came--decided on Georgia State [University].  Now back then they were paying real--$10,000 [ten thousand dollars] a year, living expenses, all the tuition, book fees, membership, so it was pretty good.  It was good to be upon the--among the chosen few, so I did that.
Speaker 1: Okay, we'll change tapes.
Story_ID: 58921
Speaker 1: --good education, get a good job.  And for some reason--and it may have been dad [Thomas Dortch, Sr.] didn't want us to settle into Toccoa [Georgia], to go out and see the world rather than getting so entrenched in the business side.  But the one thing that I tell young people, there's something to be said that when you wake up on the morning, and you're feeling good about what you've done, your accomplishments and think you've done a good job in your business, and you can look yourself in the mirror and say: Tommy Dortch, you did a great job; I'm giving you a raise.  I'll tell you it's nothing like that.  But the other side is--for me--is knowing that there are people who depend on me and going out every day to work to make sure that my employees are gonna get paid, that there their families are taking care of.  There's something special about that feeling.  I mean you hear it and you hear it, but creating jobs and creating wealth is--I mean it's a wonderful thing.  And, and I tried--try to tell people we have been taught too long, and we have been conditioned to believe that making money is bad.  But if it's so bad, why do so many folks making the billions and millions and trying to make more?  Why is the CEO of Microsoft fifty-four billion and fifty-six billion dollars rich and still trying to get as much more as it can?  Now the thing for me, though, I am well-grounded 'cause my mother and my wife say you can't take it with you.  Daddy Grace [Marcelino Manuel De Graca] and Father Divine [Reverend J. Divine] found that, and I don't think they took it with 'em in the grave.  Folks had to get that money out of there.  But, but creating jobs and creating wealth is something we have teach our kids.  It's something we have to do.  We cannot just be consumers, and I've learned that.  So for me, I took the public service route, don't regret it, made a lot of changes.  I mean being the first--as I tell young people, being the first means nothing if at the end of being the first you have not helped to bring others so that you were the first but not the only.  And that's why you have to work hard.  And even when I left, I tried to make sure that there were successors.  Being the first African American staff person for the [Georgia] State Democratic Party in 1974 felt good.  But when you put it into perspective, in 1974 I should not have been the first.  Being the first state director for U.S. Senator Sam Nunn felt good [1978], but I should not have been the first African American in the history of the U.S. Senate to be a state director for a U.S. Senator.  That's a lot of power in those kind of positions and influence that you have, but I was a first.  And I was a first because a Southern senator who was well grounded, who dealt with your worth and what you bring to the table, [Senator] Sam Nunn decided I was gonna be his state director.  I would have thought that [President John F.] Kennedy, and, and [Vice President Joe] Biden, and some of those other folks would have done it.  But since I've left, I don't know if it's more than two.  When I left it was one, and that was Senator [Bob] Kerrey out in Nebraska.  But you work hard.  But one thing, though, when I left Sam Nunn's staff forty-sex percent of my staff was African American, and almost sixty percent of my staff were women, and we were smokin'.  We were more trying--we were basically handling thirty-three thousand cases a year.  And we were delivering, and [Senator] Sam Nunn was still considered one of the most powerful and in the top five members of Congress in the nation.  And that didn't happen because we weren't doing our job.  We helped to make it happen.  But with [Senator] Sam Nunn, the issue with him wasn't whether or not how many African Americans, how many women.  It's just, hey, do the job; give me a team to do the work.
Story_ID: 58922
Speaker 1: Let me ask you, how did you get to know [Senator] Sam Nunn?  How did that--that, that came from the, the-
Speaker 2: Dem-
Speaker 1: --being at the Democratic-
Speaker 2: Democratic Party--as associate director to [Georgia] State Democratic Party.
Speaker 1: Then how did that first come about then?  You got-
Speaker 2: Well-
Speaker 1: --you're at-
Speaker 2: Let me tell you how I got there.  Of course [HM] Julian [Bond], and Ben [Brown] and [HM] [Representative] John Lewis, all of them, and we're all friend, and, and I trusted their judgment.  And so coming from Fort Valley [State University] --and then I started working as a community development consultant in the [President Jimmy] Carter Administration after I graduated and almost beating him.  And, and my job was working to help find resources for the Appalachian Childcare Project.  In one of the cities I went back to do something and it was Toccoa, Georgia, to help get the local county government, the city government to come together and create a child day centers in order to help parents who was on public assistance, to put their children in these daycare centers, go get training and go, go to work.  And when we explained to them how the dollars and cents made sense--because when you don't have to spend the money on public assistance, you got people now working, paying taxes; you got children who are learning, breaking the vicious cycle.  So, they bought into it.  And through the Appalachian Childcare Program--and it's funny.  My mother [Lizzie Dortch] ended up later working at that center, working with the young people, and she loved it.  And it was really something special.  She went to school and college in Gainesville [Georgia] to get her training to be certified to work there at the daycare center.  So that was good, but that still kept me moving in communities.  And so when [President] Jimmy Carter's turn was about up, this is where my good buddies and mentors had kind of split in a ways--Lonnie [C.] King [Jr.] went with Bert Lance.  And they were overworking, and they came back and said well, if you support Bert Lance, the [President Jimmy] Carter Administration will guarantee your job.  If [President Jimmy] Carter--if Bert Lance loses, they'll make sure your job is solid and set, and you won't have a problem.  If he wins, you know, you'll be taken care of.  [HM] Julian [Bond] and--Bond--and Ben Brown, who were in the legislature, came to me said look, there's a man over here we work with.  And he's been in the House twenty-seven years.  He's a man with integrity.  If [Governor] George Busbee tells you he's gonna do something, he'll do it.  We want you to talk to George.  Now on Bert [Lance]'s side they wanted me to talk to some people--fine.  [Governor] George Busbee wanted to talk directly to me, and that meant volumes to me.  And when he came, not only did I decide to support him, I decided to support him without a penny.  They were gonna offer me money to be over in Bert Lance campaign as a staff person's salary.  I was so impressed with [Governor] George Busbee.  One, it impressed me that he took the time to come to talk to me.  I was impressed because the people I trusted--and I trusted Lonnie, but [HM] Julian [Bond] and [HM] [Representative] John [Lewis] came to me saying, "We're gonna support him, and these are the reasons."  And so I got involved, and it's the best thing that ever happened.  And after the election, even though I took no money to help in that campaign, took no staff--a salaried position--after it was over, they say, "What do you want?"  He wanted to give me a job on his staff.  First of all, I didn't wanna go.  George [S.] Busby was a workhorse.  And his thing--no, he, he--no, [Senator] Sam Nunn had the workhorse not a show horse.  But he, he, he would get up early in the morning, work all day and look for somewhere to go campaign.  And I said I'm not gonna be going down there six-thirty, seven and in the morning working down there at that Jones-and didn't wanna be tied down into that kind of structured environment.  So [HM] Julian [Bond] and Ben [Brown] in their own normal way came back and said "Look, Democratic Party never had any African Americans.  We want you over there."  And so I went ahead and said, "Okay, if you think this is where I should be," 'cause they talked about what, what all we could do as a team.  Marge Thurman was appointed the chair--first woman chair of the [Georgia] State Democratic Party.  I was going in as first African American staff member.  And Stu[art E.] Eizenstat was coming in.  He was an attorney--Jewish--who was gonna help rewrite the bylaws for the state.  So they were puttin' kind of a rainbow coalition team together over there; and went over--had, had a ball; I did it.  And part of my responsibility as associate director was to coordinate the schedules and activities of the congressional delegation.  So that's where I first met [Senator] Sam Nunn, got to know them, and, and they were impressed with how I dealt with details and all.  And I moved around the state.  I wrote the first affirmative action program for the party and helped design the compliance review.  'Cause during that time, we were changing also the requirement that African Americans, and minorities, and women had to have major roles in the, in the National Democratic Convention.  And every party had to come up with a plan, and I wrote the one for Georgia; so got involved; did all those things.
Story_ID: 58923
Speaker 1: And so in 1978, having been there with the party, Ernie Moore had been with Senator [Sam] Nunn briefly.  And Ernie [Moore] was deciding to leave.  And he was going to take a position in private gov--government or somewhere in a private business.  And so first Joe Brandon came and said we-"Senator [Sam] Nunn likes you; really would like you to consider coming to work for us."  I said, "Joe, it's fine but kind of like where I am."  'Cause I've been-[Governor George] Busbee--we've been to Europe, 'cause he was the first governor really started trying to recruit international business to Georgia.  I was enjoying that.  And as a matter of fact, right after we won the, the election for governor, I was the--one of the deputy campaign managers for Amendment Two.  And that was the amendment that allowed the governor to succeed himself.  At that time it was only one term.  So me and Robin Harris out of DeKalb County, used to be the president of federal--DeKalb Federal [Savings and Loan].  We put together a strategy, ran the campaign.  We won in every county, which allowed a governor to succeed himself.  I think that was '76' [1976] when we, we handled that.  So I was involved, enjoying that, and so all of that took place.  And in '78'[1978] after Joe [Brandon] came, and I said no, Richard Ray, who was at that time the chief, chief of staff, came down, talked with me, and said "[Senator] Sam Nunn really likes you--whatever--really wish you'd consider."  I said I would like to, but I really like what I'm doing.  So that was two.  The third time I get this call: "[Senator] Sam Nunn would like to have lunch with you."  Well, you know, you don't tell [Senator] Sam Nunn no.  I mean I like him; we were friends.  So we sat--we spent an hour and a half together for lunch, just talking about issues and all.  And then at the end of it, senator [Sam Nunn] said I really would like to have you on my team.  Well, again, just as [Governor] George Busbee impressed me, the fact that he did this--and I called the governor and said look-"Call him at the Governor's Mansion"-"I said I just had lunch with [Senator] Sam Nunn.  And he's offered me a job on his staff and would like for me to come."  And the other thing he told me--'cause the thing I liked about Senator [Sam] Nunn he said that two--only two-"Only two rules that I live by: one is I would not make decisions on for people that I wouldn't want made on me; he said the other is that you don't have to publicly support anything or any positions that I, I take."  He said the "Only thing is we have an understanding you won't publicly oppose me."  He said you always have an open door.  You can come and debate it, but after we debated it, you know, again, you don't go out publicly against it.  And for me that was the best thing I could have, 'cause one, he had been portrayed as being this ultra conservative guy, which [Senator] Sam Nunn really--if you really looked at his votes he's more moderate.  So I was im--impressed, and I called the governor [George Busbee].  Governor said "Tommy, first let me make it clear: I would hate to see you leave."  He said "I'd--I like the, the work that you do, and you've been a great partner and a friend."  He said, "Now that's my personal side."  But he said, "I would be doing an injustice if I said don't leave."  He said, "[Senator] Sam Nunn hadn't scratched the surface.  He's smart, he's talented," and he said, "I think you would be great for him, and he would be one of the best persons you could ever work for."  So I said, "Okay, I'll try it."  And the senator [Sam Nunn] had told me, he said, "Well, if you agree, work out with the chief of staff whatever salary you want."  Well, cool (laughter), so I took the position in 1978 and never looked back.  I left his office in 1995, stayed there almost seventeen years.  And we made a lot of difference, from everything from the mentor protege to the five percent goal for Defense Procurement for minorities to the Guaranty Surety Bond Program, Surety Bond Waiver; did all of those things.  He supported every piece of Civil Rights legislation that ever came up.  He was a co-sponsor to the Martin Luther King historical district legislation and the Martin Luther King holiday, anything I brought before him, and even the issue on Bortz when the whole thing about Robert Bortz--he opposed him for judge, federal judge.  [HM] Julian Bond would write.  He made sure he always personally answered [HM] Julian [Bond's] letters 'cause he said I have a respect for [HM] Julian [Bond].  When everybody else was running away, Joe Lowry and all of them had open door.  I say [Senator] Sam Nunn's a very unique guy, and I learned a lot from him because whatever he said on Monday morning, at midnight Sunday night he had the same position.  And if he changed anywhere between that, he picked up the phone and called, and I learned a lot from that.  So, so that got me into [Senator] Sam Nunn in 1978 and stayed with him all those years.  I was the deputy campaign director for a couple of his campaigns.  I took leave to be the--one of the deputy campaign directors for the Clinton-Gore campaign [1992].  I got involved in a lot of things, 'cause he's the one who put [President Bill] Clinton in as the chair of the Democratic Leadership Council.  'Cause when he--he was the first president, and they put [President Bill] Clinton in the mainstream.  And what most people don't know is [President Bill] Clinton didn't announce he was running for president until [Senator] Sam Nunn told me he wasn't running.  He called and then senator finally said, "I've made up my mind.  I'm not running."  That's when [President] Bill Clinton announced.  But they were always friends and worked hand-in-hand.  And [Senator] Sam Nunn--it was amazing the kind of guy--and the reason why I did so well was I told him the good stuff and the bad.  My whole attitude: you should know what people are saying good about you; (laughter) you need to know what they're saying bad about you.  That's what helped he and I to have that kind of relationship and friendship.  And when I left in January of 1995, he said, "Well, if you're gonna leave the staff, the one thing I wanna do is make sure we remain with some kind of relationship."  So he said, "I wanna be your first client."  And I signed him up as a, as a client in my consulting firm.  And that--and then we've close ever since then.
Story_ID: 58924
Speaker 1: That's a fabulous story.  Did you find in that--you know, 'cause I was sort of impressed when I was looking that you spent that much time, and you've been with 100 Black Men about--you know (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --about the same time, sixteen years-sixteen, seventeen years.  But what, what things did you learn about the political system and politics, and you know, that, that you think--well, one--that's, that's find out things you were surprised about.
Speaker 2: Right.  Well, you know, I used to see these individuals on the Florida House and Senate Democrats and Republicans down there fighting like cats and dogs and after each other.  And then when they left the floor, when the cameras weren't on 'em, how close of friends they were when they'd be in the cloak room or leaving and talking about, well, are we gonna have dinner tonight, and how's your brother and sister, and did that thing work out for them?  Call me if you need me.  You learn that when you're on the stage and you're trying to get your point over, you deal on the stage.  When you're off the stage, you leave those things on the stage.  You having differences in views, differences in views and political positions doesn't mean you can't be friends.  And because you're a Republican doesn't mean you can't be a friend with a Democrat or vice versa.  And one of the things I've been trying to change in the African-American community: we have a disagreement, we disagree for life.  We go so long we can't even remember what we disagreed on, and we're still angry.  They have disagreements of all kind of magnitudes, but they will deal with each other out of respect and necessity.  I learned that.  I also learned the art of negotiation even more so.  And I learned that sometimes in winning you can you.  And sometimes in losing you can win.  You have to measure what do I gain by winning on this debate?  And what happens if I lose?  And so you learn all of that.  And the thing for me, again, is how to maneuver and deal with people.  Because I may not like you in terms of how you are personally and your character doesn't mean I can't work with you or deal with you.  And in order for me to achieve I may need your support.  And then my attitude is you never, ever burn bridges.  You build bridges; you patch them up.  I learned all that during those days in dealing in Congress and found out also, one of the things through politics: Even when people may not like you, there are some who wanna pay their debt.  And if you get paid up front, whether you're working a campaign and they pay you a salary, you've been paid.  But I like you owing me, meaning when my community needs something, I wanna be able to call on you and say we need to do this.  'Cause I used to have a lot of candidates used to say but, but what do you want?  Do you want a position?  Do you want an appointment, and I say no; I need this.  And they never considered my asking them to support initiatives and to support communities paying me back personally, and I never wanted to get paid back personally.  So for me, there was more respect.  And I tell folks I write checks when I work in campaigns.  You don't have to pay me.  I'm gonna pay my way.  I wanna be a contributor because I want to make sure, 'cause I understand the system.  The people who, who made contributions, people would be crazy to think that they're not gonna be listened to.  You don't have to agree with them, but at least to be heard.  And that's what it's all about.  It's not about making a donation and knowing that people just gonna give you what you want.  I understand how the political system works.  It's about access to make your case.  It's not about access for you to give me what I want.  And for people to think that you don't do that--and, and in the current political systems tell me what person rewards their enemies?  What person wants their enemies to benefit?  People want their friends and supporters to succeed.  It's no different from that from the, from the [President Jimmy] Carter White House when I worked there, the [President Gerald] Ford White House, or back to the [President Richard] Nixon White House, or to the [President Ronald] Reagan White House, or to the [President George H. W.] Bush White House, or to the [President Bill] Clinton White House, and now back to the [President George W.] Bush White House.  People support their friends.  The same thing happens in every governor's race.  And for people to think otherwise and let these fools out here, and even the papers like the [Atlanta] Constitution Journal, to think you--that folks reward their enemies, that's crazy.  I don't know anywhere in the world on any political landscape that people reward their enemies.  And so I learned, though, that it's better to invest, and my investment is in good government.  If I think enough of a candidate to support them and to tell people to vote for them, I also think enough to write a check to help, 'cause it costs a lot of money to run for public office.  And so that's what it's all about.  I've learned that from the system.
Story_ID: 58925
Speaker 1: The other thing I've learned out here, and especially from a perspective of being an African-American man, there are those who are afraid. and still fear us, and fear the potential.  There's a group of folks out there now who fear that over the next ten years the majority of our nation's population are gonna be people of color.  And there are people who are afraid that we will not be as tolerant and as fair, when in fact, that is us by nature.  And so when the attacks take place now--when you look around this nation, African-American leadership still gets attacked.  I tell people in this city I don't defend; I never try; and never feel that I have to defend what [HM] Bill Campbell did as mayor [Atlanta, Georgia].  There are some things I would have done differently.  I disagree with some of his tactics, but I also feel his pain, because [HM] [Mayor] Bill Campbell came in the office trusting and believing if you try to bring people together, they're gonna work with you and get the support.  Well, the thing that I think that turned [HM] [Mayor] Bill [Campbell] in a different direction was that the issue on Freaknik [Atlanta, Georgia].  [HM] [Mayor] Bill Campbell came out there and stood firm and said, "We're not gonna have those students coming here and whatever."  He ain't get an African-American, and when he turned the white business community was gone, and nobody backed him.  He was out there on a limb by himself, and I think that was part of the turning point.  And [HM] [Mayor] Bill [Campbell] in the African-American community many people felt, hey, this man is trying to just go kiss up to the big business community.  And he did almost a three-sixty degree turn.  Well, that was [HM] [Mayor] Bill [Campbell].  That's not the way I would have politically have handled it.  But even today, it gets back to the thing I talked about friendship.  My parents taught me, and I've grown up believing that nobody can tell you who your friends are.  And your friends have to be accountable for their action.  But because a friend makes a mistake, screws up, or as well call it, that should be a reason for you to stop being their friend.  You try to help them by counseling them.  It's the same thing when our Wall Street Journal interviewed me about Coca-Cola.  And while everybody was running and condemning Coke, I said Coke is a friend.  And what friends do is when they need you the most is when you're there to counsel them.  And I said we will counsel, and make suggestions on how they deal with this, and to make a difference in there.  I said but we are also friends.  We're gonna hold Coke accountable to do the right thing while everybody was running; same thing I said with, with [HM] [Mayor] Bill [Campbell].  But because I've taken those stances--I mean look at the political landscape-[Atlanta] Constitution Journal has made me a target.  I mean just recently they ran this article which was so full of lies that you say okay.  But because of my solid foundation, I don't worry about it.  Just a case in point, which I've been about this a lot, they decided to run a story on friends of [HM] [Mayor] Bill Campbell.  I was brought into a company by a very close friend of Rob Pitts, who was the president in city council.  And a lady who supported [HM] Marvin [S.] Arrington [Sr.] over [HM] [Mayor] Bill [Campbell], Sharon Adams, we created a company [TWD Consulting Firm, 1999] 'cause we were looking for diversity.  And my partners in the company: one's Hispanic, Sharon's a white female, and then my being an African American, but I'm the specialist on procurement, having done that, we created this company.  They recruited me.  I helped them to move--we started in 1999, just recently, because the Constitution Journal decides it wants to write a story on friends of [Mayor of Atlanta] Maynard Jackson and [HM] [Mayor] Bill Campbell who got contracts at the airport.  They interviewed me a month ago.  They verified how I got in the business; they verified it was a friend of Rob Pitts, but they came back and said we don't care that [HM] [Mayor] Bill Campbell had nothing to do with you in this; we don't care that Rob Pitts' friends were involved  and they brought you into the company [TWD Consulting].  This is a story about friends of [HM] [Mayor] Bill Campbell who have a contract at the airport.  And then skewed the story, making people think it's my company.  And then to make matters worse, which I take offensive of, as I said when you deal with my family--my wife [Carole Dortch] is one of the most qualified persons in the arena.  My wife started working at the airport two years after I started this.  In the article they said months after I get my contract she is hired as assistant--as the deputy director to the airport.  Well, when you look at that, and you learned about the political system, rather than blowing up, I just said okay.  The reality is I have arrived, 'cause when they talk about you--if I'm in with [HM] Herman [J.] Russell and I'm in with [Mayor] Maynard Jackson, that's very good company, and with our current mayor.  But I look at the political system.  If I were weak I would worry; I would be out fighting.  But I've learned all of this, just as [Senator] Sam Nunn who took the hits when he didn't agree with going into Desert Storm and with blazing guns and cannons and bombs, who wanted to wait.  Well, I learned that much from him, is that there's a time to fight, there's a time to sit, but also as long as you're confident and believe and know you've done the right thing, you don't worry about it.  But it's those challenges today, when I look at what I have to do and what I'm trying to do, you have to be strong because in this society, and even after that article, that not one time did they talk about us African American business owners and whether we're qualified and whether we're doing a good job.  The angle was to discredit us.  But those are the challenges that I see out there when I look at what I have to do.  And while I have to be strong when my friends say see if you' wouldn't get involved in community service and just make your money and enjoy life, you wouldn't have to put up with this, the point is that community service got me to where I am; and that community service is important to the future for my kids and grandkids.  And so if you have to take those hits, it is the strong who take those hits for the future of the generations to follow.

Speaker 1: Now talk about your businesses, and then I wanna go really and spend some time on 100 Black Men.  But talk about your businesses and how you even got (unclear) this--was it--let me ask--here you are, you're working for [Senaotr] Sam Nunn.  You're seeing a lot of--were you impressed with the number of businesses that were being set up and, and the fact that your father had been in business, and was that--since he (unclear) the seventeen-year--(unclear)-
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, well, the thing with [Senator] Sam Nunn is that I was kind of the small business specialist.  I had a number of responsibilities, from being a liaison between local governments, helping to make sure that, that the local governments got the kind of support services from our office when they were trying to get grants and all.  I worked to make sure that we removed the barriers from small and minority owned business and female owned businesses with the disputes they had with federal government in getting paid on time and getting procurement opportunities.  I used to conduct all of the procurement conferences--Defense Procurement Conferences.  I was involved in planning those and the U.S. Small Business Administration Procurement Conference; used to do all those and help to create the Mentor Protege Program and helped to do the Prompt Pay Act and Guaranty Surety Bond Program, and, and all of these pieces of legislation, the five percent goal for Defense Procurement, the SBA Small Business Set Aside Program.  I was involved in the, in the new modifications and all of those.  So I became one of the specialists and was involved with multiple congressional offices designing these kind of programs on the federal level.  But I looked over the years of all the people I'd helped, and advice, and all of that done.  I helped to make about thirty-one millionaires.  And I decided, now, if my advice has helped them, my advice may help me, and--but, you know, you have to make the decision.  And what really helped me to make the final decision after all of these years, there was a company out of San Diego [California] called Biola.  And they were a publicly traded company that recruited me and recruited me, tried to get me to be president and CEO of the company, and--to the point they said they wanted to really sit down and make an offer.  Well, I brought my classmate, who is my attorney, [James] Mac Hunter, and we sat and negotiated.  And [James] Mac [Hunter] was a heck of a negotiator, and still is; he's handles all of my legal services.  So he said, "Well, if you want the services of Tommy Dortch, you know, we need to talk about a signing bonus and all this stuff."  These folks agreed to give me a $150,000 signing bonus just to sign the contract.  They a--agreed to about $400,000 in stock.  They gave me one heck of a salary, and incentives, and all of that stuff.  And [James] Mac [Hunter] drew up the contract and, and then another 25,000 [dollars] for the due diligence, for my firm to do due diligence on their company.  And [James] Mac [Hunter] drew up the contract, had all kind of default clauses in there.  And part of the agreement I was gonna move the company from San Diego [California] to Atlanta [Georgia].  And there were certain benchmarks they to meet on certain dates.  They missed the first two.  One of 'em was to put a half million dollars into a bank account to help with the transition and all that stuff, and this, that, and several other things.  And then in January they came back with some other stuff.  But while a due diligence was being done, we found out that the company was manipulating the market by doing these press releases and go up.  The guy that owned the company was worth over fifty million.  But anyway, we went through this.  [James] Mac [Hunter] said, "Tommy, I got a bad feeling."  I talked to one of my good buddies who was president--former president of Aflac, who was a very good friend, Sal[vador] Diaz-Verson, who also invested all of Aflac's money.  He said you don't look to this, 'cause he's the first one I asked to be one of my board members, cause they allowed me even to set up a new board.  So he said, "You don't wanna do this.  As president and CEO, if they mess up, you're liable."  So [James] Mac [Hunter] counseled and he said look, we're finding too much bad stuff.  We looked at all this.  We're gonna declare a default.  We declared a default.  And I said now what do I do with this signing bonus?  They said it's your money (laughter).  And so these folks tried to sue to make me give them monies.  They countersued.  We got a legal and got another fifty thousand dollars.  So I took my money after Uncle Sam took his share, 'cause all this happened in late December.  I got a check I saved I'm framing for--I never thought I'd pay that much money in one lump sum in taxes.  I paid more money for Uncle Sam on that than I made in all my salary for the whole year, the last year with [Senator] Sam Nunn.  But I wrote Uncle Sam his money; took that money and started my first com--I bought a, a building that I converted to an office and all the stuff I needed to do.  'Cause the other thing I had taught folks in all, I say you should have at least--early on it was nintey days, so you have at least four months of revenue--
Story_ID: 58927
Speaker 1: --after Uncle Sam took his part and my attorneys were all paid off.  And so I purchased this building, renovated it, and had one--I got my office if I need it, and I own it a hundred percent free and clear; monies to go ahead and do my marketing and created all of these other things.  I know all these corporate execs and CEO, CEOs of these Fortune 500 companies--(unclear)--all these defense folks, and I worked with all these companies.  And you know, the--and the one thing was, okay, I'm ready to go.  Now [Senator] Sam Nunn was the first client; Sal[vador] Diaz-Verson was the second client.  Of the thirty-one millionaires I've made, not one of 'em, not one 'em called to see how I was doing; not one of 'em called to see can, can we use your services, none of that, and--but I proceeded.  But there as one person who came to me.  Ed Bowen I remember said you know, again, whatever we can do, we're gonna find something to do, because I've worked with Ed [Bowen] when he was doing his thing with the feds in developing and really helping make sure the folks didn't run over him.  So he came back and said, "Well, look, somewhere we gotta find some way to do business."  Well, Ed [Bowen] still pursued and tried, but because of what I'd gotten from this, this settlement, and because of [Senator] Sam Nunn's contract and sale, I was off and running.  But the biggest thing for me wasn't so much the contract with [Senator] Sam Nunn, was his name and the fact he's telling other folk, you know, this is--I'm his client all, so, hey, great.  And Sal[vador Garcia-Verson] was referring people, and I was helping him with his company, 'cause Sal had left and he started an investment banking firm.  So, again, I followed my own, own principles and prac--[outside interruption]--so I followed my own principles and practices and applied for me.  And I got a contract with the defense, got a subcontract working with some other firms doing some research and stuff for some universities, so business started to move.  And as I started to grow, and then all of a sudden those millionaire folks first start trying to come back and--but the funny thing, they didn't wanna come back and see how can they contract with me.  They were coming back trying to get some free advice.  And as I told my assistant, tell 'em first if they want to sit down and talk about retaining the services of my firm, I will be more than happy to sit down and do that.  But otherwise, there's no free service.  And told him just as they pay the lawyer and their accountants, my services are by the hour or retainer.  And so I didn't worry about 'em.  I continued to move, and then I started getting more Fortune 500 clients, and things really started rolling.  And so from a consultant firm that was going.  And looking at the [1996 Atlanta] Olympics coming, and I got approached--[outside interruption]--the traffic--I got approached by Jesse Hill [Jr.], 'cause I had worked with them and helped Jesse and those get into Haiti back when the U.S. was going down for food service.  So I had a--later - until Jesse [Hill Jr.] was already a multimillionaire, so he wasn't one of those thirty-one.  But they started trying to find ways to at least refer good opportunities, which is what I do now.  Anytime something hit my desk, if I'm not interested in it, or even if I'm interested, I'm looking for some way to bring others in.  But I make sure it gets sent out to other people.  So anyway, all of that took place.  Things started to really happen for me, and, and the company started growing.  And my practices paid off for me to the point that my transportation company [Atlanta Transportation Systems] was next.  And then we eventually--and some opportunities were there, and we designed, and started implementing the non-emergency transportation for Fulton County [Georgia] Government.  Then along came the [1996 Atlanta] Olympics, and we had the official luxury companies and limousine company for the Olympics and then other opportunities.  And we created LLCs and these kind of things.  And so I took the attitude you cast a broad net, get good people, and you have to look at supply and demand.  You can't just be one company and live in doubt by that company.  And that's what I've done.  At one point, I had like one hundred twenty-nine employees, also understanding the importance of downsizing, streamlining.  And the other thing I say to people, all money is not good money, 'cause if you don't have the capacity, why get into something that's gonna kill you or drain you.  It's one thing to have your name out there, but if it's not going to meet your demands and needs for the bottom line, you don't do that.  So I've followed that process, and I've kind of move, and doing quite well.  I have a parking company [Lanier Parking].  When--also I understand from my elders before, like it's better to have twenty-five, fifty, fifty-one percent of something than a hundred percent of nothing.  I ain't ashamed.  My name doesn't have to be first on the line or last on the line, but I understand having good partners--and I learned the hard way on some case--having good partners and good, solid people who have the same philosophy.  And that's why Lanier Parking I formed from my Cornerstone Parking.  Lanier would have Landcor.  We just won all the parking from Bell South and the city [Atlanta, Georgia].  We are now probably the third largest parking company in the city.  And we just won the parking for the Atlantic Steel and the new Aquarium.  And we're bidding in other regions.  So we're moving and doing those things, but for me in business it's a matter of working hard.  My son, and my daughter, and my wife are part of the companies.  My son's a vice-chairman of the board for TWD, Inc. with cards.  My daughter's the secretary of the board and doing her thing.  They get paid at the end of the year the success fees based on the success of the company.  And I hope they decide to move in and take the companies.  But for me it's good.  And I look at good people, and the managers, and the people that work in my companies.  And it really feels good knowing that I've helped to create jobs. And I'm working on this whole wealth creation piece.

Speaker 1: You know what's interesting about this is that people around the country know you almost as the, the 100 Black [Men] (laughter) man, no men.  But I mean synonymous, even more so than your businesses, I mean around the country-
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --when they hear--when they think of 100 Black Men they think of Tommy Dortch as synonymous.  I want you-
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --to talk about how you became a--you know, what-
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --was the start of the organization-
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and how you became involved.
Speaker 2: And, and leading from business to there, because of my success, because I'm self-employed and own my companies, then I answer to me.  Of course I answer to my clients in order to keep them happy and all.  But because of that, it gives me the flexibility to use my resources and my time to move around the country--the support, the organization.  Being national chairman for 100 Black Men, and it's almost a full-time job, to the point now about forty percent of my time is involved in some kind of activity or related involvement for the 100 [Black Men].  I got involved in 100 [Black Men] late 1985 and moving in 1986.  When we formed the national organization, I was a part of their charter group for the 100 Black Men of Atlanta [Georgia].  Joe Hoffman and of course, Nate [HM Nathaniel] Goldston, they had been around talking to some of their colleagues.  At the time there were a total of nine--well, really it was ten different independent chapters of 100 Black Men.  The first chapter and the origin of 100 itself was in New York in 1963 when [HM] [Mayor] David Dinkins, Jackie Robinson, Bruce Llewellyn, and a total of 100 black men came together to address a political issue in New York and then eventually looked to the economic issues.  So in '63' [1963] we had the first chapter; '65' [1965] in New Jersey the second chapter was started.  That was started by Dr. Bob Hayling.  And then from, from New Jersey they moved over to L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  When Dr. Hayling moved to the West Coast he started another chapter in L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  And so we had a total of nine chapters when we got together.  They had the first meeting in '85' [1985] out in Las Vegas [Nevada] and said look, we need to start a national organization, and they talked about it; had some other meetings.  So in the meeting they decided when we were the newest chap--one of--not one of the newest chapters, but Atlanta [Georgia] was like, you know, Atlanta's still considered by many to be Mecca, and we had all these other things.  So we said we'll do it.  We didn't have any money.  We just said we'll host a national convention.  So of the ten chapters, nine came in.  New York decided they weren't coming in, 'cause [HM] Roscoe Brown and those had the attitude then, you know, we've been out here.  We're the first chapter.  We got all these powerful black men, and we don't want y'all running this thing.  And [HM] Roscoe [Brown] didn't know that we had the who's-who out there in these different other chapters.  So we formed 100 Black Men of America and had our first national convention in 1986 here in Atlanta, Georgia.  Alex Haley was one of our keynote speakers, the late Phyllis Hyman; and wonderful convention.  And from there, in '86' [1986] we moved to '87' [1987].  Now Dr. Hayling was elected in the first national president, since he had been involved in others.  And then after Dr. Hayling came, Nate [HM Nathaniel] Goldston, and Nate was the founding president of the Atlanta [Georgia] chapter.  So we selected Nate, 'cause he had been involved with all that had been going on out there, and Nate's a businessman.

Speaker 1: And so in 1987, we decided from the 100 [Black Men] of Atlanta [Georgia] we gotta make a bold statement.  Here we are successful black men, and we're talking about we're gonna do all this to change the lives of kids in our community.  So a group of us all got together, talked about it, and we said I know, we'll just adopt a school, 'cause we had looked at this program where the, the guy in New York had promised every kid who graduated this bicycle and all of that.  We said no, we're gonna promise these kids if they go to school and graduate we'll pay all their college expense.  And we wanted to pick a school and be bold.  We wanna go where there was no support base.  And Dr. Alonzo Crim, the late Dr. Alonzo Crim, who was the first African-American school superintendant this city [Atlanta, Georgia] ever had said well, look, there's some schools that need some support.  And he said you ought to go over there and look at Archer [School, Atlanta, Georgia].  Well, Archer was fresh on everybody's mind, because Mayor [Maynard] Jackson--at the time [Mayor] Maynard Jackson, [HM] [Representative] John Lewis, who was a congressman, Michael Lomax was chairman of Fulton County [Georgia] Commission and the chief of police, they had all decided they were gonna go over to Perry Homes, which is one of the toughest public housing neighborhoods in this city, and they were gonna spend the night over there to show their support for the people in that community.  And about midnight gunfire broke out, and it got noisy and all, and they rushed all of them out of the public housing communities.  It was all on the press.  We said that's the community; that's where we need to go, and we went to Archer.  Archer was a school with only forty-three percent of all the students who started in eighth grade class graduated, and a small handful actually went to college.  And we worked out a program with all the educators and all in our organization, and we made the promise and a contract: if you stay in school, do what you have to do we'll pay one hundred percent of your tuition; made that bold statement in '87' [1987].  And others started to watch us.  And we worked with the kids, and four years later we graduated--understanding a school that only forty-three percent graduated, we graduated about ninety-seven percent of all the students four years later who started with us in the eighth grade.  And of this class we started it with thirty-five students; twenty-seven qualified and went to college; others went to trade school, and the ones we lost, we went back and were able to get everyone but one to graduate from high school, one young lady who got pregnant that dropped out.  But the key for us was working hand-in-hand, one-on-one and group mentoring.  We created a Saturday academy.  We--somewhere around $117,000.  And every Saturday these young kids had to come to Atlanta Metropolitan College for extra instruction and SAT prep.  And, and we pay 'em a minimum wage, 'cause we didn't want any excuse about I gotta go to McDonald's, or Burger King, or Kentucky Fried Chicken to work.  And we worked with these kids.  And we decided the fact that we get 'em out of high school was success.  But we fulfilled our promise and paid for all of their college tuition.  And we did it an early assessment of all the students when they first got in the program, what they wanted out of life.  And they had everything from professional football players to a model.  And there was this young lady among all of 'em--'cause all of 'em went on to do great things--Sonya Jolt (ph.) said she wanted to be an executive secretary, and we worked with her.  Four years later when they graduated, Sonya was accepted at Syracuse [University, New York].  Of course we paid her tuition like we did all the other kids.  I just singled her out as one of 'em.  She went on and got her degree at Syracuse [University, New York], came back and said I know you only promised four years.  I really wanna go to graduate school; we paid for that.  A year or so later she got her master's degree.  She works for a Fortune 500 company now and debating on whether to go to law school, the same young lady that said that she wanted to be a--an executive secretary.  And the others went on to be teachers, and others--some dropped out, but their making a living for them fam--for their families and doing decent.
Story_ID: 58930
Speaker 1: Well, we've done programs like that, like Movement of Youth in Charlotte [North Carolina], and we have all kinds of programs.  But the 100 [Black Men] is kind of progressed and in-Nate [HM Nathaniel Goldston] served as president.  And then in 1994, after Hayling had served his two terms and Nate [HM Nathaniel Goldston] served his terms, I was elected the national president in Nashville, Tennessee.  At that time I was president and chairman.  And, and what I decided to do was to put a little structure in the organization.  By 1994, we had a total of forty-three chapters, and from 1986 to 1994, forty-three chapters.  In 1994 when I was elected, our annual budget was about $175,000.  Well, I came together and proposed a structure, 'cause we were getting so popular.  Everybody's wanting us to do everything.  And that's where I developed Four for the Future, so that everything we do in this organization it fits into those four categories, and that's education, mentoring, health and wellness, or economic development.  And that gave us a solid foundation.  We did strategic planning.  I named national chairs like a national chair for mentoring and picked a clinical psychologist who really has done a tremendous job for this organization; and put him to work; and put some structure in it.  And then I used that skill that my uncle taught me from begging for the five cents, what I had done with all the organizations.  I moved our budget initially by the second year.  As national president we had gone from 175,000 a year budget to their two million dollar a year budget.  And at one point we had peaked at about four million.  And our budget--annual budget now is about four million.  We have a total now of ninety-two chapters; we're international.  We have over one hundred twenty-thousand young people in our mentoring program.  We've been honored in the Rose Garden Ceremony at the White House.  We have partnerships with the Office of Population Affairs on a Teen Pregnancy Prevention program for black males, because we took the approach we were only having a fifty percent effort when you only talk to young ladies.  So we have that program for young men behaving responsibly.  We have an AIDS awareness and education initiative; we have a prostate cancer screening program, which we really helped to form what is called the Prostate Cancer Coalition.  And then from there we've been working with U.S. Department of Education.  And I was in Special Ed[ucation] to address this problem of Special Ed and why so many of our young black males are on these one-way streets.  And we've shown how to reverse that, even looking at Charlotte [North Carolina] in Mecklenburg County.  But we do ran a test pra--program where they selected thirty students who met all the criteria to be in Special Ed.  We worked one year with our chapter in the school system.  And at the end of one year, of those thirty-five students only three ended up in Special Ed; we turned it around.  And we're doing that in San Antonio [Texas], and we're moving out in, in Las Vegas [Nevada] and others.  And chapter is doing that.  We have technology centers.  We're putting up adult technology centers.  We have entrepreneurship mentoring programs.  We have technology mentoring programs that we're doing with AT&T; the UBS Paine Webber is the entrepreneurship program; ING Aetna.  We're working on Wall Street and those kinds of initiatives.  We've got all kinds of programs that we're doing.  We give out four hundred thousand [dollars] plus a year in scholarships nationally, probably about another two million through our chapters to get young people into college and the mentoring.  So this organization has moved to a level that we never--I won't say we never dreamed of.  But when we first started, we just wanted to get black men together, because everybody's talking about where are the black men and what they're doing?  We've been out there, but now collectively we're taking our resources, our successes, packaging those and doing for young people what was done for us.  And so this organization is, is moving.  And what we say, it's a revolution, because we're seeing more and more people going back and mentoring.  And we believe you lead, you follow, and you know when to get out of the way.  And that's what has made this organization grow.
Story_ID: 58931
Speaker 1: This building where we're in now--talking about a vision.  I believe you can't--and I had corporations and relationships where one company gave me 11,000 square feet, First Union, in a building 'cause they had moved to a whole new corpor--corporate headquarters.  And they let me have the 11th--have the 11th floor in the Candler Building, where the Coca-Cola Company was founded.  And I moved in five non-profit organizations and split up the space and as a first office for the 100 Black Men when we moved out of Nate's own company.  But my attitude as national president is you can't talk economic development if you're depending on somebody else.  So I sent out a call to all of my chapters saying there's a building we wanna buy in an historic district.  And I want the members to pitch in, and we're gonna buy that building.  And I went to Bank of America--Jim Lance, a good friend--and said we wanna buy that building.  I went to the black bank first (unclear) give an opportunity, and they tried, but they had just started up, Capital City.  And, and--but we at least believe in giving an opportunity.  They tried every way, but they just didn't have it at that time, the resources.  So Jim Lance said okay, we'll do it.  I signed--didn't have to put this building up, didn't have to guarantee any of the resources, so I signed a signature loan to buy this building.  We bought it for $203,000, and then we renovated it.  And my wife served as the general contractor because with her skills, she knew everything about it, so she oversaw it.  Ninety-six percent of all the work done on this building was done by African-American business owners.  And this is our national headquarters.  A. T. Walden's building--his, his office was on this floor.  This is historic--this is a historic building.  There used to be a pharmacy downstairs, and this used to be all downtown Atlanta [Georgia], owned by African Americans.  Across the street is Atlanta Life where, where [Alonzo] Herndon was one of the early millionaires who did his work and made a difference.  And this is the street where people believed.  And right down the street the Martin Luther King Center.  So, we're housed here right here in the neighborhood doing our good work.  And so that's where we are as a 100 [Black Men].  And we're moving, and we got all kinds of initiatives that we're, we're involved in.  But the key thing is that we--as we coined a few years ago: "What they see is what they'll be.  And we're real men giving real time."
Story_ID: 58932
Speaker 1: That's a wonderful, amazing story when you think about it.  And it's--and you know, they thing is is that when you go around the country, everyone talks about their membership-
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --for a chapter with such-
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --pride and glean.  I'm wondering, what do you think the difference between--I, I'm just curious about-
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --this.  Between the Million Man March and the impetus that was there, at--are you--you did (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: I attended.
Speaker 1: Right, you attended.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, and, and that and the after effects of that, and you know, and the 100 Black Men.  And I-
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --at least would like to have comment-
Speaker 2: right.
Speaker 1: --on that.
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, we were doing all of that we were doing long before the Million Man March.  And we went to the Million Man March.  Some of my chapters took buses. 'Cause for me it was not about the politics that folks wanted to get into this, it's Farrakhan and his message of hate and all.  This was an opportunity for black men to come together from all over the country--it ended up being from around the world--who came together on that day and stood together, stood for the family, and stood for fatherhood and all.  And so it was our chance to just stand up and be counted.  And even though they discounted how many, it had to be over two million plus of us there.  But that day was so special because young black men, and older black men, and the generations were all there together.  And, and it was a day where I saw young brothers who were quick tempered possibly in the past when they bumped you, excuse me sir.  I mean it was a day to--I mean you dream of.  And if it never happens again, it happened that day.  The thing that--the, the aftermath is I think [HM] [Louis] Farrakhan had an opportunity to seize a moment and to really take a different place in history.  But the thing that was the downer was he left after that and went to nations of oppression that were headed by Af--by, by black people where they were oppressing their own people and started talking this whole message of hate again and raising money to change the political landscape, when in fact we all knew it was against the law.  But rather than seizing the moment and moving to the next level--'cause that day was almost the most perfect day you could ever dream of for black men, and he lost that moment.  There are folks who question what happened to all the tubs of money.  I don't care.  I put my few hundred in the tubs.  I don't care what happened to the morn--to the money.  But for me it was to help with that day.  But it was a day of, of, of reckoning for us as black men to know that we have a role and to let the message be sent that we're here for the black family.  So from that it did start some things.  And then people tried to duplicate, you know.  It was a once in a lifetime dream, and it worked.  For those who had a revelation and changed their live, that's--that was good.  So there was no set, or true, or proper outcome.  It was just the fact that that day happened.  And so for us, we were there long before, and for some it caused some to rededicate themselves more.  But if nothing else happened for what Minister [HM] [Louis] Farrakhan did to help make that happen, I said thank you.  And I can say thank you to him without having to or fear of saying I agree or disagree with his philosophy.  It's about that day.  And so that's why I participated and why I was so happy to be there and to be with so many people.  When they asked me--before there CNN interviewed me and asked me about it.  I said, "Yes, I will be there."  For black men to come together and say to our wives, and our loved ones, and to the women thank you for what you've done and for shouldering your share of the burden, and we're gonna do our part.
Speaker 1: And it says a lot of about the ability to dream and make dreams happen too--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, oh yeah.
Story_ID: 58933
Speaker 1: You know, speaking of dre--dreams, what are your plans?  What, what are the plans for this organization going forward?  I mean what, what are the thoughts, you know?  And didn't--New York came into the fold, right (laughter)?
Speaker 2: New York came in.  You know, one of the things about me is after I got elected in '94' [1994], it was important that they be a part of this organization.  And they started making the inquiries, and they started seeing all the great work.  And I invited them down to Atlanta [Georgia], and we did a roll call.  We showed them the big guns from Andy [HM Andrew Young], and Maynard [Jackson], and all the folks and the Hank Aarons and for those who needed it in that chapter.  They had nothing else to say.  But the issue is there are successful black men everywhere.  But more important, we kept the olive branch and talked about them being the first chapter.  And Luther Gatling was the president.  And I flew up and met with their [New York] chapter, answered all the questions, and they eventually came on into the fold.  And we brought them in, in 1997.  And that was one of my goals, and I took care of that, and so now we are moving with ninety-two chapters.  And my goal by the end of the year and with all the new applications, and even one military base, is to have at least 1one hundred chapters by the end of this year, to really have a minimum of a hundred chapters of 100 Black Men.  And so we're moving and we're looking to expand, and I'm working to find additional resources to build capacity on a local basis for those chapters.  I'm working to, to make sure that we continue to, to encourage and work with young people.  I think that we're gonna have to look at what we do to, to address the problem of recidivism for those who've been incarcerated.  And we've gotta address the issue of all of these young black men who have been incarcerated who are gonna be coming out of prison shortly, to look at those support systems.  Even more so, we've gotta really turn it up to get more chapters in communities around this nation where they can have a collective gathering of black men who are gonna work to make sure we don't get 'em incarcerated.  I have an effort on the way now with a--looking for a unity effort with all of African-American fraternities so we can expand the number of mentors.  I'm Omega [Psi Phi], and, and Harry [E.] Johnson's my good friend.  He's the general president of Alpha [Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity].  And I've talked to the Kappas [Kappa Alpha Psi] and the Phi Beta Sigmas.  And my grand bosses has already signed on from Omega [Psi Phi] where we've started to work to get younger--more young people on college campuses to focus on being mentoring and making it mandatory.  If we can do that, we'll have hundreds of thousands or more black male mentors for these kids.  And the sororities are talking about doing it more.  So we want to be a catalyst and giving credit and praise, 'cause the Alphas [Alpha Phi Alpha] have done a tremendous job, and several other fraternities and sororities are doing a good job in partnering with big brother, big sister, and other, 'cause they still have a problem with getting black males.  And we're, we're committed to do what we have to do and do our part to be a part of the team not to be the ones who get all the credit.  It's all about getting the job done.
Story_ID: 58934
Speaker 1: Now what do you--what would you say about building institutions, because you've built an institution in a very short period of time.  And I'm--and that's not necessarily-
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --an easy thing.  But-
Speaker 2: Oh no.
Speaker 1: --you have a successful formula that-
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, first you have growing pains.  One of the--we had to step back.  I mean we started growing so fast and so rapidly.  And the organization was just moving that we found out that we actually had outgrown our infrastructure, and it created some challenges.  We had to go back and look at--we had staff, and we had all these things going.  And so the good thing for us is in any organization, as I've seen in the Fortune 500 companies and even in one of my companies, it's not a bad thing if you catch it at the right time.  And what we did was came back, looked at our infrastructure, looked at what I need.  We downsized; we worked smarter; we looked at, again, understanding.  Like we said, all money is not good money in terms of--if I had my druthers I would not look for federal funding, having been there on the other end and understanding how it goes. 'Cause federal programs are well intentioned, but here are some we have that are very good, but some people get overzealous.  But for every organization you gotta have a strategic plan, and you gotta follow it.  But also there's no shortcut for having good quality staff, and having mature leadership on that staff, and having a board that understands their role and buys into it.  So I encourage every organization to have a strategic plan, do their assessments, do their evaluation of programs, and spread the word.  'Cause you can do, you could have the greatest program in the world, but if people don't know about it, they won't know how to duplicate it.  And that's what it's all about.  I believe in duplication.  If something works, we need to duplicate it.  If something works, we need to share it so others can use it; don't need to be proprietary about it.  If we're talking about saving lives of kids, everybody ought to know what the "secret" is.  Everybody should have the formula.   'Cause for us in the 100 [Black Men], it's not whether we get credit as being the best for mentoring kids.  It's about doing our part for saving these millions of talented, smart young kids who really deserve and need a chance and need a support base.  And so that's what I say to people, have--you gotta have visionary leaders.  You gotta have people who are willing to take a chance and people who understand you come early and stay late.  You gotta have people who build bridges, and you gotta have folks who understand that a leader is only a part of team.  And a good leader has to be a good follower.  And I--you know, I--where I am now, I a followed for years and conducted a lot of things to get to where I am.  I mean I think back when I first ran for president of 100 Black Men of Atlanta [Georgia] I lost by one vote.  I lost by one vote 'cause everybody was so confident I was gonna win the first time that too many of them didn't show up the night of the election--one vote.  One of the best things to happen, 'cause Sonny [HM William] Walker and I became closest of friends, worked as team--as a team.  And (laughter) the other good thing, we spent more time setting foundation to his administration that I was able to really soar with what I wanted to do.  But all of that's important.
Story_ID: 58935
Speaker 1: So when you look at--well, okay, one other thing I wanna ask--well, a couple of things.  I wanna know in your--someone would say your charmed life, your nurtured life-
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --Okay, have there been any real down points, and what have you learned from those?
Speaker 2: Well, there have been challenges.  I don't, I don't know about down points, 'cause I've, I've lived my life and enjoyed it, no regrets.  I have a major challenge in 1988 when they discovered I had a very rare form of cancer.  It was adenocarcinoma of the small intestine.  It's ninety-two percent mortality rate, and I'm fortunate to be here today and being in the eight percent of the survivors.  That really, I guess, was part of a wakeup call, where I was cruising along, doing what I wanted to do, making life work, about thirty-eight years old, invincible, trying to milk every second out of the day, not stopping for anything, doing everything I could to help people, and then this little wakeup call came and it started.  Thank goodness that because of health and wellness I had up until that time for seventeen consecutive years every January I'd gone for a complete physical, so I knew my body, understood when something was wrong.  And at first they thought it may have been the early stages of a little ulcer, so things continued on.  It escalated a little bit.  And I was in Paris [France] and London [United Kingdom] on vacation, and it got so bad I had to just cut it short, come back home.  And, and the doctors kept trying to--finally, they, they said, "We're putting you in the hospital.  We're running every test.  You're not getting out until we find out what's wrong."  And eventually on the second CAT scan, they found what they thought was a cyst.  I agreed to exploratory surgery, the first time I'd had any major surgery.  The only thing I'd had was tonsils taken out when I was five years old.  And low and behold they found the tumor.  It was a tumor.  They did the surgery.  I agreed to the chemotherapy, lost about eighty-two pounds and start all over.  But for me that was one of those things that make you really value life, make you really stop to think about it, but also make you assess what you've done in life.  And when I look at what happened, I mean first of all, I had so many well wishes that they had to turn my phone off, 'cause people just calling, calling, calling the hospital.  I got plants today from fourteen years ago that were sent to me that, that I got, and all of the cards, and the cards from the children and all.  So it validated for me I had done the right thing, 'cause I thought if I had taken the ex--expedient way of how much money can I make and being greedy, I probably would have been lonely.  Of course my family would have been there, but I think all of my healing that those doctors said is amazing how rapidly I recovered.  And even looking back at Sam Nunn, every week, almost every Wednesday I got that call from him checking on me to see how I was doing, I mean from across the board; and then Maynard Jackson and all of those and the friends.  That challenge made me understand a few things: one, life is not guaranteed or promised.  Like my mother told me in the hospital, she said, "Son, they will mourn you tomorrow, but they're gonna go on about their business."  So you got to be focused.  And then wanting to be there for my children, that was probably the biggest thing, looking at Thomas, who--Thomas wasn't even three, and I used to--he'd sit in my lap when I was at home after I'd lost all this weight.  And he'd, he'd point and say I want my daddy right there, and there was a picture of me when I was really healthy.  And going through that and the angel, it was like I gotta live for my children.  But even more so, it validated I'd done what I should have done as an individual.  So, that was a challenge, but it also let me know as I began to look at it and hear from people who'd been through the challenge who had never talked about it that this was another cause.  People had hidden cancer.  I'll tell everybody--I do speeches and all--that cancer is not a communicable disease, and if found early, with the progress that they made, it can--your chances for survival are there.  And I do that, and I counsel people.  I, I was--I mean it felt so important to me when Andy [HM Andrew] Young called me and asked me questions when they discovered that Jean had cancer.  And I talked with her and counseled him, 'cause Andy was first married to Carolyn.  And we got married at his home.  Jean cooked dinner for us the day we were, were married.  And we were sitting there, and it's funny.  I remember Jean when Andy [HM Andrew Young] was going through this thing, and (unclear) she saw-"Andy [HM Andrew Young] you don't know nothing about counseling folks on marriage.  Let me just sit down and do this."  I mean I, I look back at, but it was so many different people I talked to.  So I've learned to share so that others will understand that, you know, being lonely you don't have to be there.  But, again, as I look back over all the things that I've done, I understand its part of the process.  It's part of the road that was paved for me.  And would I have made different decisions?  Maybe slight on some things, but I have no regrets because God has blessed me.  I've had a wonderful life and my family, for the most part.  And unfortunately I lost my oldest brother, and my father died several years ago.  But I had the--as I tell people, I sustain my father's death by remembering all the good time and sustain my brother's death and thinking about how we used to fish and all of the things.  And I'd spend the summers with him.  So I was blessed to have had those memories and had those experiences, so you look at the blessings.  I take the whole attitude the glass is half full not half dem--half empty.  So, so as I look at all of that, and even with the challenges, I would do everything all over again, maybe tweak it a little bit.  But I don't regret life 'cause life has been good to me, and my family, and friends.
Story_ID: 58936
Speaker 1: And what do you want to do for--I mean what, what things have yet not been done by you that you'd like to do?
Speaker 2: I've made millions; I've grossed them.  I wanna start netting them, but I've done them.  My companies have done well, but I want to be able at the end of the day to look back at--I wanna make some more millionaires.  I wanna make sure that our community lives up to our fullest potential.  I don't think we should be begging anybody.  We should not be borrowed, and we should not be out here wishing and hoping things happen in our community.  We have to do it for ourselves.  And we're gonna get there not by the current generation; I think it's gonna be the future generations, but you lay the foundations today.  And the younger generations today will make a difference.  I wanna see that day where we really live up to our potential.  We've created all of these great opportunities for everybody else to make money.  We've, we've invented all of these great things for people to use from the lasting machine and everything else.  And as I said, [Thomas A.] Edison got the credit for a lot of work that we did.  We've done so many different things.  We've helped to put man on the moon and get 'em back in the outer space; we've done that.  We helped to create the atomic bomb.  We've done a little bit of everything that's helped this nation to be great, but we have not taken advantage of that.  We've made millions and billions in the recording industry, but we don't control.  We're finally beginning to get some niches in there.  So for me, I wanna be a part of helping to make our community self supportive so we can accept each other based on that level playing field.  But it's not gonna happen by people begging; it's not gonna happen by people running scare; and it's not gonna happen by people being selfish and taking what they make and running home with it.  And as [Mayor] Maynard [Jackson] said, I can get in all they can, can in all they get and sitting on it.  We got to--I believe in sharing.  I mean I write checks for so many organizations.  You give me a good cause I'm a sucker for it, because, one, I've been blessed to have the opportunity to write that check, and I could be on the other side of begging for a check.  And so I think when you spread the blessings, more blessings come back to you.  And so I want to, at the end of my lifetime, I want people to sit back and say, "Yes, Tommy Dortch did his part to build for future generations, that Tommy Dortch stood firm and stood as a man for what he believed in and for the people of our community and for all children, regardless of color, to make life better for all of them."  And I want 'em to say that I really was a bridge builder, that I helped to build bridges of understand and bring people together and not someone who tore people apart and caused people not to cooperate and work together.  And I want 'em to say I lived my life to the fullest, but I did it unselfishly; that I really did make a difference, and I think that's the important thing.  There are two definite in life: you're born, and you're gonna die.  And what you do between those two points is what matters.  And I want my whole line to be a line of meaningfulness; that I really took care of the people and did my part with all my energy.  That's why I don't worry about dancing.  I don't go to nightclubs.  I mean I'll go every now and then if I guess he wanna go.  I just see that there are better ways to use my time, and I don't condemn anybody for doing that.  I think they ought to be happy, whatever makes them happy.  But I get my joy from helping others and knowing that I'm making a difference.  You get criticized sometime, and I've been criticized by those who want what they think I have.  I got folks who think they want to have--I like being chairman of 100 [Black Men].  There are folks who want it but aren't willing to work for it.  But the good thing about our members is they recognize when you work.  And it's not--as I tell 'em, I have a portfolio before I came.  It's because I love and believe in this organization.  I believe in young people.  And I wanna make sure that when I step down that it's on cruise control; that no matter who the president--I mean who the chairman will be for this organization, there's a legacy that's in place that is solid; that the Historical Black Colleges and what I've done for the Black College Alumni Hall of Fame is gonna make a difference and helping their doors to stay open.  And even this morning from my board meeting with sic--from the Red Cross, that we're gonna address the needs of African Americans who have sickle cell, because we have to do our part in those arenas as well; and we gotta write our checks and give; and we have to be accountable.  So all of that's important to me and at--after my life is done, then I've gone on.  As I said, everybody has an ego, and I have an ego.  But as long as you use that ego to do good, it's okay.  And I hope folks will do good to fill their egos, 'cause if I do good and I satisfy my ego by doing good, I'm gonna be happy and a whole lot of other folks are gonna benefit from it.  And that's, that's important.
