Story_ID: 259412
Speaker 1: Let's begin talking first about your mother, starting with your mother's name, and where she was born and where she grew up as a girl.
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Eudora.
Speaker 1: Could you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: E-U-D-O-R-A, Elizabeth Bowman, B-O--but her maiden name--you want her maiden name?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: She was a McDaniel.  She grew up in Washington, D.C.  She was born in 1895.  She come from an old family.  She is about third generation of McDaniels and McDaniels is about the fifth generation here in Georgetown [Washington, D.C.].  She went to this church from the time she was a youngster, sang in the choir, got married around when she was about eighteen years old to Carter Bowman [Sr.] from Cropley, Maryland.  They had six children, five girls and one boy.  She spent a life time here at Mount Zion [United Methodist Church, Washington, D.C.], not only as a member but working with, with the [Women's] Society of Christian Service.  She was a secretary of, of Georgetown Civic Association--I'm sorry Rock Creek Civic Association.  Most of the time--most of her life, she was a housewife.  She didn't work in the day but she took care of house.  With five girls and a husband and, and one boy, she kept quite busy.  She had a sister Hilda [ph.] and she died kind of early in life.  So she was the oldest of the family and they all would refer to my mother, as the uncles and nieces always call her Aunt Chodor [ph.] for some reason and, and her brothers always called her Big Sissy.  Did a lot of picking on Sunday mornings and make hot rolls, do the cooking, did a lot of cooking and did all the washing and ironing so that all of us went to school.  She was very active in the, in the PTA [Parent Teacher Association].  One reason I imagine she was active because my father worked at night and but my mother outlived my father by ten years.
Speaker 1: And did she ever share any stories with you about what Washington, D.C. was like when she was a young girl and growing up in the city?
Speaker 2: Yes, not so--well they used to have dances here--well you have to know Georgetown.  Georgetown really is a, a small village and here there were quite a few Afro Americans.  I guess half the population as, were the Afro Americans, I'll say a third of the population, so everything evolved almost around this church here at Mount Zion.  Nearby there was an Odd Fellows' hall where they used to go dancing.  They did a lot of activities around the church, square dancing, Bible study, going on picnics.  She wasn't so much in the other parts of, of Mount--I mean of Washington working or connecting with other parts of Washington because most of them worked or growing up was here in Georgetown.  She seemed to have a happy life.
Story_ID: 259413
Speaker 1: How did she [Bowman's mother, Eudora McDaniel Bowman] meet your father [Carter Bowman, Sr.]?
Speaker 2: My father lived in Cropley, Maryland.  And Cropley, Maryland is in Potomac, Maryland, right off what we used to call Conduit Road and is now McArthur Boulevard.  He was--his family, his father name was Jarett Bowman and they had eighteen children but only nine lived or survived.  When he was--his father died in 1902 and his mother [Elizabeth Toney Bowman] died in 1907.  He was born in 1894.  So he--by twelve years old he was an orphan. So he--if you're--Cropley, Maryland is about, I guess about ten miles from Washington [D.C.] and what he used to do was to walk down to Cabin John [Maryland], catch a street car and then come into Georgetown [Washington, D.C.].  Generally people in that part of the Montgomery County [Maryland] they were all migrate here to Georgetown.  Georgetown being a port city and there was quite a bit of work here.
Speaker 1: So he would come here and work as a boy?
Speaker 2: He come and work as a boy. And so he met my mother and they got married.
Speaker 1: How would you describe your mother?
Speaker 2: Very quiet.  Not like the rest of us (laughter), a little shy, very good homemaker, good on her bringing up children, I thought, very good.  A good--very good worker and seen what the family looked at--looked up to her to kind of carry them through some difficult times.
Speaker 1: We started talking a little bit about your father. Let's continue talking about him a little bit.  So he would come to Georgetown and work as a boy and what else can you tell us about your father?
Speaker 2: Well, my father was kind of--you had to get to know him and I, I kind of related because he was an orphan.  He comes from a large family, as someone said when you ever talk about someone related to people up in that part of Maryland and Georgetown; you can almost trace 'em back to my father's family.  One of the things I--he was, he wasn't--he was educated.  He was a, a reader.  And I think I--we all have inherited that.  He would read a newspaper every day.  We always subscribed to the newspaper and he would sit down and read the newspaper especially on, on Sundays
Speaker 1: What newspaper?
Speaker 2: At that time it was the [Washington] Star[-News; Washington Star] and at times the [Washington] Herald. Very seldom did we take the, take the news.  But the Star was the leading paper at that time around--the [Washington] Evening Star.  My father was very good with his hands.  A good mechanic, did a lot of repairing, never did buy a new car.  He sometimes tick my mother off because he'd go out and buy an old second car and drag it on in here and work on it all the time.  He was a very good mechanic as far as when old cars with six cylinders and eight cylinders straight.  But as cars began--got more sophisticated, it required something else.  He did most of repairs around the house.  As I told you he worked at night at the [U.S.] Government Printing Office [U.S. Government Publishing Office, Washington, D.C.].  And the reason for that you got a ten percent increase in pay at night if you work other than the regular hours.
Speaker 1: And what kind of work did he do there?
Speaker 2: He had the position working with the sanitary department which is a good name and I later found out you know (laughter) what that meant.  That's where he worked at the sanitary department.  But he also drove a truck in the day time, moving people around in Georgetown, hauling trash.  He had got above it because it--before he gotten married, he--his cousin wanted him to go into the trash hauling business.  At one time, this was almost exclusively run by Afro Americans. But he decided that he had to have something that he had to depend upon because he had a family.
Story_ID: 259414
Speaker 1: We all in the family grew up in Georgetown [Washington, D.C.] with the exception of one sister and that was Catherine [Bowman].  Well I'll get back to, to my father [Carter Bowman, Sr.] in a few minutes, but Catherine went over to 24th and M Street and my father purchased a house there, a kind of run down house, but he put a lot of repairs in it.  And late years it was--went up for sale because that property changed to commercial property and so he sold it and kind of made a little bonanza.  And from that he bought the house that we in now on P Street, 2727 P Street.  He bought that house in 1927 for about seven thousand dollars.  Now the taxes on that house now is worth a million dollars or more.  So fortunately on fortunately we just kind of stayed there and so my sister is living there now.
Speaker 2: Why didn't Catherine grow up with the rest of the family in Georgetown?
Speaker 1: Well she--24th and M Street across the bridge and if you cross the bridge--the creek that you drove you're not in Georgetown, but she was, she is in Georgetown that's why everyone else when we moved back here, okay.  Now getting back to my father, not as tall as I am but very heavy neck and the shoulders, heavy in the legs.  I often wonder about him.  I knew about my mother's [Eudora McDaniel Bowman] family but I never could get close to my father as far as a family.  I heard people talking about him and I used to see some of his sisters, aunts, but he never seem to kind of gravitate to them as much.  So I-one day I began to do something in genealogy and I, I began to look up my father and I found out in 1880 census, we started 18--I mean 1900 census and I found where he was living up there in--the family was living in the property Maryland and then I went a little further and I found out that his father name was Jarret [Bowman], J-A-R-R-E-T-T, and he married a lady by the name of Elizabeth Toney.  And on the records everybody referred to her as Betsy.  As I told you they had eighteen children.  Then I wondered what about, where did this name Bowman come from?  And I began--I went up to Montgomery in Rockville [Maryland], which is a seat of, of government--
Speaker 2: Of Montgomery County?
Speaker 1: --Montgomery County and went to the library [Jane C. Sween Library, Rockville, Maryland] and they had a record of slaves' census and I went through that slave census and I definitely, I said well I don't see anything on here.  But I came back here to the church [Mount Zion United Methodist Church, Washington, D.C.] and the fellow by the name of Williams also was doing something in Montgomery County and he said to me "I thought I went looking for this record I saw a Bowman name on there."  So I went back and I--you know when you look at records and you don't find anything you kind of go down, but I went back and saw this records from Montgomery County and it was a slave records in 1867.  When Montgomery County, because it was--Maryland because it was not a slave state, they did not do a--they weren't required to have Emancipation Proclamation right away so they freed their slaves about two years after everyone else.
Story_ID: 259415
Speaker 1: And in turning through these slave records, I ran into the name--I saw the name Jarrett [Bowman], and I saw a lady by the name of Phyllis [ph.] Bowman and she was owned by the Thrift family.  Then there were Phyllis and I think she had a daughter named Mary [ph.] and then there was Jarrett.  And they had the last name of Bowman.  So often you don't see the last name.  So I went back and found out that that person who was in charge of this was the name of Thrift.  She was a lady and as I said before women didn't own slaves as such unless they were generally handed down by will or left by some family by a dowry.  So I found--I went and looked up Thrift and found out that he had died and he left a will.  And on this will I saw Phyllis where she was a slave and what really kind of just I'm just sitting there just I think I've been blown away.  Because beside that will, I mean beside that slave they had for, for life. In other words, if they hadn't come on they would have been a slave for life.
Speaker 2: And was Phyllis, Jarrett's mother?
Speaker 1: Phyllis was Jarrett's mother.
Speaker 2: So Phyllis was your great-grandmother.
Speaker 1: Great-grandmother.
Speaker 2: And Jarrett was your grandfather.
Speaker 1: And the owner of slave she was forty years old.  And I have never seen anything on her as such but by just doing the math and I got her figure.  This, this was just, just--I just sat there and just I couldn't hardly move then I saw that part about being a slave for life.  Then I went to the Montgomery County Historical [Society, Rockville, Maryland] department and while I was there, the lady gave me a background on the Thrift family.  I still haven't seen her husband, but all of 'em were named Bowmans but I still don't see a man anywhere. And so when I was in Montgomery Historical Society, the lady also said--told me about Catholics in Montgomery County [Maryland] and she pulled out a records of eight Catholic churches.  These churches are no more in operation but they had the records of all the baptisms, the marriages, when they were born and also beside one of the young ladies that got married, they had a Charles Bowman, her husband of Phyllis.  I still haven't found anything on Charles Bowman.  The--one of the leads that I been trying a couple of leads, I think that Charles came up Potomac River from Charles County, Maryland.  And because it was a rule that they worked on the railroad, I mean worked on the river, would come up the river, up Potomac River and get off the boat one way or the other and begin to work in Montgomery County. The lady that he married, that my great-grandmother came from Charles County and I haven't followed it up but down in Charles County there is a kind of a, a lot of Bowmans are there.  So I hope to follow that through, I mean. But my father [Carter Bowman, Sr.], because I think he was an orphan, he had kind of and everyone else except his brother, who came here in Georgetown [Washington, D.C.], there were ladies and they, they used their survival skills, I'll put it that way.  They were entrepreneurs and they could kind of take care of themselves.
Speaker 2: Your aunts, your father's sisters?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Father's sisters and my aunts also.  They, they used all the skills that they possessed and they were here in Georgetown and he would go to see them every now but they had, they had their entrepreneurs businesses and he would go by--
Speaker 2: What kind of business did they have?
Speaker 1: Well, they, they how can I put it?  They were certain survival skills they here in Georgetown, they had businesses of I guess lottery, I'll put it lottery. And in that time, during Prohibition, they would also have a business of taking care of selling, have a nice house I think good to have a house okay. And they--I don't think some of them got married.  Some didn't.  But they, they were well thought of in the community as far as I think went to church and what not but all the--they knew how to survive. But he would keep up with them but not as much as my--everyone would always come by and tell me about my aunt and uncles.  A lot of them were up in Montgomery County and a lot of them settled here.
Story_ID: 259416
Speaker 1: Let me ask you [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Carter] Bowman, what is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: My earliest memory of growing up was here in--going to school here in [Wendell] Phillips School [Washington, D.C.].  Phillips School was a school about two blocks from here, elementary school, and going there that's, that's some of my earliest memories.
Story_ID: 259417
Speaker 1: Can you kind of tell us a little bit about what family life was like for you growing up?  What was a typical day like for you, as a boy you'd wake up in the morning and?
Speaker 2: Wake up in the morning, have breakfast.  We always ate breakfast.  Everyone sat down and ate breakfast and it wasn't no getting up and of course my father [Carter Bowman, Sr.] he would probably he might be up at that time but he'd work at night and maybe he'd get up early and do some work around the house, get dressed.  I remember on P Street [Washington, D.C.] mainly there were--I was the only boy so I had the room by myself.  But all the girls had a room.  My sisters shared, shared had a room.  Then I would probably go to school.  In the summer time, I go down to the playground.  There was a playground about two blocks from here called Rose Park Playground [Washington, D.C.] and most of the boys would go there and play around on the playground.
Speaker 1: What games did you play?
Speaker 2: Played baseball, hide and seek.  One of the games that as I got a little older that was very prominent and I haven't seen it any place in Georgia--any place other than in Georgetown [Washington, D.C.], it was a form a game called I Spy.  You ever heard of I Spy?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well this was a game by, with the young men and they were to meet at night time in the evening on the corner, on a lot.  In Georgetown we kind of ruled that in that sense.  And they would divide themselves up into teams.  And one team would go out with, with one member, no I'm sorry, the team would go out and they would hide themselves and then they would send one of their captains back and he would sit down and draw a diagram on--in the ground where these people might be.  And then the second team would go out looking for these people, these people.  Along with that was the captain of the first team and as they would look at the map, they would go.  Connecting with Mount Zion [United Methodist Church, Washington, D.C.] is a cemetery [Mount Zion Cemetery, Washington, D.C.].  Sometimes you would hide behind the cemetery behind the tombstones.  When this team approached the team that was hiding, their captain would say you know "Home sheep run."  Okay that's the name of the game is Home Sheep Run.  And they would try to beat the other team back to the base.  If they got back in time first, then they would go out and hide again.  But with the team that is looking from--for this idea I should say, they had the captain from that hide and as this other team got close to them, if you saw them first he would say, "I spy black sheep."  If he say, "I spy black sheep," then everybody had to run and the first person got back.  This was very exciting.  That's one of the favorite games that we used to play.  The other one shoot marbles.  I don't see marbles being shot now.  We used to shoot marbles at night time we collect marbles.
Speaker 1: Were you pretty good at shooting marbles?
Speaker 2: Fair.  (Laughter)  And in this area one of the things that we had that was right across the creek was a swimming pool, Francis Swimming Pool [Washington, D.C.], and so we all, we'd go over there in the morning and, and learn how to swim. I had some cousins who lived, they were my--mother [Eudora McDaniel Bowman] had--her sister had all boys and so I would kind of gravitate to them and their name was Hinton [ph.].  And she had the oldest son he was quite, quite good on with his hands and he used to make scooters.  He used to make scooters out of roller skates and he also would make wagons and ride down the hills over here.  And then we would go also down the creek [Rock Creek] along we would go hiking quite a bit and this was one of the things, it was just a joyful time over here.
Story_ID: 259418
Speaker 1: Could you give us your siblings' names and their birth order, including yourself, so just starting with the oldest their names?
Speaker 2: The oldest girl, Marjorie McField Bowman.  She was born in 1914.  Then Evelyn Bowman, she, she was born I think 1915 or '16 [1916], I'm not sure.  Then Doris Elizabeth Bowman.  Those two, other two they're dead now.  And Doris is still living.  She was born in 1919.  Then I came next in 1922 and then Catherine Dora Bowman was born in 1923 December.  I didn't give you the dates did I?
Speaker 1: No that's okay, that's fine.
Speaker 2: December 23rd, and then Constance Antoinette Bowman, when she was a baby, she was born in 1927.  She was a baby.  She died early in life.
Story_ID: 259419
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Carter] Bowman, tell me what sights, sounds and smells remind you of your childhood and remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: My mother [Eudora McDaniel Bowman] cooking bread early on Sunday morning. The smell of, in Georgetown [Washington, D.C.] it used to be a rendering plant that took all the fats, collected all of the fats from the grocery store and they used rend that from Hopfenmaier [Washington, D.C.]. They made up fats when they render the fat.  In the evening time you could smell that smell over Georgetown, just kind of not--just kind of peculiar.
Speaker 1: Wasn't there a flour mill [Wilkins Rogers Mills] in Georgetown?
Speaker 2: There's a flour mill here down on K Street also all down that area very industrial.  The sound of fire engines.  One of the great things I used to remember, I used to like to go to parades and September on Labor Day, parade on Pennsylvania Avenue where all the fire--they call it a firemen parade, fire engines would come from all areas around.  They would turn on their sirens.  The sound of my uncle playing the piano and singing and that was one of the things. He played by ear and he called my, my mother Big Sissy. Smells of just, just the smell of fresh air. Rain and snow, eating snow, taste of the snow we used to go and make ourselves a snow.  The snow would fall and we would make something like ice--something like ice cream okay.
Speaker 1: How did you make it?  How did you make it, did you take fresh snow, what else?
Speaker 2: You take it and you put some milk with it and a little vanilla.  The smell of my father [Carter Bowman, Sr.] because we came from a large family he would--and the sound of killing chickens, fresh chickens, when he used to take 'em out in the yard and the chicken used to cluck, you hear the chicken clucking when he would kind of take him, put 'em on a chopping block and smell of and just the cool water the way this family home was they had a big old crib beside the oak tree they had a, a little, I guess a well, it came naturally out of the ground, just as cool and crisp in the summer time.  These are just a part of--my mother cooking strawberry shortcake, and then my father taste of my father making ice cream, old hand grown ice cream.  And this time of year he'd make eggnog.  That's one of the things we had just to get back to my father when he came down from Maryland before we got working for the government down on 15th Street near the [U.S. Department of the] Treasury.  There used to be a lot of saloons there and they used to make eggnog this time of year for the saloon, make it by the five gallon cans. And so he would--just a taste of him making eggnog from at home every Christmas Eve, he would go make eggnog from scratch, I mean from scratch, okay (laughter).
Story_ID: 259420
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit now about your elementary school, you mentioned that the [Wendell] Phillips School [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: School, yeah elementary schools yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All the family went to--
Speaker 1: --do you remember some of your teachers there?
Speaker 2: I can see them but I can't, can't remember their names.
Speaker 1: That's okay.  What were some of your favorite subjects in elementary school?
Speaker 2: I always interested in, in geography and history.  When I know I didn't like, I used to have a little trouble in I guess speaking but the, then the speech teacher used to come around.  I used to hate to go (laughter), go to speech.  I can't recall too much.  One of my favorite subjects in elementary school.
Speaker 1: What kind of student were you in elementary school?
Speaker 2: Just an average student. My mother [Eudora McDaniel Bowman] said I was much, when she carried me down to, along with her to see about one of my sisters at school and this--I guess at a meeting and one of the teachers told her, the kindergarten teacher says I'm such a large boy, tall boy for my age.  She said I can start kindergarten early.  So I went--I started school a year earlier than everyone else and just average.  One of the things I liked they had the school boy patrol that used to stand on the corners and used to have a little badge and in my last year I was captain of the school boy patrol.  And every June I think or May, they had the school boy patrol from all neighboring you know they would come here and watch and march down Pennsylvania Avenue.  They even dress up, have floats and you have your little badge on and then sometimes you'd dress up like sailors, have our little white hats on, and white pants and dressed in which, we couldn't wear today they said.  (Laughter)  And you go sweater and we would walk from Constitution Avenue down to pass the--at the eclipse, eclipse [sic. ellipse] behind the White House [Washington, D.C.] and this was something we look forward to every year, as I was the captain, I took great care in that.
Speaker 1: Could girls be patrols?
Speaker 2: I don't think girls at that time they were, but girls in later years were (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 259421
Speaker 1: --What kind of little boy were you?
Speaker 2: Just an average little boy.  I, I--
Speaker 1: Were you mischievous or?
Speaker 2: If you talk to some women they say I have five sisters, they say I was spoiled.  (Laughter)  But (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Were you?
Speaker 2: --I don't know about that.  If there were any my mother [Eudora McDaniel Bowman] would take care of us in the summer--in the day time what not, but if there were--if we got into any kind of trouble maybe we might do something my father [Carter Bowman, Sr.] was the one who would really put the stuff on you, if he got hold of you.  And that--this was he would get this little switch, he'd get this we call it, he had a little belt, he would lay on you a little bit.  You couldn't do that nowadays.  You'll probably be called, they'll have you down for but he would, he would be the one--my mother turned you over to your father then you knew you were going to be a, be a stern buff.
Speaker 1: What was it like growing up in a house with five sisters?
Speaker 2: It was very nice.  One of the things I learned how to dance.  In those days we always had a piano and someone would--well my sister was a little older so we was always, they used to have dances at home at certain times they would have dances.  So I, I learned how to dance.  And Doris [Bowman] who is a little older than I am well I mean just about three years difference, Doris was very good at the take--or making things for children.  Behind our house was an alley and every fall--every summer, Doris would put on, on a carnival.  She would make things like pin the donkey and she would invite all the neighborhood and it was very, very, very, very fine thing she did. I say Doris was a teacher only thing she could do was hold a pencil.  (Laughter)  But she was good at that.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: But Evelyn [Bowman] was a little older and Margie [Marjorie McField Bowman] was the oldest.  Margorie was--where I got my tales from my grandfather.  He tell me more about what my grandfather and my father, she had a quite a bit of understanding.  Just before she passed I got a tape from her and then she related it to--My father and them had this property up in Montgomery County [Maryland] and as I told you he kind of separated himself from the family.  He never bothered about it and as long as the other girls paid the taxes on it and what not and he just wasn't, he wasn't interested.  He would go up there and we would go up there and what not but he left everything--all that to them.  I imagine it was a kind of a struggle maybe for taking care all of us.  See that we all went to school.  We all carried lunches to school.  We all had little bags--brown bags.  I think I carried a brown bag lunch until I left high school [Samuel Chapman Armstrong Technical High School; Armstrong Manual Training School, Washington, D.C.].  (Laughter)  But elementary school [Wendell Phillips School, Washington, D.C.] was nice but really I kind of begin to blossom when I went to junior high school [Francis Junior High School; School Without Walls at Francis-Stevens, Washington, D.C.].
Story_ID: 259422
Speaker 1: And what was the name of the junior high school?
Speaker 2: Francis Junior High School [School Without Walls at Francis-Stevens, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Which is still in existence today?
Speaker 2: Still in existence right across the creek there.  When people--we were kind of contained here in Georgetown [Washington, D.C.].  Everybody bringing up younger, when you got a little older and you finish junior high school--when you finish high--elementary school, you went to Francis Junior High School.  And this is where people came from I think the border line was 16th Street, bringing up to Florida Avenue and then we had a lot of children who came here from Virginia because Virginia didn't have any elementary schools in that area.  But--
Speaker 1: For blacks?
Speaker 2: --black, black schools, that's right.  Um-hm. But this was a new thing.  About a couple of weeks ago about a month ago, I went to a funeral of the first male teacher I ever had and he was a gym teacher over at Francis, Wilford Jackson [ph.].  I think he was about a hundred--I think Wilford was 101 years old, but he was--and so that was the first male teacher that I had.  Junior high school was different, very good principal, very good school, very--a lot of activities that you could relate to.  I learned how to play soccer there in those years when probably because of the physical plan of Francis had a lot, had a quarter mile track, had a field around under--around--I mean the track was surrounded by a field when we played soccer and this gym teacher had arranged each section into a league and you would play in this league and a round robin and then she involved us in going getting the principal involved and getting the PTA [Parent Teacher Association].  It was an excellent school, excellent school.
Speaker 1: And tell me a little bit about what subjects you enjoyed most in junior high school.
Speaker 2: In junior high school we say something that I don't think they do it now days when you, especially for the boys, when you went in in the seventh grade you took woodwork.  Incidentally my mother [Eudora McDaniel Bowman] still has a little shelf that I made around the house there and a broom holder that we made.  And from there you went to electricity.  I been talking to someone the other day one of the friends I talk to every now and then he was saying how he took electricity in junior high school and we talked about taking these, splicing these things together with the western union and the, and the rat tail splice.  We learned how to use it, had a appreciation for electricity.

Speaker 1: In the ninth--in eighth grade, I went to the print shop which influenced my life forever.
Speaker 2: How so?
Speaker 1: Just working in the print shop.  The, the smell of the ink; just to put the type on paper, a very good teacher by the name of Jeremiah Green [ph.].  And over at Francis [Junior High School; School Without Walls at Francis-Stevens, Washington, D.C.] they had something that was unique.  They had a small newspaper called [The Francis] Magnet.  It was mostly was a four page, a four page edition eight and a half by eleven.  All the news was written by the children which was an exercise in English.  They had a business manager.  They sold it for two cents apiece.  All the printing was set by hand by the boys in the print shop; run off.  It was an excellent learning tool.  And I worked at the print shop and I was a printer and I decided in the ninth grade to specialize--I mean--I specialized in printing.  But, but along with that in the ninth grade, of course I played athletics there at Francis.  I--we had team--basketball team and naden [ph.] basketball and I played with them.  I wasn't a great basketball player (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Just had the height, huh?
Speaker 1: I had the height.
Speaker 2: Why was the print shop so influential in your life do you think?
Speaker 1: Well because when I left Francis, I went to [Samuel Chapman] Armstrong Technical [High] School [Armstrong Manual Training School, Washington, D.C.].  I took printing there.  It was fair.  You have to--well I'll get back to Francis.  When I left Fran--and graduating from Francis and because I had never missed a day in school, never been late, they gave a-PTA [Parent Teacher Association] gave a scholarship to camp.  And was my first time away from home and they called it Camp Ditchman [ph.] out in, in the mountains of Blue Ridge Mountains.  I spent two weeks, two months--two weeks there.  It--I learned how to get over home sickness.  I learned how to eat other people's food.  And it was quite experience.  And I met some people that I, I later kept in touch with all my life.  And then when I graduated because I hadn't missed any days in school and seemed like I had a pretty good character, that year the American Legion gave their first American Legion [School] Award [Medal] for scholarship, honesty and bravery and what not.  And I was the first recipient of the American Legion Award in junior high school.  And so I still have that award and so that, that was quite an honor.  I began to study a little bit more in school.  I began to like different subjects.  I particularly liked civics.  And I had an English teacher, Mrs. Peyton [ph.], she was very, very good.  She would like boys, so she always had the knuckleheads (laughter).  She could handle 'em.
Story_ID: 259424
Speaker 1: When you were in junior high school, who were you being influenced by?
Speaker 2: I, I guess it was Mr., Mr. [Jeremiah] Green [ph.] and just a, just a whole--and Ms. Peyton [ph.].  I began to play basketball, try to play basketball and during that time there was a fellow over in growing up and they called him Moose Fletcher [ph.].  Moose lived near Francis [Junior High School; School Without Walls at Francis-Stevens, Washington, D.C.] and he lived on the basketball court.  He was ahead of his times, way ahead of his times.  This was an era where a lot of fellas didn't ever finish school.  Athletes I saw excellent athletes, and (unclear) and excellent swimmers.  At Francis Junior High School had a fella named Maurice Jackson [ph.] he used to swim.  One of the things that people from, I like to say people without color never realize that certain things were going on in our community and we weren't all just working.  There were certain activities that was going on.  One was swimming at a swimming pool.  Other was tennis.  Because around this neighborhood the Peter sisters [Margaret Peters and Matilda Roumania Peters] came out and they were, they were, they were before the Williams sisters [Venus Williams and Serena Williams].
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay they, they worked and then Maurice Jackson and we still had tennis matches, I mean swimming matches between Baltimore [Maryland] and New York [New York].  So there, there was a life going on besides this okay (laughter).
Story_ID: 259425
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about your family's experiences in church.
Speaker 2: Okay, but I wanted to get there, go to church, but I'll get back to high school [Samuel Chapman Armstrong Technical High School; Armstrong Manual Training School, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Yes, sir, we'll talk about church and then we'll come back to high school.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.  Well my--
Speaker 1: Did everybody attend?
Speaker 2: Everybody attended.  We all were going to attend Sunday school.  I told you my mother [Eudora McDaniel Bowman] went to church and I was doing some research here in 1820.  This church split from the white church in 1816, Dumbarton [United Methodist Church, Washington, D.C.], and formed their own church.
Speaker 1: Which is Mount Zion [United Methodist Church, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Mount Zion.  But not here, this is the second church other church is about two blocks from here.  It got kind of dilapidated and large number of people were attending so they moved here in 1880.  But from the records of 1820 there's a lady by the name of Chloe McDaniels [ph.] and I have to do further research.  When I talked to the man for the records down in Washington [D.C.], he gets McDaniel around 1804 here in Georgetown [Washington, D.C.] and they had that manumission papers and they had their freedom papers.  Having made the connection as such and sometimes you had to be very careful because you get thrown by things.  They got called them mulattos.  But from what I see of my great-grandfather he wasn't a mulattos (laughter).  That doesn't mean much.  Well any how getting back to the church here, we all took an active part in the church.  They, they were in the junior choir.  They were--the girls were into the, they don't call them BYPU [Baptist Young People's Union], they call them Nef the Youth [ph.].  They had organizations in the club here.  They all worked in, in the church.  Now I can't--I'll have to admit, I came to Sunday school but when I left Sunday school I would leave Sunday school, very seldom attend church, and I would head for the playground.  Now my mother would attend church every Sunday.  She was active, she was active, she used to recruit for the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], she was over--she was a stewardess and a stewardess in a Methodist church they serve communion.  My father [Carter Bowman, Sr.] very seldom attend church. He been busy working on the car.  But I never will forget one of the pastors came around and saw my father said oh, so he told him he said "Oh, you Mr. Bowman?"  Say, "I never met you, but any man who send their, their, what he say, send their lambs to church all right with me."  Now it wasn't until, well I'm the historian of the church and I began to look at some records and I found that 1917 or just after my--before my--just after my mother got married, they had a pastor here was from New Orleans [Louisiana] named Turpo [ph.].  And he was a great one on puttin on pageants.  And he put on one of his favorite pageants where the, where the ten or twenty elders and he had all the women, the women had to have a man or get somebody from somewhere to march with and I saw where my, my father was a member of the church and he was marching, but I guess as the years went on he began. But after he retired, he came back here to church and began to work at church again.
Story_ID: 259426
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about the history of this church, Mount Zion [United Methodist Church, Washington, D.C.].  You said that it split off.
Speaker 2: Yes, well history--around 1800 [Richard] Allen who was up in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] was in a Methodist church [St. George's Methodist Episcopal Church; Historic St. George's United Methodist Church, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and he was up in the balcony which here most of the churches that time had balcony.  And the balcony was occupied by Afro Americans.  And he couldn't participate in the communion services any way.  So one Sunday he decided to come down and participate.  For ramifications of it and what not he left the Methodist church and formed his own church A.M.E. African Methodist Episcopal Church around 1800s.  Well about that time, along the Atlantic seaboard here Washington [D.C.], New York [New York], Philadelphia, Baltimore [Maryland] what not, there was a movement of people Afro Americans to kind of learn more about and get their own freedom and the same thing happened to Mount Zion. In Dumbarton [United Methodist Church, Washington, D.C.], they were sitting up in the balcony they had they own collection and what not.  And they began--
Speaker 1: So it was almost like two churches within one church (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Two churches in one.  Okay.  They decided to kind of go for themselves.  And so in this white church, there was a man by the name of [Henry] Foxhall.  Foxhall was--he was a--had money.  He was, he had made his fortune by having, making guns for, for, for the, for the war, Revolutionary War, and anyhow he also a member of the African Colonization Society, which wanted to send Africans back to Liberia.  So that was that movement.  So he just bought this property on 26th Street in a preference for Afro Americans to set up their own church.  After taking up the money, about 125 people decided to go from Dumbarton church at that time was called Georgetown Station and to start their own church.  And they started they own church there, wherein Allen formed his own church with the Afro Americans being the pastor and what not.  We decided not to leave the Methodist church.
Speaker 1: So Allen formed the A.M.E. branch?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh with black preachers and what not.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But Allen said he had learned to read while he was in the Methodist church and the Methodist church was good to him.  He would always remain a Methodist. Then after Allen came or left there was a man [John Jamison Moore] I think someone came along I think it was oh, I can't think of his name now, he formed the A.M.E. Zion Church a couple of years after that.  And there's an A.M.E., that's the African Methodist Episcopal and the A.M.E. African Methodist Zion Church.  Okay.  But they all branches of Methodism.  They take a lot from Methodist.  We decided to stay with the Methodist church at that time because Methodist Episcopal Church all right we formed our own church there but from 1816 until 1864 we were always under the sponsorship of the other church.  We didn't have any black, black preachers or Afro American preachers.  Around 1842, well let me say this, Mount Zion prospered.  People--when people would come here trying to escape and what not, trying to run away, come here to Washington because I told you it was a port city, plenty of work here.  They, they prospered.  It was a meeting house, they call a meeting house.  They would, people would come there and they would meet, had a rapport with the people in the, in the city and what not.
Speaker 1: There was a stop on the Underground Railroad (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --as well?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Not this church, but the older church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the cemetery [Mount Zion Cemetery, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Right, the initial church?
Speaker 2: The initial church.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 259427
Speaker 1: So they decided to move here and buy this church [Mount Zion United Methodist Church, Washington, D.C.] here in 1880.  Before they could build this church here, they had the fire in the old church, but they built this church.  Now this church, the young man when he came they said it looking beautiful but this church the main purpose of this church or the main I guess thing about this church it's not any great piece of architecture, but most of the work here were done by those freed slaves or those person who were indentured servants.  Right after the Civil War, there were a lot of people who came here from Virginia with some good skills, carpenters and what not.  And so they came here and began to do the work on this church.  And then we had a pastor here by the name of Dennison [ph.] and he brought in some good skills and they did the wainscoting there, they, the eventure, everything in this church right here now is original.  There has nothing has been changed.  Because we are under the [U.S. Commission of] Fine Arts, you cannot change anything on the outside without getting permission.  And I'm gonna you just a little history of, of what happened why we can't change.  Georgetown [Washington, D.C.] is under the fine arts commission and we have to get permission from them and we're also in Georgetown, also covered by the Georgetown restoration committee.  About I guess about thirty years ago, because of these windows have a lot of air going out of them and trustees decided they want to change the windows and they couldn't get permission.  They had to get permission from the arts--fine arts commission.  The person from the fine art commission came in and the trustee was here and they came in the door way.  And as you come in the door way, the main doorway, you will see a stained glass there.  And as the trustee was ahead walking up the steps, this man stopped from the commission and he said "Oh, these windows are priceless."  And so he knew right then he couldn't do anything with these windows.  These windows are not the ornate windows that you will find in some places with the different parts of the--these are stained glass made by a man from Czechoslovakia [Czech Republic and Slovakia] from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  He began to make windows like this.  And they are known as comfort windows.  Just as you would come in from a hard day's work out here coming having no place to stay or what not, they would come in here and just sit and just be kind of comfortable.
Story_ID: 260601
Speaker 1: He [U.S. Commission of Fine Arts representative] said they were comfort windows?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Now one of the things at one time we had a large congregation here [Mount Zion United Methodist Church, Washington, D.C.] but now in Georgetown [Washington, D.C.] as you know there--after 1945 this whole area began to change.
Speaker 1: How did it change?
Speaker 2: When the Democrats came in they began to look at the houses here.  Houses were kind of run down.  They were kind of dilapidated.  They were older houses, but the structure of the houses were very, very good.  So they--Georgetown where it's located, you're not that far from the White House [Washington, D.C.], you can walk to the White House, you can walk to the state department [U.S. Department of State], it's very accessible for to get into what we call the City of Washington, D.C.  And they looked at these homes and they decided they have a lot of historical background to them and the people decided they want to move in these homes and begin to renovate them, restore them and to move in.  There's a lot of history behind the homes.  And then a lot of people here in Georgetown didn't own their homes, not only in Georgetown but the whole City of Washington.  We just beginning, that's another story, we just beginning to own property as such.  And so the only person who did own homes, they couldn't get--come up to code.  Because it's an old part of town, they were a lot of outhouses and a lot of code violations.  And so you couldn't get money to--from the banks.  So they sold their homes and moved out.  The homes were restored and as I told you one of the things I like to say about a fella just about 1945 or 1950 on the playground, they had a bas--a baseball team one summer that won the city championship and they had a nice squad.  At the end of the next year, they couldn't have enough young men to form a team.  And so--
Speaker 1: So many had moved out?
Speaker 2: --all moved out.  People moved away from Georgetown.  Some people who were--had property here they began to you know people began to offer them some money, they began to move because everyone been living up near Howard University [Washington, D.C.] what that part they call up on the hill where there was much more night life and living and so people began to sell homes in Georgetown.  And now we at one time we had about five hundred people or parishioners.  At one time as far as eight hundred people here in Georgetown that I know of and I just about know just about everyone.  There's only one family, and that's my sister, who goes to church here that lives in Georgetown.  Everyone else lives other than Georgetown. And so on Sunday to get parking space like you got today is at a premium and we have two vans that bring--pick up people. But it's an old congregation.  We have a new pastor here, Robert E. Slade.  He's bringing in younger people.  The order of service has changed, where we used to sing known for his choir singing anthems and four part melody or what not, it's not that way now.
Speaker 1: How is it now?
Speaker 2: We have a praise service in the morning and the girls yelp they sing and you know we hold our hands up and we say amen, give God's praises.  We have organ, but we don't have an organist as such now.  So times have changed.   So but we have about 275 people, oh I say about 250.
Speaker 1: What happened with the windows?
Speaker 2: What happened to the windows?
Speaker 1: Was the church able to replace the windows?
Speaker 2: The church was able to get them restored. I know that certain parts.  If you look at the windows and look in the back, it look like they're, they're little jewels back there.  And this person from Czechoslovakia [Czech Republic and Slovakia] and it looked like it's a fan back there, he has a way of dropping red stain down and this was his hallmark of, of doing these windows.  The windows still need some repair and need to be taken care of restoring--restorations so this was a part of our other project.

Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit, we had began talking about high school, [Samuel Chapman] Armstrong Technical [High] School [Armstrong Manual Training School, Washington, D.C.]. When you were in high school, what were some of your thoughts about college?
Speaker 2: Well, I knew my sister [Doris Bowman] went to, she graduated high school and she went to Miner's Teachers College [sic. Miner Teachers College; University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.].  My other two sisters didn't.  They came out during the [Great] Depression, which play a found--had an effect on them.  In that group I was telling the pastor he had most of them look on the records very few of the ladies got married and because they wasn't gonna take that chance because of men jobs were hard to come by.  And then right after that what happened that my sister them they went on to did domestic work, working for babysitting, working for men what not, working for bachelors and admin jobs because it doesn't seem plausible that this happened, but two people in the family couldn't hold a government job.  And this was the biggest industry in Washington [D.C.].  My father worked for the [U.S.] Government Printing Office [U.S. Government Publishing Office, Washington, D.C.].  That meant that my sisters couldn't apply or they applied but they couldn't get a job.  So a lot of the men, the other man lived next to me, his wife was a teacher.  So he left, left his job and did something else.  He was a butler and what not.
Story_ID: 260603
Speaker 1: I went to junior high, I went to high school.  I was--I played a little basketball, but my main thing was football.  Because we over here in Georgetown [Washington, D.C.] because there was a big lot available down at playground, we all had a football team.  And we would play among one another.  And then in my early years when I was in Francis [Junior High School; School Without Walls at Francis-Stevens, Washington, D.C.], we used to do--we used to play touch football, which I found out it was very valuable in my growing up.  We weren't tackling but we learned how to run and of course I never was on the winning team because we had guys who were small and much more quick on foot than I was but it gave me the idea it taught me how to run and how to--and I began to look at the football team.  And then when I was there--went down to [Samuel Chapman] Armstrong [Technical High School; Armstrong Manual Training School, Washington, D.C.], I majored in printing.  Now Armstrong is a technical school.  One of the three high schools here in Washington [D.C.].  There was [Paul Laurence] Dunbar [High School, Washington, D.C.] which was right across from Armstrong, Cardozo [Senior High School; Cardozo Education Campus, Washington, D.C.] and Armstrong.  There were no high schools in Virginia.  Montgomery County [Maryland] had only one and Virginia had one in their up in one of the counties so most of the people from those areas came in here to Washington school even from South Carolina and other places.  But I found high school was very crowded.  We had a little more lead way of going to school.  A lot of people dropped out.  I was kind of young going to school.  Jimmy [ph.] dropped out at sixteen didn't have to go to school.  A lot of guys got lost leaving Francis because sometime you have a good situation or nice situation when you go to another situation where you maybe have more, I'll put it this way, more freedom to make choices you sometimes you get lost and, and you have to make your own choices.  So a lot of fellas did drop out of high school, but I stayed in high school and I took printing.  It was nice, but not what Francis.  I loved football.  And my first year I did not go out for football.  I wanted to go out but there weren't that many people going to high school from Francis that I knew are from Georgetown and I went there and I began to-- I watch the team practice and I didn't practice that year.  But I got--I was in the drill team and they had ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps].  And so I put my emphasis on ROTC and in my studies.  Had some good teachers.  My second year I began to--I went out for football and before I--that first year when I was there we had a little what we call a sandlot team over here in Georgetown and we went over and played the fellas from Francis Junior High School from Francis and for some reason or another I played center and I enjoyed it on the team.  And when I went to Armstrong I--my second year I went out for center on the football team.  It was quite an experience.  I was kind of much younger than the other people when I went there.  I think I was around fourteen years old when I went there.
Speaker 2: And so did you play football throughout high school?
Speaker 1: Throughout high school, two years uh-huh.
Story_ID: 260604
Speaker 1: Were you thinking that you were-that you wanted to go to college?
Speaker 2: During that time, there was--and I used to come to Georgetown Library [Washington, D.C.], and there was book out called 'Navy Blue and Gold [: A Story of the Naval Academy,' George Bruce].  It was about football and Navy [U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland].  I also began to read about Paul Robeson.  And I used to read about Paul Robeson how he was in up the Rutgers [College; Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey] and how he made All-American.  I used to read about Paul Robeson and I began to think about college.  And during that time I think there was one fella up to--from Chicago [Illinois] at the University of Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois], by the name of Bernie Jefferson [Lawrence Bernard Jefferson].  He was about one of the few Afro Americans in white school and later on there was a fella in Pennsylvania named Brud Hawk--no Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York] named Brud Holland [Jerome H. Holland].  He was one of the few athletes and football players.  I began to look at football.  I like the game.  My first coach was a coach by the name of Harry C. Graves.  He went to school in Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan], early Afro American.  And he was a former coach at Wilberforce University [Wilberforce, Ohio], very good coach and it was very interesting.  I met people from other part of the town and--
Speaker 1: So how did you make the decision to--that you would go to Tuskegee [Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: That's very--this was--I met a fella there from a different part of town from southeast Washington [D.C.].  If you want to put it very opposite than myself, I came from a family.  My father [Carter Bowman, Sr.], ate dinner, sat down ate dinner at six o'clock in the evening.  I'd get that whistle come on home and we sat down and eat dinner.  We have breakfast on Sunday mornings, evening we all be around the house, discuss things, argue (laughter) and then had breakfast.  This relative was from southeast Washington, a boy of the streets.  I mean he had a mother kind of, aunts, they all lived together in apartment but a hell of a athlete named Lee Shore [ph.].  Lee Shore was a senior but he had never played football at [Samuel Chapman] Armstrong [Technical High School; Armstrong Manual Training School, Washington, D.C.].  He played on a sandlot team called Lincoln ACs [ph.], had all the skills of anyone.  We made--we got to be friends.  Lee Shore was a great athlete, took school not very seriously.  A boy in the street knew how to make money and he made it, I guess what we call it illegally by gambling.  He could--school, Armstrong because it was so loose I guess because you can make it he and a fella from down the bottom we call him "Onion," Wallace Gentry [ph.].  They used to get together.  One would shoot.  The other one would bet.  And they go up around Hal Theater [ph.] where all the action was and they come back with loads of money.  They, they were good at it.  And when Shore began to play football and I kinda got in with Shore and then and he went to Tuskegee.  And because Harry C. Graves was at Wilberforce, we used to play Tuskegee and he knew the coach there.  And in my last--when Shore went to Tuskegee, my last year in school Shore came home from Tuskegee with white pants on, his red t-shirt with a T on it.  And I began to kind of hang out with him in the summer time.  I used to go down there and what not.  Before then I was going to Hampton [Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] or Lycoming [Williamsport Dickinson Seminary and Junior College; Lycoming College, Williamsport], Pennsylvania because I, I wanted to play a little football.  But around August, I guess around July, I decided I wanted to go Tuskegee and that helped to change my mind.
Story_ID: 260605
Speaker 1: But prior to that, when we were in the football games down at [Samuel Chapman] Armstrong [Technical High School; Armstrong Manual Training School, Washington, D.C.] because we were on the football team, Howard University [Washington, D.C.] used to let us come to the football games on Saturdays.  So in the fall of the year, we went up to a football game at the homecoming of Howard University and the team they were playing was Tuskegee [Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  Tuskegee had just had been on a tour, they going to Tennessee [Agricultural and Industrial] State [College; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee].  Left there went up to Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio], not Wilberforce in Chicago [Illinois].  They had a big game in Chicago every year at Soldiers Field [sic. Soldier Field, Chicago, Illinois] at Wilberforce, and they left Wilberforce and came down to Howard.  They had the band with them.  They looked good.  They put on a good show, they had a terrific team.  By half time, I mean by the fourth quarter the coach had sent a starting team in and his name was Major Cleve L. Abbott [Cleveland Leigh Abbott] and that kind of influenced my remember all those things so I began to work on Tuskegee, trying to go to Tuskegee and Mr. [Harry C.] Graves, coach Graves wrote down and the correspondence went back and forward and so I decided to go to Tuskegee then.  Now I had never--they're different in nowadays.  They be have all the counselors and what not.  I don't remember having a counselor.  I just went down to Tuskegee and how did I get to Tuskegee?
Speaker 2: What were your experiences at Tuskegee like?
Speaker 1: Changed my life yeah, changed my life altogether.  When I left Washington [D.C.], Graves and Major Abbott, Major Abbott used to be in charge of the tennis team also.  So in the summer time, Tuskegee had a tennis team.  They would travel around to the AT and T, American Tennis Association [ATA].  This was a black tennis--Afro American tennis association.  So they had the tennis tournament at Hampton [Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] in August.  Major Abbott said that he would pick up Lee Shore [ph.] to go back to school, he was here in Washington.  And I could come along and he would take me back to Tuskegee.  My father [Carter Bowman, Sr.] had a friend who's on vacation and we bought a little suitcase, packed me up and I got in his car he drove me down to Hampton, Virginia.  I watched the tournament and then I got on the bus and I drove from Hampton down to Tuskegee.  I don't believe I said a word.  (Laughter)  Sat in the back of the bus and looked at all of the cotton fields, cotton right up to the houses, houses one way going in, red clay.  And I ride to Tuskegee in the evening time, in the nights.  I ride and stayed at one of the old halls, Cassidy Hall.  It was open to athletes working there in the summer time and I walked in that room and there these guys with just muscles their ripping and it was kind of sweaty.  I said my God what (laughter) big fellas were there and I, I really, really enjoyed Tuskegee.
Speaker 2: Did you pledge any fraternities while you were at Tuskegee?
Speaker 1: Up until after the riots I think or after the civil--after the '70s [1870s], Tuskegee never had a fraternities or sororities (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: What they had was clubs, social clubs.
Speaker 2: Were you a part of any social clubs there?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a club called the Kiyi.
Speaker 2: What's it called?
Speaker 1: Kiy, K-I-Y-I.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It was the only club they had ladies with it, women, young ladies they were a part.
Speaker 2: And was it--and it was a social club?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: It was a social club?
Speaker 1: Um-hm. Supposedly people who had, who had good scholarship, I don't know how I got there (laughter).  They always kid me about it.
Speaker 2: What did you study at Tuskegee?
Speaker 1: I studied graphic arts. I, I was going to take up I thought I'd be in physical ed [physical education], but I found out they had a printing department and I went into graphic arts. That's why I said printing and I stayed with printing all my life well just about until I got to be assistant principal.
Speaker 2: Until--what year did you graduate from high school?
Speaker 1: I graduated from high school in 1939.
Speaker 2: And what year did you graduate from Tuskegee?
Speaker 1: Nineteen forty-four [1944].
Story_ID: 260606
Speaker 1: And when you graduated from Tuskegee [Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], what were you planning to do?
Speaker 2: I came back here to Washington [D.C.] and I planned to, to get a job working in, in, in the graphic arts industry, but that changed.  But before I got back to Tuskegee, the reason why I said I enjoyed myself, I was reading something the other day my niece wants to do something on she asked me about the Harlem Renaissance and, and her mother said, "Were any women in Harlem Renaissance?"  I said, "Yes, there was Zora Neale Hurston."  And so I did some research or I have a book on, on African encyclopedia put out by [HistoryMaker Henry Louis "Skip"] Gates [Jr.] ['Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience'] and I looked up Zora Neale Hurston and also we got a book called Legacy and one of the [American] Legacy Magazine they had a article on Zora Neale Hurston and Zora Neale Hurston went back to Florida and she said, "Hey we went back to Florida, New York is all right, but you always looking under being inspected by glass. Livin' in Harlem [New York, New York] people looking at you, looking at you but you went down to Florida you didn't have that.  You were in a kind of closed society.  If you vehicle washed and the conditions in the United States when you went to Tuskegee you were in utopia."  You were everything, no--as the boys said, "No sweat."  You could do almost anything you wanted to because of the influence of the school.  So it was just--it was a different atmosphere altogether.  And so I went to, I went to the football game, I mean I played football, had graphic arts and I didn't make the first team.  I was on the squad, I made squad every year, but had a fella from Houston, Texas called Hike Hollins [ph.] and Hike was an excellent football player.  And when he left, he said, "You know you'd be a good football player if you ever had a girlfriend," which I didn't have one at that time.  So my next year 1941, somebody told me I had a classmate here from my city mate from Washington, D.C. so one Sunday, on Sundays we kind of dressed up. In front of the library, I met this young lady by the name of Maimie Lou Johnson in 1941, so much.  She had just finished, incidentally, [Samuel Chapman] Armstrong [Technical] High School [Armstrong Manual Training School, Washington, D.C.]  here in Washington, I hadn't never seen her before in my life and we met and we been together ever since.  I married her and there she's been a great influence on me. But this was--and then not only that it was [Lee] Shore [ph.], Shore was there.  Shore finished school, he finally finished school.  He, he's not living now.  He, he got hooked up with something but he would never let us know what it was but he was an excellent, he was excellent athlete.  He never did reach his potential because he always stayed in trouble so he was always into something.  But he was, he--but one of the things he would never, never always looked out for me.  Whatever he was doing, he would never let me get involved in it.  But he was a--and then at Tuskegee I had a chance to meet so many friends. When I first got there, one of my roommates was Chappie James [General Daniel James, Jr.].  Chappie went on got air, [U.S.] Air Force pilot.  Went in the Air Force and got to be brigadier general, four star general.

Speaker 1: I met Dr. [George Washington] Carver and it was just--I began to learn about Booker T. Washington--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What were your impressions of Dr. Carver?  What were your impressions of Dr. Carver?
Speaker 1: Very good.  He was a man who was just kind of studious.
Speaker 2: Was he still teaching when you met him over--
Speaker 1: No, no he was--
Speaker 2: --doing research.
Speaker 1: --doing research work, but every year he would come and give a lecture to all the students [at Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and show some of his material.  I saw the first plastic that he had made and he had a hard time catching up with him because he was, he was always busy.  Early in the morning he going out collecting things that people would throw away, so very, very, very good.
Story_ID: 260608
Speaker 1: I met a lot of people.  Matter of fact one of the things that I still keep in touch, I, I began to appreciate and learn more about one of my favorite books is 'Up from Slavery' by Booker T. Washington.  And then at Tuskegee [Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] in the South at that time, they weren't many public high schools.  So in Tuskegee originally start out to be kind of like a normal school.  So they ran a [Tuskegee Institute] High School [Tuskegee, Alabama] also in--with the institute, well now it's university, part of the, the university or the school institute well there were people there who had been to this high school and one of those persons I roomed with my first year.  His name was Wilcox [ph.] from Mississippi.  Generally people had a little money or well off, they would send their children to high school there.  And Wilcox had been to the high school, he knew all the ins and outs of everything.  He knew where all the skeletons and all the good things.  So he--I used to sit there and listen to him and he told me so much about Tuskegee and I, I learned about its philosophy and what not that, that it's one of the things that I really began to grow there.  As I said I played a little football and I used to listen to the people from the South they used to tell me different things about the South and I came up with the philosophy that after I really began to enjoy the South that and this kind of proving my--that when I was in school I left in '44 [1944] and in the next twenty-five or thirty years the South would out, outdo the North in liberalism and as I look at the football games and listen to things sometimes it seems that way.  And incidentally, talking about football when I went to the South there were a very few teams that had athletes from the South.  All of the athletes that are going to [The] Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] and have the Big Ten [Conference] and Syracuse [University, Syracuse, New York] and what not, they would, and they would be nice players but they would--the coaches used to write down and say well I have good boys up here but I can't use 'em.  So all the teams from Florida and what not, had fellas from Ohio, California, Illinois, New York these were--this was a little after [Great] Depression, and these boys were there playing athletics.  It was just a--had a good--had--I met a lot of people.  Met Dorothy Maynor. We used to have what they call it, cultural programs come in and people here used to come in Jimmie Lunceford you know have Jimmie Lunceford now.  You ever heard of Jimmie, Jimmie Lunceford?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: He's a great musician.  He used to come around playing.  And then one of the byproducts of the schools in the South, they used to have bands and they used to have orchestras.  They used to leave the school and in the summertime go out and play.  One of those bands was Erskine Hawkins, called themselves Collegians [Erskine Hawkins and his 'Bama State Collegians] and they fed into Count Basie bands and to other bands because there weren't those kind of opportunities now, then.  Okay.
Story_ID: 260609
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Carter] Bowman, when you left Tuskegee [Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], after you graduated you went to work at the commerce department [U.S. Department of Commerce] here in Washington, D.C. (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, Washington--
Speaker 1: Had they changed the rule that more than one person could work in a federal government in a family?
Speaker 2: Yes that rule was changed during the war [World War II, WWII] yes, okay.
Speaker 1: And what did you do in the commerce department?  What kind of work?
Speaker 2: In commerce department, just a clerk okay. I'm just a clerk commerce department just looking for a job. Before that time I was interested in printing to get into the union.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  And so you were able to get a printing job (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, but not--
Speaker 1: --at Browne Junior High School [Browne Education Campus, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: --yeah but not like I wanted to.  I wanted to be in the commercial printing. And the rule is yes we need printers, but in order to get a job in the union, you have to have a union job.  And how can you get a union job you got to be in the union.  And so I used to go down to the union headquarters and, and sit there and a man would tell me that but I never could and then that's why I went to New York [New York] to, to work with my aunt.  I worked up there for a little while up in the union there and I ran into [Lee] Shore [ph.] while, while I was there for a little while.  But then I eventually decided to come back, back to Washington because I--
Speaker 1: Okay so you came back in 1946.
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: You began teaching printing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, at, at Browne Junior High School.  This was only a temporary job.  And the fellow who I was at--because the enrollment in schools were very heavy and they had a double shift, so a fella be coming I think at 8:30 in the morning and he would teach until twelve, then I would come in at twelve and teach till about 4:30.  And that ran out and then I got the job at Metro [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: And tell us a little bit about Metro.
Speaker 2: Metro were the fella from--the young men who were anxious to have a publishing house and do commercial printing.  They had good equipment but didn't have any money.  They were just--everything was almost--there was--and all of these were young men who all had studied or worked around printing, one fella who was from New York who came in from the union.  He, he was here in Washington.  They all came to be coming out after the war and they do a tremendous job.
Speaker 1: So it was an African American printing--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --company?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And publishing company?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: What kinds of things did you all print?
Speaker 2: We, we printed books, pamphlets.  Right now I often think about it we did some work for the Freedom [sic. Freedoms] Foundation out of Valley Horge--Valley Forge [Pennsylvania] which is the beginning of the, of the conservative movement.  And we did some work from them but because we didn't have a union that little bug on the union label that they soon moved the job from us. We had a fella from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] who was a Republican, I think his name by name Carter [ph.].  He had that contact that we can--they have us a job at first.  They had no complaint about the printing but we couldn't have that little union bug we think if get that financed, I'll get there.  And then we did a--we used to do some printing on, which I paid attention to it, we did work on a far eastern publication, wasn't state department [U.S. Department of State], these people were from the state department or former workers and they used to do publications on Far East, not the Far East on the Middle East, about Palestine and about Iraq and what not and about the oil there.  We did a lot of publications for them.  We did a book tour.  We did a couple of publications made a couple of books and then the biggest problem that we had that in order to have a publishing company or a printing company, you have to have something that will pay that payroll when things got slow and that's what we didn't have.
Speaker 1: So things started to get slow?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you had to find other work?
Speaker 2: Yes and we would--hard, I mean hard to find and people to work for you.  We would work had around the clock and I enjoyed it, it was exciting but some days you would come and somebody when you got paid the fella write you a check, and as one fella come back from the bank, and we all say, "Anything there?"  If he shake his head that mean you might have to go a week or two before you can get anything.   Hard work, long hours--
Story_ID: 260610
Speaker 1: So you did eventually find other work--
Speaker 2: Yes I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) in 1952?
Speaker 2: In 1952 I decided to take the printing exam to the District [of Columbia; Washington, D.C.] and I took the printing exam and I started to work up at Garnet-Patterson [Junior High School, Washington, D.C.].  But that didn't leave me, but--then I was there at night time or evenings or sometime on Sundays I would go back to the printing shop [Metro, Washington, D.C.] because work was hard.  I mean workers were hard, skilled workers were hard to find so I used to work over there sometime at night.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  And Garnet-Patterson is a school in Washington, D.C.?
Speaker 2: A school in Washington, D.C. and at that time in the heart of inner city 10th [Street] and V Streets Northwest.  Some people might say it was rough but it was very nice.  I enjoyed the children, I enjoyed working with 'em.  I had no problem with the school system at that time.
Speaker 1: And you taught printing and graphic arts?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm. Very, the students very nice; had a good faculty.  I met a fellow there that changed my, my leisure activities.  In the fall of the year, I mean in the summer after vacation would start, we would all meet together and we would go down in southern Maryland for a picnic, all the men.  And the fella who was there Captain Larry [ph.] he had a boat and he carried us out and we went fishing.  I never thought much of fishing, but I got hooked.  And I, I, I think now I became one of the better fishermen on the [Chesapeake] Bay.  Matter of fact yeah this year I, I spent--I've been fishing for fifty years on the bay.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Very enjoyable.  I enjoyed every bit of it. But what really got my interest, spike my interest was that the kind of fishing that we were doing. Somebody said Afro Americans didn't troll.  That's letting your line out and the boat is moving.  Some reason or another Afro Americans couldn't, couldn't, didn't troll.  Well that just, that just made me want to find out more about this trolling.  So I became very proficient in trolling.  Okay.
Story_ID: 260611
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about the kind of graphic arts you were teaching students [at Garnet-Patterson Junior High School, Washington, D.C.].  How did you think graphic arts start to change a little bit over the years?
Speaker 2: I saw one fella the other day and we did the original, I mean we used, we began by setting hand type, type by hand.  The original method [Johannes] Gutenberg established this a long time ago.  There was printing generally by hand but in the years I think around 18--I can't think of it now but by the same time that [Christopher] Columbus came about a man in Germany began to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But what were you teaching in the '50s [1950s]?
Speaker 2: In the '50s [1950s]?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: I was teaching basic type setting and printing.  You set hand--you weren't doing the linotype.  You set every letter was on individual character.  Every character was an individual type, you had to assemble those.  Set 'em upside down and because printing is not backwards, but printing is upside down.  You have to learn how to read the type upside down and have the skill, how to you know how to arrange the type, lock it up, print it and run it off.  Now this was taking students in elemen--I mean in junior high school teaching them how to assemble type and now with people, young people with not learning how to read ordinary, learning how read type upside down, giving them some background on the history of printing and understanding why printing is so important, then after I would do that, then I try to incorporate not only the printing but the all industrial parts of, of, of, of architecture, how to, how to use their English.  I used to take them on field trips and say look at the, the land of the buildings, different parts of steel.  Just give 'em a basic history and understanding.  And then along with that we did some silk screening.  This time of year we would make Christmas cards out of silk screen and show 'em how you make Christmas cards.  I had one fella told me I met him he said he was working at a silk screen place doing this work.  He said, I said, "Where you learn that?"  "Don't you remember you taught us that?"  So this came out a good foundation on printing.
Speaker 1: And when did the whole aspect of printing began to change (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It began to change with what they call offset printing.  Offset printing began to change and I used to tell them not only that but offset printing this is the beginning of mechanical printing okay or the use of a lead that what we call hot lead began to move out now everything is mechanically on film and using a computer.  Just a use of color began to change.  It's all changed.  The old hand pressed, feeding the press run by hand.  Everything became automatic.  Now everybody using the computer most of it.
Speaker 1: So did you find that printing as like a subject in school was starting to be replaced by a graphic arts (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --and that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And was it still mandatory?
Speaker 2: No.  And, and they have found--it phased out in Washington, D.C. all of the--those particular things have just faded out.  They don't teach those at all now.
Story_ID: 260612
Speaker 1: How beneficial did you think it was for young people to learn this type of trade and this type of skill?
Speaker 2: Very beneficial.  First of all it took some patience.  Began to learn, had young people who never could have application of you know reading and, and the math.  Why we have to learn the math?  Why do you have to learn how to change a picas to inches, inches to picas and what not because printing used a different measurement than inch and just a learning art work, different colors you know why you have the--why you use yellow, why did I have this yellow sweater on instead of a red, why is one cold you know.  Why blue is cold or why green is a cool color.  And you begin, you begin to teach all these aspects of it and then you'll be surprised because you had, what we call because you go individual characters, they had a place they call the California job case where the A's were in the box and the Bs and the Cs and Ds you'd be surprised at people coming on element-and in schools didn't know the alphabet, and find out you know where you for--I think I read the funny papers.  I still read the funny papers now.  And one of the funny papers they have a character called B.C. comes in every now and then.  And B.C. every now and then writes something on stone and he might spell the word and use a J instead of a U like in June or, or because at one time there were only twenty-four letters in the alphabet and the letter J and U were not included.  So you go back and look at old printing you look at it and you see a V there and you might see the V, the V is in place of the J I mean the V is in place of the U.
Speaker 1: And what would replace the J?
Speaker 2: I--if you take Latin you'll find that out see.  And so you begin to, to--and so know and so when you do the alphabet teaching them and you go to alphabet especially in capital letters, you are--you go all these letters and you get down to what is it J and U they, they the last two letters in the alphabet because they were added.  And so you go under the sequence.  Also I look every now and then I don't look at it now but you look at it, it comes on radio I mean on television spinning the wheel.  What's the name?
Speaker 1: 'Wheel of Fortune'?
Speaker 2: 'Wheel of Fortune' and they always tell you about these different letters.  In the California job case they have letters arranged that where you stood is almost like in the type where the certain letters are in a certain place and because you can get to them easily.  So that when they ask you about what letters you want that beside the vowels, R is always a lot a T is always used and H because you know the E, you have the S now you have letters like J, K in the alphabet so in this case they were already out the way and the small containers and you begin to look at little things.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And boys who were grew up and then we used to in class in conjunction with the English teacher you would have projects where they would print.  Okay.
Speaker 1: So it just taught them a variety of different skills?
Speaker 2: Right.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But then anything now I look at work now and things that have changed now.  The computer is good but it has spoiled all of the things that I knew about the theory of putting ink on paper.  The margins are different now.  People will write anything and because they call because the computer and I look at it and I said this is terrible.
Speaker 1: Do you use the computer?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I have a email.  You see it's on there.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And you can't do without it now.  Yes it's very, very important.
Speaker 1: But there were a lot of good skills other than just printing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --that kids learned from learning how to print?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 260613
Speaker 1: When you retired is that when you started to develop a love for history and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --historical research?
Speaker 2: Well I always liked history and what happened here I--was in the Methodist church you always should have a history committee, archives and history committee and it's always under the auspices of the trustees records.  So I was chairman of the trustee board and they had a historian by Mrs. Gaskins, I'm sorry Ms. [Pauline Gaskins] Mitchell. And I was--and she I used to come along and she used to come over here and give tours.  She gave a lot of tours and I used to come here and listen to her and she got sick.  And so I kind of took it over and I began to look at the records.  And so in doing so about ten years ago now, we got--I applied for a couple of grants from the humanities society [Humanities Council of Washington, D.C., Washington, D.C.] and we got a couple of grants to catalog the works and put it in some kind of order.
Speaker 1: Catalog the works here at Mount Zion [United Methodist Church, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: At Mount Zion.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Fortunately and unfortunately Mount Zion had kept records from 1830 up until, perfect records up until 1956.
Speaker 1: Where did they store them?  Here at the church?
Speaker 2: Here at the church. Any place that--any storage is better than no storage that when you keep history.  And this is what they did.  And so when we and company did the look at the records, we have enough now, records that we haven't finished cataloging and put them in some kind of order using the computer and how we're going to sort so people be accessible to use them.  So we have those and the membership records from 1830 last year we put them on microfilm because they were deteriorating and so they're on microfilm and we have a reader.
Speaker 1: And what have you learned most as the historian here, what's, what's, what's been the most surprising thing that you learned?
Speaker 2: Surprising thing is how these people with, with they been little or more little education maybe formal education as such were able to keep such perfect records and to you know nowadays people, something happen they don't have any wills but its surprised they left wills and they didn't leave much money but they left a will.  And when we began to look at the records, we began to realize what had happened a lot when we began to look at some of the records there were a lot of bank books there.  Some of their, I'm trying to think of what we call them the deeds to the home, okay, and indentured when they borrowed money because as I began to look at it, they couldn't have it, they didn't use banks, they couldn't use banks.  They didn't have any insurance and so and how they took the church to come up with we don't call 'em insurance but it's a form of insurance, oh I can't think of the word now, it slipped my this is my senior moment, but they had societies that would pay for their borrows [ph.] societies and when they got sick and so it, it--they were very skilled in how they, how they looked after one another. And the biggest surprise and which most of the historians they always say that you know that the person who wasn't freed or who wasn't freed they looked down on indenture servant, they looked down on the slaves.  They didn't wanna have anything to do with them.  I think a lady by the name of Green [ph.] write something about how the you know there were kind of dissension in Afro American community--
Speaker 1: Between indentured servants and slaves?
Speaker 2: --and slaves and the freed person because the freed person has a little more education, but I didn't find that true.  What I found out and this was, this was what this church was known for, people who could read, they formed classes and brought the people in and taught them how to read and write.  They, they, they set up the first feeding the poor.  They had, they set up their first organizations to take care of, of the sick and shut in and so these are things that I found out.  So this was--they weren't divided at all.  They pulled together and I was telling someone, someone was talking about the money, very little money as such that this church was built on washing women, on laborers you know they think very little professional people came out, out, out of there.

Speaker 1: Why do you think history is important, [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Carter] Bowman?
Speaker 2: Well if you don't know where you come from, you don't know where you're going.  And I, and I think we had been well, I'll say brainwashed so to look down on our history.  I remember growing up, I--for a long time, I didn't think much of Frederick Douglass.  I was not, but I began to look at his 'Life and Times of Frederick Douglass.' Amazing.  I think they done a job on us.
Story_ID: 260615
Speaker 1: And when you look back at your life what stands out the most to you?
Speaker 2: Just how with really as I like to a couple of things.  I was talking to a fellow and you look back on it and you think about it, I am the second generation from slavery.  That might not seem like much to most people, but I you know second generation.  And just to be able to you know like my mother [Eudora McDaniel Bowman] and them, my mother saw right after slavery she saw segregation, she saw where you know where integration and all these things have come along.  We are moving ahead.  What stands out is just the progress that is happening in the United States, how far we have come.  We've come--imagine we come a mighty long way, we come a mighty long way.  Sometime, we don't realize it, how we get caught up in things and seem like we're slipping but we're not, just to sit down and talk to a young lady like you is, is, is, is, is quite a, quite a thrill.
Story_ID: 260616
Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?  What is it about you you want people to say when you're no longer here?
Speaker 2: Just say that I, I cared not only about, about people and I was able to leave something for some heritage for people to look at to study and look at some of the progress and the difficulties and the gains that first African American's have done.  The history of this church [Mount Zion United Methodist Church, Washington, D.C.] is you can coincide with the history of Washington, D.C.  Downstairs we have a, I have a timeline and whatever happened in Washington during that time, it just about happened out of this church or this surrounding here.  We have people, Afro Americans, other people would come in Georgetown [Washington, D.C.] and they come here shopping and they have a good time.  They buy their gold and they never realize how having people come by I never realize that Afro Americans lived here.  And that we lived here, we families and did things so that's really one of the things. I think I said in article I want to be remembered that Afro Americans with them played a very important part in history not only of the District [of Columbia] but the history of the United States.  You know I didn't go to--I finished Tuskegee [Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and I'm teaching but I didn't go to get my master's degree until I was about fifty something years old.  I went to University of Pittsburgh [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], had a little scholarship up there.  I had been to the South.  I been here in time to see the government.  I went to the South when there were agriculture growing up, agrarian society and then I went to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], which is a whole different ballgame together.  Everything up there was industrial.  And some people didn't enjoy but I enjoyed it because I guess I had came from an industrial background because I saw people doing that type of work that you didn't think a human being would do working in those steel mills all hours, sweat and dirt and then you came to realization that you know a man or woman will do a lot of things to take care of their family, you wouldn't, wouldn't imagine.  And, and I mean legally, I mean hard work trying to take care of their families, and do things.  So I had a different perspective of, of the whole United States together.

Speaker 1: What message do you want to leave for your children [Carter Bowman III] and your grandchildren [Carter Bowman IV and Savannah Bowman]?
Speaker 2: My grandchildren.  I have a young girl.  She's what? She's twelve years old.  They're from a different ballgame now.  I told her I said, "You know I can't, I don't know that rap music."  She said, "Grandpa you can read that grap music--rap music."  She told me things, and you know she said "Don't talk to the hand (laughter) talk to the face, don't talk to the hand."   She a little different than the rest of them.  They have a--they come from a different background.
Speaker 1: But what message do you want to leave for them?  What do you think is important to impart upon them.
Speaker 2: I want them to be good citizens and to whatever they do, whatever they decide to do to, to, to be straightforward and be honest and forthright and to do the best that they can.  Okay.  And whatever it is that they if they do the best if they enjoy doing it that's the most important thing.  I'm not worried about the money part.  But enjoy what they're doing and live a wholesome clean life.  That's what I want them to do.  I cannot, I haven't said much about my son, he very, very means everything but he got caught up in the nonconformance.  He was in that--he was down there at the March [on Washington] when [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was there.  He was going through a couple of assassinations you know King and Martin, Malcolm X and a few other people like Kennedy and things were--and the war in Vietnam [Vietnam War] and what not.  So he never has reached his potential but I guess that's man's burden to reach his potential, has so much potential.  But he's honest and so he works hard but he's from a different cloth. He's good to them so but anyhow this is what I want my children to do and as I said they're fine.  I told them they're fine.  They're from a mixed, mixed race and they're going to--they're pioneers.  They're, they're pioneers.  They're where--they're the next generation that is coming along and it--and I see it every time.  This is a different world now.  You travel and see children moving, young people moving and I see (unclear). It's amazing how y'all have traveled and move around and see a different life and they have different ideas and things and I think a lot of it's right, so "Don't talk to the hand, talk to the hand."
