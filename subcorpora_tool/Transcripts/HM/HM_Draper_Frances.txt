Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and they just require a short answer.  The first one is, ma'am, what is your favorite food?

Story_ID: 142415
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, I want to ask you about your family history and we'll start with your--well, your--I'm going to ask you about your mother's side and your father's side--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --but we'll start by identifying them.  If you can give us the names of your parents and spell them for us and their dates and places of birth?
Speaker 2: Okay.  My father's name is James Edward Wood, Sr.  His date of birth is April 24th, 1924 and he was born in Kentucky, I believe Louisville [Kentucky].  My mother's name is [HM] Frances Louise Murphy II.  Her date of birth is October 8th, 1922 and she was born in Baltimore, Maryland.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What year was your father born?
Speaker 2: Nineteen twenty-four [1924].
Speaker 1: Okay, 1924, okay.
Story_ID: 142416
Speaker 1: Now can you tell us as much as you know about your father's [James Edward Wood, Sr.] side of the family?  How far back can they be traced and--
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.  I know that they are out of Kentucky.  My grandfather was an educator and a college president and he's recruited to come to Baltimore [Maryland].  He's the first superintendent of what was called, "colored schools" and so they moved here to Baltimore.  He had a Ph.D. but I don't know where it was from and he and his wife and four children moved here probably in late '20s [1920s], early '30s [1930s].  I'm trying to remember.  And he died when my dad was a freshman at Howard [University, Washington, D.C], so I didn't know my grandfather but my grandmother died at the age of ninety-nine in 1986 so I knew her well.  And so most of the family history that I know about that family--I know that they were--they owned horse farms in Kentucky and they had a farm here in Catonsville, Maryland and a camp for underprivileged children.  I know that much.  And my father's one of four siblings, one of whom we funeralized last week, the oldest one, a couple of years ago, and so it's my dad and his sister who's still--who's still living.  And so we probably, I think there's some family history dating back to at least the early 1900s, from my father's side of the family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were there any stories from the slavery period or the Civil War that they tell or anything like that?
Speaker 2: They don't--they've not told many stories but I did find out, which I didn't know until I was an adult, that there are some Baptist preachers in the family.  So I didn't know until I entered the ministry that we had preachers--in that--on that side of the family.
Speaker 1: Did--so you don't know where your grandfather went to school or where he was educated or anything like that?
Speaker 2: I just don't remember.  My grandmother went to Berea College [Berea, Kentucky].
Speaker 1: In Berea, Kentucky.
Speaker 2: In Kentucky and after her first husband died, after Dr. Wood died, she married a gentleman who owned a catering firm, and I do remember growing up, being in that big kitchen, as she would prepare ban-- food for banquets and other things that they would do in the catering business.
Story_ID: 142417
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now tell us about your mother's [HM Frances Louise Murphy II] side of the family.  How far back can you trace that?
Speaker 2: My mother's side of the family, we can trace that back. My grand-- great-grandfather [John H. Murphy, Sr.] founded the [Afro-American] newspaper [later, Baltimore Afro-American, Baltimore, Maryland] in 1892.  He was born in 1840 and so he was fifty-two years old, a whitewasher by trade, had been enslaved, had served in the Civil War and then as a free man he started this paper.  Well, it really was a printing business at first.  It was a business that printed feed sheets for farmers and he purchased the printing press and the name.  The name of the business was Afro-American.  The name was in existence then in 1892 and he and my grandmother, Martha, had ten children, five male children and five female children.  And so the family legend says that, depends on who tells it, if the women tells the story, they say that great-grandma Martha loaned him two hundred dollars to buy the name and the printing press.  The men of the family say that's not how it was.  She just gave him the two hundred dollars but nonetheless, at an auction, he purchased this printing press and the name Afro-American on which had been used as I said, for feed sheet and began printing a one-page paper of community news for three cents and that was when less than, I understand, two percent of the African American population could read.  And so I know a little bit about that side of the family.  We've researched some of that.  His--
Speaker 1: I just want to ask a question.  It seems odd, the feed sheet?  Now this is a sheet that the farmers used to determine--
Speaker 2: Well it was one that gave the prices for the feed that they were buying for their livestock.  That's what that press had been used for at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so the--
Speaker 1: The name was--
Speaker 2: The name was Afro-American.  So I don't know all of that history behind that but I know that name was already in existence.  A lot of people think that's a new terminology but it was--I mean it was there in 1892.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was something called, [National] Afro-American League and that was founded by Timothy Thomas Fortune in the 1890s--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --that was popular in, you know--he was supposed to be--
Speaker 2: He was a publisher too, Thomas Fortune.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, he was editor of the New York Age [New York, New York]--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --in New York [City], which is a popular paper and went on to work for Booker T. Washington.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: So that was--that's one of the names that kind of jumped out.
Speaker 2: He was there for a while and great-grandfather John, was his name, John H. Murphy, Sr., and his wife was, I said, Martha, they had ten children, five males, five females and they raised the boys to work in the paper and also take care of their sisters.  That was their goal,that was their charge.  But he died in 1922, at the--in the same year that my mother was born and he tapped my grandfather, Carl [Dr. Carl J. Murphy], to run the paper and Carl was a professor of German at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] at the time.  And my grandmother was one of his students and she's the co-founder of Delta Sigma Theta [Vashti Turley Murphy] and so he left Howard and came over to run the paper until his death in 1967.  But each of the males had a role in the paper, and so did the females, after the war [World War II] came because the men went off to war and the women ran the business.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, this is one of the most important papers in the black community, the Afro-American.
Speaker 2: Well it's the oldest, continuously published African American publication by the same family.  And there's another paper that claims to be older, but I don't think they were continuously published in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, but the Afro-American, the Pittsburgh Courier [later, New Pittsburgh Courier, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], The Chicago Defender [Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Right, the [New York] Amsterdam News [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: To a lesser extent because of the--
Speaker 2: To a lesser extent.
Speaker 1: --dissemination wasn't as wide but the Afro-American--
Speaker 2: And the Norfolk Journal and Guide [later, New Journal and Guide, Norfolk, Virginia]--
Speaker 1: The Norfolk Journal and Guide, right.
Speaker 2: But the Afro at one time had thirteen editions and so it filled the void, I guess, for news in those areas where there weren't any African American publications at all.
Story_ID: 142418
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, tell us about your mother [HM Frances Louise Murphy II] and just, just what is she like and what does she do?  What does she do?
Speaker 2: Well, what doesn't she do?  My mother, who will be eighty-one next week, is just full of life, full of energy.  She and her--I'll give you a little bit of background.  The State of Maryland would not allow African Americans go to the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland].  So the state paid for my mother and her sisters to go to colleges other places.  So my mother went to the University of Wisconsin [Madison, Wisconsin], and that's where she received her journalism degree.  And she said it was very painful at that time because many people had not seen African Americans and they were asking whether there was some kind of Mardi Gras or something, you know, in her town that makes you color your skin.  But she went there and she was--graduated with honors from the University of Wisconsin and came back to work at the family business, at the paper [Afro-American, later Baltimore Afro-American, Baltimore, Maryland].  And so she worked there for a while, in both our Richmond [Virginia] offices and our Washington [D.C.] office and then our Baltimore [Maryland] and she left and she taught school for a while.  She did some work at Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland] in their public relations department and then she ended up coming back to the Afro[Afro-American] I guess in the early '70s [1970s] 'cause her father [Dr. Carl J. Murphy] died in 1967 and another cousin ran the business for a couple of years and then she came and ran the business until she retired and moved to Buffalo [New York] to become a professor of journalism there at Buff State [Buffalo State College, Buffalo, New York] and then she came back to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  So she's got a full, active life.  She still writes for the paper, every week.  She writes editorials.  She just started a new column.  Well, it's really not new.  Her sister, Betty [ph.], had written that column for years called, If You Ask Me so my mother has resurrected it as of last month which is, what August, and so she's active.  Anytime she feels like it, she'll go out and play eighteen holes of golf (laughter).  No, she just enjoys her life.  She's--she spent some time this week in Washington at the Congressional Black Caucus and the different receptions and she's a member of, you name it, she's on their roll.  She's on the vestry at her church, which is a leadership role there, in the Episcopal Church.  Head of one of the guilds there and my mother leads a very full and active, and happy life.
Story_ID: 142419
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now tell us about your father [James Edward Wood, Sr.].  What's he like and--
Speaker 2: Well my dad is a--I think I may have mentioned this already, he's a--he's a graduate of Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  In fact, he went to college at sixteen.  And my dad is a fun-loving, outgoing kind of person.  Most of his professional life was in the music business.  When he and my mom [HM Frances Louise Murphy II] divorced, I guess in the '60s [1960s] sometime--somewhere in the '60s [1960s], he remarried a jazz singer by the name of Damita Jo [DeBlanc], and they traveled all over the world.  He also managed the Four Tops at one time and Slappy White at one time and a couple of other comedians and so my dad has friends, I say, all over the world because he's a person who makes friends very easily.  He's the only one I know--we'd tease him and waited until he was in his seventies to get a job that you, you know, actually have to go to and do something.  So he started doing some proofreading for a printing business for a friend of his and my husband ended up buying that business from that friend about three years ago.  So my dad is still living.  He says he can't do all that he would like to do anymore because of--his health is good but he can't go into the smoky places.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  He can't do that but he's--
Speaker 1: In the entertainment business.
Speaker 2: The entertainment, right, he can't--
Speaker 1: That was, yeah, I guess that's where--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --everybody was, in the smoky places.
Speaker 2: Right, so that's not good for his lungs so he can't do that.
Speaker 1: Well, they're cutting back on smoking now in public places so he may--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --be able to--
Speaker 2: Right, one day right, get back there--
Story_ID: 142420
Speaker 1: Okay, well, tell us about growing up.  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?  And kind of describe what your neighborhood was like.
Speaker 2: Well, I grew up in more than one place because of the newspaper business so most of the sights were through the lenses of somebody's camera or typewriter at that time, you know, before computers.  My grandfather [Dr. Carl J. Murphy] believed, if you could walk, you could work.  And where could you work?  You could work at the paper [Afro-American, later Baltimore Afro-American, Baltimore, Maryland].  You could do something at the paper whether it was picking up something off the floor or, you know, calling up somebody.  So we worked very early in the family business.  My mom [Frances Louis Murphy II] tried, of course, to have us do some other things and to be balanced but I just remember spending a lot of time at the paper, watching the photographers develop pictures or, you know, if my mom or dad [James Edward Woods, Sr.]--'cause my dad worked at the paper a little bit too, when he and my mom were together, you know, going on assignments with them or going on trips wherever they had to go for the paper.  And so that was a lot of what happened growing up.  But I also recall, you know, going to church growing up, being a part of Jack 'n Jill [Jack and Jill] and play things like that growing up.  And I was the oldest so I had a lot of responsibility when I wasn't traveling with-- with my mom.
Story_ID: 142421
Speaker 1: How many siblings do you have?
Speaker 2: Well, I have two siblings that I grew up with and then my parents [HM Frances Louis Murphy II and James Edward Woods, Sr.] had both remarried and so the sibling pool expanded--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --as they remarried.
Speaker 1: So, how many--well how many brothers and sisters and how many altogether?
Speaker 2: Okay, three of us have the same mom and dad and that's my brother, Dr. James Wood [ph.], who's chief of orthopedics at Harbor Hospital [MedStar Harbor Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland].  And my sister, Susan Murphy Barns [ph.], who is with her husband in Biloxi, Mississippi, he's a doctor of osteopathic medicine.  And then I have a sister, Stephanie [ph.], a step-sister Stephanie, that's in New Jersey and a half brother, John Jeffrey [ph.], that's in California.  And when my mother remarried, I got three brothers, one of whom is here in Baltimore [Maryland] and two are in Buffalo [New York].
Story_ID: 142422
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, well, tell us more about growing up.  Now, what kind of little girl were you and what did you like to do?
Speaker 2: I was a quiet little girl.  I was a pretty quiet little girl.  A pretty good student.  As I grew up into--and I was a tomboy growing up too, so I wasn't really interested in the doll things and the girl things, you know.  I was interested in playing ball, but I still got picked last, but I, you know, I was interested in playing ball and so most of my time was--I like outside better than inside so I spent a lot of time outside playing baseball, softball.  Like I said, the girl things, that wasn't my thing too much.  What other things did I do growing up as a little girl?  I say mostly outdoors kinds of things.  I remember going to camp every year and enjoying all of those outdoor activities on the water and those types of things.  And then when I got into junior high school, I started, you know, playing softball a little bit more seriously all through junior high school and in high school [at Frederick Douglass High School, Baltimore, Maryland], and a little bit into college, but then I had other interests when I got into college.
Speaker 1: Okay, well academics and so forth, of course.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, you know, right, right.
Story_ID: 142423
Speaker 1: Okay, so what, what was your neighborhood like?
Speaker 2: The first neighborhood that I remember is we lived in the Mayfair [Mansions] Apartments in Washington [D.C.] and I remember the address because it was easy, 3773 J Street and I remember doing first and second grade there and that was some kind of housing complex development, I don't know, apartments, I remember that--I remember that.  And I remember then moving to Baltimore [Maryland] to a pretty close-knit neighborhood in northwest Baltimore and that was a neighborhood where you knew everybody.  I don't remember too many of the neighbors from Washington, maybe one or two but in Baltimore, everybody knew everybody.  And it's one of those--because Baltimore is a city of neighborhoods and so I remember and there were a lot of children in that neighborhood and so--
Speaker 1: Is that the neighborhood over by Morgan State [University, Baltimore, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: No, that's the neighborhood in innercity Baltimore near Mondawmin Mall [Baltimore, Maryland].  I don't know if that means anything but that's--
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: --but that's where that neighborhood is.
Speaker 1: Mondawmin Mall is a--was it open then when you were--
Speaker 2: Well, it opened--when I went to high school, they were building Mondawmin Mall and I went to [Frederick] Douglass High School [Baltimore, Maryland] across the street from--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --there so I kind of watched its development.  So that's the neighborhood where I spent most of my growing up years from, I think we moved there I was in the second or third grade and stayed there all the way through high school.  So it was one of those neighborhoods where everybody knew everybody.  In fact, if you got in trouble in school, as I did once, you knew about it all the way walking home, almost every adult came to the door 'cause you know people's moms stayed at home a little bit more and they would say, I know you're going to get in trouble today.  So they all knew about it but I don't remember where the transgression was but I remember being reminded of it in my three or four block walk home.
Story_ID: 142424
Speaker 1: Now was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Church was a big--church was a big part of growing up.  We went to St. James Episcopal Church here in Baltimore [Maryland] but I mean I was--you know I kind of went to church because my mother [HM Frances Louise Murphy II] said you went to church but as soon as I was old enough not to go to church, I didn't go to church but I sung in the choir and, you know, I was dutiful.
Speaker 1: How old were you when you stopped?
Speaker 2: Maybe sixteen--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --seventeen.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, Episcopal churches are rather, you know, formal--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --kind of a church, kind of staid church.
Speaker 2: Everybody stands together kneels together, does this, you know.  You spent a lot of time trying to figure out when to do those things.
Story_ID: 142425
Speaker 1: Right, right.  Now, was music a big part of growing up?  I mean, popular music or--
Speaker 2: Yes, I mean I'm a child of the '60s [1960s], and so, you know, and I grew up in an era where you didn't--I mean if you went to parties, of course, it was supervised and your mother took you, your mother picked you up--well, my mother [HM Frances Louise Murphy II] picked you up earlier than when the party let out, you know, and when she picked me up, everybody who came with us had to go too so they would stand at the top of the steps and say, "Toni [ph.], Pat [ph.] and Sandy [ph.], somebody's mother's here."  But music was a big part.  You know, we grew up in the era where, you know, you followed [The] Temptations or the Miracles or Martha and the Vandellas and you knew all the words, you know, and they were words you could actually say, and sing out loud--
Speaker 1: In public (laughter).
Speaker 2: --and nobody would look at you and wonder what are you saying and is that some language you're supposed to be using.  So, yeah, I grew up loving all of the music of this, and I still like the music of the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Who were your favorite musicians?
Speaker 2: Growing up, I think, that whole Motown group amongst the favorite, you know, I mean [HM] Jerry Butler, when he was Jerry Butler and The Impressions, you know.  I see you know something about that too.  So, I liked--I liked Jerry Butler.  I liked Smokey Robinson, you know.  I liked the original Temptations.  I liked Stevie Wonder.  I mean he came a little later but--
Story_ID: 142426
Speaker 1: Now did you have a chance to ever meet these celebrities around the Afro-American [later Baltimore Afro-American, Baltimore, Maryland] at events and those kinds of things?
Speaker 2: I met some.  I met--for the most--I mean, not when I was growing--when I was growing up, I don't remember as much as I do when I got older and they would come through because one of my aunts was the entertainment editor and so when they would come, we would get to meet them and then most recently I got to meet Bill Withers, I mean while I was at the paper.  He had a problem at the market where he felt his son was being discriminated against so he came up and complained to the paper.  We did a story and got a chance to talk with him about that and to just talk about some things from the past.  But I met Smokey Robinson a couple of times but not being at the paper.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We had gone to New York [New York] for, I don't know why we were there, and my sister, who's much more outgoing than I am, had seen him in the restaurant or something and invited him, you're going to laugh at this story because you know my mother, [HM Frances Louise Murphy II] invited him up to the hotel room and he knocked on the door the next day.  And my sister's screaming, she says, "That's Smokey Robinson, open the door."  My mother said, "I don't care who it is, I don't know him, he's not coming--he's not coming in here and you stop talking to strange folks."  So, I got to meet him a little later, but she was not letting him in.
Speaker 1: That's a funny story.  How old were you then?
Speaker 2: Let's see, I was probably in my early twenties and she was a teenager.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: But I got to meet many more entertainers traveling with my dad [James Edward Woods, Sr.].
Story_ID: 142427
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, so did you spend a lot of time with your father [James Edward Wood, Sr.] then when, you know--
Speaker 2: Well, I spent a considerable amount of time every year because she [Damita Jo DeBlanc] always headlined, I forgot Club Harlem [Atlantic City, New Jersey] or one of those clubs in Atlantic--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Damita Jo was one of the, she was--
Speaker 2: --Atlantic City [New Jersey].
Speaker 1: --you know, a well-known vocalist---
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --back in the '60s [1960s], I guess, I mean, maybe, yeah.
Speaker 2: Right, '50s [1950s] and '60s [1960s]--'60s [960s], and so she did Atlantic City every year so I'd go there or if she did--she did the beach clubs down in Florida.  She would do the clubs in New York [City], The Copacabana [New York, New York] and places like that.  And so, as a young child, I mean I was kind of fascinated with that because that's--you know, I didn't go to clubs when I got older but as a young child (laughter) I would go in.  They'd do those, what do you call those things, those breakfast shows--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --and you know it wouldn't start until, like, two in the morning and so that was a big deal, you know, prop your eyes open and see who you could see.  So I got to meet a lot of, you know, the Ella Fitzgeralds of the world and the jazz singers.
Speaker 1: There's only one of them.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, that is so true-[HM] Gloria Lynne, [HM] Nancy Wilson, people like that, depending on where she was traveling.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any stories about any of these people that you remember or anything that, any--
Speaker 2: I-they [James Edward Wood, Sr. and Damita Jo DeBlanc] lived in the same apartment complex with Jackie Wilson, when they lived in New York, and I remember going into his apartment and seeing all the gold records up on the wall and I'm trying to think whether or not--this was a long time ago, whether he didn't have a shirt on and he had some scars or something, or it was something I was really curious about.  I remember talking to him but he was eating so he didn't, you know, he kind of waved to me and that was it.  I remember--what was the guy's name that worked on Car 40-'Car 54, Where Are You?'  He played the policeman [Joe E. Ross].  He lived in that apartment so I got to talk to him.
Speaker 1: Fred Gwynne, the tall one?
Speaker 2: I think--no, no, the stocky one [Joe E. Ross].
Speaker 1: The short, oh yeah, I know who you're talking about.
Speaker 2: But I got to meet him one time.  And then a funny story is, when my dad was managing the Four Tops, and I was a teenager then, and we went to one of the shows, and they did this thing of taking the mic around so people could sing and they got to my table and put the mic in my face and I actually crawled under, literally, disappeared under the table.  And he's like, down there and saying, and I'm like, whoa, now I'm sure all of that was recorded but I was not--this was not the church choir and I was not doing that.  So that's a pretty funny story.
Speaker 1: Okay, how old were you then?
Speaker 2: Fourteen, fifteen.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is funny (laughter).
Speaker 2: And my friends--I mean, they were just dying laughing because we would sing, you know, we learned all those songs and tried to imitate their steps, you know, and we had it down, you know--we'd--in Baltimore [Maryland], you know, you could stand on the corner waiting for your bus going to school and, you know, you could break out into an a cappella, so they really thought that was funny.  I wouldn't say a thing and actually got out of my chair and just slid under the table.
Story_ID: 142428
Speaker 1: Yup, yup, Baltimore [Maryland] seems to have a reputation of being a--a town that kind of typified that era for some reason--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and there's been a lot of movies about things going on in Baltimore and those days and I think there's even a movie called 'Hairspray' or something like that--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --the black--
Speaker 2: It was based--
Speaker 1: --about the dance party TV show--
Speaker 2: --'Buddy Deane Show.'  But you know that was a--that was a segregated show and so the white kids went most of the week and we went one day a week.  And I went on there one time, you know, and I never will forget it because it's like all these kids in a room and they start counting down and tell you that the show's getting ready to start, you know, and they start--and then they want you to just dance instantly and the song was, all I remember was 'He's So Fine' and all of a sudden everybody just started dancing.  That was how big Buddy Deane debuted but I never went back.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know why, I mean, it wasn't that it was bad, I just never went back.
Speaker 1: The exciting thing, though, I guess for those days.
Speaker 2: Oh, it was exciting to get in.

Speaker 1: Tell me about school.  Where did you go to grade school?
Speaker 2: I went to Grimke Elementary [School, later Grimke School, Washington, D.C.] for first grade--for kindergarten and first grade, and then I went to--schools had numbers, not necessarily, some had numbers.  I then went to School 60--Grimke's in Washington [D.C.].  I went to School 63 [Rosemont Elementary Middle School] in Baltimore [Maryland] for second and third grade and that school was actually housed in the basement of a church because we didn't have a school in our neighborhood.  Then they built a new school which is called Gwynns Falls Elementary School, School Number 60 [Baltimore, Maryland], so I went there for fourth, fifth and sixth grade.  So that's where I went to grade school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did you do well in grade school?
Speaker 2: As far as I can remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean I was, I was a good student.
Speaker 1: What were your favorite subjects?
Speaker 2: Reading was my favorite subject.
Speaker 1: Okay, and did you have favorite teachers?
Speaker 2: I went to, one, two, three grade schools, so I think, I'm trying to remember (laughter), it's a long time ago.  I think my sixth grade teacher, Pauline Paisel [ph.] was my favorite teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay, and she taught reading?
Speaker 2: She taught--she was--she taught, at that time, you know, that one teacher taught everything.  You know, you didn't have the specialization that you do today and so she taught everything.  In fact, I've heard from her in the last ten years.  She still had a paper I wrote in sixth grade and so she mailed it to me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was some little story I'd made up about somebody's life, I don't know.  Something I had written in sixth grade and she mailed it to me a few years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 141451
Speaker 1: Now-- now you were into sports, you said, when you were--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that age.  You played a lot of softball, baseball--
Speaker 2: I started playing, in fact, I remember a story in the sixth grade [at Gwynns Falls Elementary School, Baltimore, Maryland] where we had a student teacher and she wanted all the girls to do dancing and all the guys to go outside and play ball.  I didn't want to do dancing and she wouldn't let me do the ball thing so I just kind of sat, you know, I just sat it out.  But, I started really being interested in ball maybe the fifth, sixth grade.
Speaker 1: What inspired you to play ball?  I mean, you know, was there--were there any--was there--
Speaker 2: Well my closest sibling is fifteen months younger than I am and so we played together and I just--you know I just liked doing it--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know.  I mean, I just liked it.  I mean I wasn't--I wasn't into the doll thing.  I don't remember--I remember having--I don't remember--I have seen pictures that I had a doll but I don't remember--like my daughter, God has a way of evening the playing field, 'cause my daughter has dolls galore, I mean, just--just dolls and she's twenty-seven and we still buy her at least one doll a year.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you have a--did you watch the [Baltimore] Orioles and pay attention to what, you know, baseball and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Well my mom [HM Frances Louise Murphy II]--well, believe it or not, in my house we were football fans and my mother was a Baltimore Colts [later, Indianapolis Colts] fan and on Sunday you didn't get your dinner until after they went off, at that time, in the '50s [1950s], on the radio, so you could just sit there and listen to the Colts and know you were going to get your baked chicken after that.  So we were--I'm still a big football fan.  We were big football fans in terms of professional sports but my brother played little league ball and so we followed the little league baseball.
Speaker 1: Did you ever meet Lenny Moore?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: Okay, or--
Speaker 2: I did meet--
Speaker 1: Johnny Sample or any of them?
Speaker 2: --I met Lenny Moore.  I met [Eugene "Gene"] Big Daddy Lipscomb--
Speaker 1: Big Daddy Lipscomb, right.
Speaker 2: I'm trying to think who else I met.  I met quite a few of the Colts but Lenny Moore--and I've seen him recently.
Speaker 1: That was an interesting team, you know, people--it's a team that--that's continually brought up again--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --on sports shows and they talk about--
Speaker 2: [Johnny] John Unitas--
Speaker 1: Yeah, legend--
Speaker 2: --and Ray Berry--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and so we, you know, you kind of knew the players and, you know, you can remember that, you know, Unitas was [number] nineteen and Berry was [number] eighty-eight [sic, eighty-two] and Moore was [number] twenty-four.  I mean, we were big football fans.
Story_ID: 141452
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, now-- tell me about high school, I guess.
Speaker 2: Well, we did junior high school and then we did high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, you were in junior high, okay.
Speaker 2: I went to [William H.] Lemmel Junior High School [Baltimore, Maryland] for seventh, eighth and ninth and--
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: L-E-M-M-E-L, it was a William H. Lemmel, and it was a brand new school.  We were the first full graduating class of that school and I remember that because the principal, who was no taller than maybe five feet, Herimone Wharton [ph.], I mean she ran--she just ran that school and everybody respected her.  And so I came through junior high school at a time where young people were still respectil--respected teachers and, you know, we kind of went there to do our work.
Story_ID: 141453
Speaker 1: And then I left there and went to Western High School [Baltimore, Maryland] for a year.  There were only seven--six others that looked like I did.
Speaker 2: Now, what was significant about Western High School?  Was it--
Speaker 1: Well the significant--the significant thing about--
Speaker 2: Was it out of your neighborhood or--
Speaker 1: --it was out of your neighborhood but, you know, Baltimore [Maryland], we had segregated schools until the Brown versus Board of Education decision in 1954 [Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483] and so mostly everybody went to two of--one of two black high schools here, either [Paul Laurence] Dunbar High School or Frederick Douglass High School [Baltimore, Maryland].  And even though there were many more high schools, you weren't allowed to go.  And so even when I went to high school in '62 [1962], which was not that far beyond that decision, very few of us were integrating at the high school level.  And so, you know, my mother [HM Frances Louise Murphy II] thought that would be a good thing for me to do.  But it really wasn't a good experience.  I mean I stayed there for a year.  I stayed there until November 22nd, '63 [1963, November 22, 1963] because that's the date [President John F.] Kennedy was assassinated because I remember transferring--I mean that--those two things didn't have anything to do with each other but I just remember that being that day.
Speaker 2: Now, you started school there, right?
Speaker 1: I started school at Western--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --High School--
Speaker 2: Western High, okay.
Speaker 1: --which is an all-girls--in fact, it's still one of two only all-girls public high schools in the whole country.  The other one is girls high in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  So, it's an--it was an all-womens high school in downtown Baltimore.  When I went in '62 [1962] or three [1963], I forgot which year, there were only seven African Americans in the whole school.  No black teachers, at all, or administrators.  So it was a--I mean we were kind of close with each other but it was a pretty uncomfortable situation and one that I wasn't really used to either.
Story_ID: 141454
Speaker 1: That fall of '63 [1963] was also the March on Washington, just before [President John F.] Kennedy--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --I mean the September before or the August [August 28, 1963] before--
Speaker 2: I must have gone [to Western High School, Baltimore, Maryland] in '62 [1962].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I must have gone in '62 [1962].
Speaker 1: Okay, but do you remember the March on Washington?
Speaker 2: I went to the March on Washington.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I remember that and then we went back when he [President John F. Kennedy] was assassinated and stood in that long line to try to get to the [Capitol] Rotunda, to view the body.  We didn't get anywhere close.  I think we were out there for like four or five hours.
Story_ID: 141455
Speaker 1: So my high school years--then I transferred to [Frederick] Douglass High School [Baltimore, Maryland] in the eleventh grade.  I mean--you know, you're talking about a difference between night and day.  That was a difference, you know.  That was a--that was a major--or just my grandmother was the principal of the school.  So if I had--look, I probably, if I'd known now then what I know now, I may have gone to another school besides that one because it's kind of hard when your grandmother's the principal of the school.
Speaker 2: That was right there in the neighborhood, though, right?
Speaker 1: That was in the neighborhood.  I could walk to Douglass.  You know, I was a good student.  I graduated--I'm in the top probably 1 percent of the class.  I was pretty quiet.  I did--I played softball and was in like the Spanish club or something like that.
Speaker 2: Did you run for class officer?
Speaker 1: I did not.  I was--I did not run for class office.
Speaker 2: So you were kind of shy?
Speaker 1: I was--I was.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I was quiet.
Speaker 2: All right, all right.  Now--what were your favorite--were you still into literature and reading and that sort of thing?
Speaker 1: My favorite subjects were foreign languages.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so when other kids took math--when I finished my math requirements, I said that's wonderful, what else can I take?  So I was--I took French and Spanish--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --in eleventh and twelfth grade because I had finished the math by then.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, you're kind of shy and--
Speaker 1: Kind of shy, I mean not real shy.  Not real, real shy because in junior high school, for example, I signed up to participate in declamation contests, 'cause I always liked to speak, even though I was talking to the clock on the walls, so it was all right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know, and I remember--I don't know why I picked this speech from Woodrow Wilson and his Fourteen Points for the treaty of something, Treaty of Paris or something.
Speaker 2: Of Versailles [Treaty of Versailles].
Speaker 1: Versailles or something, I memorized the whole thing.
Speaker 2: Not Versailles, I forget--
Speaker 1: No, it was a Treaty, it wasn't Versailles--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's a Treaty of--
Speaker 1: --of Paris [sic, Treaty of Versailles], I think.  So I wasn't that shy.
Speaker 2: Okay, how did that work?  How did that, you know--how'd you do at that speech?
Speaker 1: I mean, I did it (laughter).  I didn't win that contest but I did it and then anytime there's a school play, I would, you know, go out for a part.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you weren't that--
Speaker 1: No, I wasn't that shy.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I mean that was in junior high school.  But high school, I think, what happened was by my transferring mid-high school career, I spent my--because at that time high school was tenth, eleventh and twelfth, so I spent all of tenth grade and two months of the eleventh grade at one school.  And then I transferred to a school my grandmother was the principal.  So I really wasn't trying to be a star, you know, because as soon as you know kids find out your grandmother's the principal, you know, it's like, okay, you know.  Do we have to answer that question every day.  So it wasn't that I was that shy, just wasn't trying to be real noticed, I don't think.
Story_ID: 141456
Speaker 1: All right, now when--well, who were some of the teachers at Frederick Douglass [High School, Baltimore, Maryland] that really stood out or were helpful to you?
Speaker 2: Muriel Callaman who was my French teacher.  I can't remember her name but I see her face all the time, the Spanish teacher stood out.  We had--we had good teachers at Frederick Douglass.  I remember the English teacher there 'cause I don't remember--the math or sciences are a blur, even though I did okay in them, that just wasn't my favorite thing to do.  Gym was good.
Speaker 1: Okay, they let you play a lot of softball.
Speaker 2: Right, I just played a lot of softball.  This is an inner-city school and so, you know, if somebody hit the ball over the fence, it was in the street where cars were whizzing by and I was an outfielder so you know you kind of--judge you know how much of this fence you're going to tackle.  It wasn't even important trying to jump over it 'cause it's nothing but cars down there.
Story_ID: 141457
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well, when you were a senior [at Frederick Douglass High School, Baltimore, Maryland], did you have an idea of what you wanted to do career-wise?
Speaker 2: At that time--when I was in high school, I'd always been programmed to teach, you know, so you--my mother [HM Frances Louise Murphy II] kind of programmed us early in terms of, you know, do you want to do journalism?  Well, I didn't want to do journalism but I worked at the paper [Afro-American, later Baltimore Afro-American, Baltimore, Maryland] all through high school, every summer, every weekend, I was a reporter at the paper or edited something or did something 'cause I liked to write. I mean I really did like to write.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were actually writing in high school?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: You were writing--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I was writing--
Speaker 1: --columns.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was writing in high school, writing in the sixth grade but I was always writing something so I liked to write and so I worked through high school.  I was in--I mean, I say, I wasn't that shy.  I was in Junior Achievement and I won speech contests in Junior Achievement and held an office in that.  I did that in high school too.  And ironically I joined the Junior Achievement group in high school that was--my cousin and I were the only two African Americans in the group, way out in northeast Baltimore [Maryland], where I live now.  We would drive from the city.  It would take us forty minutes to go out to this Junior Achievement meeting, every week.  And so I was always interested in writing.  Always interested in business.  Always interested in public speaking.  So those three things I liked to do in high school.  I don't know, did that answer your question you asked me about the twelfth grade?
Speaker 1: Well, yeah--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --it does.
Speaker 2: I mean I just vividly remember the Junior Achievement.  I also had a lot of responsibility in high school.  My mother --my mother by that time was a single mother, had two younger siblings, and she worked--what was she doing?  I think she--I don't know if she was teaching school then or whether she was at the college by then, but I had a lot of responsibilities so my name was on the checkbooks.  So I was the person that took care of the household bills and things like that and made sure the younger ones, you know, got their work--homework done.
Speaker 1: Well that's significant, you know.  I mean the level of organization, I guess, in the family with the paper, and you know, your exposure to organized life and responsibility at an early age was--
Speaker 2: So I had a lot of--I mean I had fun time but I had, you know, I had things that I needed to take care of too.
Speaker 1: Not a lot of teenagers have that kind of--those kinds of responsibilities of paying the bills and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, paying--I mean my mother would say, you know, here's what I deposited in the bank and here are the bills and, you know, you kind of figure it out.  So, I would just kind of figure it out and then give her the stubs.  We were blessed that she didn't give me more to pay than she put into the account so it, you know, it worked out.  I didn't have to kind of choose to pay this one over that bill.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's--that's a good--it sounds like a good experience and a lot of kids--a lot of teenagers probably did not have, you know.
Speaker 2: But like I said, I was very interested in business and I did hold leadership in Junior Achievement.  I don't remember what it was.  It was--I don't know whether I was the president of that group or vice president of that group but I do know I went--I was the finalist for their speaking contest and got to go someplace nationally to compete in that.
Story_ID: 141458
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so now had you already selected a college or, you know, when you were a senior [at Frederick Douglass High School, Baltimore, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Well, my grandfather [Dr. Carl J. Murphy] was the chair of the board of Morgan State [University, Baltimore, Maryland] so most of us knew that we were going to go to Morgan but my sister was going to go to the University of Wisconsin [Madison, Wisconsin] because my mother [HM Frances Louis Murphy II] said, one of us is going to go.  My brother and I said, not us mom, you know, work on her (laughter) to go to your alma mater.  So I knew that I was going to go to Morgan State pretty early on because my grandfather was trying to encourage as many of us as possible to go to Morgan.  And so I went.  I had a couple of scholarships and I went to Morgan--
Speaker 1: Okay, how'd you like Morgan?
Speaker 2: --and majored in Spanish.
Speaker 1: Did you already know a lot about Morgan?  You probably--well I guess you probably knew--
Speaker 2: Oh, I knew.  My grandparents lived a block east of Morgan where we live now.  Every time there was something significant on campus, you know, my grandfather would gather us all up and, you know, we would go over to the campus for whatever was going on then.
Speaker 1: Okay, so very little surprises--very little in terms of surprises at Morgan State when you went?
Speaker 2: Not too many surprises when I went to Morgan State.  I mean I went to Morgan State in '65 [1965], I think it was, and so went there in '65 [1965], in the fall of--well I started really in that summer.  Went right out of high school in June and went right there that summer.
Speaker 1: Okay, so who were some of the personalities at Morgan State that you remember?
Speaker 2: I remember Robert--Judge [HM] Robert [Mack] Bell because he was the--he now sits on Maryland's highest court [Maryland Court of Appeals].  In fact he's the chief judge.  He was the head of the student government.  So I remember him.  I worked and went to school.  I always carried like eighteen credits and so--then I had married, had a child, all of this in my first couple of years at Morgan so I didn't--I mean I went to class and I remember some of the professors.  Harry Jones in the humanities department.  His wife Ava Jones [ph.].  I remember Dr. Ruthe Sheffey.  I mean she's still there and some other.  I remember Dr. Martin Jenkins, who was the president of the college 'cause he was the kind of hands-on president so we got to see him quite a bit.
Story_ID: 141459
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Did you take French? (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) but I was a commuter student.  Yeah, I was a Spanish major.
Speaker 1: Spanish major, okay, all right.  So, you got--you were really busy in college [at Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: I was busy.  I mean, I was on campus the first year but then I was a, you know, a student who commuted so I was--I was busy.
Speaker 1: So you got married, you met your husband in college?
Speaker 2: I met him in high school.
Speaker 1: High school, okay.
Speaker 2: I met him in [Frederick] Douglass High School [Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 1: All right.  So you were high school sweethearts?
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, you got married your second year in college or first year?
Speaker 2: I got married my second year in college.
Speaker 1: Second year, okay, all right, and you started having babies?
Speaker 2: Yup, one.
Speaker 1: One, okay.
Speaker 2: My children are all spread apart, I had one.
Speaker 1: All right, and taking eighteen credit hours?
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: And working at the paper [Afro-American, later Baltimore Afro-American]?
Speaker 2: But you see I missed a semester when I had the baby, so I was already taking eighteen hours.  So I just kept that pace up and I was on scholarship and I had to maintain a 3.0 [GPA] so I had to do what I had to do to keep my scholarship and to get out in four years.  I wasn't trying to do a five-year program.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause my scholarship didn't work that way.
Speaker 1: So you were able to get out in four years?
Speaker 2: I was able to get out in--four years I was able to graduate number twelve in the class and able to get a job.  I was the only foreign language major to get a job coming out of Morgan [Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] because I had two languages.  I had Spanish and French.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it wasn't--it wasn't popular like it is now.  Now they're begging for foreign language teachers but they weren't at that time.
Story_ID: 141460
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So when did you get a job?  I mean, where--
Speaker 2: I went to work at Herring Run Middle School, it's now called Thurgood Marshall Middle School [Temple Hills, Maryland], which was mostly non-African American children and I stayed there for two years and asked to be transferred to the inner-city so I went to an inner-city school.
Speaker 1: Okay, now why did you ask to be transferred to the inter-city?
Speaker 2: I really felt a calling to teach children of African descent.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I really wanted to do that.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, what school did you end up at?
Speaker 2: I went to Calverton, it's now a middle school, Calverton Junior High School [sic, Calverton Elementary/Middle School, Baltimore, Maryland], right in the heart of the city.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I only stayed in the system, I mean, I taught but I only stayed in the system for five years and two of those years I had student teachers.  So I got to watch other folk teach too and that was good.
Speaker 1: Okay, how long were you at the mostly white school before you transferred?
Speaker 2: Two--I was there two years and then I was at the other school for almost three years.  The teachers went on strike in January of '74 [1974], I remarried in January of '74 [1974] and my mother [HM Frances Louise Murphy II] was running the paper [Afro-American, later Baltimore Afro-American] and they were thinking about closing the New Jersey branch [New Jersey Afro-American] of the paper and I wrote a proposal to see if we could go up there and see really--because nobody knew what was going on, if we could see what was going on and the paper funded that proposal.  So I never went back to teaching.  They stayed on strike and, you know, I took a leave of absence and moved--we moved to New Jersey and started working with the New Jersey Afro.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you actually run the New Jersey Afro--
Speaker 2: I ran the New Jersey paper.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My husband and I stayed there for a couple of years.  It was supposed to be a one-year assignment but we stayed until '76 [1976].  I was pregnant with our first child--with my second child--with our first child in '76 [1976] and we came on back to Baltimore [Maryland].
Story_ID: 141461
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I did a lot of things when I came back to--I came back to Baltimore [Maryland], and this is a true story.  We left the paper, we came back to Baltimore, and we said, okay we gotta work, you know, we can't just--and I knew I didn't want to teach school.  So we were looking in the paper and we saw an ad for account execs for Merrill Lynch and so we both went to this open house and I had the baby in July and this was in September, and we didn't know what we were getting into.  We just went there and so they said, now we're going to have interviews.  And, you know, he had really dressed down for it but I mean I wasn't really, you know, really dressed up but I was more dressed than he was--so we would do this thing, you go, no, you go, no you go.  So I said okay, I'm going, you know, since we're here, I'm going.  And I went into the interview and they hired me to be a stockbroker.  I knew absolutely, positively nothing about that but they were coming out of a class action suit and I had some contacts in Baltimore and so I went to work for Merrill Lynch.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What did you do for Merrill Lynch?
Speaker 2: I was a stockbroker.  I was an account executive in their Baltimore office and, you know, they do a lot of training there and they also would fund your post-graduate work so I got to start my M.B.A. while I was there as well.  And I got--I was offered a job to go to New York [City] and do training for them but I didn't want to leave.  It was--I mean I say that--it's not that I didn't want to leave Baltimore, 'cause you'll find out that we've done a lot of moving but the package they offered was not attractive enough for me to go to New York City and live.  I mean if they offered the same thing to stay in Baltimore, it would probably would have been comfortable with that. It would have not been--I don't think it would not have compensated for what we needed to do to make that kind of move.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, you know, I stayed at Merrill Lynch, here in Baltimore and then Morgan State [University, Baltimore, Maryland] recruited me in their development area to be assistant VP [vice president] of development in university relations.  And so I did that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 141462
Speaker 1: All right.  You're moving fast.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I've done, you know, I've done a lot of things and so I'm trying to--I don't remember if I finished my M.B.A while I was at Merrill Lynch or whether I finished it while I was at--while I was at Morgan State [University, Baltimore, Maryland] but I went to Morgan and I was in that office for a little while.  I don't remember how many years and then after that, let me think, what did I do?  You see, because I went back to the paper [Afro-American, later Baltimore Afro-American, Baltimore, Maryland] back and forth so I don't remember what I did after I left Morgan.  I think I went to a security firm as a vice president of operations, I think that's what I did next.  And I had a cousin, [HM John Jacob] Jake Oliver, who now runs the [Baltimore] Afro [Baltimore Afro-American].  Jake and I are in the same generation and my mother [HM Frances Louise Murphy II] had started a junior board at the Afro but when we became adults, he and I both got elected to the full board of the Afro and in our family, you sat--my grandfather [Dr. Carl J. Murphy] had a horseshoe desk.  He sat in the middle and you sat according to your family.  And so there were twenty-one people on the board.  And so Jake [ph.] and I were always, like, right across from each other, just like you and I are, you know, we would try to figure out what in the world are these folks talking about.  And it was an unwritten rule that you kind of voted along with your family.  So if something came up, you know, you was like a family caucus, you know, like they have the black caucus and you voted along with your family.  But he and I became friends and, I think we broke the rule, you know.  We kind of voted our conscious and did, you know, what we thought was right and we became--we became friends.  This may--I'm not trying to make this complicated either but the family had a voting trust agreement, really.  So even though you voted on the board as an individual, there were certain people that controlled the voting trust who also made appointments to the board and the trust went on for ten years at a time.  And so you served at the pleasure of whatever trustee had the right to name that person to the board.  And so if you were a renegade too many times, you know, you could be removed from that seat.  Jake's family was in the power position of the voting trust.  They had--our family was completely out even though we owned 30 percent of the stock 'cause when my grandfather died, and they formed a new voting trust, 70 percent got together to keep 30 percent out, when in the past, our 30 percent could just couple with 20 percent plus one vote and keep a whole lot of folk out but that's not the way we did it.  We usually had inclusion on the board.  So for ten years, our family, even though we owned 30--almost 40 percent of the stock, didn't have any say so.  We served at the pleasure of somebody else who was in that voting trust.  So one of the aunts who liked me who was on the other side, put me on the board.  But Jake and I became friends and another younger person, we became friends.  And we just started talking about, you know, what it would be like if--what would it be like if we were in charge, kind of thing?  Just fantasizing.  And what would happen if we would--were running this paper.  And we actually went to some venture capitalists and other folk and we actually crafted a plan that said, if we were in charge, this is how much money they would invest in the business but there was one catch.
Story_ID: 141463
Speaker 1: We-- the current regime [at the Afro-American, later Baltimore Afro-American, Baltimore, Maryland] had to--had to go.  The voting trust was about to expire so [HM John Jacob] Jake [Oliver] and myself and another person got another voting trust to succeed that voting trust.  We got that voting trust together to succeed the one that was in existence knowing that it was going to expire.  But that was so--we were eight years into this thing, we went to the current management and said, guess what, we found somebody who could invest.  I don't know how much money it was, I don't know, but it was a significant amount of money into the business, because we knew the business needed a cash infusion.  But here's the catch.  All you all had to retire.  Can you imagine how they looked at us like, you know, you all have lost it.  Now Jake was on the inside by then.  They had hired him as--not hired him but they had-- I guess hired him.  He was assistant vice chair but really what they wanted him to do was wait until all of us decided to retire or leave and then that's when you will ascend to some kind of whatever.  I don't even know how I got into the--oh, I had written a grant or something for somebody to study the business systems or something and we were just friends.  Jake was on the inside, I was on the outside.  I don't remember whether I was at Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland] or where I was but I was on the outside and he was on the inside but when we made that proposal, what they did was they fired him.  Right, he said, okay look, you know, we're still in charge and they had put him actually in another whole building and I remember working with him in that building so I must have come over and worked with him for a little while, or whatever.  I know this sounds kind of convoluted but then I--anyway, we were out.  We were out for the last two years of that trust but we had another trust we were working on anyway that we put in place.  This was in 19--so I can give you some time frame, this was like 1984 and the trust was scheduled to expire in 1986 and so Jake went back to practicing law.  Oh, and then that's when I went to Morgan.  I went to Morgan a second time to teach marketing and management the second time 'cause we knew we had kind of two years to go and we had to work.  So he went--but the arrangement was when these two years is up, you're going to go run the business, Jake Oliver, and I'll still be your friend, I'll be your cousin, I'll be your confidant, I'll serve on your board but I'm going to stay and do what I'm doing, you know, I'm going to continue teaching college and do what I'm doing.  And so that was the deal.  So in 1986, I guess around March or so, the other part of the family knew we had this voting trust.  They knew that this was in place and they understood that come October '86 [1986], things were going to change.  And so they tried all kinds of things.  They tried selling the assets.  They tried issuing more stock which would have diluted our position.  We had to come up with something like thirty or forty thousand dollars in thirty days to buy the extra stock that they put on the table.  We had to get a temporary restraining order.  We had to do all kinds of things in these six months leading up to October 1986.  But it came and Jake says, "I don't think I'm going to leave the law firm."  I'm like, "What?"  You know we've done all this.  We're getting ready to, not inherit, but the reins are getting ready to be transferred to us to run this business that both of us had been out of for at least two years.  Didn't have a clue now.  We didn't know what we were doing.  He said, "Well, I can't leave the law firm."  I said, "But somebody's got to run this business, Oliver."  He said, "Well you do it."  I said, "Me?  I'm not supposed to be doing this.  You're supposed to be doing this."  So, to make a long story short, that's how I got to be president of the paper, almost by default, 'cause I had told them I would help him to run it.  So I went there in October '86 [1986].  We--I mean we didn't have a clue and all of the senior management who was not family--in the family--family too, they quit and when they had voted Jake out, the vote was by one vote.  Remember I told you I voted my two years and he fired that one person who didn't vote for him so we really didn't have a clue.
Story_ID: 139443
Speaker 1: Now you assumed con-- charge of the [Baltimore] Afro-American and this is in 1986? (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (simultaneous) Eighty-six [1986].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In 1986 and I think that we were talking about is, you know, we assumed control of it in 1986, senior management either left or was asked to leave rather, and so we really didn't have that kind of support.  We really didn't know what was going on.  We really didn't have a clue as to what was going on.  And I think when I talked about the stock that was issued that would have changed the parity and we had to pull that money together in thirty days, we came on the thirtieth day to make that delivery after everybody, you know, agreeing to borrow as much as we can and we pooled our resources and we were told that our cousin, John [Oliver, Sr.], was not there and we, you know, we're thinking, well, you know it's five o'clock, we wanted to make that deadline.  We knew the building well so we went up the back steps and went into that back door and he was there and we made the delivery.  And so he knew at that time that this particular era was over and we respect John for what he had done for the paper.  It wasn't that it was adversarial, it's any time that control is shifting from one place to the next, it's always a struggle in-between and--but I have to say truly, we did not know--we did not have the depth of background or anything else to know how to run that business.  It was, you know, it was more like we figured it out, we had been clever enough to do some things and to make it work but then it got to the day of, okay, now you're actually here, now what are you going to do?  You have to deliver.  And then there was a shift because, as I said, [HM John Jacob] Jake [Oliver] had decided not to leave the law firm.
Story_ID: 139444
Speaker 1: Now was it a case where you had kind of looked at it from, not really the complete outside, but looked at it and said, well, I know things can be done better than this--
Speaker 2: Well, we had done that from the inside--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and we had gotten some financial backing to help to finance the plan but when that didn't happen in '84 [1984], when we went back to those people in '86 [1986], they were no longer interested.  So not only did we not know what had transpired on the inside, internally in two years, the plan that we had crafted to kind of take the paper [Baltimore Afro-American, Baltimore, Maryland] to another level, the funders were no longer interested and the cash flow of the paper could not support that ambitious a plan at the time.  And we didn't know what--we really didn't--I mean two years had elapsed and so we really didn't know what the condition of the paper was, other than what we had received as shareholders, and you know you get what you get as a shareholder or as a board member.  You don't get all of the intricacies of being on the inside.  And so it was pretty--pretty interesting those first few months just trying to figure out who's who.  Some of the same people weren't there any longer.  We didn't know all the systems.  We no longer were printing, which was a blessing, because you know, neither one of us knew about presses.  We knew about journalism but we had to couple that with the business things that we needed to do.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you had to farm out the--
Speaker 2: Well, the printing--
Speaker 1: --printing, okay.
Speaker 2: --had been farmed out.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, the presses had not run for a long time but can you imagine now this is 1986 and the business is not computerized either.
Speaker 1: Were they still using a line of technicians?
Speaker 2: Oh, they're still using a lot of things.  They had a Compugraphics 8400 at the time and they had some new equipment there but, you know, nobody wanted to plug it in and figure out how to do it and so, you know, we had to convert--I mean there were still--there were no computers, not even desktop computers for anything so that was a big challenge for us to convince folk, you know--we never did convince Sam Lacy, and that was okay.
Speaker 1: That's the famous sportswriter, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know he just passed but we never--we didn't worry with Sam Lacy because he didn't even use typewriter much.  He hand wrote his copy and it always fit perfectly and he was always ontime because he would come to work at three and four o'clock in the morning and get his column done and go out, you know, shoot eighteen holes of golf, so, but other people, you know, really needed to--to transition over to the computer age.  But that took--that takes resources so we had to try to garner some resources to bring the company up, you know, even to the '80s [1980s], into the '90s [1990s].  So we had a lot of challenges in trying to do that.
Story_ID: 139445
Speaker 1: Okay, well, the story that I read about is that you were able to--you were successful and you've been--you received praise for being able to turn the paper [Baltimore Afro-American, Baltimore, Maryland] around.  How did you do it?
Speaker 2: Well, trial--the beginning of it was trial and error.  So we made some mistakes at the beginning, you know, but over time we were just good--I think good students of best practices.  We talked to other people.  [HM John Jacob] Jake [Oliver] was convinced, I think, to not just practice--I mean, to give up the law practice and come back.  I mean maybe that was about a year or so later that he came back.  He suffered an illness in the fall of '86 [1986] that took him out of everything, law practice, and everything else.  And so--but just studying best--traveling, talking to other people and trying to do what we did best which was cover the African American community and then focus on the business in the advertising and make those contacts.  So we just kind of plodded through and then we tried to attract capable people, especially in those areas that we didn't have the expertise, which were many because when I said everybody left, I mean the--eventually--the only person that stayed was the business manager but eventually he left, too.  So that was the person who was making up the head of production, that was the head of advertising, you know, all the--the head of editorial, I mean those people who were part of the former administration had made up their minds that they were not going to be there.  Now some people--some people stayed but not the senior people, not the senior management people.
Speaker 1: Okay, now that--it seems like maybe a--that could be problematic on a number of different ways when all those people leave and some of them, I suppose, were angry, that's why they left.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: And they felt that the paper changed or the direction of it had changed or something--I don't know.
Speaker 2: Well, I think--you don't know but some of it I believe was because of the--if I don't know--if I'd been some place for twenty years and I know this administration and how they run, and I don't know who these young folk are, these thirty-somethings that, you know, kind of been in and out over their--over their lives and haven't, you know, as far as we can see, don't bring that much to the party I, maybe I better move and do something different.
Story_ID: 139446
Speaker 1: Okay, so did it, did it create, like a, public relations kind of problem in the black community about--
Speaker 2: Well, the transition didn't--that transition by itself didn't create it but what did create a problem was once we really got our hands around the business, and after that business manager left and we were able to really see what was going on in the business, we knew that unlike my mother [HM Frances Louise Murphy II] giving me bills to pay where I had enough money where the income exceeded the outgo, that wasn't the case at the paper [Baltimore Afro-American, Baltimore, Maryland] and so there was a lot of debt that had allowed to be built up because the way the business was managed was, if you had--if you presented an invoice to the company, they would make up the check and everything and then pile it up and stick it under their desk.  I mean, when I got to that desk, there were little soda cartons full of stuff and so if somebody called and said, when you going to pay me my whatever, if you called enough, then somebody would reach down there and say, okay, let's release this one, let's release that one.  That--I mean, that's--and that wasn't my management style but that's how it was managed but we didn't know the extent because on the books, it was already expensed in office if it was paid or if it--no, no, take it back the other way, it never hit the books yet.  It just never hit the books yet until it was released, that's the way because it was a cash basis.  And so you never got a--if you look at the financial stuff, the company looked really healthy.  Well, you hadn't taken into account the stuff that was under the desk and I couldn't even stretch my legs out so I was like, this stuff can't stay under the desk.  So that was one of the reasons that we knew that the business manager, even though he had stayed and didn't leave with everybody else, that he needed to transition out of that position.  And so we got a--by the time we got a handle on everything, what we found out was that a whole lot of things weren't being paid, taxes, I mean, just a whole lot of things weren't being taken care of and so what we did was we crafted what was called a composition plan where you would go to your creditors and ask them to take so much on a dollar so the business could stay functional and viable and you had to throw up a word that nobody likes to throw up and say well you know, if this doesn't work, then perhaps we have to declare bankruptcy and that's all people heard. So that created a public relations nightmare because even though we met with creditors in good faith and said, look, we've been here a year, this is what we're finding, this is what we think we need to do to stay in business, and we'd already talked to the larger creditors who have said, here we're going to work with you.  The big one, your printers, they'll tell you--they'd already agreed before we had this meeting.  It's the smaller ones that decided, well maybe I'll call the Washington Post, maybe I'll call the Baltimore Sun and we will put it--this is the spin we're going to put on it, that the Afro [Baltimore Afro-American, Baltimore, Maryland] is going out of business.  Well, that wasn't true at all but that's the--so then we have a public relations nightmare in the middle of trying to work out things with creditors.  So distracting and so destructive.  That's--because the large--the people that you really owed some money to, they'd already agreed before you had the public meeting and so--so you spend your time talking to reporters about, was it true that you're going out of business?  Well, no it's not true.  We're trying--and so--just so destructive.  That was a public relations nightmare because once that gets out there and it's not correct, you can spend a whole lot of time trying to correct bad press but people hear in soundbites and they read halfway and you get it into your mind and your spirit that that's the way it is and it is difficult to turn the trend around.  But all we could do was put the truth out there and then continue to--in fact, I'm going to tell you how--how--we had to turn it to a public relations advantage because then people started calling and saying, "What can we do to save the paper?"  So our first response was, but it's not like--quite like that.  But then after a while we said, okay, wait a minute, people want to do something, let's allow them to do.  So we crafted, or started, Operation Afro where people could subscribe and do that type of thing.  And some people actually wanted to write checks to the paper to help redeem its debt, if you would.  And so some people did that.  And at first as I said, we resisted that because we had worked out something but then, you know, it was like okay, let's involve the public, let's involve our support as people want to be involved.  We'll tell them the truth of what's going on 'cause we weren't really asking for money.  We'd rather see them translate that into subscriptions, build a subscription base, 'cause that would help our bottom line as well as build our credibility up with our advertiser and then get the product into their hands.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: So that was Operation Afro.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Well, as people saw--see the Afro-American as an institution, you know, and that's a good thing.
Speaker 2: And it's an institution that's been like most institutions through storms and through all kinds of things.  If you can imagine--first of all, great-grandfather [John H. Murhpy, Sr] starting it in 1892, that was a storm.  Folk went off to war, that was a storm.  We went through the Great Depression, that was a storm.  I mean, you had so--in our business and in our culture, most of us understand storms and we know there is a, you know, a rainbow on the other side if you can just persevere and stay with it so--I don't know who said this but, you know, tough times never last last, just tough people.
Story_ID: 139447
Speaker 1: Now di-- how did things change?  Did the circulation increase [at the Baltimore Afro-American, Baltimore, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess--I mean a lot of things changed, I mean, certainly you had to get a handle on your business practices.  You had to get that together.  The circulation changed some.  What happens in an African American publication or most weeklies, not just African American, is that you build readership and your readership base is not all subscriber base because our weekly publications, as well as our monthlies, get passed around.  You know, you go into a barbershop, the hairdresser, somebody else's house, and you read the Afro [Baltimore Afro-American] or whatever other publication is there and you become part of the readership base.  So the readership increased and then those who are in influential positions, so to speak, almost every congressperson, every state legislature, later or rather, subscribe to the paper and so your influence base increased as well.  And suddenly that translates to some circulation but statistics have shown that most African American publications get passed through four hands and the shelf life is longer.  So your daily paper, you tend to throw it away, I mean, you don't just stockpile it for weeks and weeks, but you could go in people's homes and find the Afro-American and other African American publications that have been just around for a while.
Story_ID: 139448
Speaker 1: Okay, now once you got the paper [Baltimore Afro-American] in a healthy position--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --you pursued other things.  You went into the ministry and--
Speaker 2: I did--
Speaker 1: --how did you--
Speaker 2: --I was already pretty involved in my work with the church when I went to the paper.  And then in 1990, '91 [1991], I accepted my call to ministry but I stayed at the paper.  I mean, I still stayed there and I served as an associate minister at one church and then at another church behind that.  And so I did--I did the paper still pretty much full-time and that was my vocation and I worked in the church as my avocation until I really was convinced it was in--let's see, I left the paper--what year are we, 2003?  I left the paper totally in 1998, December of 1998.  So I think it was '97 [1997] or so when I was real clear that God was calling me to come out altogether.  I mean, we had this kind of running dialogue, "You want me to do what?  Leave and do what, God?  No, I don't think so, you know."  We had this little battle going on back and forth in my spirt anyway, in my mind, and so I thought, you know, could I could always come up with an idea--man, I said well, I'll tell you what, God I'll just take a--how about this, God, I'll take a sabbatical.  I'll work half-time at the paper and half-time in the church and we made that announcement.  It was in the paper that that's what I was going to do.  I was going to leave for a little while.  I mean, just to come--some part-time stuff but in September I was just convicted that that's not what God was telling me to do.  And my daughter was getting married in October and we had just bought a house and she kind of looked at me and said, "Mom, what are you thinking about?"  I said, "I'm just trying to be obedient of what God has said," and so that's--that's what happened.  But I didn't--I didn't pastor right away but I was in ministry full-time and so I'd been blessed to be able to travel to a lot of places to preach like England and all over the country before I was appointed here to--to this church [John Wesley A.M.E. Zion Church, later, Freedom Temple A.M.E. Zion Church, Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 1: Now how did you get on that level of activity so quick and then you're traveling to England?  I mean--
Speaker 2: I mean, it's--I mean the credit goes to God.  I mean, I didn't really--I mean I was a willing vessel, amen, and God uses me in the ways that he wants to use me.  Because I was an associate--I don't know whether it was because I was an associate minister at two churches, the one for five years and the other one for seven years.
Speaker 1: Are these the same denominations?
Speaker 2: One was a non-denominational church and the interesting thing was I was in the A.M.E. Zion Church and left with a young pastor to start a non-denominational church and God sent me back to the [John Wesley] A.M.E. Zion Church [later, Freedom Temple A.M.E. Zion Church, Baltimore, Maryland], but in those capacities I had a lot of opportunity to preach because if people would call for someone to preach at the church, the pastors usually couldn't go, they would send one of the associates to go.  Or in my own right, I started another ministry called God's Love Ministry, another friend of mine in ministry and I did.  And so we started ministering to, particularly to women, and we would have women's conferences and so out of those conferences we'd be invited to preach different places and--
Story_ID: 139449
Speaker 1: And now, now what inspired you to--to life as a pastor?  I mean, what did you see that you--
Speaker 2: Well, what I--what I came to realize is that I had a calling to shepherd people through their Christian experience, to be there for them.  I am a licensed--or certified, rather pastoral counselor.  I had, you know, pursued that educationally as well and in those interactions what I seem to, I don't even want to use the word enjoy, but what I seemed to be most fulfilled in, was shepherding people through a process but not doing a one-on-one totally clinical, in the office all the time, kind of counseling because if you haven't figured it out by now, holding still is not something that--in confines, I like outdoor spaces, you know, I like outreach.  I like it when, for example--I started this before you asked that question, I didn't remember but now I'm going to bring this in, when two of our more prominent pastors here had a crusade, for example, at the stadium, it was a crusade of religious crusade, I felt that it should be something beyond the crusade and so we had something called Beyond the Crusade where we would go out and just evangelize, you know, door-to-door, neighborhood-by-neighborhood, you know.  After a while my husband got used to that I was going to get up at Saturday morning and go down to the drug-infested places of our community and just knock on doors and talk to people about Jesus and, you know, see where we could give some assistance.  And I did that until I got frostbitten pretty good and so I don't do it to the same extent.  I learned not to do it in the middle of the winter without being properly clothed but still enjoy a lot of going out and just spreading the good news and then seeing people grow in their relationship with Christ.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I kind of grew into it out of those things that God would call me to do and that I felt it was the right fit.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now most of the door-to-door activity in the black community, comes from Jehovah Witnesses [sic, Jehovah's Witnesses]--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --knocking on your door--
Speaker 2: -No doubt about it.
Speaker 1: --and asking and--
Speaker 2: That's the first question we get.  You know, you had to tell somebody we're not the Jehovah's Witnesses.
Speaker 1: Right, well they approach it like an army.  They get out there and they knock--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --on the doors and, you know, you can pretty much determine if you hadn't--you didn't know somebody was coming and then somebody's knocking on the door on a Saturday or Sunday, that it's the Jehovah's Witnesses.
Speaker 2: No doubt about it.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So we encountered a lot of--we encountered Jehovah's Witnesses on the street, which was fine, you know, but a lot of people who thought we were also Jehovah's Witnesses--Christians are called to witness too, we just don't do it as much.  I mean I have a story about a--we actually got into a lady's home one time and she was a retired pastor, but very depressed because she had become ill and couldn't pastor anymore and her bed was in the living room and she had the covers pulled up.  I mean, she talked with us--with two of us for a long time and when she finally got comfortable, she took her hand from under her covers and she said, "Now I can put my gun away."  We said, "Good," (laughter).  We're glad that you're--so, we encountered all kinds of stuff, you know.  You know, folk putting, you know-'cause we would actually go into people's homes and tried to meet people where they were, if they would allow us to do that.  And many people would.
Story_ID: 139450
Speaker 1: Yeah, nowadays, well, you know, door-to-door work is--outreach work is, you know, is--and we think about the Civil Rights Movement, that's how--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --they were able to organize people to vote in Mississippi and Alabama--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and other places by going door-to-door, knocking on doors and agitating people about changing--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --their life.
Speaker 2: We go out twice a month here at the church [John Wesley A.M.E. Zion Church, later, Freedom Temple A.M.E. Zion Church, Baltimore, Maryland].  We go out the fourth Saturday which is this week and the second Sunday.  And so some people go out door-to-door, some just go out on the street, some stay in here and pray, you know, we're not--we want people to be--we believe that people should stay in their lanes, stay in your gifting areas, stay where you're comfortable, but in this neighborhood, right here where this church is, there's so much despair, so much drug addiction, so much illness, so much physical illness too.  So much HIV/AIDS, I mean just--it's just a lot in this community.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the neighborhood does--it looks depressed, I mean, when you look at it, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's pretty depressed.  Hopkins [John Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland] is going to revitalize it with this bio-medical park and there's a major plan for doing that but in the meantime, there are still people who are living here.  And so as the houses are torn down, as the rats are running as you know, as the kids are trying to get educated, so we ran a summer program this summer for kids.  We have a computer lab downstairs.  Just trying to reach out to the community.
Speaker 1: And so you invite them to come into the church?
Speaker 2: Just like they are.  Just come like you are, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so even on that second Sunday when we go out, that's our dress-down Sunday.  You know, I'll put my jeans on.  Just come like, you know, we're not--we're not really about what you got going on the outside, it's about what you got going on the inside.
Story_ID: 139451
Speaker 1: Okay, now that's a lot of the churches in the inner-city communities around the country, and Chicago [Illinois], and New York [City] and other places are--the population of the church actually live someplace else now.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: And they come into church on Sunday and then they go back to the 'burbs or wherever they're from.  But this is a--you had a church population you said of seven people there [at John Wesley A.M.E. Zion Church, later, Freedom Temple A.M.E. Zion Church, Baltimore, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: We had eight people--
Speaker 1: Eight.
Speaker 2: --when I came here last September.  There were eight people and now we have about seventy-five people.  And I guess out of that seventy-five, anywhere from forty to fifty come on a regular basis.  Our members, who are from the neighborhood, most of them are struggling to get out of the neighborhood.  We have one member--speaking of Chicago, we have one member who moved here from Chicago and from December or January when she moved here until this Monday, she's been in a shelter, just going through the housing and the Section 8 and all of the craziness that's gone on but she's finally in an apartment.  Now in the interim, her husband has been arrested, he's in jail for possession and got all that kind of stuff going on but--and a member of the church is going to donate a bed to her but they haven't gotten it to her yet.  She says, "Pastor, I'm going to make a pallet.  I am just so glad to be in my own place."  And she now has moved maybe half hour, forty-five minute bus ride from here but she's, you know, still coming back to the church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And active in the church and bringing other people from the shelter and other people from the neighborhood.  I mean, I don't--I don't know any other way to do ministry if we don't empower the people who are right here. So they, if they choose to, can go to the suburbs, if they choose to.  But I'm an inner-city person.  We live, my husband and I, lived in Columbia [Maryland] for--Maryland for six or seven years and I really did not--you know, I didn't like it.  I spent all my time on [interstate] 95 or 29 coming back to the city [Baltimore, Maryland].  I'm just, you know, I just--I like urban ministry.  I'm called to urban ministry.
Story_ID: 139452
Speaker 1: Okay, now that's quite a commitment.  So what you're doing here when you build a congregation of a church in a neighborhood is that you're--do you see some of the building the neighborhood too--
Speaker 2: Build a neighborhood.  And in one of families, there are four little boys, eight, six, four and two or--I think I have the ages right, and last night I stopped by to drop these pictures off so I wouldn't forget and they knocked on the door and we have pictures of our members out on the board--the little boy said, "How come my picture's not up on the board?"  I said, "Well those are the people that have joined the church."  He said, "But I've been coming around to this church, Pastor Toni, doesn't that qualify me to be a member?"  I said, "Let's talk to your parents."  So I said, "If your mom and dad say it's all right, that qualifies you to be a member, you know."  He said, "I want my picture up there."  I said, "No problem.  No problem."  But he's one of the first--when I first came [to John Wesley A.M.E. Zion Church, later, Freedom Temple A.M.E. Zion Church, Baltimore, Maryland], he's one of the first people that I met, this little eight-year-old boy.
Story_ID: 139453
Speaker 1: Now are most of the people that you're able to reach out to and bring into the church [John Wesley A.M.E. Zion Church, later, Freedom Temple A.M.E. Zion Church, Baltimore, Maryland], older people or younger people?
Speaker 2: Most of them are younger people.  We only have active two people that are over sixty in the whole church.  So, a lot of single moms with younger children.  So we don't have a lot of teenagers--it's kind of--we don't have a lot of teenagers because the average age is around thirty-five.  So we have little children, of course, that are going to grow up to be teenagers.  We'll cross the teenage thing when we get to it but most of them are thirty-five, most of them are single, not all women.  Even our--even the men, a lot of them are single too.
Speaker 1: So do you try to make opportunities for them to--
Speaker 2: Fellowship?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Is that the word you were looking for?
Speaker 1: Yes, I suppose that's it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well we have fellowship.  For example, last week I invited everybody to my house.  It was my first anniversary and, you know, it was our dress-down, hit the street day anyway, and I said, well let's just come by and have a cookout, and they did.
Story_ID: 142429
Speaker 1: Well, our vision statement of the church [John Wesley A.M.E. Zion Church, later, Freedom Temple A.M.E. Zion Church, Baltimore, Maryland] says that we want to have spirit-filled worship, creative community outreach and then we want to be a catalyst for business development in this community.  We want to teach people how to fish, not keep fishing for them.  I mean, it seems--it's a travesty to just give people--just hand out this and hand out that and they never learn the skillset.  They never have the opportunity to learn how to do things for themselves.  And so this church, I would--I--for example would hope that we could do some kind of business venture here but as a venture that we can employ people, teach them some skills so that they can make contributions, not just to the community but for their own selves.  Generation after generation you have people all they know is the handout system and so all day long we'll get people that'll come and say, you know, I got this situation and that situation, this situation and such, fine, I might help you with your situation but let me talk to you first about what's really going on.  You know, some people don't want you to get that deep but let's talk about what's going on 'cause really, most of us are going from church to church to church with the same sad story, month after month after month but at what point are you going to get tired of that and at what point do you really want to change and turn your life around.  So, our theme is that the John Wesley Church [later, Freedom Temple A.M.E. Zion Church, Baltimore, Maryland] is a church where lives are being changed, where hurts are being healed and where hope is being restored.  You know, we've got to interact with folk and not do the surface thing of, you know, just give you a handout, we need to give you a hand up.  We'll walk with you.  It's a brother that's a member of our church, you know, and he, "Pastor, I really want to get my life together.  I really want some help."  Okay, but what are you willing to do?  So when we found the detox place for you, and you didn't want to go because that was inconvenient, it was across town, what do you really want to do?  I want to love you to life.  I don't want to cripple you and enable you to stay in your lifestyle.  So we kind of adopt that philosophy of ministry that we'll be with you all the way through.  You gotta go to court, we'll go to court with you.  You know, we'll do whatever needs to be done but not to just enable you to stay dependent on somebody else--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --other than God.  You know, get us get dependent on God, let's do some things to change some things.
Story_ID: 142430
Speaker 1: Okay, this is a standard question we always ask and that is, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Okay, I kind of articulated some of those, but my, but my hope and concerns, and when I--for the black community first of all is that we would understand who God is 'cause I think, and I really believe, that when we have a personal relationship with the Lord, and allow him to be ruling in and over our lives, we'll make different choices when we start to understand that.  And out of that--an outgrowth of that would be that we would then develop our skills and talents for the benefit of ourselves and for others in the community.  And so, you know, we've heard this phrase thrown around [Baltimore, Maryland] about unity in the community, I don't think that we all are one flavor.  I mean, I think that we were created differently but because we're different doesn't mean that we're deficient, it just means that we're different and so that we could work together for the betterment of somebody else and so my hope is, and it may be a little idealistic, but that there really wouldn't be any lack even in the church.  I mean, why should I have an abundance and then you don't have anything?  You know, we've got to figure out how to kind of level the playing field some because so much talent is either in jail or in the cemetery.  Well I can't do anything about what's in the cemetery except for try not to, you know, see anybody else go there but the talent's that's in prison, doesn't need to be used that way.  And so I've even talked to some, for example, some of the so-called, big guys in the drug world 'cause I'm not afraid to go out and talk to them.  And we have some that have joined the church [John Wesley A.M.E. Zion Church, later, Freedom Temple A.M.E. Zion Church, Baltimore, Maryland], you know, about, you know, where do you want your life to be and how do you transfer what you're doing now in the street to something meaningful where you're not always looking over your shoulder, afraid to open up your door, thinking somebody's going to put a gun to your head.  I mean, how do we do those kinds of things?  So, that would be a goal, I think, for the black community.  And I believe that this whole drug addiction thing if we--it's a treatment issue.  It's a treatment issue.  It's not a--it's not a penal institution issue but we're not really attacking it as a treatment issue.  You know, it's a hit or miss thing for most folk, can't even get into the kind of treatment that they need to do.  So--
Speaker 1: Yeah, meanwhile the prisons are stockpiling--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, prisons are stockpiling.  You know, people don't have fair representation.  All those same issues are there so my hope for the black community is that we, as individuals and collectively, would be all that God intended for us to do and we would just take advantage of every opportunity that's there to do that.  And that in the religious community, the church community, we would take our focus off of ourselves and put our focus on God first and on other folk and stop building our own little dynasties 'cause I don't think God is pleased with a lot that's going on.
Story_ID: 142431
Speaker 1: Okay, when you look back on the things that you have done, and you're still fairly young--
Speaker 2: I knew I liked you.
Speaker 1: Okay, what would you consider at this point as your legacy?
Speaker 2: As my legacy, I think that one part of my legacy is that I'm not just a person that tells you to do as I say, that I try to teach by example.  And I'm not afraid to roll up my sleeves and to actually do the work as opposed to just delegating the work.  So I think that's a legacy.  I think the other legacy is that I interact with the least likely, you know, the castaways, the people that folks say are not going to be nothin', can't be anything, I'm more attracted to working with--with people who fit that kind of description.  And the other thing is, maybe this should have been first, and maybe it's all part of the same thing, pushing people to their purpose, you know, pushing people to their purpose.  So whether or not you're at the lower rung, or whether you--I mean, you could be an executive, you know, some place, and if that's not your purpose and we are kind of talkin' about it because I'm not afraid to change, and so pushing people to their purpose, pushing people to do what it is that God has preordained for them to do and not just be stuck some place and think that that's their only option.
Story_ID: 142432
Speaker 1: Okay, is there anything that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: In my whole life?  Well, there's probably a whole lot of things I would do differently (laughter).  There's probably a whole lot of things I'd do differently.  I probably wouldn't have slammed my brother's fingers in the door and broken his fingers if I thought about that real good but wasn't trying to hurt him just, you know--so there's a lot of things I do probably would have done differently.  But I believe that every experience that I had was a stepping stone for the next thing.  The Bible says that tribulation leads to patience and when you have patience it leads to experience and experience to hope.  And so we got to go through things in order to get to the hope at the other end.
Story_ID: 142433
Speaker 1: Speaking of tribulation, you told a story during the break of you and your brother as guinea pigs--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --basically during the Civil Rights Movement.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And that--and being an innocent--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --trying to understand what was going on.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Can you explain that?
Speaker 2: Well, the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]--my understanding is that they had filed a class action suit, I believe, to integrate a park, here in Maryland, called Fort Smallwood Park [Pasadena, Maryland] and as part of their case, they needed some visuals in terms of the treatment that African Americans got at this public park and so we were loaded into a station wagon and driven to this park by our parents [HM Frances Louise Murphy II and James Edward Wood, Sr.].  I think I was four or five years old, six maybe, and I just vividly remember people just yelling, you know, racial things and saying unkind things, and actually throwing bricks and things at the station wagon, and it was a pretty traumatic experience.  It didn't keep me away from being active, though, in the Civil Rights Movement, you know, almost by default we were--we were expected to do it 'cause if nobody else's child would go then, you know, our parents would say or my grandfather [Dr. Carl J. Murphy] would say, well, you know, get some children.  We've got some children in the family.  They can walk the picket line or, you know, they can get into the car.  And so--
Speaker 1: And so you're thrown into it early.
Speaker 2: Early, early, early age of leading by example, early age.
Story_ID: 142434
Speaker 1: And you're just a--observation that you--you come from a family that's, you know, well-known in Baltimore [Maryland], has money, status with the [Baltimore] Afro-American newspaper and yet is still close to the pulse of what's going on--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --at the, you know, because of the paper, I think--
Speaker 2: Well, see, I think it's a myth that--I think it's a myth that the people have that the family has money, status, prestige, I think so, because, you know, you're in media you get that type of thing and plus our family members were activists in the community.  So, we stay in the pulse of the community because we were taught to keep it real, to understand that we're no better than anybody else and so just because you've got this name, doesn't mean anything.  And I went out--I mean, I think I probably took it to the extreme.  When I went to high school [at Frederick Douglass High School, Baltimore, Maryland], especially, people would come to you and they'd say, you look like so and so.  You one of those and I'd say, "Oh, nope, wrong person, wrong family" until my mother [HM Frances Louise Murphy II] would say, would you stop.  She said, I heard that you'd been out there disowning us.  I said, I'm not disowning I said but I don't want to be known by somebody's else's--I'm not disowning the legacy and I appreciate everything that everybody's done for us but I don't want that to be my claim to fame.  I don't want it to be that I'm somebody's daughter, somebody's granddaughter, that that's the only contribution I've made is because of what somebody else has done, I appreciate it, we stand on their shoulders, we, you know, we're proud of everything that everybody's done but that's not really how I want to be known.  Now we've had some cousins--I had, you know, one that called Thurgood Marshall and said, my grandfather [Dr. Carl J. Murphy] helped you get in law school, help me.  Well, that just wasn't my way of doing things.  Or my name is Murphy so I don't want to wait in the doctor's office, I want to be pushed to the top of the list.  That just wasn't how I choose to operate.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so people who know the family connection for me, they know it because they know it and I have people now that will come up and say, "I didn't know".  Well, that's not the first thing I choose to lead with, I'm not trying to impress you that way.  I probably wouldn't have done this if somebody hadn't put my name--it took me long enough.  This is like the third appointment.  I'm just not that--I'm not a limelight kind of person.
Story_ID: 142435
Speaker 1: Okay, now, this leads to the last question which is similar to legacy but not quite the same and that is, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I'd like to be remembered as a servant of God.  You can just put that on my tombstone, you know, "Here lies Frances Draper, a servant of Jesus Christ," and that'll say a lot.
Speaker 1: Okay, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: You're welcome very much.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 142436
Speaker 1: Just give us a brief description of the photo, left to right.  We put them sideways like this because they scan better.
Speaker 2: They may scan better but my eyes don't fool with them.  Let me see, what is the picture--
Speaker 1: Look at the (unclear).
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, that's a--that's a fortieth birthday picture and the gentleman to my right is my father [James Edward Wood, Sr.] and to my left is my husband, Andre and we had a celebration, it was called Friends at Forty and seven or eight of us who had been friends a long time decided to have a collective birthday party, and that's what that was.
Speaker 1: Okay, next.
Speaker 2: This is a picture probably in December--January--December 1954--January, 1955 of me holding my sister, Sue [Susan Barnes].
Speaker 1: Very good.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my mother [HM Frances Louise Murphy II] and I, well I guess I just see me--my mother and I in Druid Hill Park, here in Baltimore [Maryland].
Speaker 1: Year?
Speaker 2: Probably--I'm guessing, I'd have to look on the back and see the year--it's about--is it on the back?
Speaker 1: Yeah, '51 [1951].
Speaker 2: Fifty-one [1951].
Speaker 1: Could you put the photo back so I could finish focusing on it.
Speaker 2: It's 1951.
Speaker 1: Great, next.
Speaker 2: I think these are all about the same time.  Are they 1951?  That's my dad, my brother, Jimmy [Dr. James E. Wood, Jr.], and myself.  Again, that's--I think that's an Easter photo around '51 [1951].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's also a picture around Easter time.  My mother and my brother, Jimmy, and myself.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my girlfriend, Pat, my mother and myself, I'm in the middle, when we went to a Nina Simone concert at Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland], probably around '67 [1967], '68 [1968], somewhere in there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is a 1974 photo of my marriage to my husband of nearly thirty years, Andre and our sons, Kevin [ph.], who was the older of the two and Andre [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of myself, my mother and some other young ladies at Morgan in around 1967 as I was going on the Delta [Sigma Theta], either--well, I don't think I was going on the line, I think this was when I'd gone over as a Delta, 'cause we have sorority pins on, so, yeah, it's already done.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my mother and myself.  I think this--she was 1969 and we were at a black arts festival.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This picture was taken in December of 1973 and I'm in the red sweater, next to myself is my daughter, Andrea [ph.], behind Andrea is my oldest son, Kevin, my husband in the middle, my son Andre and the little one is Aaron [ph.].
Speaker 1: Got it.
Speaker 2: This is some kind of costume party at nursery school, 1949, and I am the second from the left and my cousin, Jill [ph.], is in the middle and my cousin Vashti [Turley Murphy] is on the end.
Speaker 1: Next.
Speaker 2: This is a color shot of the same wedding photo with my husband and myself and our sons, Kevin and Andre, and that's January of 1974.
Speaker 1: All right, next.
Speaker 2: I'm not sure of the year of this, probably around 1957, that's myself and my sister, Susan, in the middle, my brother Jimmy.  We are in our living room at the piano.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We have a lot of childhood pictures left.  Do you want to kind of choose which one you want?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We got the naked baby picture.
Speaker 1: Give us a description on this one.
Speaker 2: This is my mother and my Aunt Betty [ph.] and my brother Jimmy, myself in the middle, my cousin Marie [ph.] who is also a pastor, are in that picture.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is a May Day picture at Grimke [Elementary] School [later, Grimke School, Washington, D.C.].  I'm not sure of the year.  It's probably around 1952 or three [1953] and I am the one, two, three, fourth child from the left.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my dad and my brother and I at our home in Richmond [Virginia] and the year is probably 1950, '49 [1949], '50 [1950].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is another dress-up party thing at nursery school around 1949 and I am the little girl on the left on the front row, the first girl.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is a birthday party.  I'm not sure of the year.  I think it's around '51 [1951] and I'm standing up and my mother is also in the background.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: This looks like another kind of birthday celebration.  There are one, two, three, four candles on the--four candles on the cake--four or five.
Speaker 1: Yup, it looks like four.
Speaker 2: Looks like four, okay, so that's got to be 1951.  Nineteen fifty-one [1951] was a good year for pictures.
Speaker 1: Go ahead, this one is photo number twenty.
Speaker 2: Okay, these are my parents, James Wood and Frances Murphy, Wood at the time, and this has to be December '47 [1947].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Here's a naked baby picture.
Speaker 1: Oh, and that has to be December '47 [1947], too.  That's gotta be.  Not much further--it could be, it could be the early part of '48 [1948].  It could be the early part.
Speaker 2: Okay, next.
Speaker 1: Two here.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's my mother there, Frances Murphy and then this is my brother and I.  I think this photo of him in the fire truck and me in the cowboy girl hat, or cowgirl hat, were used for a Christmas card and the year is probably--the year's on the back of the pictures, probably '51 [1951], '52 [1952].
Speaker 1: Next.
Speaker 2: This is a first grade picture.  That's my teacher, Ms. Carter, [ph.] at Grimke Elementary School in Washington [D.C.].
Speaker 1: Next.
Speaker 2: This picture is probably 1967 and that's my sister, Susan, my mother, myself and my son, Kevin.
