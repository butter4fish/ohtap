Speaker 1: Today's date, July 11, 2000. My name is Barbara Boyd, B-O-Y-D. Indianapolis, Indiana. 3601 [North] Gilford [Avenue].  Interview is being conducted in my home. Which is nice to have Julieanna [Richardson, interviewer] here.
Speaker 2: And it's nice to be here. And thank you. No, it's been nice. Okay.
Story_ID: 3743
Speaker 1: I start off by asking people just five questions. They don't really have any relationship, actually. You probably saw them there, but--.  I'd like to know what your favorite food is?
Speaker 2: I put this on the list. My favorite food: steak, potatoes and salad with honey mustard dressing and caramel cake (laughs).
Speaker 1: Your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: My favorite time of year is summertime because, you know, have you ever seen people that go to Alaska?  Have you ever seen any pictures of people that go to Alaska?  What do you see?  They all have on jackets.  It's cold.  I don't like cold weather, so I like summertime and I like to go on vacation where it's warm.  For instance, we went to Greece, the weather was perfect.  We went to Trinidad, the weather was perfect.  So, I like warm weather climates.  And in the summer we like to go to our summer home in Angola, Indiana, so--.  We're not beach people, but we hang around there once in a while.
Speaker 1: Okay, your favorite color?
Speaker 2: All colors!  Except navy blue.  Navy blue just doesn't do anything for me, but if you look in my closet you will see an array of all colors from--. I like bright colors.  I'm a winter, so I like the purples and I like greens and certain shades of yellow.  Now light blue I can wear.  Red, black, all colors, except navy blue.
Speaker 1: And your favorite vacation--. Did I ask favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I told you.
Speaker 1: Yes, you did. Okay.
Speaker 2: And favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 1: Well, I've adopted a phrase that my husband [Theodore 'Ted' Boyd] sort of has adopted and that's: do what you got to do.  You know, when it really gets down to making a decision or whatever, you got to do what you got to do.  So that's sort of a thing with both of us.
Story_ID: 3744
Speaker 1: I want to start out by asking, you know, where you were--. About your childhood and your mother and father. And, so--. Or grandparents.  But, I'd like to talk about growing up, now where were you born?
Speaker 2: I was born in Evanston, Illinois.  My parents, Ernest and Alberta Andry, and--loving parents they are--were.  Well my mom still lives.  But I'm an only child: unspoiled, if you please.  And I think I was very fortunate in that I knew all of my grandparents, my father's parents [Grandfather Andry and grandmother, Bell Foster] and my mom's parents [grandfather, Lee Rogers and grandmother, Celeste Dunn].  And I think it was always really delightful for me when my grandparents would come up from South Carolina to visit during the summer.  It was just always extra special for me to be with my grandparents.  And I remember with my grandmother, whose name is Celeste, how she would always write to us and say--even then she was an activist--and would say, you know, "We're getting ready to go out and try to get the vote, you know, trying to get the vote out, trying to get the Negroes to vote."  And, I always enjoyed reading her letters and then she came. And then with my dad's grandmother [dad's mother], Ma Bell. Ma Bell.  We'd go down to Mount Vernon, Alabama and of course I'd never been on a farm or any place rural.  And it was fun for me to see a chicken being killed.  She'd go out and get a chicken for dinner, pop his head, you know, and throw it down a little funnel kind of thing (imitates killing a chicken).  Honey, and one thing I noticed down there, we ate all day everyday.  You get up in the morning, you got pork chops and grits and whatever and as soon as that was over, she was fixing something else for lunch or whatever they call dinner, lunch-dinner, and then something for dinner.  It was just always a delight being around there. Now my dad, Ernest Andry, had a truck or a transfer moving, had a moving company.  And the first vehicle I learned how to drive was a truck.  He taught me how to drive a truck and I used to go out on the truck with him, you know.  And he delivered--. After he got out of the trucking business, he was in the paper box business--company business. And he would deliver paper boxes to, you know, department stores and I'd always go out with him on that.  So he taught me how to drive a truck, then he taught me how to drive a car.  And it was just a joy to go out with my dad on the truck and when he'd let me drive, wow, that was it. Now, Mom was a quiet, sweet, strong person.  Housewife, and just always there.  Always, you know, of course you took tap dancing lessons and piano lessons, but my parents were always there, always encouraged me, you can do it if you try.  Now my dad always told me that "You can do anything, you know, if you're ready.  You can go anywhere and do anything if you're ready."  But I found out that's not exactly true.  You can't always--you can be ready, but you can't always make it.  And I found that out after I had our first child, Karen [Beamon (maiden name, Boyd)].
Story_ID: 3745
Speaker 1: I had worked in Chicago [Illinois] and I was home for a couple of years after she [daughter, Karen Beamon (maiden name, Boyd)] was born and I went out for an interview at a hospital.  And the lady said, "Well Mrs. Boyd, with your background you're just perfect for this job."  It was in personnel in the hospital.  She said, "But I don't have the right to, you know, to hire so, you know, I'm going to leave your application here and Ms. So and So is going to look at it."  So then she called me back later on and she said--. She called back, she said--. No, I went for the interview and she said, "Well, Mrs. Boyd, I'm sorry," she called back and she said--the lady called back she said, "I'm sorry, you didn't get the job."  And I said, "Oh, okay."  And I got to thinking, wonder why I didn't get that job, she said I was so perfect.  So I called her back.  And I said, "Well, was there some reason, you know, I didn't get the job?"  There was this long pause.  Now this wasn't the lady that interviewed me, this was the secretary.  And she said, "The only reason you didn't get the job is because you're colored."  Honey, I cried.  Ted [husband, Theodore Boyd] came home and, you know, I was crying. He said, "What's the matter with you?"  "I didn't get that job cause I'm colored (imitates sobbing)."  You know!  I was just devastated, I mean, it had never been that blatant with me before and I'm twenty something years old. I mean it had been subtle before, you know, in high school we couldn't join the riding club, because where they rode in Skokie, Illinois, it didn't permit blacks.  My girlfriend would try out for--tried out for 'H.M.S. Pinafore' for the musical and she was told that, "Well what would it look like if we had a white person playing Carmen, Carmen--." You know, it was like that.  But this was so blatant to say that you're not being hired because you're colored. And I tell you, from that point on dear, I never went to apply for a job again, uh-uh, I really didn't.  Any job I got thereafter, somebody wanted me.  I tell you, yes, there was one other job I went to apply after that, when we moved to Indianapolis [Indiana].  And I tell you, I sat out in my car I bet you fifteen minutes, trying to make up my mind whether I wanted to go in and be rejected.  And I said to myself, "Now here I am, a college-trained person having this kind of feeling, what must it be like for men and women who don't have any kind of background and everyday are being rejected?"  You know, you see guys hanging on the corner, you know, you're very quick to say, "Why don't they go somewhere and get a job?" You know, and from what I experienced I know that it's not--it can't be that easy for them.  And so after that, somebody came to me. You know, I got the job at Channel 6 [WRTV Indianapolis] accidentally.  I worked for Head Start [Head Start Bureau, education preparation non-profit organization], I was working for another organization when I got that job and he transferred over.  And Ted was at a luncheon one day and the guy happened to lean over to him and said, "Do you happen to know a woman that can be my secretary?"  And he said, "Yeah, my wife."  So, I've just been very fortunate.
Story_ID: 3746
Speaker 1: Let me ask this, I want to go back--. I thought it was good--. I want to go back to Evanston [Illinois] and understand a little bit more about your parents--.  I'd like to--. Or even growing up at that time, you know, in Evanston.  Because Evanston is not Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: And there's always been from a long time ago a black community there, but I wanted to know how your parents [Ernest and Alberta Andry] actually ended up coming from the various places to Evanston.
Speaker 2: I don't really know.  I know that my mother lived there, even though she was born in Augusta, Georgia, they came there--I don't know.  I know that my dad initially worked for a cleaners and it wasn't like we moved from somewhere else there I mean, I was born there.  So I don't really know how or why they got to Evanston.
Speaker 1: Do you know how they met?
Speaker 2: I-- (laughs). I think a girlfriend of my mom's said, you know, "There's a cute guy I want you to meet." And I think it was like a double-date thing and that's how they met.  My mother said she was smitten right away, right off.  And I think Dad tried to play hard to get.  But (snaps fingers and laughs) he was got.
Speaker 1: He was smitten also.
Speaker 2: He was smitten also.
Speaker 1: Now, what was it like growing up as an only child?
Speaker 2: Fun and sometimes lonesome--lonely.  As an only child you have to be a little creative, you have to sort of make your own fun.  But my mom always saw to it that I was busy enough.  I took piano lessons, I took tap dancing lessons and she always took me places, you know, to the library or wherever.  And I had cousins.  I was the only girl, but I had boy cousins.  My mother's sister had three boys and they lived in Evanston and of course, I always wanted to be with them.  So I sort of was a little tomboy.  If they ate candy,  I wanted to eat candy and I couldn't and I'd always be the one to get the stomach ache.  If they ran, I ran and of course I'd be the one that would always fall, but I'd blame them because I fell and then they'd get a whipping because they didn't take care of me. But, growing up in Evanston was great and I'll tell you, you know, it has just been, just sort of noticed this since I've been going back to Evanston to visit my mother, I rarely or we rarely went outside the black community.  I've gone back to Evanston and seen places I've never been before, you know.  I just never had any reason to go.  For instance, if we went up north, we went up north to Dyche Stadium [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] to the fireworks or we went up there just to the movies.  But to go up there for anything else, there wasn't any reason to go there.  I went to south Evanston and there weren't that many blacks living in south Evanston.  My aunt lived down there and I'd go down there to visit them. And I'd ride around and of course blacks live everywhere in Evanston now and we go back and we visit them and, you know. "Oh, I've never been to this area before.  Pretty nice." You know, it's just sort of amazing.
Speaker 1: What was the area? What was the black area?
Speaker 2: We were mainly on the west side.
Speaker 1: What were the circum--I mean, the streets?
Speaker 2: Emerson [Street], Dodge [Avenue], Darrow [Avenue], Church [Street], those were the main streets. Dewey [Avenue], Jackson [Avenue].
Speaker 1: And what--. You say that--. This is--. I--. You--. I want to go back to just a moment, childhood. I want to go back to Evanston. But, you said that it was kind of lonely. What--. You were--. Were there a lot of kids on the block, or was it, you know, sometimes only kids feel that they have to you know, be satisfied--.
Speaker 2: No, there were not a lot of children on the block.  And where we eventually moved on Oak [Street, Evanston, Illinois], I don't really recall any other children that lived on that block.  There wasn't really anybody to play with, you know. But it wasn't bad because I was occupied enough with other things.
Speaker 1: Do you remember your addresses?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I lived at 1041 Emerson Street and 1732 Oak [Street].
Story_ID: 3747
Speaker 1: And what was the young Barbara Boyd, what type of child was she? I mean, we know--.  You know, you talked about playing with your cousins, but what kind of child was she? Was she a dreamer? Was she precocious?
Speaker 2: I was precocious.  I was a dreamer. And I always dreamed about being in the movies.  I went to the movies every Saturday.  That was my thing.  After my chores were finished I would go to the movie.  And I remember this one movie--. What was it? Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald, I've forgotten what it was. And I was on my way.  And  honey, the fare had gone up, to a dime.  I don't think I had but seven cents or something and I was crushed because that's all I had, you know (laughs)!  So I didn't go back home to get more money, but every Saturday I went to the movies.  Bette Davis was my absolute favorite movie star.  And of course I--. We were talking the other night and I said, "I bet you, today, you couldn't name all five or six great, you know, movie stars like Bette Davis, Joan Crawford, Greer Garson, Ann Sheridan, Barbara Stanwyck, you know. Just--Olivia de Havilland, Joan Fontaine, Shirley Temple,  you know. That you would really remember today."  To me, those women are still great. I lived with them every Saturday. The John Garfields, the--you know. I just fantasized about being a movie star. And every opportunity I got--. We lived about a half a block from the post office and I'd go down there and I'd tap dance at night. And I had one of those poodle skirts, I never shall forget it.  It was turquoise and it had a little poodle on it and I'd go down had my little tap dancing shoes because I took tap dancing lessons, you know.  And I'd go down there and I'd do my little number and I'd twirl around and my skirt would go all out and the guys in the back, that worked in the back of the post office began to know who I was.  And they'd say , "Here comes Barbara again, hey we can hear her out there tapping up!"  Oh, I'd imagine I was Ginger Rogers and I'd-- (makes tapping noise). It was great (laughts)! To me--.
Speaker 1: That's cute. That's cute.
Speaker 2: Fantasizing.
Speaker 1: Well you know, its good to have a good imagination. I used to think I was going to be discovered too. It was cute. The limousine would drive up. But anyway--. So I can identify.
Story_ID: 3748
Speaker 1: Who would you say you're most like, your mother [Alberta Andry] or your father [Ernest Andry]?
Speaker 2: My father. He was aggressive. But I think I get my soft, compassionate side from my mom, my patience.  Well, I'm not too--not as patient as she is.  But my dad always said, "If there's a dollar to be made, Andry could make one of them."  Or he'd say to me, "Don't forget,  Andrys are superior to the world."  Well that's taking it a little far, but that's the kind, you know, you know, "Don't ever let anybody get over on you, you know.  Always be one up. Study harder than anybody else cause you're black."  Well, it wasn't "black" then, it was "colored."  "You have to try harder than anybody," you know.  And so--. That's the kind of thing that--. You know, thoughts that I grew up with, you know.
Speaker 1: Now he was entrepreneurial, it sounds like, he had his own business.  He didn't really work---did he work for anyone during the time?
Speaker 2: He did work for a cleaners.  He worked for a cleaners and he lost his eye.  I don't know exactly how the accident--. Something flew in his eye and he lost his eye.  And--then he started his own business and had his own business until he retired and went back to Mount Vernon, Alabama.  But, he never wanted to work for anyone else and he always said, you know, "Try to have your own, you never get anywhere working for anybody else."  That was his attitude.
Speaker 1: So now what were the-- you said he had a trucking and a--.
Speaker 2: He had a moving company.
Speaker 1: Moving company, okay.
Speaker 2: They call it--call it a transfer company, Andry Transfer Country [sic, Company].  And then after he stopped that he went into, he used his trucks for transporting paper boxes to department stores.
Speaker 1: So did you ever work in the business when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: No, uh-uh.
Speaker 1: Did your mother ever help him out?
Speaker 2: Not other than taking orders, you know, on the phone, but not on the truck.  I don't think women would of even thought about driving with--.
Speaker 1: No, just even helping? Just helping?
Speaker 2: Taking orders and, you know, stuff like that, on the phone, you know, somebody would call and wanted to be moved.  That kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Do you think you were very much a daddy's girl?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.  I was a tomboy too, yeah.  I hung on my dad, you know.  Absolutely a daddy's girl.
Story_ID: 3749
Speaker 1: Now what memories do you have of school?
Speaker 2: Good.  Fun. Hard in math, hard in math (laughs). But, now, where we lived, I would have had to have gone to Foster School, elementary school [Evanston, Illinois], which was all black.  But my daddy didn't want me to go there.  You see, we lived on this side of Emerson Street.  If you lived on that side, which was white, you could go to Dewey School [Dewey Elementary School].  So, this is when Aunt Minnie came into play, who lived down in south Evanston. So I went to Central School [Central Elementary School, Evanston, Illinois].  Talk about busing--I wasn't bused, but I caught a bus everyday to go to Central School, which was mixed.  There were very few black children that lived in south Evanston, but, you know, my cousins and--my cousins and myself, maybe about a handful of black kids. And then went to Evanston Township [Evanston Township High School] and even though, you know, there was some prejudices there, I did manage to--I was in the drama club and G.A.A. [Girls' Athletic Association], you know, cheering (imitates cheerleading). And--very active in those activities in school.  And I have to thank an English teacher of mine, Helen Huvdy.  We had a talent show and I used to do impressions of movie stars. I'd do Katharine Hepburn and Henry Aldrich and Homer and I've forgotten who the others are.  But at any rate, I represented my school in the talent show, 'Rubin's Stars of Tomorrow,' on WGN [720 AM, radio station]  in Chicago [Illinois] (imitates an announcer's voice).  And--came in second.  You know who I lost to?  A little girl that was about three years old who named all the presidents and sang the 'Star-Spangled Banner.'  I think at that time there were only about twelve presidents in the world (laughs).  But elementary school was fun for me and had a lot of good friends and high school was too.  Wasn't good in math though, just couldn't make that math.  But, got out. So yeah, school was fun.
Story_ID: 3750
Speaker 1: I want to get some sort of context, you know, especially at the time that, you know, you've entered puberty or past that time, of what the social circumstances were there, you know, because I always--that whole--Evanston [Illinois] is the beginning of that whole sort of North Shore group, it was a little--. You know, it was a little different and so I'm just wondering, it was a different type of black person I think that gravitated to Evanston, that wasn't located on the South Side of Chicago.  Not always but--.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, we always got the reputation of being, you know (makes superior gesture), sort of better than--"Oh, you're from Evanston," you know, that kind of--.  And you rather enjoy that kind of thing. I don't know whether we were or not but you know, I was a child that never wanted for anything.  Matter of fact, my mother--I was questioning one time, not really questioning but--how I could come to school so clean every day?  How does that happen? Please. You know, but--it's just, I think, as an Evanstonian, you had a certain sense of pride about who you were and where you came from and you sort of conducted yourself that way, you know (exaggerates poise).  We were a tight-knit family.  And because many of the families there--maybe parents or mothers--worked in service, they knew how to do the finer things of life. They knew how to set a good table, they knew all the mannerisms that you should have, that young ladies and young men should have. And, you know, how to, you know, carry--conduct yourselves the way society says that you should. And I think there was a lot of that there.
Story_ID: 3751
Speaker 1: And so when you were coming of age, what were, I mean, what were the social circumstances?  Were there plenty of eligible young men or--was that? It's probably not like today?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't have any problems dating, you know, there were just certain guys you would date, you know.  Some were off limits. But the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] was the social spot.  I remember going to the Y [YMCA] dressed up on Friday evenings. Even wearing a little tam or something, or maybe even wearing gloves.  When we went out in those days, you wore gloves.  And you know, you were just dressed.  Had to be home by eleven and there was no question about that.  We're talking about curfew here and how it's no longer in effect.  Your parents said to be home by eleven, the young man had you home by eleven.  But the YMCA was the big social center. And then there were a lot of private parties, you know,  that we had in homes.  You know, the parents would always be there, would always have food, not just chip and dip, food!  You know, maybe spaghetti, or whatever. And you had certain friends that you invited and that's what you did.  Of course there were always those that crashed, you know, those that weren't invited would always, you know. There's always that circumstance. And I had to say there wasn't a lot of drinking.  There were a few fast girls that, you know, that might take a drink.  But you know what it was?  It was wine. And a few guys that would drink wine and beer, you know.  I remember we had, at that time I was an Episcopalian and every Christmas Eve we'd have a social at the church and then we'd go out on a sleigh ride.  And the kids from Lake Forest [Illinois] would come down--Lake Forest and Glencoe [Illinois]--(laughs) and they would lace the tea.  They'd bring the bottle, we'd have hot tea, you know, with a cinnamon stick and they'd lace the tea.  Well of course we'd always go to service before we went out on the sleigh ride and one of the boys had a bottle of beer and he brought it to church and it dropped and it went, clunk, clunk, clunk--down the aisle. And everybody (laughs)--it was a stitch--but we had a lot of interaction with kids from Lake Forest and Glencoe who would come down.  Of course there weren't many black kids that lived up there, just several families and they'd come down and we'd have things together. And that was the sort of the social structure.
Speaker 1: Now were you part of Jack and Jill [of America, Inc.] and things like that or were your parents part of any of those?
Speaker 2: No they weren't, but I was a Jack and Jill parent.  My kids were in Jack and Jill.
Speaker 1: Then, let me--let me--. Are there any other memories that you would like to share with us about that time period, from-- you know, up to graduating? Are there any other--?
Speaker 2: Well I, I just remember--you know how you hear a lot of kids talk about, "I had to do this and I had to do that and my life was--" you know. I had a good childhood.  You know, my parents were neat.  I mean, I don't think they were ever overly unreasonable about things that they asked. I had nice friends, good friends, you know. Socially good, you know, I'd go to Chicago [Illinois]. I was in the Ivyettes [girls club related to Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.] and some other club in Chicago group that I'd go down to then, you know. But, I didn't have any complaints, I really didn't.  My parents were always very supportive in anything that I did, anything.
Story_ID: 3752
Speaker 1: Anything else that you found humorous or that--sort of touching, or anything that you experienced during that time, or--?  Anything more about your trips down South? Or maybe--.
Speaker 2: I remember driving down South with my dad, I think this was the first visit.  And you know all the terrible things you hear about, you know, the South with what they do to black people.  And--we were going through this little town and we were at a stop light or stop sign, I don't remember which, and all--this bunch of white guys were standing on the corner and so, one of them says (imitates southern twang), "Hey Miss!" I said, "Oh god."  "Hey Miss!" I said, "Yes?"  He said "You got a twig caught up under you car; maybe you better tell your daddy to get it out, before it cause any damage to the car."  "Thank you, thank you"  (laughing). But I mean my heart was just (makes thumping, thumping noise).  I said, "Oh God, they was getting ready to lynch us," cause that's the kind of stuff you heard, you know.  And then I was just so surprised at how my southern cousins lived, very well.  I mean you just have a picture of rural South.  I mean they had horses, they lived well, they had indoor plumbing, you know, had a lovely home.  It was just really nice.  You know, better than what we probably had living up North, you know.  And I was just pleasantly surprised about that, you know. And how they lived and how well they treated ol' city cousin, you know, who wasn't used to horses. I love the country though. I love--see I like gardening and stuff like that. I like working outside, so--.
Story_ID: 3753
Speaker 1: So now I was asking you about if you got into Chicago [Illinois] at all much.
Speaker 2: Well in this club, in this--I don't know if it was Ivyettes [girls club, related to Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.], or whether there was another club. Did you know--well, I know you know Lorraine Hansberry.  Lorraine Hansberry and her cousin, Shauneille Perry, and all of us were in a club together.  And I'd go down for that, you know.  When it was my turn, they'd come out to Evanston [Illinois].  But other than that and then, oh, I remember as a child, we'd always go downtown to the big movie, to the big theater.  What is that big theater on State Street [Chicago]?  There were floor shows, I mean, big shows.
Speaker 1: The Chicago Theatre?
Speaker 2: The Chicago Theatre.  There were big stage shows, you know, big productions.  And we'd go down there at least once a month, you know.  And another thing I always enjoyed as a child, every Sunday after dinner, and dinner always usually consisted of lamb or roast beef, rice and gravy, peas, sweet potatoes and three-layer jello for dessert.  And then after that, we'd go out for a ride, you know.  Just go out for a ride.  And I remember, we were all ready to go and some friends came by and they got to talking and I sat and waited, and waited, and waited, and they never left and we never got a chance to go on that ride.  'Cause you just sort of look forward to that, you know.  If was just sort of like a family thing that we did every Sunday, just go riding out into the--wherever, you know.  Or and then go downtown to the movies, that was a big thing to go downtown to the Chicago Theatre and see those stages shows.  It was something, I mean, they were quite the production.  And I think that's something that has sort of piqued my interest in being in theater, being in the movies or being whatever I thought I wanted to be.
Story_ID: 3754
Speaker 1: You were in a club with Lorraine Hansberry [playwright] and so I would just like--. What was she like?
Speaker 2: She was a cool chick.  Well, that was before she had written the book [sic, play, 'A Raisin in the Sun,' 1959].  We were at her house for a meeting and they were sort of--really sort of well off.  Her parents owned apartment buildings--a lot of apartments buildings and I recall how she said something about, "Go in the bedroom, it's in the bedroom" or whatever I was asking for or whatever she wanted to have and get.  And I recall going in the bedroom and there was all this money sitting on the dresser, I mean just stacks of money, just sitting there, you know, waiting to be spent or whatever (laughs).  But, Lorraine was cool.  And her cousin Shauneille [Perry] was also in the theater.  And I think he's done some work with Shubert, if I remember correctly? It was the Shubert Theatre in Chicago.  And has done quite a bit in New York.  Then I remember later on after she had written her book, we were downtown on Cottage Grove [Avenue] or some club on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] and went in and she was sitting in a booth there and we hadn't seen each other for quite a while.  And I went and I said, "Lorraine! Hi!  I haven't seen you--" "Oh, hi Barbara" (impersonates snooty voice).  Hello! "Hi, how are you doing"  "Oh fine."  Well, hello.  So that's the way that went.
Speaker 1: Why don't you hear anything about the Hansberry family, it's like they--why--what happened to them?  Are there any descendants or anything?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I think she had a sister.  I think she had a brother named Carl, I don't--.
Speaker 1: You don't hear anything about them. Just that she died at an early age--.
Speaker 2: I don't have any--as a matter of fact, Shauneille and I were closer than Lorraine.  We just went to each other's homes for meetings but, once in a while we'd all go out to a show or something like that but, I wasn't as close to her as I was to her cousin. And I just spoke with Shauneille maybe about a couple of years ago--two or three years ago--and I don't know what happened to them because they used to be quite the name.  I mean they owned a lot of property in Chicago apartment buildings.

Speaker 1: And so what were your role models back then?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, this is an old cliche kind of thing, but I got to say my mom [Alberta Andry] and dad [Ernest Andry], I really do.  I mean, as I mentioned before, they just encouraged me to do anything I thought I wanted to do and backed me up all the way.  I mean they exposed me to things, you know, by taking me to different shows, to the theater, the library.  Encouraging me that, you know, "You can do it if you try."  And that's just sort of been my--I'm a little pushy broad. Little bit. I'm a little aggressive sometimes. And I think I got it from them.  I don't think that's too bad.
Story_ID: 3756
Speaker 1: Now okay, it's--you know, it's your senior year, you're getting ready to graduate, what are your thoughts at that point?  Or what do you end up doing? What are you thoughts and what do you end up doing?
Speaker 2: Well, going to college, you know.  How exciting is that going to be?  I remember, well of course, the senior prom.  Didn't go to the senior prom, went to the junior prom.  Didn't go to the senior prom, didn't get asked.  Went to the junior prom, didn't go to the senior prom (laughs). But I think--I think there were four of us, I know that a lot of girls didn't get asked, but there were four of us that ran around together and we went to Chicago [Illinois] to see 'Red Shoes.'  We went to see the theater production of 'Red Shoes,' I remember that.  "Well, they'll have their prom, we're going to see 'Red Shoes.'"  So that's what we did.  But--went to the University of Illinois, Champaign [Champaign, Illinois], had lots of fun.
Story_ID: 3757
Speaker 1: So how was that experience, because here you've been sort of more in a cloistered environment and downstate's [southern Illinois] a little --
Speaker 2: Didn't have any problems.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know what, I think, I think, and often times--I don't know if maybe I'm not very bright, but I think a lot of times you just sort of look for it.  I just sort of go along, you know, it really has to be blatant with me.  And, you know, I just sort of give you the benefit of the doubt until you do something to prove otherwise.  You know, you can hear about what people say certain kind of places are.  I remember that--when I first did a story going to southern Indiana, oh, "You're going to have--they're not gonna--." I never had one problem, I really never did. And I do recall in high school, we had just been to a game or something and after the game we had this one guy, we had a white kid, a lot of my friends were white.  And we ran--and got into the car, we were gonna pile up in the car and go somewhere.  So the guy that owned the car, you know, looked and kind of says, "You're not going."  And I said, "Oh yeah, I'm going."  He says, "No."  I says, "Sure I'm going." Duh--he says, "Not in this car you're not."  I said, "Oh, okay."  And the other kids didn't go either. And also, while in high school, there were certain places we couldn't go, like Cooley's Cupboard [restaurant, Evanston, Illinois]. So I went back to my fiftieth high school reunion, we had a little--little quiz and you got a little t-shirt if you had the right question.  You know, who was the favorite football star, who was so and so and what was the favorite place to go and what was the favorite drink and eat.  (Raises hand) "Cherry Coke and curly fries at Cooley's Cupboard." So I happened to be in on the program that evening, a little pantomime thing, so I said, "You know, I think I should get a T-shirt just on account, on account I couldn't answer one of those questions.  Cause I couldn't go to Cooley's Cupboard so I wouldn't have known about curly fries and Cherry Coke."  Quiet-quiet over the room. After, "Oh Barb, gee kid, I just never realized."  Give me a break, you know.  Just you know, blinders and they never think.  You know, you're there and they never think about you're not there when you know, everybody else is.  And those are some of the things that I remember, but hey, you get over.  Cause you know, your parents tell you what might happen.  But I tell you, when that job situation happened to me it just, cause it hadn't-- it wasn't anything that I couldn't just deal with.  But that, you can't, we're not hiring you because you're colored, just really broke me up. But--.
Speaker 1: So it was rejection.
Speaker 2: Yes!  It's rejection, just out and out rejection.
Speaker 1: For no reason.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Story_ID: 3758
Speaker 1: Now what was your major in college [The University of Illinois, Champaign]?
Speaker 2: Speech.
Speaker 1: Speech, and what did you decide--?  Had you been doing speech--? I  mean you had been acting, what made you decide you wanted to do speech?
Speaker 2: Well, it seems to me that that was the next best thing to drama, or whatever.  And I don't know whether that was the best thing for me to take at the time, I mean that's what I think the counselor said to do, you know, and it would lead to drama or whatever. But I didn't have a problem with it and, you know, I always did recitations at church and you know how little kids are always in the Easter program and they have a little something to say.  I was in different skits at school, pardon me, so, you know,  I didn't have a problem with being in front of a crowd and I didn't have--I wasn't nervous in delivering a speech or being emcee for this, or being in a fashion show or whatever.  'Cause I think, you know,  I think in order to even be in television or to be in this kind of business, you have to have a sense of ham, you got to have some ham. And I have that.
Speaker 1: So now, how many blacks were in your class?
Speaker 2: Oh I'd say, twelve, fifteen, maybe twenty.
Speaker 1: Mainly from Illinois or around?
Speaker 2: Are you talking about high school or--?
Speaker 1: I'm talking about U of I [The University of Illinois, Champaign].
Speaker 2: Oh, not a lot.  I don't know. I don't know.  I just, I don't know.
Speaker 1: But you liked it, what did you like about it so much?  Was it because it was college and you were free from your parents and--?
Speaker 2: It was college, it was a different challenge and, you know, meeting people of diverse backgrounds.  I remember, I think it was the first Jewish girl I'd ever met.  It seems to me like every Jewish girl I ever met had a pinky ring.  And I thought that was something indicative of, you know,  Jewish--, all Jewish people have little pinky rings, you know (laughs).  And just meeting people from different backgrounds.  Living in a house with different girls, you know, and sharing a bathroom and sharing clothes--which I didn't like too well, but--.  And, you know, the guys from the fraternity coming over and singing songs and just, it was just great.  I just really enjoyed it, you know. I liked the social aspect of it and I think it caused me to really buckle down.  You know, I'm an only child, everything was usually sort of done for me.  But here was a chance that--I think my parents did a pretty good job of building a foundation and I was able to handle myself pretty well, you know, going off to school. Going off to camp is sort of a prerequisite to going off to school in that you're away for a couple of weeks and you're on your own and you deal with other kinds of people and I went to camp every summer.  And you know, in my day, you didn't just go to summer school cause you had to, you could go to summer school to pick up extra credits.  I went to summer school every summer.  I mean that was just a given: "You're going to go to summer school and after summer school you go to camp."  So I think that was sort of a prerequisite for preparing you to be able to handle yourself when you got on a campus.
Story_ID: 3759
Speaker 1: So you finish, you're, you know, in your senior in year of college and then what are your thoughts at that point?
Speaker 2: I'm going to get this big job in the movies. But of course it doesn't happen.  And I came out, I got a job at People's Gas, Light and Coke Company on Michigan [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois].  I worked in personnel, used the tools of the trade I had taken as an elective in high school.  And I worked as a secretary there, moved here to Indianapolis [Indiana] and worked as a secretary here.
Speaker 1: Well, how did you move to Indianapolis?
Speaker 2: Okay, wait a minute, I got married.  I'm getting ahead of myself.  Okay, worked as a secretary in Evanston [Illinois].  I worked at People's Gas, Light and Coke Company, that's right.  After I didn't get the job at Evanston Hospital because I was "colored."  Friend, no, I'm getting ahead of myself because when I worked at People's Gas, Light and Coke Company I wasn't married yet. I wasn't married yet. Got a good job at People's Gas, Light, and Coke Company.  Then I met Ted [husband, Theodore Boyd].  And my cousin Gwennie, was going with a guy who had lived in Indianapolis.  And when Ted came here then they introduced me to Ted, he was the Executive Director--well he wasn't the Executive then, he became his Boys' Work Secretary.  I had been in an organization at the Y [YMCA, Young Men's Christian Association] called Ten-bads, we played tennis in the summer and badminton in the winter.  So I had been over to the Y and watching Ted practice his basketball moves.  The circle eight, cute.  And so, I said to my cousin, "He's cute."  So she says, "Well, I'll fix it up so we have a double date.  I'll tell Charles."  So sure enough we have this double date and he came over (buries face in her hands).  He had on a green jacket, brown pants (laughs), white socks and black shoes.  Oh, it was a disaster!  I said to my cousin, "Are we going out!  Dressed like that!"  So we went to Michelini's for dinner.  Good thing it was subdued lighting, right? And so, after that I met him at the Y again, I said, "Oh, do you play badminton?"  He said, "Oh, I play a little bit."  So we got to playing cause I think I'm pretty good, see I'm president of the group.  You know, I'm pretty good at this badminton, right.  So I'm sitting there waiting for the birdie to come across--(whistles in imitation of the birdie whizzing by) I never hit the birdie!  Come to find out he's some kind of badminton champion of the state.  So after that we had to use other tactics.  But he was just great, he never let me hit that birdie.
Speaker 1: So now wait a minute, so was he a country boy--you had to get him--was he country, in some respects?
Speaker 2: Not country but very naive about a lot of things, very, you know, Ted's the kind of guy and still is, just sees the good in everybody.  No matter how lousy they are, there's always a good side.  He always sees the positive side to things.  I think that's what I love about him most, he's just, he's a generous man, he's a gentle man.  He's a positive-thinking man.  You know, when things go wrong, I can always look to him to show me the brighter side of life.  And--I think that's what attracted me about him.  He's kind--and you will never, never see him display anger.  He will get very quiet and you know, but you won't see any outbursts, not ever.
Speaker 1: So you met--you got together and you married. Did you move back to Indianapolis at that point?
Speaker 2: We lived in Evanston [Illinois] for a while. And--.
Speaker 1: Now what did your parents think of him?  You know, you're the only child. I mean that's--.
Speaker 2: Oh, my mother [Alberta Andry] loved him.  But my dad [Ernest Andry]--I had to eventually say, "Hey, do you want your name of the invitation?"  And I don't think it was Ted, it would have been any guy.  "My baby, and I just don't know if you can support her in the manner in which she's been"--what was that, you know?  It wasn't like we were the richest people on the North Shore [collective suburbs north of Chicago, Illinois] or anything.  But no, he, you know, he was very hesitant and I finally had to call and say, "Do you want your name on the invitation? Let me know cause it's got to be in by so and so date and if not, hey, cause it's going to happen."  So he finally came through, he came to the wedding.  And honey, after it was over, he just loved Ted.  They just got to be the best of friends.
Story_ID: 3760
Speaker 1: And then after when we were in Evanston [Illinois], let's see, we moved to, I'll tell you it was just an honor for Ted [husband, Theodore Boyd] to go back--to come back here to Indianapolis [Indiana].  His Boys' Work Secretary was R. K. Smith back here in Indianapolis and he worked here under Mr. Smith here.  And--Mr. Smith called and said, you know, "I'm retiring, I wish you'd come back here and take my spot."  And so he left Evanston as Executive Director of the Y [YMCA, Young Men's Christian Association] and went and came back here to Indianapolis to work.  And I worked on the desk for about a few months cause he asked me to come in and work and then like I said, he had been at a luncheon with a guy and he said, do you know anybody I can get for a secretary so he said, "Yeah, my wife".  So that was with the National Conference of Christians and Jews.  Then I worked for ADL, Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, then I worked for JWF, Jewish Welfare Federation.  Then I worked for JCRC, Jewish Community Relations Council.  And from there, the Director of JCRC became the Executive Director of Head Start [Head Start Bureau, education preparation nonprofit organization] in 1965, July 10th.  And so we were the first to employ, I helped open a Head Start program here in 1965, and stayed there as, what do they call them now--? They don't call them secretaries any more, they call them--.
Speaker 2: Administrative Assistant?
Speaker 1: Administrative Assistant.
Story_ID: 3761
Speaker 1: And--got a phone call. No, what happened, Channel 6 [WRTV, Indianapolis, Indiana] was doing a documentary on Indianapolis.  And within the documentary they included a Head Start [Head Start Bureau, education preparation non-profit organization] classroom.  And so I guess when the big boys decided they wanted some African American or an African American female on TV, they called Head Start office, the woman in the classroom where they had filmed. I got the phone call and before we put any calls through to the classroom, you sort of, you know, screen it, you know:  "What's the nature of this call?"  Well, we wanted her to audition for television.  So I very jokingly said, "Well if you're looking for a star!  Here I are!"  So the guy said, "Are you joking, would you really like to do that?"  I said, "Yeah, what do I got to do?"  Cause I thought all you had to do on television was to read, you know.  So he said, "Well, why don't you just work up a little five or six minute vignette on anything you'd like."  I said "Well okay."  Well, they sent out a crew--well, the woman that they wanted, I think there were eight of us that tried out, women, black women around the city tried out.  So they sent a crew out and I was Head Start's office manager and I worked up a little thing about the office and the role that each one of the women played.  Didn't know it, but I did a little stand up, hey--not just a stand up, a walking stand up.  Did a little walking stand up. Stopped at the desks and explained you know, how "We're the big cog and the little cog," oh, you know, just rapping on, 'cause I don't  really  think I'm going to get this job.  And then I had to go down to the studio to do a news read.  So Ted [husband, Theodore Boyd] and I are driving by the station one day and I said, "I'll probably be working there one day," just joking.  He said, "Yeah, right."  I said, "You just wait and see."  Well sure enough, on February the 9th, no, February 10th, 1969, I got the call to come to work.
Story_ID: 3762
Speaker 1: I went in for the interview [at Channel 6, WRTV, Indianapolis, Indiana] and there were seven white men sitting in the room.  And I said, "You got to know that I don't really care whether I get this job or not see, cause I'm making big money at Head Start [Head Start Bureau, education preparation non-profit organization].  I'm making nine thousand dollars a year, you got to know."  So they're asking questions and I'm being very flip.  "Oh yeah--." "You think you--" "Oh yeah!" (imitates extreme confidence). So when we get ready to come out,  I bump next to another guy who happens to be the news director at the station.  And I had always seen him doing editorials and I always noticed that he was bald and why didn't they ever powder his head because it would always shine.  And so when I looked up at him and I said, "Oh, you do have hair."  This guy ends up being my boss, and he's very sensitive about his head.  That was my intro to my new boss.  We got on very well. We got on very well. And I think the first two weeks that I was at Channel 6, I read books this thick from the FCC [Federal Communications Commission], I couldn't tell you what one word was.  Then I worked in programming there for a month or so and then I worked in news.  And then they asked me "Which department would you like to be?"  Well I said news because I couldn't see anything that I could do in programming.  What I wanted to do in programming, the main guy was doing, Jim Drudd.  I would have wanted to be in--to do what he did, so I said news.  Didn't know beans about it, but there were just a lot of very helpful people there that helped me all the way, had never written a script, had just never done it.  But I didn't have any doubts that I could do it.  But, you know,  there's always a format, there's always a technique to anything, any job and I learned that. The one problem I think I always had was, it was difficult for me to write short.  I had a tendency to want to go on and on and on forever.  But, with the help of a lot of good people, the Jeffs, the Jims, the photographers.  The photographers can be really key to your story.  As Bob Gambill, the news director, used to always tell me, "There are no stars in the news room, this is a team effort."  And that's totally true.  I mean, on-air people might get the most credit, but you don't get anywhere without all the behind the scenes people helping you so, there's no "I" in team.  So--I was always very cognizant of that.
Story_ID: 3763
Speaker 1: So I was asking you, this whole thing so--you don't have--you have a speech background, but you don't have a journalism background and so were you intimidated at all at the beginning or were you, you know, were you--.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not at all.  Cause that's--it must have been the ham in me that helped me to survive.  But like I said, I had a lot of good help.  The editorial editor helped me, we all sort of sat together, there were little cubicles.  And--Alan Jeffries was an editorial writer. Oh, he was a--. This man knew everything.  Anybody wanted to know anything--anybody in the newsroom that wanted to know anything, they came to Jeff.  I mean he knew everything.  And he told me--he showed me how to write a script, he said to me, "Barbara, the first thing you want to do on your script, get your clothes off."  Get right to the point, get right to it.  Make it tight.  Make it so that anybody from eight to eighty can understand it.  And then there was Jim Hetherington who was the editorial writer that helped me in how to write a script. Like I said before, photographers, a photographer can make you or break you.  Our news director, Bob Gambill, sort of instilled in us that you should work together, that there are no stars in the newsroom and that you should work as a team.  You find that if you work it out with your photographer, he can help you more than harm you because two heads is usually better than one.  Photographers go everywhere, they just about seen the interviews on everybody.  They know how the place can be lit, because they've been there a thousand times, and they always usually have very good suggestions.  So I found photographers to be invaluable.
Story_ID: 3764
Speaker 1: And then, you know, before I started working there [Channel 6, WRTV, Indianapolis, Indiana] and this is what I tell young women who are going with, dating young men or young women that are married, you know, it's a good idea just to sit down and talk to your mate about your job, because it's not an easy job.  It's not--it looks glamorous, but it's all time consuming.  There were times when I was out of town for maybe a week at a time, with a man, you see.  How do their wives feel about you?  I'm not thinking anything about the guy, you know. But those are just, you know, it came to the point where, you know, we [she and husband, Theodore 'Ted' Boyd] had to talk about how roles had to change a little bit.  I mean, how he'd have to take care of the kids maybe, you know, maybe I wouldn't get home at five o'clock or six o'clock.  Maybe I didn't get home until eight.  Maybe he'd have to start dinner, you see. So these are things that you just have to--. You know, it's very helpful if your mate understands what you're doing and can accept it, you see.  And after a while and after I got to be known, you know, people would be very insensitive and say, "Mr. Barbara Boyd."  You know, you got to have a strong man, a man that feels good about himself and knows what he's about to take that kind of crap, you see.  And it doesn't bother him any more, I'm sure that it did initially.  But had it not been for Ted Boyd and his support, and filling in the gaps where mom was supposed to be, I couldn't have made it, without his blessings and without the kids being cooperative.
Speaker 2: Now, you have--.
Speaker 1: We have three children, a daughter  [Karen (Boyd) Beamon] and two sons  [T. Brian Boyd, Darren F. Boyd].
Speaker 2: And when you got the job, you already had the three children.
Speaker 1: Already had the children and was old, I was forty years old when I started in the business, that's old for television.  You know, today, you know,  when everything is around: "Youth is everything." That didn't bother me at all.  I was just grateful for the opportunity and grateful that I had the kind of husband that would give me that kind of support.  Cause when he said, honey, you know, I think at the time we had only been married eighteen, I don't know.  He says, "You know, you supported me all these years, now it's your turn, go for it."  And he's been behind me in every venture I've had, good and bad, through all my illnesses, and I've had some doozies.  He'd always been right there.  And so you know, when I go out to give talks to young men and women, you know, before you go in your business, sort of sit down to your mate and talk about if you know what this business is like and the kind of time that you're going to have to spend in it.  It's time consuming, it's intense.  And of course, you know, just getting into the business, I wanted to give my all, you know, I just wanted to be right in there.  It didn't make any difference how many hours I had to spend, I wanted to be there.  I didn't care where I had to go, I wanted to go.  And he allowed me to do that.
Speaker 2: That's pretty fabulous. That's very fabulous.
Story_ID: 3765
Speaker 1: Let me ask this, was--how did the black community react?  This was a big thing for you.
Speaker 2: Oh honey, I wasn't really aware of that until after a while, you know. I wasn't aware until after a while the impact I had on the black community--well on the community, period. And I think, you know, when you get out and you hear feedback, you know, I hear it now, "Oh Barbara's a legend," you know,  "Barbara's a pioneer." You know, kids will come up to me--young adults will come up to me now--and say, "Oh, I heard you give a talk at my school and it just really (unclear, points to heart) right here." I'm sorry, I'll start that over. Okay. I didn't realize the impact I had on this community until after a little while. You know, right now I'll go out into the community, after being retired for six years, and I'm surprised people even remember, but they'll say, you know, "Ms. Boyd, I remember when you came to my high school or my elementary school and spoke to us and how impressed I was and just to see a black woman on television in Indianapolis [Ind.]," you know.  And caused me to think about my career. Or even older women.  And very often I'll say to older women, even if you are forty and if there's something you want to do or something you felt you always wanted to try, try it, you know.  Forty is not the end of the world.  And--I think most of my impact came after I had--I did a story on my own mastectomy from my hospital bed.  And to this day, women will come up to me and say, "I saw that, it changed my life."  You know, "Made me feel that I could go on and live a normal life and survive, you know."
Story_ID: 3766
Speaker 1: Let me ask about that because what I found, you know, in reading the material on that, it was impressive and I'll tell you why.  I mean, I'd like to know the story behind the story of even how you did that [covering the story of her own breast cancer struggle]. And the reason I say that is, it was 1973, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, '72 or '73 [1972, 1973], I can't remember.
Speaker 1: And you, you know, I mean, to be so, it's still like, there's a woman in Chicago [Illinois] who is well known, Jewel Lafontant [MANkarious, attorney, federal appointee], she died of breast cancer recently.  She didn't want anyone to know.  And there was a point, you know, where cancer was almost like AIDS [Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome] in a way, people did not talk about it.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, people thought you could catch it.
Speaker 1: Right. And so I'm just wondering what brought you to that point because you had been at the station, let's see--.
Speaker 2: Since '69 [1969]
Speaker 1: '69. So you hadn't been there all that long. So here you've had this very wonderful thing happen and then, you know,  this other thing happens and I'm just wondering--.
Speaker 2: Let me tell you how this came about.  I had done a story on Reach to Recovery, which is the support group for mastectomies.  And--had to be very careful about how I did that story because, here we were talking about breasts and you know, you just don't talk about body parts on TV, even at that time.  So, when I went for my examination--you see, I had seen a movie on--distributed by the American Cancer Society--on breast cancer and how you should practice self breast examination.  I had seen that many years ago.  So I always practiced examining myself.  And so when I found my lump, I went to the doctor on my lunch hour and he couldn't find anything.  And I said, "Oh, something is there.  You just have to feel a little harder cause it's there," cause it was very tender.  So sure enough, okay.  I had three exams, three opinions.  I went to my doctor, I went to station's doctor and then, the surgeon. Checked me out.  After I had this last exam, I'm coming home--I'm coming from the doctor's office, going back to work--and I'm a little full because he says, you know,  "Maybe we should have a biopsy."  And I'm trying to really be brave about this thing.  I don't want to really cry.  So I'm trying to sing, you know, up here (gestures a high level) and not let the tears come and I found that once I got to work and got busy, you know, I just sort of cleared up.  And then I had the--had to go in and he said, "I tell you, I'm going to--if we find something, I'm going to do the whole thing."
Story_ID: 3767
Speaker 1: So while I'm sitting in the hospital bed I said, "What a great story.  What a great story." Cause I had just done this thing on Reach to Recovery [mastectomy support group], what a great story.  Never thought about, you know--.  So I called the assignment editor and I said, "Tom, I'd like to do a story on Reach to Recovery," that's what I was really doing the story on.  But, you know, I had explained, why am I sitting here in this hospital bed, you know, if I'm doing this story on Reach to Recovery, and so I talked about it.  How I had practiced self breast examination, found a lump, had the operation and then we had a woman to come in and do an interview with me.  She brought in a prosthesis, must have been that big, this is where the humor comes in,  I punched the prosthesis, I said, "Obviously for a larger lady (laughs)."  Honey, the phones rang off the hook.  Off the hook.  And let me tell you, before any story goes on the air, it's always checked.  Well at that time we were doing film.  Well he was late editing and it had to just drop it in.  Nobody got a chance to check it.  Nobody got a chance to check the timing.  The piece was seven minutes long, now that's unheard of.  But we used to have a segment where it was a special, you could maybe have five minutes.  This one was seven minutes long, a record time on the air.  And when the story was over, our anchor person [Channel 6, WRTV Indianapolis, Indiana], Howard Caldwell was red as a beet, cause they didn't really quite know the content of the story.  And like I said, they said we got over five hundred calls on that story and one man called and said, "I know that Barbara Boyd does a lot but please, I know she ain't sitting up in the hospital bed saying she had breast cancer."  And that was the only doubting Thomas and from that, from that one story, we went around the country--I went around the country--doing stories on talk shows, answering questions on breast cancer. I remember one in particular, we went to Cleveland [Ohio], 'Morning Exchange,' Fred Griffith [WEWS Channel 5 Cleveland-Akron], I believe his name was--is.  And so he's getting really heavy with the questions you know (imitates serious interviewer), "Mrs. Boyd, I mean, how did you really feel?'  I mean blah, blah, blah, "I mean did you--how did your husband feel?"  Well I said, "He's here, you can ask him."  Mr. Boyd [Theodore 'Ted' Boyd] comes around--comes on stage, "How did it make you feel, Mr. Boyd, I mean, here's your wife," you know. "Did you think she was near death?  Did you think the loss of a breast would--." Oh, I mean he's getting really heavy with it.  He looked at Fred and he said, "Well all I can say is, just one less boob to answer."  Oh, on national television (laughs)!  We're going back on the plane, here I'm off for about fifteen, twenty minutes talking about serious breast cancer and Ted's on in his two seconds and he makes a statement, we're going back on the plane and a woman looked at him and says, "Oh, I saw you on T.V. this morning."  But it sort of changed me, it sort of catapulted me in the community because you see, in the early days of television you never saw the reporter too much.  It was voice over the sound.  And there wasn't the identification of the reporter so much, it was later on that they wanted you to be identified by doing a stand up or a stand up bridge or an open.  And so many people knew my voice, but didn't see me that often because reporters just didn't put themselves in unless it was for a cut away shot or something of that nature.  And so after a while, people began to know who I was.  And--you know, people would just call me at any time, "Well my sister had it and this is what, you know, we did."
Speaker 2: This is what I'm curious about. Your ability to take your--it was almost like an uncanny ability to take yourself out of yourself for that moment--in time to--in order to do the story.  I mean it was just, it came to you.  It was like you were almost separated from yourself in some respects.  Do you think?
Speaker 1: I just never really thought about it as being a big deal.  I really didn't, Julieann [Julieanna Richardson, interviewer].  And my mother-in-law sort of put it in perspective for me.  You know, because they were all saying, you know, "How brave of you to do a story like that," you know.  I'm saying, "Brave? What was so brave about it?"  And my mother-in-law says, "Well you know, you got to consider that not too many years down the road woman didn't hardly even want to go out pregnant.  And for you to get on television and talk about something as personal as breasts, you know, was quite a courageous, brave thing to do.  I say, "Well, I guess if you put it like that."  But I was just thinking in terms of, this is a great story.  And you see, what they always used to talk about too was, reporter involvement.  Well I mean, how involved can you get in something like this.  But I never thought of it in terms of it being a courageous, brave thing to do.  But it just turned out to be one of those--THE story for me.
Story_ID: 3768
Speaker 1: And then so, how did that [news coverage of her own breast cancer] change your career at that point?
Speaker 2: Oh hey, other stations wanted me, you know.  I got this offer from, I won't name the station, but it is so funny. And it was so funny, I had this contract in my purse that I had been given for X amount of dollars, and another station asked me to come over to them.  I didn't really want to go there because I enjoyed working at 6 [Channel 6, WRTV Indianapolis, Indiana], but the money was phenomenal.  So I told my boss and he said, "What did you say?"  I said, "I didn't say anything, you know, what are you going to say?"  Well he goes upstairs and talks to the boss and a couple days pass and the other station calls and he said, "Well what's your answer?" and I said, "Well I haven't heard anything." And he says, "Well, we have to know this afternoon."  So I told my boss, "I got to know today." Now mind you, they come back down with a contract.  Mind you, I already had a contract in my purse that I hadn't signed for diddley squat amount of money.  But all of a sudden, somebody else wants me and I'm up here (gestures high level).  So I stayed with 6, you see.  And come to find out, this is something they don't share with you, a survey had been taken in the community that Howard Caldwell and Barbara Boyd, they had the highest ratings.  See, you don't know these things about yourself.  You can go there and work for diddly squat forever, until somebody else wants you, unless you have some kind of leverage, you know to--.  And I never thought about it.  I was just content to be working there and to get my little raise when I get it.  Cause I was so happy to be there.  But those are the things that you learn.
Speaker 1: Now were those in the days where you had--did you have an agent?
Speaker 2: No, I never had an agent.
Speaker 1: So you represent yourself?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And there is another interesting thing, shows you how unbright I am.  I had this offer to come to Chicago, [W]BBM [CBS Channel 2 Chicago, Illinois].  Everybody in the business, everybody, has a tape of their work, but me.  Honey, I go up to Chicago with this bag of tapes (laughs).  A bag of tapes.  And this guy, he looks at all these tapes, they offered me a job up there.  But after Ted and I talked about it, you know, our children were here--and in Chicago, we didn't want to do that.  You know, I'm forty something years old now and I just don't really want to make another move.  And not only that, but I did it just for the heck of it, I sent the tape--not a tape. Yeah, I did. I finally got a tape together.  I don't even know what was on it, probably was only one story.  I don't know what it was, but to KRON [Channel 4, San Francisco Bay Area] in California, and they were interested.  But again, I decided I didn't want to make a move, didn't want to live in California. You know, I just enjoy working at 6.  I tell you, I really enjoy my work.  I enjoyed going to work everyday.  It was fun to get paid for being--for having fun.  It was a job that I learned something about something or somebody everyday.  And it was a challenge to come up with something different, putting a new twist to a certain--there aren't that many stories that are that new or different, but it's the twist that you give the story.  And, you know, after a while, I became the consumer reporter.  I remember when Bob Gambill says, "We want you to be the consumer reporter, telling people, you know, the good prices and the bad places," and you know, what consumer reporters do.  So I did one story on consumer reporting, you know, and that was it.  And he said, "Well, no, I want you to develop a beat."  I said, "Oh."  So I became a franchise reporter.  That's all I had to do was consumer stuff.  And then we had beats, the beat system at our station.  It was a city county reporter, there was the police reporter, there was Reed Duffy that did the gourmet restaur--that did the restaurants, and I did consumer reports.  And got to be, you know, really well known for that.
Story_ID: 3769
Speaker 1: So what were some of the stories that you worked on that were probably the most memorable, or that you had the most fun with or that you got notoriety also, besides--?
Speaker 2: The one that I think that was really most interesting for me, you know, aside from interviewing movie stars and stuff like that, was one on a commune, in southern Indiana, called Padanaram.  And Padanaram was operated by an Apostolic Minister that was here in Indianapolis [Indiana] and took about forty people down to this site, near Shoals, Indiana.  And--they worked--they had a logging business and they didn't have a phone. We just took--the photographer lived in Jasper [Indiana] and he knew about it so we just went out, down there, just hoping we could get a story.  So we drove on down and as we were driving into their camp, there was just all these trees made an archway and then there was this huge opening and there was this huge log cabin, round log cabin with a fireplace--with a chimney--coming right up through the house.  So we went there and we were asking for the head guy, Daniel Wright, was the leader. Well I didn't know I was talking to Daniel.  I said, "We're looking for Daniel Wright".  So he says, "Where are you from, 'The Star'?" (imitates country bumpkin voice). 'The [Indianapolis] Star' is our newspaper here and I said, "No, television."  "From 'The Star'?"  I said, "No, pictures, television."  He said, "What you want?"  I said, "We came down here to Daniel--to talk to Daniel Wright to do a story on your operation."  He says, "Well we about to take lunch, come on in."  So we went in--just as we were geting ready to go in, young boy came out and he says, "Mrs. Boyd," he says, "I know Mr. Combs."  And Mr. Combs was this weather guy at the station, weekend weather.  He said, "He used to be my Sunday school teacher."  I said, "Oh, how nice."  So there was a friendly face.  We went on in to have lunch and so while we were sitting there, found out this was Daniel.  I said, "You got any black people here?"  So he said, "Yeah, we got a black man here.  He takes care of our money.  Does all our purchasing."  I said, "Oh, isn't that fine."  Honey, I look up and here comes a black man, and I know him.  He's my girlfriend's uncle.  And they didn't know where he was, they hadn't seen him in umpteen years.  Well, well, we were in after that.  So I did the story on--and Daniel was a stalwart character, he had this huge beard and a hat that sort of crooked to one side with a hole in it and twinkly blue eyes and coveralls, you know.  He's the leader. And it's very interesting there, all the women are very subservient there.  They're the nesters.  They're there just to have children and to take care of the men folk and to take care of what women supposed to do (imitates old-time male voice).  And they might work three days, off four.  You know, I'm going to work three days and four days I'll take care of your kids and then we flip flop.  They cooked on wooden stoves. And they taught--they sent their kids to school, but they only had one phone and that was for business--that was for the logging business.  No television, no radio.  Because you see, Padanaram is supposed to be a utopian kind of society where no man covets what you have.  No jealousies.  You work if you want to work.  But you're going to work because you're going to feel badly if you don't when you see your brother's working, you see.  If you want something (unclear)  and he'll give it to you.
Speaker 1: Every time you cover it up, I can't hear what you're saying.
Speaker 2: It was the kind of place--Pandanaram was the kind of place--if you want something, if you feel you have a need, you go to them and they'll give it to you. But you're not going to want for anything because everything is there for you, you see.  So I asked several of the women, you know, "What is it, why are you here?"  And without exception, they all felt Daniel was sort of a father figure.  One woman had lost her husband, Daniel filled that need.  Another woman, you know, her husband had left her, so here she was, the commune was her family.  There was a man there who was, you know, a six--you know, a big business man, worked for GM [General Motors] or somebody.  He was tired of the rat race, came here to Padanaram. And so we ran that story like on a weekly--you know, I think that story ran for a week, we did a segment each day.
Story_ID: 3770
Speaker 1: And I went back ten years later, "Padanaram Revisited."  Hey, the coveralls are gone.  The old beat up hat with the hole in it is gone.  Daniel [Wright, commune leader] comes up and meets me in a Cadillac [automobile].  He's got on the corporate uniform with the blue jacket and the khaki pants and the Oxford [style] shirt.  "Let me show you around my place," he says.  They have their own school now.  His son and daughter are graduates of IU [Indiana University] and they teach there--they have their own--teach there.  They have their own little fire department.  They have their own--they grow their own food.  I think they even have their own electrical power from somewhere.  Each--I think in October they have a big festival, where they make their candles.  You know, make hand-crafted stuff and people come there and go through the camp.  Now they have a place for the single men to stay and the single women and for the marrieds.  And before, they had this one place and you had a cubicle.  If you had a family of three, you all stayed in that room and that room was about that big, enough for a bed and a dresser maybe.  Now everybody has their own quarters.  So they had really it going--now they do--they not only do logging, but they make log homes.  They have a place in Blooming--I think they have an office in Bloomington [Indiana]--at least they did the last time I did the story, they had had an office in Bloomington.  So now they have big business. Then the next thing I look up, 'National Geographic' [magazine] had done a story on them.  So, that was a very interesting story.  What was really interesting is, that Daniel came to Indianapolis [Indiana] one day and he stopped by the station.  So I said, "Come on, I want you to be on the noon show, we can do an interview."  So I pulled up some of the tape from the previous show.  And while we were sitting there, he had a hole in his coverall and he said, "Barbara, you ought to get a needle and thread and sew up Daniel's hole."  I said, "Look here, Daniel, you ain't talking to one of your Padanaram women, I don't sew up my husband's clothes--his pants, you know."  You know what he told me, he says, "You know what, for a colored woman, you're pretty intelligent" (laughs). I mean, you know, there's no changing somebody like that, you know?
Speaker 2: But see the black guy that was there, was there  black women there?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: That's interesting.
Speaker 1: He was the only black person there.
Speaker 2: So what did you report back?  I mean that must have been a report--.
Speaker 1: Well I called my friend and told her he was there.  Whether she got in touch with him or he got in touch with him [sic, her], I don't know.  But he knew me right off.  We just grabbed one another and hugged one another.  But that's the most interesting story that I've ever done.  And it'a a little--and I tell you, I think one of the stories that I got the most calls on, and you would think it was a nothing little story.  But it was a story about a guy who repaired cracks in your car window.  This was a long time ago and everybody does it now.  But then it was new.  And I bet you, until almost to the time I left that station, I'd get at least one call every six or seven months.  "You know that story you did back in 19--, do you still have that guy's number?" (imitates inquirer's voice) You know, unreal.  I had just umpteen calls about the guy who could fix the cracks in your car window.
Story_ID: 3771
Speaker 1: So, let me ask, do you have views, having worked in the media, about, you know, media's role in society? (Pause) Did you ever--were you very reflective on media's role in society? You know, what impact it has?
Speaker 2: That media have on society?  Honey, tremendous.  I didn't realize how much impact it had until I went out into the community and you know, people emulate.  Or, what do I want to say, hold on to every word you say as truth.  If I go into a grocery store, "Oh I know this must be a good place to shop 'cause you're here."  Or, "You said, so and so and so," so it has to be true.  So you know, it's very important, very important that reporters are very careful about what they say and about what they do.  Because you're impacting young children that are watching and holding on to every word you say.  In a sense, you know, you are sort of up here with people (gestures a high level).  So, you know,  it's important for you to be credible, factual and to the point on your stories.  Because, whether you know it or not--and I didn't realize that until I went out into the community, and people began to say, "Oh, I saw so and so and you said, blah, blah, blah."  And you just, I don't know, you don't think about it at first--I didn't think about it at first.  Not that you're going to do anything different because that's what you're supposed to do as reporters but it's just a reminder, if you think you might stray from the track, don't.  Because what you say and do is so important because people holding on to every word you say.  I mean they used to, they get to not so much that way because they begin to sort of doubt the media a little bit, you know.  'Cause my husband used to--Ted [Theodore Boyd] used to always say to me, "You all always checking folks out. Who checks you out?"  And I'm always, "Nobody has to check us out because we're always going to do the right thing."  (Laughs) Not so, you know. So--.
Story_ID: 3772
Speaker 1: So did you, you know, a lot has changed--did you see change during the time you were there, you know, because, you start out as reporting, you know, as an industry, it then became a business, do you have any thoughts about that?
Speaker 2: There has been a lot of change in television since I was in it.  Number one, I was the first African American female on television, in Indiana.  And I think I was the only woman in the newsroom for about four years.  And, you know, little statements would be made like, "Get the broads out of broadcasting."  Joking, but--or, "Honey, can you fix the coffee?"  And I--and it was so gradual. First we saw one or two other women doing various things.  You know, they were producing.  Then another female reporter.  And it just sort of--all of a sudden you looked around and we had producers, directors.  Newsrooms over half female now.  I bet you there are more females now, in the business, than males. You know, of course you don't see many female photographers.  We used to have one [Channel 6, WRTV Indianapolis, Indiana].  Channel 8 [WISH-TV Indianapolis] used to have one.  I don't know if anybody has one now.  But, I think bringing women to television brings another perspective.  I don't want to say a softer, gentler side but just another side that maybe a man wouldn't think about bringing to a story.  As a mother, as a grandmother, as a female, I think sometimes you see something that males don't see.  If you see--I think males are so intent on the news being hard and to the point, cause they don't want to do anything soft because that's not a macho thing.  But sometimes it requires you to go around the hard, the rough edges and get to the soft meat, inside.  You know, the human aspect of a story, that some men don't feel comfortable doing, I don't think.  And some women don't either.  But I think women, who I think have a more nurturing kind of nature, would have a tendency to maybe dig a little deeper into the humanistic side of a story.  Even a murder, you know, in presentation if nothing else, you see.
Story_ID: 3773
Speaker 1: Technology, goodness sakes.  When computers came to the newsroom, I was sitting there like this (makes a scared face) Howard Caldwell and I [Channel 6 WRTV Indianapolis, Indiana]. Of course by this time, we've got all young people in the newsroom.  We're probably the oldest two codgers sitting up there.  And they all know how to do computers.  And the day they say you can't use your typewriter any more (imitates crying)--what do you mean? But you know, it's just something you learn.  Everything is faster now, goes and moves. Digital editing.  Matter of fact when I first started, they used to send a tape recorder out with you.  Every reporter had a tape recorder.  That was a crutch, I thought.  You had a tendency to put the tape recorder up there and listen to everything and then get back to the station and hear what they said.  And if something went wrong with your tape recorder, there you were, hung out, because you're depending on the tape recorder, you haven't really recorded it up here (points to head).  So I got rid of mine.  I didn't depend on that anymore.
Story_ID: 3774
Speaker 1: But so much has changed, I mean, just attitudes have changed.  I don't know whether they're for the better or not.  You know,I think when I first started there was a real loyalty to the business.  You know, if you worked for a station you had pride and you stayed there and did what you had to do or went out on that extra story.  If it required something extra for the ten o'clock news, if you had an edition, you'd want to do that.  I find now, and I think, there's no real loyalty to your station, you don't really have any pride in it.  Everybody's coming to make a tape to go to the Net tomorrow.  It's just a whole--it's like society today, it's just "Give it to me quick.  Get there's--get mine as quick as I can and go on."  That's just the way I feel about it, that's what I sort of see.  I don't think that many of the reporters today don't even know how to pronounce words, let alone spell them.  You have to learn how to spell because you've got captioning now.  So you had to learn how to spell.  But those are just some of the things that I have seen.  They don't have the loyalty that they had, they don't have the real concern of pride in where they work and they're here quick to go today and go on somewhere for tomorrow.
Speaker 2: Now what about--how about African Americans here, in Indianapolis [Indiana], in the media, has it changed, has it improved in that time period?
Speaker 1: Oh sure, it used to be that we didn't have any more than two ever on the air.  Not ever.  That was the magic number, two.  I think one station here has five.  I think everybody has more than two now.  I haven't taken any count, but I think everybody has more than two.  You have black photographers.  You traditionally have the administrative job as the public affairs person or human resources person, who are able to make some decisions.  But I don't think we're yet, really higher echelon of television, not in this town.  Might be elsewhere, but not here.  But I think we're beyond the two stage.  We have producers, black producers now.  That didn't used to be when I was first starting, that's a plus.  Early morning and news shows.  Those are the people that you don't see, you know, that nobody knows about, they're there.
Speaker 2: So you're hopeful for the future.
Speaker 1: I am very hopeful.  You know and I think black reporters bring a another perspective too.  There's just some things white folks don't know about, that black folk do.  It was just like, when we had the many riots on the Avenue, Indiana Avenue [Indianapolis, Indiana],  I don't think a white reporter could have gone down there. Probably did cause at the time, I think there was only one black reporter in town that was Carl Stubblefield, he started in '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: (Pause)
Speaker 1: I think that black reporters bring a different perspective too. I mean there are just some things white folks don't know what to ask, you know,  when they're dealing with black folk. For instance when there were many riots down on Indiana Avenue back in the 70s [1970s]. Carl Stubblefield was the only black reporter around. I'm sure the other stations sent somebody, but I don't think they got what he got because they wouldn't have been able to get as close to the people as he was able to get, and get that extra input cause they probably wouldn't have trusted white reporters.  Even though all the photographers were white, you know, his life was a little shaky at the time.  But I mean, you know, there's just--everybody brings something to the pot and I think black people bring another perspective.
Speaker 2: Now when you were inducted into the Indiana Hall of--is it the Indiana Hall--?
Speaker 1: I was inducted first into the Indiana Association of Black Journalists' Hall of Fame.  And just recently, this year [2000], I was inducted into the Indiana Journalism Hall of Fame, the first African American female to be inducted in--inducted.  Quite an honor, I felt good about it.
Story_ID: 3775
Speaker 1: How did this hairstyle come about?  It all came about in 1988.  I have worn this style since 1988.  For about sixteen or seventeen years, I co-hosted the United Negro College Fund Telethon.  Well, this particular year, I had been so busy I had forgotten to get my hair done.  And you know how it is with ladies when they first get their hair done, they're sort of tight and you know, not the best looking.  So I said to my daughter [Karen (Boyd) Beamon], "Oh, I forgot to get my hair done and when I get it done it's just going to look so tight and yucky."  So she said, "Well have Roz braid your hair for you."  Well I'm thinking about these braids that are hanging down, you know, I said, "Oh, I'm too old for that."  So she says, "No, she'll develop something just for you." Or she'll develop something for  you.  So when I went, this is the style that she gave me.  And she won't--she doesn't do it for anybody else--she won't do it for anybody else, this is MY hairstyle.  I think she does it for one other woman out of state.  This is--you know, if you don't know my voice, or you see my head, you know it's Barbara Boyd.  And it's maintenance free, I just love it.  I can go out and do a stand up, the wind is blowing and I don't have to worry about it.  I go to bed at night, wrap it up, don't worry about the next day, just go.
Speaker 2: You know what's interesting about--, one, it has such a signature look; two, it's not, you would think that someone who is on major TV wouldn't be comfortable with that.  It says a lot about you is what I'm saying, I think.
Speaker 1: What because it's so Afrocentric?
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: Oh no.
Story_ID: 3776
Speaker 1: But that brings me to another thing.  Here in Indianapolis [Indiana]--you're from--you know, at first I was going to ask you, how you, you know, found it living in Indianapolis after, you know, being raised in Chicago [Illinois], but I realize you were raised in Evanston [Illinois] so it's a little difference, little, little different. But this community--what I find intriguing about it, as compared to both communities, we have a larger African American population, you know it's a larger city.  But you, here in Indianapolis, you've got the Black Expo [Indiana Black Expo, Inc.] that's larger than our Expo, you've got the Circle City Classic [co-sponsored weekend of entertainment].  I remember when I was growing up, the only thing I heard coming out of Indianapolis was the Indianapolis--
Speaker 2: 500 Race [Indianapolis 500 race, racecar competition].
Speaker 1: And it's a whole different demeanor that this city has right now--.
Speaker 2: Well, we used to be called 'Nap Town.'  But no longer, we're now 'Indy.'  And people are so surprised when they come here.  You know, when we moved here in '62 [1962], the tallest building was the City-County Building, twenty-five stories tall.  This was the skyscraper.  And--just like the change in the newsroom, this city began to change.  Old buildings went down, new buildings came up.  You were inviting outside people to come in and look at what we have. You see, this city has something different that a lot of cities don't have and that's the partnership between city government and private industry.  They work hand in hand.  They have an organization, a group here called GIPC, Greater Indianapolis Progress Committee.  Where there are--I guess they still have it, I used to be on that board--where you get input from private industry to city government.  They even--kick in money, I mean, look at our stadium, what the Simons [Herb and Mel Simon, developers and owners of the Indiana Pacers professional basketball team] have done in terms of bringing the Pacers to the city, bringing the [Indianapolis] Colts [National Football League team] to the city.  Getting that dome built and Market Square Arena.  All this has been in partnership with private industry.  We have a tremendous convention bureau, you know, what do you call that?
Speaker 1: Convention and tourism.
Speaker 2: Yeah, convention and tourism set up where they invite people in to see what we're doing.  It's just--White River [State] Park project, IMAX [enhanced movie viewing complex], Eiteljorg [Museum of American Indians and Western Art] all that.  Our amateur status in sports is just--honey, it's just the difference in night and day from 1962 to today.  I mean we're almost cavalier about it now but it's just, people are so surprised when then come here.  Boy, this is Indianapolis, I remember when I came back here and so and so, this was "India-no-place."  Great theater, many things to do.  Downtown has just sprouted up, got clubs.  Good shopping, the Circle Centre Mall [shopping mall] is fabulous. So yeah, Indianapolis is on the move, and so are black folk.  Black folk done pretty well here, I think.  I mean like anything else, it could be better, you know.  But I think we're getting there.  Still have to bide our time and move slowly but we'll get there.

Speaker 1: What--what are we going to hear from Barbara Boyd in the future?
Speaker 2: What would Barbara Boyd like to do?  I would like to make a national commercial.  You know, I've done a couple of movies.  And I've done commercials, you know, local commercials and some out of town commercials.  But I would like to make a national commercial. (Looks at the camera) Please?  I don't have many wants, I've been a very fortunate woman.  You know, to--you know, I always say, from adversity some good things can come.  I had breast cancer, it was bad.  The good thing about it is we got it all and somebody learned from what I had.  Our house blew up, we lost everything.  Good thing about it, we weren't in it.  And it strengthened our family ties.  Then, I had a perforated colon.  Wasn't cancerous, another good thing.  Again, strengthened our ties.  So you see, when you think you're at the end of your rope, there's always somebody up there looking out for you (looks up).  And you know I think it's very true, when my grandmother used to say, "Lord don't put no more on you than you can bear." And that's certainly true and I tell you, you know how you build a foundation for your children, you hope that when they grow up they can reach back and gather those strengths that you've built the bricks, the foundation strong enough for them to survive any kind of crisis.  And I think my parents did that for me cause I've had to reach back--and to gather, garner up some strength to go on.  But from each one of those bad experiences or adverse experiences, some good things did come.

Speaker 1: Your father [Ernest Andry], you said he passed away when?
Speaker 2: Oh no. My dad's been dead, must be--I don't think he ever saw me on T.V., so it must be twenty something years.
Speaker 1: What do you think he would have said about his daughter if he could see you?  What do you think he would have said?
Speaker 2: "I knew you coulda done it," he'd be bragging.  "I knew, I told you."  Just do what you got to do."  "See what I told you, just be prepared and you'll get there."  "Andry always makes a dollar if anybody can."  What was that he used to always say about a dollar, "If a dollar could be made, an Andry could make one of them."  "Andrys are superior to the world world. See there?"  Something that would probably embarrass me (laughs).  He was great though, he was great, just like my mom [Alberta Andry].  My mom still lives.  Now there's a fantastic lady.  My mom, she's going to die, my mom's ninety-six years old.  Wears no glasses, no medication, wears high heel shoes and is looking for a job.  Now we asked her to come down here and live with us but she said, "Oh no, I want my own apartment."  So she has her own apartment, does her own banking, does her own cooking, walks an hour every day.  And looks too cute.  So that's going to be the footsteps I have to follow in.  If I follow in that lady's footsteps, I'll be kicking for a long time.  And she's never been sick, never been in the hospital.  And you know what, doesn't drink water.  "Mom, you should have eight glasses of water a day."  I'm getting to thinking, this woman has lived ninety-six years and ain't been drinking water and she's doing fine. Later for the water, you know.
Speaker 1: Good gene pool there.
Speaker 2: Good gene pool.  Well my grandma lived to ninety-four, my mom's mother did.

Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: That she was a fun, honest person and that she tried to give back to the community what the community gave to her.  The community here gave me a lot, a lot.  They supported me, you know,  when I first started in the business, they supported me all the way.  And even when they took me off the anchor spot, there was support.  You know, a minor uprising, but you know how it is when new management comes in, they want to bring their own team in.  That's what happened to me.  But that she was a giving person, a sharing person and a fun person.

Speaker 2: 1991. This is a local magazine, 'Indianapolis [Indiana] Monthly.'

Speaker 1: Okay this is a family picture must have been taken in about 1963 or 4 [1964] at the Fall Creek [Indianapolis, Indiana] YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association]. To the far left is my mother, Alberta Andry, better known as 'Peaches;' and next to her is my husband Ted [Theodore Boyd]; then there's old 'Bar-boo' in the middle; and then my mother-in-law, James Ella Boyd; and next to her, her busband, Theodore Boyd; and there's our first child, Karen. Karen must have been about nine at the time.
Speaker 2: This is 1961?
Speaker 1: Maybe. No. Had to have been '62. Unless we were down here visiting, you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: We hadn't moved here yet. Maybe it was '61.  Any of the sixties. I just don't remember. Said '61 [1961] on the back. It could be that we were here visiting.  I just don't remember.  The moral of that story is put the date on the back of your pictures when you get them. You know, all pictures used to come with the date on them.
