Story_ID: 296788
Speaker 1: This first section of the interview deals with your early life and I'd like to begin by asking if you would please state your parents' names, first, middle and last and tell me where they were born?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is, or my mother's name was, Dorothy Mae Logan.  Her maiden name was Horton, H-O-R-T-O-N.  And she was from Greenville, Mississippi. And my father's name was Simuel, S-I-M-U-E-L, Morris Logan and his home was Greenwood, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: And do you remember when they were born?
Speaker 2: My dad was born on May 26, 1913 and my mother was born on December 11, 1920.
Speaker 1: And they're both from Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you remember your grandparents--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --on either side?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And if so, would you tell us a little bit about them?
Speaker 2: My grand--my paternal grandmother's name was Sally Logan [ph.] and she was just a beautiful person.  Always, always with a smile and always positive.  That's what I remember about her.  I--my memories of my grandfather, paternal grandfather, are not as clear and then perhaps they are.  I remember him when he was a superintendent of the Sunday school and he used to always have a, a pocket full of pens.  He was a very intelligent man.  Talks, talks very intelligently.  Used very good English.  I remember that about him.  And I guess that's what kind of stood out. And he; he impressed you as being more than what he was.  Not that he had airs or, or, or he had an ego or that type of thing, but if you looked at him you would think that he was--and what I mean by that is that he was a sharecropper--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and even if you saw him, his persona was not that of a sharecropper, that's for sure.
Speaker 1: And what was his name, please?
Speaker 2: His name was Willie. Willie D.  I don't know what the D stood for.  But Willie D. Logan [ph.] that's who--. And my, my mother's--my maternal grandfather his name was Addic, A-D-D-I-C, Horton.  I remember he was a carpenter and he--it was my step-grandmother and Lord I can't remember her name right off now and I used to live with her in Kansas City [Kansas] during the summers.  I'll, I'll think of it in a minute.  But very sweet lady, but she was, she was my, my step-grandmother.  Yeah but I do remember, I do remember them.  And I remember that we enjoyed going to my paternal grandparents' house more so than my maternal grandparents' house.  I guess there were several reasons.  One is that, that would be a lot of kids at my paternal grandparents' home and so we got a chance to play a lot, you know. So the things were noticeably a lot quieter, nothing to really do but sit around when we went over and visited my maternal grandparents' house, and you know, we didn't enjoy going there very much.
Story_ID: 296789
Speaker 1: So can we stay with the subject of the paternal grandparents [Willie D. Logan and Sally Logan (ph.)] for just a few more minutes?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now you said there was always a lot to do there?  Does that mean that your father [Simuel Logan] was from a big family?
Speaker 2: The family was small.  His family, there--he had two brothers and a sister. That was, that was, that was the nuclear family you know of course yeah so it was not a large family not by you know black standards or certainly southern farm black folks standards you know.   Normally they were big families because you would want a lot of people working in the fields.  So no it was not a very large family.  Well I mean kids in the community and all came there and we had--and my cousin lived there with them.
Speaker 1: Now is all of that happening in Mississippi then?
Speaker 2: Yes, all of that was happening in Greenwood, Mississippi, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you mentioned just a little earlier that your grandfather Willie D. Logan--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --was the superintendent of the Sunday school?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Were all of the family members active in the church?  And if so, what church was that?
Speaker 2: It was Sweet Home, Sweet Home Baptist Church [ph.] in--it's actually not Greenwood, it's out in the country and I'm trying to think of the exact area.  You'll probably have to come back to that but it's, it was out in the country and this was not--they were not city folks by any means.
Speaker 1: So in a rural area of Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: A suburb perhaps of Greenwood?
Speaker 2: A suburb.
Speaker 1: Can we call it--.
Speaker 2: That's a stretch to call it a suburb.  It was a huge farm you know and you just drove way out in the country and on that farm you know sat this house you know and obviously there was a lot of cotton and, and they slaughtered animals and all of that type of thing for food, had a smokehouse and that kind of stuff and normally we went there during Christmas and during the Christmas holidays and of course that was the activity to you know slaughter animals and they was divided up and we'd always bring some back with us and all of that.  But you know it was very a festive occasion that normally happened during the Christmas holidays.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 296790
Speaker 1: Now I know you mentioned that both your parents [Dorothy Horton Logan and Simuel Logan] were from Mississippi--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --but then I think I heard you say you visited your [maternal] grandparents sometimes in, did you say Kansas City [Kansas]?
Speaker 2: Yeah (cough), my--I had--my mother's family was a very large family.  There, there were two girls and probably six or seven boys, so it was a large family.  And several of her brothers and her sister and her grandmother settled in Kansas City, Kansas City, Kansas, and I would go there during the summers and work, at least for a couple of summers.  That was while I was in college [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida]. And so that was the Kansas connection you know.  The people moved out of--and after my grandfather died, my grandmother then moved to Kansas City where my uncles and aunts were, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, so is that pretty much a rural to urban migration then?
Speaker 2: Oh for sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 296791
Speaker 1: So Greenville [Mississippi] is a smaller community in Mississippi (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's a small community.  I remember it being smaller than, smaller than Greenwood [Mississippi] and it was a very strange community too because there were a lot of Asians there and I used to always wonder where they went to school.  It was--and I tell you I am from Georgia and I know we're jumping ahead a little bit, but I--in Augusta, Georgia, there were a number of Asians there too.  And I always wondered you know, and no one ever answered that question for me to this day, where they went to school because I know that they didn't attend the black school and I know that they didn't attend--my assumption was they didn't attend the white school either.  So I always wondered where they went to school.  You know but I do remember that they were--there were a number of Asians in Greenville, Mississippi, and a lot of them were merchants.  I remember that very well.
Story_ID: 296792
Speaker 1: Maybe we can jump ahead a little bit now to get to your parents [Dorothy Horton Logan and Simuel Logan] meeting and marrying and then beginning their own family outside of Mississippi.  Now with both of them having roots in Mississippi, I'm wondering did they meet in that state also?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And can you tell me a little bit about how they met?
Speaker 2: Well I guess it was one of those--I don't really know the answer to that story but I guess the thing is that you know as guys did, they got in cars or buggies or whatever they had and they traveled to--you know Greenville [Mississippi] is not that far from Greenwood [Mississippi] and they traveled to these various areas and all and they met girls and that kind of thing.  But I know he--my impression is that he met my mom after he had finished, after he had finished college [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].
Story_ID: 296793
Speaker 1: My dad [Simuel Logan] left Greenwood [Mississippi] and went to Tuskegee [Alabama] where he, where he went to school, and he didn't have any money obviously.  So he worked his way through, through college there.  But I mean there was no, there was no, you know his parents [Willie D. Logan and Sally Logan (ph.)] sent him to school or anything like that, you know.  I imagine they did offer some assistance but he had to certainly work his way through school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And he was always very proud of that you know that he worked his way through college, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So your father attended Tuskegee Institute [Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama]?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: In Alabama?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And what did he major in there.
Speaker 1: He was an agriculture major.
Speaker 2: And that prepares you to do what, to continue in farming?
Speaker 1: Well no, he didn't do farming.  In fact he was really against that.  He knew that the future of black people was not in farming.  That was his, his idea anyway.  He knew that people were moving from farms and all, but it prepared him to first of all, teach agriculture which is very--that's not what really he taught, he ended up teaching--well he was very complicated.  He, he was hired I guess as an agriculture teacher, which meant that during the summers he had a--there was a big canning facility there and he ran that where people would bring their produce in to be canned.  He ran that during the summer.  Had a big steam boiler there and they would can this produce and I helped him in terms of doing that.  That's one of the things he did.  The other thing he did was things like plant diseases.  He would go around and help farmers who had, who had various plant diseases and he would also inoculate their animals and all.  He had these huge needles.  I would always remember that and he would inoculate you know, pigs, cows and horses and all of that stuff.  So I guess these are the kinds of things that you know he was prepared to, to, to do.  I'll add more to that a little bit later.  I kind of got an idea of where your questions are going.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know, yeah.
Story_ID: 296794
Speaker 1: You said your parents [Dorothy Horton Logan and Simuel Logan] met after your father finished his education at Tuskegee [Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  Okay so did your mother meet him in Alabama or--?
Speaker 2: In Mississippi.
Speaker 1: In Mississippi.  Okay you yeah, yeah you did mention that--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --they met in Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And then I'm trying to see how they get the family to Georgia.  How did that happen?
Speaker 2: That was his first job.  They married I guess in Mississippi--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and his first job was in Statesboro, Georgia.  I think he was there for a year and then he moved to a place called Thomson, T-H-O-M-S-O-N, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Now did your mother also attend college?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what college did she attend?
Speaker 2: She attended Allen University [Columbia, South Carolina] and Fort Valley State [College; Fort Valley State University, Fort Valley, Georgia], yeah.
Speaker 1: And what state are those you know in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Allen, Allen is in South Carolina.  Fort Valley State is in Georgia--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --in Fort Valley, Georgia, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I think you said, perhaps this was before the cameras were rolling, that both your parents were educators?
Speaker 2: Yes, they were.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And what did your mother teach?
Speaker 2: She taught elementary, the third grade.  In fact she was my third grade teacher, and she later taught special education.
Story_ID: 296795
Speaker 1: And were you an only child?
Speaker 2: No, I have two brothers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm the oldest of two.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Of three.
Speaker 1: Now tell me exactly when and where you were born and then when the other siblings came along.
Speaker 2: I was born in 1940, November the 24th, 1940 in Thomson, Georgia, is where I was born.  And I have a brother who was born in 1945 and another who was born in 1948.
Speaker 1: And what are their names please?
Speaker 2: The middle brother's name, Alvin Bernard [Logan] and the younger brother is Howard Ellis [Logan].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now with your profession as a composer and music educator here at the conservatory in Oberlin [Oberlin Conservatory of Music, Oberlin, Ohio], I'm curious about some of your early influences--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --in your life.  I know you said you spent some summers in Kansas City [Kansas]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --some people suggest that's the birth place of jazz--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --some say it's New Orleans [Louisiana].  But we'll have to get your opinion on where jazz was actually born.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But were you influenced by any Kansas City jazz and visiting with [maternal] grandparents (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well by then I was in college [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] and I was majoring in music, so while I was in Kansas City I heard a lot of music yeah no question about that and that was you know that was a residual of of jazz that--the jazz clubs that had been there.  I'm talking about now during the '60s [1960s] and there were quite a number of jazz clubs around.  They had quite a number of jazz musicians.  So I would, I would travel in circuit listening and all.  Nothing made a real--that much of an impression on me except that it was all played at a very high level and there were a number of clubs.  I mean you could just go from you know go down--I'm talking about [The] Paseo, 13th [Street] and Paseo.  You like going to Kansas City [Missouri], 12th [Street] and Vine [Street] and all of that.  I used to work around that area.  I worked on 13th [Street] and Paseo at a Clark Oil station so those nights I wasn't working I would go to those clubs.  The Street Hotel [Kansas City, Missouri] probably which is still there.  And I would go just go you know the, there's a strip down there and you go club to club and listen and there were a lot of very excellent musicians there.  So that impressed me.  The, the, the number of places to play and the number and, and the level at which it was being played which was very high, yeah.  But in terms of you know of the musical influences, no.  You know I had already, I had already kind of formed my ideas about you know playing and that kind of thing and you know they were doing the kinds of things that I was interested in.  Not that--but I wasn't really able to get it I guess is what I'm saying.  I wasn't a beginner when I was in Kansas City at all.
Story_ID: 296796
Speaker 1: Well let's go back to the beginnings (laughter).  Where did you attend elementary school?
Speaker 2: In, in Thomson, Georgia.  It was a very segregated town during that time.  In fact it was called McDuffie County Training School [Thomson, Georgia].  It still exists, but it's not called that anymore. And you--that school went from one through twelve, except by the time I got to high school the name of the--well first of all the high school, a new school had been built and this was in response to integration.  So they, they, they upgraded the black schools.  Everybody got a new school.  So by that time the school's name was R.L. Norris High School [Thomson, Georgia].  R.L. Norris had been one of the principals of that school there, and the school was named after him.  My father [Simuel Logan] incidentally eventually became principal of that school himself yeah.
Speaker 1: Now you said the new schools were built--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --for blacks in response to integration?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Was that to prevent you from integrating the white schools?
Speaker 2: Yeah, basically they thought that that would ameliorate our desires and we wouldn't want to go there to integrated schools yeah so we all got updated facilities.
Speaker 1: So was there still a push in the black community to desegregate the other institutions?
Speaker 2: No, I wouldn't--that was no real push as such.  You know you just knew that something was in the air but that that was no real drum beats.  You know no one around marching, anything like that.
Story_ID: 296797
Speaker 1: You know it was--we had one--you know it was separate communities [in Thomson, Georgia].  The only time you really came in contact with white people was when you went to town.  You know we had grocery stores all those kinds of things.  We had no need to go there.  So basically we were really separate communities.  We had our own businesses and all of that you know.  And if you went to town you came in contact with them but other than that you just see them come through or something like that you know.  You know that was it.  And there were a few that you played with.  I lived--where I lived there was a city park right behind my house.  In fact the fence was there and there were over on the other side of that park was some very wealthy white people.  People named Knoxs [ph.] and Lokeys [ph.] and Doziers [ph.] and those kinds of kids and we would play with those kids, you know.  They didn't have any problem playing with us and we didn't have a problem playing with them.  So you know they had nice toys.  They had electronic toys and all of that.  First time I saw you know a car with someone controlling it electronically you know they had it.  They had all of the new stuff so you know we played with them.  But other than that you know that was basically it.
Speaker 2: Well I'm thinking about this being the fiftieth anniversary year of the start of the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the lynching of Emmett Till--
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and you're a teenager when all this is going on--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --were you aware that in any other communities (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, very much, very much aware.  You, you were very much aware that these things were happening.  As I said before you know there was not a lot of activity in my, in my home town in terms, in terms of marching or people overtly saying anything about integrating the schools.  But there was something in the air.  But by the time I got to college, I'm talking about I left--I went to college when I was seventeen. By the time I got to college my freshman, sophomore years, yeah I had moved away then and, and things were very hot there.  Students were, were protesting.  I went to Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] and people were protesting, they had sit ins there, they had bus, the had a bus boycott in Tallahassee [Florida]--.  They were talking about the Montgomery thing but that was happening in various places.  They had that there.  I could remember my first taste of tear gas was in Tallahassee.  You know cops came up to break up a demonstration and we were in it and, and, and we got tear gassed and all so yeah but by the time I was eighteen years old yeah things were hot.  There was no question.  There was definitely a push to you know to integrate the schools as well.  And obviously that was the counter reaction to, to that yeah.
Speaker 2: So what was that demonstration about where you had the first taste of tear gas?
Speaker 1: That's a very good question.  I don't, I don't remember.  We were on our way to--Tallahassee was the--is the capital of Florida and we were on our way to the capitol [Florida State Capitol, Tallahassee, Florida] and the deal is that they stopped us.  The intent was that they were gonna stop us from going to the capitol but in terms of exactly what this demonstration was about, I--you know I don't really remember at this time.  But I do know that there was a girl there.  Her name was Patricia Stephens [HistoryMaker Patricia Stephens Due] and I know that she was very--she was a radical girl and all but and she had this big German shepherd dog.  She needed it to guard her and there were a lot of people around guarding her but she was, she was a very beautiful girl, played trumpet.  She sat right beside me and and but she was as radical as hell and I know that she was participating in demonstrations and would invite me to come to, to various things and all.  And these things that she invited me to go to were interracial kinds of things because there were a lot of white kids around there in Tallahassee who were interested in our cause let's say.
Story_ID: 296798
Speaker 1: I know we took a big jump from the--
Speaker 2: Didn't we?
Speaker 1: --the grade school days [at McDuffie County Training School, Thomson, Georgia]--
Speaker 2: Didn't we?
Speaker 1: --to the protest days.  Because you were talking--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --about the segregation so I think--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --that's what moved us in that direction. But I would still like to ask about the--the early musical influences in your life.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: And here's the question that we always put out.  What are some of your favorite sights, sounds and motions that remind you--or sights, sounds and smells and then we'll talk about the--the sights, sounds and smells that remind you of growing up in Georgia?
Speaker 2: Well, the, the first thing would be rhythm and blues.  I come from a rhythm and blues capital of the, of the world.  This is the--oh this story is, is gonna have many angles.  We're gonna digress and come back to many things.  But anyway some of the sights and sounds were rhythm and blues.  I grew up in a area where I saw people like Little Richard.  My father [Simuel Logan] had a community center.  Little Richard used to perform there.  I used to open the dressing room for Little Richard.  And Little Richard was way ahead of his time then.  I mean he came in and he had of course the pompadour hair, he had mascara on and he had these wild outfits on you know it was--he was just a wild person you know to the extent that I was a little leery when I went there to open the door because hey no, nobody--there was no one around who looked like that.  Nobody.  Nobody put those particular colors and all and fabrics together like that.  I saw Little Richard, James Brown.  I saw at a very early age Fats Domino.  I saw all those people and they were you know, I saw them a lot of times.  I mean I'm talking about it cost fifty cents to go to these dances and all that.  So that's the music that made an impression on me first of all.  And, and then from that jazz--excuse me--there was a band [Joe Liggins and the Honeydrippers] that came through, the name of Willie, Willie Liggins [sic.] from Los Angeles [California] and the real impression they made on me is that first of all it was a kind of a little big band.  They had arrangements and they were playing for music.  And I heard this piano player playing these, these very strange chords that for me I went up and asked him I said what, what is that you're playing?  He says these are thirteenth chords.  So I said what's a thirteenth chord?  So he told me, not that I understood, and I said well where did you learn that?  He said at a conservatory.  I said what's a conservatory?  So he--I was maybe eleven, twelve and and I, I stayed there and I talked with him for a long time.  He, he gave me a lot of information as you can see.  He explained to me what a conservatory was, explained to me what a thirteenth chord was and all that.  He let me know enough that I knew that I had to leave--then well the next--I'm kind of getting ahead of myself.  The next thing I saw is that book and they had a piece in there called 'Stardust' and I said I know that piece 'Stardust.'  You know by then I was playing the trumpet sort of when I was about eleven years old and, and two weeks I was playing the instrument.  I mean pretty well, enough to play in a school band with these old students.  I could play that well at, you know, just picking the horn up in two weeks.  (Laughter) But I had probably picked it up before then because my dad had a lot of instruments around the house.
Story_ID: 296799
Speaker 1: Professor Logan [HistoryMaker Wendell Logan], at the end of the last segment you had just started to tell us about some of the sounds and smells and sights that reminded you of growing up in Georgia, and you talked about your introduction to the trumpet around the age eleven.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So would you like to tell us a little bit more about this?  You said your father [Simuel Logan] had instruments all over the house.
Speaker 2: Well yeah that's what I can remember.  Earlier if I said something you asked what did my dad teach and I said that's very difficult to say what he taught.  Anyway my dad started the first music program in the schools there.  We had a music program before the white schools did and he started the first music program there.  Don't ask me how he got all of these instruments but somehow he had some arrangements with a guy, [A.J.] Schneider Music Company in Augusta, Georgia, and my dad had all of these instruments (laughter) that I guess he had, he had put himself in hock for. But the school [McDuffie County Training School, Thomson, Georgia] had a, had a music program and that's the beginning of of my music training there.  He was not a musician by, by training but certainly he was a pretty good you know musician, self-taught yeah.  But that was the beginning of my music training.  And this is what I meant when I said there were a lot of instruments around the house, various ones you know.  You could just pick something and if you wanted to play it and it was there.  So that was, that was the beginning of it.  And therefore when these musicians would come like Little Richard, James Brown and all of that I would go out and you know talk with the musicians and all and try to sit and those guys let me sit in with them, the Willie Liggins band [sic. Joe Liggins and the Honeydrippers] who had the arrangement of, of 'Stardust.'  I told him that I knew, I knew that tune started out as, "Doo, da, bah, bah, boo bah bah bah boo, bee, bee, bee" and so yeah I was there and they had you know they had another arrangement and all that and I said well this is for me.  This is what I want to do and I was eleven years old and I decided then that's what I always wanted to do and I knew that when I was eleven years old I knew that I would be a musician yeah.
Story_ID: 296800
Speaker 1: Then there were a lot of influences in your early life. You mentioned the Sweet Home Baptist Church [ph.]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and the sound of your [paternal] grandfather's [Willie D. Logan (ph.)]--.
Speaker 2: Yeah well let me go back to the Sweet Home Baptist Church.  My aunt had played piano there and her name was Brevis [ph.] and she and you notice they all had these strange names, real country names, but anyway Aunt Brevis moved to Chicago [Illinois] and I heard that she loved Lester Young.  They said that she--my Aunt Brevis really--and I don't know who I heard say that but they said that Aunt Brevis really loved Lester Young and that stuck in my mind.  I didn't know who the hell Lester Young was but I found out.  I went out and I went--across the street from Schneider music store [A.J. Schneider Music Company] was a record shop.  I went in there and they had these records there.  They had the Lester Young record.  So I went back across the street, I asked my dad [Simuel Logan] to give me some money to buy these records.  It must have been, I probably needed about twenty dollars which was a helluva lot of money then.  He did give it to me.  I went back I bought the Lester Young record.  I bought a Dizzy Gillespie record, I don't know why.  And I bought a Charlie Parker record I don't know why either.  But these are the records I bought.  Nobody told me about Charlie Parker.  Nobody told me about Dizzy Gillespie.  They had told me about Lester Young.  Dizzy Gillespie because he played trumpet obviously that's was an intro for me to that.  I never heard his music but he did play trumpet okay so so I got these records and I went home and I heard his music and my dad I remember saying he was an alto saxophone player and played in a style of Johnny Hodges.  He heard Charlie Parker and he didn't like it.  He didn't like it at all.  I loved it.  I--he didn't like the Dizzy Gillespie, I loved it.  I loved the Lester Young and all of that music and I decided then I said there's something that's going on in this music and nobody around here has the answers and I've got to leave here.  I remember, I remember that early on.  I mean I was thirteen years old but I realized that what those guys were playing was very powerful stuff and nobody around there could tell me a damn thing about it.
Speaker 1: So now what style of jazz was that that you were listening to?
Speaker 2: Bebop.
Speaker 1: Bebop okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah bebop and swing and you know and whatever Lester Young played.  It was you know he was this guy playing this very cool music you know and so I knew right off, right from a very young age that I had to leave there and go find the answers to what was happening in terms of that music.  There's no question about it yeah and which is it's a real lonely kind of experience you know to want to learn something and nobody is able to to answer your, your questions you know.  So it all worked out okay though. But I, I that, that music I heard, I heard James Brown as I said, Little Richard, Fats Domino I heard that, that made an impression.  I heard the people dancing to music by what's his name Tympany Five, 'Ain't Nobody Here But Us Chickens,' Lord God I'm looking at his face now but I heard that music and I heard the long meter hymns and spirituals all in church.  This is music I heard first of all.  That's the music that made an impression on me.  I didn't hear a symphony orchestra until I was eighteen years old.  I heard the Cincinnati Symphony [Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra].  They came to Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] to play and I heard them.  I was--had to be eighteen years old, my sophomore year.  But that was the first time I had heard a symphony orchestra.  Did I enjoy it?  Yes.  That was hey but if I hadn't--I'm saying that to say that the early music I heard was not that.  It was, you know something else.
Story_ID: 296801
Speaker 1: And then you know when I got to college [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], thank God I went to a school that for black schools at the time it had a very good music department.  No question about that.  They had some helluva teachers there and that's when they had teachers who were able to answer those questions I wanted to know about bebop and they had a lady there who was a very good theory teacher who turned me on to things like [Igor] Stravinsky's 'Firebird Suite' and you know I, I heard that and she gave me the score to it and we would discuss pieces like that, Twelve-Tone Theory, all of that kind of stuff.  We--you know she turned me onto that but there was so there were, there were these dual-there was this dual kind of education.  On the one hand you could get all these questions about jazz and on the other hand there were all these questions that you could get answered about classical music and the other thing I would appreciate all those teachers for is that there were no value judgments.  They--you didn't go there and you never heard this is better than that.  You know--it was all music and that's the way it was taught you know.  But there was never any kind of value judgment.  I didn't hear that until I went into these integrated kind of situations where I, I heard you know pejorative words used about jazz and, and black musicians.  But where I went to school--and I was a graduate student then at those schools, but when I went undergraduate school I, you know I will always thank those teachers for one giving me that kind of duality in terms of music training and, and showing me that it is possible to get a music education and I mean a real music education where all of it is covered and it's all treated as music at all, it's all of equal value so those are the things that I got in terms of you know undergraduate school.
Story_ID: 296802
Speaker 1: Well Professor Logan [HistoryMaker Wendell Logan] you told us a lot about those sounds that remind you of your early life.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 1: But how about some of the smells?
Speaker 2: Smells would be things like you know pot of collard greens and corn bread you know those kinds of things you know it was food that people referred to as soul food and I know my, my, my brother was talking and he was saying--we were talking about cooks.  And he said boy he said yeah your wife [Bettye Reese Logan] knows how to cook and all that.  He said but you know you ever thought that, he said she had some helluva teachers and he says there was mom [Dorothy Horton Logan]. I said yeah and she taught her, and he said that was Aunt Dell [ph.] who taught my mom how to cook.  I said yes she certainly did.  She had some heck of teachers so there's that kind of extension.  I have a wife who can cook all that food.  But thank God she doesn't do so but she certainly knows how to do it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah so those are the smells you know I think of.  You know a good, a good potato pie you know the smell of that.  If you talk about some of the sounds--sights you know the real thing that I know that I'm in southern soil is I'm on southern soil and when I see that red clay.  Now that is the sight.  There's no question about it.  That red clay and you know the only other place I've seen that clay is in Africa--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --that's the only other place I've seen it no question about it.  Yeah but when I see that red clay I said hey I'm home (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah so that's--what that's sights, sounds and smells you know.  I think we've kind of answered those questions then (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 296803
Speaker 1: How about now if we go back to that discussion of your days at Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].  Okay, now how did you choose that university?
Speaker 2: I got an athletic scholarship there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was a football player and I got an athletic scholarship there and at that time, Florida A&M, Southern University [Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], Grambling [College; Grambling State University, Grambling, Louisiana] had the top school for football teams in the country there's no question about that.  All of these schools now where you see the Big Ten [Conference] was the first to start the integrating of their teams and all of that and now everybody you see, everybody who wants to win has all these black players.  Well when I went to school, schools like Southern, Grambling and Florida A&M and Tennessee State [University, Nashville, Tennessee], those, that's--they got all of the best black players in the country.  All of them were there.  There's no question about it you know.  They they couldn't go to the University of Florida [Gainesville, Florida], they couldn't go to Florida State [University, Tallahassee, Florida] so they were all right there at Florida A&M and I mean they had many, many players there's no question about it and some helluva teams--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --too no question about it.  And then the other thing is that they had a very top music department.  So I played football, which everyone thought was an anomaly, and I went to school on a football scholarship and I majored in music which to this day I don't know anyone else who has done that but I did do that and graduated from there with a degree in music yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay so you were studying music formally beginning at age eleven and just continuing through the college years?
Speaker 2: I was hitting and missing at age eleven.  You know basically hitting and missing, studying books, and that kind of thing, picking up information you know here and there and all of that. As I said my father [Simuel Logan] was not a trained musician, he was you know an ear man.  He just picked up an instrument and he could sing and he was a very musical person but he didn't know a helluva lot about the theory of the music.  He could, he could teach me about reading.  He knew how to read and so that's, it was a lot of hitting and missing no question yeah you know.  So my formal music education really started at, at seventeen when I went to college yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you continue with the trumpet at Florida A&M?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.  That was my performing instrument and I continued to play until I got to graduate school and then I started being quite involved in writing and I stopped playing.
Story_ID: 296804
Speaker 1: So was there a break between Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida]--A&M and the graduate school?
Speaker 2: I taught at Florida A&M the year after I graduated.  I taught there for a year then I went to graduate school and then I taught public school for a year and then I went back to graduate school again and after finishing graduate school I've just been on various college campuses since then.
Speaker 1: So where did you go for your master's degree?
Speaker 2: Southern Illinois [University, Carbondale, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And American Conservatory [of Music] in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: All right.  So the--that's, is that an M.A. in music?
Speaker 2: M.M.
Speaker 1: M.M.
Speaker 2: Masters in Music (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  At Southern Illinois University?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you mentioned another school as well.
Speaker 2: American Conservatory.  Actually I started my graduate studies at American Conservatory in Chicago.
Speaker 1: But the degree was earned at Southern Illinois?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You said you taught public school.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: At what institution was that?
Speaker 2: Rudyard, Michigan.  That's a little community outside of Sault Ste. Marie [Michigan] in the UP, Upper Peninsula [Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay and that was for a year also?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me about that experience?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was wild (laughter).  It was as cold as all get outs.  It was so cold you had to have an engine heater to warm the water and circulate the water in your car and you had to go out several times during the day and crank your car up because it was that cold all the time yeah.  And I had cars break down and frozen head, frostbites oh hey. And then when by spring these mosquitos came out that were about an inch long and huge mosquitos and those things came out and they were biting my son [Wendell Logan, Jr.].  I had a kid then.  They were biting my son.  He had these mosquito bites all over him so I say we got to leave here.  I said there's nothing up here for us.  And so I went in and tendered my resignation.  The guy said well you know I can sue you.  I said you go right ahead.  I don't have anything for you to get.  So you go right ahead and sue me.  So, I kind of broke that contract after eight months.  I was supposed to be there for nine months.  I said hey I can't take it anymore.  Got to leave from here.  It was just out in the, out in nowhere.  There's a, a Kincheloe Air Force Base [Michigan] up there, there was at that time.  I think they're closed.  It was a site base, a Strategic Air Command.  And there were these huge bombers, these 352 bombers that would just would leave from there all the time you know.  And so I taught a lot of those kids.  A lot of those kids came into town I taught them, yeah.  One of the advantages of doing that was that we had everything that you could possibly want to work with because the government pumped a lot of money into that school.  Because you know the kids of service men were attending there and so it was, it, it was a very rich experience in that way.  And a lot of the kids you know you never know when kids were gonna leave.  You have a concert coming up you might have an oboe player whose playing in this piece and all of that and they're gone because their parents have been transferred.  You know there was a lot of that, a lot of turnover all the time you know.  So it was an experience.  Yeah it was, it was, it was you know an experience.  And so I left there and then prepared to go to graduate school at University of Iowa [Iowa City, Iowa].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what year is that when you're teaching at the military school or the school near the base (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was a public school near the base.  That had to be '60 [1960], '63 [1963] perhaps, '63 [1963], '64 [1964].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Somewhere in there.
Story_ID: 296805
Speaker 1: And you mentioned that you had a little son--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --covered in mosquito bites.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So how'd you come to have this family by '63 [1963]?
Speaker 2: Oh my wife and I had--we married in undergraduate school [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].  My wife and I have been married, she was eighteen and I was twenty-one.  So we were married when we were in undergraduate school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And have been married for forty-three years this, this past May 26.
Speaker 1: Sure.  And what's your wife's name?
Speaker 2: Betty, B-E-T-T-Y-E [Bettye Reese Logan].
Speaker 1: All right.  Now is that your only son.  The little ones (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  I have one son, one daughter yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what are their names please?
Speaker 2: His name is Wendell Junior [Wendell Logan, Jr.] and my daughter's name is Felicia [Logan].  And I have four grandchildren.
Speaker 1: Oh my.  Would you like to state their names for the record as well?
Speaker 2: Oh, one is Trey.  I guess you can probably understand why.  He's Wendell [Logan III], poor kid, Wendell the third I guess yeah.  There's one named Leo [Logan] and another named Reese [Logan].  The oldest, Trey, is what twenty, twenty-one years old and I have a granddaughter who is ten who lives with us yeah.  So.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did you mention her name?
Speaker 2: No, she told me I just talked to her on the phone and she said make sure you mention my name.  Her name is Kawren [Scott], K-A-W-R-E-N you know.  She's quite a kid.
Story_ID: 296806
Speaker 1: So we got to the early 1960s and around 1963, and, and then you mentioned Iowa [University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa].  So that's where you went to earn your Ph.D.?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay and again how did you decide on that institution?
Speaker 2: They gave me money.  That's exactly how that happened.  See when I--when you are married as I was and you know my father [Simuel Logan] told me he said well we help you to go to undergraduate school [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] and we figure that your graduate school was up to you.  I said okay fine.  And so I'll do it and I did it.  Well don't you need help?  You're crazy, you're gonna--by that time we had two kids [Wendell Logan, Jr. and Felicia Logan].  He said well you're crazy to be going to school like that.  I said that's all right, we'll make it.  But anyway to answer your question, Iowa gave me more money than University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] and University of Illinois [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois] did and I went to University of Iowa strictly because it was a monetary thing and I knew that they had a good music program there too.  Because I had friends who had gone there and so they spoke very highly of it and I went there.  [HistoryMaker] Olly Wilson was a friend of mine and he was there and [HistoryMaker] T.J. Anderson finished there and he's also a friend of mine you know so they spoke highly of the place.  So I--you know I went.  But that was, it was, it was mostly a business decision.  Where you can get the bucks [dollars] from and they gave me a teaching assistantship and that's how I got through school yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay so how long did you study there at Iowa?
Speaker 2: I was there in residence from '65 [1965] through '67 [1967] and I got the degree in '68 [1968].
Story_ID: 296807
Speaker 1: Did you continue to teach there after you finished the course work [at University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa]--
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: --and the writing?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.  I left Iowa and I went to Southern Illinois [University, Carbondale, Illinois].  Sorry I went to Ball State [University, Muncie, Indiana].  I'm sorry I taught at Ball State, I was there for two and a half years.
Speaker 1: Now Ball State's in Indiana?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Muncie [Indiana].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Is that a positive experience?
Speaker 2: Mostly.  As long as you are on campus and there were some--Indiana is a very conservative place.  You know, it was you know it was, it was what it was.  I would say yeah mostly a positive experience.  A lot of the people that I worked with made it so and then there were others who were just you know rednecks.  But there were enough people who I worked with that made it so and they were very welcoming and nurturing and all so yeah I would say mostly positive experience as long as you were affiliated with the school.  Outside of that it was you know mostly negative.
Speaker 1: So were you a member of the tenure track faculty there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And teaching--.
Speaker 2: I was teaching theory composition.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, that's what I taught.  I was a member of the music theory composition staff and those were the courses that I taught which is what my training was, in theory composition yeah.
Speaker 1: Was it difficult to make that transition from performing on the trumpet to basically becoming a composer of music that others probably would perform?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was making that transition because I used to play the instrument on a pretty high level and then I turned out that I couldn't play it.  All this here problems and all of that and so that was a heck of a transition and, and I guess one of the things is that when you know that you have done something and you been able to do it well and then all of a sudden for no reason it seems you can't do it anymore.  But as they say brass instruments are like girlfriends.  If you don't, if you don't spend time with them they'll leave (laughter).  That's a real sexist thing I guess (laughter).  So yes.
Speaker 1: Okay that's an interesting way to look at it I suppose.  So after she left you began to compose?
Speaker 2: After it left.
Speaker 1: Were you composing primarily for the trumpet or for orchestra?
Speaker 2: No.  All kinds of music you know, whatever, woodwind quintets you know bands, all kinds of, all kinds of musics, whatever the, you know whatever the occasion required that's what you know that's what I was writing.
Story_ID: 296808
Speaker 1: What was your doctoral project [at the University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa]?
Speaker 2: I wrote a piece for orchestra, and it was called 'Polyphony 1, for Orchestra' and that was, that was what that was, big orchestral piece.
Speaker 1: In what genre?  Just classical, jazz influenced?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was strictly, strictly classical, avant-garde.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: One of your favorite pieces?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: No, not you know, not any more.  I don't, I don't write that kind of music any more you know so it's not one of my favorite pieces no.  (Unclear).  It was what it was at the time and it was what I needed to do to get a degree (laughter), so that was what I did.
Story_ID: 296809
Speaker 1: Well at that point in, in the development of your career, were there any special mentors that you had identified, any styles that you were really drawn to as a composer?
Speaker 2: There were mentors.  There were you know the composition teacher I had.  One of the things that in terms of my composition teachers, I had a guy named Will Gay Bache [ph.], he was a Dutch, a Dutch extraction and he was a very modernist in his thinking.  He wrote electronic music and he wrote other kinds of music and all.  And the way it came about my teachers is that they left me alone.  And I always wondered about that.  They, they didn't, they didn't try to guide me a lot you know.  They just basically left me alone and I appreciated that very much.  You know they didn't try to--that was why I left American Conservatory [of Music, Chicago, Illinois] incidentally because they have a very prescribed type of curriculum, you have to do this, you have to do this and you have to do this and this style and that style.  And I said naw you know I'm not interested in that kind of program.  So you know most of the teachers left me alone and I'm very appreciative of them for that.  I had one teacher named Herley--Richard Hervig, who was a very fine man and that he understood my financial plight and he made, he, he made work for me, found jobs for me in the summer and all of that you know very, very, very nice man and very, very nice wife.  His whole family was you know like that very, very, very nice people.  I remember he told me one day he said you know you have a very rich musical tradition and you should consider using that.  He said no more than that.  And you know it took me a few years to to really hear what he had said but I finally said you know damn he's right.  And I--that's what I'm gonna do and I, and I, and I did.  I started looking at you know where I come from, the music that I really liked and I was influenced by.  How do you combine these traditions?  How do you take that music and lump it with something else and come up with something that, that's you that expresses something about you yeah.  And I don't know if that makes sense but that's, that's the best that I can say you know it's, it's, it's that thing--it's like taking what people some people would call it untutored music or the old old traditions the way I like to look at it.  The black old tradition and how do you take that and you mix it with what we know as a Western European tradition or orchestral writing or vocal writing and all of that.  And you can come up with some, some very interesting kinds of things you know.  Because you know that's for me that's that's what America is you know.  I mean it seems to me that if you are writing something else then there's something that's false, something that you know you would--any way, I don't know if I'm making myself clear at all.  I probably sound like an idiot but the thing is that I don't think that you can live on this soil and experience certain kinds of things and not be affected by them.  This is basically what I'm saying, and I think if you let the truth speak then that's what, what you are gonna write about.  It seems the thing to think if you're not doing that then it's something that's false and imposed and I'm not about that (laughter).
Story_ID: 296810
Speaker 1: Professor Logan [HistoryMaker Wendell Logan] you mentioned just a little while ago that Richard Hervig was someone who suggested to you that you draw on your rich musical background as inspiration for your new compositions.  Okay and can you tell me how you went about combining the various musical influences and what the product was in those early days.
Speaker 2: I don't even know how I go about combining but you know it sometimes it's sometimes its quoting; it's, it's a quotational kind of thing where you quote the rhythmic outline or the melodic outline of, of a pre-existing kind of melody.  Be it a spiritual or the blues you know.  Sometimes it's about that.  Sometimes it's not that, but you write something and in the, in the style of you know in the style of something that is pre-existing.  So you know it takes on very (unclear) it's done in various ways.  And then sometimes you look at various kinds of texts and look at what those things suggest to you.  A favorite poet of mine is Robert Hayden and I'm always, I read a lot of poetry but Robert Hayden, Robert Hayden's poetry says a lot to me because it's, it's so well-crafted and he says a lot of things that are not so obvious.  And he was a man who would really criticized during his time for not being black enough.  And if you read that poetry yeah and you'll say hey man you know this guy was talking about, man he chronicles the black experience you know.  But it's just not obvious and it's not angry in many, in many ways you know but it's very, very well-crafted.  And another person that, whose poetry turns me on is a guy by the name of M.B. Tolson [Melvin B. Tolson], T-O-L-S-O-N and I look at a lot of stuff that he was writing prior to E.E. Cummings.  There were a lot of things that he was doing you know but sometimes you look at the things that people like that have written and has a lot of information there as to--they suggest a lot of things.  There's a lot of musical stuff there in terms of pacing, in terms of imagery, in terms of suggestions for sounds and all that yeah so these are some of the ways that I, I've been able to you know combine some things and then there's some things that's just out and out jazz you know, just the blues you just pull them out and hey I'm not afraid to go there at all either you know and so you, you go there you know there's some of the things that they're about the dance, dance steps and all of that you know and I'm not afraid to go there in terms of in terms of doing things yeah.  You know the year before during my real younger days there were some of the things you know so I know that's too obvious to go there and all of that.  You know you're writing all this erudite music and nobody was listening (laughter) you know (laughter) except your friends you know.  Oh yeah, that's real I know.  And I said well you know the things that I don't have anything to prove to anybody.  I know I can write music and I know I can write at a high level and the only thing that I can do is to just try to express myself the best way I know how and have some fun doing this.  So, that's what I try to do you know.  However it comes out you know it's, it's about me you know that's what it's about and the black experience, something from experience.
Story_ID: 296811
Speaker 1: Well now you're here in the conservatory--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and you're not afraid of blues and jazz.
Speaker 2: Unh-uh, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Now has it always been easy to be, to be that bold as a composer to put--
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: --blues and jazz--
Speaker 2: Unh-uh, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: --out there for conservatory students--
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: --to perform?  Or was that a challenge to get blues in the conservatory?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah well that's another story (laughter).
Speaker 1: I'd like to hear that story.
Speaker 2: See you asked me, you're asking me two things.  On the one hand you're asking is something about style and then on the other hand you're asking me about getting something into the conservatory which is taught in my curriculum.  So which of those do you want me to talk about?
Speaker 1: Well both actually.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Well one at a time.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, no in terms of from a stylistic point of view no I, I as I said before I simply made up my mind that I was gonna write the truest music that I could write okay and you let the chips fall where they may.  If somebody likes it fine, if they don't like it fine.  That's that's good too but I was always want to write the most true expression that I possibly could okay.  So no that was not hard to do.  I made my mind up a long time ago that that's what I was gonna do and so you did--so I went there.  From the curriculum standpoint, I was brought here by a guy by the name of Emil Danenberg who was then the dean of the conservatory [Oberlin Conservatory of Music, Oberlin, Ohio].  He later became the president of Oberlin College [Oberlin, Ohio] and died in office as the president.  But Emil gave me a call when I was in a school called Western Illinois University [Macomb, Illinois] and he asked me if I wanted to come out here and, and develop a program in the African American music.  So I said well, what does African American music entail?  What are you talking about?  He said well it's kind of open ended you know that's kind of up to you.  So I came out and all of these people sitting around in his office.  Two or three were asleep I always will remember that.  While we were talking to me asked me what did you have in mind?  So I told him what I had in mind in terms of developing a program and he agreed and said all of that's possible.  I came here and it was not possible.  I mean I--they wanted me out the door.  They wanted--the attitude was get that damn music out of here and get your black ass out too.  That was the attitude okay, pardon my French, but you know that was the attitude.  And so you know it was a very hostile environment and that's you know--but I'm one of those types of people you know that I go into a hostile environment like that I sometimes will take the challenge and that's what I did.  I took the challenge and now I was looking here a few minutes ago here is one of the stands here.  I don't know if you notice this but you have, you're using some of these stands here, music stands that is to black out here.  But one of those says jazz studies.  It says several say conservatory.  One of them says jazz studies.  That didn't exist when I came here.  Now--I was just, I saw that a few minutes ago and I kind of chuckled.  So you hear this music being played all around here in the conservatory now and it's no big deal you know.  It, it--everybody doesn't accept it but so what.  It's being played.  The, the kids who want to play it are playing it.  They're playing at a very high level.  We have a very good faculty here.  There are nine of us, full and part time people.  About four of us are tenured.  Let me get that right.  I don't wanna lie.  One, two, three, yeah four, four of us are tenured, out of the nine.  And so that's where we have come.  We have a department now.  It's a recognized department in the conservatory.  So that's where we have come in terms of that.  So in the short, in a short span of time that's--hopefully that answers your question.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Now so who wanted you out?  Is it the students who were complaining or your colleagues?
Speaker 2: No.  Some of them, some of them colleagues, colleagues I mean come on Oberlin Conservatory for all these years, it's been here since 1833 [sic. 1865] it's--it was all about Western European classical music, that's what, that was it.  That was the forte of his place and that was the sacrilege to bring this kind of music in and say that you're gonna study this kind of music and all of that you know and yeah.  So there were a whole lot of colleagues, there are still colleagues who don't think that we should be here, but we're here.  You know I mean they're, they're not going to be fools and they're not gonna be overt in terms of their expressions of discontent but we know that--we know who they are and they know who they are you know.  And so you know we don't worry about them.  They--we just go ahead about our business of educating the students you know.  That's what we do.

Speaker 1: You said there's a jazz studies department within the conservatory [Oberlin Conservatory of Music, Oberlin, Ohio].  So that's part of your--that was part of your vision for the African American studies program in music.  What else would you include in addition to jazz in that definition of African American--?
Speaker 2: Well I have a course called Introduction to the African American Music and it starts off with West African music okay looking at the music of West Africa and its relationship to the American tradition, okay.  And I, I--the course starts with that.  It starts with all of the pre-blues forms, the hollers and all that kind of thing.  It goes into blues, it goes into the music we develop in the city.  I go through--you know they go through jazz, we touch upon gospel music.  And there is talk about composers who were writing country music.  That's non-jazz you know.  People like Hale Smith, [HistoryMaker] Olly Wilson, [HistoryMaker] T.J. Anderson and, and, and a host of other people (cough).  So that's, that's the, that's the coverage of the, of the course.
Story_ID: 296813
Speaker 1: I know you said you start your lectures in this course on African American music [at Oberlin Conservatory of Music, Oberlin, Ohio]--.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, you said?
Speaker 1: The course that you teach on African American music--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --you start in West Africa--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and go through various musical styles.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But again I'm just curious what is it to you mind that makes black music black?
Speaker 2: Well, just like--let's take, let's take the black off of it--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know 'cause I'm not sure I can answer that.  But there is a music that was created by African exiles.  No question about that.  They had a music tradition that they brought with them and a lot of the features of African American music are extensions of that tradition.  When we start talking about things like you know the metronomic sense of, of the music, time line based music, that kind of thing.  The whole thing of called response.  And remember these are--they're artists' kinds of things we're talking about.  You know those, those things are very obvious.  So there are some very obvious ways that that black people created music because of their culture and because of the needs of their culture and all that.  There's, there's a, a certain kind of sacred music that, that they create for us.  I mean if you look at the spirituals and all, those are not based on white hymns.  You know that's original music of African exiles, that's what they are you know.  You are not; you cannot go to any spirit--or any white religious music and find the kind of words that you're going to find in those spirituals and all that.  I mean why would someone, why would a, a European be singing 'Sometimes I Feel Like A Motherless Child' for instance.  Yeah, I mean I don't understand it.  Why would you be singing that?  As as Judge Carlin [ph.] said the other day, he said you know, he said the house of blues these places should be bombed and all of that.  There are abominations and all.  He said you got these people up there call themselves singing the blues and all that.  You know how you gonna sing the blues if you've never had it.  It was about--you, you get people up there who drew up a pretty good imitation and all of that but they don't, they don't understand where the music is coming from and why you know the music is being sung you know.  And they don't understand that deep, that deep wellspring in terms of what all of this stuff is coming from.  So I probably haven't answered--haven't said anything that's intelligent there.  But you know I'd like to take, I like to take the word black a lot of times off of the music.  I understand the need for it and my title here is actually professor of African American music.  So I don't have any problem using black or anything about that at all because there is a type of music that black people created and still continue to create.  There's no question about it.  But in the following analysis what we're talking about is human expression.  What it means to be human on the planet at a certain time.  That's basically as musicians, as artists, that's all we're called upon to do.  That is tell some story about what it means to be human on this planet in a certain place at a certain time.  You know that's all Mozart's [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart] music is about.  That's all Beethoven's [Ludwig van Beethoven] music is about.  And it should not be studied because it's any better than Howlin' Wolf or is any better than Robert Junior Lockwood [HistoryMaker Robert Lockwood, Jr.].  It, it you know, if all it says is that hey this is what it meant to be human at a certain time and at a certain place, that's, that's when you start looking at human expression like that because that's all we were talking about human expression which is something bigger than color you know.  You talking about something much bigger than that.  So am I making any sense (laughter)?
Speaker 1: You're making perfect sense--
Story_ID: 296814
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But I have a specific question--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --about one of your compositions I heard in recent years.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It's at Cleveland [Ohio] at the Trinity Cathedral, Episcopal church [Trinity Cathedral, Cleveland, Ohio] near the university [Cleveland State University, Cleveland, Ohio] there, downtown. I think it was 2002 or thereby.
Speaker 2: Langston Hughes Centennial.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what I'm thinking of.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah 'Ask Your Mama.'
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now there was a lot going on there.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I don't know if that was black music, jazz, sacred music, but it was in a church so I mean what is that?  What was the inspiration for that?
Speaker 2: Langston Hughes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: His poem 'Ask Your Mama[: Twelve Moods for Jazz]' and you know the--well you know this so we're just doing this in terms of conversation for this particular event, but the thing is that you're well--I mean you do know this you do know the poem 'Ask Your Mama' and in the margins it specifies certain types of musics and certain things that will be played.  And he--there's a theme that he gives you at the beginning of it, at the beginning of the poem and all this.  So it's a very reasonable thing.  I came across it many years ago.  In fact there's an original copy, there's an original copy in the library here and I told him I said you know this shouldn't be in the shelves, it should be wherever you people keep only copies of things and all, but I had it my hand several times.  I said man, this is, that must have been twenty years ago.  I was looking at that I said man this really resonates to me and but I didn't do anything with it.  And later on I know a friend of mine did a piece, Harold Smith did a piece on that text 'Ask Your Mama' and I said this is kind of nice but I hear some other stuff going on.  And so I decided Langston Hughes Centennial.  I said all right and I got a commission from Tri-C [Cuyahoga Community College, Cleveland, Ohio] to write this piece and they said well what is it gonna be?  And I said I have no idea.  They said so what's his name Terry [ph.] said well maybe you could do something combine (unclear).  And I listened to her and I just started laughing, chuckle to myself and after a while it came to me and said you know 'Ask Your Mama,' Langston Hughes, this is his centennial.  And I said um-hum that's what I'm gonna do.  I'm gonna do this piece.  And I told her I said it's gonna be 'Ask Your Mama,' it's gonna be for choir and perhaps orchestra and it's gonna be for big band and all of that.  Well it didn't turn out to be choir and didn't turn--except the band scenes so there's a part in the way and it didn't, it didn't require an orchestra needing strings as I had originally envisioned for various reasons.  I knew that that was going to be very difficult in terms of getting players and won't go through the litany of reasons why I didn't decide to use the strings and all yeah but there's a lot going on there.  There's a lot in that poem that suggests various types of musics and the, the, the poem is a kind of chronicle of the life of black folks really.  Well the black folks certainly at the turn of the century, it's a kind of chronicle in a way in terms of so you got everything in that from a kind of field hollers up to modern--I mean avant-garde jazz some of the stuff that might, might sound like Ornette Coleman or whomever but you got, you got a lot going on in the piece because the poem requires that you know.
Speaker 1: I think I heard folks playing the dozens too (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, some of that's there, sure.  That's when he started talking about 'Ask Your Mama.'  There's a whole bunch of dozens they didn't (laughter)--you know 'Ask Your Mama' yeah the whole thing could be considered to be a play on the dozens yeah.
Speaker 1: Well as I recall that piece was very well received in Cleveland--
Story_ID: 296815
Speaker 1: --Wonder about some of your recent compositions.  Do you care even what audiences say (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --about your music?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh yeah.  At one while I didn't but yeah, I, I certainly do.  I want to communicate with people and I want the people to have an experience.  Be it positive or negative, I want them to have some type of experience.  And you know I--if it makes them angry I want them to be real angry no question about it.  If it makes them joyful I want them to be real joyful.  Yeah so, yeah I'm, I'm always trying to communicate with people there's no question about that.  Yeah that's what my you know that's what I attempt to do with every piece.  And most of my music have--recent musics have been well received.  Most of the audience understands something about you know where I'm coming from and all.  I don't know but it kind of strikes a chord with them and the thing is that you don't have to dumb down in terms of your writing to people. I mean it doesn't have to be so obvious as a lot of rap is for instance.  Not that I have anything against rap and all that because but some of it is so obvious you know and and well let's leave it there.  You know you don't have to just be so obvious.
Speaker 1: Okay. So again it appears that you've found receptive audiences--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --here in Ohio.
Speaker 2: Not only Ohio.
Speaker 1: Yeah I wanted to ask about other places where you've had an opportunity--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --to hear your music performed?
Speaker 2: I heard my music performed in New York City [New York, New York], Lincoln Center [for the Performing Arts, New York, New York], Town Hall [The Town Hall, New York, New York].  It's been well received and well-reviewed.  It's been performed in Chicago [Illinois].  It's been performed in places out of the country.  It's been performed at San Francisco [California], a number of performances there.  So yeah it's been, it's been around.  It's been performed down South. I've had,you know, Dallas Symphony's [Dallas Symphony Orchestra] has done my stuff.  On the other hand (unclear) Savannah Symphony [Savannah Symphony Orchestra] has done my stuff.  I had a piece that was a real avant-garde piece based on Robert--a poem by Robert Hayden called 'Runagate Runagate.'  And we did it in Savannah, Georgia, and it was overwhelming success and the piece is, is very modern but the people understood what the text was saying and what the music was saying.  They got the message there was no question about it you know.  And I'm saying it to say Savannah because you don't normally think of a southern city although they think their (unclear) as being very sophisticated.  A lot of these people who came along who attended that program were not very sophisticated listeners to be sure.  I, I know that.  But they got the message in terms of the piece as much as the people in Dallas [Texas] and New York did or San Francisco [California] for that matter, so yeah.  I have been lucky enough to have you know music played in a lot of places you know.  In very urbane kind of places and in places where people are not so sophisticated but they all, they all get the message in terms of you know what the music speaks to them on some level and that's all that you can ask yeah.
Speaker 1: Are you composing a lot of commission work at this point in your career?
Speaker 2: Right now I'm not doing anything.  I, you know it's, it's--let me explain that.  I am, I have just finished a commission that for the San Francisco Chamber Players and I'm in the process of copying it.  So because of various illnesses I have been out of commission in terms of writing.  For the last four to five years I have had various illnesses that have been, very serious, and they have taken me away from writing.  Not in terms of my head and all stuff goes through my head but when I wrote 'Ask Your Mama' that piece that you heard, I was ill.  Yeah there was some question about whether that piece was gonna be finished.  I mean I, I was very ill.  And it amazes me that the piece was completed. I got a lot of projects, you know, I'm, I'm working on and will be working on, yeah you know, but they are mostly commissions yes as you said yeah.
Story_ID: 296816
Speaker 1: I'm wondering as a professor of African American music here [Oberlin Conservatory for Music, Oberlin, Ohio] on almost on Lake Erie, on America's north coast.  You have to come to Cleveland [Ohio] to be right there--
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: --but I'm wondering have you had an opportunity either to travel to Africa--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --to compose music there or--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --to hear your works performed?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I do all of that.
Speaker 1: Okay well tell me about some of your experiences in Africa and the audience, working with audiences there.
Speaker 2: Well the audience there--it was not a concert situation.  We--I mean not a classical kind of concert. It was a jazz group at a festival there, and some of my arrangements and all are played you know on that, on that festival.  The people--of the people, those who understood it there and those who didn't, didn't in the sense they--it was--they didn't hate it but you could tell it was something that was strange to some of the ears.  There's no question about that.  It was strange to some ears and we went over there and with a couple of R&B groups, [The] S.O.S. Band so we were on the same bill as they were, who obviously those groups were a hit, much more than we were.  But you know that's okay, we went there and we played.  But the experience was that we met people like Fela Ransome-Kuti [Fela Kuti], visited his shrine and I played with some of his musicians and all.  So it was a very rich experience.  Now they got it.  They knew exactly what we were doing and they wanted to do that too.  So what we were doing there's no question about it so but it was, it was quite an experience going to you know his shrine and to meet such a political person you know who has been jailed many times.  They burned his place down many times just because of some of the statements that he made about the government.  Whoever was involved at the time you know.  So it was a very rich experience no question about that you know.
Speaker 1: So did you tour various countries in Africa?
Speaker 2: Yes it was Nigeria.
Speaker 1: Mostly Nigeria.
Speaker 2: I've been to Brazil and we toured various states there.  We went all over the country.  That was a, a, a United States Information Agency yeah, we went on a tour with them and we were there for weeks and we went all around the country.  That was quite an experience to explore all of the musics around places like Rio [de Janeiro, Brazil].  We played there Bahia [Brazil], other places.  We played all over the country.
Story_ID: 296817
Speaker 1: Well it seems that you've done so much in not a lot of years.  Let's see you're about sixty-five years old--.
Speaker 2: You almost got it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah okay, but I'm wondering if you're, if you set other goals for yourself.  Things that you haven't done yet but you'd like to complete soon?
Speaker 2: Well right now I'm just trying to get as healthy as I possibly can and, and I hate to think--talk about it but obviously something you have to think about retiring and I don't plan to do this for the rest of my life that's for sure and I don't plan to die with my boots on as it were.  So yeah I, I want to retire some place and watch my granddaughter [Kawren Scott] grow up and write some more music.  That's--those are the goals that I have and helping kids you know.  I think that there is a lot that we can do in terms of helping kids and they really--there's no question about it.  I mean they--particularly in terms of the black community, they need our help.  I was passing by here today and I saw all of these kids out there choir students and all of that Oberlin Choristers, students and all of that.  I looked over there and I see this sea, this sea of faces over there and eventually I don't see any black kids there.  We have a, a, a music program here that's connected with the conservatory [Oberlin Conservatory of Music, Oberlin, Ohio].  It's a pre-music, what is it, it's an early music program let's put it that way, that's not what it's called at all.  It's a community music program for kids coming in taking beginning piano, violin and all that kind of thing.  My granddaughter studies piano.  Yeah she studies violin with a private teacher too.  But the main thing I'm saying is this is that there are no black kids who, who are studying this music you know.  Even little place like this which is a population that's almost fifty percent African American and they're not for whatever reasons not taking advantage of, of what's offered here.
Story_ID: 296727
Speaker 1: Professor Logan [HistoryMaker Wendell Logan], at the end of the last segment you had just started to talk about educating young people and mentioned the Oberlin Choristers, the outreach program here at the conservatory [Oberlin Conservatory of Music, Oberlin, Ohio].
Speaker 2: Yeah, well the Choristers is--it doesn't--that's not affiliated with the conservatory I was just merely using that as an example to make a point--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and that I looked over there and saw all of these kids and I saw no black kids really over there and, and they probably had one or two you know but I mean to be sure but that was my point.  My point being that a lot of black kids are not studying the arts for whatever reason.  Some of it has to do with money to buy paid lessons.  You know that's expensive pay for lessons.  Then there's seemingly, there is not the interest that there once was in terms of you know studying the arts and all you know.  It used to be so that all little you might say middle class girls played piano.  They had some piano lessons.  They might stop at some point but you know black or white they studied that instrument you know.  Well that doesn't happen anymore. The fact that people are not studying the, the keyboard and certainly black people aren't as they did at one time at all.  So as I say less seemingly and a lack of, of interest in terms of, in terms of the art and on the other hand you got these programs that have been cut from the school.  They're just not there anymore.  I mean we, we studied music in the school and the school furnished instruments and all that's where you got them.  That's not there anymore except you know like the places like Cleveland School for the Arts [Cleveland School of the Arts, Cleveland, Ohio], for instance.  You know but and which that seems a school that I, I really think that some things are going on there, very positive things that are going on there.  Well, I think I know some very positive things going on there.  I've heard, I've heard the choir.  We've had them down here and Mr. Woods [William B. Woods] does a very fine job with those kids there's no question about that which shows what can be done with kids.  I knew that all these things were possible because I played with bands, I've heard bands.  I've heard some very good ones and they're mainly you know just high school kids, grade school kids, there's no question about that yeah.  But I just think that there is just not the awareness perhaps that there once was on, on, on the arts and the importance of the study of the arts.  Not in the sense that all these kids wanted to be artists you know musicians and all that but how the arts can help prepare kids for other things you know.  One of the things in terms of learning that instrument you gotta have is discipline.  You got to sit there and spend some time doing it.  And certainly it seems we have some say in things you do in terms of you know the studies you gonna learn something about math, you gotta be able to sit there and you got to have the discipline to sit there and do that kind of thing.
Story_ID: 296728
Speaker 1: Well Professor Logan [HistoryMaker Wendell Logan] you mentioned that the 'Ask Your Mama' piece was commissioned by Tri-C, Cuyahoga Community College [Cleveland, Ohio], their jazz fest [Tri-C JazzFest], great educational program.  I think more than a quarter of a century now--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yes.
Speaker 1: --they've been doing that--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --and that you've had some contacts with folks in the school of the arts [Cleveland School of the Arts, Cleveland, Ohio]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in Cleveland [Ohio]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and I wonder do you have other opportunities to work in a setting that might expose younger students, pre-college age students to, to jazz and the other music that you propose?
Speaker 2: No.  Unfortunately we don't--I tell you what we try to do.  Well this year we did go out and play for a high school.  We were invited to play for a high school.  In (unclear) we got those invitations and we played for these schools and I--I'll carry (unclear) on them then I'll play for these kids.  Now that's done for several reasons you know.  It's done so that these kids can be--can hear some of, some other kids and maybe they might be interested in attending Oberlin [Conservatory of Music, Oberlin, Ohio].  That's one of reasons you know for doing it.  So that's one of the things that we do.  We might consider to do some type of outreach.  On the other hand on sabbaticals I'll have--I'll have spent down south because I had gone down there to study their culture and one of the things I did when I was in Savannah [Georgia], I, I contacted one--I knew one of the band directors in one of the schools and I met him some place and I told him I was in the area.  I'd be glad to come over and do some workshops with these kids.  And now in doing so I was able to recruit a trombonist from there, who has graduated just a year or so ago and is now in graduate school at Queens College [Queens, New York] in New York City [New York, New York].  So yeah there are various reasons why we do these kinds of outreach. One of them is to you know certainly have contact with, with kids to help them along and the other thing is to recruit them for our program here.  And so we've been able to do that through outreach and we have a group that goes out on tour.  They went to Chicago [Illinois] and went out to Aspen [Colorado].  They played in Kansas City [Missouri] in places this past winter too.  And we're gonna send that group down south to play this coming winter too, and that's to let people know that hey we're here and let's use as a vehicle for recruitment too.  So for me that's the kind of outreach you know I normally think of that as mainly an outreach kind of activity.
Story_ID: 296729
Speaker 1: May I ask about your work among the Gullah people?  And was that South Carolina, Georgia or--?
Speaker 2: Both, mainly in Georgia.  I was in Brunswick [Georgia] and then I was in Savannah [Georgia].  And one of my former students used to always be telling me about you know these Geechees and all that.  I said yeah man I know I went to school with them boom, boom, boom all of that.  Not a lot of them but his mother used to teach, or used--his mother was a teacher and she taught all on Daufuskie [Island, South Carolina] and Sapelo [Island, Georgia] and he was telling me about these places and then you have to get a boat to go there you know. And so I went--I'll tell you what really happened.  I--they have in Atlanta [Georgia], they have the National Black Arts Festival, it's biennial.  I got a chance to participate on that several, several times and I was down there one year and I heard these McIntosh County Shouters and they were doing the winning shout. And I went up and the guy's name who was leading was a guy by the name of Mr. MacGuyver [ph.].  So I went up to Mr. MacGuyver and I said, "So hey where are you from?"  And he told me.  And he told me where you know--where he was from and that they do the shouts and they shout the new year in and he told me enough so I knew that when I went down there I knew where to find him.  And I did find him.  And I got a chance to my wife [Bettye Reese Logan] and we invited some friends from New York City [New York, New York].  We came down and we went to the shout.  Shouted the new year in and all.  It was quite an experience no question about that.  And so I got a chance to meet some people from South Carolina as well as, as well as Georgia.  I was looking for a musical residuals and all of that.  That's, that was not as easy to find as one might have expected.  But anyway I got some music out of it and I did another early commission for Tri-C [Cuyahoga Community College, Cleveland, Ohio] in which the piece I wrote was called 'Gullah Island Suite' and it was for a jazz group and it was played on the Tri-C Fest [Tri-C JazzFest].  It was done what's the name of that big Baptist church over there it was on Euclid [Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio]?
Speaker 1: Euclid?
Speaker 2: It was on Euclid.  That big, they have a lot of concerts there.  It's on Euclid.  What's the name of that big church there?
Speaker 1: Is it near downtown?
Speaker 2: Not far.  It was downtown.  I'll think of it in a minute.
Speaker 1: Liberty Hill?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Is that a Baptist church?
Speaker 1: There is a Liberty Hill Baptist Church [Cleveland, Ohio] on Euclid.  Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah that's it.
Speaker 1: Near the Cleveland Clinic [Cleveland, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, that's it.  It used to be a Jewish synagogue (unclear), yeah, yeah, but it's a Baptist church now right, yeah, yeah, but yeah that's where we were performed it.
Story_ID: 296730
Speaker 1: This art form the shout, okay, and I have a Baptist background and shouting for me means something I think other than what it means among the Gullah people if you invite other people in to watch you shout.  So can you just help some of the people who might watch this tape visualize you know what this shouting is all about?
Speaker 2: Well, it's considered to be a sacred dance.  I think they had steps and they had various kinds of rhythms.  They have a guy who sets the rhythm with a stick and he does it with a wooden board on the--there's a rhythm that might go shoop, shoop, shoop, doo, doo, shoop, shoop, doo, doo that type of thing.  And the people do you know they do these steps and is considered to be a religious dance and it remains so as long as you don't cross your legs okay.  And the people that, that there's this group it was not the McIntosh Shouters [McIntosh County Shouters], but it was that group and a lot of other people.  And they simply just shout the, the new year in.  There is a lot of food.  People prepare food, mainly seafood, fresh fish and that type of thing, crab and all and there's a lot of eating and people just shout the new year in and that's basically what it was.  In fact I filmed, I was able to film with a lot of difficulty, the shouting.  I was able to do that when there was a guy--a lady was giving me a hard time about filming it and the guy came up and he saw what was happening and he said no let him have it.  So I want him to have it and I was able to tape you know one of the, one of the shouts there yeah.
Speaker 1: So this is a late night community music festival or dance festival?
Speaker 2: Well I tell you it starts, you shout the new year in. So it starts at the church.  You go to the church, there is a sermon, okay.  And just before twelve o'clock, people break, they go over to the praise office which is next door, the shout house and all that.  People been in there cooking while service is going on.  They go there and music starts, people begin to shout and they shout all the way into the wee, wee hours of the morning, two and three o'clock in the morning.  There are people that you know shout a new year, "It's a new year and I ain't gone, it's a new year and I ain't gone."  That's the kind of stuff but those were some of, some of the tunes that were sung in you know in all.
Speaker 1: Now I've read about ring shouts, 19th century accounts--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --to slave spirituals, some jubilee songs.  Now are they shouting still--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in the 20th century, when you were down there?  Are they shouting to spirituals or these new compositions?
Speaker 2: No, those were old compositions.  There's no question about that.  The old, old compositions with biblical kind of references.  No question about that yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 296731
Speaker 1: So how do you take that inspiration and then put it into the 'Gullah Island Suite'?  Is that for instruments only--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --or are there dancers as well?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh, instruments only.  It's something about the--I didn't do the quotations from--that's not true.  There's some of the, some of those stick patterns that the guy did, I did use there's no question about that.  But in terms of melodies, no I didn't quote anything.  The original melodies but they were inspired by that type of music.  Once you put a certain kind of rhythm on you know you come up with various kinds of melodies.  That's what happened in this case, yeah.
Speaker 1: And do you think that's evidence of African survivals in American music?
Speaker 2: Absolutely--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --yeah.  The whole time line thing shoop, shoop, shoop, shoop, shoop, shoop, shoop, yeah that whole timeline idea.  There's no question about where that came from yeah.  That normally would have been a bell kind of pattern in West Africa yeah, but it's been shifted to something else but it's the same you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that was your sabbatical year among the Gullah?
Speaker 2: That was one of them.
Speaker 1: That was one of them?  Okay.
Speaker 2: One of them yeah.
Speaker 1: All right and I'm wondering--.
Speaker 2: I spent two down there actually.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: One year I was in Brunswick [Georgia], that's the first time and the second time I was in Savannah [Georgia].  Yeah so actually I've spent two, two sabbaticals now.
Story_ID: 296732
Speaker 1: Do you feel that you were able to take your professor's advice and put it to good use in drawing on your musical peers?
Speaker 2: Oh absolutely, absolutely yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there other works that (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There wasn't really--we were just talking and you know it really wasn't given as I had given you some advice you know.  We were just talking as well as a lot of the ways that we talk.  It was not as teacher to student but it was just talking.  A lot of times my composition lessons were in a bar, they were--that's where we go and drink a pitcher of beer and that's, that would be the composition lesson-we'd be talking--and so it was in that spirit you know of not hey I'm giving you some advice but it was just a conversation and I, I, I heard what he was saying you know.  I paid some attention to what he was saying.
Speaker 1: And that's Professor Hervig [Richard Hervig]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --again who gave you that advice?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: At the bar and in other places?
Speaker 2: Or wherever you know but I'm saying some of the lessons were over a pitcher of beer, that's, that's what we did yeah.  I mean because come on you gotta Ph.D., these students now if he can't write (laughter) well you shouldn't have admitted him to the program, he or she--you understand what I'm saying.  I mean so basically hell if you know you bring 'em in you give 'em the test, you know what the hell they can do and you leave them alone and he did.  You know I didn't have to deal with a lot of those dumb courses.  He let me write various kinds of things.  He said hey he doesn't need that.  He knows how to do that but he, he was very astute in terms of that.  I will always appreciate him for that.  I was able to tailor my programs to basically you know, don't get me wrong now, I, I was busy.  I did stuff like studying computer language and all that you know.  There was nothing in the programs saying you, you were supposed to study Fortran [Formula Translation] and COBOL [Common Business Oriented Language] and all of that but that's what I ended up doing studying computer languages and all that kind of stuff.
Story_ID: 296733
Speaker 1: What do you think has been your greatest achievement as a composer?
Speaker 2: Oh, thank you for qualifying that.  I was gonna say my two kids [Wendell Logan, Jr. and Felicia Logan]--having two kids (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No that's fine too.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I, I don't have a greatest achievement, you know.  You're always striving for that.  I don't have no greatest achievement at all.  You know, you know everything you do you can find something that could have been done better in it.  So there is no greater achievement you know.  You're always striving to, striving to control the uncontrollable you know.  That's what art is, you know.  Ain't no answer.  You get there and you fashion someone you say oh okay and you go back and look at it and you say that is really some dumb stuff that you came up with and all that and sometimes you rip things up, you know.
Speaker 1: Is there anything of which you're especially proud, any of your compositions?
Speaker 2: Yeah some of them I'm proud of but I don't consider them as being you know--there's a piece called 'Wanna Be,' [ph.] there's 'Ask Your Mama.'  You know I guess the most recent thing that I'm working on is, is the piece that I'm proud of yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well musically speaking and you're proud of those compositions--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and the titles which you just mentioned--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --but now what is this about the family?  You're very proud of them as well?
Speaker 2: Well I see you say great achievement--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --I guess I consider the fact that I'm still married to the same lady [Bettye Reese Logan] who was eighteen years old, that's an achievement.  And I have two kids and four grandkids.  You know those are what I consider to be great achievements and I have been able to live long enough to see all of them you know and I hope to you know be around when all of them are finished school and that type of thing and have their kids and all that.  So you know that's, that's the kind of stuff I consider to be--when you get to be sixty-five years old that's when you began to look at the world I guess in a very, very different way.  So you know those are the, those are the achievements you know or just getting up being able to appreciate you know listen to the birds and listen to, not listen but take in all the smells around and see a great sunset you know.  Those are, those are what I consider to be you know achievements.  Because look here, I almost left here several times (laughter) so, so, so you know these, these are, these are the achievements you know just to get up one day and put a foot--one foot in front of the other you know.  That's, that's an achievement for me, great achievement.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My kids asked me how do you do it?  I said very well young man or young lady.  I said I got up this morning you know that's--and I feel very good, very fortunate to be here no question yeah.  So those are my great achievements.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 296734
Speaker 1: Well I know you said earlier that you don't intend to die with your boots on.
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: You're gonna retire perhaps one day and kick back and relax with no boots on, but at that point in time what do you hope your legacy will be to, to young musicians?
Speaker 2: I never thought of it.  I you know I just don't really, I don't really--I have come in contact with a lot of musicians in my year and a lot of them I'm, I'm still in touch with, follow their careers, they're doing fine.  By now they're bringing back kids and you know that's that's amazing and you know the main thing is that they are all good people you know.  Good musicians, but they're all very good people and so I had (unclear), excuse me, I don't know if I had anything to do with that but these are the things that we try to instill in them.  Some of them about you know the importance of family and, and you can be a musician, you can be very serious about your art, but also there is some other things around that are important too that you can't, that you can't, you can't forsake and all so you know I don't know I don't ever think about any of these legacy and all of that.  I just hope that you know they'll continue to be as serious about the music as I was--I am and they will be as serious as possible about doing--trying to make this a better place.  Trying to make it wherever you are a little bit better than it was when you got here.  And I think you know you can't hope for any more than that you know just trying to make it a little bit better than it was when you got there and I think it's--I have done that and I'm not patting myself on the back in terms of that.  I have had the opportunity to do that and for which I was very thankful for.
Speaker 1: And you did a new thing here.  At the invitation of someone [Emil Danenberg] at Oberlin [Conservatory of Music, Oberlin, Ohio], you started the African American music program and now you're the tenured professor--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --of African American music.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But I have been for thirty years, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, but that's a new thing, you know.  That position didn't exist right when you came?
Speaker 2: No it certainly didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay and now it's permanent (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And it probably won't exist after I leave (laughter).
Story_ID: 296735
Speaker 1: For the next generation--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --of musicians in the academy, what do you think the challenges will be for them?
Speaker 2: Just to work, to find a job.  You see America is not about art right now.  We're at one of those very strange periods now.  America is not about art.  There's no question about it you know.  America could give less about art you know I mean they don't--the country does not support it.  I mean you can easily starve.  I mean they're just not, the jobs that there once were in terms of music and all. And so this country is about, we are a lot of valid (unclear) chasers, that's, that's, that's, that's you know that's who we are.  You got people you know (unclear) that are out chasing the dollar and you know that's it.  It's about chasing the dollar and buying these things whatever the hell they are you know.  But it's not--it's not about you know it's not about art, there's no question about that.  I mean any type of art whether you talk visual arts or music or you know just, just you know we're a society that doesn't read--you start talking about poetry and all of that and you go out and ask kids well hey do you know a poem?  No.  Are you interested in knowing one?  No.  I mean they got some of the rappers who they call poets and all that but I mean you know, you know I, I, I was going there with an open mind and I listen to it and I guess they support you there.  But when I start thinking about people like Robert Hayden and M.B. Tolson [Melvin B. Tolson], Langston Hughes, people like that no, no.  Don't tell me these kids are poets you know.  I'm sorry.  You know we've got a hell of a tradition they doing there and, and if they are poets then who are those people?  You know what I mean.  So I'm saying all this to say what?  If you know, if I've done anything I at least I have opened up the possibility.  Yeah, here's one thing.  When I came here you could not come into the conservatory [Oberlin Conservatory of Music, Oberlin, Ohio] and say that you wanna major in jazz.  You could not do it.  That was only one type of audition here.  You audition in terms of classical music and if you didn't, if you couldn't major up in terms of that un-un you could not come into the conservatory.  That's changed you know.  If you say I want to major in jazz studies now, that's what you audition in.  You don't come in and audition and then play a Beethoven [Ludwig van Beethoven] or Mozart [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart].  We want to hear what you can do in terms of some jazz stuff and this is how you get in so.  So yeah, if no more than that if you start talking about a legacy it's allowing kids who have the desire to come here and study.  There is the opportunity for them to do so and yeah, hey I, I won't take credit for anything else other than that yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I've had you know a little something to do with that yeah.
Speaker 1: So that's your legacy then to students coming to the conservatory.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 296736
Speaker 1: Do you have a legacy or a wish or a hope for African Americans in general, especially young people?
Speaker 2: I just hope, wish that kids would simply take or avail themselves of the opportunities that are around.  I mentioned to you a few minutes ago about this course we have a community music school program around yeah.  These kids could be studying and you know taking--they could be, for some reason they are not here.  Somebody needs to answer that question.  The ministers are not doing it you know.  They're telling them about being saved you know.  But I you know I'm here trying to deal with some existence right now and they're not dealing with these issues you know.  Why are these kids being miseducated you know?  What are you doing about the miseducation of these kids?  When are you gonna get angry enough that you'll say our kids are not going to be miseducated anymore.  I mean when is that going to become whatever that call for a fight you know.  When, when there is sometimes when your back is against the wall and you say no I ain't gonna move you know what I mean.  So in other words when are we going to say enough is enough, you know?  You know everybody that the Lord puts down here has got the same amount of intelligence.  You're not gonna tell me that some people are put here they are smarter than others okay.  We don't need a God who is gonna be putting some of us down here who's smarter than everybody else okay.  Don't hand me that kind of stuff okay.  So the thing is that what are we gonna as a community? What is necessary to ensure that our kids are doing the same damn thing or benefitting from this society as everybody else is yeah?  We have given a lot to this society much more than it's given us.  There's no question about it.  And when are we going to simply say hey, enough is enough and now it is time for us to get up for our dues to be paid okay.  So this is what I wish to happen.  And you might consider that to be both as polemical as hell I don't care how it sounds, but that's, that's what you know, you know enough, I wouldn't say any more.
Story_ID: 296737
Speaker 1: With all the questions that I've asked (laughter), I guess my last one would be since we're in a conservatory [Oberlin Conservatory of Music, Oberlin, Ohio], would you like to sing or play something while the camera is still rolling?
Speaker 2: Oh no.  I, I wouldn't want to now honestly no one wants to hear my singing and nobody wants to hear my, my playing either.  No I wouldn't, I wouldn't bore people with that kind of thing.  I've got recordings around and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --people will listen to some of that stuff that's documented there.
Speaker 1: Or if you'd like to mention some titles from CDs maybe and we can go out and do some listening.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well there is a CD of the Oberlin jazz faculty in which I am performing on.  I mention that because that's the first and only CD that we have as a faculty.  Then there are all of the recordings I have oh I don't know there must be over fifteen or twenty recorded.  I'd have to get you know a list.  I'm not saying that boastfully but I'd have to you know go and get the list in terms of you know, in terms of pieces like 'Runagate, Runagate'.  One of the pieces like 'Moments.'  I'm trying to think of other things that I recorded.  Well 'Runagatee' has a chamber of original (unclear) has an orchestra version.  'Ask Your Mama' is still a recording but it's not on a commercial recording.  That was performed here at Oberlin too and we were--in fact it was broadcast.  It was live but it was a broadcast back then with CPN [Creative People's Network] so you know I can always get a list too of things that have been recorded but nothing comes to you know, nothing comes to my mind except those pieces 'Runagate' both the chamber and orchestra version and 'Moments.'  I'm trying to think of what else.  I got a number of other pieces that I recorded.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So we can check at a record or a CD store.  Who sells records anymore?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right CDs.  These were CDs I was thinking about.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I do have a couple of records but these are CDs yeah.  Finding them might be, might be a problem.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: CRI [Composers Recordings, Inc.] for most of recordings, somebody has taken that book over because they have gone out of business but those recordings are still available somewhere composers recordings.  I'm trying to think of some of the others--yeah but there are things that, things that you know are available.  If I have some in my office I'll even give you a couple of the things we've done here with the Oberlin Jazz Ensemble.  In fact, we just recorded a CD about three weeks ago.  We were in the studio recording a CD.
Story_ID: 296738
Speaker 1: And Professor Logan [HistoryMaker Wendell Logan] I know we can read about your work in [HistoryMaker] Samuel Floyd's 'The Power of Black Music[: Interpreting Its History from Africa to the United States'].  Would we find information also in biographical dictionaries of American musicians and--.
Speaker 2: There's a very good, fine book. Sam Floyd was responsible for that too is called 'Biographical Dictionary of African American Composers' [sic. 'International Dictionary of Black Composers,' ed. Samuel A. Floyd, Jr.], which is in a couple of volumes, very thick volumes and the articles there were very well written.  They were written by musicians and that should be in most libraries no question about that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's a good source.  Eileen Southern has a book, 'Biographical Dictionary of African American Composers' ['Biographical Dictionary of Afro-American and African Musicians'] and there's another book by a lady by the name of Alice Tichener [ph.] where she talks about some number of African American composers and I'm in that book where she discusses several of my works here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So there's yeah you know there's various sources of my pieces.
Speaker 1: Well I thank you for the interview--
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: --and for the discography and the abbreviated version and, and last but not least the bibliography of materials about African American musicians in general and especially where we can do more reading about your life story.  So thank you on behalf of The HistoryMakers.
Speaker 2: Well thank you, thank you very much.
