Speaker 1: We have a few questions that we want to ask you that we call our People Magazine questions to get us started.  What's your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue.
Speaker 1: Oh, well.
Speaker 2: Without thinking, I can tell you that.
Speaker 1: You're surrounded by it today.  I think Matthew [Hickey] knew that.  What's your favorite food?
Speaker 2: That's a good question, because I have several favorite foods.  I love collard greens, I love sweet potato pie, I love--oh my--green vegetables in general.
Speaker 1: Oh, great.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And when you get ready to vacation, where would you like for that to happen?
Speaker 2: Well, we just came back from France, specifically, Paris, but I think the Islands of the Sea would be my favorite location spot.  And we have been to the Mediterranean, which is very nice, in specifically Israel and Africa, but I think I like the islands.
Speaker 1: That's great.  What is your favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Well, it's taken from the Bible.  The Book of Proverbs, the third chapter verses five through six.  It says "Trust in the Lord with all your heart, lean not unto your own understanding.  In all your ways acknowledge him and he shall direct your paths."
Story_ID: 70047
Speaker 1: Okay, let us try and get acquainted with your ancestry, and let's start and work back.  We'll start with your parents.  Give me your mother's name and spell it and her birth place then your father's name?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Pearlie, P-E-A-R-L-I-E, Mae, M-A-E, Soles, of course, is her married name, S-O-L-E-S, but her maiden name's Bishop, B-I-S-H-O-P.  And my father was Henry Soles, Sr.  And they both were born in Alabama, as was I.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What part of Alabama?
Speaker 2: For me?
Speaker 1: For your parents?
Speaker 2: My mother was born in Tuscaloosa, my father was born, I believe, near Selma, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Your mother was Tuscaloosa?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Your father near Selma?
Speaker 2: I believe that's--it's somewhere near--in that area.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where were you born?
Speaker 2: Anniston, Alabama.
Speaker 1: How far is that from?
Speaker 2: Anniston is sixty miles from Birmingham [Alabama] and approximately [eighty-eighty] miles from Atlanta, Georgia.  It's an [U.S.] Army town.  It--growing up there we saw people from all over the United States because they were there as part of the Army.  And it's also a WAC [Women's Army Corps] training center and during the recent Olympics, my wife's cousin, who is a Salt Lake City [Utah] policeman, went down there to train for, you know, for terrorist types of things.
Speaker 1: Okay, and siblings, name them, in order?
Speaker 2: My sister, her name is Annie Pearl Bownes, B-O-W-N-E-S.
Speaker 1: She's the oldest?
Speaker 2: She's the oldest, right.  And I have a brother, his name is Roger Andrew Soles, S-O-L-E-S, of course.  And those are the only two brothers or sisters that I have.
Speaker 1: Oh, and you're in the middle?
Speaker 2: I'm the middle child.  I get the brunt.
Speaker 1: Or you're the buffer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Your grandparents' names and birth place?
Speaker 2: Okay.  My mother's mother is Mary Allen [Bishop].  I don't know where she was born, but she was born in Alabama, I mean the specific town.  And my grandfather, I don't know.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: I don't know his name.  You know that's interesting because all the time that my mother and I were talking about the, you know, grandparents, I guess, I just lost the--his name, I really don't know.
Speaker 1: Did you ever meet your granddad?
Speaker 2: No.  Oh no, they died well before I was born.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: I guess that's one of the reasons why--
Speaker 1: Very young.
Speaker 2: --Yes, right.  I met my father's mother, Joanna Soles, J-O-A-N-N-A, Soles.  She was a mid-wife, she brought me into the world.
Speaker 1: Oh, wow.
Speaker 2: So there was that obvious special relationship there.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So how old were you when Joanna Soles died?
Speaker 2: Oh, you know, I don't remember.  I was small, very small, very small.
Speaker 1: But you remember her?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, definitely.  Yeah, that was Grandma Soles and Grandma Mary Allen, I don't remember, she was--she died before I was born.
Story_ID: 70048
Speaker 1: Did you ever hear any stories about either of your grandparents?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  My mother's [Pearlie Mae Soles] mother, Mary Allen, was a very devout woman of God, and part of a larger family that I'm very familiar with today, which is interesting because, even though I never met her, her part of the family, I do know and have met, and in fact, her relatives, I found one here in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Oh, wow.
Speaker 2: Yes.  In fact it's a gentleman that--where we have our bible study, Mr. Owens, that's on my mother's side of the family.  And Mr. Owens owned a taxi company in Tuscaloosa [Alabama], and he married my mother's aunt and then out of that union became Henry Owens who then fathered William Owens who is my cousin, I guess, a second or third cousin, I guess you would say.
Speaker 1: That's amazing.
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh, and very business-minded.  And Mr. William Owens, my--I guess my cousin, he was a chiropractor in Chicago and a benefactor to Florida A&M [FAMU, Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] because he had graduated from that school.  So that part of the family, my mother's side I'm familiar with 'cause I met them.
Speaker 1: They all came from Joanna Soles?
Speaker 2: No.  This is--this is my mother from Allen's side of the family.
Speaker 1: Oh, from your--
Speaker 2: My mother's side, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, your mother's family tree?
Speaker 2: Right.  I should have said Mary Allen Bishop, who's my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And Owens came from that--your connection to Owens?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it came from the Allen side of the family.  Allen, Aunt Vandelia(ph.) Allen married a Mr. Owens.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  I'll get it straight after a while.
Speaker 1: That's interesting that you were working with family today.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And the irony of that, I had been here in Chicago a number of years and a lady said to me, I'd like for you to meet this young man and so she introduced us, and in discussing some things with him, I said, I have some Owens in my family.  And I said--he said where were they from?  I said Tuscaloosa, Alabama.  And I said he owned a taxi company and I said we called his wife Aunt Vandelia.  He said that's my grandmother.  I said, oh my.  And we lived only what, about four blocks from one another and didn't know each other in the same town.  And that was just amazing how God orchestrated that.  And then once I found that out and then of course I began to find other relatives that were related to them and so you have the tree.  It came from the Allen side of the family and hey, and I'm very happy about that.  And then my mother found her--her aunt who was here in Chicago also.  So it was really, really a beautiful experience for me.
Story_ID: 70049
Speaker 1: Growing up what kind of stories did you hear about your ancestors?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Even grandmother, great-grandmother.  You know from that story?
Speaker 2: Yes, there are some stories.  But before I say that on my father's [Henry Soles, Sr.] side of the family, I can remember quite vividly my Uncle Willie because Willie Soles was a piano player.  And as a little boy I used to watch him play the piano and I would copy him.  And that's how I learned how to play the piano, from Willie Soles, my uncle.  Another uncle on the Soles side of the family was a gentleman who owned some land in central Alabama and there was a dispute over some land between him and the neighbors who happened to be white.  And they lynched him, they killed him, they were sympathizers of the [Ku Klux] Klan.  And of course these--this was related to me as a little boy that my uncle had been killed by people who were Klan sympathizers.  And of course as a little boy, you know, you're just wondering, you feel very frightened this could happen.  And I remember specifically as I was growing up in Anniston [Alabama] the back of the bus experience where we would pay like in the front and sometimes--then we would walk--get off the bus and go around to the back door to go in, not going through, but going outside, I said, why do we do this, you know.  And those were the customs of the times, it was a separation of the races.  And if you wanted to try on any clothes at one of the local stores, you couldn't do that, or the movie theaters, you had to go to the side entrances, you couldn't go the front.  So in other words what was being communicated to us was that you're second-class citizens, you do not have the rights and the privileges of the white members of this city and state, because as you know the south was segregated.  And--but one thing I remember always that mom [Pearlie Mae Soles] and dad always tried to make us feel as if we were somebody in spite of the segregation that we were experiencing, that we're somebody and that our relatives were people who were upstanding, substantial people, God-fearing people of the land, raised their own food and--so that instilled in me a desire that even though I was considered second-class by the majority of the group, I still was somebody because my parents said I was.  That's very significant to me.  And instead of sending me to the local public school they sent me to a Lutheran private school, which gave me a religious foundation at the same time.  Now, of course, in the South, if you acted up in school, you know the teacher would come up (hitting his hand) and give you a little beating, I mean, today that's considered abuse, but that's what they did, the switch and that was good discipline.  And then if you did that then mama heard about it, you get another when you get home.  Or if the neighbors saw you doing something you shouldn't do, hey.  So that was allowed then, but it didn't hurt me.  In fact, it gave me the discipline and the solid foundation that I needed.  And there was a little church from where we lived and there was a lady there and she told my mother, your son is going to be a minister.  And of course, you know, I didn't even know what that was really, but she was right.  And I remember the neighbors and how we interacted with them.
Story_ID: 70050
Speaker 1: What kind of child were you growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, it's hard to just capsulize in one sentence.  But I was always very curious.  I always wanted to know things and why things happened.  Now this is the Alabama phase of my life because I saw around me different things, different people, and I was always asking questions so much so my father [Henry Soles, Sr.] say, "Boy, shut your mouth, mind your manners."  And I didn't know what manners meant.  But I was always asking questions.  And then--I can--my mind goes back now, and I can remember scenes in the town that--where I was born [Anniston, Alabama].  And just--it--it--I remember we had these hills and it had this clay dirt and sometimes people would take the clay dirt and eat it, yes.  I said hmmmm, that's interesting, so I tried some of it too.  Alabama is known for that.  But now that's the--I remember the phase because after we left Alabama, we moved to New Jersey.
Story_ID: 70051
Speaker 1: But when you were growing up in Alabama, what kind of relationship did you have with your sisters and brothers?
Speaker 2: Well my brother was not--was not born at the time.
Speaker 1: Oh, so you left before the--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Baby was born?
Speaker 2: Right. And my sister of course was you know, she was like the other mother, either you know, the older sister you know.  She was responsible for carrying me to this place and that place and doing things.  And if she wanted to date one of the soldiers, mother [Pearlie Mae Soles] says, "Take Junior along."  So Junior had to go.  That was part of the growing up phase.
Speaker 1: Junior got a lot of goodies (unclear).
Speaker 2: But Junior would tell everything, everything, but that's really bad (making sounds talking to mama).  That was her way of making sure that my sister didn't get in trouble.
Speaker 1: How old were you when you left Alabama?
Speaker 2: Oh, I would say about eight or nine, something like that, yeah.
Story_ID: 70052
Speaker 1: What kind of relationship stands out for you, what experience stands out for you in your relationship with your mother [Pearlie Mae Soles]?
Speaker 2: My mother is a loving, caring type of person.  And I could always depend upon my mother to be there for me, you know.  Mother always made us feel very special.  She was the type of person had a heart to help other people and in growing up, she would even have a--bring in foster children to stay in the home.  She was that type of person, and despite the fact that when she was growing up, she had a form of tuberculosis that almost took her life away, but the people in her community were praying for her and she overcame that and--I'm moving ahead now, my mother lived eighty-six years.  And one phase of her life she had colon cancer.  The doctor said she would not survive.  She was in her early sixties then.  And we prayed and I was living here in Illinois, she was in New Jersey, and went back home after people prayed and of this--and she survived, that the doctors were amazed, she lived twenty, what twenty-six years beyond that, and they were amazed, when we knew it was a miracle, yes, yes.  So just kind of had to move ahead to let you know.  But my mother was marvelous, yes, woman.
Speaker 1: Did she work--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --Outside the home?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Mother worked outside the home, did housework and in the later phase, and when we came to New Jersey she worked for a printing company and always very industrious, yes.  Very--she had an eighth grade education, but she--the type of person who was beyond the eighth grade in her understanding and her industriousness and really full of life.
Speaker 1: She had the intellectual capacity beyond eighth grade.
Speaker 2: Definitely.  And as the French would say, she had that "joie de vivre" that zest for life, that love of life, yes.
Speaker 1: And what the old folks say, "mother wit".
Speaker 2: "Mother wit," exactly.
Story_ID: 70053
Speaker 1: Now my father [Henry Soles, Sr.] had to have it 'cause my father did not have--he had very little education.  He couldn't read or write because he grew up in the cotton fields of Alabama and they were not allowed to go to school.  The whole thing was to keep you, you know, dumb so you won't know anything.  So he couldn't read or write but he was able to get around, yes.
Speaker 2: What kind of relationship did you have with your dad?
Speaker 1: Well Daddy was, you know, as a little boy you look up at Daddy, you know, take me this place, take me that place, and Daddy would do that.  Of course you see Daddy didn't have the educational capacity that some others had, but Daddy was very loving and caring too.  And he made sure that I--he kept me in line.  Now when mother want to give me a little spanking, Daddy would say, oh, don't--Pearlie Mae [Soles], leave the boy alone.
Speaker 2: (Unclear)
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.  Yes. So, but you know, and I miss my father, you know, because as a boy, you know, your father's the one who becomes a role model for you.  And I had cousins--I had cousins around too.
Speaker 2: Did he live as long as your mom?
Speaker 1: No he didn't.  Daddy died when he was in his 60s, yes.
Story_ID: 70054
Speaker 1: And what was the reason for the family's move to New Jersey?
Speaker 2: Well, a cousin of ours told us about an opportunity in New Jersey that we could come up there and do some farming in one of the areas, and there were some people from that area who had moved to New Jersey that our cousin knew.  So we said, well, this is an opportunity to go north where we would be able to be out from under segregation and get a chance to get some education.  And so my parents were certainly open to that.  And so we left Alabama and moved to, a town, it's about twenty-five miles from New York City [New York].  And it was, like they had these truck farms, and that's where we stayed for a while.  And we only knew the people that we--that brought us and their friends that came up from Alabama.  So coming up--was a different world for us.
Speaker 1: And you were about eight or nine then?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Story_ID: 70055
Speaker 1: Well, before we talk about the New Jersey segment, let me ask you, what was elementary school like for you, because you moved to New Jersey about eight or nine?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So you had the elementary school (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Right I was in New Jersey, yes.  You mean in Alabama or--
Speaker 1: Well, you started school in Alabama?
Speaker 2: Yes, I went to school--
Speaker 1: What was that school experience like?
Speaker 2: --Well, it was, it was a good exper--
Speaker 1: What was the name of the school?
Speaker 2: --I don't remember the name.  All I know it was a Lutheran school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the--you know, it was very structured, it gave me an opportunity to be disciplined, you know.  Then they taught you catechism and they taught you the basics, reading and writing and arithmetic.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  But it was very good experience as opposed to public schools, which of course was completely different.  And that's why mom [Pearlie Mae Soles] and dad [Henry Soles, Sr.] wanted me to go there.  So it really gave me a kind of head start and they taught you.
Story_ID: 70056
Speaker 1: Okay, so when you got to New Jersey and this is kind of an urban or suburban school--
Speaker 2: Suburban, yeah.
Speaker 1: --How was that different for you?
Speaker 2: Suburban experience.  First of all coming from the South and having a very thick southern accent, and the kids, of course, are gonna tease you, talking like "thaaat huh".  You know laughing that leads to you know fights it leads to--you feeling almost inferior too because of the fact that you don't talk like they talk.  And they think you're stupid because you're from the South.  And to add insult to injury, the teacher, I mean the school said that because I was from the South, specifically, the Deep South, Alabama, that the school system was not on the same level as the school systems in New Jersey.  Therefore they would have to put me back a grade.  And then they said that is not sufficient, we're going to put you in a special school, because we feel--well, they didn't say it this way, but this is what its interpretation is--that you don't have the capacity to learn like kids that are born here, because you come from this inferior environment.  Of course my parents were very upset.  They didn't believe that.  I had a cousin who certainly didn't believe it.  And he was always teaching me or trying to get--enlighten me about African American History.  See I've been exposed to African American History at an early age.  And it's something welled up in me to say, they're saying that I am not good enough, that somehow I'm stupid or whatever.  I don't believe that.  And my parents didn't believe it.  So there was a teacher, her name was Mrs. Switzgable.  Mrs. Switzgable said Henry does not belong in this special school, and he does not belong in a category of being, you know, like a grade behind.  So she said over the summer I'm just gonna do some tutoring.  And she did.  And when I went back to school, I went from the fourth grade to the sixth grade, the grade that I should have been in.  And I never looked back.  But she had the faith in me to believe that I could do the work, but the school system said no, you can't do the work.  So we had competing analyses here, so thank God that she won out, yes.  Otherwise I could have been just kept back, and perhaps--
Speaker 1: Branded?
Speaker 2: --Yes branded.  And unfortunately that happens to a number of children even those that are born in the urban or suburban environment, they just discard you if you don't learn at the same rate as some other students.
Speaker 1: And her name was--how do you spell her name?
Speaker 2: Switzgable?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: S-W-I-T-Z-G-A-B-L-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So she was very important.
Speaker 2: Yes, she was.  As well as another teacher that I encountered in the sixth grade, Mrs. Link, L-I-N-K.  Mrs. Link was the type of teacher who was hard-nose.  And even though you got an A, she wanted an A plus.  She was very specific about that.  And the reason she did it--it's because the school that I attended is called the Bryant School, it's no longer there, they tore it down, unfortunately.  There were--there were blacks, Italians and Jews.  We were the working class.  Now the school that we would have gone to for the seventh grade was in the upper middle class area of the town that was frequented by the children of Wall Street executives.  I mean, they lived in what we called Sleepy Hollow, huge homes overlooking everybody else.  But this school was a middle school and we had to go there from our working class environment to this, you know culture elite.  So that's why Mrs. Link was the way she was.  She was preparing us for that cultural shock.  And once we got there, after going through her rigor--rigorous you know curriculum, we were able to compete on equal footing.  And I think many of those kids were amazed because I mean some of them had gone or would have gone to private schools.  But the middle school was a very good one and so their parents sent them there.  And we were able to--'cause she prepared us very well.
Story_ID: 70057
Speaker 1: In what city was this in?
Speaker 2: Plainfield, New Jersey, P-L-A-I-N-F-I-E-L-D.  Plainfield produced in 1953 a gentleman who was the Decathlon Olympic champion.  His name is Milton Campbell.  And in fact he was a grade ahead of me because in high school I was in track and field, I was on the student council and I won what was a novelty then.  They had what they called the student Mayor of Plainfield for a day, and I was that student mayor.  You know, of course I--you know I'm supposed to be stupid based upon what they said before.  And I was also the representative to the county student council and graduated in the upper, I would say, let me see, I think it was in the ten percent--upper five percent of the graduating class of 400.
Speaker 1: So what were middle school years like then?
Speaker 2: Middle school the (unclear) school I was talking about, was interesting because, as I say, surrounded by these cultural elite kids and competing equally, academically, and of course athletically, you know, we do very well, I think they were amazed at the preparation that we had, and I was in various clubs, involved in even academic debates and things like that, student council.
Story_ID: 70058
Speaker 1: So in high school [Plainfield High School, Plainfield, New Jersey] you were very, very active.  You contended with the socioeconomic difference and all that that meant, but within that context you had 400.  Tell me about this great 400?
Speaker 2: Well, what we called a 400 were African Americans whose parents were middle class, and the children of these middle-class parents who were going to the school felt that they were better than the other blacks who were working-class parents.  So you had a dichotomy there because of social standing, in their minds at least.  So--but I was from the lower, middle, I mean the working class side, and what helped me was my academic and athletic abilities.  I was able to be president of this thing or president of that thing or you know student council and all of these other things I was involved in and graduated from the Spanish Club and I should say I was the president of the Spanish Club.  And there was some interesting things that happened too.  There were--they grouped students, they called them X--W, X, Y.  Now if you were a W student, say English that meant you were in the highest level of English.  X was the middle and Y was the low.  I was a W student in every subject that I was involved in, whether it was physics or Spanish or any other, algebra.  But when it came to English, I was considered a 3--I mean I was a X student.  Now, there was--that puzzled me, because if I could you know conjugate verbs in Spanish and all these other things, why--and write, why was I a X student.  What I found out was there was like an unwritten rule that African Americans were not going to be in the W English class.  That was reserved for Anglo students.  And so that, even in this northern context, there was this racist concept because it didn't follow if I were in all these other subjects, which were harder than English, so why wasn't I in English.  So we found that out. And then there was a group called the Key Club, which was an off shoot of the Kuwanis.  Now they had never had any black students involved, but they asked me to be part of that, and the reason was because they saw me as a leader and therefore that would make their image look good to have me as an African American.  I refused because I knew--I knew it was a game.  I--that's just the way I felt.  It was not anything to do with hatred, just simply I felt that you're using me, why couldn't others be involved who were equally qualified?  But so that civil rights part of me began to show itself in high school, yes.  And one thing we found out about the North.  In the South, racism was very blatant, you knew it.  In the North it was more subtle, and there were--there were--they talk about being equal, but there was not always this equality.  Not only as related to blacks but to Italians and other ethnic people, yeah.  So we--we felt that.
Story_ID: 70059
Speaker 1: So what was life like in--within the Soles' household?  Compare it for me from when you were in Alabama and then when you moved here [Plainfield, New Jersey]?  Just, what was day-to-day like?
Speaker 2: To begin with my mother [Pearlie Mae Soles] who had done house work in Alabama now was doing work in a printing company and also another company used to call American Rockwool(ph) and a company called Cornell Dubilier, I can remember that.  That's factory work, she was doing that.  My father [Henry Soles, Sr.] worked in the steel company and--so again these are working-class types of jobs.
Speaker 1: But those were good-paying jobs?
Speaker 2: Yes, comparatively speaking, they were.  But you know and mother and father did their best to keep the house together, in fact, so much so till we bought a home in another town.  But initially though it was not easy for us 'cause Daddy couldn't find a job and we had to go on temporary welfare.  And just because a person's on welfare doesn't mean that they are no good or that they're lazy or anything like that.  It's done to help many people tide over.  Of course today we have corporate welfare too.  But--so that's--so we lived in that context and even though we were religious people, there were times when we didn't go to church until this minister that worked in the same place my mother worked invited us, because the church--the churches that were in the neighborhood or even a little farther away, some of the people that went to those churches, they never invited us.  I guess they said well, these people, you know, they--they're low class, again, labeling okay.  But this minister then invited us to come.  And it was a very small church and it was very loving and that's where we started our church life.  And--
Speaker 1: What denomination was it?
Speaker 2: --It was a Baptist.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then as time went on, there was a lady who came to Plainfield [New Jersey], and my cousin, who had then moved from Alabama with us, this is another cousin, she went to the storefront church where there was, you know, it's a small congregation and you had to minister, but it was what people called a Sanctified Church, actually or Holiness Church.  More specifically today they're called Pentecostal churches.  And so, she brought me to this church and you know the people were exuberantly praising God, you know, and I had seen that in Alabama cause the lady who said I was gonna be a minister, that's the type of church she was at.  And--and they needed somebody to play, so--the piano, so my cousin said, "oh, my cousin can play the piano."  So I went up to the piano and tried it the best I could you know. And--
Story_ID: 70060
Speaker 1: But then at one point then I made a commitment to God, to Jesus Christ, I accepted him into my life.  But this was a woman minister who was the pastor and she was very affirming, she had a musical background too, but she's affirming to me and giving me the impetus just to go forward you know and to do what God wanted me to do and to get to my education and develop my leadership skills.  And that little church, that's where I guess the Henry Soles you see today was born because I had a new life in that little church.  It shall always be in my heart, yes.
Speaker 2: So, so now your religion, your spiritual side was maturing--
Speaker 1: Yes, and--
Speaker 2: --You were making a conscious choice--
Speaker 1: --Right.
Speaker 2: --Spiritually.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Tell us about that?
Speaker 1: I made a conscious choice.  Now the choice, the specific choice, did not happen at that church.  I have to put it this way.  This is where I became aware.  And one time the members of the church, we were visiting a church in Baltimore, Maryland, and there were several of us guys in the church--
Speaker 2: How old were you then?
Speaker 1: --I was a teenager.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I was--we were walking along on the streets in Baltimore and there was another gang of guys from local, you know, coming and wanting to confront us.  So you know we were able to deal with that and I came back into the church and that's when I gave my heart to [Jesus] Christ.  I heard this message, you know.  We were visiting a church, but heard the message and that's where I made my commitment.  And it was in Baltimore, Maryland.  And I came back to our home church and be--and I was just really on fire.  And I went back to school and told some friends what had happened you know and that's when I really got involved more into the clubs and like student council and things like that.  And so the guy that I says is the decathlon champion [Milt Campbell], he says--he says, man, you need to be a lawyer or preacher, said because you know how to speak.  Well, the latter was the case as the preacher became a preacher, but yes, that's a great experience for me.  Storefront churches you know have produced a number of great people because it's like a community of believers.
Speaker 2: Unity.
Speaker 1: Yes.  And they encourage one another, they--it's like an extended family.  So--
Speaker 2: So, essentially, when you got back home and back in your high school circles, you had, though you didn't know it, you had already started your ministry--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --But through all these high school activities?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Story_ID: 70061
Speaker 1: Is there anything about high school [Plainfield High School, Plainfield, New Jersey], your high school experiences other than those you've mentioned that stand out for you, any particular high school teachers or counselors?
Speaker 2: Well, we had, back in those days, of course they do not allow this now, we had what we called the Old Testament Club.  And the reason for that is that if you were a Christian or a Jew, you both could go to the Old Testament Club.  And they allowed it in that public school.  And I remember those interactions with one another and is very encouraging and uplifting.  I remember winning track meets and getting medals and all of those things that go along with athletics.  I remember, you know, certain families that I used to visit, we had fellowship times with the kids.  And again my mother [Pearlie Mae Soles] was taking in foster children.  She always opened her doors, my mother and father [Henry Soles, Sr.] did, you know.
Speaker 1: That's good. [OFF CAMERA-INTERRUPTION].
Speaker 2: Thanks.  So the Old Testament Club also was an extension of your--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --Of your continuing path toward the minister?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So I guess those stories out of the Old Testament really grabbed you back then?
Speaker 1: Yes, they certainly--and it meant a lot to me.  Of course you know the Old [Testament] and the New [Testament] have great stories and great inspiration.  I also remember of course going out on the street corners and speaking, you know.  And by then, see people used to think that I was kind of shy even though (unclear) I didn't say too much, you know, I was--but after that experience, bold.  You couldn't shut me up.
Speaker 2: They never thought that again.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 70062
Speaker 1: And it was just really dynamic, but it also whetted my appetite for the political aspect because being named Student Mayor of Plainfield [New Jersey] for a day whetted my appetite for you know government.  I could see government as a real tool to help people you know bring some quality to their lives if they use government in the proper way.
Speaker 2: What elements of government or politics kind of stand out for you--for you in that period, and how did you meld it into your day-to-day?
Speaker 1: Well, of course, the mayor had--in a town there was a strong mayor, weak council type of government.  So you saw the mayor as this figure who could make decisions that affected people, either positively or negatively.  And--and also I saw it as a way to help my people, the government could be that tool since there were, at that time, no blacks on the city council.  But I saw it as a way of being a way to help our people.
Speaker 2: This was early '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Yes.  And I--and it so it just really whetted appetite for me, and I have to jump ahead because what's later led to my becoming a journalist and I covered politics and education later on.
Story_ID: 70063
Speaker 1: So during those high school years, that's when the Selma, Montgomery march [1965] and all that was happening and of course you knew people in Alabama.  What was your take on--
Speaker 2: --You mean Selma and--
Speaker 1: Right
Speaker 2: --But actually--
Speaker 1: --The [Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] activity and all that?
Speaker 2: --Yes.  Actually, I was older.  Actually, I was older then.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was older then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, I will answer that question.  What King was doing, of course, I fully supported having been in Alabama and the segregation society.  Now I know that there were sit-ins in North Carolina and other places, but Alabama is different.  I think the blacks of Alabama will only take so much and then they have to express themselves.  See--you notice the people in Atlanta and all that, they did nothing, they just let it go.  Alabama, no, enough is enough.  And so what King did was not so much King as was the fact that Rosa Parks, you know, really said, I am tired of--and I'm tired--I'm not getting up from my seat.  And he was drafted into the movement.  And once he got into it, of course, he became the leader.  But it was her desire to not take any more abuse that started the Alabama phase of the Civil Rights movement.
Speaker 1: What kinds of stories from home, personal kinds of stories, as it relates to the Parks, the King movement, what were you hearing from people who were living closer to it every day, do you remember any of it?
Speaker 2: Well, I think people were supportive, but they didn't know whether it was going to do any good, that you know maybe he was out there and would lose his life and knowing the South that he was taking a great risk and so forth.  I think they supported what it was trying to do but, they weren't too sure if he'd be effective, and if the people will continue that maybe their spirits will be broken by the segregationist philosophies and the Bull Connors, etc.  So, you know, but the ones in the South though, I think they were really committed because, hey, we've had enough and we've got to do something about this.  And King was able to rally them.  But there were others before him though.  Let's not forget that, 'cause he came from a middle class black family, highly educated, came to a church in Alabama where a lot of the school teachers went.  So he was looking for a middle class church. That's what it was.  But the minister before him had a record too of being very civil rights oriented.  And--so he could have just stayed where he was, but Rosa Park, and that's why I always refer back to her, you see, 'cause--cause I was raised around a strong black woman and that's what she was, yes, and still is because she's still alive, yeah.
Story_ID: 70064
Speaker 1: So you got through, I would say a very good high school period?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was relatively a good high school period because I had--there were other people who were Christians like I was and you know we had a great time together, but I didn't just relate to only Christians, I was you know with the guys and it's you know normal--
Speaker 1: A fellow experience.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So you're ready to go off to college, what kind of thinking and planning did you do for that and what made you choose--what was your major and what made you choose it?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, you know, I won some scholarships to the school of my choice.  It happened to have been Rutgers University [New Brunswick, New Jersey].  But during that time I said, I need to be around home because I need to help my parents.  And I took the SAT, scored very high on that.  Here in Illinois you have ACT, which is similar.  And could have gone to Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] because all I had to do is take one more test 'cause Yale required one more.  But I says, naw, I don't want to go to Yale.  But it's a nice school, but at that time, I don't know what I was thinking about, but anyway, so I entered Rutgers University.  Really not as a--not as a full time student because I wanted to work and that's what I did, I worked and went to college for two years at Rutgers.  Then when the--the idea was that the ministry was foremost in my mind.
Speaker 1: You move over just a little bit.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, you went to Rutgers, decided you would major in--
Speaker 2: Well, at Rutgers I was majoring more or less in English.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  So you liked writing?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: You were going off in that direction?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Communications?
Speaker 2: Communications, that's it. That's it.
Speaker 1: Did you stay with that major?
Speaker 2: Well, while I was there.  I mean you had to take many courses, philosophy, you know, all this poli sci, political science and all that.  But see that's not really what grabbed me.  I was still thinking more in terms of the spiritual end.  See it just--your inner compulsion.
Story_ID: 70065
Speaker 1: So what I did, while I was working, I was working as an insurance agent.  Now that's a story in that because I went to get a job to sell for a big insurance company at that time because it was advertised, and I called on the phone and I went there and they says come on up.  I get there, "I'm sorry the job has been filled."  Okay, I go back I call again.  Oh, sure we have several jobs.  I knew.  I was black, simple.  And it hurts when you know that you're qualified to do something and somebody turns you down, on the basis of race.  You have to deal with it internally.  I suppose I could have gone and complained to the Civil Rights Commission or whatever.  I didn't do that.  But I still found a company that hired me.  And it was during that phase in my life working as an insurance agent and going to various homes and meeting different people that the desire to be a minister got stronger, so I entered school in New York, Manhattan Bible Institute [New York, New York], and started my studies and--for the ministry.  And also during that time, I--I worked for the American Bible Society and the New York Bible Society.  And it was at the New York Bible Society that I worked the 1964-65 New York World's Fair at the New York Bible Society Exhibit where we put together a handwritten bible. The then Governor [Nelson] Rockefeller wrote the first verse and then everybody else wrote a verse afterwards and we gave them a little plaque, well not a plaque, actually, it's just a little piece of paper that said you wrote such and such verse in the handwritten bible.  And then my Spanish was fluent 'cause you had to speak another language and otherwise you couldn't work in that pavilion because you had people coming in from all over the world and we had--so we wrote--it was 35 or 36,000 versus.  And I met people from every corner of the globe and that in itself is a very enriching experience, you know.  But again while I'm doing that, I'm going to school and--for the ministry and enjoying every moment of it, speaking all over the place, and it led to my being ordained, but in '63 [1963], I did March on Washington, or was it '68 [1968], '63 [1963], yeah, yeah, that's right.  I had to remember.  Yes, that was one of the most enriching experiences of my life.
Story_ID: 70066
Speaker 1: Tell me about it [March on Washington] from your point?
Speaker 2: When we entered Washington [D.C.], which is, I believe, not too far when you think from New Jersey to Washington, D.C. on the east coast, thousands of people, black, white, brown, people from all different backgrounds, it was a moving experience because to see all of us together there at the Lincoln Memorial.  But I remember seeing this guy standing up talking, racist philosophy.  His name is George Lincoln Rockwell.  He was a Nazi and the people ignored him, and they continued to walk on and march and standing there with people from all backgrounds and races and cultures and ethnic groups and to hear Mahalia Jackson sing "Precious Lord" and other songs just ripped me tremendously.  And then of course to hear the stirring speech, "I Have A Dream" you know, it had a profound effect upon me.  It only--but it did enhance what I already believed, but I think, I saw there the possibility for America really living up to her ideals of liberty and justice for all.  At that moment I felt that way.  And I think everybody felt that way that were there, this is what America can be.
Speaker 1: Did you happen to see Reverend [Michael Eric] Dyson's article on the woman [Rev. Dr.] Prathia Hall, "When I Have a Dream"?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Concept coming?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.  Prathia was part of our Christian Education Conference about two years ago (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)?
Speaker 2: --Here in Chicago [Illinois].  No I didn't but I heard her speak.  She spoke at our conference and we were-- actually it was held in Oak Brook [Illinois].  I never, never knew her personally, but what a speaker, very, very profound speaker.  And I--that March on Washington really was one of the defining moments in my life, yeah.  It broadened the vision.  And I don't see how anybody could go there and come back and be the same, you know.
Story_ID: 70067
Speaker 1: But while as--working as an insurance--see there're several little vignettes here because I'm doing several things.  While working as an insurance agent, and by the way, in New Jersey, they give you a very rigorous exam for insurance, so I passed that with flying colors.  But--
Speaker 2: They give you a rigorous--
Speaker 1: Yeah, insurance.  It's known that they're very hard on--if you want to be an insurance agent in that state, the exams are really tough. But you know we passed and did all that, what I'm getting to is that once--they had like a in-house organ you write for.  So I was writing for it.  So this friend of mine says you know you are a very good writer.  The New Brunswick Daily Home News is looking for a black reporter, because the Urban League and the NAACP have told them they want to see an African American writer, because they don't feel that they're getting news that helps them as the community, that the reporting is either bias or slanted or not thorough.  She says now you should go and apply for that 'cause you can write.  I says, really, I'm not interested in that and kept on at me--
Speaker 2: What year?
Speaker 1: It was in the mid-sixties.  And so my friend--
Speaker 2: Was it before or after the March [on Washington]?
Speaker 1: It was after the march.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes, it was after the march.  I should say it's, yeah it's like '67 [1967], I guess, something like that.  Anyway just to please my friend, by then, by the way, I had to put it in context, by then I had bought-- I was buying a home.  I was married at the time, buying a home, so when I got married I had a home in Scotch Plains, New Jersey.  So that's a very upscale community.  And he said--I said okay, I'll go just because you're urging me to do it, but I'm really not interested.  I go there, the executive (unclear) meets me, he says, Mr. Soles now we give these, I think it was, five exams, and then we will determine whether or not, you know, you meet our criteria.  Take the five exams, he says, the results, he says the results are astounding.  He says now we have PhDs take this exam, they haven't done as well as you have.  As far as I'm concerned you're hired.  I'm not interested, sir.  Now, Mr. Soles, you can't mean that.  I said, I'm not interested.  He says, would you think about it?  So, I said, well, okay.  I go home and I prayed about it and God said to me, you take that position.  I didn't know all of the reasons why he said that at that time, but of course later on it came out.  So I went back and said, okay, I will.  So then I was--as a cub reporter, this Jewish reporter was the one who was to be my mentor and very good at what he did.  The first thing we did was write obituaries, okay.  Get some accuracy in your reporting, so.  Then after then the executive--the editor said, okay, we want you to cover these different things.  I covered sports, I covered entertainment, I covered politics, education, various categories.  I covered riots.  There were--it was during the time, this was after Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.]--
Story_ID: 70068
Speaker 1: So, [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.], did you say he had just died?
Speaker 2: He had died and there were riots in Newark [New Jersey], in Chicago [Illinois], Detroit [Michigan] and other places.  Newark, being seventeen miles away from Plainfield [New Jersey], that sparked a riot in Plainfield, suburban town, serene suburban town, and I had to cover that, as well as going into Newark and seeing what was there.  So, and some of the people that were involved in that riot in Plainfield I knew.  One of the persons involved, allegedly, a policeman was, I guess, hit or something and she sat on him or something like that.  And I forget the name of this famous attorney, defended her, became a real celebrated case.
Speaker 1: Derkowitz?
Speaker 2: Not Derkowitz.  I just don't recall his name right now.  But Plainfield was in the spotlight because this policeman [John Gleason] was killed as a result of this riot.  And so I had to cover all that as well as covering another situation in Plainfield where a young man went into the police station and wanted to attack a policeman, and I did the story on that and that was--that hit the AP wires and some other stories I did hit the AP wires because during that time it was very tense.  And so as a reporter if you get inside what people were thinking, I could talk to the people, yeah.
Speaker 1: Because a lot of the media used whatever black person they had.
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: They were just starting to take on blacks.  So they sent the blacks in.
Speaker 2: Right. During the time when I was hired by the [New Brunswick Daily] Home News, I think there was one half of one percent of the reporters in America were African American on white papers, that's all, one half of one percent.  That was a figure that constantly quoted to show the disparity in terms of black reporters on white newspapers. One of the persons who was very instrumental in I think in encouraging me too was named Mel Good.  Mel was out of Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], and just a great advocate you know of blacks in journalism.
Speaker 1: And you remember when he went to CVS?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  I do.  I just had a great admiration for him.  And I guess it was during that time maybe there was Vernon Jarrett [HM] involved here in Chicago, yeah.  But there's very few because it's very hard to break that barrier.
Story_ID: 70069
Speaker 1: And I have some incidents that I--can I relate?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: There was a meeting of blacks in the automotive industry at Rutgers University [New Brunswick, New Jersey].  It was like a seminar to talk about forming a union of African Americans in the automotive industry.  It was closed to the press.  The--so because I knew one of the persons was part of that, I was able to get in and write a story.  I write the story like for Saturday edition.  On Monday into the newsroom walks this gentleman, some of the people knew who he were--he was, rather.  He was from FBI, and he wanted to know, "Soles, did you see anyone or hear anyone who--that was there who might be considered subversive, who was anti-American, who spoke about things that would overthrow this government, and he went down the line, just down the line.  I said, well, first of all as a reporter, I don't divulge my sources, but nothing that I heard would be in those categories that you mentioned.  And he says now if you cooperate with us, you know, we'll take you to the, Hoover Building in Washington [D.C.], we'll do this, we'll do this for you and all like that and maybe get some jobs, you know.  He went on down the line and I knew where he was going.  So we ended the conversation, my phone was tapped.  They could find nothing.  This is during the J. Edgar Hoover era where black leaders were being followed or being put down.  That's what he did.  And I think The Freedom of Information Act will show that he did that if one wants to go to those files.  But they certainly did that to me.  I mean they tried their best to get something from me on somebody which they could not do because there was nothing to get, yeah.  So that was a very critical point in my journalistic career because you know that they wanted to use me.
Speaker 2: How did that feel to you?
Speaker 1: It didn't feel very nice.  I was very upset about that, that the government would do such a thing.  And particularly, and you're a journalist.  I was not going to compromise my convictions.  I mean, had I saw that, someone saying something, they have freedom of speech, they can say whatever they want to say because somebody says it doesn't mean they gonna do anything about it.  And so I think that, you I just had problems, but that was during the time you know with the, I guess, anticommunism and so forth, you know, yeah.
Story_ID: 70070
Speaker 1: How many years did you work as a professional journalist?
Speaker 2: Two years and it was during that period--I got to tell you the story though.  In--once I did the various--covered the various segments in sports and music and all these other things and politics, the editor promoted me to a beat.  Of course being in an area that you covered exclusively.  And I covered this particular town near New Brunswick [New Jersey].  They--I mean I covered every aspect of it.  A developer came into town and said I want to build condominiums.  And at that time the concept of the condominium was not very clear, you know, people--what is that.  And so the city thought it's gonna bring in a lot of these people in town, new schools have to be built and the traffic's gonna clog the road.  We don't want these condominiums.  So the developer says, well, I can understand your feelings but we have some developments from California and we would like for you to come to California to you know to see what we have.  So they agreed, and he said we'll bring the reporter.  Of course the newspaper said, well no, he is not going to fund your way out there.  I said, that's right, I know that, because that's not--ethically that's not good.  They said, but we'll send you, that's fine with me.  So I went to California.  We get to LA [Los Angeles] Airport and you have this revolving restaurant up there.  And so the guy, the owner tried his best to influence me to write a very positive story on his behalf.  And I said, I know what you're trying to do, I will not be swayed by that.  I'm a journalist, I will call the shots as I see them.  So I went to Torrance [California], Santa Barbara [California], Newport Beach [California], Marina Del Ray [California], and I observed the various condominiums that they had.  Then I--then I found two things, I found discrimination in one, and I think in another one where they had--they didn't want any type of diversity at all, and I wrote that.  Of course, you know the developer was furious.  Of course back home they were happy that I discovered this, you see.  So that's one reason why they didn't really want to develop (unclear).  If you gon' have this type of you know condominiums where you going to have discrimination, we can't have that in our town.  So the developer, ultimately, made changes, and eventually did get--but this was several years afterwards.  But the stories from (unclear) fathers that this developer was not the right one for them at that time.  And by the way the developer was part of a huge conglomerate, a company that's still existing today, a big one.  And so it's a subsidiary.  But that story pointed out the inconsistencies in them.
Story_ID: 70071
Speaker 1: But while there I got a call from Chicago [Illinois], a gentleman who asked me that--he was starting up this company and he wanted me to come to Chicago to be the editor because a mutual friend had told him about me.  Again, I was reluctant because, well, first of all the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra had offered me a position as director of public relations.  It required working on Sundays and for that reason I turned it down.  It certainly was a much higher salary than this gentleman was going to offer me, of course he's starting something, although he's going to be funded by another company.  He came three times.  And finally I gave into--and by the way the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra at that time was headed by Henry Lewis.  Henry Lewis was the first African American to lead a major symphony orchestra.  I interviewed him and his wife Marilyn Horne who is with the Metropolitan Opera today.
Speaker 2: Is that Henry Lewis?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Not Henry Louis Gates?
Speaker 1: No.  This is Henry Lewis, he was a conductor, and he married Marilyn Horne of the Metropolitan Opera, and they lived in South Orange, New Jersey.  And I interviewed him and that's why they offered me the job because they said they liked the interview.  And I should never forget Henry Lewis because as an African American he's trying to get young people interested in classical music.  So how do you do this?  So what he did in Newark, New Jersey in the housing projects, the orchestra went to the kids.  And so Mr. Lewis was conducting and he says I'm gonna play a song for you and you got to tell me the name of it.  And he said, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, the William Tell Overture, and they said, oh, the Lone Ranger.  He said, that's right, said oh, that's it.  And he had 'em because he tied the classical music to the radio or to the movies, but he's good background music.  He was great.  He's dead now, but he was really tremendous.
Story_ID: 70072
Speaker 1: So I decided then to come to Chicago [Illinois] to be part of this company.
Speaker 2: What was the name of the company?
Speaker 1: The company was going to be called Urban Ministries, Inc.  But the gentleman was working for a company called Scripture Press in Wheaton [Illinois] and he's African American.  But he wanted to develop Sunday school literature that would fit the needs of African American young people because he felt that literature that was presently out there didn't really speak where they were.
Speaker 2: But before we bring you to Chicago, go back and tell me, you had finished your ministerial training?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: You got married and some other things happened?
Speaker 1: After this earthquake (unclear) shaking.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  Before you came to Chicago?
Speaker 1: Right.  I did get married before I came, that's right.
Speaker 2: So tell me how, at what point you incorporated marriage and at what point you finished you ministerial training into your reporting and all that period?
Speaker 1: Well, I had finished my ministerial training before I got married.  And--
Speaker 2: What year did you finish [at Manhattan Bible Institute, New York City, New York]?
Speaker 1: --Sixty, was it '64 [1964], yeah, I think it '64 [1964], yeah.
Speaker 2: And before you started working for the newspaper?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Right.  Before I started working for the newspaper.  That's when I finished my ministerial training.  And so I was considered the reporter who was a minister and who called the shots as I saw them.  I covered a police raid where the police came into this African American apartment that was owned by an elderly black woman and her nephew was staying with her.  And they had a raid on her apartment at what--3:00 or 4:00 am in the morning.  Now imagine somebody coming to your door knocking (unclear) taking a hatchet and banging, you know, and then you're an elderly woman.  Just because you want to get a suspect and bring him into custody and of course she was terrified.  And I wrote that story.  I mean this was--the tactics were unprofessional and was not necessary, and of course you know, now once you highlight something, everybody starts making apologies or you know excuses for whatever they do.  And it was not necessary to do that to get the young man and as far as I know he didn't do anything but that's the point is that but they wanted to get him.  So those human interest types of stories where people are being hurt, we try to be an advocate to the extent that we get facts.  We didn't give opinions, we gave the facts, 'cause if you gonna write as a reporter, you know you supposed to be straight with the news, right.  An opinion piece, okay that's different but--so we had a chance to be advocate for people.  I covered with court trials, one of the judges said my wife couldn't make it to the trial but she said she read your account of the trial and she felt that she was there.  Well, obviously any reporter would feel you know very humbled by that and those types of things.  And we try to work with people who were--didn't have a voice, yes, as well as dealing with the cultural stuff and the other types of things that we did.  So as I think what being a journalist did to me was to broaden my perspective and it set the basis for what I'm doing now.  I have mult-multiple interests, yes.
Speaker 2: And it allows you to serve better.
Speaker 1: Yes, to serve.
Story_ID: 70073
Speaker 1: How and when did you meet your wife [Effie Soles] and at what point did you get married?
Speaker 2: Well, it's interesting because we had a mutual friend and she was head of the youth ministry at her church in Newark [New Jersey], very large church, and my friend was already married and had about several kids and so, he says, "I met somebody I think would be perfect for you," you know, kind of put us together.  I said, oh, yeah, really?  So I meet this beautiful young lady and I mean she was beautiful on the outside but of course I was looking for somebody that was not only beautiful but inside too but she had both.  She had a real commitment to God, she's intelligent, knowledgeable and a sweet spirit.  I met her mother, just a great woman.  My wife is a native of Virginia.  So anyway we dated and my friend says, now, when you gonna give her a ring?  You know he was the type that pushed me into this, you know.  I said, really wasn't ready.  So anyway, so I go and I get this ring and you know I sit down and talk to her and you know and I said I got something for you and I gave her the ring, you know.  Well, she looked at that ring, she said, you're not ready, this cheap ring, said you are not ready.  I was hurt, but she was right 'cause I was being pushed into something.  Well, but she was nice, though, I mean.  Anyway, so that was that and so she went back and she dated somebody else and that's the time I just left and came back here [Chicago, Illinois].  I said that's the end of that.  But it wasn't the end of it though because you know I have a thing on my heart that she was the one for me.  And before her there was another young lady I liked very much and--but I could tell she was the one.  She had all the qualities that I desired in a mate.
Speaker 1: Give us her name?
Speaker 2: Her name?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Effie, E-F-F-I-E.  Her maiden name was Whittle, W-H-I-T-T-L-E, Effie Whittle Soles, I love the sound of that.  And so I went back and I said, you know, the Lord is laying on my heart that you should be my wife, of course that's putting it in religious terms, but that's true.  And so, she says, um, really.  And she says, yeah, we'll see.  So anyway, she saw the light and she says yes, you know, you are the one for me.  I said and you are the one for me.  And that's how we met and solidified the relationship and it was beautiful because she had similar interests as I had.  And besides we attended the same seminary [Manhattan Bible Institute, New York City, New York].
Story_ID: 70074
Speaker 1: Was she [Effie Soles] ordained? Is she ordained?
Speaker 2: Yes, she's ordained.  She's ordained--minister.  She was--I don't think she was ordained at the time.  She is, of course, now.  But she--
Speaker 1: Had she done any evangelism or just teaching and lecturing?
Speaker 2: She's done evangelism, she has a master's in religious education, she has spoken--she spoke in Israel, Africa, Japan, Canada and throughout the United States.  As we travel people love her style because she, she relates very well to people.  The Japanese, quite frankly, did not want her to come back home, they just loved her so much.  And Japanese tradition, you know, a little reserved, not with my wife.  Even the young ones they loved her so much.  She, she has a great spiritual--she has great spiritual insight and love for people, great smile and very beautiful person.
Speaker 1: What year did you meet her?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-one [1971].  So now we have been married, what, thirty-one years, yes.  And this has been a very beautiful relationship.  We decided during that time that we would not have children, and the reason for that I think is because we're doing ministry.  This is only for us, I don't counsel this, that we would be dealing with a whole lot of people.  So we had--so now it proved right because we have children all over the world, you know.  I remember one of our--one of the students at the college who is a white brother, he called the house there and he says Mr. Soles, may I speak to your wife, I said she's not in, he says, oh, I had to call because you know she's like a mother to me and you know, I'm gonna get married in Corsica, well, I'm in Corsica and I'm gonna get married and I had to tell her, let her know before I got married, and then another student from Indonesia, the same thing.  A young lady from Massachusetts said, she calls and she's--she's like a missionary, she goes all over.  She considers my wife as her mentor, mother and she has that, she's international, she do some international students.  And so therefore we, we're comfortable in any setting whether it's Chinese, Japanese, white America, whatever, we love people.  See, even though my background was one, you know, encased in racism in the South, I love people of all stripes and I get along with people, yes.  And I know who I am and I know whose I am.  And I think that's another thing, when you know who you are and that was taught to me early in life, then you could relate to other people who are di--not like you but they're human and that's to me the bottom line, human beings, yeah.
Story_ID: 70075
Speaker 1: Now, we'll go back to the family side for a moment.  You and your sister [Annie Bownes], mom [Pearlie Mae Soles] and dad [Henry Soles, Sr.] came to New Jersey and you finished school, you got out into your professional career, what kind of things were happening family-wise.  You, you added a little baby brother [Roger Soles]?
Speaker 2: Yes. That's interesting--
Speaker 1: --Did you feel like he was taking away your being the baby.
Speaker 2: Well, I think you initially you think well, you know, he's getting all the attention and everything, but that was okay because again I was used to that because we had all the foster children my mother took care of.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that's right.
Speaker 2: See I mean, and my sister and her husband had seven children.  And I helped to raise some of them.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: See, so I mean I was accustomed to that.  I could change the diapers and all like that, that was--and then the kids around me, I mean, you know, I do love kids, I mean, I notice even today kids will--I'll smile at kids they'll come to me.  Because my mother was the one who instilled in us that you love people, that you honor people, and there's something--once that gets into your spirit, I think people can inner read that and they take to you.
Speaker 1: How old were you when your baby brother was born?
Speaker 2: Oh, he was born in, let me see, I have to think a little bit.  I guess I was--I was in my twenties.
Speaker 1: Oh really.  He's a real baby brother.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: I was in my twenties when he was born.  Uh-huh, so there was a space between--my sister's in her seventies, because I'm sixties, my brother's now in his forties.
Speaker 1: So your brother was real impressed with your career counseling athletes, I'm sure?
Speaker 2: Oh, definitely.  He's always talking about this is my brother you know, he knows this one and knows that one and you know, they brag about you like that, but you know I nev--that's another thing, I never set out to be involved with athletes in a counseling mode, because having been one myself, I thought of the sense of arrogance, the sense of you know, me, me, me, me, me, and I didn't want to be part of that.  But again God led me into that through a Navy quarterback from a Navy quarterback who came to our home in Illinois and he was visiting and he was a native of West Virginia.
Speaker 1: So you started that after you came back to--
Speaker 2: Came here, yes.
Speaker 1: --Illinois.
Story_ID: 70076
Speaker 1: Okay. So let's leave New Jersey and come to Illinois.  You're working for the Scripture Press?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And, and for a newspaper?
Speaker 2: Not here.  The newspaper was in New Jersey, right.
Speaker 1: Just the Scripture Press?
Speaker 2: Right, Scripture Press.
Speaker 1: Okay, take it from there.
Speaker 2: Okay, Scripture Press, now being hired at Scripture Press to work on materials for this company [Urban Ministries, Inc.] that was going to be formed, they hired me.  Again, I went to this examination scenario, which of course, is traditional.  Again, having gone through that, the examinations, I was informed later that my scores were the highest in the history of the company.  I had no knowledge, I didn't know anything about it and I don't take test to be high, high, but I'm saying just for the record, and as the first African American hired by them in an editorial position, I was an editor, I was the first.  If you follow the course of my life you'll see this is what happens being a pioneer.  I don't know.  But anyway, so we start out and we develop the materials, we set formats and everything like that and get writers from all over the country.  Okay, in our very first year of operation, we submitted our manuals called "In Teen", I-N, and then T-E-E-N, "In Teen Magazine" specifically geared to teenagers, of course.  They have what they call the Evangelical Press Association, EPA for short, where they encourage people to present their manuals or magazines for evaluation by that particular organization to get awards, you know.  So we presented ours for a category of teenagers, and we, we won a national awards being the best in our field, competing against other more established types of magazines.  It's evaluated by Jim Eagle, I think.  Jim was then the professor of journalism at Ohio State University [Columbus, Ohio].  And that's propelled the company that--when the Urban Ministry started, that propelled it into the public consciousness, because here we have been awarded this you know magazine honor and then been validated by this professor, so therefore it must be good you know.  So that started us on.  And ironically when I was working at Scripture Press, I was still doing the work at Scripture Press for Urban Ministries and we didn't have an office at that time.  Working with me, not in the same category, but what we called a paper's division was a guy named--Jerry's last name--I can't think of Jerry's last name right now, it'll come to me.  But--and today Jerry [Jenkins] is a very well-known writer.  He is--he puts of course what they call "Left Behind" series, yeah, which has been on the New York Times best seller.  He wrote me recently about being on his advisory board, but you know it's--it was that kind of creative atmosphere that we ran at the time, yes.  But--and so we started the magazine, we started the company and won the awards and then be--would do these various trade shows where you go out to try to get churches and other organizations to buy the manuals.  Became very successful. Today, it's located in Calumet City [Illinois], a multimillion dollar corporation that not only puts out Sunday School literature, but videos, books and other related materials.
Speaker 1: How many years did you work with them?
Speaker 2: Seven years, yes.  I serve on the board of the companion organization called Urban Outreach which is a non-profit and we distribute literature free of charge to various non-profit organizations and we also put on a Christian Education Conference every year.  And the last few years have been in Oak Brook [Illinois].  And I'm secretary of the Board of Trustees, yes, love that work.  So I'm still connected, yes.
Story_ID: 70077
Speaker 1: So, you are associate minister at what church?
Speaker 2: DuPage A.M.E. Church in Lisle, Illinois. Lisle is between Wheaton [Illinois] and Naperville [Illinois].  It borders on both towns.  It started in Wheaton.  Wheaton has a reputation as being a religious community because of the Wheaton College [Wheaton, Illinois] where my wife [Effie Soles] is on the staff there and the publishing company is like Christianity Today and others.  Tyndale House has published the Living Bible and the Left Behind series, they published that.  It's in Wheaton, uh-huh.  And so it has that reputation so that's where I came to and that's where we started.
Story_ID: 70078
Speaker 1: So take me back and fold that in--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --And fold your television stuff in.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.  Right after we got married then me and my wife [Effie Soles] came of course to Wheaton [Illinois] where we lived. This gentleman from the Fellowship of Christian Athletes [FCA] was a [U.S.] Navy quarterback.  He visited us and being a hillbilly from West Virginia, he loved the soul food that we had.  So we could relate very well, it was great.  And the discussion arose, and he says, would you be open, meaning would I be open to speaking to the Chicago Bears Chapel?  I thought about it.  I said, well, as an ex-athlete myself, I do know the mindset of athletes and I don't know that I would necessarily be open to that because, you know, I just have a real problem, but if God wants me to do it, I'll do it.  So he said, well, would you speak, and he gave me a Sunday, I said, okay, I'll do that for you.  So I go down and the Bears meet prior to the game.  Now they meet in hotels, but they meet at different locations.  The guys are seated and almost as if, their hands are folded as if to say, well I dare you to move me.
Speaker 1: About what year is this?
Speaker 2: This is 1973, '74 [1974].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, as if to say, well, you know, move me, in other words.  I love challenges.  So I begin to speak, as God gave me the ability to do so, and at the end of the meeting, they were very opened, accepted and affirming and asked me to come back again.  And that's how I got started in sports ministry with the Chicago Bears.  Through the years with the Bears, of course, there was the Walter Peytons and the Mike Singletarys and the guys (unclear) and Vince Evans who was one of the backbones of the chapel for me.  Vince was a Bears quarterback at one point.  And then Mike Ditka later came into the equation as a coach and there were other coaches that were very affirming of what we were trying to do.
Story_ID: 70079
Speaker 1: Let me ask you right here, you said, you said to yourself, "Okay, I'll do it if that's what the Lord decrees."  What kinds of things were going through your mind as you were getting more and more into counseling and praying with athletes, what kind of discoveries were you making about the professional athlete mindset?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, as I said earlier, I didn't necessarily want to do it, but once God led me in that direction, I discovered they had needs like anyone else.  They're in the spotlight constantly.  We put them on the pedestals and imagine that oh, they have the greatest life in the world, you know, they have money, they have fame, and they have the applause of the crowd, but in private moments, they're human beings who have hurts like we have, they have aspirations and dreams like we have.  The difference is, is that they're being paid a hefty sum of money, but they had to work at that.  No one gives it to them.  They have to, they have hard practices, they have to go out and throw their bodies on the line, particularly foot--well, I'm thinking now football.  And then they're human beings who have extraordinary gifts.  But they're just human beings and they're no better than anyone else.  We make them that way.  You say, well, but look what they have accomplished, but then one has to look, what have you accomplished?  You've accomplished things in your life, too.  You may not be applauded by people, but if you raise a family, if you go to school, if you have a job or if you work in your community, those are accomplishments that need to be applauded too.  So I try to tell people don't look upon them as heroes.  Heroes are people who act courageously in a moment of trial or challenge.  Athletes are entertainers.  And they are--as entertainers then they have to make sure that they do their best so the crowd is gonna pay, you know, for the tickets and have a good time, and everybody goes home happy.  But they're human beings, and once you get to know them, they're like anyone else.
Speaker 1: But that--all the accolades and the money and they often come into it unexpectedly and very early and without a foundation, that's a heavy burden to have.
Speaker 2: It's a very heavy burden, depending upon the preparation they've had prior to coming to the professional sports arena.  If they come from families where the home was in disarray, or even being the son of a single parent, it can be very difficult to make the adjustment into professional field because there are so many things coming at you outside of the game, you know.  You know there are women who are there to get you, not because they love you, but because of the money that you have.  There are agents who want to use you for their own professional reasons.  There are--there are any number of people out there to use you, and even your so-called friends can be there to use you, and you have to know who is my real friend or because some people will be with you as long as you're doing well, and when you're not doing well, they, hey, they abandon you.  So--so a lot of that's going on in your mind.  Whom can I trust, I think is the key question.  Whom can I trust?  So that can lead you into a sense where you might have to feel, you might feel that you can't trust anybody or that you feel, even though you're surrounded by people, you feel lonely.  So those psychological and spiritual things come--come into your mind.
Story_ID: 70080
Speaker 1: So do you find that as, in large measure, a part of the concerns of a professional athlete?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, I think so, yes.  And the other concern is that many of them do not want to leave the game.  Once you get involved in the process and if you've been there a long time, you know, that's all you know.  And so how do you go--I say it's kind of phrase, I guess, that I coined, I think of professional sports and the--and then the people that play professional sports, I think of them as people who have an extended adolescence, in other words, you don't grow up till you get out of the sport, because you've been pampered from the minute you--your parents saw that you have ability to high school, to college, everybody's pampering you.  And you begin to think that's your right.  And once you get out--I won't name this athlete but this athlete, well-known athlete, he leaves the sport, everything had always been done for him.  He goes to the cleaning establishment and some other places he didn't know what to do, because he never had to do it himself.  Somebody always did it for him.  To me that is not the type of life that I want.  But that's the type of life they have because we put them on the pedestal.  And I always say, you put you on the pedestal and when you don't do well then they knock you off.
Speaker 1: So within the spiritual context how do you help get them ready to make that transition?
Speaker 2: Okay.  First of all we do it through the chapel program.  The chapel program which I participated or led in football, baseball, basketball and soccer, the four principal sports, I would say.  In football, the chapel is held every Sunday prior to a game.  It can be at a hotel room where they will have a breakfast after you speak.  That goes for the home team and the opposing team.  In baseball, they have what they call a baseball chapel.  Again, you speak to the home team and the opposing side.  They're not to meet together, the same in football, they don't meet together, players, you have a chapel separately.  And in football you not only have a Protestant chapel, but you have a Catholic chapel in football too.  In basketball, since I founded the program for the [Chicago] Bulls in 1979, I felt that would be good to have the players together from both teams.  And they agreed.  And so United Center we have one chapel room where players from both teams who want to participate come into that setting. We have a fifteen minute chapel service.  The first five minutes, well actually we have an opening where we ask the player to give a prayer, because we like participatory types of things.  The next five minutes is a message either from myself or the assistant chaplain.  And then the next five minutes we use to get them in a kind of interaction mode where we ask questions and we want their opinions about what they heard, has this helped you or how could you apply this in your life?  Give us some experiences you've had with God that will let us know that he's real to you, or what concerns do you have, what problems do you have or whatever is on your mind, we want them to share.  And some of them can be very profound in their statements.  So it's in that fifteen minute package that we're able to do this, you know, speak, prayer, speaking, and then the interaction and then the final the closing prayer.  So it covers a full spectrum in fifteen minutes.  Anybody who wants, yes, counseling--I remember I was in Toronto [Canada] and I get this phone call, and it's from a player on the Bulls.  And first of all I said, how did you get my number, it's 2:00 am in the morning.  He said, well your wife [Effie Soles] gave me the number.  I said, okay.  So what he wants to talk about is a contract dispute as well as personal problems.  And so--so that was a counseling session there or you go into homes, and we've had bible studies or you counsel people in other settings that problems arise and. and you know.  In one case we had a player who was on one of the teams who was into drugs.  The team tried to help him and it wasn't as effective as it should have been, and we tried to help him, but he tried to run away 'cause he knew what we were gonna talk about.  But later on at a big event he came up and he said, Reverend Soles the reason why I changed my telephone number and I was trying to avoid you, was because that I knew you would tell me the truth.  He says I want to share with you that I'm married now, and I apologize for that and thank you for, you know, being concerned about me.  And numerous stories of guys that were helped and their wives, or you know, in a marital situation, yes.  And by the way, see that is unpaid now.  We do this as a ministry, so it's not that I get a lot of money for it, I don't.  We do it as a ministry and--and this is supported by those who believe in what we're doing.  So that's how that is.  So we provide the service to the teams.
Story_ID: 70081
Speaker 1: Is there any other particular experience or expression of what you do with professional athletes, any other experience that sticks out for you?
Speaker 2: There are a number of them.  I'm just trying to remember--try to remember some of them sometimes is a--I remember there's a player who was with an opposing team.  He came to Chicago [Illinois].  He was having kind of a down time in his game.  He's a super star.  So he goes to talk to Michael Jordan. He was talking to Michael, and Michael told him, well, now you know this is part of what happens in your career, you know.  Don't let it get you down, because this particular player had been accused of trying to get rid of the coach of his team.  So Michael said that goes, that's true, Michael was absolutely correct.  So for the first time ever, he comes to chapel in Chicago.  I don't make any big to do about it at all because they all are treated the same.  So I give this message, he comes to me, and you know, oh, that was a great message, Rev., thank you so much.  He goes out, he scores, I think, 36 or 37 points against Scottie Pippin.  It's hard to do, but anyway.
Speaker 1: Against Scottie Pippin?
Speaker 2: Yeah, against Scottie, and so anyway, he comes back, he says, oh, oh, thank you Reverend, so much for that.  And so some of the guys on the [Chicago] Bulls who had attended chapel that night, said Reverend, now you supposed to be on our side you know.  I said, I said first of all I'm here, I'm neutral when it comes to the Gospel, I'm here to meet the needs of both teams, okay.  And secondarily, so I have no favorites.  I say, secondarily, what are you complaining about, you weren't even there.  You should have been there.  Yeah.  And there have been other situations where you know the guys would come in with different problems.  Oh, and by the way, we have some journalists that come into chapel, but the rule is that they're not supposed to write anything about what the players say, because that is closed, yeah.  And it's never been violated, 'cause if it is then they can't come in.  The other thing is we had this very famous, very famous athlete in another sport.  And some people wanted to--in fact it was a network.  The person came in and says, Reverend, the anchor, no but I think or the interviewer wants to interview this particular person, and we want everybody out of the room.  I said well this is my room. He says but you don't understand, Reverend.  I do understand.  The only people that will leave this room will be the interviewer and the athlete.  And in frustration he runs out of the room and then about five minutes after, another person from this network comes in.  He came, comes in he says, Reverend, I'm so sorry.  See he's new, he didn't know.  Here's some T-shirts, here's some other, you know, logo types of items that you could have.  I'm so sorry he just didn't know.  I said, well fine, and I said either they can come in, obviously, but we will still be in this room.  And of course they did.  I could tell the name of the--you know the athlete that was going to be interviewed had nothing to do with this.  This was the guy that was going to interview him, it was the problem, but the athlete had nothing to do with it.  It was Tiger Woods.  But he had nothing to do with it. See, to United Center would come people like Jay Leno, Denzel Washington, Spike Lee and Tiger Woods and Prince and all these people, and some of them, you know, I would interact with some of them.  Denzel, I remember, I said, well, Denzel, you know your father's a minister, perhaps he preferred you had been a minister.  He says, well, but Reverend, I'm trying to do the types of films that he knows, but be positive, you know.  It's those types of things.  So I interact with a whole lot of people that are not necessarily in professional sports, but are celebrities, and I think the thread that runs through all of that is that they are in the spot light and they may have to always be armed.  And trying to be themselves in the public is a little difficult because if they try to be themselves in the public sometimes, the public says, oh, you're not supposed to be human, you're supposed to be up there.  But yet they want them to be human but at the same time, they don't want 'em.  It's like a contradiction, you know.
Story_ID: 70082
Speaker 1: So then pretty much the way you would deal with the spiritual needs of a pro-athlete, it would be just about that way with a well-known celebrity type.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah because those are the one I interact with but I also, I hasten to add, I also done chapels for colleges and high schools, so that we deal with athletes at various levels, but mostly professionals because that is of my calling is, but and I not only deal with the arenas, but the big arenas be going to the college settings also, high school.  When we're in Japan we went to the public schools in Japan.  They wanted us to come and speak to the young people at the middle, I'm sorry at the grammar school level and middle school and high school.  And we did that in that context.  And I've spoken at like the University of Iowa, University of Illinois, schools of that ilk and things of that nature, to a fraternity of all things, invited us to come to the University of Iowa, unheard of.  Fraternities don't invite ministers.
Speaker 1: There is a contradiction.
Speaker 2: You're right.  And the reason for that was because one of the graduates of that school played for the [Chicago] Bulls and they knew that I was a chaplain, so they wanted to hear what I had to say, yeah, so.  It happened.
Speaker 1: Now, let us look at your area of spiritual ministry that I know about with businessmen--
Speaker 2: And women.
Speaker 1: --And women, owners, executives, managers, supervisors, secretaries, clerks even, across the spectrum. Would you talk about your weekly business, prayer group, how it got started and progressed?
Speaker 2: Thank you for that question.  That comes out of the context of my sports ministry because once we started the sports ministry, in football, it went to baseball, the baseball players and their wives wanted to have home bible studies, and we did that.  But they also wanted to have a place downtown [Chicago, Illinois] that they could come to if they needed to during the week.  So we started the bible studies for athletes and business persons in the Loop in a law office on Michigan Avenue, on North Michigan Avenue, and, and it was very successful, so we decided to continue it.  I didn't know it was going to continue as long as it has, but that's how it got started.
Speaker 1: What year?
Speaker 2: That was in the '70s [1970s] too, I don't even remember the year.  I just know it was in the '70s [1970s], probably mid-70s [1970s], and we've been gone ever since in various locations.  As you know we were at NBC, we've been to Quaker Oats and other venues, and presently we're at the Owens Group on LaSalle Street.  Yeah, we're at the Insurance Exchange Building, oh yeah, also Bank One which was then called First Chicago.  And prior to that we were at Continental Bank, which of course is no longer in business.  So we've gone around different locations and people just come from various places you know to for that type of ministry.

Speaker 1: Now, is there a difference in the businessperson's needs as opposed to the professional athlete?  I mean I know we're all human but--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --But it's a different dynamic.  How do you handle it?
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  Let's see there are commonalities, both of them are professionals.  They have goals that they have to achieve or try to achieve.  They are in a sense public light and they're trained.  One of the differences is of course is that professional athletes are in effect entertainers, highly paid, as a rule.  Also businesspersons can be highly paid too as you well know, but they are--they work for us kind of a short period of time.  In baseball it's 160 plus games, in football it's in the professional, it's only 16, basketball, 82 games.  So very small slice at a time, but the business person working the whole year.  And they also--the athletes again are always in front of the public, and they're being evaluated by that public and they're being written about in the news media on a continuing basis.  Now we know a business person can written too in the media, but it's not on an ongoing basis all the time, despite Enron and Worldcom.  But both of them I think are very achievement oriented.  They want to--they love challenges and they want to be the best at whatever they do.  So there are similarities and there are dissimilarities, of course.  But both of them, as I said, I think they're achievement oriented, I don't think, I know they are.
Speaker 1: This willingness to give up the game, do you find that with business people.  This unwillingness, I should say, to give up the game, unwillingness to give up the business (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: There are some who have been in business for an extended period of time who think of whatever they do as their baby and they don't want to give it up because it's such a vital part of their lives, it becomes their identity.  And if you take that away from them then somehow their identity is lost and they might think of themselves as less significant persons because the identity was tied to whatever they were doing.  And once it's gone perhaps they're gone in a sense.  So I think it does, that thread does run into the business arena also, not to the extent I don't think that it would a professional athletes, because you keep in mind, a professional athletes, many of them come out of college and go right into professional sports, and some now even come out of high school. So they haven't had a chance to experience the world at all, which can be a detriment to young people (unclear).  Suddenly they're in professional sports, and all these things are coming at them, and they don't know how to process all of that, and they need advisors and mentors.  And wherever we can help, we try to help.  But I think business persons also they--they realize that they are employed as--well, they are owners, but I mean those that are employed, there's job insecurity.  Now, you could say, well the athletes have job insecurity too, but usually they have a contract for a stated number of years and they know how long they gonna be there, yeah.  But in the business arena you don't always know that.  So that's one of the differences.
Story_ID: 70084
Speaker 1: --Now one of the things I noticed having participated in your prayer group at various points, I noticed that the business people that participate, they will sometime come concerned or burdened with a problem and they get something from that particular afternoon session that allows them to see a way through--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Some problem that may be waiting for them back at the office--
Speaker 2: True.
Speaker 1: --And that kind of thing.  Is that the same kind of thing that happens with your professional athletes?
Speaker 2: Indeed, it does.  Sometimes that is the case.  Like the gentleman I mentioned earlier who had to--had a problem that he had to deal with and he found a solution for it.  Yes, some of them do find that solution in coming to the--a prayer session.  They see their way clearer and they go away with a more affirmative type of mindset, and they play a better game of course.  See I tell 'em that I'm not here to pray for you to win, I'm here to give you some tools to empower you live better lives and to respect other people and to be all that you can be, and to serve God above all.  And there was a reporter from the Cleveland Plain Dealer wrote a story about the chapel service.  He says we notice that Reverend Soles doesn't show partiality when he's in chapel, his relation to the [Chicago] Bulls, but when asked does he pray for them, he says well he said after chapel you know, so in that sense.  But I'm praying for them as individuals that they do well because--and another thing we pray for is that--that there would not be serious injuries because that is a problem in any of the games.  And by the way professional basketball in many ways is the toughest of the sports.  First of all they have no protective hair, I mean head gear or uniforms.  They're running all the time and in the professional level, the guys are battling under the basket, it's rough under that basket.  And you gotta keep your wind, and you gotta do all these things, and you gotta score baskets and you gotta be the defenses, the offenses, it is a very tough sport, professional basketball, yes.  And by the way, what we do with sports, business and things like has caught the attention of several news organizations, be it the television.  I remember in New Orleans [Louisiana] during the last basketball strike, we were down there, another conference.  So one of the reporters from the New Orleans Times Picayune came and interviewed me.  And the story came out in the next day's paper.  And it says according to Reverend Doles, they misspelled my name, D-O-L-E-S, and so I got teased about that.  Oh, how you doing Reverend Doles, you know.  Oh, it was funny, but, and as part of what we did--we took a group of athletes to Kenya in East Africa.  The idea was to--it was an outreach and at the same time to help them to show people in that part of the world what professional basketball is like.  So we go to Nairobi [Kenya] and then we went to the arena and they went through the pre-game warm ups as they normally do and showing them tactics and so forth that they utilize and then had a prayer service and people made commitments to Christ, a whole basketball team from that area.  Then we went up to the Maasai Mara and we stayed overnight with the Maasai Tribe, amongst the lions and all of those wild animals.  And I remember one of the wives in the middle of the night she heard this sound and it was a threatening sound and she just knew the animal had invaded their living quarters there and so she says--she says I said the Lord's Prayer, the 23rd Psalm and everything (unclear), said I was really frightened--
Story_ID: 70085
Speaker 1: We were at Kenya she had said every prayer she knew.
Speaker 2: Every prayer she knew.
Speaker 1: And they were answered because she came out all right.
Speaker 2: She came out of it.  She was with her husband, but see the husband, I guess, was asleep, and she heard this noise.  I guess she was screaming.  Because see we were right out in the Maasai village.  This was in the heart of the Maasai Mara, a game preserve, and animals are all around you so we had this other gentleman that was with us, another chaplain for another [basketball] team, and he says, his wife was not with him, so he says, I'll stay in this hut by myself.  And he was in the hut by himself and in the middle of the night the hut start shaking and he said, oh, it's a lion, it's a lion, it's a lion, what am I gonna do, oh, God, help me, help me, and the animal did not enter into the hut, but it gave him the scare of his life.  And I tease him because I--when I go down to Orlando [Florida], he's pastor of First Presbyterian of Orlando, and--it's a huge church and I tease him.  He said you won't let me live that down, will you?  I said, no, I won't.
Speaker 1: So these are huts, you're not in tents?  Well, in tents, they will eat you up.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they're a combination, some of them like kind of huts and then there was like another building but it was like one room or something and a bath, yeah.
Speaker 1: This was a collection of NBA players who went on this trip?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right, collection, right, and their wives.
Story_ID: 70086
Speaker 1: Do you ever conduct retreats for the athletes?  I mean from their environment where they can really take a couple of days and go--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, we have been--certainly we did one out in a town that was in the news recently, it's near San Antonio [Texas], and we did one in this town, it's like, what you call it, not a ranch town, I wish I could think of the name of it, it begins with a B, that's why I said it's been in the news.  But anyway it's near San Antonio, we had a retreat there.  We had speaking, then we played tennis and you know and golf and all those other things, yes and we had bible study, yeah.  And that way they got away from everything, yes.
Story_ID: 70087
Speaker 1: So today your ministry business being the pro-athlete, the everyday person--
Speaker 2: And the entertainers.
Speaker 1: --The entertainers.
Speaker 2: Yes, as well as other politicians.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  We do--we pray for the elected officials of our town before their meetings, you know, we've been asked to do that and things of that nature.
Speaker 1: So then your ministry--
Speaker 2: Is in the marketplace.
Speaker 1: --Well no, has grown by referral, this ministry of entertainers, pro-athletes and so on.  That has been a referral thing, unplanned?
Speaker 2: Very much so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  It's by referral and you're right.  And someone will say, like I got a call the other day from a judge out in the western suburbs, he says, I understand you did men's retreat for this church and they recommended you. We want to go to Lake Geneva [Wisconsin] and would like to know if you're available to speak for us men, you know.  Or someone will call from Florida, and we've been in Naples two or three times.  Naples is a very nice community if you got money.  But anyway, we've been there, and we did television and radio and newspaper covered the events and one particular thing that occurred that was very meaningful to me in Naples.
Story_ID: 70088
Speaker 1: In Naples [Florida] we had--it's a town that--very wealthy, it's called Collier County, Florida.  It's a town that's reclaimed out of the Everglades really, even though it's on the sea, and they don't want homeless people there, because it hurts the image you know, after all this is an upscale town.  Well anyway, this church that invited me told me that they've had a difficult time because they like to befriend the homeless.  And they got into financial trouble and they were about to lose the church.  But one of the ladies at the church brought this homeless man into the church, prayed with him and he made a profession of faith in Christ.  He said to them I would like to do something for the church.  They said, well, we realize you don't have any money.  He says, but I still would like to do something for the church.  So he comes back and he says here is my gift to the church.  And they looked at the check he gave them and the check was for $985,000.  This homeless man was an heir to a fortune who had lost his way, got into alcoholism, nobody cared about him, nobody wanted him didn't know anything about him at all.  This lady reached out in love, brought him to the church, changed his life and he saved the church by giving that money so they could continue on ministry that they have, almost a million dollars. I met that man, talked with him, yes.  He was part of my men's breakfast that I did.  It's a powerful story.  And even though I deal with athletes and business persons, the other side of me, I also deal with the poor and I tell people I deal with the up and in and the down and out, so that the up and in can help the down and out because I think that's where my heart is, those that are really hurting, nobody cares for them, they have nobody to speak for them.  That's obvious through my journalism, I did that, and also ministry-wise, and we brought some athletes to Englewood here in Chicago.  Several occasions, the ball players they spoke and other occasions we spoke for the graduation exercises in Englewood, Ward of Community Center in Englewood.  You know, we'll go and we have a ministry also that reaches out to the people in the Robert Taylor Homes, young people.  It's called Gospel Outreach.  So that's the other side of the coin, going to those that have so that they can help those that do not have.
Story_ID: 70089
Speaker 1: But going back to Africa and being in that setting, I recall you know being in a Land Rover riding along in the midst of all these animals, you could see them, they just roaming.  We were in the prisons, not them, 'cause they had free use of the land.  So we get up to this group of lions, mother lion, papa lion and little lion and the cubbies they call 'em.  And they're looking, licking their tongue, like that, you know.  Well, we didn't have to worry because see they had eaten the wildebeest.  Wildebeest are these animals that are very plentiful and they--the lions gonna catch one and kill 'em.  If you the slowest member of the wildebeest pack, that's it.  And then we even got out and walked around, but in a prescribed area.  You don't dare go in certain areas because the animals will come after you.  But it was a very interesting experiment.  Good for the basketball players.  And I remember Artis Gilmore, he used to be with the [Chicago] Bulls was one of the guys who went with us and we said, Artis, you're seven feet tall, now you see that giraffe over there, why don't you dunk on him?  'Cause everybody would laugh, you know.  And then as we were nearing another area where the elephants were, you know, like in a pack, and all of a sudden, out from that pack dashed this big elephant.  He assumed that we were gonna come after them, and he was coming after us.  The Land Rover so we got out of there, interesting situation.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) flat tire.
Speaker 1: No, no, no, no, but we had a very good guide and--but we were--but that was marvelous being out there.  And when I set my feet on the soil of Africa, I felt this is home.  This is where my ancestors came from.  And there was this connection right immediately.  We also stopped in Nigeria, Senegal, and Liberia.
Speaker 2: Was that your first trip to Africa?
Speaker 1: First trip to Africa, yes.  And it was a very meaningful experience to me because it brought a sense of connectedness to my roots, and I learned so much too, even with the various tribes and they had governmental structures, that's never written about, and it was clearly defined.  But people--Europeans came and said well these people don't have anything and they don't know anything, but that's not true because doing historical research, you know, the great historian Herodotus, a Greek historian, wrote in his book about the Africans and how tall they were and how handsome they were and developed--how developed they were, I mean, but if you were to read some of our history, you don't get that impression, you know, until you do your own research and you begin to see that, that we come from a great people, a great continent, where mankind began.  That's what scientists are saying.  We started in Africa and you move out from that.  And the Bible talks about the Garden of Eden and you know and the rivers that grow out from Ethiopia and other the things like that.
Story_ID: 70090
Speaker 1: Okay, before we talk about your television work, let me ask you this about the professional athlete of today and the one of say two or three decades ago, was it a big difference in this?
Speaker 2: Well, the difference is that they more highly paid, they get more publicity, they have a better pension plan, they--they, yes, the difference is one of economics and better training.  And also today's athletes have so many more outlets for their gifts.  I mean you get the commercials, you get any number of things, endorsements.  Whereas the athletes of old, they got some of those things, but not to the degree that the athletes today, and my feeling is that today's athletes should remember them and try to help them 'cause some of them got penniless and some of them have died penniless.  It's so--it's a shame as the race to baseball, of course, you know, you had the Negro Leagues and some great players, like Josh Gibson or Double Duty [Ted Radcliffe], he's here in Chicago [Illinois], he's in his nineties, still around, and they were not allowed to be in baseball until Jackie Robinson came along and then you had, you know, integration and Larry Doby on the American League with the Cleveland Indians.  There were great athletes, but then finally baseball said we're gonna put these guys in the Hall of Fame 'cause it's only right cause they didn't have the opportunity to be part of the Major Leagues as they call Major Leagues.  So, yes, there is a difference between today's athletes, professional athletes and those of yesteryear.  It's not that they're better in terms of their abilities, but better training as I said, more money, more opportunities to extend their economic desires.
Speaker 1: So today's athlete--am I right in assuming they don't have as many social graces, their rough edges show a little more, or is it that we didn't allow certain rough edges to be shown in the old days?
Speaker 2: Interesting question.  Because there is this thing about some athletes today more into the rap style or the gangster image, things of that nature.  I think what athletes do, some of them, not all of them, reflect the social trend of the moment, and they bring it over into the athletic arena, at least the dressing style or hair style or talk or whatever.  They reflect the prevailing social movement of the moment, and--but athletes of yesteryear, I think were more--they were very concerned about their image, they wanted to look the part and not be threatening, you know, and just be good at what they did to try to be part of you know, the game.  Can you imagine Jackie Robinson going around doing something like--Jackie Robinson was a pioneer, but see he was--now he was a hero because what he did, he subjected himself to--he allowed himself to be called names to be spat upon, threatened, everything, but he held his cool.  By nature he wasn't that type of person, he was a fighter, but he disciplined himself to an extent.  And because he disciplined himself, other guys today can enjoy the fruits of his labor.
Story_ID: 70091
Speaker 1: So should we assume that role models of today are not exactly the same as they used to be as far as encouraging and inspiring youth?
Speaker 2: Well, let's put it this way, there are some role models in today's athletes, but one gets the impression that a number of them are just out for the money and out for--their doing their own thing, or as we would say, the vernacular their own thang.  So one gets that impression, but there are guys today who have set up foundations and who are doing things for people in the communities.  So, to make a broad generalization, I care not to do that, but I would just say that it appears on the surface that today's athletes are less caring and more selfish than athletes of yesteryear. But--yeah.
Speaker 1: And within the context some athletes today feel like they are not and don't have to be role models, a la Charles Barkley and whoever else you can name--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --And some don't seek it out, I mean, they take it on by osmosis, but they feel not responsible to be there.  What do you think of that?
Speaker 2: Yes, some of them feel that way.  Charles did say--Charles Barkley did say that some years ago.  And he says, I'm not your role model, your parents should be your model.  That's a--obviously, that's a half truth to an extent, parents should be role models.  But the fact of the matter is that athletes become role models by virtue of the fact they're in the public spot light and they do, you know, great feats and kids look up to them.  So they do have that responsibility.  So it's a cop out to say that they are not role models, they are.  It may be negative or positive, but you know, they are.  And they have to think that way.  And I think it sometimes what goes around, comes around.  If today they're acting like they don't care, eventually it comes around where they gonna have to be that way, because the public is tired of it after a while and they won't support.  If baseball players go on strike, some people say, well, I'm not going to baseball games, and I'm not going to support.  So the public pays bills, and what some athletes have to understand is that they're not an island to themselves, they have a responsibility to management, to the public and to themselves to be a positive influence, not a negative influence.  And so we try to get them to understand that.
Story_ID: 70092
Speaker 1: One of the things that comes to mind, for me, about Tiger Woods, he's kind of very careful not to be a role model or not be one.  Obviously he's one just be virtue of his talent, but he doesn't, it seems to me on the level that I know, he doesn't encourage it from any group, black, white, gray, green or whatever.  So it seems like he's trying to avoid or abdicate that responsibility, which is automatically assigned to him by virtue of his talent.
Speaker 2: Well, one gets the impression from what the press says about Tiger, and of course, I met him in the past, is that he doesn't want to be controversial.  From a commercial view point, you don't want to be too commercial they would say because then that might eat into your sales.  I'm just saying that from that particular perspective.  But whether he wants to be a role model or not, he is.  Now he does have these golf, you know, clinics and so forth, right, to try to help minority people be more involved.  I think the controversy has been over the fact that he has not spoken out strongly enough for allowing women into some of these exclusive clubs.  And I think that has upset him to some extent.  But people are saying you have the platform, use it.  And you know in the past, people of color would always, once they got in, you know, would work towards changing things so that people of color could be accepted, you know, into the mainstream as such.
Story_ID: 70093
Speaker 1: I'll just--I'm a just make an aside here.  When I came to Wheaton, Illinois, a suburban town, very few blacks, although blacks have been in Wheaton since 1865 in the Civil War, Wheaton History Museum documents that.  And blacks have been there, you know, off and on through the ages.  I came into town, didn't know, only knew one person.  But my journalism background said get involved in the community if you gonna affect change.  So I got involved politically, I was elected as a committee man, became chairman of the Housing Authority of the County of DuPage for a number of years, and we started a group called CHAD, Community Housing Association of DuPage.  As you know DuPage County, and any county around the country whether Fairfax County in Virginia or Fairfield County in Connecticut, very wealthy, don't want low-income housing.  Okay, the Housing Authority could not give--could not build housing for low-income people.  The vouchers, you could go and find your own place.  Well--so we said, okay, let's do something different.  And so as chairman of the Housing Authority, we worked--I worked together with the people in the group, and we founded that community, the Housing Association of DuPage.  We bought existing housing in all these different communities, including Hinsdale [Illinois], which is very ultra-upscale community.  By the way that housing that we bought in Hinsdale today would be almost worth a million dollars.  But anyway now we owned over 300 units and we're gonna be, we're adding to that housing stock and doing very well. But see nobody can stop us if we buy--just buy housing, now we gonna build some.  But I said that to say this, is that it's important to be involved in the community.  If we have achieved something then we have a responsibility to give back and help people.
Story_ID: 70094
Speaker 1: And these athletes have a responsibility.  In fact, one said to me one time, he said, and he had--he's not a Christian athlete, he's of the Muslim faith, but he came to Christian chapel, and he said, I said, I noticed you have a youth foundation.  I said I'm very happy to see that.  He says well, I'm only doing what you taught us in chapel.  See, I didn't know he was listening.  But he was carrying out what he heard and that's what I like to see, you see.  And athletes, like Michael Jordan and others they have foundations and they're helping people.  It's not always publicized and they don't want it publicized, just do it, that's all.
Speaker 2: And I understand that Tiger Woods is doing--
Speaker 1: Yes, this foundation.
Speaker 2: --Some stuff through his foundation although it kind of says something about you as a person though, quite beyond your talent or your color or your race or whatever, that's not even important.  It says something about your character, when he's not able to respond like to the woman question--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --Like he didn't have--he seemed not to have a frame of reference--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --Not good or bad--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --To be able to deal with those questions, and that's unfortunate.
Speaker 1: That is unfortunate.  But see again, and remember now, what I said, extended adolescence.  You see if you've been--all your life you've been involved in that sport or any sport and that's all you know, when it comes to social action-types of things, you know about 'em but that's not your main concern.  And so suddenly you're thrust into this arena and you feel awkward and even though you know something might be an injustice, well I'll deal with that later because I got to concentrate on the game, see 'cause that's your focus.  So the psychological aspects of that says that people can get so enamored in whatever they're doing sports-wise till they leave off things that are actually more important and--but I do think he's a caring individual.  It's just that he needs to be more vocal about things like women in these clubs and these--in fact before of course blacks were not allowed and you know and of course his father is black.  So those are some of the things that people criticize some athletes for.  But as I say some of them are really doing some things and he is doing some things too.  So just to keep a balance, you know, but we would have hoped that he would have spoken out on the women issue.
Story_ID: 70095
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about the TV before I--tell me something about your television and other media experiences.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, again while working at Urban Ministries [Inc.], we were approached by the owner of Channel 38, if we would be interested in doing a program focused around community issues.  Now I had no background in television, even though I was a journalist, but I had no television experience.  So he said to come up with a format so I developed a format and proposed it to him and he liked it.  It was during the time when you had to have public affairs programming.  So I came up with a name they called it Metroview.  It focused upon issues of--that the community would be interested in and also interview well-known persons too.  I can get their input about issues and various areas to do book, have authors on, I mean, in a sense it was, I guess it was, kind of pre-dated the Oprah type of show, but not doing you know, very, very controversial things.  But anyway we started that show, and we covered a wide range of things like people repairing your house and then taking your money, and don't finish the job and do a shoddy job, expose that or we would deal with you know, we could deal with racism, anything, but we also dealt with (unclear) who came in, for instance, I learned that the Chicago Tribune was very instrumental in getting [President] Abraham Lincoln elected because they were promoting him.  I had no knowledge of that.  I just assumed you know, no, that they really promoted him.  And of course he became president.  Then--but this is one thing that happened to me that I never envisioned in my life.  I think most people never envision this unless they are in a certain category.  One of the local public relations agencies sent me a memo concerning a person coming to town--very worldwide known person, and I think only a few journalists, I mean, electronic media would be invited.  Okay, I called in and they said, yes, they invited me and would I come.  Well, this person was in town to be--for a fundraiser for a cultural institution in Europe.  So, we go to the Drake Hotel, the British Consulate people are there, you remember the media there those have been invited and in walks the late Princess Margaret, and as protocol would have it, the member of the royal family greets you first, that is protocol.  Now of course journalists don't always know about this, but that's how you do it.  And I remember her coming to me, she says, I see that you're in television, now what do you do?  And I explained for that.  She says, how marvelous and she took her--she had a long stem cigarette inside of a holder and she would puff on it, you know, and the smoke would gather and the ashes would accumulate and there was a lady in waiting behind her and as the ashes accumulated, she would flip her royal ashes and the lady in waiting would catch them.  I said, interesting, and of course she was a very outspoken person, but I never thought I would meet a member of the British Royal Family that close.  So, again, something not planned but by being in television and we got two Emmy award nominations for our program, we also were asked to be on the committee to evaluate the Emmy award nominees for out of town stations, whether they were in Minneapolis or St. Paul, or Milwaukee, whatever.
Speaker 1: How long was your show on, what year to what year?
Speaker 2: It was from '79 [1979] to '81 [1981], something like that, about, yeah.
Story_ID: 70096
Speaker 1: And it was--and then--but since then I've been back as a guest on programs on TV [Channel] 38 and co-hosted with the--one of the anchors there, the March on Washington.  This was the one with the Promise Keepers.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And we did a five-hour presentation.  What they did, we would--here in Chicago [Illinois], we would talk about the Promise Keepers and invite people to call in then we would switch to Washington [D.C.] see parts of the March and we'd come back again.  We did it for five hours, and it went by very fast.
Speaker 2: What do you think of the Promise Keepers?
Speaker 1: Well, I think--
Speaker 2: Are they still around?
Speaker 1: Yes, they are.  Bill McCartney a former football coach had a great idea, to get men together, men of faith together, to let them know that they should be serving God and that they have a responsibility to their families and to communities, etc.  He was criticized by some people.  Say well, it's just anti-woman.  But actually it was not anti-woman, he would say men you need to get together and just like women need to get together to do whatever they have to do.  I think some people said, well, you know, where are the black men, well, black men eventually did come into that move[ment] because that's what he desired, he said to us--
Story_ID: 70580
Speaker 1: Okay, the Promise Keepers, please pick it up there.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The Promise Keepers are a group of men of the Christian faith dedicated to God and also helping their families and their communities, being a positive influence.  And yes, it is a predominantly white organization but that's in a sense immaterial because the purpose of that is that men would come together around the common faith in God so that they could glorify God in their lives.  People were saying, but where are the black men?  Well, black men began to come into Promise Keepers as the leadership in that particular group but reflect African American and other you know ethnic groups, and Bill McCartney, the founder, did just that.  The--one of the vice presidents is African American and some of the staff members.  Dr. McCartney, I should say, Coach McCartney, was very clear about this, he says God told him if he did not involve African Americans in this particular ministry, the ministry would not be blessed.  He said this out of his own mouth, he said it in front of an audience and he reiterated that to me and to others.  A very godly man, a man who understands the racial climate in this country.  It's unfortunate in America everything has to have a racial overtone at some point.  Now, we met at Soldier Field, over 70-some thousand men were there together.  It was a very hot day.  I'll never forget that it would have been so hot.  But the messages were very compelling.  The whole thrust was, you know, men serving God and racial reconciliation.  That was one of the very important platforms that was there, and I should never forget, one of the gentlemen, who was a white South African, came and spoke to the group and he told the group, he says, you know, it's common to hear the very fact that on the part of white Americans that well since I was not involved in enslaving blacks, it's not my fault.  He says as a white South African, and I hear you say that, he says, but let's just look at it this way, if in fact you continue policies that are in the racist--or participate in the system like that, he says, you are, in fact, responsible.  He says as a white South African, I'm responsible too for what happened to the blacks in my country under apartheid, even though I personally did not do it, but I'm part of that system.  I gained the benefits from that.  And he says you then must repent for them.  And it was very marvelous to see that our white brothers came out of the stands and did just that.  And many of them hugged other blacks.  It was a very moving moment.  I don't know how widely publicized that was, but it was excellent, because he blew--he just blew the hole in that.  He says, if you're receiving the benefits and you are supporting a system that does that then you are still continuing on that which your ancestors started.  And he should know because he is a white South African, he was under that.  But he was a very compelling speaker and the Lord just moved.  It was real--I sense a real sense of reconciliation now.  And it's something that needed to be highlighted, you know.
Story_ID: 70581
Speaker 1: But I think that our country now, as I said, is coming from the South and coming to the North and getting involved in community as we have, and my wife [Effie Soles], obviously, is very much involved.  She is a person who just as I said earlier, wins people over, regardless of the ethnic group, whether it's in Japan or whether it's in Africa or whether it's in Israel, by the way in Israel.  Tell you about that, in Israel.  We go to Israel and the person who invited us took us to a reception center that tourists as a rule do not go to or don't know anything about, they don't even know it's there, but this was a special group.  These were ministers that we had gotten together, plus a baseball player from the Pittsburgh Pirates.  Anyway, we go to the reception, and there were the Ethiopian Jews.  Now in the Jewish culture today, you have really two main groups, in terms of ethnicity, the Ashkenazi Jews and the Sephardic Jews.  The Ashkenazi Jews are by and large, Eastern European Jews, German, Poland, whatever, and they're the more wealthy of the two groups.  The Sephardic Jews are Jews from Asia, Africa or people of color and you have these two groups, and both of them come together in Israel.  The Ethiopian Jews, who are obviously Africans, and are called Phillosians(ph.), when the Israelis were going into the motherland, they felt guilty that they didn't try to get the Ethiopians.  So they brought them in.  So the Ethiopian Jews get there, and the rabbi said, well now you have to go through the rituals like we go through.  And they said, we have been Jews all our lives, we are descendants of Solomon and the King of Sheba, and you telling us that we have to go through your rituals, no.  We are already Jews, we have been Jews.  You're from Europe, we were from the original tribes, the ten tribes--twelve tribes, see.  And so--so that was a conflict.  And interestingly enough here in Chicago [Illinois], several years ago, the--I think the head of the Israeli tourist office here was an Ethiopian Jew, a lady, you know, so that shows, you know, the progress there.  But while in Israel we were at this resort on the Sea of Galilee.  By the way we're on the Sea of Galilee and the captain says, Reverend Soles, you know, why don't you get behind, you know, the thern(ph.) here and guide the ship.  So guided the ship and you know that felt good, but the thing was and immediately we went to this hotel.  And the Israeli guide said, ah, Soles, Reverend Soles, you play the piano, here's a piano.  Bring out the piano.  Start playing, the lady of the group, she sang, and we sang for about, was it, about an hour, and the Israelis joined in and it was a great time.  In fact the owner of the hotel says, ah, I want to hire you both.  We said, well obviously, we can't stay.  But we had a great time and with the Israelis and the group and everything, it was, everything be--and then I was invited to go up to the Northern part of Israel to be on a radio station, this was from during the time they were having the fight with the Lebanese.  And my wife says, well, if you go, I have to go too.  I said, well, I better not go,' cause I don't want to put you in any danger, 'cause it was dangerous.  And we went into different booths where the people live, and we did all of that.  But it was a beautiful experience for us.
Story_ID: 70582
Speaker 1: Have you-- Did you participate in the Million Man March?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't.  I did not.
Speaker 1: What did you think of that event?
Speaker 2: Well, again, I think that the aim was to bring together men, particularly African American men, to work together and to support their families and to support people of color.  I think the aims were good, but I did not participate.  I had gone--I had gone on the other march, I felt you know that's where I belong, because I think that--that really brought real social change.  I think it was a good statement 'cause I mean, I didn't go to the Promise Keepers march either, I just report it, so I didn't go to either march.  But the aims and objectives of the march by and large I think I would support, yes.
Story_ID: 70583
Speaker 1: Okay, let me, let me ask you this, what do you consider your greatest accomplishment up to now?
Speaker 2: I would say that of course marrying this marvelous woman, the wife [Effie Soles].  But I think, as she said to me before I left this morning, she says, you tell them I said you are a caring individual.  I think just being able to share whatever I have with other people to try to empower them to be all that they can be and share with them the good news of the Gospel of Jesus Christ so that they could grow in their relationship with God and make a difference in the world.  I'm just trying to be a light to others and show them that despite having handicaps or despite being raised in the part of the world where you were told that you're nobody, that you could overcome that.  And you could help others overcome whatever difficulties they have through God and through Jesus Christ and that--but it's more import to love others as you want to be loved, do unto others as you do unto them.  My first thing is love God, you know, and love others then I can genuinely love myself.  But if I try to love myself and don't love God and others, then it's a selfish life, yeah.
Story_ID: 70584
Speaker 1: What do you think you will be remembered for or what would you like to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: That's hard to say because when you've been involved in a number of things, I know over in DuPage County [Illinois], where I live, in 1989 we did the sesquicentennial of the county.  They asked me to be involved on the committee and so I did the memorabilia segment.  And what we did, we went to the county courthouse--county building and they put our names inside of the cornerstone there.  So a hundred years from there, what was it, 1989 then somebody will see a name, I don't know what they'll know--think about the name, but at least--at least they will know that someone who loved God and loved people passed this way who happened to be a person of color.
Story_ID: 70585
Speaker 1: And I--that's something else that triggered my mind.  A few years ago the Ku Klux Klan announced they were gonna come to Wheaton [Illinois] because it's where the County Courthouse is and they were gonna hold a march.  You cannot deny them the right to hold a peaceful march.  So they came.  Most of the people in the town ignored them.  The clergymen of the town and women of the town got together for a pre-rally as well as some government leaders to denounce racism.  NBC came out to do a segment from one of the churches to show the solidarity of the people of that community against racism.  So we went out to the county building where they, the Ku Klux Klan had a march and I got Hispanic brothers, they got together, the mariachi band and they were just--every time the guys started speaking and they would drown them out, they started singing and you know, playing instruments, so nobody heard them.  So it showed a real solidarity of the community, you know singing, we are against these tactics that the Nazis, you know, espouse.  I was very proud of my community for doing that, to show.  But I think what it brought up too was people felt that it's time to even ask forgiveness for any past wrongs, and some of them did.  And to me, that's when I know people really feel and appreciate what you've gone through and say, I'm sorry.  One of the hardest phrases in the world for some people to say is, "I'm sorry", but it's healing when you say it.
Story_ID: 70586
Speaker 1: Is, is that what you think reparations would accomplish?
Speaker 2: It would say that because it says--because America really is deficit to those of us who come out of the slave, you know, out of slavery, never said, "I'm sorry" because history shows that it was a commercial venture.  We were cheap labor brought over through the middle passage and treated horribly, horribly.  That was our holocaust, but America's never said "I'm sorry".  That hurts.  The very fact that we as African Americans are able to accomplish what we have accomplished in spite of all of that, says something about us. That our ancestors are very strong people, and we have inherited that and we must carry on that legacy and never give up.  Continue to strive for freedom and to support others in quest for a full human hood, I'll put it that way to coin a word, yes.  Whether it's our Indian brothers or Hispanic brothers or any others who feel that they may be treated as second-class citizens and to our white brothers, we love them too because we're all one in humanity.  And I think when we understand that that if a bomb drops, it's not gonna say black bomb, white bomb, Hispanic bomb, it's gonna get all of us as the World Trade Center showed, right, so we're all in this together and we must work together, united we stand, divided we fall as a people.  But you must show justice and inside of this thing, you must be just to our neighbors.
Story_ID: 70587
Speaker 1: Okay, your life has been relatively easy.  You like all of us have had your challenges--
Speaker 2: Oh, and how.  I didn't go into those.
Speaker 1: --And I imagine your greatest one is staying the course of your faith--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --As you try to get through this life.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: And that's usually a great one for most of us.
Speaker 2: Right.  And that's exactly right.  Tell me.
Speaker 1: I mean do you have a challenge you want to share with us before we close?
Speaker 2: Well, the challenge always is how can we get people to understand what their purpose in life is.  Were we created just simply to come on earth, accumulate things, have a good time and just do our thing and forget about other people, no we're not.  God has a specific purpose for each of us, and it's up to us to find out what that purpose is.  We were created by God to glorify him first of all.  And then to reach out to others at a sense of community.  And in doing that it makes us understand that each person is significant, has a purpose in life.  And do unto others as you have them do unto you, and you gotta love life, but some people are always complaining about what they don't have.  But they should be thankful for what they do have.  And even in America, even though as people of color, we experience a lot of negative things.  When you go in some other parts of the world you see even worse things.  And so we should be grateful for what we have but always striving to make change.
Story_ID: 70588
Speaker 1: Your childhood which was a good one for an African American child--
Speaker 2: For an African American child, right.
Speaker 1: --Yeah, it was a good one.  What things stand out in your memory as far as sights, sounds and experiences of childhood?
Speaker 2: When you ask a question as direct as that and in this context of which I'm working today, you try to reflect back.  So many things happen, you know, what can I pull up from all of this in my childhood.  It's hard to say at this moment, because I've done so much talking, but, but keep in mind when I say the childhood, you say the childhood was--it wasn't easy but you see the thing that I could say that really had a profound effect negatively on me was my uncle being lynched.  Imagine someone that is a relative of yours being beaten to death and no one--and the authorities did nothing about it.  It was a--lynching was the common thing in those days.  If you--if you were lynched, that's the word for killing, that's it just one less nigger is what they said to contend with.  And imagine the psychological damage that does to you when you're related to that person.  And nobody cares.  The authorities did nothing, were not going to do anything and imagine the feeling that I had when I realized that's what happened.
Story_ID: 70589
Speaker 1: How old were you then?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was about six.
Speaker 1: Six?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I remember that as clear as day.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what you thought at six when you heard that story about your uncle?
Speaker 2: Oh, I mean, you feel, you feel a sense of, of, how can I explain that.  It probably wasn't six, I'm sorry, it's probably eight years of age.
Speaker 1: How old?
Speaker 2: Eight. I felt a sense of revulsion and pain.  I mean, how could they do that to him, he didn't hurt them.  He didn't do anything to them.  He did nothing to deserve that.  And then--then you heard about, well, since you're black and, you know, and you're no good.  You go to the store and I remember that going to Mr. Benefield's(ph.) store, you know, and you, penny candy, and stuff like that and you're watched very closely, of course you know, you know.  And you always had to say, yes um, no, ma'am, no sir, na sa, no sa, yes um.  I mean, I always say that, 'cause if you didn't say that, you know, who are you talking to, you know.  You say yes um to me or yes ma'am to me or yes sir to me.  Always put down.  And even though you can't fully assess what that means, you know that these are boundaries that somehow you are not as good as somebody else, based upon somebody else assessment of you.  That was not easy.  I didn't grow (unclear), I'm trying to do that now.  That was a very painful, and hatred was inside of me, yes it was.  I hated white people because of what they did to my uncle.
Speaker 1: How old was your uncle when he was lynched?
Speaker 2: My father didn't tell me how old he was, but he must have been, I would say, probably in his forties.
Speaker 1: He was an older brother or younger brother?
Speaker 2: A younger brother, I believe he was, yes.  And, I mean, but just that.  I mean, and you carried--in fact, this has been written about another story, it was done some years ago.  I went into that, you know.  I mean, how dare they, and I was very angry and as you grew you--that's why when my conversion to Christianity came, see, I could deal with the area of forgiveness.
Speaker 1: So you had to work on yourself--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --With that raw anger?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Resentment?
Speaker 2: Exactly.  So, and interestingly enough now, of course many of the people that I minister to, you know, I prefer African Americans but also, my white American brothers and sisters.  I mean I go, see so, I can deal with that.  But then, I mean, it was how dare they do that to my uncle.  And I knew why, 'cause it's obvious.  When you grow up in the South, it's so obvious nobody should tell you, you know it.  Now you, now look when the--when a white woman walks on the street, now you make sure you get on the other side, you know.  All of these social things that were then in effect.  And then when I went back to the South later on after I had been up North, I went down to--near Montgomery [Alabama] and so it's a little town called Midway, Alabama, and then you follow an enterprise.  I went to the store, and the lady said something to me, I says yes, and said something else, I said, yes.  She said, you must be from the North, ain't you?  I said, yes.  Now, when I was younger I would not be able to say that, of course.
Speaker 1: It felt good?
Speaker 2: It felt good to say that.  See if you have not been through that you see, it's like somebody being under communist rule and suddenly you are you know freed from that.  But it's by faith that took me through that--that dilemma and helped me to see all people as people that God made and that I cannot judge entire groups by what a few do.  That I must deal with individuals.
Story_ID: 70590
Speaker 1: And really not that many years after your uncle was lynched we had the Emmett Till story and you were about his age, I would imagine?
Speaker 2: At the time that--
Speaker 1: Emmett Till, you remember him?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Oh, do I.  In fact I--
Speaker 1: You were probably about his age, give or take a few years, right?
Speaker 2: Well, not at the same time.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Right.  Because see I think I was--I think I am--how old now--would be, 'cause I met his mother and talked with her and they did a play in Aurora [Illinois].  He was in the--I think he did his in the '50s [1950s] wasn't it?  Was that the '50s [1950s], I think.
Speaker 1: Very late [1955].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So mine was like in the '40s [1940s].  See because see--
Speaker 1: Yeah but it was like a decade or so when you were--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --And you would have been about his age, give or take a few years, right?
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  I'm just trying to--you know those--it seems like ancient of days now.
Speaker 1: I'm only pointing it out because here is another incident very much like your uncle's experience and now you're that age--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --That must have been a little uncomfortable?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Were you very aware of him, personally aware of the Emmett Till situation?
Speaker 2: Only when I read about it.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: I mean that--
Speaker 1: And you heard older people talking about it?
Speaker 2: Oh, that was--
Speaker 1: What did you think of that?
Speaker 2: --Oh, it was hori--
Speaker 1: Did that bring up visions of your uncle?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, right, it was horrible.  I mean it was horrifying.  You see, yes and anytime I hear that it brings to bear that feeling of just how horrific that was, you know.
Speaker 1: Would you name it so that we'll know what we were talking about, the Emmett Till case.
Speaker 2: Oh, the Emmett Till case.
Speaker 1: I mean I want you to name how horrific.  You had the response but we didn't hook it on anything.  And they won't hear me, they'll only hear you.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, yes, the Emmett Till case was very horrific because it made me think, of course, what happened to my uncle, who was lynched by a sympathizer of the Ku Klux Klan and this was a similar type of thing.  A northerner going to the South, by the way, and being accused of, what was it whistling at a white woman or being something like that and killed.  And my uncle was beat to death.  I didn't tell you how it was done because it's hard for me to relive that, but he was beat to death and, unmercifully.  Sorry, never had a chance, and nothing was ever done about it.  And that's the other thing, there never can be closure because nothing was ever done about it.  I mean real closure, yes.  In my mind, of course, it's over, but I'm saying real closure would have said, the thought is we'll try to do something about it, yes.  And as our friends, our Jewish friends were talking about the holocaust as being something that have--to live on and on and on.  So this type of thing that happened will live on and on, even though I have dealt with it, but the fact that it occurred should never occur again, yes, yes.  It's very hurting and--but it was very common in the South at that time, very common.
Story_ID: 70591
Speaker 1: Did they-- Was your uncle's situation one of those recreational beatings and lynchings that we've heard about from the South or did they have a pretext for this action?
Speaker 2: Yes, the pretext was that he owned land adjoining to a white family's land and they said some cattle were missing and that he must have taken the cattle and was no evidence to that at all, but since he was black and the cattle had been stolen, so the assumption was that he did it, and they took the law into their own hands based upon what they thought it to be and they killed him, and they beat him to death.  And the way my father described it, well, I just really--it was just so horrible and whether it was Emmett Till or some others in the South who were hung by, you know the neck, by the way, it also happened in the North.  Indiana (unclear) example, something happened there.  I think, Munster, one of those towns and in other parts of the North.  So that's a part of history people don't like to revisit because it makes them uncomfortable.  But if you gonna deal with truth, you gotta deal with that which is uncomfortable, otherwise you can never rectify it.  And so I have no problem in mentioning it because it's true.  So, yes, on one hand, I sure had a very supportive family, but when you have a traumatic experience that's, that relate to you, it does affect you and only God can take that away from me, really, otherwise, I would have probably turned out to be other than what I am today, you know.  Very frankly, I mean I could have just gone the other way, but God, that's why I praise him and I love him because he came into my life at a very critical point in my life.  So that when that happened, I could go to New York's Times Square with my Italian friend and Jewish friend and another African American, we could preach in Times Square to the masses of people moving across the, was then called the cross roads of the world then we could go up to Harlem at 125th Street and speak up there, then we go on to Wall Street and do the same thing, as a team.  So it was like kind of a microcosm of America, you know, Black, Jewish, Italian, you know.  And we worked together as a team.  I remember one time on Wall Street one of the, well this is the Jewish brother, he began the speak and was talking about Christ of Jesus and one of the people in the audience there on Wall Street was lambasting him because--
Story_ID: 70109
Speaker 1: You said, they told him you're a Jew, what are you doing here?
Speaker 2: Right, that's what they said to him and of course he was trying to continue to speak.  And I said, bro, to him, I whispered to him, I think I better speak in your place, and I did, and of course they backed away, obviously, being tall, African American man, you know.  And so they respected that.  But they were harassing him because of the fact as a Jew, and I think some of them were Jews, they didn't think that he should be talking about Christian things, particular about a conversion.  But this team of two African Americans, a Jew and an Italian, we were part of, we would call a gospel team that were in the New York area.  So we went to Times Square, as I said to Harlem and to Wall Street carrying that message, and we displayed our unity by working together collectively and that was a telling statement, I think, to everybody.  They couldn't believe it, but that's what it was about.
Speaker 1: Who were you working for?
Speaker 2: We were just doing this as a ministry, different ministries that we had, we just combined to do that outreach on the streets of New York, yes.
Story_ID: 70110
Speaker 1: Tell me what you think your legacy will be or what would you like your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Well, that he lived, he shared the good news of the gospel to people, he was involved in his community and he tried to enrich the lives of other people and that he is--that he loved people that he believed that God is real because of what he went through and God brought him through that God is real--not only does he believe but he knows--he knew that God was real and that encourage other people that in spite of the challenges and obstacles in their lives with faith in God you can overcome anything.
Story_ID: 70111
Speaker 1: Is there anything that I did not ask you that perhaps I should have or is there any comment you wish to make?
Speaker 2: There are indeed some things but I'm trying to think of what they are.  After this it's going to be a little difficult.  My mind is racing.  I think when the city that I live, the city of Wheaton [Illinois], chose me as citizen of the year, last year, it was a very moving moment for me because you are in a town that has some number of outstanding citizens, some of whom have gone onto national fame.  One of them is Mr. [Edwin] Hubble of the Hubble telescope fame, Red Grange, ball player of the [Chicago] Bears and Dr. Billy Graham, of course, was in college, and people of that persuasion are all outstanding.  There are a number of, in fact, John Drury of Channel 7 and just a number of outstanding people.  So to be considered the citizen of the year in that city in itself is a significant honor and I certainly treasure that.  But I think that travelling to Japan to Africa to the Middle East to--across America and then to France, those are highlights for me because it gave me an opportunity to interact with people of various cultural, religious and ethnic backgrounds and to--because both my wife [Effie Soles] and I love people.  And without her help, I would not have been able to achieve some of the things that I have achieved.  She is my partner and she is talented in her own right.  She is a minister and she is a woman who is a teacher, role model and I think I'm very blessed to have her as a wife.  And I feel very humbled by that.  And to have parents as I've had, both of whom, of course, have gone on to be with God, loving and raising me to be what I am today.  Without their help I could not be here today.  And then there are a number of friends of various races and backgrounds who have made an imprint into my life.  I've learned from them, been inspired by them and I appreciate the fact that they walked into my life and added to that life, so.  And I want to thank you for allowing me to share these moments--to talk about my life as an African American in America and some of the struggles we go through which, shall we say, some of the trials and tribulations and the triumphs.  Thank you so very much for that privilege.  And as I said earlier too that not only have--meeting British royalty, but presidents and other distinguished persons, I never thought when I was that little boy in Alabama that I would ever have the privilege to meet these great people, and yes people think of me in various ways but a lot of them kind of put me in this little category, I shouldn't say little category, but this category as a chaplain for the Chicago Bulls, so therefore you know Michael Jordan, so therefore you know you must be great, but that is not really the reason.  Michael Jordan calls me Pastor because of respect that he has for me.  And one thing that I do, I don't care who you are I'm going to treat you as a human being, I'm going to tell you the truth, and that's what I try to do in a loving manner.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much.  We have really appreciated you giving us the time and sharing your life and experiences with us.
Speaker 2: Thank you.  It was a pleasure, really a pleasure, yes.
