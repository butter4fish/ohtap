Speaker 1: All right, my name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer with The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, could you please give us your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Sure, Julius Wesley Becton, Jr.  Julius is just like in Caesar.  Wesley is W-E-S-L-E-Y.  Becton is B, like in boy, -E-C-T-O-N, Jr.
Speaker 1: And, sir, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Twenty-nine, June, 1926.  Place of birth is a place called Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, two words.
Speaker 1: Okay, it's B-R-Y--
Speaker 2: B-R-Y-N, M-A-W-R.
Speaker 1: Okay, Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania.  And that's on what they call the mainline, right?
Speaker 2: That's on the mainline.  There's a small girl's school there named Bryn Mawr College.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and, sir, what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: I'm a soldier, I was a soldier for almost forty years.  Title started off as being Private, ended up as being General.  I've had four other positions in which they all have titles.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, you can--
Speaker 2: You want me to--
Speaker 1: Sure, go ahead, yeah.
Speaker 2: After I left the [U.S.] Army, I went--after a year I became Director of Foreign Disaster Assistance and Agency for International Development, AID.  I then became the director of something called FEMA.  This is the FEMA before Katrina [Hurricane Katrina], not after, Federal Emergency Management Agency.  Next title I had was President of Prairie View A and M [Agricultural and Mechanical] University in Texas, my alma mater, and the last position, as such, was Superintendent, D.C. [District of Columbia] Public Schools, the most difficult job I ever had.
Speaker 1: You're not the first one to say that either.
Speaker 2: I understand, believe me.
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.  So, all right, and in the Army you were, you retired as Lieutenant General, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, now, what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Say that again, please?
Speaker 1: Sir, what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is the 26th of August, 2012.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: You're located inside an agency or organization called "The Fairfax".  It's one of the armed forces' retirement community.  It's in Fort Belvoir, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay, and we're in the community room, I believe it is, right?
Speaker 2: You're in the community center.
Speaker 1: Center, okay, all right.
Story_ID: 34214
Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we ask as sort of a warm up.  And they only require a short answer.  The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Do I have a favorite food?  My family would say, yes, liver and onions.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: Baked beans and coleslaw.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Yes, you're wearing it.
Speaker 1: Okay, yellow.
Speaker 2: Yellow.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Only because my organizations I've served in, in the [U.S.] Army have been calvary-type units.  That's our color.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: (Chuckle) Not really, but if I had to pinpoint one, it'd be the fall.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I haven't taken one of those in a long time, but we probably spend more time in a place called Aruba with the family than any other place.  Several of our family members have time share there.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the last question is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: A favorite phrase or saying?  I probably do, but it doesn't come to my mind right now.  We--could be "Get it done" or "Thank you."  I'm sort of big on beating up on my family, but thanking people when they do things for them.
Story_ID: 34215
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, but we'll separate them and put 'em together at the end.  So can you first tell us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Her first name is Rose, R-O-S-E, Inez, I-N-E-Z.  Her maiden name was Banks.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born the 10th of October, 1900 in Caroline County, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: They were farmers basically.  My mother went as far as tenth grade because in the county in which she grew up, black Americans could not go beyond that in the public schools.  I knew my grandfather, her father.  I did not know my grandmother.  My grandfather farmed a little bit, tobacco, cucumbers, some corn, all the things that convinced me that I did not want to become a farmer when I grew up because I used to go to that part of the world for two weeks and do what my grandfather asked us to do.  We rode the mules.  There were no horses there.  Or he did not own any horses.  Let's put it that way; and dirt roads, outdoor plumbing, well water.  It was rural, country.
Speaker 1: Now, what was your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: Round, spelled just Round, R-O-U-N-D, Banks.
Speaker 1: Is there a story about his name or how he got the name Round?
Speaker 2: I, there may well be.  I do not recall ever hearing it.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Round Banks, and do you know when he was born?
Speaker 2: Say that again?
Speaker 1: Do you know his birthday?
Speaker 2: I do not.
Speaker 1: Okay, I would imagine, maybe 1880 or 1870s or 80s [1880s].
Speaker 2: Oh, he was before 1880 because Mom was 1900.  I would put him probably in the 1840, 18--somewhere between 1830 and 1850.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he would have been alive during slavery then?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, he was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did he have any stories about slavery that he shared?
Speaker 2: No, as a matter of fact, my grandfather shared very few stories about his background, his growing up.  And my mother did not, either did not know or did not tell us anything in those days.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, as far as you know, was the family centered in that area of Virginia from the time--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --of slavery to--
Speaker 2: As far as I know, they were centered there because they owned property there, so--which meant they accumulated the property after slavery.
Speaker 1: Okay, is there a story about how they accumulated property that's told in the family at all?
Speaker 2: It may well be, but I don't know it.  The community is there today.  We have relatives who came from there.  Quite a few have been very successful, but as far as going back, and I'm sure some of our cousins can come up with stories.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, was your--could your grandfather read or write?
Speaker 2: Yes, he could--rudimentary.  I can truthfully say I don't recall having seen any books in his house.  But he could write because he could sign contracts.  He could sign for the property because we have signatures of that.  But that's the extent that I'm aware of.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 34216
Speaker 1: So your mother [Rose Inez Banks] went to the tenth grade?
Speaker 2: Tenth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did she share any stories about growing up with you herself, about what it was like then on the farm and, or any aspirations she had that she wanted to do, you know, when she was growing up?
Speaker 2: No, she grew up as a quote "country girl," working, going barefooted for a lot of her growing up time.  And she got a deep-seated church background which she passed on to my brother [Joseph William Becton] and myself.  She left that part of Virginia and went to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] in the early '20s [1920s].  Her aspirations, I think, may well have been to either have a family and teach or teach and have a family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was a--took in laundry where we lived.  And she was a rabid athletic fan, baseball, basketball, football.
Speaker 1: What were her favorite teams?
Speaker 2: Philadelphia Phillies [baseball], something called the Philadelphia Eagles [football]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I used that term with a smile on my face because I became a [Washington] Redskin [football] rooter.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She--we had a cousin who was one of the better tennis players, Ora Washington, and she also played basketball with the women's basketball--black basketball.  In my mother's pastime, she loved to play pinochle.  That's a card game in case you don't recognize it.  She loved to fish, particularly off the waters of Morehead City in North Carolina.  She enjoyed life.  As a matter of fact, she was--I played football in high school, and my father [Julius Wesley Becton, Sr.] was reluctant to sign for me to play football.  My mother signed, ah, son, where do you want me to sign, and signed right away.  Yeah, that's the kind of person she was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: One other thing I should point out.  She was a very independent female.  She would, on several occasions when--after I was married, and we had to move from place to place or go overseas, she would assist in driving the family back here to the East Coast, as I'd take off for Korea or some other place.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your mother came up here in the early '20s [1920s], you said, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And did she already have any relatives here when she came up or did she come up by herself?
Speaker 2: I, the answer is, yes, she had some relatives.  I could not tell you who they were.  They lived in Philadelphia, and I can't go beyond, I really can't go beyond that point.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 34217
Speaker 1: Now I'm gonna go to your father's side of the family.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: I'm junior.  He's Julius Wesley Becton, Senior.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Date of birth is 7 January, 1897.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Place is Craven County, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: C-R-A-V-E-N?
Speaker 2: C-R-A-V-E-N.
Speaker 1: Okay, Craven County--
Speaker 2: New Bern (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Capital.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what do you, what can you tell us about your father's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: They were, they were slaves.  My father's father, my grandfather was born in 1824, and the only reason I know that because we found his tombstone, and that's on there.
Story_ID: 34218
Speaker 1: He [Becton's father, Julius Wesley Becton, Sr.] had a third-grade education because he had to go to work in the field or whatever.  He is a, a very hard-working person--
Speaker 2: Now, this is your father or your grandfather?
Speaker 1: My father.
Speaker 2: Your father, okay, all right.
Speaker 1: Very sincere.  He, too, moved to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] in the early '20s [1920s], and he had, I think, a brother who preceded him up in Philadelphia.  He, too, was a very religious person.  I said, hardworking and very sincere.  To give an example about his sincerity, he went to work as a laborer on building an apartment in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania as a laborer.  He stayed on as janitor of that apartment, and that in '20s [1920s], 1923, '24 [1924].  And he died as a janitor of the apartment in 1966.
Speaker 2: So the same--
Speaker 1: Same job.
Speaker 2: Same place.
Speaker 1: Same place.
Speaker 2: Built the building and then worked in it for--
Speaker 1: And we lived in the basement apartment.
Story_ID: 34219
Speaker 1: As I said, he [Becton's father, Julius Wesley Becton, Sr.] was religious, but a typical Sunday might, I think, describe my father and mother [Rose Inez Banks].  I, and my brother [Joseph William Becton], went to junior church at 10:30 [in the morning], senior church at eleven o'clock, Sunday school, whenever the minister finished preaching.  It could be twelve o'clock, 12:30, one o'clock, then Sunday school started.  We had a separate communion service on the fourth Sunday, which meant we stayed there for that.  I would then come back to BYPU, Baptist (unclear) [Baptist Young People's Union], I think.  That's at 7:30 [in the evening].  Senior church, evening church at eight o'clock.  As I've described to the chaplains who worked for me, I've had a lot of churchgoing.  I don't think I need that many hours for my soul to be saved, and I don't think anyone else.  So chaplain, when you're preaching, I'm not gonna tell you what to say.  Remember the time.
Speaker 2: Okay, (chuckle).
Story_ID: 34220
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents [Rose Inez Banks and Julius Wesley Becton, Sr.] met?
Speaker 2: Say that again, the first part about--
Speaker 1: Is there a story about--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: --how your parents met?
Speaker 2: Actually, no, and I never asked the question.  They met in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], fell in love and all of a sudden got married and out comes Julius Becton, Jr.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're the oldest of the--
Speaker 2: I'm the oldest.
Speaker 1: And how many siblings do you have?
Speaker 2: One.
Speaker 1: Just a brother?
Speaker 2: Brother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was a year and--he's deceased now, but he was a year and two days behind me.
Speaker 1: And what's your brother's name?
Speaker 2: Joseph William Becton.  And the reason I use the J.R. [junior] even to this day, as a reminder about my father because I didn't have as much appreciation for him as a teenager growing up.  I later appreciated how good he was, what a decent man he was.
Story_ID: 34221
Speaker 1: When you consider your parents' [Rose Inez Banks and Julius Wesley Becton, Sr.] personalities and their dispositions and their talents, the way they look, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: My father, and there are pictures of him in that stack you've got.  But, you know, it's enough, we have some, some of our daughters take a little bit after my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay, in what sense are you like your father?
Speaker 2: In what sense am I like my father?  Well, I'm taller than he was.  He was about 5'4".  I try to have an appreciation for people.  I try to be a person of integrity.  Clearly, I am a churchgoing person.  I mentioned the fact that my mother always signed for me to play football.  My father never saw me play football.  He always had something to do as a janitor.  When he finally saw me participate, it was at a track meet after I graduated from high school.  But I was a long jump, then called a broad jump champion of Pennsylvania.  He came out to see a meet of all the different athletes in the Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] area, all the champions and got some six or seven different conferences and so forth.  And I hurt myself, broad jumping.  And I didn't believe it.  He didn't believe it either, but he never stopped us from going.  But he would take--we went to see baseball.  I used to go to see the [Philadelphia] Phillies play, the (unclear) play and the Philadelphia Stars [football].  The Philadelphia Stars happened to be a black league in the Negro League.  I had the chance to see a guy like Satchel Paige pitch.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He also liked to fish, and I think that he--mom's love for fishing came from him because where she grew up, there was no water except streams.  But down in North Carolina where we used to go for Morehead City, you've got the Atlantic Ocean there.
Story_ID: 34222
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory, like the first thing that you remember remembering?
Speaker 2: Do I have an early childhood memory?
Speaker 1: An earliest, earliest, the first.
Speaker 2: I got it, I got what your question is, but I don't think I--I think the earliest I can remember was wearing a knit suit, going to school, kindergarten.  And why that sticks in my mind, I have no idea, but that I do remember.  I don't think I can back beyond that.  I've never had a question like that before.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know.
Speaker 2: Probably about tomorrow morning, about three o'clock, I'll come up with answer.  I'll call you.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 34223
Speaker 1: Now, can you describe the--now, did you grow up in the same place?
Speaker 2: I grew up in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania in the apartment that my father [Julius Wesley Becton, Sr.] helped build.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We had a basement apartment, two bedrooms, and that's where we grew up.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, I saw the photo in the book of the place, and it looks like a pretty big building.  It was like a court (unclear) way building, right?
Speaker 2: Twenty-four apartments, units.
Speaker 1: Okay, right, so this is a big building, and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and it's on what they call the mainline, right, in Pennsylvania, near Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]--
Speaker 2: Well, the mainline line-
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --constitutes going West out of Philadelphia out to as far as beyond Wayne, probably--well, beyond Wayne, very affluent place, the place that I probably couldn't afford to live there now.  Well, I might but I'd stretch myself.
Speaker 1: Yeah, lots of the old money in America--
Speaker 2: Lots of old money, lots of very, very popular schools, Bryn Mawr College, Villanova [University].  You have Haverford [College].  You have Valley Forge Military Academy [and College], which our son and grandson went to.  We have--I'm sure I'm gonna be embarrassed when I look at this and find I've left out some of the schools.  But there're quite a few.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the role of black people on the mainline is to serve--
Speaker 2: Basically, servitude.  They were servants, very few professionals.  In Bryn Mawr, itself, we had one black physician, one black dentist, two churches and the ministers.  We--I'm talking now back in the 20s [1920s] and '30s [1930s], who were there--one undertaker, all the kinds of professionals you need to keep things going.  But as far as bankers, manufacturers, those types of people, college professors, if they were there, I didn't know 'em.
Speaker 1: Were the schools segregated or did they--
Speaker 2: The schools were not segregated.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not when I grew up.  We--and very good schools, I might add.  I went to Lower Marion Township and even to this day, they're in the top 100 of school districts in the country.  The classes were not segregated, but it was interesting the way that the youngsters were placed in schools.  We used a--where I went to school, an "A" and "B."  "A" were the rapid learners, "B" were the slower learners.  And I pride myself with being in 1-A up through 7-A, except for fourth grade.  I was put in 4B.  And because I lived at the apartment in Bryn Mawr--we were only--if there's, you saw a richy side of the tracks, we were on that side of the tracks, and therefore, most, if not all of the folks of color were on the other side.  And so some of the names I've heard or were implied were not very complimentary.
Story_ID: 34224
Speaker 1: Okay, so the building that your father [Julius Wesley Becton, Sr.] served [in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania] was basically white occupied?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There were no black tenants in the building.  And there were rooms in the basement for the servants of the people who lived there.  And I can truthfully say that the owners had a high degree of respect for my father and respected his judgment, his supervision was almost nonexistent because they said, "Julius will take care of that".  A person come to take a look at the apartment for purposes of renting or buying, he was the first person, he was the one who showed them around.  The interesting part about the apartment, there were twenty-four.  Twelve were owner operated, occupied, and twelve were rental that the company, corporation held.  And if he said that this would be done, the owner said, that's what it's gonna be.
Speaker 1: Now, that's a lot of power on one hand to have, and--
Speaker 2: It is.
Speaker 1: --but it's also a lot of work too.  If he--
Speaker 2: He worked very hard.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He had one assistant janitor who had a room in the basement.  When a decision was made to get a contract for say, bringing in coal, and it was a coal-fed furnace, he was the one to make the recommendation to the owners, and they bought it.  Coming to shovel snow, if he needed help and his assistant couldn't get it all done, he had the authority to hire somebody to help.  Of course, in many cases, it was Julius, Jr. and Joe [Becton's brother, Joseph William Becton] that did the shoveling snow and raking leaves, but that's the kind of control he had.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's, it's interesting.  It kind of shows, you know, you can say he was a janitor on one hand, but then you're saying something else with him doing all this and having--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --all this responsibility.  This is--
Speaker 2: The interesting thing is I, I later appreciated.  In those days, we had icemen delivering ice, milkmen delivering bottled milk, bread men, delivering bread, the kinds of things that you read about now.  But he basically had control of who came in.  And as a result, we always had fresh bread, ice in our refrigerator, bottled milk, daily, at no cost, as far as I know.  And this was the, I guess, the right to be able to control who came in.  And I never saw him beat up on anybody or make any demands.  It was just the way, the bottled milk would appear on a doorstep.  The ice will appear in the refrigerator, and I mean refrigerator with going in--icebox, excuse me, not refrigerator.
Story_ID: 34225
Speaker 1: So you were explaining that your father [Julius Wesley Becton, Sr.], you know, he has powers that go beyond the scope of what people think of when they think of janitor?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So he's controlling the, who comes into the complex?
Speaker 2: Controlling from the standpoint of selling things.  He did.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did he have responsibility for collecting rent or fees or anything?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's done by the corporation, and he showed people the apartments.  He also made sure that anything from a maintenance standpoint got accomplished.  He also ensured that the trash collection, they set things outside their door, that was done.  But he did it in such a manner that he was never domineering.  He was never demanding.  He was a pleasant person, and folks basically liked him.
Speaker 1: Would you consider him like a role model for a management style that you would use later on?
Speaker 2: I would, but I didn't appreciate it at the time.  But I later did appreciate his sense of sticking to a job.  I have described in some of the philosophies I've come up with, one, be professional, matter of fact, the first one I've used.  And I use my father's example.  Being a professional had nothing to do with the profession you're in, but how you go about your job.  Do you do your job to the best of your ability?  My father was a professional janitor.  He did it to the best of his ability, and did it well.  And, but I can't ask for any more than that, and to me, that was a role model to me.
Speaker 1: Okay, it seems like that his personality and management style contributed to the, you know, the development of the family by being able to acquire resources without having to pay for all of 'em too, I guess, you know.
Speaker 2: He did save his money.  His pay was not all that great because we had an apartment, but he was able to buy property, a house two miles from where we lived and rent that house out.  He was always able to have a car.  He was, took two weeks' vacation every year, and on one of those vacations, some of our cousins totaled his car.  And he got on the telephone, called back the, his boss, so to speak, the owner that ran things, told him what happened.  And they said, Julius, go to the nearest dealer and buy a car.  We'll take care of it.  That's the kind of rapport that he had with those people.  And the amazing thing, as I said, he had a third-grade education, but an appreciation for what's important.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he had a good relationship with the people he worked for--
Speaker 2: Yes, he did.
Speaker 1: --because of his attitude toward his work.
Speaker 2: He did, and as a result, we were able, "we" being my brother [Joseph William Becton] and I, to benefit from it, get recommendations for school, and get the support to stick to it.  I wanted to be a medical doctor, and the company owners told him, okay, this is how you do it.  You gotta do this, you gotta do that in school.  That is a little bit unusual for the era in which we grew up.
Story_ID: 34226
Speaker 1: Yeah, now, and what you described was a town [Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania] that had very few black professionals.  But you all lived across the tracks from the black side of town.
Speaker 2: We did.
Speaker 1: So, did you have access to white professionals on the white side of town that could influence and guide you?
Speaker 2: Actually, no.  The best example I can give you of that, there is living today at least two of my high school classmates.  We started in grammar school together.  Matter of fact, one started in third grade educ--third grade, and the other one started in kindergarten.  I never--and the one in third grade lived right across the street in, as a resident of an apartment.  I never was invited to go into this apartment.  We're friends to this day.  He was the president of our high school class, and we communicate, email now.  We exchange Christmas cards.  But you have a certain--that's the way it is.  So, did I have a white mentor in the community?  No.
Speaker 1: And there's a tacit, I guess segregation, customary segregation, I suppose.
Speaker 2: We had that, theater, movie house, Seville Theater is the name of it, now called Bryn Mawr Theater.  During my growing up, black Americans sat in the front, left section.  Now, when you get more people, then they let you come back further and further.  And I have no idea how long that lasted, but it was still going on when I left for high school--when I left for college or left for the [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 1: That's--
Speaker 2: You have a volunteer fire company; never have any black Americans.  Did you have to go into any particular doors?  No, but you didn't go to a bar and get a drink.
Speaker 1: Were public facilities downtown, I mean like restrooms segregated and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Yes, in some cases.  Now, I pause because I haven't thought about that for a long time.  I, when I went into the Army, I went to, among other places, Fort Benning, Georgia, Fort McClellan, Alabama, Kiester Field, Mississippi, and so I grew up where you had black and white doors, signs, water fountains, all the trappings of a segregated, Jim Crow, environment.  But we did not have those kinds of things in Bryn Mawr or in the mainline as a matter of fact.
Speaker 1: You said, but you kind of knew what you could do and couldn't do.
Speaker 2: You knew what you could do and what you couldn't do.  In high school, it was completely integrated, although, I never went to a dance, a prom.  I played football and track.  I was never encouraged to learn how to play golf.  I was not invited to be on the swimming team.  There are certain lines that we knew where we could or could not go.  And it was no big issue because that's the way it is, so.
Speaker 1: Is that because of the social aspects of golf and swimming--
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: --recreational, outside of the high school sports?
Speaker 2: I think so, yes.  There were no signs saying you can't play golf.
Speaker 1: But you didn't (laughter)--
Speaker 2: But, sort of like Augusta [National Golf Club] and women.  Of course, that changed now.
Speaker 1: And just changed.
Speaker 2: Just changed.
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is what?  2012 and--
Speaker 2: Proof is in the pudding when they see what happens next year (laughter).

Speaker 1: So we always ask this question.  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sights, sounds and smells in the area, in the community?
Speaker 1: Or even on vacation 'cause you were, you spent some time in the summer in North Carolina and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  First in Bryn Mawr [Pennsylvania], we have the beautiful, the wonderful smell and sounds of spring; birds and tulips and flowers.  It's a very affluent area, community.  You had the, I was, our apartment was one block from the Bryn Mawr railroad station.  And I still recall the sounds of the chu-chu going by.  And, of course, they later developed into electric trains going by.  Sounds, church bells, and we had a lot of churches in the area.  There were, early on, horse-drawn wagons for, as a matter of fact, milk was one of them.  You had the sounds, what happens when a horse had to relieve himself.  The later in life visiting to the South, Virginia or North Carolina, I even can recall, when you crossed the line from Maryland to Virginia, you had to go through an agriculture inspection to make sure you were not bringing in some forbidden plant or whatever that may be.  You had to, your car got inspected, not just my father's car, but all cars.  I remember the smell of being on a farm, which as I said earlier, convinced me I did not wanna be a farmer.  And the smell of an outhouse, and our paper we used was Sears Roebuck catalog.  That thick catalog with the very, very rough paper.
Speaker 1: I've heard that, I've heard it said that--so how do you use that catalog paper?  I mean--
Speaker 2: You tear it, you rip a page out, rub together and use it.
Speaker 1: Okay, you kind of soften it up a little bit first.
Speaker 2: That's when you rub it together.  Hey, that's all you had, so you make do with that.  The other, during that period, I can recall the night pot that would be used in the house, that you'd relieve yourself, and then you'd take it out in the morning.  Other sights and sounds, cows and pigs and those kind of things, all of which contributed to my not wanting to become a farmer.
Story_ID: 34228
Speaker 1: But did you kind of experience your parents [Rose Inez Banks and Julius Wesley Becton, Sr.] in a different context when they were, when they went to North Carolina.  I mean did they--
Speaker 2: No, basically, they were still the same people.  They didn't put on any airs up in the North as opposed to down there.  My father was very successful, perceived to be very successful because he had two sisters, one older and one younger than he.  And each of them had--one sister had sixteen, seventeen children.  The other one had eight or nine.  And when we would come down, we were the, coming from the North, we were--got our own car, that type of thing.  And he was well regarded.  That family, particularly, North Carolina, we still assemble the first week in August.  I didn't make it this year, but it's the kind of a family that get together to relate and reflect on, I would say, war stories, but there were--my father had two sisters and a brother.  And I am the oldest member on the Becton side.  There's one older cousin than I, and he lives in Maryland.  He's two years older than I am.  And, but it's the kind of a family that enjoy getting together and enjoy each other.  Also, we had, they enjoyed--my father was a, well, not a drinker, but he would have a drink of beer.  When he went to North Carolina, he would also, a relative would give him a bottle which may be known in certain places of the world as corn, North Carolina Corn.  Was it licensed?  No.  Was it packed by an inspector?  No.  Was it moonshine?  Yes.  But there's no big deal about it.  He would probably bring back one bottle and that bottle would last all year.
Story_ID: 34229
Speaker 1: What was the name of your first school, where you started school?
Speaker 2: First school?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Bryn Mawr Grammar [School], G-R-A-M-M-A-R [Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania].  And it was the old grammar school.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you said it was an integrated school.  Like what was the, how many black students would you think proportionately?  What do you think?
Speaker 2: Oh, I would say that in a--I mentioned, in fact, I was in "A" class, and I and one other person, one girl, were routinely in the "A" section.  The "B" section, a handful, five or six.
Speaker 1: Okay, so a class typically, about thirty, forty kids or--
Speaker 2: Less than that.
Speaker 1: Less than that.
Speaker 2: They were concerned--we talk about the size of class now.  It was living proof that you didn't need forty and fifty people in a class.  We would have--twenty-five or thirty would be a large class back in those days.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you and the African American girl were the only, well, only two in the "A" section?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you might be 20 percent of the class or, you know, or so, I guess, maybe or 10 percent, (unclear), it depends on--it's not 10, but--
Speaker 2: Two out of twenty.
Speaker 1: Yeah, two out of twenty, yeah.  So, but in the "B" section, how many--what would be our--
Speaker 2: There were, I said, about five or six, seven or eight, depending on what level we're talking about.
Speaker 1: Okay, so about three times as many of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, one of the things which I didn't mention about school, and I'm very proud of it.  As a matter of fact, I don't think I put that in my autobiography, but from the kindergarten through seventh grade, I missed two days of school.  And I have certificates, a certificate with seals for each of those years that I went to school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I felt that was something that, I was rather proud of it.  My mother [Rose Inez Banks] was delighted with it, I was going to school like that.
Speaker 1: Did your brother [Joseph William Becton] have a similar record?
Speaker 2: No.
Story_ID: 34230
Speaker 1: Joe [Becton's brother, Joseph William Becton] was interesting.  At a point in time when he was about fourteen [years old], he ran away from home, between fourteen and sixteen, probably three times.  And I later realized that he perceived that I was getting all the good things and he was not getting those things.  But interesting enough, he got his degree from college before I did.
Speaker 2: Okay, where did he go?  Where did he go to school?
Speaker 1: He went to Shaw [Shaw University, Raleigh, North Carolina] for his undergraduate and which is interesting how he picked Shaw.  He looked at the--this is after the war [World War II], and he was in the [U.S.] Navy.  He looked at the catalog and found out that Shaw had more girls than any other school that he could go to--Shaw.  I told the president of Shaw that when I got to be at that level.  And he said, Ahh.  No, that's why he went there (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, he'd just come out of the Navy, right, so he was--
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was, matter of fact, he came out of the Navy, went back to finish his high school because he joined the Navy before he graduated.  And he had a significant emotional event to happen to him in San Diego [California], that he ended up in the brig by drinking too much, raising hell and getting in trouble, bam, in the slammer.  And that taught him a lesson about drinking.  I think that he could truthfully say that he was not a heavy drinker after that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 34231
Speaker 1: Now, in grade school, now, you were in Section A with the brightest kids or those perceived to be the brightest kids in the school.  Did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: Favorite subject?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Grammar as a matter of fact, and we had grammar as opposed to English, two separate courses.  And I got to the point I could diagram a sentence in a heartbeat, and--don't ask me to do it now, but I could then.  Another thing would have been social studies, civics, which was a separate class.  Even though I wanted to be a doctor, I did not have a, any great love for the sciences.
Speaker 1: Why not?
Speaker 2: I guess you could ask why did I want to be a doctor.  That might explain it--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because, to me, that was the epitome of black success.  We had one doctor in town which I got to know quite well.  And that was a role model, and I wanted to be a doctor.  And I worked towards that.  I did not work towards that in chemistry or in physics.  I did fairly well in biology.
Speaker 1: Now, did you like math at all?
Speaker 2: I, my degree from Prairie View [A&M University, Texas] was a B.S. [Bachelor of Science degree] in mathematics.  But let me point out how that happened.  I had, it took me a long time to get my first degree.  I took my first college course in the Philippines in 1946.  I got my degree in 1960.  I went to Muhlenberg [College, Allentown, Pennsylvania] right after I got out of the [U.S.] Army for two years before I got recalled to active duty.  And then I started taking three hours here, six hours some other time.  Any chance I get, correspondence course or courses in nearby institutions, I took advantage of it.  At Muhlenberg, I was taking a course in analytical geometry--no, yeah, analytical geometry.  And on the day of the examination, final exam, which was a day before I got married, I flunked it.  I was doing great, A, up until that time.  And I just flunked the exam.  After my wedding, I came back to school and the professor, the instructor, "Come on in here. Now, I'm gonna give you a C even though you flunked the exam because I think you understand the subject.  But what you've been doing, you've been memorizing and not understanding."  And he told me, and that was to be my last math course until I got to Prairie View.  I left Muhlenberg in '48 [1948], and went to Prairie View in 1957.  I had to pick a major at Prairie View, and I said, what about natural science?  We don't have a degree in natural science.  Well, here's my transcript.  I had more hours than I really needed, but no major as such, and no--all the classes that I had taken could not be accepted in Texas.  They wouldn't accept at the school, history--Civilization of History, History of Civilization.  They wouldn't accept Bible classes, and I had--Muhlenberg is a Lutheran school.  Those were not acceptable.  I'll point out later that I changed that when I became president.  But the only courses I had that would lead to a major was math.  The one I said, oh, no, not that.  And so I finished and got my degree in math.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 34232
Speaker 1: Well, let's go back to--I'm gonna take you back to grade school, and we'll kind of remember some of this as we go forward.  But, now, were there any special teachers in grade school, in grammar school?
Speaker 2: Yes, one.  She was a third-grade teacher, and in those days, your teacher was also your homeroom--you could have a homeroom teacher who could be your teacher too, homeroom, being that's where you spent all your time.  And, of course, in grammar school, they taught everything, that one teacher.  Her name was Reese, R-E-E-S-E.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And what did she teach basically?
Speaker 2: Well, she taught the whole thing from--
Speaker 1: Oh, everything, okay, that's right.
Speaker 2: --but she was basically--I later found out she was an English major, which I think sort of helped me to understand grammar.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the system there in Bryn Mawr--now, do you have middle school?
Speaker 2: Middle school?
Speaker 1: Yeah, or junior high school or what?
Speaker 2: Yes, that was in Ardmore.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We went, and by the way, we didn't have middle schools in those days.  We went from grammar school through seventh grade, eighth and ninth was the junior high school, tenth, eleventh twelfth were the senior high schools.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: And that junior high school was first, Lower Marion Junior High School.  And then they changed the name to Ardmore Junior High School.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you went to basically, you started off at Lower Marion, but they changed it to Ardmore?
Speaker 2: I think it changed the year I left and went to high school, senior high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what about junior high school?  Did you have a--did your interests change any in junior high school?
Speaker 2: I think it became more refined because there I was serious thinking about college, even though I was in junior high school.  I did well in political science.  I did well, as I recall in, of course the basic subjects, English, math and history.  But I also did well in biology.
Story_ID: 34233
Speaker 1: Now, you're working with your father [Julius Wesley Becton, Sr.], right, for--did you have any other jobs growing up?
Speaker 2: Growing up, yes.  We earned money, my brother [Joseph William Becton] and I, by delivering things into the apartment to the residents.  They would pull up with a car, and we'd unload 'em, take 'em up, get a tip.  I, early on in, I guess 15, 14, 16, I used to work for one of the doctors in the community.  He had a--two servants inside, woman and man, and I was his outside person, cut grass.  Those kinds of things that the, very proud of myself, with twenty-five cents an hour.  And that was money in those days.
Speaker 1: Right.  That would be the equivalent of getting, well, minimum wage now, you think or maybe--
Speaker 2: I've never considered what the minimum wage was.  I don't think we had minimum wages back in those days.
Speaker 1: So that, that twenty-five cents might be equivalent to what five dollars now?  Is that too much?
Speaker 2: It might well be.  My father's salary was--he got paid twice a month.  I wanna say fifty dollars every two months--
Speaker 1: Every two weeks?
Speaker 2: Yes, every two--excuse me.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, so that's--
Speaker 2: And that may be high.
Speaker 1: And so, but he got his, the living quarters were paid for, he didn't have to pay for rent?
Speaker 2: No, we did not because that was part of the contract.
Speaker 1: Now, did that include heat and utilities too, you know?
Speaker 2: The apartment.  He had, if the apartment had heat, we had heat.  So it was a central heating, no air conditioning in those days.
Speaker 1: So fifty dollars, it could--
Speaker 2: I think that's right.  Let me rephrase that.  It's thirty-five dollars now that I think about it.
Speaker 1: Really, thirty-five dollars?
Speaker 2: Thirty-five dollars every two weeks.
Speaker 1: Ghee, yeah, that's--
Speaker 2: But that was adequate from the standpoint of what we had.  As I said, he had a car.  My mother [Rosa Inez Banks] was never hurting for money to go shopping.  Our entertainment in those days, every Thursday, my father was off.  And we would go to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] to the theater, movie house.  I mentioned about going to a baseball game.  So we were comfortable, and we never had to worry about--when the [Great] Depression hit, we always--my father had a job.  We had the milkman delivering milk.  We had the bread man delivering bread.  We had ice for our refriger--icebox.  So it, when you add all the things, they were a lot more than that perceived thirty-five dollars.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Story_ID: 34234
Speaker 1: Saints Memorial Baptist Church, Saints.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Just like "Saints" floating around, "Memorial Baptist Church" on Warner Avenue in Bryn Mawr [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Now, from what I've read in the notes, you had a positive relationship with your pastor, right?
Speaker 1: With whom?
Speaker 2: With the pastor of the church?
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.
Speaker 2: And what was his name?  Reverend--
Speaker 1: J. Arthur Younger, a very good relationship with him.  Matter of fact, one of his grandchildren and I are still friends today.  She lives, she's married, obviously.  They have their own family.  And we still swap stories about that.  Reverend Younger is the one who baptized me.  He married Louise and me.  He baptized Louise.  He baptized, I think, two of our children.  And he was the kind of man that encouraged us, whenever we came back to Bryn Mawr after marriage and so forth, stop by and see him.  And we would.  Interestingly enough, when I was in France, the youngster who I mentioned that she's still around today, she was dating a [U.S.] Army officer, and he asked them to stop by and see me in Verdun, France, asked me what did I think about the young man?  I gave him my approval and so they got married and one of those stories that every once in a while I remind Jackie, remember now, or Bill, hang in there (laughter).
Speaker 2: So, now, did you have like any special roles in the church?  Were you--
Speaker 1: Yes, of sort.  I was a, during the war, World War I--II, before I entered the service, we established a newsletter for our service boys, as we called them, with hometown news, and we'll send it to them, I think monthly basis.  And it became quite popular.  And we'll share letters with the congregation when they send to us and post it on a bulletin board or circulate it.  Growing up, we were active in plays, performances, something that our church was deep into, youngsters getting involved.  And we got to be pretty good.  We probably put on a performance, probably two performances a year, two different plays.  I can't, off the top of my head now, think of anything else that we were doing.
Speaker 2: Okay, well, were they plays written by the church members or were they--
Speaker 1: Written by, no, they were written by some--mostly, I guess the producer found these things in the market or in commercial.
Speaker 2: So do you remember the name of a play--
Speaker 1: I do not.
Speaker 2: No, okay.
Speaker 1: I have no idea.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 34235
Speaker 1: Now, you were involved in sports.  We kind of touched on that a little bit, but when did you, when were you discovered as having like athletic ability?
Speaker 2: I started in grammar school.  They didn't play football in grammar school because you could get hurt.  So they played soccer and softball.  Got to junior high, went into football.  And we had, I might point out, in Bryn Mawr [Pennsylvania] we had adequate playgrounds and so we played football on the playgrounds after school.  But I played, I was pretty good.  Junior high, I was junior high for eighth and ninth grade, and it so happened that the coach in our junior high team moved up to senior high at the same time we did.  And so I had a leg up on kids coming from other schools in the senior high school.  I played both ways, center and linebacker in football and track, short distances, 50, 100 [meters].  A rare occasion, I'd run a 220 [meters] and if I can get away (unclear), never run a quarter of a mile.  But my strength was in, as I said, broad jump, now called long jump.  I won the state championship in 1944.
Speaker 1: So you were state champion in the long jump?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, that's a lot--you're competing against a lot of fellows from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and other big--Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] and every place else, I guess.
Speaker 2: As I said, we had a combined track meet in which I got hurt about a week after I graduated from high school.  But we had the Philadelphia league, the Catholic league, the public schools in suburban Philadelphia, and then the military schools.  It's quite a competitive area.  In football, I was on the--our team, in the three years, I played football, we had one tie and lost one.
Speaker 1: That's quite a record.
Speaker 2: And on the All-State team for football, I was a runner up to, oh, boy.  I think it's Chuck Bednarik, I believe, but I wouldn't--
Speaker 1: Oh, he's a legend in football.
Speaker 2: He ended up going to the [Philadelphia] Eagles [professional football team], and the Hall of Fame.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's, isn't the one that put this devastating hit on Bart Starr or somebody, or Wyle (ph.) Tittle [unclear] or somebody in a championship game or something.  Chuck Bednarik, he was, he had a reputation as a--
Speaker 2: He was a hard man.
Speaker 1: As like, almost like a killer, you know, because of this hit he put on--
Speaker 2: But I, I delight that in my senior year, I (unclear) honorable mention, Lake, in his position, center.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Never met him, but I did have a chance to play against a future Hall of Famer, Emlen Tunnell, who was a super, super person.
Speaker 1: Now, he was a back, right, I believe--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Emlen Tunnell--
Speaker 2: He played for Radner [High School], the school that--our arch rival.
Story_ID: 34236
Speaker 1: And interesting story about that, my wife, future wife went to Radner High School [Pennsylvania].  And I got to know her when I guess I was a junior, and she was a junior.  I was dating one of her class--friends, and all of a sudden something happened, and we were dating each other.  She didn't like me very much because I, I probably was obnoxious and bragged about--
Speaker 2: Well, why did--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --beating up on her team [football].
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: So, and she'll tell you, well--okay.  But she was one of those eggheads, went to school and did very well, went to Mercy Hospital, graduated nursing program.
Story_ID: 34237
Speaker 1: Now, at this time, now, you projected yourself as being a doctor, right?
Speaker 2: I, during that time in high school, I project myself as a, wanna go to medical college and become an MD.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you, now, you are--when the war [World War II] starts, you're sixteen years old, right, 1941?
Speaker 2: 1941, I joined the Civil Air Patrol.  I joined the [U.S.] Army in December, 1943, Army Air Corp Enlisted Reserves.
Speaker 1: Now, tell us, what is the Civil Air Patrol?
Speaker 2: Basically, one, they had classes which we had navigation classes, classes in aeronautics.  I got my first ride in an aircraft in a Piper Cub in the back seat.  And in those days, I wanted to become a pilot more than I wanted to become a doctor.  And it wasn't until I got caught up by physical examination that determined I had 20-25 vision.  And you need 20-20 to see.  You couldn't wear glasses as a pilot in those days.  And I was--I knew I had a problem with my left eye.  And I got to the point they had those big charts which you may have seen, big letters and small letters and smaller, you bring in and sit in a chair like this.  The charts on the wall, been up, stationed to the wall, cover your right eye, cover your left eye, and read.  By the time I got to that point, I had memorized that chart.  And I had it down.  And it was not until I was on active duty down at Keesler Field, Mississippi, for pre-flight training, they took me into a darkened room, no chart on the wall and projectors like that camera was behind me, lights are out.  Cover your right eye.  Then they project the screen on the wall.  Now, read that bottom line.  And that's how it got picked up.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was not until--that was 1944.  It was not until 1970 that the Army had changed their rules a little bit and were bringing in their senior officers who had done well in combat in their history, to learn how to fly.  And you could wear glasses and have a 20-25 vision.  I was one of those guys.  They said, okay, you wanna be a pilot.  We know you got wiped out one time.  You now can go to school.  At the same time they told me this, I was coming out of National War College for my next assignment.
Speaker 1: We may be going too far now.  Let me go back a little bit before--
Speaker 2: Okay, but I finally got a chance to go to school, flight school, and I turned it down because I had a chance to command a unit.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that command was more important than being a flying--pilot.
Story_ID: 34238
Speaker 1: All right, now, we had you back in 1941 at the outbreak of the war [World War II].  Now, did your family discuss, you know, world politics or racial issues in the home?  Were political discussions--
Speaker 2: Not really.  What they did, one--where is Pearl Harbor?  Geography, and who did the attacking?  Japanese.  But as far as politics, I cannot recall any discussion about politics in my family.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did your parents [Rose Inez Banks and Julius Wesley Becton, Sr.] vote?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, did they--
Speaker 2: I said--that was a quick, yes.  My father voted.  My mother did not vote.  Matter of fact, I don't think women could vote then.
Speaker 1: They could.  Actually, they got the vote in 1920, though I don't know how many people were aware of it either way.
Speaker 2: I do not recall my mother voting.
Speaker 1: Okay, I think--
Speaker 2: And interestingly enough, my father--the reason I know my father voted because he, we talked, not a great deal, but he was a Republican.  Why was he a Republican?  Well, the management of the Bryn Mawr Corp Apartments, they were clearly Republicans.  It was Lincoln [President Abraham Lincoln] that freed the slaves, Republicans.  And in those days, all good things that came to us, came from Republicans.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and there was a much different feeling about the Republican Party--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, because when I registered--I think I can get to that, when I went to Muhlenberg [College, Allentown, Pennsylvania], I'd already been accepted at Lincoln University in Oxford, Pennsylvania.  And I got a call from my coach, football coach a week before I was supposed to go to school in Lincoln.  How would you like to go to Muhlenberg?  Where is it?  Allentown, Pennsylvania.  Why?  Well, on a football scholarship, and they got the best pre-med course you can find, pre-med.  Okay.  So I decide, yes, I'll do that.
Story_ID: 34239
Speaker 1: I wanted to set up the war [World War II], and then get you in the [U.S.] Army first--
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: --you know, before we got you coming out of it.  So in '41 [1941], you hear about the War.  You're sixteen years old.  You enlist in the Civil Air Patrol, and--
Speaker 2: I wasn't sixteen in '40 [1940].
Speaker 1: '41 [1941].
Speaker 2: '41 [1941], yeah, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, when Pearl Harbor, you know, goes down.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.  I said the start of the War, but the U.S. entry into it was in 1941, after Pearl Harbor.  And so, you're sixteen years old.  And did you--had they started looking for black pilots for Tuskegee Airmen at that point or did you have--
Speaker 2: Not in 1941.
Speaker 1: But you had it in your mind that you wanted to be a pilot?
Speaker 2: Yeah, because the senior instructor at Tuskegee came from Bryn Mawr [Pennsylvania], and I knew him, Chief [Charles Alfred] Anderson.  He was the one that flew Eleanor Roosevelt [First Lady; wife of President Franklin D. Roosevelt] for an airplane ride.  And he was the kind of a person that you sort of looked up, a real hero because he could fly.  And it wasn't until, I guess, '42 [1942] that I developed an interest.  And, hey, that's pretty neat.  And as I say, I joined the Civil Air Patrols, and got a chance to ride in the back of a Piper Cub.  I also participated in the Civil Patrol auxiliary police.  I wore a uniform, and we, in case the bad guys were to attack our country, we'd be there to help, not to show what we could do because we carried wooden rifles for training and dismounted drill.  But that was part of--I wore a uniform then too.  So this idea of wearing a uniform came pretty early.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you actually joined the Army Air Corp Enlisted Reserve in '43 [1943], right?
Speaker 2: December 28th, 1943.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 34240
Speaker 1: So at the time, you were still in high school--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --playing football at Lower Marion High School.
Speaker 2: Playing football, Lower Marion High School.
Speaker 1: Now, this is--Lower Marion High School that people hear every time the [Los Angeles] Lakers [basketball team in Los Angeles, California] play 'cause Kobe Bryant [basketball player], you know, went there too--
Speaker 2: Kobe Bryant went to the same school.
Speaker 1: Same school.
Speaker 2: Matter of fact,--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous) later--
Speaker 2: --there is a--he built a gymnasium.  It has his name on it at Lower Marion.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I saw it about two months ago, three months ago.
Speaker 1: Okay, I just wanted to say that because people watching this--
Speaker 2: Now, that you said that, let me drop another name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Al Haig, that name ring a bell, Al Haig?
Speaker 1: Yes, right, right.
Speaker 2: Four-star general, Secretary of State, Lower Marion graduate.
Speaker 1: Okay, Alexander Haig.
Speaker 2: He was a four-star.  Larry Summers, that name may or may not ring a bell?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's one of the--
Speaker 2: He was president of Harvard [University].  He was the economic advisor to the president, the current president [President Barack Obama].  He's a Lower Marion graduate.  Hap [Henry H.] Arnold.  Hap was the first Chief of Staff of the Army Air Corp.  And he is the reason that I wanted to fly because he came out to our high school when I was a junior.  He graduated many years ago, gave a long song and dance about join the Army Air Corp, win your silver wing and gold bars.  And six of us went down to take the exam--six of us went down to be sworn in, in December of 1943.  And that really probably did more to my desire to fly than anything else because--and I delight in telling you the current Chief of Staff of the Air Force, whenever I see them, hey, I've done something you've never done.  What are you talking about?  I've shaken the hand of Hap Arnold.  I know damn well they hadn't.  So.
Story_ID: 34241
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you--in 1943, now, did you--you didn't leave the United States, did you?
Speaker 2: '43 [1943]?
Speaker 1: In '43 [1943], right.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were here, and received training.  Now, how did you--I see here that you went to Officer Candidate School.  Is this in '44 [1944]?
Speaker 2: That's in '44 [1944].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: December of '44 [1944].
Speaker 1: So, along with sixteen other African American candidates completed officer candidate school.  So it was a fairly large class of African Americans sent to OCS [Officer Candidate School]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had 200, I think started in the class, total.  And that was at Fort Benning, Georgia--Columbus, Georgia.  And the interesting part about that, and a lot of people did not realize it, while the South was completely segregated, inside ROT--inside OCS, we were integrated, accommodations, sleeping, eating, everything, integrated.  One foot outside that area, you're back to the segregated South.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so this is a big contradiction.  The [U.S.] Army--this is prior to the desegregation of the Armed Services?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, this is World War II.
Speaker 1: The official desegregation, yeah.
Speaker 2: But all Army schools were integrated.  Like I said, not too well-known.  But they were.
Speaker 1: Okay, and Georgia was (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, by any means was Georgia (unclear)--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Georgia was still in the grips of Jim Crowe [segregation laws].
Speaker 2: I've had the typical problems of any black American walking through portions of Georgia.
Story_ID: 34242
Speaker 1: Now, were those experiences [of segregation], I guess they were difficult, I guess to take as a young man, right, coming out of Pennsylvania, going to Georgia and--
Speaker 2: Well, as I've described to people, my first duty station after I was inducted, Keesler Field, Mississippi.  What a great place for a black American teenager to go to in 1944.  I tell a story that a very good friend of mine who also flunked out of pre-flight, were downtown in Biloxi, Mississippi.  And we were walking down the street and two young privates in uniform, and all of a sudden, we heard a loud noise.  Somebody saying, there are them!  And turned around, the guy is in an open pick-up truck coming down the road on, actually on the pavement.  And if we had not flattened ourselves against this storefront window, they would have hit us and kept on going.  We left back to Fort--back to Keesler Field as fast as we could.  Fast forwarding for a brief story.  The next time I was in Biloxi, Mississippi, I was coming back as a lieutenant general.  I was met at the airport by the state adjutant general.  I was escorted to a hotel where I was speaking by this adjutant general and motorcycle escort, walked in, up on the stage, and I said, "My, how things have changed," as I told the story about the last time I was--so, yes, I have been through some pretty interesting, challenging things in the South.
Speaker 1: So change is real over these years?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, the changes are very real.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and even though things are not perfect in Mississippi or Ohio or Pennsylvania, there, things have changed.
Speaker 2: While there's change and they're real, we've still got some challenge today.
Story_ID: 34243
Speaker 1: So now, so you spent the balance of the war [World War II] here in the [United] States.  And at a certain point, in 1946, you decided to just, to separate from the [U.S.] Army, right, and get out?
Speaker 2: I didn't decide.  The Army decided--
Speaker 1: Well, your time was up.
Speaker 2: I was able to--yeah, I was able to get out in '46 [1946], and I went--I was in the Philippines at the time.  I had taken a college course there, and I had sufficient accumulated points that I could be separated, not discharged.  But I stayed in the Reserves [Army Reserves].  And--
Speaker 1: Okay, so when did you--when were you sent to the Philippines?  What year was that?
Speaker 2: That was 1945.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Oops, back up a little bit.  In 1945, I was sent to the Morti, which are islands South of the Philippines, North of New Guinea.  And when our division deactivated in December of '45 [1945], I was sent, along with some other youngsters to the Philippines.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so this is your first time living overseas, right?
Speaker 2: This was my first time living overseas.
Speaker 1: Okay, and this is, the Philippines were, I guess, a major, you know, I guess station for the--what would you call it?  A staging ground, I guess, for U.S. operations in the Pacific, I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, it was also--you know, they had their independence at that time too.  They'd been under the rule of the Japanese, of, yeah, Japanese, but, so that you understand some of the environment, it was in Morti that I first experienced what the natives thought about black Americans.  They had been told that black Americans have tails.  And that's when they would come behind and look at, you know, looking for our tail.  And who were they told this by?  Our white brethren.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's interesting.  That's, yeah, so this, this is--I've heard that story a lot from the GIs over there.
Speaker 2: I can guarantee you that I've had that--I experienced that.
Speaker 1: So, yeah, it's a common thing that occurs over there--.
Story_ID: 34244
Speaker 1: So in 1946, you stayed in the [U.S. Army] reserves, but you were discharged.  You could go--
Speaker 2: I left--I was separated from the military--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in October of '46 [1946] and enrolled in college, as I said, in Lincoln University, in Oxford, Pennsylvania, but never got there because I was offered a chance to go to--as the first black American to go to Muhlenberg [College, Allentown, Pennsylvania].  And at that time, I might add, my--a guy I played football with in high school [Lower Marion High School, Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania], he had been become a Tuskegee Airman, and the two of us--he got separated the same time.  We managed to go through all of our terminal leave pay by having fun.
Speaker 1: Now, what is this gentleman's name?
Speaker 2: James R. Williams, James Robert Williams.  Today, he's a medical doctor.  He went to, as my book points out, he lived with us in Bryn Mawr Courts Apartments for a year primarily because he wanted to continue to play football at Lower Marion, and his parents lived, not in Lower Marion.  So my mother [Rose Inez Banks] said, bring him, come on over here.  So he lived with us.  He became the second black American to go to Muhlenberg College.  He went up there on a football scholarship as did I.  But he did go to medical college.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you play football?  You played, right?
Speaker 2: Did I play football?
Speaker 1: Yeah, at Muhlenberg?
Speaker 2: I entered on a scholarship.  I played one Spring practice, one Spring period.  And I got hurt.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: The coach had the view that in Spring practice, we're gonna put these kids to--not kids, these guys through hard training.  And we were out there for two, three hours in the afternoon, and back under lights [unclear].  And I injured my shoulder by having shoulder pads that were two small, and I got a pinched nerve.  And that took care of my football scholarship and my stipend of thirty-five dollars a month.  I was also, had the VA [Veteran's Administration], the GI Bill of Rights.  And so I really didn't need the thirty-0five dollars.  I said, didn't need--I could use it, but I didn't.  And that took [unclear] my football scholarship and football playing.
Story_ID: 34245
Speaker 1: Okay, Muhlenberg College [Allentown, Pennsylvania].  This is a Lutheran school, right?
Speaker 2: Lutheran school.
Speaker 1: So in football.  I just wanted you to explain 'cause athletes watching this have no idea what you all were wearing in those days.  Now, you didn't have the helmets they have today, right?  You--
Speaker 2: Oh, no, we had leather helmets, leather helmets, which means that if you hit somebody, there's nothing to cushion that between you and your head.
Speaker 1: And a piece of, I mean the leather was about the equivalent of a baseball mitt type leather or something or what?
Speaker 2: That might be harder than your baseball mitten, but that's it.
Speaker 1: Okay, it wasn't much on your head.
Speaker 2: No, and the face guard, I didn't have a face guard.  And the ones who had face guards had a nose thing that the gum part, coming between your teeth and it fits like that.  But it doesn't, when somebody hits you in it, your face, your teeth and everything else know that you've been hit.  And as a center, depending upon whom we were playing, the opposition would think nothing about, as I'm centering the ball, they're reaching up, throwing dirt in my face.  But I had, in high school, some pretty good guards.  When that happened, they took care of that person.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.  Okay, so you were playing, were you still playing both ways?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So this is something that people are not used to either, playing offense and defense.  You're playing center on offense--
Speaker 2: On offense, and linebacker on defense.
Speaker 1: Linebacker on defense.
Speaker 2: And I'm happy to say that, fast forwarding many, many years, my Julius Wesley Becton, IV, a junior in high school, captain of his team, playing both ways.
Speaker 1: Now, it's interesting too 'cause I remember, I remember this from reading old sports magazines that Chuck Bednarik, the guy you said who is the top player in Pennsylvania--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that you were just behind.  Chuck Bednarik played both ways in the pros.
Speaker 2: He did.
Speaker 1: He was the last person to do it in the pros, both ways.
Speaker 2: Well, it got to the point now, you know, at one time, you're concerned how many people you can carry on your team, how many you can substitute.  They would check you off, but that became history.  And they wanted to get the best they could.  So a guy who played both ways, these days is a--you're not gonna find many in college and certainly, none in professional football.
Speaker 1: Right, that's right.  It's just too tough.  So, okay, so you got hurt in Spring practice.  This is--
Speaker 2: Spring practice.
Speaker 1: --in 1947, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: 1947.
Speaker 1: Twenty-one years old.  And so they took your scholarship away, and--
Speaker 2: I was a student.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it just--so you just played, you still--you continued in school in the GI Bill?
Speaker 2: I continued playing, particularly in track, but nothing else.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: No other sport, that is, in college.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right--
Story_ID: 34246
Speaker 1: And I, to be honest about it, I was dating a young lady [Louise] who was a nurse in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  Allentown is some distance from Philadelphia, and I was driving, and I had other things that were important besides football.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, okay.  So, you got married in 1948 too, right?
Speaker 1: 29 June, 1948.
Speaker 2: Now, this is to Louise, the young lady that was a scholar that you were going with, who was studying nursing--
Speaker 1: A young lady who did not like me when I was in high school.  But she mellowed.
Speaker 2: Okay, how did you win her over (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Say that again?
Speaker 2: How did you win her over?  I mean how did you change her mind?
Speaker 1: It was very simple, being the decent guy that I am (laughter).  No, actually, we enjoyed things together.  I had a Ford Coupe convertible when I first met her that I--on my .25 cents an hour I used--I paid $125.00 for that car.  And in the summertime when she was not in school, my girlfriend, her friend, was working.  And we would take her to work, and then Louise would get in the rumble seat when we'd take her to work, and when Gwen went off to school, class--or work rather, get up in the front seat.  And then we'd go out and have fun and then go pick up Gwen.  She'd get back in the rumble seat.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can't do those things these days.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay.
Story_ID: 34247
Speaker 1: All right.  So now, the [U.S.] Army was integrated in 1948, the same year you got married, by President [Harry S.] Truman,--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --signed Executive Order 9981.  And you returned to service that same year? I requested a recall to active duty for several reasons.  One, the integration helped to make it a considered option.  Two, I'd just gotten married.  Three, as soon as--I'd just got married, but I got married in January.  I came back in '48 [1948], and we were expecting our first child the first week in December, and we'd already bought a home.  So I got a house, house payment, expecting a child, no football stipend.  And you can't really raise a family and pay mortgage and pay for a car and a house on the money we had available.  My father [Julius Wesley Becton, Sr.] had helped me as necessary.  And by the way, the down payment for that house was made possible because my mother [Rose Inez Banks], when I first got commissioned as a second lieutenant, convinced me to put some money into a savings bond.  She did it this way.  How much money are you making now as a second lieutenant?  I told her, $150.00, Mom.  How money were you making?  Ah, $50.00.  Okay, put a hundred dollars in--mom, I can't, look.  Put a hundred dollars in a savings bond.  I was going overseas anyhow.  I did.  That money I put in became our down payment later in 1948 when we bought a house.
Speaker 2: So, wise parents in terms of how to manage money.
Speaker 1: Just another one of those examples what that woman and my father did for us.
Speaker 2: These are interesting examples of management that your parents are setting.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: So, okay, so, now, did you come back in as a second lieutenant?
Speaker 1: Came back as a second lieutenant because I had been promoted to first lieutenant in what they called "terminal leave promotion."  When I got out before, we got promoted one grade.  When we got recalled, they lowered us back to the grade that we served in, which was a second lieutenant.  And I came back with the understanding that I could compete to become a regular Army officer, regular Army being a permanent officer as such, sort of like tenure versus non-tenure in a college.
Speaker 2: Okay, so what was the first step towards that?
Speaker 1: First?
Speaker 2: First step towards becoming a regular officer?
Speaker 1: That was to be assigned to a unit, be evaluated for a twelve-month period and have four evaluations during that period which are a little bit of a large number, but four separate evaluations.  And they took 1,000 people at the time in this competitive tour.  And we were competing against each other.  It just so happened that about halfway through my competitive tour, Korea [Korean War] occurred.  And we went off to fight a war, and there's no better way to prove what kind of officer you are than in wartime.  I had that opportunity.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 34248
Speaker 1: So this is the Korean Conflict which is often called the Korean War.
Speaker 2: Yeah, people talk about the Korean Conflict.  I was in a war.  Conflict to me is a mental thing.  We were being shot at.
Speaker 1: And they call it the "conflict" because--
Speaker 2: Because of what?
Speaker 1: I think it was never declared by [U.S.] Congress.  I think that's the reason.
Speaker 2: Well, that's right.  Tell me the last time we had a war declared by Congress?
Speaker 1: Probably, World War II, I think.
Speaker 2: That's it.
Speaker 1: Is that it?
Speaker 2: That's the, just one.
Speaker 1: Okay, it's, yeah, it's interesting.  I mean we learned in social studies classes that only Congress can declare war, but I've lived through all the wars in my lifetime that have not been declared.
Speaker 2: Even Grenada (laughter), for a brief time, you don't hear about a Grenada Conflict.
Speaker 1: Right, and it wasn't really much of a war either, but it was, you know--
Speaker 2: I'm a simplistic person.  When somebody's shooting at me, and I'm shooting back at them, that's war.  No matter how you pretty it up--
Speaker 1: Oh, Korea was horrific on a large scale.  I don't know what, if you experienced any of the really horrible stuff over there, but it was--I mean there were all kind of stories.  So what happened to you in Korea?  What kind of--
Speaker 2: I went over in a unit in the 2nd Infantry Division.  I ended up by getting two wounds.  I was in North Korea when we got kicked out--an absolute retreat by the United States military.  The only thing that saved me was the fact that I got wounded a day before my unit got chased out.  And I had been evacuated from the area.  My battalion that I was in ended up by having five officers to come out alive at that time.  Either they were killed or captured.  And if I had remained behind without being wounded, I would have been either one of those KIAs [killed in action] or captured.  In addition to that, the wound that got me evacuated occurred in my left Achilles' heel area.  You have a tendon down there.  The bullet went between the tendon and the ankle bone, did not touch either.  So when people say, "Hah,"--yeah, thank you Father, because those are the kind of things that have been true throughout my life.
Speaker 1: At age eighty-six, I might point out to anybody watching this, you're a very lively man who can walk, fairly quickly, and, you know, it's un--despite being shot through the leg, lower leg, I guess?
Speaker 2: Well, the alternative is do what?  Crawl up in a corner and die or stop doing anything?
Speaker 1: Okay, some people can't help the alternative, but--.
Story_ID: 34249
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about the--now, was the [U.S.] Army, in your opinion, in those days--because I heard so many stories about World War II, about soldiers fighting on both fronts as you well know, the Army being segregated and some of the racial attitudes being so bad that, you're dealing with the enemy on the outside, but you're also dealing with an enemy on the inside of the Army.  How was, when the Korean Conflict, or Korean War started, this was the first time that U.S. soldiers are going into combat as an officially integrated force, right?
Speaker 2: Well, let's put it this way.  We were the first war, it was the first war after [President Harry S.] Truman signed the Executive Order 9981.  We had not integrated.  My unit [9th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division] was still segregated when we went off to Korea.  We had a black commander, battalion commander, but he got transferred before we shipped out, not because of, we're going to war, because he came out on orders before the war started.  And they just continued with the order.  He went to ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] instructor assignment or assignments.  And they brought back a former commander, a white lieutenant colonel, and he took us into combat.  When we arrived in Pusan, Korea, we were the first, state-side unit to arrive.  The division had three regiments, and the regiment I was in had three battalions, one battalion black, the other two battalions, white.  Right before we moved into combat into the battlefield, my battalion, the third battalion, got pulled out from the regiment and sent on a separate mission to guard an airfield.  At the time, we thought, that's strange, but don't--they know what they're doing.  It wasn't until many years later, I found out we got pulled out because some people at Corp headquarters didn't trust black units.  The guy who made the decision, Ned Edmonds, had commanded the 92nd Division in World War II.  And he became the expert on blacks in the military.  And he was of the opinion that blacks could not do well, could not follow orders well, had no leadership ability, a whole bunch of negative things.  And so he had convinced the Corp commander to pull them out, and let's see what they can do on a separate mission guarding an airfield.  It took about three weeks before we got back into the regiment because our regiment got bloody nosed.  They got hurt, and the regimental commander was screaming for his battalion, which was up guarding an airfield.  And we came back about the mid part of August, latter part of August and to rejoin the regiment to give them the strength they should have had.  And on our first major effort, after we rejoined the regiment, we were pushing out at the Pusan perimeter, attacking North.  It was there that I got my first battlefield wound, shrapnel in my right leg, went back to the hospital.  Six weeks later, I rejoined my unit because I had heard McArthur [General George McArthur] say that we wanna be, we're gonna win this war and be home by Christmas.  I did not wanna be in a hospital when my unit went back to the [United] States.  So, I did everything I could go rejoin my unit, and I did.  I rejoined them in November, and that's when we were pushing North, into North Korea.  And that's when the Chinese came into the war, and any hopes of being home by Christmas evaporated.  And we got our butts kicked out of North Korea.
Story_ID: 34250
Speaker 1: Now, this is really by the Chinese, right, you're saying the Chinese came in and--
Speaker 2: Chinese came into it--
Speaker 1: And unofficially, or whatever, but they're the real combatants.
Speaker 2: They, the Chinese had volunteers, as they said, helping the North Koreans.
Speaker 1: So, this is one of the key, hot conflicts of what became a Cold War, later, you know, right?  It was a hot--
Speaker 2: There was nothing cold about that one.  It was a very hot war.
Speaker 1: No, yeah, now, I--just my own personal experience, every black soldier I've met who participated in the Korean War has been wounded.  Was it, so black soldiers were in the thick of the fighting.  My neighbor, my father-in-law, and all the friends I know that were in the Korean War.
Speaker 2: And as I started to say, our regiment was integrated.  Once the regimental commander was approaching--this was in mid-August, by his adjutant or personnel people, "Colonel, we've got replacements coming in" not by any racial group, but by skills, infantry, mortar men, artillery, whatever, where should we put 'em?"  And C. C. Sloan, Colonel, United States Army, said, "Put 'em where they're needed."  And with that statement, the 9th Infantry Regiment got integrated.  And I can remember to this day that I received a non-black coming into my platoon in August, happened to have been a Chicano, but that's non-black.  And I told my platoon sergeant, Sergeant, don't let anything happen to this guy.  We gotta make sure he comes out alive, protected.  So our platoon was integrated with that fellow.
Speaker 1: So, "Put 'em where they're needed" was the key to the integration of the--
Speaker 2: That was our regimental commander's approach, not because Truman [President Harry Truman] said, put 'em there, but because "put 'em where they're needed."
Speaker 1: Okay, and the, you were in the--okay, 9th Infantry Regiment, Second Division, is that it?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 34251
Speaker 1: Okay, so, I know when you read about the Korean War, they talk about the Battle of the Yechon, were you involved in that?
Speaker 2: Battle of which one?
Speaker 1: Yechon.
Speaker 2: I was not.  That took place after we got kicked out, and we started to rebuild up our forces and going back up North, restoring the 38th Parallel, not going back North.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the 38th Parallel is a line that--
Speaker 2: Between, demarcation between North and South.
Speaker 1: Okay, and it's kind of a no-man's land or kind of a space there where there's a standoff--
Speaker 2: That's that area right between the two.  Interestingly enough, our son was operating in that area, his first assignment after he got commissioned, after he graduated from college.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how long were you in Korea?
Speaker 2: We got to Korea, I got to Korea in July, and I was evacuated in May of '51 [1951].
Speaker 1: Okay, so you come back May of 1951.  And you'd been wounded, you said, three times?
Speaker 2: I got wounded twice.
Speaker 1: Twice, all right, twice.
Story_ID: 34252
Speaker 1: So what did you do when you came back?
Speaker 2: First to Fort Dix [New Jersey] as a, still a second lieutenant as a platoon leader, training officer.  I was there for about a two-week period, three-week maybe, and then sent to Camp Edwards, Massachusetts, outside of Boston, which is one of those assignment that you sort of look back on and say, "How in the world could they do this?"  Our job--I was assigned to a headquarters battalion, commanded by a lieutenant colonel, and our job was to provide support for the post.  We did the cooking--by the way, all-black battalion.  We cleaned the post.  We did the driving, and as a platoon leader, as a lieutenant, I became the mess officer for providing food for all the other folks on the post.
Speaker 1: Now, this is a traditional role, this is the role that the U.S. Army has always tried to assign black soldiers, it's a quartermaster corp.
Speaker 2: That's what we were doing.  And the only way I was able to escape that, I went down to my branch assignment in Washington [District of Columbia] because I had been on competitive tour for regular [U.S.] Army appointment.  The determination had not been made yet.  But I went to see some people in infantry branch, and say, okay, if this is what you guys want me to do, I'm not for it.  So I got transferred.  I was sent to Indiantown Gap Military Reservation, outside of Harrisburg [Pennsylvania].  There they had the 5th Infantry Division, a training division.  We trained incoming recruits.  And in that period, I became--one, I got promoted to first lieutenant.  I later became a training company commander, and after being promoted to captain, I went, became an operations Officer in that period, completely integrated.  In 1953, I was sent off to Fort Benning, Georgia for the advanced course in training.
Speaker 1: Now, that's near Columbus, Georgia, right?  Yeah, so, okay.  So when, upon completion of this training, you would be then what?  I mean what would you--would you be promoted to?
Speaker 2: I was a captain.
Speaker 1: Captain, all right.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And I'll point out, I stayed a captain a very, very long time.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so were you--what were you specifically trained for at Fort Benning?  What did they--
Speaker 2: At Fort Benning?
Speaker 1: Yeah, was there an occupational training that you were--
Speaker 2: It was infantry.
Speaker 1: Infantry, okay.
Speaker 2: And it's an officer course of six months' training.  And we were basically taught from staff officer, unit commander, the kinds of things that infantry captains would be expected to do, once they get back into the units.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, this takes us to--now, okay--now, when did you go to Fort Leavenworth [Kansas]?  Is that--
Speaker 2: I went to Fort Leavenworth after--from this training at Fort Benning--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I then went overseas to Germany and spent three years in Germany in Mainz, Gonsenheim [USAG (United States Army Garrison) Wiesbaden Military Training Area, Mainz, Gonsenheim].
Story_ID: 34253
Speaker 1: I then came back to the [United] States [from three years of tour in Germany] to go to Prairie View [A&M University, Prairie View, Texas] as an assistant professor of military science in '57 [1957] and went to Leavenworth [Fort Leavenworth, Kansas] in 1960.
Speaker 2: Okay, Prairie View in 1957.  Then Leavenworth in 1960.
Speaker 1: And the reason I was sent to Prairie View was, as I've said earlier, I did not have a degree, and I had been integrated into the regular [U.S.] Army. And it was--appreciated the fact that I should have a degree, if you're gonna be regular Army officer.  I was sent to Prairie View to be on ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] duty and also have a chance to compete for my degree.

Speaker 1: Is there anything--let me go back to Germany for a second.  Now, you were--what are the things that you remember about your service in Germany [USAG (United States Army Garrison) Wiesbaden Military Training Area, Mainz, Gonsenheim]?  Any significant things there that you can tell us?
Speaker 2: Significant thing in Germany?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's--I know they had erected the Berlin Wall, and Berlin and--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, that would, but that--
Speaker 1: --the East and the West.  But--
Speaker 2: That was not, in my bailiwick, but that was later, too, by the way, the Berlin Wall.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But in three different jobs, I had opportunities to do things that you could only--if you had to write out what you wanna do, it could not have been better.  One year I spent being a communications officers because when I was at Indiantown Gap [Military Reservation, outside of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania], I had a chance to go to Benning [Fort Benning, Georgia] to learn how to be a communications officers.  I was able to do that in Germany. I was able to establish a MARS [Military Affiliate Radio System] site, that is, a Ham radio site for our regiment named CCB.  It's our call sign, and my regimental commander, or then combat commander thought that was neat.  And he said, "That's great."  And so I was able to please him and got this site going.  Our soldiers had a chance to talk to the, back to the [United] States.  That was a plus.  The next year, I spent as a company commander, armored infantry company.  And we did very well there.
Speaker 1: This is a tank unit?
Speaker 2: Say that again?
Speaker 1: It was a tank unit?
Speaker 2: Armored Infantry.
Speaker 1: Armored Infantry.
Speaker 2: Yeah, armored personal carriers--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --for the uninformed, you can't tell the difference except there's no gun on it, on APC [armored personnel carrier].
Story_ID: 34255
Speaker 1: I guess the best way to describe my success at that company [USAG (United States Army Garrison) Wiesbaden Military Training Area, Mainz, Gonsenheim], in those days, the [U.S.] Army had in-depth, inspector general visits to check out your readiness.  In Germany, we had another mission also to, in time of a war, each unit had a function--place to go.  Our place was to protect the bridges over the Rhine River.  They rotated the assignment for the bridge protection among the various units in our division.  It so happened that the time our IG [Inspector General] took place, which are unannounced, my company had the bridges, and I raised the question--we knew that we were gonna have a IG coming, and I asked the battalion commander, what happens after we've gotten our things laid out for the inspection, all the clothes and the equipment laid out in lines and our vehicles are polished and all ready for the inspection, my question to the colonel, "Sir, what happens if before the inspection starts, we get an alert to go to our wartime positions?"--which we knew happened every month?  The answer was, I got back, "Don't worry about it."  Yes, sir.  And so we laid our equipment the night before the inspection the next morning, and at 4:30, the alarm went off, alert.  Now, I got my company with all the equipment laid out on the beds, on the floors, our equipment on our trucks were put on the side, stacked up and ready for an inspection.  Colonel, what do I do?  He said, "We're going.  It's an alert."  Great.  We tore the stuff off the beds, put 'em in different bag, took the stuff off the line up on the side of the tracks and put 'em back in the trucks, and ready to go to war.  As we're going out the back gate of our concern, the major exec officer, he comes running down, "Stop.  Becton, you gotta stand the inspection."  Now, I got 186 people dressed to go to war, all the things that you can imagine.  And I said a few unkind words to the major, and he said, I understand.  You gotta stand the inspection.  Okay, I assembled all of my key, non-commissioned officers [NCOs] and officers together.  As the unit went back into the motor pool where our trucks went.  I said, okay, guys, you got one job.  I want you to go from room to room, and use this expression, "Okay, you think you're good; prove it."  And I'm happy to say that they were able to demonstrate that we could get it done.  It didn't have all the spit and polish because it had been roughed up, but it got back done together, and that demonstrated to the, my battalion commander that we could do it.  The other thing that I helped to sell my case, was we were pretty in physical training.  And we came out Number One in the Battalion Physical Training Company and in the area where there's an armored tanker unit there too.  The best tank company came over to check us out, and we went over to check them out in terms of inspection, checking.  And I told my troopers, anyone that has a higher score than I have will have the afternoon off, just in the morning.  And every exercise--we had five exercises to do, before I did every exercise, I had to the entire company around me, making sure I did it right.  And that afternoon, about three-fourths of my company were on pass.  This same major I mentioned, the operations officer came by.  Where are your people?  I told him this, and he started laughing at it.  And I knew exactly what I was doing.  I got them charged up, they had--we ended up with the best scores in the whole Mainz, Gonsenheim area.  And I was hurting because I (laughter), they made sure I did everything exactly right.  That and a few other things was able to convince the leadership that I should get an education and later go to Leavenworth [Fort Leavenworth, Kansas].
Speaker 2: Okay, we're gonna pause here.  Going to Leavenworth sounds scary for most people (laughter).  You're talking about Fort Leavenworth, not--
Speaker 1: Fort Leavenworth.  That's--have you been there?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No, I've never been to Leavenworth.
Speaker 1: Well, it's, the prison is not--it's on the post too.
Speaker 2: Is it?  Okay.
Speaker 1: Yep.  Yeah, I gotta be careful when I say going to Leavenworth to some civilians because--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they--
Speaker 1: --to the Command and General Staff College [CGSC].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 34256
Speaker 1: All right, Fort Leavenworth [Kansas], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in Prairie View [A&M University, Prairie View, Texas], I--
Speaker 1: This is 19--
Speaker 2: --spent three years there as professor of military science.  The last year, I was a full-time student.  The Army had a program called, excuse me, Final Semester Plan.  In your final semester, you go full time, and they'll pay the price.  And so I was able to get my degree at Prairie View.  My wife [Louise Thornton], who had already had a registered nurse status, was able to become a, get a Bachelor of Science [degree] in Nursing Education and for a six-month period was the acting dean of the College of Nursing Education.  You know, we were much older than the students and the dean had gone to get her doctorate, and so Louise became the acting dean.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: And then we went to Leavenworth.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're in your thirties by now, right, at Prairie View?
Speaker 2: (Unclear), I went to Leavenworth in 1960.  I was twenty-four [years old], not quite, twenty-six.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, you're in mid, yeah, late twenties.
Speaker 2: Twenty-(unclear) we're talking arithmetic twenty--from 1926, twenty-four.
Speaker 1: Okay, twenty-four, all right, you're still a young man.  So Prairie View, now, 1957 at Prairie View, now, this is your first time in a black college environment, right?
Speaker 2: First time in a black college environment, first time receiving, having a black instructor.  See, in all my schools in Lower Marion [elementary and high school], I never had a black instructor.  And the classes I had off, three hours there and six hours there, I never had a black instructor.  It wasn't until I got to Prairie View, I had a black instructor, not a black instructor, but all black instructors.
Speaker 1: The president was black, everybody, right?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay, who was president then?
Speaker 2: Dr. E. B. Evans, veterinarian.  He was the first president, and he had been there for twenty-odd years, but he was a principal before they changed the title to president.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so they called him the principal of Prairie View before--
Speaker 2: Well, when I got there, he was president then.  They made the change in, ah, late '40s [1940s] to president.
Speaker 1: Okay, Prairie View's in Texas, East Texas.
Story_ID: 34257
Speaker 1: So, in 1960, you go to Fort Leavenworth [Kansas], right--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --for officers'--
Speaker 2: Command General Staff College [CGSC] is the title of it.
Speaker 1: Command General Staff College, all right.  Okay, well, tell us about that?
Speaker 2: There were, ooh, I'm drawing a mental blank right now, but there were eight black students in my class.  And I knew one before I got there, one of my classmates by correspondence, personally, did not know any of them.  And we decided when we got there that, mind you, we were integrated throughout the community.  We decided that we're gonna work together to graduate.  And on any tough subject, we got together.  Preparation for the examination, we got together, all except one.  The senior officer, senior black officer--he was a lieutenant colonel, he felt that he was above that.  He didn't need this kind of help.  So seven of us would work very hard even at helping each other write papers.  All this is legal.  The eighth one did it on his own.  Fast forwarding twelve months, he flunked and we made it.  But it was a great experience, came out in the upper 10 percent of the class, was assigned from there to France.
Speaker 1: Now, this is something we ought to just chew on for a second, the idea that--'cause I've heard so many people say, especially in the scientists--the sciences, that you really do much better if you work with a group, a study group.
Speaker 2: There's no question about that.
Speaker 1: And there are, but there's an attitude by some individuals and, I've heard this about black individuals in school too, that they feel that they have to do it on their own as something to prove.  And they won't get involved in a study, any study group.  Then you have the other side of it where black students are isolated and not allowed to be in a study group.  So they have to do everything the hard way because they've never been allowed to be in one.
Speaker 2: And which is why in school, you don't have any first sergeant or battalion commander or any other, telling you, you can't do that.  You're on an honor system, and there's nothing dishonorable about studying together.  The other people do it.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And it worked.
Speaker 1: Okay, I just wanted to make that point before we moved on.  All right, now, so after graduation, you went on to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, let me mention one other thing about one of my--an aside.  At Leavenworth, I ran across a Captain Gus Dielens, D-I-E-L-E-N-S from Upper Darby, Pennsylvania.  He was a West Pointer, and in high school days, he was playing, he was the quarterback for Upper Darby High School.  And in the game that Lower Marion [High School] played Upper Darby, we beat them.  Gus was throwing as quarterback, and I was catching as a defending linebacker.  I think the records reflect I caught four of his passes.  And I had not seen him after that until we got to Leavenworth.  And we just talked about that, just one of those little, "Oh, by the way" things, fun things.
Story_ID: 34258
Speaker 1: Okay, after leaving [Fort] Leavenworth [Kansas] (laughter), we were assigned to--overseas.  I was assigned to France.  Now, I thought that I was in training to learn how to lead and--combat troops.  There are no combat troops in France.  We had low decisions (unclear).  I later found out that there were twelve of us in that class that were assigned, twelve combat arms officers, infantry, armor, artillery, assigned to France.  Why are these twelve combat arms officers assigned?  Because the commander of the communications zone in France complained to the Department of the Army, he's not getting his fair share of people.  So the powers to be picked out twelve of us.  And we were split up.  We had, and three of us went to the forward part of Germany--of France.  Three went to the base part of France, and six were in the headquarters in France, called Com-Z, Communications Zone.  The three of us that went to forward part included the one black who failed at Leavenworth, and another guy, an armor officer, a very good friend, and we ended up by being the forward zone of the [U.S.] Army in France.  It was, I learned more about logistics and support in that job as a Major than I ever could have learned by going to a combat unit.  As a matter of fact, the chief of staff of that command became my mentor, and he became my mentor because I developed another activity, officiating in basketball.  I got to be pretty good, and he had become my biggest critic on my officiating.  And we even traveled together.  I'm a major, he's a colonel.  We got to know each other quite well, and when I got promoted to a general officer, he was one of the first persons to contact me and grab me and everything else, a good mentor.  But, it was that, being able to do things like that, I started a "Dad's Club" in--which I started earlier in Germany, but we picked it up in France, a club to help male soldiers to understand what being a dad is all about.  And it had a church relation too.  My assignment in France took place when [President John F.] Kennedy was killed, which was an experience that--you don't wanna go through many of those.  The French broadcast stations played somber music during--from the time he was killed until his funeral.  I also picked up the responsibility for preparing plans for the non-evacuation-non-combat evacuation, that is, the family members in time of war, we've gotta get 'em out, the ones in Germany.  My command had the responsibility, when it came to the border, Franco-German border, to pick them up there and move them to a safe haven, which we couldn't say where safe-haven was, but it was Spain, across the entire width of Germany--of France, down into Spain.  I was one of the planners to make that happen, and we also were the ones to exercise--to run exercises to make sure it could be done.  So that way you got visibility among a lot of people by the senior officers, by your soldiers and there weren't that many black officers around.  It helped.
Story_ID: 34259
Speaker 1: Did you come back to the United States in '64 [1964] or did you--were you there in--
Speaker 2: Yes, came back to the Armed Forces Staff College--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in Norfolk, Virginia.  We left in sixty--December of '63 [1963], and the Armed Forces Staff College is a six-month course for those officers who had been successful and had done well.  And this is the first time we had classes with other than [U.S.] Army officers.  All services were there.  And the most memorable thing about that, several, one, the schools were just integrating, and our third child, our daughter, was going to school in fourth grade.  And while we lived on a post at Norfolk, the kids went to the same school, not to the black schools as they had done before.  The principal of the school that our daughter went to met the bus coming in to make sure this little black child--and she was the only one, got off the bus okay and got to her class.  And when school was over, he was there to make sure she got on the bus and nobody bothered her.  She developed (unclear), she's special, (laughter), that type of thing.  And she was a good student.  Interestingly enough, at the same time, because we got orders to go to Washington [District of Columbia], coming out of the Armed Forces Staff College, mind you now, this is in now, '64 [1964].  The "Brown" Act [Brown v. Board of Education, 1954] has been signed.  There's certain murmurs (unclear) about schools.  Virginia was going through a total opposition to integration.
Speaker 1: Right, they just had a Norfolk 17 and all that.
Speaker 2: All those.  I got orders to be assigned to Washington as did many of my classmates.  And on one particular weekend, we were given time to come up and make arrangements for housing.  And we had a, down there, a sheet of people who had advertised housing being available.  I, like everyone else, went through that list, three or four names, realtors came up, and every place we went to, we got turned down.  It became clear why we were turned down because the person said, down there, the houses available, three-bedroom, two baths, etc., etc., when we showed up, all of a sudden, the house was taken off the market; went back to Norfolk to Armed Forces Staff College, and I told the adjutant, the major what happened.  He told a commander, the brigadier general what happened.  The general didn't believe him.  So he called me up.  I was invited to his office and explained what I'd done.  He told me, bring me the list.  So I brought the list to him.  And he said, okay, I'm gonna call these people.  Give me the school, the names of the places you called.  I did.  He called everyone, and said, this is General so and so, Commander of Armed Forces Staff College.  I have a major coming into your area.  He's interested in housing, and this is the kind of house that he wants, three bedrooms, two baths, etc., etc.  Do you have a house?  Oh, by all means.  One other thing you should know about him, he's a black American.  All of a sudden, all of those houses disappeared.  Not one was available for him to say, Becton, go to it.  What he did tell me, major, you go up there in Washington and stay as long as you want till you find a place to live.  I'm still talking--this is 1964.  And we did, and we happened to find a place with the help of some friends, in Northern Virginia, I mean, excuse me, in Washington, one block North of Walter Reed [Hospital].  Are you familiar with Washington?
Speaker 1: Yes, right.
Speaker 2: Okay, this is on Floral Street, one block North of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The houses they showed us, that we went to first, in Alexandria, Arlington, Falls Church [Virginia], you wouldn't put your first enemy in those.  So we bought this house in Washington.  That's how we got a house because the commander recognized what the problem was.  And this was his first experience with that kind of a problem--with that type of problem.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you actually got a better house and--
Speaker 2: Got a better house, better place to live.  The schools were great.  The schools that our kids went to were, even though Washington had the problem with race, these were the better schools, Shepherd Junior High--I mean [Shepherd] Elementary School.  Drew Junior High [School], (laughter).  The oldest daughter went to, yeah, yeah, where did they go?  High school in Washington.  I should know that because I inherited all those schools later on.
Story_ID: 34260
Speaker 1: Okay, now, 1964 was also a time when the, well, just, I guess it was 1965 actually, the Vietnam War really became hot--
Speaker 2: That's when it really broke out.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But I had another experience in 1964, '65 [1965] which also helped my future.  Johnson [President Lyndon Johnson] became the president.  And that was in '64 [1964], '63 [1963], actually, but in '64 [1964], he wanted his military assistants, one to be a black American.  Each of the services had an officer assigned to the president's office.  And he wanted one of them to be a black American, and he wanted his Air Force pilot, Air Force II pilot to be the senior of the three.  I was selected by the [U.S.] Army to be the Army rep [representative].  I was a serving, then lieutenant colonel.  The officer that the president wanted to be his senior was a major selected to be promoted to lieutenant colonel, and therefore, I got shot down.  So what the Army did, since I couldn't get that, they asked me would I be interested in going to graduate school?  Sure.  And I was sent to a new graduate school that the Army, the military were training, training officers to compete with the McNamara Whiz Kids, [Robert] McNamara being the [U.S] Secretary of Defense who came up with these off-the-wall ideas.  And they wanted to have people on the ground who had been in combat to explain the facts of life.  I was one of those thirty to be selected.  I happened to have been the senior Army officer of the group.  Therefore, I was the Army rep in talking to the other people and representing the Army.  So, I went off to school, then as a lieutenant colonel, and as a full-time student.  The degree was granted by the University of Maryland, even though we had classes in Northern Virginia.  And this program rotated around from Maryland to Rensselaer [Polytechnic Institute, Troy, New York] and a few other schools, systems analysis.  My degree, Masters in Economics, guess what they're based on?  Mathematics.  I go back to my (laughter) experience in mathematics.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you got your master's degree in, well, it'd be in nineteen sixty--
Speaker 2: '66 [1966].
Speaker 1: '66 [1966], okay.  So this is, okay.
Speaker 2: And as an aside, one of our fellow residents here, well, one of my classmates in that master's program, and he's in bad shape right now.  And my boss, who let me--released me after I was assigned to the Office of Chief of Staff [of the U.S. Army], to go and to join a unit going to Vietnam, his widow is here.  I saw her just yesterday, as a matter of fact, so small community.
Story_ID: 34261
Speaker 1: Okay, so, in, okay, '66 [1966], now, did you--I know you went to Vietnam.  Did you go in '66 [1966] or--
Speaker 2: '67 [1967].
Speaker 1: '67 [1967], okay.
Speaker 2: I graduated from graduate school in '66 [1966].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Assigned to the Office of Chief of Staff [of the U.S. Army], which was unique in itself, and went off to this unit at Fort Campbell [Kentucky], getting ready to go to Vietnam.  I arrived there in September, and the only way I arrived--I got that job, again, the good Lord looking out for me, I guess, the first person they offered this job to, lieutenant colonel, was assigned to our operations in the Pentagon--[U.S.] Army.  He had been in that job for thirty-three months.  And the Army branch of armor called and asked if he could be released four months early because he needed to get a complete assignment, he thought, of thirty-six months.  His boss in operations said, no.  We need him for the whole thirty-six months.  I became the next person they asked.  Hey, can you get released?  Hope so.  So I went to see my boss, brigadier general, whose widow is here now and explained that this is a job that, a chance to command a unit.  And if I were to go as a replacement to Vietnam, I could not get a battalion because Westmoreland [General Westmoreland] had a policy, no one forty [years old] or older could get a command.  I was forty.  The general said, hell, yes.  If they give me a replacement, you can go.  The branch gave him a replacement.  I got a--went out to Fort Campbell in September of 1967.  We deployed to Vietnam in December.
Story_ID: 34262
Speaker 1: Now, the interesting part about all of that, this is an airborne unit.  And I had gone to airborne school in route from France to Norfolk [Virginia], became airborne qualified, five jumps.  When I joined the 101st Airborne Division, I had to have one more jump for pay purposes.  Okay, I made the jump.  I'm a new commander coming in to an airborne unit, never been in combat jumps, never had any combat experience--armor experience, except going to jump school.  This is a calvary unit, and never been assigned to a calvary unit up until this time.  But, hell, it's simple.  And so the guy who accepted me in that division had previously been a lieutenant colonel in the 9th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Division in Korea.  And he knew me.  He accepted me even though I was a new airborne trooper and never commanded calv--
Speaker 2: Let me ask you this.  I've often wondered about this.  What is the role of a--I think I sort of know, but what is the role of the calvary in modern warfare without horses?
Speaker 1: Name only.  We did the same thing.  We had equipment [clearing throat].  I had tanks, personnel carriers.  It so happened that the unit, this Second Squadron 17th Calv [Calvary] was the only calv unit that division had.  In theory, we were to provide the covering forces, out in front of the combat units.  We were to provide the sneak peep and be damn cautious, as we say, reconnaissance, but once we got in country, we were just like any other combat unit.  And it so happened, I was able to convince the division commander that all the other divisions, the other five divisions were using their calv squadron, put a troop with each of the divisions, each of the regiments, to do these reconnaissance, covering force, those kinds of things.  And the only time the squadron commander saw his people, when you delivered mail or something like that.  I was able to convince our division commander, you got a better unit than that.  Give me the same piece of real estate that you give to your infantry units, and we'll do a better job.  We've got more communications.  We've got transportation because they're airborne and walking, and we got jeeps, and we got the fire power.  As I said, I knew the guy.  He said, okay, we'll try it.  He let us do our thing.  We had an (unclear) operation just like everyone else, and we did a pretty good job.
Speaker 2: Okay, does the calvary use more helicopters than any--I mean, you said, it was just name only, but I seem to have some image of the Vietnam War with helicopter units used more in air Calvary situations.
Speaker 1: We used--helicopters are used for any kind of unit--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Straight infantry, airborne infantry, calv, but that was our modus operandi.  We used helicopters, and I had a helicopter troop, which I had to leave at Campbell [Fort Campbell] because they didn't have sufficient maintenance for helicopters in country, so we were told.  But when I arrived in country, with our unit, I always had helicopter support provided by other units who had helicopters.  And we made our business of being able to put any blocking force, particularly on places where, say a peninsula, move back up a couple miles or so with our ground forces, catch the enemy in between and push them against that blocking force, using our helicopters to leap frog, very effective, effective so much so that the deputy commander of Vietnam, Creighton Abrams, who I had known earlier, used to visit me in the field.  He would come out about once a week, sit on my jeep with me.  What are you doing now, Becton?  And I explained what we were doing.  And we got quite a relationship so much so that if I had a godfather, Abrams became that godfather.  And it was Abrams that got me my division when I came up to become a division commander, even though he had died.
Speaker 2: How did that happen?
Speaker 1: He selected me to be a Command Division (unclear) when a division became available. He then died, and his replacement came in.  I still had five months to go.  He, and the incoming guy said, if Abe said, "Becton gets it, Becton gets it."  It made a whole bunch of armor [branch] folks unhappy.
Story_ID: 34263
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're in Vietnam until 1969.  Now, what were the--
Speaker 2: I left in, I went December of '67 [1967], left in November of '68 [1968], '69, [1969], same difference.
Speaker 1: Okay, what are your reflections about Vietnam [War]?  I know the controversial war, and it was--
Speaker 2: People, particularly, the media said that the [U.S.] Army got beat, failed.  They used Tet [the Tet Offensive] of '68 [1968] as the example of the defeat.  Hell, we won Tet.  We kicked their butts.  And the unit, the area where I was located--I had said my unit had an area, was in a company Fukven (ph.), the county, we captured the incoming cadre from North Vietnam that were gonna set up the VC [Viet Cong] to become a Tet there to attack the American forces.  And so when Tet took place, there were no bad guys available.  We had cleaned them up.  We paid a price later because when, after they were withdrawing, those who came back through our county, they tried to do a job on us, but we took care of them too.
Speaker 1: Okay, so in terms of the protests about the war and the--
Speaker 2: We read about those over there.  What the hell are the protesting--look, we're winning.  When Martin Luther King [Jr.] was killed, I had a small assembly of our people for a small memorial service, led by a chaplain, did our thing, went back to war.  I did not have the enlisted, killing officers, (unclear) officers, I didn't have the drug culture because my unit was volunteers, not regular Army.  So these weren't the kids who got drafted to come in and smoke pot and everything else.  And we were very proud of what we were doing.  Of course, the interesting story, I just met with that unit a month ago.  We get together every so often.  And it's amazing how a little old story that started in '67 [1967], '68 [1968], how it's grown to a massive victory.  We did this, we did that.  We were pretty good, but we weren't as good as the rumor has us now.
Speaker 1: Okay,--
Speaker 2: War stories have a way of growing.
Speaker 1: And what about the people of Vietnam?  What are your feelings about the people?
Speaker 2: People in Vietnam?  I went back to Vietnam in 1999.  I started by going through North Vietnam first, which is the best way of doing it.  I really didn't wanna do this, but the guy who invited me said, you ought to go down there.  So we did.  They want money.  And Saigon has changed its name to Ho Chi Minh City, and it's a buzzing place, bicycles and motor scooters all over the place.  And what used to be anti-American or anti-South Vietnam are now very positive.
Speaker 1: Does it behoove a soldier to think about politics, I mean when they're in a situation like that?  I mean now the Vietnam War is over, and it seems like the Vietnamese are happily being Vietnamese.  I mean it wasn't the big terror that everybody thought was gonna happen if they, if the U.S. left.  Do you ever reflect on those days about, you know, was it worth all the bloodshed and--
Speaker 2: Nothing is worth the bloodshed, but yet the people of Vietnam welcomed us, they're friends, my barber, I've had him now for probably ten years, works at the PX, Vietnamese.  He's developed a Christianity, Christian religion.  He's now a preacher on the side, when he's not cutting hair.  He's typical of so many Vietnamese, others, doing things.  I would defy you to go anyplace in any major city, particularly, near the outskirts without seeing a Vietnamese church, a Vietnamese community or Vietnamese shop.  You're gonna find them.  They've got the funny-looking signs out front.  I think that we have, the Meli [Meli massacre, Vietnam] that occurred where we killed--not "we," but that character did--killed some people, that's behind us, in my view.
Speaker 1: Okay, it seems like it--
Speaker 2: And our soldiers should not be concerned about politics, by the way.
Story_ID: 34264
Speaker 1: In terms of the treatment of black soldiers in the [U.S. Army]--had it progressed any by the Vietnam War, in terms of how black soldiers were treated because there're a lot of--I know there's been books written about the experience of black soldiers in the war.  I think one is called "Bloods" and--
Speaker 2: I, my experience in Vietnam [coughing], excuse me, my most amusing racial experience was, I was halfway through my command, and a reporter from Chicago [Illinois]--I forget the name of the paper, had come into division headquarters and they heard about this black commander out in the field.  I was the only battalion commander, black.  And he wanted to see the unit.  So the public affairs person brought him down, turned him over to me.  I met him.  What do you wanna see?  I wanna talk to your soldiers.  Okay, go talk to 'em.  You gonna be with me?  "Hell, no, I got work to do."  Well, who's gonna be with me?  You wanna talk to soldiers, didn't you?  There they are.  The other soldiers are out in the field.  Go talk to them.  We'll provide you transportation.  He was expecting to find some rumors that black commanders could not command white soldiers.  And a black commander could not do this, could not do that.  And that did not happen in the 2nd Squad and 17th (unclear).  He spent one afternoon, part of a night, didn't wanna stay out there a full night with us because bad guys are out there, got in his chopper and went back.  That was 1968.  I've yet to see that report--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because he couldn't find what were his preconceived ideas.  Those are the kind of racial things that I saw.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so in terms of the general treatment of black soldiers over there, do you think it was better than it had been in Korea?
Speaker 2: Oh, in my view, where you had problems, those problems were self generated or had individual commanders who had their own bias.  And 19--by Vietnam, we were able to deal with those kinds of commanders.
Speaker 1: Now, I know it's said, years ago, I think when Martin Delaney took command in the Civil War as the highest-ranking black officer, he was in a conversation with Lincoln [President Abraham Lincoln], he said, Delaney says, I've never commanded men in the field.  And Lincoln basically said, it's just management, you know, it's basically management, is what it is, if you're a smart--
Speaker 2: You're fading down now, and I--
Speaker 1: No, Lincoln told Delaney back in 1865 when he was appointed a major in the Civil War, the highest-ranking black officer, Delaney said, "I've never commanded troops before and he said, "Well, it's management."  That's what it is.
Story_ID: 34265
Speaker 1: Now, what is your management philosophy in terms of commanding troops?
Speaker 2: I have a philosophy, as a matter of fact, thirteen points.  The first one, be professional.  Second, integrity is non-negotiable.  Three, loyalty is a two-way street, loyalty.  Four, chain of command, yeah, chain of command works, if you use it.  Five, admit mistakes.  Six, disagreement is not disrespect.  I can look in that book for the other three, but they--maintain your sense of humor.  Communications, safety, security and one other, is essential.  And the last one, keep things in perspective.  Now, I may have missed--I did miss one.  But I haven't used that for quite some time now.
Speaker 1: That's pretty good--
Speaker 2: And by the way, that same philosophy I used--I just changed the title and used it every place I've been.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think when you were superintendent of schools, you put "Children are Number One" at the top.
Speaker 2: Children first, Number One.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the rest of the things still work.
Speaker 1: Well, so you're saying pretty much, everything kind of--those are the principles by which you manage most things.
Speaker 2: Leadership, management--the only major difference between command and management is how--who were you, who sang it, and how you go about it.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay--
Speaker 2: And I'm happy to say that you can probably find a few soldiers around who still remember that, who I worked with.  These are now senior commanders.
Story_ID: 34266
Speaker 1: So at, when you were in Vietnam [during the Vietnam War], what rank were you at that point?
Speaker 2: Lieutenant colonel.
Speaker 1: Lieutenant colonel, okay.  And what was your, I guess, biggest challenge?  Now, this was actually combat, so the stakes are very high.  So what was your biggest challenge and what was your biggest accomplishment, would you say?
Speaker 2: Biggest challenge.  Avoid getting people killed.  And you do that by being very, very thorough in your planning and in using your staff work to help you understand what we're capable of doing.  I also have an open-door policy.  Any soldier can come to see me; same thing was true when I was school superintendent, when I was director of FEMA [Federal Emergency Management Agency].  Anyone could come in my front door--
Speaker 1: Now, this is regardless of rank or--
Speaker 2: Regardless of rank.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It used to drive a few people up the wall, but what I was trying to do was develop a rapport with the men and women I had working for me.  The answer is, when I responded to a complaint, that went through the chain of command so that the person's individual bosses give him the results, not coming from me, so that guy can say, "I bypass you."  That's critically important so you maintain that relationship.  So, not getting people killed or hurt to me was the most important thing.  By the way, "accomplishing our mission," that came first.  The biggest success, we were a successful unit in combat.  We received presidential citation from the U.S. government, a presidential citation from the Vietnamese government.  I had one Medal of Honor winner.  I had one Distinguished Service Cross--that's the second highest, recipient award--recipient.  And the fact that we still get together every two years, I think sort of speak to what kind of unit we had.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is your command staff that gets together every--
Speaker 2: Even though that unit had many commanders since then, but when the division has, that's back here now, have a ceremony like they do, they're heading back to Afghanistan for a fifth or sixth time, we get invited.  I think that speaks to what kind of a unit we had.
Story_ID: 34267
Speaker 1: So you came back [from the Vietnam War] in 1969, and well, what did you do when you came back?
Speaker 2: Went to a National War College.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's the school here at Fort McNair, Washington [District of Columbia].  As far as I'm concerned, it's the top school.  There are other people who will tell you different, but we've turned out more admirals and generals than any other school and ambassadors.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: Matter of fact, if you looked in Colin Powell's [General Colin Powell; former Secretary of State] book or my book, I was able to get Colin Powell into the National War College, and that sort of helped him too.
Speaker 1: Now, how did you meet Colin--well, I know how--well, describe how you met, when you first met Colin Powell?
Speaker 2: I was sitting on a board, looking at records for people to go to the senior service colleges, Army War College, National War College, Air, Navy.  I'd never met the guy before.  I happened to have been the president of the board.  And there were three-I was a major general, and there were three, three brigadier generals sitting on the board.  And our modus operandi, we'd take a look at the records of the officers who were eligible.  And they would put them in order of merit, based on what we thought individually.  On my piece of paper, a fellow named Powell [Colin Powell] came out Number One.  I never met him before, never heard of him before as a matter of fact.  And interestingly enough, he came out Number One on everyone else's piece of paper too.  And once we've done that, now, we had to select a school to go to.  I am a graduate of National War College.  Two of the three were graduates of Army War College, and the fourth person was the Chief of WAC, Women Army Corp., no war college.  But she had a vote.  And I said, okay, Powell goes to National War College.  And my three brigadier generals said, un-un, Becton, he's Number One, Army officer.  He's gotta go to Army War College.  Now, they're graduates of Army War College.  I said, guys, he's gonna go to the National War College.  Becton, you got one vote.  That's right.  I got one vote.  And there're three of you.  You've got three votes, one of each, but let me tell you something.  If he does not go to the National War College, every guy I think you want to see be selected won't make it.  If there were any one person, could shoot down a person. You wouldn't do that.  Try me.  He went to National War College.  And my book and his book said the same thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the three, two of the Army--well, three Army brigadiers, the WAC has retired long since, the two others, they both ended up by being senior to me.  They both ended up at four stars.  But at that time, Colin [Powell] was gonna go to National War College.  And it wasn't until after that happened that I met the guy.
Speaker 1: So this was, he went--you went in '69 [1969] and came out in 1970, and when did he go, would you say?
Speaker 2: When did I what?
Speaker 1: No, I--you came out in 1970.  When did Colin Powell go to National War College?
Speaker 2: He went in 19--this was '74 [1974].  I'm sitting on a board.  He went in '75 [1975].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  I just wanted to make sure we--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he went in '75 [1975].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  We're talking about the same period of time, pretty much.
Story_ID: 34268
Speaker 1: Now, so you, well, was National War College [Fort McNair, Washington, District of Columbia] difficult?
Speaker 2: Not really because it's not--it's a thought place, a thinking place, a place--you're not gonna go out there and challenge or walk over a hill or teach bayonet training or that.  It is a school that deals with all the capacities of the United States government, the civilian, the military, the national security aspects, the intelligence aspects.  Every day you have a speaker.  And then on that subject, you discuss after he leaves--intellectual place.  It was a challenging place from a standpoint, if you thought you were gonna sit there and don't think about something.  It forces you to give some thought, to be--get involved.  As a matter of fact, last year I received, I was selected for the National Defense Hall of Fame.  The National Defense is now the higher headquarters of National War College.  I was this year's selectee.  By the way, Colin [Powell; former Secretary of State] got selected to that place, oh, five, six years earlier.  And there's a picture of that, by the way, in that stack of pictures I gave you.
Speaker 1: So National War College, basically, coordinates in the mind of--I mean how the government is supposed to work and how the military fits into the--
Speaker 2: It's not so much coordinated.  It's solving problems that they're faced with.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We had many challenges of, from a national security standpoint.  Speakers come in and talk to us about national security.  And we, therefore, deal--what should our government be doing in these kinds of things.  When I was the director of FEMA [Federal Emergency Management Agency], I came over and was one of the speakers at the Industrial College of the Armed Forces [ICAF; Fort McNair], which is the equivalent of the National War College.
Story_ID: 34269
Speaker 1: So what did you do immediately after National War College [Fort McNair, Washington, District of Columbia]?  Now, you, were you--
Speaker 2: I had a chance, as I started to stay, to become a pilot because the [U.S.] Army needed experienced combat, senior officers to learn how to fly.  Or I had a chance to go command a brigade.  And when you talk to a soldier, that's no choice.  I was raised, trained to command units.  Now, I could fly some other time.  And so I went to Fort Hood [Texas] as a brigade commander.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, oh, by the way, I did learn how to fly a helicopter while I was in Vietnam.  Why?  In a scout helicopter, an observer helicopter, LOH, Light Observer Helicopter, you got two people, pilot, observer.  And that's what I used to fly around.  And I and my pilot agreed, if something were to happen to him, like he gets shot, heart attack or whatever, we gotta get that plane back on the ground.  And so I learned how to land a helicopter.  So I got my choice.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you got a chance to--
Speaker 2: But I went to command a brigade at Fort Hood, 2nd Brigade, Second Armor Division.
Speaker 1: Okay, and then your rank at this time is still--
Speaker 2: Colonel.
Speaker 1: Colonel, right, it's colonel.  And, now, so what did you--what were they actually doing at Fort Hood?  I mean what were they--
Speaker 2: What were they doing?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Training.
Speaker 1: Just training.
Speaker 2: Matter of fact--this was in '71 [1971].  The Cold War was taking place in Europe.  We had major racial problems in the Army, in the military in '70 [1970] and '71 [1971].  I was the only brigade commander at Fort Hood.  There were two divisions there, and there were 5, 10, 11, 12 brigade-sized units at Hood [Fort Hood].  I was the only black American in command at that time.  I was able to maintain law and order in my brigade when other units were having problems, particularly racial problems.  I required my battalion commanders to get involved with what's going on in their units during off-duty hours.  The Army is also going through women coming into the military.  In my unit, we had women who were in--worked in a unit as clerks and intelligence and all those things.  But they lived in a, one barracks, all women in the post lived in one barracks or a number of barracks together.  And that place became a--you would drive by that place at night, and you'd see women leaning out the windows and all manner of undress, and a bunch idiots are on the ground, males, screaming up at the women, women screaming back at the men.  And when my sergeant major showed me that, I said, that's not gonna make it.  The very next day, I told my battalion commander, I want all the women in your unit living in your barracks, not back in that place.  But, sir!  But, sir, hell.  They're your women.  Treat 'em as members of your unit.  They did.  And we had, you would think that--the guy who beat up on our women, they became protectors.  She works in my unit, like my sister or whatever.  And they'd provide that kind of relationship.  And by the way, that started something that I later developed a little bit of expertise in, women in the military.  And that was the first start, time we did it.  And we are very proud of it.  The rest of the division did not do that.  The division commander didn't say anything about it, and I have an idea that it's easier to get forgiveness than ask permission.  But that's the way I operate.
Story_ID: 34270
Speaker 1: Now, give us some idea of like, what was say the percentage of women in the military then [1970s], as opposed to now?
Speaker 2: What was the what?
Speaker 1: Percentage, I guess--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: --of women then as opposed to--
Speaker 2: I had about--
Speaker 1: --in the early '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: I had about 10, 15 percent in that category, not armed, not rifle or tankers, but you got so many--you got Quartermaster [Corps], Transportation Corps, chemical, all of those things women can do.
Speaker 1: And today, for instance, would that be a low number today or was that--what do you think (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It would be a relatively low number, and I say that because if I were to fast forward, I just finished being the vice chairman of a commission that the [U.S.] Congress set up for diversity, military leadership, diversity commission in which women in the military are one of the issues that we looked at.
Speaker 1: So, nowadays, what percentage would women be of the military?  What would you say?
Speaker 2: It's close to 20 percent.
Speaker 1: Okay, it's nearly double what it was then.
Speaker 2: Almost, in some cases, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, again, it's more assignment than it is total numbers.  We have women now who fly helicopters as gunships.  That was unheard of back when I was a young colonel.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, okay, so, is there any particular strategy you see as key to, you know, utilizing women better in the military?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the key starts at the top.  If the commander says it's gonna happen, that takes care of it.  In our position, on that commission I sat on, the Secretary of Defense had to make it clear what he expects of the military services.  And then it'll happen.  But if it doesn't happen at the top, diversity will be just a, it will only be a fond memory in anyone's mind.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: And by the way, industry takes the same approach.  I'm a former board member of General Dynamics.  The chairman of the board at General Dynamics now is a woman.  That would have been unheard of, unthinkable a couple of years ago.
Story_ID: 34271
Speaker 1: Now, let's see, now, you were at Fort Hood [Texas]--oh, well, in 1972, you're promoted as the sixth African American to obtain the rank of brigadier general in the United States Army.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In 1972, that took place in June, by the way.  But I came back to Washington [District of Columbia] after finishing my brigade to become the Branch Chief of Armor.  I took over that job in February of 1972.  Why did I get that job?  Because the guy who had been my predecessor got fired.  And the branch chief should be an experienced Armor office, tanker, somebody probably who should have fought in a tank, got all kinds of credentials, being a calv [calvary] trooper, tanker.  Well, Julius Becton never fought in a tank.  I've never even driven a tank down range.  I've never fired a tank gun.  But I was in the right place at the right time when they needed a colonel, a successful colonel in command.  And I happened to be that guy.  And we had a whole bunch of Armor [branch] guys go berserk.  You can't put Becton in there.  Well, talk to the boss.  Don't talk to me.  I became the branch chief.  Then I got promoted.  I'd been branch chief for seven months, get promoted; two months later, I'm out of there.  But during that period as branch chief, I was able to have some influence over the Armor branch because you're responsible for the assignments of all Armor officers from second lieutenant to colonel.  You're responsible for their education, where they--who goes to school, who gets assignments, who gets the plush jobs, who gets the other kind of jobs.  And I'm happy to say that one of my branch officers, that is, one of the majors working for me, and I had subordinate officers, became Chief of Staff of the Army at the top grade.  And we're friends to this day.
Speaker 1: Who was that?
Speaker 2: Gordon Sullivan.  A matter of fact, we talked just three days ago.  I've been fortunate in my command to have over the years, to have at least 10, 12 four-star generals eventually and more than twenty general officers came out of command at one--that were other than general before they got there.  So something works.  But I left branch chief in August of '72 [1972], got promoted to brigadier general and went to Fort Dix [New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Okay, now, Fort Dix is in New Jersey, right, I believe?
Speaker 2: New Jersey, yes, as deputy commander, responsible for basic training, advanced training.
Story_ID: 34272
Speaker 1: So, okay, so we had you at Fort Dix, New Jersey now.
Speaker 2: Deputy commander.
Speaker 1: Deputy Commander of Training, right, of new soldiers?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I ran the training center.  The commander ran all the other things at the post.
Speaker 1: Okay, any memorable stories from your assignment at Fort Dix?
Speaker 2: Yes, there's one interesting thing because I recorded this in a book.  The first commander I had, my boss, two-star, and I was one star, super, super guy to start working as a brand new brigadier.  The guy who replaced him and I had been colonels together, and selected to brigadier on the same list.  Then he got promoted the very next time to two stars, and I did not get promoted to two stars until the following list.  He came in as the commander, and he wanted to see his deputy be there to do some things, to his way of doing it and wanted to have some time (unclear) moving.  But I'm there, and they have not reassigned me.  And I couldn't understand why, nor could he.  I later found out what the problem was.  I mentioned General [Creighton] Abrams had said that I'm gonna command the Second--the First Calvary Division.  Then he died.  Now, the First Calvary Division was not due to change command until the end of the year or the first part of the following year, which meant that I've got two stars sitting at a place where one star should be, working for a two star who resented my being there because I'd been there longer than he, and when, anytime people would show up with a problem, they'd come see me because they've heard about me before.  And that irritated him too.  And it was nothing I could do about it.  When it came time to write my efficiency report, evaluation report, he wrote down ten points of, for evaluation, nine of which superlative, outstanding.  The 10th one, training management, I failed, according to him.  Now, keep in mind, I had now been selected to go command a division.  He had wanted a division in the worst way.  But this was his division.  He's had a command as a two star.  You only get one.  And now I got a command, going to a command that's something he would have loved to have done.  So he wrote it up that way.  The new Chief of Staff who said, "If Ab says Becton gets the division, Becton gets the division," by the time my report card gets to the Chief of Staff, I'm gone.  I'm heading to Fort Hood [Texas].  And he reads this thing, "What in the hell happened?"  We just put a man in a division and--by the way, my mission was then to convert it from a triple capability division to an Armor Division, full-fledged Armor Division.  And now I'm being told that his training management is from (unclear). The chief came down to Fort Hood just as soon as he got that report to take a look at what was going on.  I assume he was down there just to, you know, typical visit.  My boss, the corps commander, said, he was here to check you out.  Okay, what'd he find?  When he left (laughter), he didn't tell me anything.  And so that was one of the unhappiness that clearly, the guy who wrote my report, was not very objective.  So, I had a chance to do other things at Fort Dix too.  We set up a Men's Day program.  I mentioned that before.  We set up a family program.  We worked with getting women more involved in the activities.  And we turned out some pretty good trainees.  But that lasted from '72 [1972], September of '72 [1972] until December of '74 [1974].  And I then went to Fort Hood as a division commander.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 34273
Speaker 1: All right, now, Fort Hood [Texas] is--where is Fort Hood?
Speaker 2: Texas.
Speaker 1: That's in Texas.  That's the one near Austin, right, in Austin?
Speaker 2: That's the one that's north of Austin, and that's the one I'd been to previously.  And the largest post for units when there's no war.  There's a corps headquarters which is a sizable group in charge of two divisions.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what was your assignment--now, you're the commander of the division at Fort Hood, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: There are two divisions there.  I was commander of one of the divisions.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, all right, now, Fort Hood is where you had the horse incident.  You wanna talk about that now or--
Speaker 2: Fort Hood is where I, we had a calvary platoon in that division, strictly ceremonial.  And for most ceremonies we have, somebody's riding.  And it just so happened that when I had my little quote "horse incident", I was riding and also the commander of the troops, the guy who's in charge of the formation, reporting to me.  And you wanna know what happened?
Speaker 1: Yes, what happened, what happened?
Speaker 2: I am not a horseman.  I grew up (unclear) Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  They may have had horses there, but I never saw one.  By the time I got to Fort Hood, where they had a horse platoon, the outgoing commander's wife, is a true horse woman.  And she would make a point to training all incoming commanders who wanted to be trained on horses.  And I had to be trained.  So she taught me how to ride, how to sit straight in the saddle, how to handle the horse, and all the things you need to know, except one.  What happens when the horse bucks?  It so happened on this particular day, we had a ceremony, the entire division on parade.  Because we had a fuel crunch, we weren't using our tanks, just dismounted, and me and my commander of troops, the guy in charge of the troops, were on horses; had about 12,000, 13,000 soldiers on a field, another 3,000 spectators.  The horse I'm riding, I'd been on before.  I used to practice on him, and when they brought the horse up to me, for me to mount and go inspect the troops, about that time something unexpected happened.  And I hate surprises.  My intelligence officer had talked with the [U.S.] Air Force to get them to take a picture of this formation from the air because it doesn't happen that often.  And at the time, I gave my right leg over Ole Bill--the horse's name was Ole Bill, the other thing that I didn't mention.  We had a pair of matched mules pulling a wagon carrying two former retirees to--right behind me in the inspection.  This RF-4 jet came in on the deck, taking a picture.  That jet spooked the mules, who in turn, spooked my horse, and the picture that's in my book and plastered all over America, got the horse on his hind legs rearing up.  And I'm sitting tall in the saddle because my instructor said, you gotta sit tall in the saddle.  And if you look at the picture real hard, you'll see that I am pulling the horse's head off to the right because that's--as we were going up, he was leaning that way, and if I had been told what to do, it wouldn't have happened.  When a horse bucks like that, drop the reins.  So you're not pulling him either way.  He's gonna settle back down.  I didn't know that.  The next picture in that book, we're on the ground, my right leg under him, my Stetson still on my head, my reins in my hand, and I'm in the saddle.  So anyone who says that horse threw Becton, I showed them that picture.  And by the way, I've told this story quite a few times.  Anyhow, that's for the horse story, and the third picture in the book, have the people inspecting the horse.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you're standing.
Speaker 2: I'm standing.  They don't worry about me.  They're inspecting the horse.
Speaker 1: Hat on, everything, you know--
Story_ID: 34274
Speaker 1: And they--the horse is okay, they told me that.  I had a choice, I could walk the formation.  My leg hurt too much to do that.  I could ride the mule-pulled wagon.  I had too much pride to do that.  The only way around that battlefield was to ride the horse.  I got on the back of the horse.  I got applause all over the place, and we took off.  My mother-in-law who was there watching for the first time, she'd never been to a formation before, she said, he's gonna get back on that crazy horse again?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, and as I think I mentioned, my boss, my--Bob Schumaker, whose wife is my instructor, he's sitting in the front row, and his head is down like this, and you almost see the words, "My God, they gotta train another division commander."  It turned out pretty good.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Yeah, well--
Speaker 1: And that's the horse story.
Speaker 2: The photos are really dramatic in your book, you know, and the photographer got every stage of the incident.
Speaker 1: Yep, and for those who may be hearing this, but not reading it, page 126 and--125 and 126.
Speaker 2: All right, okay.  So, that's 1975, we're talking about, 1975.
Speaker 1: That was, that took place in 1976, I think--
Speaker 2: '76 [1976], okay.
Speaker 1: October.
Speaker 2: Yeah, all right, at Fort Hood, all right.
Speaker 1: Fort Hood.
Speaker 2: Okay, so well, what were some of the--now, was your--was your tenure at Fort Hood [Texas; as division commander] eventful otherwise?
Speaker 1: What were some of the things that we did?  Women in the military, we were head and shoulders above most other divisions.  Matter of fact, one of my contemporaries, Deputy Commander, 82nd Airborne Division, Roscoe Robinson, "No, women in my division.  We will not have any women here."  By the way, his widow lives here too.  I see her every so often.  And Roscoe and I had been together for a long time.  And I kept telling him, Roscoe, hey, you'd better get with it.  You are gonna have them.  And the last week that he was in command, they brought women into his division.  And he had his changing.  But we're proud of what we did for our, with our women.  We were converting the division from a triple capability.  By that, in Vietnam, they had been helicopter lifted, ground fought and they had jeeps and personnel carriers, triple capability.  We were changing into a pure Armor division, and that was my job.  And some people say, hey, Becton, you don't have any experience riding tanks.  You don't have any experience with the Armor division.  That's right.  But a job is a job.  You got good people, and be smart about it.  Well, we did the job.  Of course, it helped to have a, some good soldiers working for you, with you.  I had a superb commander who understood what we were faced with.  Plus, he had been the division commander before me.  So it was his division before I took over.  And he's the kind of a soldier, he let me command the division.  He didn't come down and, why aren't you doing this?  Why aren't you doing that?  He said, it's your division, do it.
Story_ID: 34275
Speaker 1: So when you look back on this period of time, do you think you had like good mentors along the way, I mean people giving you good advice and--
Speaker 2: You said, did I have mentors or did I--
Speaker 1: Yeah, good mentors, yeah, to advise you about how to--
Speaker 2: Oh, I had mentors, and we--by the way, that is one of the major things that the [U.S.] Army's working with now, mentoring.  It's critically important to get, help youngsters to come along, not counseling, but mentoring in the truest sense of teaching them, sit down, this is good; that's bad.  Think about that.  I had people to help me--and I'll be the first to admit, Creighton Abrams, while he never sat down and said, Becton, I want you to do this, this, this, I got that division because of his support.  At division, we used every device possible, people to people, organizational reflectiveness is now, back in those days, pretty essential, key, and I used that every chance I had.  We worked with the community.  They supported us and we supported them in more ways than one.  And race relations were something which were critically important to me.  Therefore, important to every man in that division--every man and woman in that division.  And it worked.
Speaker 1: Okay, you said, it starts at the top, starts at the top.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it starts at the top.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 34276
Speaker 1: And that job [division commander at Fort Hood, Texas] was followed by another job which shocked me, but I became the commander of the Operational Test and Evaluation Unit--Agency, OTEA.
Speaker 2: Now, what year is this?
Speaker 1: That's '46 [1946]--excuse me, '76 [1976], '78 [1978].
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you were commander of OTEA?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: O-T-I-A.
Speaker 1: O-T-E-A.
Speaker 2: "E", Okay, and what does that stand for?
Speaker 1: Operational Test and Evaluation Agency.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that unit's mission is very simple.  Perform operational tests on things, equipment, organizations.  What do I mean?  If the [U.S.] Army's gonna adopt a new tank, we know what the engineers have said that tank could do.  We know what the people who developed that tank, who designed it, built it, we know what they said it could do.  But until a soldier puts his hands on it and do the things that soldiers do to equipment, we're not gonna accept that piece of equipment.  And soldiers can do some interesting things to equipment.  And our job was to test the equipment.  I worked directly for the vice chief of staff in the Army, and Number Two person in the Army.  Early on, I had the opportunity to go to Fort Benning [Georgia] to see an operational test for a personnel carrier.  And we, they were doing such a poor job, the equipment was doing such a poor job holding up, I stopped the test while at Benning [Fort Benning].  I called back to my boss and told the general, sir, I'm down here at Fort Benning checking out an operational test of a mechanized Infantry vehicle.  It's failing, and I stopped the test.  So why are you calling me?  Sir, you're my boss, and I'm just the--"You're the evaluator, aren't you, Becton?"  "Yes, sir."  You stopped the test, didn't you?  Yes, sir.  What else you wanna hear?  That took care of that.  But what does that do?  That word went throughout the Army, the development community, engineers around the world, now, you've got a commander who went down and stopped the test because they were not--the equipment was not doing what it should be doing.  When I got that job, I said, why, why--I'm a division commander.  Why am I going down to something like this?  Becton, we sent you to school to become an operational, OR, operational research.  Your job was to learn how to test things, evaluate things.  Now, you've got one.  Do it.  So, we did it.  Well, among the tests we had for tank, the M--this tank that we have today, the "Abrams" is a tank that we tested, and it passed.  The replacement for this fight and funny (unclear) vehicle, called the "Bradley," been tested, passed.  We tested helicopters during my tenure.  We tested mortars.  We tested GPS [Global Positioning System], that thing you got in your car.  We did the operational tests on it.  They had a test called Max WAC, Maximum Effectiveness of Women.  That was done, one of the tests that we did.  It's the same thing, interesting enough, something I've been doing all along.  Now, I got a chance to be in a position to say, that works, let's do it.  So I had that job for, from October of '76 [1976] to October of '78 [1978], and then I got promoted to three stars.
Speaker 2: Okay, so this is 1978?
Speaker 1: '78 [1978].
Story_ID: 34277
Speaker 1: Now, all--beginning with your promotion in '72 [1972], did the black press cover it, like 'Jet Magazine' and that sort of thing?  Did they put, did they start talking about you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I became one of the 100 Best Black Known in the Country, whatever they call that title [100 Most Influential Blacks] that 'Jet' calls.
Speaker 1: I think '100 Most Influential Blacks'--
Speaker 2: That's it.
Speaker 1: That's in 'Ebony' [Ebony Magazine], yeah.
Speaker 2: I was one of those for three years in 'Jet', I mean in 'Ebony'.  When I, near the end of my tour as a two star, I was the senior black in the [U.S] Army.  And when I got to three stars, there were only, eventually three of us.
Story_ID: 34278
Speaker 1: So what happened after '78 [1978]?  Now, where did you go in '78 [1978]?
Speaker 2: Went to Germany--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and became the commander of VII Corps, the largest combat corps in the [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, of course, this is during the Cold War, and we were at our sector in the European Theater, and we obviously won that war.  The Soviet Union backed down.  The Berlin Wall later came down, not during my tenure, but we trained very hard, spent a lot of time in the field, did well with the community relations, with the local community.  I had a major command-wide conference of women in the military so much so that it was represented eventually throughout the Army.  We had--and just a wonderfully supportive, efficient command.  Our women got involved, our wives got involved.  When I'm asked as to what do I consider my favorite assignment, that was one of them, because of the familiness (ph.).  And I had truly good people.  The--I mentioned Gordon Sullivan earlier.  When he finished command of a battalion, he came up on the colonel's list and looking for a job.  And I heard about that.  I came back, had lunch with him.  I wanted him to become my Operations Officer in the corps.  Now, the Operations Officer should be a colonel, and in the past, a colonel who has had experience as a--in colonel assignments.  Gordon Sullivan had just finished his command as lieutenant colonel, had not pinned on the Eagles yet.  So I got him to become my Operations Officer, over the objections of several of my people, all my other colonels and a couple of brigadiers.  And I finally reminded, okay, guys, I got it.  Remember one thing.  I'm wearing the green tabs--we wear green tabs to represent the commander.  I didn't say I got three stars, but I got the green tabs.  Sullivan is gonna be my, become my G-3.  Boom, Gordon comes in, takes over the operations.  And within a month, every character who came up and said, who was opposed to it, "What a great idea we had."  Gordon's doing the job.  I'm happy to say that he went on to become Chief of Staff of the [U.S.] Army, and as Gordon will tell people when he has, when he's asked.  He said, the five most important people in his life, military life, his wife, his father, Julius Becton, Carl Vuono [retired United States Army General who served as the Chief of Staff of the United States Army from 1987 to 1991].  So, because I gave him a chance that very few junior colonels get.  I knew what kind of job--I knew what kind of job he could do.  And he did.
Speaker 1: Okay, it was success there, yeah.
Speaker 2: And I had that job--one last story, had that job two months short of three years.  And I tried to convince the Chief of Staff of the Army--his name was [Edward Charles] "Shy" Meyer--let me have it for two more years, two more months.  Then I'll become, I can become the longest serving.  "Becton, pack your bags and come home."  We're still friends to this day, but--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So, okay, so you come back to the United States.  This in 1981.
Speaker 2: 1981.
Story_ID: 34279
Speaker 1: '81 [1981], okay.  Now, so what did you do when you came back [from Germany in 1981, after serving as the commander of the U.S. VII Corps stationed in Cold War Europe]?
Speaker 2: I became the deputy commander of the Training and Doctrine Command, TRADOC.  And at that time, the Chief of Staff [of the U.S. Army] wanted to try something new.  He wanted me also to be the Army Inspector of Training.  They had not had one since [Friedrich Wilhelm August Heinrich Ferdinand]von Steuben, Revolutionary War.  And so I wore two hats, Deputy Commander of Training for Training and Doctrine Command, the Army Inspector Training.  In theory, I was inspecting my own facility, my own activity as well as other people.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, so you were there for two years, I guess?
Speaker 2: I came back in June of '81 [1981], and I retired in August of '83 [1983].
Speaker 1: Right, right, okay.
Story_ID: 34280
Speaker 1: When you retired in '83 [1983], let's see, what was going on in the country?  The president was Ronald Reagan.  We were--what were we doing as a country in '83 [1983]?
Speaker 2: I, after looking for a job from August until January, I ended up working for the administration as Director of the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance [in the United States Agency for International Development (U.S. AID)].  And I took that job for one reason because that job--there was no pay.  I was under dual compensation, and if you're not familiar with dual compensation, you cannot draw retired pay and pay from your job at the same time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I was not working for anything, for money.  But I took that job as my book points out and I've said before, while I was looking for a job, being interviewed, and in many cases, I'm told, you have more experience than the CEO [Chief Executive Officer].  Or you've got more responsibility than most of the people here.  I don't want their job.  I just wanna do my job.  My wife [Louise Thornton] went to work for Hospice of Northern Virginia and became a supervisor.  And while she was gone, I decided that I gotta do something around the house.  So I reorganized her kitchen.  In the cabinets, I took all the cans, same size, label facing out, all the bottles, boxes, condiments, and I, I was so proud of what I did.  She came home from work and took one look and I knew then, you gotta get your butt out of this house and go to work doing something.  So I took that job with [U.S.] AID.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: And my message when I tell this story, when I tell people about to retire, "Guys, unless you work in a kitchen, stay out of your wife's kitchen."  I got that message loud and clear.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, so you over-organized her kitchen, I guess.
Speaker 2: I reorganized her kitchen.
Speaker 1: And over did it.  So--
Speaker 2: So that was, when I was at AID.
Speaker 1: All right, so--
Speaker 2: I stayed there until January of '84 [1984] until about October of '85 [1985].
Story_ID: 34281
Speaker 1: Okay, in '85 [1985], you became Director of FEMA [Federal Emergency Management Agency]?
Speaker 2: I became Director of FEMA.
Speaker 1: Newly formed.  Was FEMA newly formed then?
Speaker 2: FEMA had--I was the third director.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, it says on the outline, newly formed.  I don't think it's--
Speaker 2: And the guy I followed got fired.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 34301
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were talking in between stopping about Arlene Ackerman, the person that you brought in [to the Washington, District of Columbia public schools] and the nature of being a superintendent and how it works.  So--
Speaker 2: Well, she--Arlene was the deputy to the superintendent [of public schools] in Seattle, Washington; John Stanford, Major General, a friend.  And when I heard that he was getting involved in the schools, I was nowhere near being in the school system, wasn't even thinking about it.  And when I ended up taking over the [Washington] D.C. [District of Columbia] public schools, John called me and said, you need help.  (Laughter) Thank you, very much, John.  So he sent me a whole stack of papers, decisions that he's made, maintenance, program instruction, all kinds of things that are very helpful.  And then he said, you know, my deputy, Arlene Ackerman, probably could do a great job for you.  Would you like to interview her?  And I was interviewing for that position.  She came here, and we talked, and in August of '97 [1997], she became my Chief Academic Officer.  And when I left, I made it clear to the control board that she should be the person to take over.  And she did, stayed on for two years, ran across the same problems that I had, but she knew better how to deal with them than I.  Some of the folks on the city council wanted to also stick their hands in running things.  So she left here and went to California.  And in San Francisco [California], she became known as the Wonder Woman, getting things squared away.  She stayed out there, then went to New York and set up a program in, I think, Columbia University and was then hired by Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] as a superintendent.  And she resigned Spring of last year--I'm saying all of this because her funeral services will be, I think next week.  She went to Albuquerque, New Mexico, pancreatic cancer, and that's a killer.
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: But a good person.
Story_ID: 34302
Speaker 1: Okay, we were kind of referring, I guess, to the, there's a crisis in urban education all over the country, right?
Speaker 2: There is.
Speaker 1: Do you have any thoughts about, you know, after--I know you thought deeply about it as superintendent [of the Washington, District of Columbia public schools] and afterwards too.
Speaker 2: Well, until you can start--a major part of the problem is poverty.  And the president [President Barack Obama] put his finger on it, just at the State of the Union.  You gotta start in pre-kindergarten, and you've got to have a parent or someone to deal with that youngster so that when they go to kindergarten, they at least recognize numbers, letters, and if they've been in nursery school, they're really better prepared to go to school in kindergarten.  And then as you go up the grades, and become an active--parents being very active in their kids' education, good things happen.  But that's not what's happening.  I've been in houses in the District [of Columbia] and you cannot find a magazine, a newspaper, a picture on the wall.  You can find the biggest musical system there, video games, nothing educational.  You can find in the District, we have a large number of Title I schools.  Title I means federal aid, breakfast and lunch.  And in the District of Columbia, we have many kids who would not get anything to eat if it weren't for the schools, at least daytime eating.  But it's poverty.  Until you can do something about that, it's a very unusual child that can make it on their own.
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Story_ID: 34303
Speaker 1: Now, we always ask this question.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Active involvement in local politics, which means the schools, by the way, employment.  Unemployment hurts the minority community worse than anyone else in my judgment.  And I cannot over emphasize the role of the parent or the guardian in the education of the youngster, not just at home to reading and working with them on homework, but involved in the PTAs [Parent Teacher Association], in the schools.  The schools need the help and the parents need to be there to help the youngsters.  When I had the superintendent's job, I had partnership with, for every school, whether that's a local mom and pop store or the 'Washington Post' with a high school, even I went to the Pentagon to get some help there.  As I was running out of volunteer organizations, I went to see the Deputy Secretary of Defense for Administration who I knew.  I need some help, and I explained what I was looking for.  He had five different organizations, military organizations, that are working with us, a battalion at Fort Belvoir [Virginia] engineer, to be a partner with a school, a military intelligence unit to be a partner of another school.  And what does that mean?  That means that the commander deals with the principal to see how can we help, and the biggest help they can provide is just the presence of that uniformed person.  It makes a world of difference in a school, in a classroom, and one particular person I went to see, a fellow named Colin Powell [General Colin Powell; former U.S. Secretary of State], and he became a partner for one school, a middle school.  And it was just beautiful to see the way they worked.  He provided a colonel from his staff, that is the school that he--a retired colonel, to be in the school, working with the principal every day.  That school needed a library.  Colin went to his publisher and said, "I want you to provide assistance to this school."  "Well, what do you want?"  "They need a library." "Okay, which books?"  They need a library.  And they got a library.  Those are the kinds of things-- and Colin did something else too, which amazed a lot of people.  He lives over in Northern Virginia.  He would invite a group of kids on the weekend to his house, swim in his swimming pool or just be around.  And there were kids who had never been over into Northern Virginia.  Now, Northern Virginia is not that far from Washington [District of Columbia], as you probably know, across the Potomac [River].  Oh, by the way, that's not unusual because my driver, when I was the superintendent, was a retired police officer.  And when he crossed the Potomac, he was lost.  We're talking about just growing, growing up, being exposed to things, also, being involved.  And we cannot over emphasize the importance of community involvement, not just true for Washington.  It's true for Atlanta [Georgia], Los Angeles [California], Chicago [Illinois].
Story_ID: 34304
Speaker 1: Now, it's often been said that we have a crisis in young men today.  How does the--what are your thoughts about that in terms of the black community?
Speaker 2: I was part of a diversity commission, I think you are aware of that, in which we looked at diversity in the military, appointed by the [U.S.] Congress.  And we found a sizable number of kids, not just black Americans, but all, that were ineligible to join the military because of obesity, also because of a run-in with the law.  Also a few other things, but obesity is the biggest problem.  When I went to school a thousand years ago, we had gym classes.  We don't have gym classes these days.  When our kids grew up, not only did they have gym classes, but they also were outside playing in the streets in a backyard, basketball hoop.  What are the kids doing today?  Sitting in front of a TV, not at a library and playing silly games or worse, some of the kinds of games that could lead to shootings.  Our youngsters need to get, become active.  They need to become part of the Girls and Boys Club.  They need to have a decent outlet and, oh, by the way, I go back to that statement I made earlier about JROTC, Junior ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps].  Few of those kids get into trouble.
Story_ID: 34305
Speaker 1: Now, what would you--what are the prospects now for a young man or woman that wants to get involved in the military, that's African American?  Do you have any recommendations or any--
Speaker 2: As far as them being able to do what?
Speaker 1: Get involved in the military, joining the military on either the enlistment level or as a, through ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] and officer--
Speaker 2: Well, ROTC is the best way because that leads to commission eventually.  But when you take a look at, what are the reasons that our youngsters are not qualified, academics being one.  I mentioned overweight being another.  Run in with the law, being a third and a desire to do it, their aptitude.  It will never cease to be amazed at the way the military is able to help young Americans.  I don't think that we should be, the military should be a social organization to deal with the problems.  But if we've got a serious group that wants to get, come in and do something for themselves and for the country, that's a great way to do it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 34306
Speaker 1: Now, tell me this, when you look back over everything you've done to this point, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: My who?
Speaker 1: Legacy.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's a good question.  I, I guess I would like for the thought to be someplace on my tombstone that he cared, whether we're talking about any aspect of society, people.  I've been blessed with a tremendous troop, a superb family of four daughters and a son and eleven grandchildren and three great-grandchildren, all for which we're very, very proud.  And in every organization in which I have served, I think I left a little bit of what I think is important, and with people.  In the First Calv [Calvary] Division, in the [U.S.] VII Corps in Germany, we had major opportunities to deal with women, not just the women soldier, but women in general, the family member.  It used to be called just "dependent."  But we stopped that a long time ago because my wife [Louise Thornton] made it very clear.  I'm not dependent upon you, and then all the other women picked up the same way.  But, and they're right.  But we dealt with school teachers, Red Cross workers, librarians, soldiers, women soldiers.  Give them an equal opportunity.  A quick example.  In the VII Corps, if a woman soldier wanted to go to the hospital and see a doctor, gynecologist, she would have to go first to the First Sergeant in a company level to go on sick call.  And, of course, she had to go through the ritual, "What's wrong with you?"  No matter what she explained, then the clerk would call over to make an appointment or send her to see a dispensary, no gynecologist there, but a dispensary for medicine and had to go through the same ritual again.  And eventually, she'd go to a hospital to see a gynecologist.  My daughter or my wife, not in the military, pick up the phone, make an appointment and go.  Why don't we do the same thing for our women soldiers?  That's an example of the kinds of things we were dealing with that we corrected.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 34307
Speaker 1: Well, tell us something about your family.  I know you've been married now, sixty-some years?
Speaker 2: Sixty-five [years] as of last January.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you made reference to your wife [Louise Thornton] several times.  She's quite a--
Speaker 2: I'm, as a matter of fact, she's out today at the hairdresser, and I hope she stops by so at least you can see what she looks like.  But she is a registered nurse by training.  She has her baccalaureate degree in nursing Education.  Our oldest daughter--and we have four daughters and a son, in that order.  The oldest daughter is a pediatric nurse practitioner.  She works at Fort Myer [Florida?] as the pediatric nurse practitioner there in the hospital.  She has two daughters.  And she has three grandchildren.  The oldest grandchild is our great-grandson.  He is twenty-three [years old], 6'8", plays basketball, when he keeps his grade level up.  And when it dropped below a certain point, he stopped playing basketball because we're providing the education for him.  The Number Two daughter is a SES'er, Senior Executive Service in the Department of Treasury.  She has twins, boy and girl.  And they're doing well.  The girl is married, the boy is not.  The next child is Number Three.  She is a graduate--and by the way, all the, all the kids have their degrees, and the Number Three, a graduate from American University here in Washington [District of Columbia].  Her daughter just graduated from Auburn [University, Alabama], magnum cum laude, engineer assistance, systems engineering, rather.  She went to work a week after, she got a job offer a week after she graduated.  She worked for AT&T and apparently doing fairly well because she just got a bonus.  She'd been there less than eight months, and her salary is such that I was in the work force a long time before I got the salary she's getting now.  Number Four is a graduate, Lafayette [College] in Pennsylvania, engineer.  She's a retired [U.S.] Air Force colonel.  They have three children, twin girls and a--she has a stepson.  They all get to their degrees this coming May.  She and her husband went into business when she retired from the Air Force and set up a company, and that company has been sold twice.  And they've been involved with each of the sales, been bought by IBM and I cannot tell you what their network [net worth] is.  I know it's a lot more than I ever thought about.  And then we have the last child, a son, West Becton.  He is a medical administrator at University of Illinois at Chicago.  He is doing very well in the community.  He is a former president of--again, I'm drawing blanks, Rotary, got that.  He's also on the board of a school at Elmhurst [Illinois].  He's also on the board of a bank.  He's also a wheel in a local church.  We could not be happier about who they are, what they're doing, and we get together quite often.  And the thing which we like about it, they like each other.  When we were in Germany, we would get a call at least once a week from one of them, after they had talked to each other before making a call, which is a unique way of doing it.  Now, has everything gone smoothly?  As I tell people, we have four daughters and eight son-in-laws, which meant that some have been married more than once, except for the youngest daughter.  She says I'm with the only husband I got.  This is it. But the others--but the things we like about all of that, they were comfortable in recognizing that they gotta make a change.  And they have sufficient guts and smarts to do it.  We feel pretty good about that.  All of the girls, all of their family members, the immediate family members have graduate degrees.  Two have more than one.
Story_ID: 34308
Speaker 1: Let me just point out that, now, you received the George Catlett Marshall Medal in 2007--
Speaker 2: 2007.
Speaker 1: Right, yeah.  Now, this is, now, tell us the significance of that medal?
Speaker 2: Well, the Association of the United States Army, AUSA, provides, they give an award in the name of General Marshall, "Marshall" being the former Chief of Staff of the Army, also former Secretary of State and a few other things.  It's the highest award they have.  And I'm very fortunate to have been selected for that.  Some of the other award recipients, well, Jim Baker was just last year, the former Chief of Staff to Reagan [President Ronald Reagan].  He was also his Secretary of State and so forth.  Colin Powell [General Colin Powell; former Secretary of State] is a recipient of that, and they have a long list of solid citizens.  I was--it was rather amusing how I got that award.  I mean I got aware of it.  I was a trustee in the Association of the United States Army and Vice Superintendent, Vice Chancellor.  At a meeting for the association's Council of Trustees, the meeting got started, and the chairman of the board, Nick Chapra (ph.), Nick, who at that time was the Chairman of the Board and CEO at General Dynamics, convened the meeting and then said, "Julius, would you mind stepping out for a minute?"  Why?  Because I said so.  Yes, sir.  I go out, came right back in five minutes.  And he had just announced to the board that the committee had recommended Julius Becton to become the Marshall recipient in 2007.  And you could have knocked me over with a feather.  I think you have some pictures in that folder of the group, of the family appearing for that presentation.

Speaker 1: Now, is there an association of African American Generals?
Speaker 2: I'm not aware of an association of African American Generals.  We do have an organization called Fall Gathering in which all African American Flag Officers, Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, Marines, gather once a year for a dinner and a small program and stay in contact with each other.
Speaker 1: So these are retired officers from all the branches?
Speaker 2: These are all, active duty, retired.
Speaker 1: Oh, all, okay.
Speaker 2: All branches, predominantly, the Army because we've got more than anyone else.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you're going to an event soon in honor of--its Buffalo Soldiers' [originally were members of the U.S. 10th Cavalry Regiment of the United States Army, formed on September 21, 1866 at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas] event in Houston [Texas], right?
Speaker 2: It will be in Houston on the 23rd--22nd, 23rd, and they have twenty of us who will be there, again, predominantly Army, but there'll be Air Force, Navy, Marine Corp.  I don't think there's any Coast Guard.
Speaker 1: Okay, and this is to honor some of the soldiers?
Speaker 2: Actually, the title is we're honorees.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: What are we receiving?  I cannot answer.  I do not know.  But materially speaking, we're each gonna get a blouse, Buffalo Soldier jacket.  I know that because they asked our sizes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There's not gonna be any monetary awards because they don't have any money, and we've got a museum down there, which I have been supporting.  And my book is on display down there.
Story_ID: 34310
Speaker 1: Now, the book.  We need to mention the book too.  The book is, was published in 2008 by the Naval Institute Press.  It's called 'Becton: Autobiography of a Soldier and Public Servant' [published by the Naval Institute Press].
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: So, and how's the reception to the book been?
Speaker 2: Well, they've completed three printings.  Now, what does that mean in terms of dollars and cents, I cannot answer.  It's been a long time since I've received any royalty, and, but I'm content with that.  As a matter of fact, I'm making a presentation next week to Boeing, the airplane headquarters in Northern Virginia in which they have bought I guess a couple hundred copies of the book where they're gonna give 'em to the people or sell 'em, I don't know.  But I'm not handling--that's done, the handling is done by the Naval Institute.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I feel pretty good about that.  It's, interesting enough, if I may point out, and here's a copy of it, 300 and some odd pages.  My first draft was 885 pages, 885 pages.  And when I was looking for a publisher because I did this without having a publisher, and they said that, okay, [cutting sound].  They said that it's too long.  Okay, so I sat down.  I can cut it back.  I went from 885 pages to 910 pages, wrong direction.  I then went to my friend, Joe Galloway, who is one of my supporters in helping write that book.  He gave me a person who is an expert at editing.  And she reduced it from that 885 pages to what it is right now.  And, it's a--I started working in 1992 on that, and I finished writing it in 2007.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I was doing a few other things at the same time, I had a working job and so forth.
Story_ID: 34282
Speaker 1: All right, my name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today with The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, could you please state your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Julius W. Becton, Jr.  What was the other thing you said?
Speaker 1: And spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Oh, Julius W. Becton, Jr., Becton, B-E-C-T-O-N, "B", like in boy, -E-C-T-O-N.
Speaker 1: All right, and, sir, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: 29, June, '26 [1926], place of birth, a place called Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, two words.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is your occupation and position?
Speaker 2: I'm retired, retired from the [U.S.] Army back in 1983, retired from four other activities since then.
Speaker 1: All right, and you retired as the, as lieutenant general in the United States Army?
Speaker 2: Retired as Lieutenant General of the United States Army.
Speaker 1: All right, and, you've also been the superintendent of [Washington] D.C. [District of Columbia] public schools, the president of Prairie View [A&M] College [University, Texas] and--
Speaker 2: Yes, starting in reverse order, I was the superintendent to D.C. public schools, my last job.  Before that I was the president of Prairie View A and M University.  Before that I was the Director of Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, and before that I was the Director of Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance in the Agency for International Development [U.S. AID].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, what is today's date?  What is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is Valentine's Day, 14th February, 19--no, 2013.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're in a place called the "Fairfax," one of the few Armed Forces Retirement Communities, right across the street from headquarters at Fort Belvoir [Virginia], and our address is Fort Belvoir.
Speaker 1: All right, Fort Belvoir, Virginia.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 34283
Speaker 1: So we're continuing an interview that we started back in November [2012; session 1].  And we had discussed your retirement [from the U.S. Army] but it was, when I watched the tape, it seemed like it was too brief a discussion.  So let me go back to retirement in 1983.  How did you feel about retiring in 1983 and what was the occasion like?
Speaker 2: Well, how did I feel about it?  I spent forty years, almost forty years wearing a uniform.  And it was clearly time for me to retire.  I was retirement eligible many years before that but each job that I had caused me to, hey, I like it, and kept on doing it.  The family was delighted that I retired because they traveled quite a few different places.  Our kids in some cases went to 12, 13, 14 different schools in a--from kindergarten till they graduated from high school.  So it's, it was time to retire.  How do I feel about it?  I had planned on not having a ceremony.  And I got beat up on by family members, my staff, saying this is not for you.  This is for the people who are following you, youngsters, soldiers that you have served with, that they want to have this for you.  And so we had a large ceremony down at Fort Monroe, Virginia.  The shocking part of all of that, was a little unusual.  At the parade ground at Fort Monroe, there is a cabeel (unclear)--a flower area in front, in the middle of the parade ground.  And in the rear of that, they had assembled some people who I had not seen when I walked around.  And when it came time for the, bringing the colors forward in a parade, that was followed by the flags of every unit that I commanded and soldiers from that unit, whether with the battalion or Second and Seventeenth Calvary Squadron and 101st Airborne Division, or the 2nd Brigade of the Second Army Division or the colors of the 1st Calv [Calvary] Division, and lastly, the colors of [U.S.] VII Corps and the soldiers from those organizations.  I gotta tell you that sort of brought a lump into my throat and my wife [Louise Thornton] standing beside me was, she was a little bit in tears.  It was emotional.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it was a worth--I mean the ceremony was powerful.
Story_ID: 34284
Speaker 1: Now, at the time that you retired [from the U.S. Army in 1983], you were--I think I recall you saying there were three black lieutenant generals in the [U.S.] Army at that time.
Speaker 2: At the time I retired, there were three--one four star, Roscoe Robinson, and two three-stars, myself and Art Gregg.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Now, how do things stand now when you--did you have any idea--
Speaker 1: The Army?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, we just got the announcement of a new four-star to be confirmed once the [U.S.] Congress, the Senate approves it.  And the delightful part about that, his parents live here.  And I have known the family for many years.  As a matter of fact, I knew Vince [Vincent] Brooks [also a HistoryMaker], who is the person who'll become a four star, since he was a teenager.  So we feel pretty good about that.  In addition to that, we have two other four stars on active duty, the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army, which is the Number Two position, Lloyd Austin and the Commander of Army Material Command, Dennis Via, located in Huntsville, Alabama.
Speaker 2: Okay, so we have three four-stars now.
Speaker 1: We will have three four-stars.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right, so I just, I was asking because I just wanted to get a reflection on the state of things, you know, in the Army today, in terms of black, you know, officers--
Speaker 1: Which you (unclear) covered a lot of it.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I just wanted to try to get a, you to give us a sense of the state of black soldiers in the Army today.  Do you have a reflection on the state of black soldiers in the Army today?
Speaker 1: Actually, the military has done a great job, in my view, compared to where they were when I first became a soldier.  Today there are no restrictions on where you could be assigned, the kinds of command that you may go to, the--we find that even local communities have accepted what the military is doing, even though their culture says otherwise.  And as we discussed earlier, the biggest challenge today for the military is the, bringing women into the military and permitting them to be in combat.  They've been there all along.  But they have not had the authority to be in combat-type units such as Infantry, Armor, Artillery where you're right next to meeting the enemy.  There's been a restriction for having that and just recently, the Secretary of Defense says, basically said, we're gonna do it.  And the services have a certain length of time to make it happen.  The thing that's most important--keep in mind that the military is an all-volunteer organization.  And people cannot be assigned to places where they did not volunteer for.  But that, being as it may be, the women are gonna have the same standard as the men.  The standards will not be lowered.  And that's the important thing, and I cannot visualize many women wanting to become an infantry person to fight with a bayonet against the bad guys coming out of a fox hole, but they certainly can do many other things that takes place in a combat field.
Speaker 2: Now, what about in terms of command, are promotions--
Speaker 1: That was the reason that the military went that way because in order to become a senior officer, you have to do certain things.  And clearly, those who were in combat armed units, Infantry, Armor, Artillery, had a leg up on any other soldier from other branches, for promotion to the highest grades.  Women were precluded from that because they never had a chance to command a brigade of infantry or a brigade of armor or a division.  Now, they have the chance.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 34285
Speaker 1: Now, how do you feel about the "Don't ask, don't tell [policy]," the rescindence of that, I think a couple of years ago.
Speaker 2: I thought it was stupid when they put it in.  And I haven't changed my mind on it.  I'm glad to see that it's gone.
Speaker 1: Okay, so do you see the struggles of gays and women in the military as being similar to the struggles of black people in the military?
Speaker 2: You could draw your comparison, but the integration of the military was something that you could always tell you had blacks there because--by sight on the battlefield, and going back to the Revolutionary War, [American] Civil War, World War I, World War II, and they were there, fighting very well.  You cannot tell about quote "a gay" by looking at them.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're saying as many people have suspected, there are always gay soldiers in the military, but--
Speaker 2: I'm convinced we've always had gay in the military.  But the point is, they never came out as such, and I believe that the "Don't ask, don't tell," finally worked because the commanders exercised their prerogative to make sure soldiers did what they should be doing.  Before we had the "Don't ask, don't tell," you didn't have men and women in uniform in ranks making love.  So why would we permit the gays to do that?  So it's a practical thing.  They're qualified, and I think we've proven time and time again that they're good at what they do.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 34286
Speaker 1: So 1983, you retired and you talked about--now, this is the Ronald Reagan administration or, yeah, it's Ronald Reagan administration.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you are appointed a Deputy Director of USAID [United States Agency for International Development], is that correct?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, not nearly that high (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, it wasn't that--oh--
Speaker 2: I was the director of the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that office was charged with being a U.S. agency that dealt with foreign disasters, organizing humanitarian assistance, organizing contractors to go in and help with whatever the disaster may be.  In the African drought, I was the person responsible for organizing the efforts to bring in foodstuff to ensure humanitarian assistance on the part of the government that we're trying to help.  An example of that, there were a couple of African countries that were using food as a weapon by not providing the foodstuffs that they had to the folks that were starving.  And we were, and our efforts were to help them to see, that's not the way to do it.
Speaker 1: Okay, now countries, one country, I know you might be referring to is--well, I don't know.  I'm trying to think of the period of time, '83 [1983], it would have been Ethiopia or--
Speaker 2: It was Ethiopia.
Speaker 1: Um-hum, yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: They had foodstuffs on the docks at Eritrea.  And they were making no effort to move the food to 100 kilometers into the country to serve people who were starving.
Speaker 1: Now, is it typical for an agency like USAID to employ former military commanders as, in those positions because of the logistical--
Speaker 2: No, although my predecessor was a retired colonel, but--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was thinking, because of the logistical issues, a military person there could be--
Speaker 2: That's--it makes sense because we've had to expect the experience, but was there any effort made to get a military person?  No.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: Matter of fact, my--one point, my replacement was Julia Taft, woman.  At one time, she was director of Red Cross, I believe.  Her spouse was a deputy Secretary of Defense, and she was a super person in dealing with humanitarian assistance.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she certainly was not a military person.
Speaker 1: Okay, I see, okay.  All right, so, now, so you served in--did you have anything to do--there was a disaster in Puerto Rico, I think--
Speaker 2: Say that again.
Speaker 1: There was a disaster in Puerto Rico, I think around--
Speaker 2: No, I did not deal in disaster in Puerto Rico.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: But remember, now, I said, foreign disaster assistance.  Puerto Rico is a part of the United States.
Speaker 1: Yes, sir, that's right.
Speaker 2: And that would be assisted by another organization called Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA.
Speaker 1: Thank you, thank you.  Okay.  All right, so how long did you serve with USAID?
Speaker 2: About twenty-two months.
Story_ID: 34287
Speaker 1: And I was asked to leave [position as director of the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)] and take over, and become the director of FEMA [Federal Emergency Management Agency].
Speaker 2: Okay, so this would be 1985?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, so what were the biggest challenges with FEMA?
Speaker 1: It depends on where you wanna start (laughter).  I was the third director going into FEMA.  And FEMA had just--I won't say "fired," they caused the, my predecessor to resign, okay.  And he did.
Speaker 2: Now, who was your predecessor?
Speaker 1: Giuffrida, Louis Giuffrida.  As a matter of fact, his funeral will be held, I think, next week at Arlington [Virginia].  But the agency was in pretty sad shape when I actually took over.  I was supported in, and it's--by the way, it's a confirmation, [U.S.] Senate confirmation position.  And so I was supported by John Warner, Paul Trible, both senators from Virginia.  I was also supported by the Vice President of the United States, George Herbert Walker Bush and supported by Senator or Representative Al Gore, a fairly interesting combination of people on both sides of the aisle.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: But it was one in which they felt that they had to make a significant change.  They had to do it fast, and that took place.  And when I arrived at the agency, I made some amazing discoveries.  One, I had to deal with losing $13.8 million that was cut in the budget, not too much difference in what's going on right now, I might add.  The agency had, for the past eight months, when I got there, had no training funds, no travel funds.  They had severe morale problems.  There were two grand jury investigations taking place and more than thirty inspector general investigations taking place.
Speaker 2: That sounds like a mess.
Speaker 1: It was.  And one of the first things I had to do was to get a chief of staff because it was a different organization than what I was used to, and I needed somebody who I could turn to, who was knowledgeable and could get things done.  So I brought a person in from one of our regions in FEMA, from a region in Denton, Texas.  He came in, Bill [William] Tidball, as my chief of staff.  And we stayed together until I left.
Speaker 2: Well, it seems like, you mentioned the travel budget was empty.  I mean how can FEMA perform its duties without a travel budget, you know.  That doesn't--
Speaker 1: The travel budget I'm talking about is that for recruitment, for training, for meetings, but money for missions--
Speaker 2: Okay, were still--
Speaker 1: --that's available.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, all right.
Speaker 1: Interesting enough, I've been sort of amused at the arguments that we have about when we had the hurricane hit New York and the floods and apparently, there were--the [U.S.] Congress were reluctant to grant money to the states of New Jersey and New York to help in a disaster assistance.  I never had that problem.
Story_ID: 34288
Speaker 1: Yeah, that kind of debate is, there's--when Katrina [Hurricane Katrina] hit New Orleans [Louisiana], I know that the director [of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)], Brown [Michael Brown], his last name was, he was really criticized, roundly, for--do you have any--when you were director, what were the biggest disasters in--
Speaker 2: We had some hurricanes, but nothing of the magnitude of Katrina.  And by the way, when I talk about FEMA, I'm talking about, not the Katrina FEMA, but the FEMA that was there before.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: An aside, I was traveling in Texas, going back to my school at Prairie View [A&M University] when Katrina hit.  And when they were relocating folks from New Orleans to Houston [Texas], to the Astrodome, I happened to be driving my car by the Astrodome, and I saw this, basically mob of people getting out of buses and milling around.  So I called back to FEMA, and I knew Brown [Michael Brown] would not be there, but I wanted to speak to his deputy.  And they finally got somebody on the phone.  And I said, "Hey, I'm Julius Becton.  I'm down here in Houston." "Oh, I know who you are" was the response I got.  So, okay, fine, "Well, I don't see anyone that appears to be in charge.  I'm more than happy to assist if I can, if you want me to."  "We'll get back to you by telephone."  And that was in August, September of '55 [1955]--wait a minute, '05 [2005].
Speaker 1: '05 [2005], yeah.
Speaker 2: And I'm still waiting for that telephone call.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, yeah, he--well, the trouble he was in probably could have been alleviated had he utilized you and maybe some other resources that he didn't utilize.  I mean he was roundly criticized, you know, and--
Speaker 2: Well, the thing is, you don't use, in my view, and I made this position very clear to the vice president and to the Senate confirmation hearing people, you don't put a political hack into the job of Director of FEMA.  It's too important.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Have they followed that all along?  Not really.
Speaker 1: No.  Now, so what do you think about the handling of Hurricane Sandy, the situation that--
Speaker 2: I thought they did a fine job because they did some things which I'm surprised Brown had done.  As we--when we knew a hurricane was coming or we knew there was some disaster pending, we would move out people out to the site so that they're there assisting the state and local governments.  And by the way, that, the job of FEMA is not to take over the disaster assistance, but to be assistance to the local people and to the state and be the coordinator for federal assistance.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so that, it's an administrative role and a resource role that FEMA plays in these--
Speaker 2: Well, it's not just administrative and resources, but it's being able--we have the capacity for getting assistance which a state or local government could not get.  We were able to--I was able to go to the Department of Defense and say, I need help.  States can't do that.  They can go through the National Guard, but because I do represent the president [of the United States], that makes a big difference.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, oh, by the way, with each disaster assistance resolution, I had to make a presentation to the president, making a recommendation that this disaster be declared or not be declared.  And I never got turned down on recommendations that we made by President [Ronald] Reagan.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he trusted you to make the assessments and--
Speaker 2: Well, we--
Speaker 1: Which makes sense if you're the director of FEMA.
Speaker 2: And we were also, by the way, working in coordination with the states.  It's the state's major problem.
Story_ID: 34289
Speaker 1: Yeah, during the [Hurricane] Katrina [2005] disaster, one of the heroes of the disaster was General Russel Honore [also a HistoryMaker].
Speaker 2: I told Russ, and I've known him a long time--about halfway through his exploits down there, I said, I called him up and said, "Russ, let me tell you something.  If I were the powers, had the powers-to-be, like the president, I would give you a telephone call and say, 'General, I thank you for your service as the--a senior officer in the United States Army, but as of tomorrow, you are the Director of FEMA [Federal Emergency Management Agency].'"
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: He could do it.  (Laughter) His comment, "Don't you do that."  "Hey, you're getting the job done, but let me tell you, that's why I think you should have been on."
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, he filled the void there.
Speaker 2: He did.
Speaker 1: Certainly filled the void.
Speaker 2: And he went down with--Russ is just a basically, no-nonsense, get it done.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A lot of us are impressed with the way he, when he saw some of the National Guard folks down there with M-16s loaded (laughter), in their arms, and he had a few choice words, which I will not use, about what to do with that M-16.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a You-Tube classic, I think.  People are playing that on the internet now, you know, as we speak.  You know, they love that clip of his address to the National Guard--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --Guardsmen.
Story_ID: 34290
Speaker 1: So, what was the biggest disaster that you had to deal with when you were director of FEMA [Federal Emergency Management Agency]?
Speaker 2: Basically, floods.  Matter of fact, when, the first week I got there, Senator [John] Warner invited me to ride in the helicopter with him to look at some floods in Virginia and that term "invited" has different meanings.  But I was there.  Okay, and we flew over the flood plains, matter of fact, my first action as the director of FEMA, and landed a couple of times, talked with local people, came back.  And he said, "You need anything else?"  No, sir, we can deal with that and our recommendation was to the president--there should be a declaration declared.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what kind of assistance can FEMA offer beyond what the states can in terms of, I mean, I know we talked about the Department of Defense or [U.S.] Army.  Does the Army Corps of Engineers get involved on these--
Speaker 2: The Corp of Engineers get involved.  The Quartermaster from food supplies, usually rations, get involved.  The state National Guards get involved, and again, FEMA is not controlling them, but they're facilitating their being there.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how long did you serve as director of FEMA?
Speaker 2: I served as the director of FEMA until the election of President [George H.W.] Bush.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And at that time, I had a major problem with the chief of staff for President Bush.  He had been the governor of a state, John Sununu, and we had major differences of opinion doing some actions that we were taking to deal with a nuclear power plant in his state.  And he expected us to cut some corners to expedite the preparation of that power plant.  FEMA had nothing to do with the inside, inside the wire, but outside the wire of a nuclear power plant, we have the disaster or rather preparation for transportation, notification, alerts, communication, anything that has an impact on what's inside the wire or on the population.  If the, if there's an escape of nuclear equipment, gases or whatever, it's our job to get the area cleared.  In order to approve a nuclear power plant, we were required to make an assessment as to whether the state was prepared to do what was required, transportation, notification, etc.  And when I refused to cut some corners, he visited me a couple of times on telephone and once in person.  I did not do what he wanted done.  And he said, I'm gonna go to the White House.  "Governor, be my guest."  And he screamed at the White House, I guess, because I never heard anything more about it.  But he did make it clear that if he ever had anything to do with my being in charge, it would not be at FEMA.  And so when he came in as the vice president's--as President Bush's Chief of Staff, he made it clear, "Becton, you're outta here."
Speaker 1: Okay, this is in 1988?
Speaker 2: '89 [1989].
Speaker 1: '89 [1989], okay.
Story_ID: 34291
Speaker 1: And interesting enough, President [George H.W.] Bush didn't block him [John Sununu from not wanting Becton to serve as director of FEMA under the Bush administration], but then asked me would I consider being the president--the Secretary of New Agencies, Veterans Affairs, the old Veterans Administration.  And I was both delighted, excited about it, and my wife [Louise Thornton] was not happy at all about that.  And at the eleventh hour, I got a call from President Bush's office that there had been a change.  The job's gonna be given to a member of [U.S.] Congress who had just got defeated.  My, that turned out to be a disaster in itself.  But after that I got another call from the president's exec saying, the president would like to know would you consider being an ambassador in the Caribbean?  And it was on a Saturday when that call came in.  I was sitting in the kitchen, and I had the speaker on, and my wife said, "No, no, we're not gonna do that."  Fine, no, we're not gonna do that.  About the same time, Prairie View A and M University [Texas], my college where I was an instructor and also have my degree [B.A. in mathematics], had just removed the president.  And they were looking for a replacement.  And I got a call, "Would you consider putting your name in the hat?"  And I pointed out, hey, guys, look, I don't have a doctorate.  I know too many people down there.  "Would you mind putting your name in the hat?"  Okay, fine.  And I did, and September of '89 [1989], they got down to a very short list of two people, me and a president, sitting president from a school in Tennessee.  And I appeared before the Board of Regents, Texas A&M University System because Prairie View is part of the system at Texas A&M, was interviewed.  I went out to the campus, was interviewed by students, faculty, talked to quite a few people, and about the mid-part of November, I got the word that I had been accepted at the president [of Prairie View].  And it wasn't until December when I got down there, I found out why.

Speaker 1: All right, so we're on a cliffhanger, and you found out why that you were selected [as the president of Prairie View A&M University, Texas]--
Speaker 2: Yes, I found out why the board selected me.  The Board of Regents is like the Board of Trustees or Board of Directors of any institution.  It's made up of, in Texas, all graduates of Texas A&M [University].  They are appointed by the governor, and all the [U.S.] Army officers, retired, National Guard, but not active.  And they were looking for a "butt kicker," not an academician, their term, not mine.  And the other person was an academician.  And so, I got unanimous selection and went up to the campus.  And I should have known this before I got there, but I didn't.  Another reason that they were in dire straits, the Texas legislature had said in writing that Prairie View, you get your acts together and deal with your funding or we will put a conservator in.  And that was my welcoming to the Prairie View A and M University.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, how did you feel about that?  You're being hired as a "butt kicker."  Did you wind your foot up and get ready or did you say wait a minute.  What's going on?
Speaker 2: No, I, having been a student at the institution, albeit a non-traditional student because I was in ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] duty as a major--captain, excuse me.  But I knew about a third of the staff and faculty, which I felt was pretty good, a good going in.  And I found out quickly that there were about three different groups of people, particularly, staff and administration, about 20, 25 percent, "We don't want a soldier coming in here as the president."  And on the other side of that 20, 25 percent, "We know Becton.  He's just the right person for it.  He'll do a good job here."  And that group in the middle did not know me and are waiting, take a look, let's see what he's gonna do.  And they had rumors that we're gonna start having reveille, we're gonna start wearing combat boots.  We're gonna start saluting, all those idiotic things that people come up with on campuses.
Story_ID: 34293
Speaker 1: So, we went in [as president of Prairie View A&M University, Texas] and within--I got there in December of '89 [1989], and after making an assessment of where we were, what had to be done, in April of '90 [1990], I suspended all athletic events teams except two because the funds were being ripped off from the housing, from the dining to prop up a failing athletic program.
Speaker 2: Were the major athletic programs sucking up all the money like football, basketball, what?
Speaker 1: I did not touch women's track or cross country.  Why those two?  Cross country doesn't cost anything.  And women's track--the Prairie View coach of women's track was also an Olympic coach.  I was not about to do anything to jeopardize her status.  But I suspended baseball, basketball, football, any sport that cost money and said, when you can bring in sufficient funds to prop up your program, come on back on board.  With baseball, the major leagues provided funds.  With basketball, the NBA [National Basketball Association] did a great job propping up our basketball teams.  Football, we didn't get enough money.  So I think in the mid-part of May, I made--had a press conference, Prairie View is suspending football until we get sufficient funds.  Have you ever been burned in effigy?
Speaker 2: No, sir.
Speaker 1: I say that because in football, in Texas, that's king.  The only way I could do that, I was a graduate.  They--I had alumni, part alumni support, but we brought the program back on board in 1990, late '90 [1990] after the football season and we then went for the next eight years without winning a football game.  And it's difficult to play in the conference that we played in, Southwest Athletic Conference, with schools like Grambling [State University, Grambling, Louisiana], Texas Southern [University, Houston, Texas], Arkansas A and M [College; now, University of Arkansas at Monticello], football giants, and we didn't have scholarships, and they did.  I'm happy to say that in 1997, '98 [1998], we started winning some football games.  And it wasn't too long thereafter that we were competitive and won the Southwestern Athletic Conference, about three years after we brought it back on board.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think I remember a national story about it on CNN.
Speaker 1: That's the only school that you can read about that we set new records in NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association].  That is A, B, C, all levels and losing.  And it became a laughing thing and very unhappy with the students.  The alumni was beside themselves, but what we were able to do, we were able to get our accounting under control.  We saved the university in terms of having a conservator take over.  We did not have any impact on the scholarships, on the research that we were doing.  We had reduced some crimes on campus.  We were in good shape, and which meant that in '94 [1994] after we'd got the football back, the--everything under control, we came home.  My wife [Louise Thornton] wanted to come back to, and go back to a normal life.  You gotta remember now, in 1994, I would be in my seventies.
Story_ID: 34294
Speaker 1: So you served [as the president of Prairie View A&M University, Texas] until 1994.  Tell me this about Prairie View, what was the--most schools have a specialty or a strength.  I know, Xavier [University, New Orleans, Louisiana], for instance, pharmacy is their big strength.  What was the strength of Prairie View or one of the--or some of the strengths?
Speaker 2: We were very competitive turning out engineers, in the top two or three from HCBUs.  HCBU being "historically black colleges and universities."
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: We were at the second largest producer of black nurses.  We were at the top group of turning out teachers.  See, Prairie View is a land grant school.  Up until about five years ago, Prairie View had more black lieutenant generals equivalent, that's vice admiral and lieutenant general, than any other school, any other school.  So the reputation of the institution throughout the country is pretty good.
Story_ID: 34295
Speaker 1: Okay, so 1994, you retired from Prairie View [A&M University, Texas]?
Speaker 2: I left, we [Becton and his wife, Louise Thornton] went home to, came home back to Springfield, Virginia and was content on working on my book which I started in 1992.  And sitting at my desk at home, about the fall of '96 [1996], I got a call from some friends involved in the District of Columbia government.  The District of Columbia had just had a takeover of the government by the federal government.  And they, a Control Board--
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is the crisis that was precipitated by Marion Barry's [former mayor of Washington, D.C.] demise, right, I believe?
Speaker 2: Marion Barry is part of it.
Speaker 1: And the Control Board--
Speaker 2: And the Control Board became an authority to--
Speaker 1: Andrew Brimmer [also a HistoryMaker] and there were some others--
Speaker 2: Andy Brimmer was the chairman of the Control Board--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --and there were three other members, all volunteers, no pay.  And I got a call from Connie Newman [Constance B. Newman; also a HistoryMaker], who I'd known.  She was a member of the Control Board and Andy Brimmer, wanted me to come down and just to talk with them.  And I knew they were in trouble from the standpoint of seeing the papers, couldn't help but read, know about it.  And I assumed they were going to ask me to become a member of a board or something.  And when I got down to their office, and I had the other members of the board, and they started telling me about the school system, and I said, oh, they want me to be a member of the board, school board.  And then when one member said, "Now, when you get here, and you do this and you do that" ---"Wait, hold it, time out.  What do you mean, 'you' do"?"  I then realized they wanted me to be the superintendent [of D.C. public school].  And that was not something I had in mind.
Story_ID: 34296
Speaker 1: Well, just historically, let's stop here, and just kind of look, the D.C. [Washington, District of Columbia] school system has been a problem for a long time, and people like, I think Ruth Love [also a HistoryMaker] and, I don't know, there're about--lots of people have come here and tried to fix it and Barbara Sizemore [also a HistoryMaker], a lot of people came--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --with a lot of promise.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: And who was the immediate predecessor to you [as superintendent of the D.C. public school system]?
Speaker 2: My predecessor?
Speaker 1: Yeah, who was your predecessor?
Speaker 2: William (laughter), I gotta look at my book, but he had been there, I think three years.  And the problem which I had and every other superintendent had, in the District of Columbia, it's the only school district that has to go to the [U.S.] Congress for money.  Let me say that again.  The only school district that had to go directly to the Congress for money, which meant that I was appearing along with the city council, along with the mayor, each supporting the proposed budget.  And since that was the situation, there were 535 experts who knew my job better than I did.  If you don't believe it, ask them.  I'm talking about the members of Congress.  No other school district in the country has to do that because you have governors that can do that for you.  You have mayors, you have--but in the District of Columbia, you are making the point yourself.  And I've said many times that I believe a study of the District's public schools would be an excellent dissertation subject for a doctoral program.  We had a superintendent or as she called herself, Chancellor, Michele Rhee, who came in, almost spent three years.  And she too left.  Kaya Henderson is currently now the chancellor.  And she's a hard-charging, very sharp person, but until they make some major organizational changes, she's gonna follow the same one, I think, as everyone else has done.
Story_ID: 34297
Speaker 1: What are the endemic problems, other than the [U.S.] Congress-that's a big one, trying to get your money from Congress, but what are some of the problems with the D.C. [Washington, District of Columbia] public schools?
Speaker 2: You have in the District eight wards.  Ward, those wards that are west of the--this happens when you get to be a certain age.  I'm trying to think of the river that runs right down the center of--not the Potomac, but Rock Creek Park.  Rock Creek Park is the dividing line--everything west of Rock Creek Park is very expensive, high-powered, powerful, and what's east of Rock Creek Park is starting--decline takes place.  And we get east of the Anacostia, which is the river on the east side of the District, you've got poverty.  So Ward 7 and Ward 8 are the two very heavily poverty areas.  Ward 3 is the high area of money.  So you have that.  You have, where you have the poverty, you also have racial problems.  You have Hispanic and black Americans in many areas in the east and in the center.  You have affluent folks in the west.  In those schools that do not have gym classes, dancing classes, music classes or the arts, the PTAs [Parent Teacher Association] and the parents have the authority and the money to give the school money to bring those in.  In those schools where you have, don't have any of those things, you've got a major problem, and I believe--and I've said many times, unless you have a, the library, the arts, the music, programs that are available for kids, you can't expect that youngster to compete with the kids from the schools that have those things.  I had no problems with the students.  I had no problems with the faculty.  Of course, the faculty, I took care of that.  I made sure they got a raise--the first one they had in seven years.  But my problems were with the outside group that wanted to quote "help."  By "help", I'm talking about run the schools.  And, one last thing, the mayor, Marion Barry.  He was asked during my first, end of my first year by the press what kind of job was Becton doing.  And according to him, what he told the press, things are worse than when he took over.  And then the press came and asked me what I thought about it.  I will not get into a debate with the mayor and he--or with you guys, because you can't win that battle.  He's got more control of the bully pulpit than money for what goes in the media.  But the next time I saw the mayor, and I used to see him about once a month as a courtesy, "Mr. Mayor, let me tell you something.  When I came, the situation was as follows," and I described what I was faced with.  And I said, you--I've had less than twelve months to do--get things right.  You've been here since the early '60s [1960s], late '60s [1960s], excuse me, except for--and I stopped there because he spent time in jail during that period.  Now, who had a chance to do something about it?  So he changed the subject.  Today, we're--we speak to each other.
Story_ID: 34298
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's, this was Marion Barry's [former mayor of Washington, District of Columbia] second term when you--
Speaker 2: Second term?
Speaker 1: His second--well, period as mayor (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, he's a city council member now.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now, he's city council.
Speaker 2: Ward 8.
Speaker 1: At that point in his--
Speaker 2: He can get, he can get elected in Ward 8 any time he wants to.  He probably could not get elected as mayor again, but in Ward 8.  And the guy is good at what he does.  He supports the people.
Speaker 1: But did he, did you ever find out what his grievance was with you or did he just have another candidate he wanted to see in place of you or what was his--
Speaker 2: No, he was against me because the federal government brought me in.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was part, I was perceived as the takeover.  And the school board, they were still paid, but they had no control.
Speaker 1: So you were the choice of the committee and the--
Speaker 2: I was the choice of the--
Speaker 1: --the Control Board, right.
Speaker 2: Control Board.
Speaker 1: Yeah, which--
Speaker 2: And Andy [Andrew] Brimmer [also a HistoryMaker]--
Speaker 1: --was an interim group that ruled the city when he was incarcerated, right?
Speaker 2: Yep, he was brought in by the federal government.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And by the way, I just went to a memorial for Andy about a month ago.  He was a really decent person.
Speaker 1: So Andrew Brimmer passed a month ago?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, I didn't even know it.  That's, all right.  Sorry to hear that.  We interviewed him, you know.
Speaker 2: Oh, you did?
Speaker 1: Yes, we did, yes, we did.
Speaker 2: He's a good person.
Speaker 1: Yes, sir, okay.  I'm sorry to hear.  So,--
Speaker 2: Hey, we're all gonna go.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, sir.
Speaker 2: And you're sitting in a place that we come here (laughter).  We got one more move to make.  That's from here to Arlington Cemetery [Virginia].
Speaker 1: I've got you.  I got it.  So, well, at any rate, so you were superintendent for how long?
Speaker 2: From November of '96 [1996] to April of '98 [1998].
Speaker 1: That's two years, and well, did you see any, were there any hopeful activities going on in the D.C. school system in those days?
Speaker 2: Yes, we did.  We had major, major maintenance problems, and I had to replace about two thirds of the roofs in the schools in Washington [D.C.] because of fire code violations, leaks and we also started taking the nationwide student tests.  And we were not doing poorly--I mean we were not doing well.  But part of it was just becoming test takers.  And things have improved but we've still got a long ways to go.
Story_ID: 34299
Speaker 1: So you think that the relationship between the [Washington, District of Columbia] school district and [U.S.] Congress has got to change for it to really--
Speaker 2: I do not see any hope for improving a great deal of things until--if the Congress were to recognize what they've set up, home rule, and then let the District control it to include, for the money, and start treating the District like a state, which I maintain is something they should have done a long time ago, it's not gonna get any better.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And you also have the other aspects.  When I started as the District superintendent [of the public school system], they had one charter school in the District.  I have no idea how many they have now.  But they have a lot of them.  And a charter school, compared to the public schools, while there're certain advantages to a charter school, when a student acts out at a charter school, they can throw him out.  When a student acts out in a public school, there's no place to go.  So, it's very simple.
Speaker 1: So the discipline problem keeps, that's impossible to solve--
Speaker 2: And we talk about, I had metal detectors at all of our high schools.  There were thirteen JROTC [Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps] programs in the District, and which I maintain is a very positive organization to have because it teaches discipline.  It teaches attention to details, and every principal that has JROTC will tell you that the students are better, that participate in JROTC.  And I even had citizens who would appear before congressional hearings when we were talking about money and complain about having ROTCs in our public high schools.  We're teaching people how to shoot or teaching people to be gangs.  These are comments that are made by good citizens.
Speaker 1: Well, don't they know we already have gangs in (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Hey, all I can--well, I can truthfully say that the [U.S.] Senate, the senators that I appeared before were understanding, supportive, except in one case, I had the chairman of one of the subcommittees that let it be known to his staff that Becton should not be the superintendent.  And I'm appearing before this committee and before I even get there, this comes back to me, or my staff.  And I didn't understand why.  And so I finally went to see a friend of mine, another senator--I guess I can mention his name because he is running now to be Secretary of Defense, Chuck Hagel, and a friend.  I said, Chuck, I really need some help.  This guy, your fellow senator has said that I should not be the superintendent.  I don't understand why.  I'll take care of it, and I come to find out that this particular senator's wife was a teacher.  And she felt that no general should be running a school system.  We got to be very good friends after we had an understanding and after Chuck intervened.  But those kind of misconceptions, preconceived ideas, and enough bad things are gonna happen at school without having to deal with those.
Story_ID: 34300
Speaker 1: What happened after you left the [Washington, District of Columbia] school system [as superintendent of schools] in '98 [1998]?
Speaker 2: After I left the school system, my bride [Louise Thornton] said, you take another job like that, we may not be together for our next anniversary.  I left the schools in '98 [1998].  Okay now, my marriage goes back to '48 [1948], which meant that I'd been married about 40, 61 [unclear] years--what am I talking about?  Whatever the arithmetic may be, but I'm happy to say, we celebrated our sixty-fifth anniversary last month.  So I'm not the smartest guy in the world, but I'm not stupid.  And I'll never take another job like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so I take it you've enjoyed retirement, I guess, as such?
Speaker 2: I did.  I was also on several corporate boards which took care of the funding that people thought that I should be accompanied to live on--should have an opportunity to live like.  General Dynamics would be one of the boards.  Illinois Tool Works, another one, Wackenhut being a third.  And so those are things that keep you busy, and I'm happy to say that as of August of last year, I have terminated all of my boards.  And I have terminated my being on commissions, all except one pro bono board is a K through 12 [kindergarten through twelfth grade] system that, of the fifteen board members, I got seven of them involved to include the chairman.  So I felt it wouldn't be right to run out from them.  But other than that, I'm happy, content, don't have the stress to cause problems.  We live in this great place, good neighbors, and we have fun.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 34311
Speaker 1: I was asking you off-camera about Thelma Groomes [also a HistoryMaker], who we interviewed back in 2003, I believe, and she told us about you.  She said, I have a relative who's a general [in the U.S. Army], and one of her relatives was a man named Bear Becton.  They called him Bear Becton because he was a civic leader in the community, and on the way to a meeting, somewhere in the hills in Appalachia, he was attacked by a bear, defended himself with an umbrella and arrived at the meeting--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --late which was uncharacteristic, but he said, I had to fight a bear to get here.  So they called him Bear Becton after that.  Now, that's, the--and Thelma Groomes is a great woman, brought--she brought Fannie Lou Hamer [American voting rights activist and civil rights leader] up from the South to [Washington] D.C. [District of Columbia] to introduce her to the ladies to raise money.  She did a lot of great things in the city.
Speaker 2: She has, and she also worked, did a lot of great things for Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  I am not aware of what that relationship is, that is, the bloodlines, but we were invited over to her house for lunch one day.  And we went and took a first cousin who's also in the area.  And we talked, and we've met probably three or four times since then.  As I said, she's deceased, and we regret that we were not able to go to her services.  But she has a remarkable mind, very outspoken, gets what she wants.  I think I described the person you're talking about.
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.  I thought I'd raise her.
Story_ID: 34312
Speaker 1: Now, I didn't ask you this question.  Now, when you look back at everything you've done to this point again, now, is there anything major thing that you would do differently or change if you could?
Speaker 2: Huh?  I don't think there is anything that, in which I was involved, that I would not get involved.  Even the worst job I had with superintendent [of the Washington, District of Columbia public school system], I probably would still get involved, knowing what I know now and had the job.  I would do it differently.  I would make it a major effort to get parental support because I was told when I first got the job that the parents weren't concerned, and that was an erroneous statement.  As far as the military, maybe there're a couple of jobs that I would prefer not to go to, coming out of Korea.  I think I described the fact that I went to Boston [Massachusetts] for a short time, working in an administrative battalion in which the battalion was all black, and our job was cooking for the soldiers on the post, cleaning the post up, maintenance and those kinds of things.  This is after I spent time as a combat soldier.  [U.S.] AID [Agency for International Development], I probably would go about the job of providing humanitarian assistance a little bit different because I'm smarter now because I'm more aware.  FEMA [federal Emergency Management Agency], I would try to get some changes done.  Even to this day, are you aware of the fact that the National Flood [Insurance] Program is a FEMA activity?  Every citizen is required to have flood insurance or else they cannot get reimbursed for flood damage.  And that is a FEMA program.  And I would, I tried my best as the director of FEMA to get the [U.S.] Congress to change.  They got a problem, same problem today.  If you have a home, build a home on a floodplain, which is by definition, an area that has been subject to a hundred-year flood, and you build a house in that area, and a flood comes in and cause damage, you have a case to go and request reimbursement funds.  I tried to get the Congress, to convince the Congress, why are we paying people to do something stupid?  If we know there's gonna be a flood there, why--and by the way, we're paying, backing the mortgages for those places.  Why are we paying them to go and build a place on a floodplain?  Well, as you probably know, members of Congress are--they deal in, they're partisan.  They also deal with their, people live their (unclear).  And so, they dole out the money.  I probably would tighten up on the relationship between state and the federal government in terms of what FEMA can pay for and what the state will do.  But as far as jobs or activities, no, I was a member of several boards, Florida A and M [University, Tallahassee, Florida] is an example, FAMU.  I spent about eighteen months on that board.  After Jeb Bush permitted the schools to have boards and not have one central board for the Florida programs.  I left that board because I was very unhappy with the way the board tried to run the university.  And having been a member of a university, president, I didn't have to worry about that because I didn't have a separate board.  There are too many boards that attempt to run things.
Story_ID: 34313
Speaker 1: Sports, very fortunate.  I went to college on a football scholarship, and if I had to do it over again, I probably would not have done it.  I would play football, yes, but not gone, went to college on a scholarship.
Speaker 2: Why not?
Speaker 1: Why not?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Well, when I went, I was already a veteran.  And I was old enough to recognize what comes first.  It's, there's something, there's life after football.  And I would have dedicated--which I did, more time to my studies and why I was there than in playing football.  I'm a qualified--I was a qualified official, football and basketball, pretty good at it, I might add.  Not job wise, but family wise, I would spend, I would try to spend a little bit more time with the family.  That's always gonna be a challenge.  But I believe that we're fortunate to have kids and the family that we do have.  The thing I like to talk about our family, they like each other, which we have six--five offspring and eleven grandchildren.  It's difficult to say they really like each other.  It's unusual, let's put it that way.
Story_ID: 34314
Speaker 1: Now, did your parents [Rose Inez Banks and Julius Wesley Becton, Sr.] get a chance to--how high did you go, you know, I mean--
Speaker 2: I was a lieutenant general when my mother died.  Matter of fact, she died the day before I went to work at [U.S.] AID [Agency for International Development].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And some of the old family members said she waited until she knew I got a job.  But I was the grade of lieutenant colonel when my father died.  And he had been a PFC [private first class] in World War I.
Speaker 1: Okay, I know you mentioned--I remember the early discussion in November [2012; session 1 of the interview] about the things you learned from your father when he managed that apartment complex [in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania] and I think--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --things started to fall into place in terms of, you know, how to get things done and--
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, I passed by that building just about a month ago, outside of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  It's still there.  And it's no longer an apartment.  But it's taken over by Bryn Mawr College as one of their housing.
Story_ID: 34315
Speaker 1: Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I think I answered that in part by saying that "he cared."  And I think that I have soldiers today that I served with in Korea [Korean War], not many because they're gone, but people from my unit in Vietnam [Vietnam War], we still get together about once every two years, even though other commanders have come and gone.  When the division have an assembly or reunion, we're invited back.  That tells you something about the organization and also something about the people in the unit.  And I'm happy to say that, and my soldiers have made it very clear that if we went to war tomorrow, they'd wanna go with the same people.  That's a compliment.  Another example about that, one of my soldiers who I've mentioned before, Gordon Sullivan, he is a Chief of Staff in the [U.S] Army, was, makes no bones about it that, when he's asked the question or when he can volunteer it, he said, there're five people in his life, in his--there're five people in his life that have made a difference, his father, his wife, Carl Vuono, who was another Chief of Staff, another officer and Julius Becton.  That's pretty high praise.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, thank you very much for sharing with us.
Speaker 2: Well, (laughter) thank you.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 34316
Speaker 1: That one I recognize.
Speaker 2: Okay, go ahead and tell us about it.
Speaker 1: That was on the 29th day of January, 1948.  And it's our wedding picture.  The young lady in front is a cousin whose name I cannot recall right now.  And you have me and the former Louise Thornton [Becton's wife].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That is a picture of our family and may I--so I can see what--we are in Verdon, France.  And those are the four daughters that we have, wife and I'm in the background.
Speaker 2: That is a picture taken at Arlington [Arlington]--in Old Town, and it's--I don't know whether it's a birthday or not, but that's me in front with Louise in front and our four daughters and two son-in-laws.
Speaker 1: Do you wanna name them from left to right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, from left to right, you have Joyce and next to her is her husband, Art, and in front of them is her daughter Joslyn.  And in the white coat is our Number Two daughter, Karen and to her left is our youngest daughter Renee and behind her, son-in-law, Frank and their twin daughters.  And to prove a point, the closest to Frank is Amber, and furthest from front is Michele, and I think I said they're graduating from, they'll be graduating this coming May.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's from Cedarville, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: This is a book signing, and--
Speaker 2: Is that 2008 when the book came out?
Speaker 1: Is that 2008--that's the book, yeah, but I'm trying to get--it was at a PX, and I'm not too sure which PX it is.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's Military where they put the Military time on the banner.
Speaker 2: Yep, and that's--
Speaker 1: That's the book (unclear).  That's the book published in 2008, right?
Speaker 2: Published in 2007.

And going across the front, from left to right, son, West, daughter, Joyce, myself, my wife, Louise, Shirley, is our oldest daughter, Renee is next, and the last one is Karen.  The back row, their daughters, granddaughters (laughter).  We've got--the tallest fellow back there coming from the left is the 6'8" [six feet, eight inches; height], and going to the right, the extreme right, is the husband of our third granddaughter.  Interesting enough, he was born in Baghdad [Iraq], and during the Iraqi evasion, we had some interesting times talking about it.  And as you can see, we have biracial members in the family, and it's a very close-knit group.
Speaker 1: That's me, my mother [Rose Inez Banks] and my brother [Joe William Becton].  He said, where is it taken?  I think outside of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] some place.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's Lieutenant Julius Becton and Ms. Louise Thornton.  It was taken in Apollo in New York, that is, the theater, Apollo, restaurant, I should say.  And that's where we're, I was spending some of my money I got when I was between active duty and going to college.
Speaker 2: Those are my parents, mother and father, Rose Becton and Julius [Wesley] Becton [Sr.].  At the back of it is where we live, apartment building [in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania], and my father, I think I mentioned was the janitor.
Speaker 1: That's that youngster again, Julius Becton and one Louise Thornton, also at that same Bryn Mawr Court.
Speaker 2: That's a mule for those who don't recognize it.  My brother is sitting in front of me.  And behind the mule is the house.  Note that it is off the ground.  And if you go back beyond the house and off to the right, you'll see the outhouse.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Some of you may not know what that is.  I'll be more than happy to explain what an outhouse is.
Speaker 1: Did you give your brother's name?
Speaker 2: Oh, Joe.  Joseph William.
Speaker 1: And the mule (laughter)?
Speaker 2: I have no idea.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: That was a picture when I was leaving commander of 1st Calv [Calvary] Division [U.S. Army].  And I was escorted off post by a mule-drawn wagon and division band behind that, and the calv trooper, that's the attire they wore.  You see two of them mounted back with their Stetsons.  That was the day I left command of the 1st Calv Division.
Speaker 1: Is that Fort Hood [Texas]?
Speaker 2: At Fort Hood.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's in the '70s [1970s], '75 [1975], '76 [1976]?
Speaker 2: '78 [1978], no, no, '76 [1976].
Speaker 1: Okay, there you go.
Speaker 2: And I got out of that vehicle, and I marched in front of the band and in front of my staff.  We're leaving the housing area.
Speaker 1: Grandson, Julius Wesley Becton IV.  He was seventeen [years old] last week.  He was captain of the football team as a junior.  He has been interviewed by several colleges to include Annapolis [United States Naval Academy] and West Point [United States Military Academy].  And he's one of those kids who, academically, he can--he doesn't crack a book.  But I don't know where he got it from.  It didn't come from his mother or father (laughter).
Speaker 2: Could you--let me, I can't recognize from--Okay, you can put it back there now.  In the lower left-hand corner, my best man, Dr. James R. Williams, and who in the world is the woman (laughter)?  That's a girlfriend of his.  In the right is myself, my mother and my brother.  And behind is a cousin.
Speaker 1: Another picture taken down at the Old Town, a place called the Burgeree' (ph.).  And--I have to get closer to it.  From left to right, we have son and his bride, Renee and her husband, our oldest daughter and her husband, Karen, the Number Two daughter, she is unaccompanied. She is the SES'er.  Number Three daughter and her husband, and Louise Becton and her husband.
Speaker 2: That is the day that I was promoted to brigadier general.  General Palmer did the promoting, and the little fellow in the front is our son, and then going across the rear, me, Louise, my mother, Louise's mother and our two daughters, the--Renee and the one with the wild hair and the short skirt, that was supposed, that was the way you looked in the (unclear).  That's Renee and Joyce.
Speaker 1: What's your wife's mother's name?
Speaker 2: Which?  Oh, yeah, Adelaide Thornton.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my mother is Rose Banks.
Speaker 1: And that's a picture of the family, my father, myself, my mother and my father, mother, brother.
Speaker 2: Your brother, Joe, right?
Speaker 1: I'm the fellow who is sitting.  (laughter)
Speaker 2: That's our track team, state champions.  I, don't ask me the names, but the coach's name is Lincoln.  He's the one not in a uniform.
Speaker 1: What's the high school?
Speaker 2: Lower Marion High School.
Speaker 1: Lower Marion, that's right, yeah, Kobe Bryant's [professional basketball player] high school.
Speaker 2: You're right.
Speaker 1: And that's our youngest grandson, Sam and his father back there behind grinning.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, we've got a stack of these.  Now, I'm trying to get the best ones here.  I'll start with this one, the one on top.
Speaker 1: That is a ceremony taken last fall when I received the, was inducted into the Hall of Fame for the National Defense University [Fort McNair, Washington, District of Columbia].  The female is Vice Admiral, Ann Rondeau, and the person on the extreme right, former Secretary of State, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a fellow named Colin Powell.
Speaker 2: Now, who is this guy?
Speaker 1: And there is Colin Powell [General Colin Powell].
Speaker 2: And you got my good friend, Colin Powell again.  And you may have noted that he is one of the three names on the back of the book.
Speaker 1: Ann Rondeau, vice admiral, Louise Becton, and Louise's husband [Julius Becton].
Speaker 2: Is that whole stack the same event?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the same event.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Powell again.
Speaker 2: And the picture behind me is the picture that was presented and it's on display at the National Defense University as we speak.
Speaker 1: I am wearing a tie for National War College [Fort McNair], and if you note that Colin does not have his tie on, and I made a comment during my talk to bad he's not wearing his tie, and since he had the last word, he told me what I should do about it (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And that's Ann--interesting enough, I'm--she considers me to be one of her mentors.  I first met her when she was lieutenant commander.  And she's a vice admiral there.  And she retired several months ago, and I was able to get her to become a replacement, replace me in the board of trustees for the American Public University system.
Speaker 2: That is, okay, at the National Defense University, going across the front, Art Best, Joyce Best, Frank Strickland, then me, Renee Strickland, and then my wife, and then West Becton, Shirley Becton--Shirley McKinsey and Karen Becton Johnson.
Speaker 1: And last one.
Speaker 2: That's the, during the ceremony during the award demonstration.  Interesting enough, on the front row of the audience is, this fellow right next to the, you can see right next to the podium, is the chairman of the Board of Visitors for the National Defense University.  And he lives right next door to me here, small world.
Speaker 1: All right, thank you.
