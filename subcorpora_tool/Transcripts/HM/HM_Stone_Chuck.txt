Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe. I'm the interviewer today for The HistoryMakers, our videographer is Scott Stearns.
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Chuck Stone.
Speaker 1: No, Scott Stearns, (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sorry, I thought I am video--
Speaker 1: Right.  And sir, could you please state your full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: My full name (unclear) I should say is Charles Sumner S-U-M-N-E-R, Charles Sumner Stone, Junior and professionally of course I go by Chuck Stone, I've written my books and I teach under Chuck Stone and that's--
Speaker 1: Okay, and--
Speaker 2: --I use that all the time.
Speaker 1: Do you have any nicknames?
Speaker 2: Well, no just Chuck Stone, that's all, that's my nickname I guess, it, no I don't have any nickname--well, no I've had nicknames conferred upon me. I mean Newsweek magazine once referred to me as the "angry man of the Negro press" and that's the only nickname I could think of. I'm sure there're others that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You said, your mother [Madalene Chafin Stone] had a nickname--
Speaker 2: --are unprintable--
Speaker 1: --for you in the car right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, what did she call me?  I forgot what she said, my mother used to call me darkie, (laughter) she used to call me dark all the time and, and 'cause of the, oh my nickname the, the family name they call me Charlie Boy--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because my father was named Charles [Stone, Sr.], so when she would my, to distinguishing, called my father Charles or Charlie and then they called me Charlie Boy and, and my sister still calls me Charlie Boy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, your name indicates that someone in your hist--in your family had--
Speaker 2: My, my grandfather named, well my grandmother, Grandma Minnie [Stone] who had a sense of history, very intelligent woman, she named her son he was my, her, her husband was Charles Stone, my, my, my grandfather's name and but she named my father Charles Sumner Stone and she named him for Charles Sumner, the abolitionist senator from Massachusetts and there were two of them and during that time there was Charles Sumner of Massachusetts and Thaddeus Stevens, and he was so--and Thaddeus Stevens was so such an ecumenical person he had a black maid who lived with him and they said she was more than a black maid, she was, it was his, his mistress or woman or what'd you wanna call her so.
Speaker 1: Right and Sumner was martyred basically.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, he was, and he got--
Speaker 1: In [U.S.] Congress by Preston Brooks when he beat him (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --he, and he was beaten and he was caned on the [U.S.] Senate floor when he made the strong speech abdicating [sic. advocating] the abolition of slavery and so forth.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: But he was outspoken and, and I was up in, that was when I was a visiting professor at Harvard [University], I went over to Cambridge [Massachusetts] in the, in the middle the, of the [Harvard] Square there, there is a pi- a statute of Charles Sumner sitting in a chair and I felt a sense of history and, and gratification that I was named for this great man, and, and, in Cambridge and Harvard University.  And, at this one statute is one of Charles Sumner.
Speaker 1: Right, right I thought I'd, you know, point that out and the, can you give us your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Yeah, July 21, 1924, and I was born in St. Louis, Missouri.
Speaker 1: Okay, and sir what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I am a professor in the School of Journalism and Mass Communication [School of Media and Journalism] at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill [Chapel Hill, North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Okay, and you were the founding president of--?
Speaker 2: I was the founding president of the National Association of Black Journalists [NABJ] and this was in 1975, and September--
Speaker 1: And just another brief notation, I think you were the, are you, were you, you the first black columnist in a major newspaper in the United States (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, not, no really, I was, I was there and, there, I think at the time there was  Bill Raspberry [HistoryMaker William Raspberry], and The Washington Post, I was, I guess I was, (unclear), maybe the, maybe the third or fourth one, okay.  I know Bill Raspberry was a columnist and, I think Walter [E.] Williams wrote an occasional column although he was a professor at George Mason University [Fairfax, Virginia], he writes, he's a conservative person, one of our con- conservative brothers and he and I are good friends, however, and we used to be on television together and debate things about the left and the right, so--.  There, there are the now, today, in almost every newspaper, any major paper has a black columnist.  In Raleigh [North Carolina] we have Barry Saunders the Raleigh News Observer [The News & Observer], which is the paper in the state's capital and they're everywhere, you, it's rarely you don't have a black columnist today or somebody right on the op-ed page.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right now, what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is August, the 4th 1950 (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Two thousand five [2005], right?
Speaker 2: Two thousand--2005, 19-, I mean, I'm sorry, 2005.  Nineteen fifty [1950], good Lord. That's an (unclear) failure.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Two thousand five [2005].
Speaker 1: And, and where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We are now in Atlanta [Georgia], the birthplace of freedom for the South and, and where the Civil War played a important part and Atlanta is a historic city, it really is.  I say if you were to name the ten most charismatic cities in America, like San Francisco [California], Chicago [Illinois], Los Angeles [California], New York [New York], Washington, D.C., you'd have to include Atlanta, very definitely, New Orleans [Louisiana], but Atlanta is a major, metropolis.  And also, for a hub in terms of planes coming in and out, for planes going to South America, or to Miami [Florida], and other places, they come to Atlanta, first and, and then they, they, they--Delta [Air Lines] has a, it's like a staging area and they come here and then go forth but.  Well, so Atlanta's a very important city, I, I think historically, and economically today and that was one of the first cities to get a black major and Maynard Jackson, broke the barriers here and, but now it's, you got a black woman Mayor Shirley Franklin and, it's continuing to make history.
Story_ID: 267103
Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five lightweight People magazine-ish type questions we always ask (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Ok, sure.
Speaker 1: --and they only require a short answer.  The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Have a favorite food?  Yeah, I have a favorite food, wh- what's my favorite food?  I like Jamaican patties, I love the Jamaican patties, I love tuna fish sandwiches, I eat tuna fish and, I eat tuna fish, tuna fish and tomato soup, that's my occasional lunch.  But, I love barbequed chicken is a favorite food, in fact as my father [Charles Stone, Sr.] once said, "Any black man who's not a Democrat and doesn't love chicken has been tampered with."  And so, I love chicken, fried chicken, very (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Favorite color?  My favorite color is orange and my sisters, one of my sister, Anne [Marie Dowdy], her favorite is green, and my sister Madalene her favorite color was blue.  We all had favorite colors, but I love orange, I don't know why but, I love orange.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Favorite time of the year?  Yes, I do.  A very sp- very favorite time of the year, which is the most ecumenical time of the year of all, and in December, when we set, after the Jews celebrate Hanukkah in December, and, and then we celebrate Christmas and we celebrate Kwanzaa and the Festival of Three Kings [Three Kings' Day], the Spanish in December, and that is an ecumenical period. [HistoryMaker] Maulana Karenga, of course started Kwanzaa, so that's my favorite time of the year, I look forward to that.  And my second time of the year, favorite time of the year is the Easter year because both the, the Jews celebrate Passover, for Easter and the Jews, and the Christians celebrate Christmas.  I, and what the Jews celebrate as Passover, we call it communion as, as Christians, so that's another favorite time of the year because it's a period at the time of harmony between Jews and Christians and sometimes there's an exchange of pulpits, in some cities during, pulpits during those, that particular period.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yes, I have a favorite phrase which is my absolute favorite phrase, it's a one sentence by a 16th century British philosopher, Francis Bacon, and he wrote, "If a man be gracious and generous to strangers, it shows he is a citizen of the world and that his heart is no island cut off from other lands, but a continent that joins them."  And I think that I, urge my students that we should all aspire to become citizens of the world.  You're an ecumenical person if you're a citizen of the world and I, I think that's what we all need to be if we can be, and s- to get, to rid ourselves of our parochial constraints and the things that separate us from, from other people, so that's my favorite, favorite phrase.  So being a citizen of the world is a phrase that is coined by Francis Bacon, a British philosopher, 16th century [sic. Diogenes, English popularized by Bacon].
Speaker 1: Okay, there's one more, and I'd forgotten that stuff.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Favorite destination being anywhere where it's warm in January and February.  We, we go to Mexico, my wife [Louise Stone] and I go to Mexico or we'll go, sometimes we'll go to Miami Beach [Florida], but we go to Mexico and we love, love sitting in the sun when it's cold in the North.  And so, that's my favorite place any, anywhere, I, I love the ocean, I wanna be near water so I, I try to find a place that, when I, I don't go to Mexico City [Mexico], but we'll go to, to seaside resorts and, I can't think of the name, but my wife makes the arrangements, and we usually go places in Mexico.

Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, sure.
Speaker 1: --and your father's [Chuck Stone, Sr.] side.
Speaker 2: All right, good.
Speaker 1: And we--we'll start with your mother's side.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My mother's full name, well before she got married, her full name was Madalene, M-A-D-A-L-E-N-E, Mar- Martha, M-A-R-T-H-A, Chafin, C-H-A-F-I-N, Madalene Martha Chafin.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her birth, her date of birth is, January 2nd, the reason I know that is because my grandmother's birthday was January 1st, my mother's birthday was January 2nd and my wife's birthday is January 3rd, so, I was doomed to marry my wife [Louise Stone], 'cause they're all, I'm trying to think of the astrological sign, but they're, whatever it is, they're, all three of them were in that astrological sign.
Speaker 1: What is she the Sagittarius?
Speaker 2: A Capricorn--Capricorns.
Speaker 1: Capricorn.
Speaker 2: Capricorn, yeah
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they're tough people, Capricorns, yeah.
Speaker 1: What was the year of your mother's birth?
Speaker 2: January, let's see I think it was 19, 1903, I think yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Yeah 1903 it was, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay and where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Lake Charles, Louisiana.  My grandmother was born in New Iberia, Louisiana, which is the home of the Tabasco sauce plantation [sic.] and my grandmother's born in New Iberia because my great-grandmother was a sl- slave from Haiti, that was transported to the tabac- to taba- to the Tabasco plantation [sic. sugar plantation] and so, I don't, I don't know her name, but somebody in the family knows her name, I think that my, one of my sisters, sister Anne [Marie Dowdy] knew her name, but, but she, she died several months ago.
Speaker 1: So, you come from, your mother's people come from hot sauce territory?
Speaker 2: Hot sauce territory is right and I, I have an affinity, but I love hot sauce, I can't, I have a bottle in my room, I take everywhere I go, when I was in graduate school--
Speaker 1: But people say that, they, they--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I carried it in my briefcase, when I was in grad school, a little small bottle of Tabasco, I love it and I put it on everything.  I put it on eggs in the morning, when I, if I have eggs, and soup, I put it on everything and so, I don't put it in milk but I put it (laughter) in everything else--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --but I love it.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well, are there any, any stories about your mother's ancestors and, how far back can you trace 'em?  Is it to Haiti?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Is that as far back as--
Speaker 2: Haiti is my great-grandmother, yeah, that's my gran- my mother's father [James Chafin], my mother's father was half Cherokee and half Spanish and he was raised by a Cherokee woman in Virginia, and I forgot the name of the, the town, but, I don't know how they met, but, 'cause he was raised in Virginia and I guess, they and he met my grandmother [Julia Chafin] and--
Speaker 1: Where did they meet?  Do you know, where did they wind up living?
Speaker 2: They wound up living up in Springfield, Massachusetts, and the, I don't know why they went to Springfield, but they, they went to Springfield to live, I guess they wanted to get out of the South, I think and I think there's maybe one or two relatives, there's some relatives there, cousins or somebody in Springfield.
Story_ID: 267105
Speaker 1: But that's where my m- my mother [Madalene Chafin Stone] met my father [Charles Stone, Sr.] because he was a student at Springfield College [Springfield, Massachusetts].  There's a wonderful story about how he met her. My father's a World War I [WWI] veteran and they were in the trenches and they, there were artillery shells going over them, and whistling over their heads and they're lying in the trench and my father was a sergeant in World War I and this li- little guy says, "Sarge, what are you gonna do when you, you get out, when, when the war is over?" He says, "I'm gonna go back and I'm gonna go to Springfield College."  And back then, in 1918, a black guy going to college was highly unusual.  He said, "You're going to go to college?  What for?"  He said, "I wanna study business administration, he said Springfield in Mass- Massachusetts?"  My father said "Yes." He says "I've got a cousin there the Chafins, and they, and Julia is her name, my cousin.  And she has, she has eight children and the oldest one is Madale-, is a woman named Madalene, a young lady named Madalene and she was a beautiful young, young girl and, she must be about, oh sixteen or seventeen now."  My father said--he said, he said to my father, "You ought to look them up," my father said, "Okay, I will."  And there was silence and the guy said, "Negro, don't you go back there and marry my sis- my cousin."  And my father said, that's exactly what I did, he said he arrived at the house where she lives and my mother came run, came running around the front, where she had long beautiful hair, very long beautiful hair and the pigtails are flying behind, my father said, "This is where I stop." Then he met her and they were married in 1922, and I was born in 1924.
Story_ID: 267106
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Madalene Chafin Stone] talk about growing up in, now did, did she grow up in Lake Charles [Louisiana], or--
Speaker 2: No, she--
Speaker 1: --Springfield [Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: They, they moved and I don't know how old she was when they moved, to lake, to Springfield, but she really grew up in Springfield and she made, she made kind of a history.  There was a very exclusive bookstore in Springfield, called Johnson's Bookstore [Springfield, Massachusetts] and my mother was good with figures, she was very bright and she went to work there as a bookkeeper and everybody knew that this, there was a Negro woman who had been hired by Johnson's Bookstore and they used to go in there to see her when she was working there as a bookkeeper.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did, did she finish high school in Springfield and--?
Speaker 2: No.  She, she finished high school of course, and that was it.  She went--I believe she went to Bay Path Institute [Springfield, Massachusetts; Bay Path University, Longmeadow, Massachusetts] for a year or something like that to study accounting, but, I know she finished high school.
Story_ID: 267107
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's fu- full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's Charles Sumner, S-U-M like in mother, S-U-M, M-U, S-U-M-N-E-R, Sumner Stone and he was, his, he was named for Charles Sumner, the abolitionist from Massachusetts.
Speaker 1: Okay and--
Speaker 2: My grandmother had a sense of history about that, and that's why she did that.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Because my father's father's name was simply Charles Stone, he was just Charles Stone, and then sh- they named him Charles Sumner Stone and I'm Charles Sumner Stone, Jr. and my son, who's a movie director, he, he directed the movie, 'Drumline' and movies like that, but he just goes by Charles Stone, III, that's all he does.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'Drumline' was a great mov-- movie (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, it was great, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's--
Speaker 2: And you still see it on HBO--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: You know he's got another one, he's got another one coming out.
Speaker 1: It is, it's a great movie.
Speaker 2: That he just set, he just sent in the screenplay, to Hollywood, in fact it was due today, August the fourth, it was due in Hollywood.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: And he did, he did another movie called 'Mr. 3000' starting Bernie Mac.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And then he did another, the first one was 'Paid in Full,' which is a movie about a crime and that was his first movie.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what is your father's date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Father's birth is 1896, and it's, he was born in, in St. Louis [Missouri].
Speaker 1: Okay.  St. Louis, and what about your, your father's ancestors?  How far back can you trace him?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I, I really don't, I know that there was, there was a defrocked Catholic priest, somehow in my, in my father's, one of my father's ancestors, he lived with a, with a black woman and that's as far--as much as I know about it.  And there was, there was a--we had a, he had a sister and aunt who was a historian and she traced their bloodline back to this Catholic priest.  Actually he was a defrocked Catholic priest.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because he was living with this black woman.
Speaker 1: So that'll get you defrocked, huh?
Speaker 2: That will get you defrocked, yeah.  And it'll get you defrocked today (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so that, that would have been back in--
Speaker 2: The 1800--
Speaker 1: --what?
Speaker 2: The, the, no the--
Speaker 1: Was that before the Civil War or?
Speaker 2: No, I think it was after the Civil War, had to be, 'cause my father was born in 1896.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay, all right, I got you now, I gotcha.  So, can you go back any further than that?
Speaker 2: No I can't, no, I wish could but I just can't.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your grandmother was the, was the?
Speaker 2: She was a very bright woman, she, you know, and, and this is a woman who in the 19- in the 1900s when my father was in college [Springfield College, Springfield, Massachusetts], she would write him letters and she would, she was a prolific letter writer and at the end of the letter, she would write, and "Don't forget, take care of yourself, remember I love you," and she said, she said "Smile," and then she'd draw a face on, at the end of the letter with a person smiling.  And that, that's pretty hip, you know, here's this woman back in the 1900s doing something like that, and she was a very (unclear) and very beautiful person, she had beautiful black hair, she wore a part in the middle and it was soft, very soft hair and beautiful features.  But she had Anglo, Anglo-Saxon features, but br- brown skinned and very witty and the first time, I met her, I was, when I was in [U.S.] Army in the [U.S.] Air Force, I came, I went to St. Louis, I was stationed in Hondo Field [Hondo Army Airfield, Hondo] Texas and I went up to St. Louis and I was going with--I had met a young lady and I, we met in St. Louis and we stayed at my grandmother's house and that when the, the first time I saw my, my father's mother.  But she was very, just very gracious and she, the la--the girl I was dating, Althea [ph.], I had met her in Biloxi, Mississippi, when I was a cadet in the Air Force and in training and oh, we were, we, we were kinda going together, I wanted to marry her but she said no, you say you should, you, when you get out of the Army you go to, go to college, she wouldn't, wouldn't even think about it.  I wanted to marry her, she was a beautiful little creole girl, Althea Beatty [ph.], I'll never forget her, had a great handwriting and we stayed there, oh and, and my grandmother said, "Now I got a place for you, you, even though you have this bedroom here." And she expected us to stay in the same bedroom, in which we did the same bed.  So, it was, it was a lovely, lovely period in my life.
Speaker 1: So what was your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: Granma Minnie [Stone], we called her Granma Minnie, so it's Minnie Stone.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We called her Granma Minnie.
Story_ID: 267108
Speaker 1: Did your father [Charles Stone, Sr.] talk about growing up in St. Louis [Missouri] and--?
Speaker 2: Not really, he went to, he went to Wendell Phillips High School [St. Louis, Missouri], and, I'm trying to think where else did he?  No he never did s- say much about growing up in St. Louis, it was of course in that St. Louis was segregated back then, as Wendell Phillips was segregated. In fact, Wendell Phillips was, was then, segregated and I'm trying to think where else did he go?  I can't remember now that--
Speaker 1: Another high school or?
Speaker 2: No it was just Wendell Phillips, I remember that--
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: Okay, I think World War I [WWI], a lot of black people volunteered and ended up in the French Army, I think (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, they did--
Speaker 1: --initially or something.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they had to fight for freedom and then--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And then, (unclear) they, they stayed there.  He tells a wonderful anecdote, my father spoke French a little bit, he was pretty good at speaking French and he tells a story. They were marching in the, on a hike, backpacks, it was hot, it was a very hot day, really terrible and so the French women saw, le soldat noir, the black soldiers and they dug the black soldiers 'cause they were such a unique, I think they'd never seen black soldiers there. "Ah bonjour monsieur, monsieur, le son da noir. Bonjour! Comment ca va? Comment ca va?" How are you? And so on, and said it was so hot, and they said, "Ah monsieur, il fait chaud." He means it's hot, il fait chaud, C-H-A-U-D. "Il fait chaud, il fait chaud," and my father said, they all looked at him and said, "Il fait chaud, il fait chaud," and they looked in and they said, "Il fait chaud, il fait chaud," and my father said one of the soldiers said, "It sho' am ma'am, it sho' am."  (Laughter)  That's called com- cultural communication, il fait chaud, it sho' am.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.  Any other stories (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, another, there was another story (laughter) where there was this guy, a friend of his who they were stand--they were standing outside this bakery in France and I forgot the city, guy went into the store to get something and he came out and says, "Hey, any of you guys speak French?"  And the guy said, "Man I speak French."  "Is you sure?"  He says "Yeah, I speak French." So well, "Man I gave that woman a ten dollar bill for a roll and she didn't give me no change and man I know it wasn't no ten dollars and I want my, some my, I want some change."  "I'll take care of it."  So the guy walks in and says, "M--Mademoiselle, parlez vous francais, you speak French?"  "Oui parlez vous francais. Qu'est-ce que tu veux?"  What do you want?  He says "Mademoiselle, je veux savoir," I want to know, "why in the hell you didn't give this guy his change?"  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Just like that huh?
Speaker 2: I, I speak French. Oh man.
Speaker 1: So, he was, he was there, he, he was in France?

Speaker 2: Could have, could have been when, I think, I've forgotten how he went from Springfield when they met, to St. Louis, they went back to, I think, to live there, he, oh I know how I, he, he became the business manager for Poro College [St. Louis, Missouri], P-O-R-O.
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: Which was the largest black business--
Speaker 1: It's a beauty business--
Speaker 2: --owned by, business, yeah, mana- Mrs. Malone, Annie Malone was the--
Speaker 1: Yes, right.
Speaker 2: That was the owner, and my one of my sisters is named, was named for her, Annie Malone and my sister Anne [Marie Dowdy] was named for her.  But they had this huge one block building, and he be- he was her business manager and he, we lived across the street, but she, Mrs. Malone, was kinda kooky, when my father said that one night she called my fa- they called, we lived across the street on Pendleton Avenue from, from Poro College and she called my father, said, "Mr. Stone," she said, "somebody's trying to poison m- is trying to kill me and, and they're trying to put poison gas underneath the door to kill me."  And my father said, "Oh Miss Malone, no, nobody wants to bother you."  And she says "Oh no, I know they are."  She said, "You, you, you, you get little Charlie [HistoryMaker Chuck Stone], get little Charlie," which is me and, and I think I was about one year old, something like that "and you take, and bring and take Mad," my mother, "and come on over and sit with me for the night."  And so my father said, "All right," so he said, "Now I don't think nothing, nothings gonna happen."  So they bundled me up and went over and sat with her all night and my father said, he didn't think anything was gonna happen, but suppose they were trying to kill her, we'd have all been dead (laughter).

Speaker 1: When you were about one years old, your parents lived in St. Louis [Missouri] and your father [Charles Stone, Sr.] working for (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Poro Co--
Speaker 1: --Annie Malone, and Poro [College, St. Louis, Missouri].
Speaker 2: And Poro.
Speaker 1: Right?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And so--
Speaker 2: He was her business manager.
Speaker 1: But at some point he made a move to?
Speaker 2: Springfield [Massachusetts].  Well, he--
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: --he started drinking then and so she, see what she did, she did a very serious mistake, she let him go and gave him a year's leave of absence to get back on his feet, well he just stayed drunk for a year and moved to Hartford [Connecticut] and he just, he became an alcoholic, 'cause he knew that alcohol was a disease now, but he used to say it was because he was shell shocked and that's he couldn't hold a job and here's a guy, he was the first black undergraduate from Springfield College [Springfield, Massachusetts], when he finished college, he was the first black in college and I was always very proud of that 'cause I had his yearbook and then it pointed that out and (unclear).
Speaker 1: And so, did, did he ever tell any stories from the war that maybe explained why?
Speaker 2: No, he no, we didn't know, you know, he just, we didn't realize that back then, you know we didn't, (unclear) today, alcoholics is a disease, alcohol is a disease but we, he said it's was 'cause he was shell shocked and all that sort of thing but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's a term that was used in those days.
Speaker 2: I know--
Speaker 1: I had a great uncle they say was shell shocked and, it's kinda--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you don't--
Speaker 1: --general term that you don't really know what--
Speaker 2: --you have to explain ab- aberrational behavior, that's what it's used for, but it's not definitive in terms of it, trying to it, it does have any kind of physiological or physiological explanations and people--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --just don't know.
Speaker 1: --I do realize that World War I [WWI] was, in fact some say it was the most horrible of wars--
Speaker 2: That was the first world war--
Speaker 1: --we're ever had because--
Speaker 2: --we fought.
Speaker 1: --there were no rules.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: There were no rules about gas--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --poison gas and--
Speaker 2: Well the reason they didn't use, the reason they didn't use poison gas, they couldn't control the air.  In other words, they tried using it, the Germans tried using poison gas, but the wind would shift and it would come back towards them, so they didn't use it for that reason.  No, it's, you've gotta be able to control it and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a rough--
Speaker 2: Yeah, World War I was, was our first major war we fought, we'd already fought Civil War and we fought the Spanish American War, my grandfather [Charles Stone], my father's father was in the Spanish American War and so, so he served in World War I and I served in World War II [WWII], I was a navigator/bombardier.  I was one of the Tuskegee Airmen.
Speaker 1: Ok now we--were gonna get to that.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, okay.
Speaker 1: So your grandfather served in the Spanish American War?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, that's right.
Speaker 1: That's--
Speaker 2: And my father served in--
Speaker 1: --Eighteen nineties, 1890s?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And my father served in the, the World War I.

Speaker 1: My biographer, a guy named Dennis Jackson, Dennis Jackson, is a professor of English at the University of Delaware [Newark, Delaware] and he's writing my biography, he's been working on it for eight years, he's a very prominent D.H. Lawrence scholar and I was a professor at Delaware for a while and that's when he became fascinated with my background and he ca- I'd give a lecture about some of the things I've done because I've developed a certain amount of notoriety while I was in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  A group of prisoners, these were inmates on death row tried to escape and when they was cut off they grabbed six hostages and held these people hostage in the kitchen and the state troopers couldn't storm it because they, there's a cinder block, so they held them hostage for about four or five days and the ringleader Joseph Bowen, B-O-W-E-N, Jo-Jo, they call him a nickname, he, he was the ring leader and he, they were in radio, I mean, I'm sorry telephone contact, you could call into the kitchen and his mother called, Princess Bowen, tried to get him to, to surrender the hostage, he said "No, I want to execute them." So, "Well talk to somebody," and he said, "No we're gonna exec--he said we don't trust anybody."  And she ran, ran off a whole bunch of names, somebody said, "How about talking to [HistoryMaker] Chuck Stone?"  He said, "We'll talk to Chuck Stone."  I was the only one they would talk to.  I was a columnist then, and known for my outspoken views against the criminal justice system that where they had hurt blacks and criminal injustices you might say, so he agreed to talk to me and I went up to the, state trooper came by to pick me up and drove up to Graterford [State] Prison [Graterford State Correctional Institution, Graterford, Pennsylvania], and I spent two days negotiating and they finally released the hostages.  And so, the, he's, he's living in solitary confinement, he was the ring leader and this guy is strong as hell, you know, they put him in solitary confinement, no bed, you know he'd sleep on the floor naked and on the cold floor.  He was tough, very tough, wiry.  And when I was negotiating the release of hostages, he, we were talking and, he, he, we were, he was in a room about as close as you are to me we could touch each other by reaching out of hands in a little small room, dark room and he, they had, somebody smuggled in four guns, a double barrel shotgun, a single barrel shotgun, a .38 and a .22, they had these four guns.  They, and so that's why they were, somebody'd smuggled them in, they might have paid on how they got 'em but they had four guns.  But when they called me, when, when the governor's office, [Dick] Thornburgh, was governor, called, they called me to go up there and negotiate, there was nothing on the radio, that wa- that was on the radio about this.  It was a big story, full page story in Newsweek and so forth, but they didn't mention the guns and Jo-Jo said, if they ever, they, they didn't want anything about the guns to be on the radio, and if they publicize it on the radio they would kill the hostages, so they didn't, nobody knew they had guns.  So when I got there, the state trooper had bought me to the prison when I got there, Major [Donald] Vaughn [Sr.] who was the deputy superintendent, he says, "Now Chuck you're gonna go in there and you're gonna go in this little room and you're gonna negotiate, and they're holding four guns, they got four guns." And I said, "Are you out of your mind?"  Actually, I said, "Are you outta your fucking mind?  Are you crazy?"  He said, "You're not afraid are you?"  I said, "Oh no, I do this every day, to negotiate a leader with four guns, you know, are you kidding?" Man, I was really frightened, 'cause nothing prepares you for this.  But, so, I went in there and the negotiations really took me two days, I did the first and they gave me a list of demands, and the, the head of the federal prison was up there to act as an advisor and all.  It, it was a national thing.  I, I have a plaque on my wall, the one plaque I have is, I was an honor, I made an honorary federal warden by the [Federal] Bureau Of Prisons for the work I did.  But, in the negotiations it was, nothing prepares you for this and when I'm arguing, talking with Jo-Jo, and he says, "I don't need to talk to you because, you ain't worth a damn but, you're the only one I'll talk to consider your little three piece pinstripe suit, your little jive ass pinstripe suit," blah, blah.  I said and, and I said, "Jo-Jo, there's no difference between you and me."  He said, "What do you mean no difference between you and me?"  I said, "We're the same, we're, we're both black, we're both brothers." "Oh nah, you, you, you well, you're prominent," I said, "Joe, let me prove it to you.  Suppose you and I leave this prison and we're walking down the walk, there's a long, there's a long walk to the main road and as we're walking, a call goes out for a shoot on sight a black man who's wanted for murder and this black man is six feet five, weighs three hundred pounds and has a big beard."  That doesn't even, we come nowhere near that. I said, "You and I would both get picked up."  And he goes, "Yeah, bro."  And I said, "They would not say, we're gonna pick Chuck up, or gonna pick Jo-Jo." They'd pick both of us up, we've both be suspects because we're, we're black.  And I said, "So there's no difference be you and me," and he goes, "Yeah bro."  And that's the first time I reached him and then we began to negotiate, and it took me two days to do it.
Speaker 2: Now, now that's a, now what year was that?
Speaker 1: That was in 1981.
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty-one [1981], okay.
Speaker 1: The reason I remember, because that's the year I went to Northern Ireland to do a series of articles in Northern Ireland, Belfast.
Story_ID: 267112
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: No.  I don't, I don't have a child, I remember, I remember in St. Louis [Missouri] we, we were very well off, I remember I had a, a pair of indoor roller skates with rubber wheels on them, indoor roll--okay and I had a truck, I had a truck, an army truck, it was a motor--. You could wind it up, you, it was about this big and when, you could go around the floor and then I had, I had a whole bunch of toys, but I had a good childhood as I remember.  We had a maid too.  We had a maid (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In St. Louis?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had a maid.  I have a picture of her kneeling and I was about oh, two years old or three years old and she's kneeling and I, I forgot her name, but she was a maid at our house, and she took, she like babysitter and cook and stuff like that.
Speaker 1: Okay. So you were, what were you?  Maybe, four or five when you moved back to, I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I think--
Speaker 1: --the east.
Speaker 2: --I think, let's see we were about, I think I was, no see we moved back, when we moved back to Hartford [Connecticut], I think in a year or so I went into the second grade I think.
Speaker 1: So you were about six I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah, six.
Speaker 1: Six, six, yeah--
Speaker 2: Then I guess, six years old, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, we might have moved by but I wasn't ready to go to school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I remember that, I remember very vividly, we lived in a, you know, we lived among black people and I'll never forget. We were driving into Hartford and I saw this girl, it was a white girl and she had blond hair, on my way to me (unclear).  And that was the first white person I ca- saw, 'cause St. Louis was segregated, and we lived in a black neighborhood and so, I, but I'll never forget her, seeing her, her name was Martha [ph.] and she was in school with me and so the, that was my earliest memory.  But, my memory is second grade, Mrs. Kowalski [ph.], was my second grade teacher, I remember her.
Story_ID: 267113
Speaker 1: Can you describe your neighborhood and what were the, some, some of the sights, and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: In St. Louis [Missouri] or Hartford [Connecticut]?
Speaker 1: Well, be, the first one, well, let's start with St. Louis and--
Speaker 2: Sai- I remember in St. Louis, there was a alleyway, there's a alleyway behind all the houses where the, you know, they collect garbage and there'd be a horse and wagon and they'd go up and down the, this alleyway and I've always remembered that alley.  I always wanted to know, if you went to town, I couldn't leave the house, but it went up, it went up the hill and what was over the hill, I always felt that was kind of mysterious land that I could--I wanted to explore, I remember that very well, that alleyway.  And there was, it was a middle class neighborhood, but it, it was essentially a black neighborhood, 'cause St. Louis was segregated.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what about Hartford?
Speaker 2: Hartford of course, we, Hartford was not segregated, we, we moved, when we moved to Hartford, the first place we moved to was on Bedford Street, B-E-D-F-O-R-D, and we went to live with my grandmother and then we, then my m-mother [Madalene Chafin Stone] and father [Charles Stone, Sr.] moved out and we lived there until we found a house and we found a house on Pliny Street, which was 41 Pliny Street, P-L-I-N-Y.  And I, I'll always remember that because my father came home once with a radio and we, we had a new rad- and I wanted to stay up all night and listen to the radio 'cause we had the music on and I was really, really fascinated with this radio.  It was a big radio, Philco.  And then we left Pliny Street and moved to Brook Street and Brook Street, we lived in 44 Brook Street, we had a second floor apartment, a five room apartment and there were, there was a house that had four, four apartments, two on the first floor and then two on the second floor and we lived on the second floor.  No, wait a minute no, we lived on, we lived on the first floor, we was on the first floor 'cause Mrs. Bolden [ph.] lived on the second floor, Walter Bolden, the Bolden family lived on the second floor, we lived on the first floor, 'cause I remember we used to sit on the ban- bannisters and talk and so forth.  And then we moved from 44, 40, and then we moved from the 44, oh then we moved to Albany Avenue. 349 Albany Avenue, and lived across the street from where we went to church, we went to Shiloh Baptist Church, S-H-I-L-O-H, Shiloh Baptist Church [Hartford, Connecticut], and the minister there was Reverend Robert Moody.
Speaker 1: Okay, this, this is a black church right?
Speaker 2: Black, oh yeah, Baptist church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Any man that is not a Baptist or a Demo- any Black man that is not a Baptist or Democrat has been tampered with.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay, all right, or doesn't like chicken.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and doesn't like chicken, that's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right so, wh- what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: I don't know, it, of course the schools are not, were not segregated back then but I, I was the only black kid in the cl- in my class and in second grade and in fourth grade, Miss Brown's [ph.] class, fifth grade Miss Hoyt's [ph.] class and seventh grade was Miss Lace [ph.] class and it was Willie Howard [ph.], a black kid was in that class and, when I was in junior high school [Henry Barnard Junior High School, Hartford, Connecticut], Willie Howard used to beat me up, 'cause I was always with the white kids and I was in ninth grade then and he said I didn't wanna go in with the black kids and he lived in the ghetto and he, he would come up to me with all his, his boys around him and wanted, wanted to beat me up.  He was a tough little S.O.B., shorter than I was, but he was a street fighter and he was upset because I was with the white kids, but I was an honor student, I was the only black honor student in my, in the class and so I was in the class with the honor students.
Speaker 1: So, kids don't understand now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, it's not excuse for that--
Speaker 1: --the dynamics of it--
Speaker 2: Watch you, you, you know, they explain that, they express that, the phrase is you're acting white, you know, you wanna be like white people.  I said I hope so, I hope you, we all should be like white people, 'cause white people have all the power.  William Graham Sumner was a sociologist, an American sociologist once wrote, if you live a country which is run by a committee, make sure you're on the committee, and I always wanted to be on the committee.  That was my life goal, always be on the committee, 'cause that's where the power is.
Story_ID: 267114
Speaker 1: So you lived in a neighborhood that was, were you, were you the only black family in the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: No, and on Brooks Street [sic. Brook Street, Hartford, Connecticut] though there was, it was, the street was very integrated and across the street was Sonny Juliano, [ph.] an Italian family, and also Dorothy Davis [ph.], was next door to him, the black family.  I used to date Dorothy, she was tall young lady, she later had a mental thing, she had a fe- you know, there was a feeble minded strain in her family, Mother Cooper [ph.], who was, was kind of feeble minded, she'd sit on the front porch, Mother Cooper that was her, that was her grandmother, and the--and there was Willis [ph.] her son, who was feeble minded, there was Blanche [ph.] who was kinda wacky and, and then King Cooper [ph.] who was a very sau- suave guy he also had some problems.  So, feeble mindedness does run in the family and, and there's a whole history of it, biological history of feeble mindedness, the transmission of genes and so I always worried about Dorothy who I, I'd take to the dance, we'd go to proms and things like that, but I, where everybody thought that Charlie [HistoryMaker Chuck Stone] and Dorothy, one day would get married, we were such a striking couple, she was tall, she was tall as I was and we walked down the street together and so forth.  But, I told my mother [Madalene Chafin Stone], I said, "I don't wanna marry Dorothy, 'cause I think that, that thing about her in her family" and later on it, it came out in her, later on she began to act strange, she'd walk down, down town wearing miss mitch, miss matched socks and stuff like that and she eventually just, just sunk into a stupor and then she died.
Speaker 1: Did you--
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: --did you think now, when you look back at it that it might have been bipolarism or schizophrenia or something?
Speaker 2: Oh, we don't know, we don't, what, what the, probably it was the most, back then we didn't know those phrases and I didn't know those phrases, nobody talked about it, we just know that people were, weird or acting crazy and we'd say they were crazy.  I mean, Dorothy was strange, when, when she was in school when we dated, want to a, went to a couple of dances together and so forth and then I stopped dating her and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that, that doesn't, usually those mental illnesses don't kick in until adolescence.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you're right.
Speaker 1: You know, (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's when hers did kick in, exactly.  But in high school [Hartford Public High School, Hartford, Connecticut] there was no, no evidence of it and then it began to, began to show and walking down the street, you'd see her downtown, dressed very strangely, yeah, we were aware that she was having mental pro- problems we just started saying,  "Dorothy's crazy," you know--
Speaker 1: Now, now wh--
Speaker 2: --kids are like that.
Story_ID: 267115
Speaker 1: When you describe your mother [Madalene Chafin Stone] and your father [Charles Stone, Sr.], which one do you think that you, when you look at their personalities, which one do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Probably both, but more my mother, my fa- my mother than my father because my father was a scholar, I mean he was a honor student and a scholar, but an alcoholic, but a very bright man.  My father could quote [Ralph Waldo] Emerson, he could quote [Henry David] Thoreau, he could quote the Bible.  When I said to him, I said "Daddy, you always," whenever he, he was working around the house, he would always clean the house and he'd mop the kitchen and the, or he'd put the papers and bundle them up and put out to be pic- collected and so forth and I said, "You always do so much more."  He said, "Well, that's what we're, what the bible says to, whosoever would compel to go a mile, go with them twain" [Matthew 5:41].  And I never forgot that, which I passed on, on my kids, you know, you do twice as much as what you're supposed to do and that's been a mo- an incarnate part of my philosophy, doing more than what you're supposed to do, and my, my kids have done that.  Well, so that he had, he had that kind of influence on me, an intellectual influence, and even when I was in the [U.S.] Army he would write, he'd write me letters and when he was in Springfield College [Springfield, Massachusetts], he'd after I, he, after he came back and, and, to live in Springfield [Massachusetts], he worked at the Garand rifle factory [Springfield Armory, Springfield, Massachusetts] and I was a student, a freshman at Springfield College, I used to go by and visit him when I was a student there, he was, 'cause he had, he, my mother had put him out the house, because of the alcoholism and he stayed and then they came back for about seven or eight years and that's when he went to Springfield where his family was.  And got a job in the Garand rifle factory and he, my father was so brainy, he learned to read blueprints, (unclear) he learned to do that in two weeks and he was, and working at Garand, which was then, the army rifle, Garand and he learned to do that and I'd go over there and vis- when I was, I'd go by and see him, and I'd, I'd go on weekends and then, then I went in the Army, of course.
Story_ID: 267116
Speaker 1: What was the name of your grade school?
Speaker 2: Oh, high school, the first school was Arsenal [School, Hartford, Connecticut], A-R-S-E-N-A-L, Arsen--
Speaker 1: That's the--
Speaker 2: --Arsenal.
Speaker 1: That's the grade school?
Speaker 2: That's the grade school, Arsenal elementary school.
Speaker 1: Arsenal, okay.
Speaker 2: Arsenal, A-R-S-E-N-A-L, that was in, and before, and then I was in the vi--I went to Vine Street School [Thirman Milner Elementary School, Hartford, Connecticut], that was, they changed the district and that was, you know, largely very heavily white, 'cause like on, Jewish holidays, there'd be almost be nobody in the class, there'd only be about four or five Gentiles and maybe, so that, that and then that was, then from Arsenal, I went to Barnard, B-A-R-N-A-R-D, [Henry] Barnard Junior High School [Hartford, Connecticut].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And from Barnard Junior High School, I went to Hartford Public High School [Hartford, Connecticut], which is the second oldest high school in America, Hartford Public, HPHS.
Speaker 1: Okay, Hartford Public High School?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we used to sing a song, (singing) "HPHS, Hartford High, this will be our battle cry."  That was back then in '42 [1942], when I went and then, then I went in the [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 1: Now, I don't want to get to the Army yet.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But, when you were in high school, when you were in school period, what was your favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: I think English composition. I used to get A's in that and I liked English as a course, as English as a course, we read, we read Homer's Ulysses [sic. 'The Odyssey'], we read that and I remember that one because I remember Mrs. Mead [ph.] was me talking about this phrase from Homer, "the rosy fingered dawn," and she said "Remember, think of the rose-" and she drew up and like the rosy fingered dawn, was a phrase out, out of that, out of that book.  And, so those, those are my favorite courses.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then Mrs. Pratt [ph.] was my teacher in English composition.
Speaker 1: In high school?
Speaker 2: High, high school, yes, um-hm.
Story_ID: 267117
Speaker 1: Now were you involved in high school activities [at Hartford Public High School, Hartford, Connecticut]?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah very much so, I was on the track team, cross country team.  It, this is interesting because the coach of the track and cross country teams was a guy named Larry Aman, A-M-A-N, Larry Aman and we had to register to get our, to get a basket where you keep your, your sweat suit and things like that, and he was taking our names and he said "Your name?" He had his head down like that and I said, "Charles Stone [HistoryMaker Chuck Stone]." "Charles Stone," he said, "Charles Stone." He says, "Are you related to Charles Stone, Charles Sumner Stone?"  I said "That's my father."  He and my father were classmates at, at Springfield College [Springfield, Massachusetts] and so he gave me all kinds of breaks and gave me an assistantship where I could earn money and so forth, but he, he was a bachelor, but he was a brilliant coach.  Our, our swimming team was New England champions.  He, he was a great one for conditioning, but he was also coach of the track team too, track, cross country and swimming, and we were the, the track team when we were the, the track team we were Greater Hartford [Connecticut] champions.  I ran the quarter mile, which I won, that's what I was, I was undefeated and I ran the quarter mile and--
Speaker 1: Now that's a tough race (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh it is, don't tell and then it, it--
Speaker 1: Quarter mile is a tough race.
Speaker 2: When we had this Greater Hartford meet and I ran the quarter and I won and then the coach came to me, he says, he says "Charlie, we need just two points to win the Greater Hartford championship, I want you to run the relay."  And I said, "God," I said "I can't do it." It was Memorial Day, it was ho- it was hot as hell, it was really hot and I was lying on the ground.  He says "Chuck," he says "Charlie, you're the only one I can put." I said, I got Vic Ja- Jamalovich [ph.], he's the sprinter, one hundred, he was first, he would, he'd lead off, then Rob Murray [ph.] would be second. Trying to think, who?  Oh and then Bob Komonowski [ph.], would be third, he was a Polish kid, and, and I would be fourth the anchor.
Speaker 1: This was, what relay was it?
Speaker 2: It was the, you ran, you run two hundred yards, I mean you run, you run, let's see, I'm trying to think, you go once around the track and once, two, three, I think you ran a hundred yard, 440 relay, yeah, 440 relay.  So you run a hundred yards 'cause I started, I know Murray started off, I said give m- I said, "You give me a lead now goddammit 'cause I'm tired."  So, it was Murray, and then he gave it to Jamalovich, and Jamalovich give it to Komonowski and Komonowski gave it to me and man by--
Speaker 1: Was it four by one hundred yards, I mean a four by one hundred?
Speaker 2: Four by one hundred.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I took off, and they had this, we, we were high school, had this terrific sprinter, Connie, Connie, Connie Knapp [ph.], was it Connie Knapp?  I think it was, name was Connie anyway, brilliant runner he 'cause he'd won all, all the weavers hundred and 220, and I took off and I wasn't running that fast, cause I was tired and also I heard the ti- I heard ti- I turn the corner, I'm coming up the stretch and the crowd was screaming, he was right behind, right on my tail and I took off and, 'cause I was, I was kinda half jogging, I was so tired, you know, from running the quarter and, and we, as we got to the tape, he lunged and but, and, and I hit the tape and he lunged and that's why I beat him, but was that fast, but God he was, he was a brilliant runner and he was terrific.  And I s- I turned and I looked like that and I see his big black legs churning boy, look like a, like a locomotive, I said "Oh goddammit."  And, you know, as I turn I can see my mother [Madalene Chafin Stone] she was wearing a pink dress, she had a rose in her hair and she, I saw her standing there cheering, you know.  (Laughter) So I gotta win this damn thing and in, in my class book it's a picture of the four of us, the, the championship team, the four of us are, are running together and they took a picture of us together and that's in the, in th- my c- my high school class book.
Speaker 1: Now were you involved in any other clubs in--?
Speaker 2: Well, I was the, I was active in the student council and, and the, in fact in the--under my picture it said that Charlie was, was, I was in student counsel and, and I was in a couple of clubs, I forgot which were, but I, I extra cur- I was in the French club, I spoke French, taking French classes, in the French club and, I'm trying to think what else I was in.  In the class book, got a class book board, I was on the board of the class book.

Speaker 1: We were talking about high school [Hartford Public High School, Hartford, Connecticut] and what year did you graduate?
Speaker 2: Forty-two, '42 [1942].
Speaker 1: Okay 1942, and were you a commencement speaker at all (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I--
Speaker 1: Did you get a chance to--
Speaker 2: --I was, well they had, they had three offices that where they elected, a--the most outstanding people.  They had a class, a class, I forgot what the, what the title was, but this was first one and then they had a class prophet, it was a male and a female in each one and then there was a third group of the, the first one was the highest honor, the second one was the class prophet and the third one was something, and we put on a class play.  But I was the male class prophet, I was the first black to be--
Speaker 1: A male--
Speaker 2: --Class prophet.
Speaker 1: --Class prophet?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and there was a female, I forgot who the female was.
Speaker 1: Now what, when?
Speaker 2: It just--
Speaker 1: How do they define class prophet?
Speaker 2: They usually just, these are high--these are just honor, honor, this is a high honor to be elected class something, class prophet and I forgot what the third one.  I have to look in my book and find what the hell that, that third office and the first one was.  First was the highest one and the second was prophet and it was a male and female for each of, for each office. And I was the second one, I was the class prophet.
Speaker 1: Okay now, now did that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He put, he put on, he put on a play, he put on a play and then the, the three, the six people put on a play.  And I'm trying to think, Bob McManus [ph.] was the, one of the highest honor and I was class prophet, and I can't think who the third one was, what, what the office was, it just doesn't ring--
Speaker 1: Now, now were you, were you still like caught in the middle of the black students were in, you know, the white students--
Speaker 2: Actually yeah, I, I, it was, there were only, there were only sixteen black students in my class out of 616, so that just tells you what, we're two percent of the class, you know and, sixteen black students.
Speaker 1: How many honor students besides you?
Speaker 2: Let's see, oh, T. Walter Johnson [Dr. Thomas Walter Johnson, Sr.], he was an honor student, he was very bright, he, he was a, he became a doctor and then became a professor of medicine at Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee], T. Walter Johnson, and his brother C. Allen [Christopher Allen Johnson] was the, wa- he was the salutatorian in his class, he finished two years before, before T. Walter, he, and C. Allen became a doctor also.

Speaker 1: When you were a senior [at Hartford Public High School, Hartford, Connecticut], did you know where you were gonna g--oh did you write for the school paper at all?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't bother. No I didn't, I didn't, I, I didn't have any intentions, I--journalism was something I never even thought about.  I wanted to be, I wanted to go into chemistry in fact, I wanted to become a chemist, but when I went to Springfield College [Springfield, Massachusetts], and took a course in chemistry I got a C in chemistry, so I knew I could not become a chemist.
Speaker 1: Now this is after high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, after high school, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, so you graduated in four--'42 [1942].
Speaker 2: Forty-two [1942].
Speaker 1: Then you went on to Springfield College?
Speaker 2: I went to Springfield College and then I went, then I got inducted in the [U.S.] Army, World War II [WWII], I didn't finish, I didn't finish my first year, I got two thirds of the way through then the draft got me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But you knew you weren't gonna be a chemist after that?
Speaker 2: Oh, I knew that when I got a C in chemistry, no.
Speaker 1: Okay that, pretty much did you, pretty much, I guess that you'd be drafted and?
Speaker 2: Well, you know when they had the draft and I can remember, I, I can remember my, my draft number, 11-10-79-36, that was my draft number.
Speaker 1: Okay, so where, where did they, where did they take you for (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They took me from, we went to Fort Devens [Massachusetts], that's where we, this is what we call the staging area where you had to go to be inducted into the Army or some--or whatever it is that we, and we lived, I lived in Fort Devens for about, for two months, we took basic training and took something like that.  And then they sent us to Kearns Field [Camp Kearns], Utah, K-E-A-R-N-S, Kearns Field, Utah, where we took more basic training and then there were at, and what they did.  You know who they sent to Kearns Field?  They sent three of us Charles Lee [ph.], Leroy Bennett [ph.], and me, we had the highest IQ's so they sent us three on a train to Kearns Field, the idea we were gonna be prepared for something else I guess.  And, so we took training there and then they sent us to Camp Lee [Fort Lee], Virginia, a bunch of people at Camp Lee, Virginia where they had two schools, a truck, truck driving school and a cooking school and they were trying--.  They don't know what to do with these, these black soldiers.  And, I was in the truck driving school, we learned, we learned how to--you wanna know what we learned how to do?  Take a truck apart completely to get--took a truck apart and then put it back together again. You know, the engine, the engine, and then it had to start, you know, you had to, you to take, break it down, take it apart and then you had to put it back together again.  And, and you couldn't graduate until you made this engine start. Then after we did the, did that, they sent us to Biloxi, B-I-L-O-X-I, Biloxi (unclear), Mississippi.
Story_ID: 267120
Speaker 1: And while I was in Biloxi [Mississippi], I decided then that I wanted to go into the Air- [U.S.] Air Force, [U.S. Army] Air Corps, and I took the Air Corps test, and I, and I passed it, at the highest, I think it was, you had to get a f- it was from one to nine and you had to get a five in order to be accepted and I got a f- five for bombardiering [sic. bombardment], seven for navigation, and I got two for pilot training, I would have been a lousy pilot.  But so then, I knew I was headed for navigation.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, so where did you go from there, did they?
Speaker 1: Then after we, after we left Biloxi, then they, those of us who had passed the test and then we, we went to Tyndall Field [Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida], no wait a minute we went to Eglin Field [Eglin Air Force Base], Florida--
Speaker 2: Edwin?
Speaker 1: Eglin, E-G-L-I-N.
Speaker 2: Eglin.
Speaker 1: Eglin Field, Florida.  And then after Eglin Field, Florida, we went to, to Tyndall Field for gunnery, T-Y-N-D-A-L-L, Florida for gunnery and then from Tyndall Field, to Hondo, Texas where we took, we took where I became a navigator, took navigation training and became a navigator.  And, so I spent most of my time in the South. I'll never forget it, we were sitting in, in, in Biloxi, we were sitting and there was a bunch, three of us sitting in, in, in the, it was warm and sitting on the sand, in back of the barracks, and Eddie Quander [ph.], who's from Washington, D.C., he was picking up the sand and throwing it down, he says, "You know, he says there's Fort Dixon [sic. Fort Dix], Fort Dixon, New Jersey, he said there's Selfridge Field [Selfridge Air National Guard Base], Mississippi [sic. Michigan], and all these fields, in, in the North and here we are in missi-goddamn-ssippi,"  (laughter).  He said in missi-goddamn-ssippi, it was terrible.  But we survived and managed to, you know, you, the important thing, you have to survive, and, it was--
Speaker 2: You ever go overseas or?
Speaker 1: No, I never went overseas, you see 'cause, after I got my commission as a navigator, the pilots went overseas, the 99[th] Pursuit Squadron was very famous, they went overseas, and did, acquitted themselves beautifully, but the navigators, and bombardiers were being prepared because they, they did not have racially integrated bombing sch- squads so they were, had to be trained separately.  So they were preparing a 447th Bombardment Squadron or whatever you call it in Godman Field, Kentucky and then the 332nd medium bombardment group [sic. 332nd Fighter Group] in, I think that was in Selfridge Field, Mississippi, and Colonel Davis was the head of the group at Tuskegee [Army Airfield; Sharpe Field, Tuskegee, Alabama], yeah.  What's his first name, his father was a general--
Speaker 2: Benjamin O. Davis.
Speaker 1: --Benjamin O. Davis, Jr, he was Benjamin O. Davis, Jr. he was very, he was in the first class of pilots at Tuskegee, 'cause we took, we took our preflight training in Tuskegee, and the pilots, those who were being trained to be pilots stayed there and took, took the pilot training, but the navigators bombardiers went off to gunnery school and then Hondo Field, Texas, where they got there navigation wings.  But they didn't, again the bomb, the groups were not integrated so after, after I got my navigation wings, they sent us to bombardier school and I was in San Angelo [Texas], in bombardier school when the war ended, they just kept sending you around, they didn't know what the hell to do with you.
Story_ID: 267121
Speaker 1: I've heard that a lot of the black soldiers scored high on tests and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, no--
Speaker 1: --were sent around to teach or they--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: They sent 'em to school and have 'em teach 'em and just--
Speaker 2: We had one guy, I'll never forget, we had one guy who had an IQ of 145, I'll never forget it and we had some very bright guys and.  So, we'd go on these we'd fly missions up and do--up and down, we'd fly from Hondo [Texas] to Abilene [Texas] and come back and that was, that was our training and, and we, you know, you, you learned to be a nav- learned to be a navigator.  Then bombardier, with the bombardier training we had to have this big, big bombing range.  When we arrived at San Angelo [Texas], we went to the, went to the, to the mess, cadet mess, no we went to the office mess, they had lamb for lunch and then, the next day and I hate lamb, I like lamb chop--I hate lamb, went back the second day, they had lamb for lunch.  I said, screw it, I'll go to PX [post exchange] and get a sandwich, get soup, something like that and so I said to the guys, "What the hell is this lamb?" Guy says, "We been eating it for a week and a half." I said "What for?"  He said, one of the training plays--planes got off course, and dropped a bomb and killed a whole flock of sheep, the concussion killed the sheep and the colonel said, "Okay, goddamnit you guys killed it, you better eat this damn stuff."  And so they made, they gotta eat lamb for about, for about two or three weeks they been eating it for a couple weeks before we got there and I, I, so I can't stand, I like lamb chops, but I can't stand lamb, a lot of people went over to the PX, you know, you could eat, get sandwiches and stuff like that and, and, you do anything to survive.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, other stories about the war, about the World War II [WWII]?  I mean, were you involved in any of the, I know a lot of the black units, I mean the?
Speaker 2: Went overseas, yeah, no.  I never went overseas, see I, the only, only ones went overseas were the, were the pilots in the [U.S.] Air Force.
Speaker 1: But what I was gonna ask is, were you involved in any civil rights actions in, in the [U.S.] Army?
Speaker 2: No, not really.  The, the only time I got into the civil rights thing is that you could not, they had a, like a store where you could buy food and, and milk shakes, things like that.
Speaker 1: The BX, PX, like tha--?
Speaker 2: It was a PX like and so, and there was a counter there and I said, and it was a hot day, I never will forget it was a hot day and I said, "Gee I ought to go to that goddamn PX and order, and get, get myself an ice cream, strawberry ice cream soda." I love strawberry ice cream. They said, "You can't go there." Everybody said, "It's segre- you can't go."  I said "I don't give a damn, I'm gonna go there." And so I walked in, sat down on the stool and I said, "I want an ice--strawberry ice cream soda."  Woman said, "I can't serve you." I said, "Why?"  "You're a Negro." I said, "So, I don't want a Negro, I wanna ice cream soda." She goes, "I'm not gonna serve you." I said, "Well, I'm just gonna sit here, call the p-" I was fixing to get arrested, "Call, call the MP." Says "You want it that bad?"  I said "Yeah." And she was from the North, she said "Okay, I'll serve you."  I drank it and came on back and that's how you make, I was like, I drank my ice cream soda, they didn't believe it, I was the only one who broke that line.  I did that a couple of times, I did that in San Angelo also.  When I went to a store, it was so hot, I love strawberry ice cream sodas and I'd always order a strawberry ice cream soda.

Speaker 1: When did you get out of the war [World War II, WWII]?
Speaker 2: I got out in '45 [1945], in November of '45 [1945].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was busted out.
Speaker 1: And what did you do then?
Speaker 2: Well, that's when I decided to go to college, I worked for, I worked, I got out in November, and I got in--. What happened, I went by, I went to visit my old high school guidance counselor in November, when I got out, Mr. Adler [ph.], and while I was there the dean of admissions at Wesleyan [University, Middletown, Connecticut], Will Lockwood, was visiting him and now this is '45 [1945], and I said to-- Mr. Will Lockwood said, "What are you gonna do now?"  I said, "Well I'm gonna go to college, I'm gonna apply for college." He said, "Well, gee what about wa- what do you think about Wesleyan?"  And I said, "That's a rich man's school," which it was. Wesleyan, Amherst [College, Amherst, Massachusetts], and Williams [College, Williamstown, Massachusetts] were three very-- school for very wealthy, all my, my classmates, their fathers were presidents of banks and stuff like that.  And I said, "I'm gonna, I'm going to do that" and he said, he said, "Well we can use you at Wesleyan."  I said, "Why?"  He said, "There are no blacks, they're no Negroes at Wesleyan." I said "Not one Ne--?"  This is after World War II, I said, "There's not one Negro student?" He said "Not one." I said, "I'm going to Wesleyan." That's when Negroes weren't at Wesley--. There were no, no Negr- I was the only, only black on class, on campus for two years and then other blacks started coming in, but, I was the only one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I became president of Student Christian Association, co-captain of the track team, I did everything, I was all over the place.  I won the award, I won, I won, I won the Everett Bennett Rosa award for the outstanding junior in the, in the, in the school, in the college.  It was a hundred dollars, I thought it was, for me that was a phenomenal sum of money, the dean Sterling Carlson [ph.] had been a member of the OSS [Office of Strategic Services; Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)], during World War II, he had one of these pucker sour mustaches, you know?
Speaker 1: He, he was member of the?
Speaker 2: OSS, that's the Office of Strategic Services, the spies, you know?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And which is our CIA today and when he called me to his office, he says, "[HistoryMaker] Chuck [Stone]," he says, "you've done a good job, congratulations, you won the Everett Bennett Rosa award."  And he gave me this check for a hundred dollars and that was the award that I won, as a junior.  As I said, I, I made an impact and, there I was. And I had a white roommate, 'cause I, I had three roommates, I had one roommate, Howie, Howie Williams [ph.], blond kid with a mustache and he, he was like the, do like the mail, he delivered mail around campus, then I have three roommates who are members of the most exclusive fraternity on campus, that was Fran Massey [ph.], Dave Engel [ph.], and Bill Schab, [ph.].  Bill Schab was a Phi Beta Kappa, and they, they were gonna room together and they wanted a fourth roommate and they decided they wanted me to be the roommate and they came to see me in my room 'cause, you know, I wasn't prepared for this and they were members of the most exclusive fraternity, Phi Nu Theta, and all the fraternities were white so they asked me to be a member of the ro- of the eating clubs, I could eat there, eat there.  And they had planned to--in fact the president of the student body was a member of the, I think then later became president of Wesleyan, and Ted Etherington [Edwin Etherington] became president of the New York Stock Excha- no became, became president of the American Stock Exchange [NYSE MKT], my classmate, the president of the American Stock Exchange and then he became, he back and became president of Wesleyan.
Speaker 1: What did you, what did you major in at Wesleyan?
Speaker 2: Majored in political science and economics.  My advisor and he was the one that advised me, he was a brilliant German, Jewish professor, Sigmund Neumann, N-E-U-M-A-N [sic.], I think it's two N's Sigmund Neumann, and he was a disciple of the Max, M-A-X, Weber, W-E-B-E-R, who's a brilliant German political scientist, and I had read a couple of his books in the class and he was one of his students, Max Weber's students, and we, he had a special class where he only admitted seven students, seven students, it was an honors class and I was one of, I wanted to get into it and I got into it and only seven of us.  You had to do a paper and then you'd have a discussion once a week and you write a paper and then you deliver a paper and the people, other students critique it and so forth.  But that was the class that Sig Neumann got me in, and he's the one who advised me to str- strongly advised me to, he said, you need to go to a major, ma- school of a major metropolis, like New York [New York] or Chicago [Illinois], and he said, you, you've been, you've led a very sheltered life here at Wesleyan, now you gotta get into the real world and he suggested Chicago or New York and I didn't wanna go to New York to live and so, I applied to the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], graduate school in the department of sociology.
Speaker 1: Now what year was this?
Speaker 2: That was in 1948.  That's where I finished.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you had a degree in 1948 from?
Speaker 2: From Wesleyan, from--
Speaker 1: From Wesleyan College [sic.]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Wesleyan University, Wesleyan University
Speaker 1: Wesleyan University, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, and your major was political science and?
Speaker 2: And economics, yeah.
Speaker 1: Economics, okay.
Story_ID: 267123
Speaker 1: And I applied to University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], to go, in the sociology department and they admitted six students that year and I was one of the six.  Classes were small and--
Speaker 2: Was Robert Parks [sic. Robert E. Park] still there in those days?
Speaker 1: No he wasn't, but he was the founder, he was the founder of, well you know about Parks, he's the founder of American sociology, he'd studied in Germany, Robert Parks was there and, what was it, Ernest [Burgess], Ernest, he was a very, he looked like a, he had white hair, what was his name, he was the chairman of the department, I'm trying to think of--
Speaker 2: Not (unclear).
Speaker 1: Ernest, I can't think of his name now, 'cause he wrote me the letter accepting me and congratulating, but he was the chairman of sociology.
Speaker 2: So how did you like, the University of Chicago now, has a reputation of being a very serious school.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, it was very serious then, it work, I mean I worked my tail off, I never worked as, I never studied before, until I went to the University of Chicago, I went to grad school, I didn't study in high school [Hartford Public High School, Hartford, Connecticut], I mean college rather, I goofed off and got a B average, I was so busy having a good time.  And I was so interested in being involved in activities like cross country track and student council and, and standing (unclear) college, church and I was on the debating team, we were undefeated and, I was having fun, I was enjoying myself and studying was secondary.  And I'd go ho-I could commute, I'd go home on weekends, 'cause Hartford [Connecticut] is only eighteen miles from Middletown [Connecticut], where Wesleyan [University] is, so I'd go home on weekends and, oh and I was, it and I'd do that 'cause it was such a lonely existence being for the first year and a half, or two years being the only black on campus. I'd walk across campus and I'd see people in my class, I'd say hi, and nobody spoke to me, only one guy, I'll never forget, Jack, Jack Wilkins [ph.], tall blond guy, brilliant guy and he was a road, he was a, he was a climber, he liked to go on climbing the mountains and mountain climbing, like that.  He's the only one that knew me, very friendly and we, and one time, we actually, we gon- we wanted to have lunch together, he said to me, we're going through the cafeteria line and they had watermelon on the, on the thing. He said, "Go ahead, explode the myth and turn it down." I said, "No I love this stuff." I put it on my plate, he said, "Go on explode the myth, turn it down." I said, "No to hell with that shit. Hey, they got any fried chicken? I'll get that too."  We used, we used to kid like that, we, you know, we had, there were three or four guys were very irreverent and, so we, you know, we would do, we'd have, there was a southern kid  who used to come into our room, in our room was Fran Massey [ph.], Dave Engels [ph.] and Bill Schab [ph.], he'd come in our room then, and he'd say, then he'd talk to them and he used to watch me and they would sit there with smiles on their faces 'cause he wasn't talking to me, he was talking to them, you know, like I didn't exist as far as he was concerned, I used to hate that son of a bitch, come in my room 'cause he, he was, he had a big southern accent, and so forth, but he'd come to visit them and, and sit there and talk, and Dave, and they would sit there with smirks on their faces looking watching me, watching my reactions, which was painful but, I kept quiet, I didn't say anything.
Story_ID: 267124
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of your teachers, do any of the teachers stand out as-- (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, oh absolutely, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's, I can remember all my teachers, Mrs. Kowalski [ph.], in the second grade.
Speaker 2: Well I was talking about the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Oh, oh you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.  University of Chicago, Phil, what was his name, Phil, Philip [Hauser], he was the, I'll tell you who he was, he was, he was the acting director of the bureau of the census [U.S. Census Bureau] and I can't remember, his name was Phil, Phil something and I took a course in, I say it was in sociology, sociological, sociology of something, where we had to use figures, and this is in '48 [1948], now, he was in the class, he was the professor of the class.  He said I want to make a prediction, he said, [President Harry S.] Truman's going to win, and then the polls all had [Thomas E.] Dewey winning, in fact, I remember the Chicago [Daily] Tribune [Chicago Tribune] "Dewey Beats Truman" [sic. "Dewey Defeats Truman"] and Truman holds up that thing, all the polls showed Dewey winning, but their polls were based on the literary Reader's Digest and the Reader's Digest polls which is slanted upper class people you see?  And so when Phil told us that Tr- Truman was going to win, we all heard, ridiculous, you know?  He's not gonna win. He said, "I'll take bets from all of you."  He took bets from all, any, any amount of money, he says, 'cause he knew, 'cause he'd taken a poll that showed Truman winning. I, I, bet, I think bet five dollars, some kids bet ten dollars, twenty-five dollars, some people really had, some of these kids were wealthy, fifty dollars and so forth, took, he took all this money and bet, it must have been about twenty kids in the class and he won of course, (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, that picture of Truman standing there with the Chicago Tribune saying Dewey wins.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Dewey, Dewey beats Truman, yeah, but they, but they were using literary, this wa- this was the first example of faulting pol- polling, and then we realized you have to do, ran- what we call random sample polling and so that's why, and I learned about polling then.
