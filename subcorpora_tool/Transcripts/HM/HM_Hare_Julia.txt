Speaker 1: --My name is Loretta Henry, and I'm doing the interview.  And Scott, who I keep forgetting his last name--
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Stearns.
Speaker 1: Thank you.  Scott Stearns is our videographer.  Okay, so we're ready to start.  Thank you, Dr. [HistoryMaker Julia Reed] Hare, for joining us.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: To get started, could you please tell us your full name with your middle name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Okay.  It's Dr. Julia Hare.  That's spelled J-U-L-I-A, and it's H-A-R-E, like the rabbit, Hare.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a middle name?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.
Speaker 1: You don't?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you tell us the date of your birth and where you were born?
Speaker 2: I was born November 7th [1939] in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's a wonderful place to be away from.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: But it was in Tulsa, Oklahoma, you know, the [1921 Tulsa] race riot city.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: The oil wells and all of that, those type things.  And it's still the historic Wall Street that we often refer to as the Black Wall Street of the country.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, it's still there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Could you please tell us today's date?
Speaker 2: April 5th [2004].  This is the day Booker T. Washington was born.
Speaker 1: Oh, historic event (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Another history maker.
Speaker 1: Thank you.  Okay, and it's 2004.
Speaker 2: That's right (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, okay.
Speaker 2: --two thousand and four [2004].
Speaker 1: And the location of this interview?
Speaker 2: This is in San Francisco [California] at 1801 Bush Street, between Bush and Octavia [Boulevard]--Octavia and Laguna [Street].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your occupation, please?
Speaker 2: Well, I am an educational and social psychologist.  I also write, you know, as an author.  I'm on the lecture circuit, and I do speeches at various universities, for civic and social organizations, some religious groups, and some corporations about various entities.  If it's Women's History Month, it's on that.  If it's in February, it's Black History Month.  Or, I also do media commentaries, you know, if there's something in the news and they need a psychologist or a person who's been involved with that and comment on it.  I've been on shows such as 'Politically Incorrect [With Bill Maher]', 'CNN and Company,' C-Span, 'Ricki Lake,' just about--you name them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And whatever the topics are, we go with that.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, thank you very much.
Story_ID: 505785
Speaker 1: Okay, just to get started, I'm going to ask you five simple questions.  They're kind of People magazine questions.  So, just kind of bear with me.  The first one is: what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: If I really had to name one, it is watermelon.  I must have that almost every day.  I don't care if it's in the winter or summertime, that is my favorite.
Speaker 1: Wonderful.  And your favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: It's summer.  I don't really think that's very strange.  I love heat and just, the wintertime is not for me.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your favorite color?
Speaker 2: I would say black, I wear it all the time.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: As long as the weather is relatively warm, it doesn't matter with me.  I like going places that are fun.  I like Florida because of the heat that's there.  San Francisco [California], I feel like living here that I'm almost on vacation every day.  I'm like the tourist.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I often remind people when we're in discussions, I ask them, "Do you remember when common sense used to be fairly common?" so that we can, you know, go on from there.  Because we see things and we can see that it has been buried, and yet it used to be free.  You didn't have to go to the universities to find it.  You didn't have to look it up in textbooks; it was just there.
Story_ID: 505786
Speaker 1: We're going to talk a little bit about your background.  So, could you please tell me a little bit about your family?  Can you tell me about your mother?  And what was her name?
Speaker 2: Her maiden was Beatrice Brown.  But she married my father [Will Reed] and so it was Beatrice Reed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she was a musician, that's how we all started playing the piano, and loved playing for her church, and she would teach the students and the kids in the neighborhood how to play piano.  It was always--and even though we took piano lessons, when we got old enough she farmed us out, because she said we were beginning to play better than she could play.  But we would have to wait in line to practice on our piano, because she would train anyone who came through who wanted to find middle C to play the music.  And she was very aggressive, motivated to do things.  She was very wealthy spiritually.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Not economically, because she always taught us that the wealth comes from your happiness and what you have inside and the things that will make you happy, rather than materialistic things.  So, that was it.  She stayed fun up until her death, when she was about eighty-one.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Could you, do you know where she was born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Denison, Texas.  And I can't tell you far that was from Dallas [Texas] or what that might have been--the location of that.  But she was born in Texas, and she moved to Oklahoma when she was sixteen.  That's where she met my father, and they married there in Tulsa [Oklahoma].  But she was born in Texas.  She used to take us there to a farming area out from Denison to visit her grandfather, who still lived there, and just always wanted us to know what her childhood was like so we would have kind of an idea of where we came from, and hopefully where we were going.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How did she describe her childhood background?
Speaker 2: It was one that, certainly they didn't have anything.  They didn't have much of anything, but they did have spirituality; they had each other.  The brothers and sisters were very close.  Her father died when she was quite young.  And being the only girl, she had to help her mother [Lula Brown] with the younger brothers quite often while her mother was at work.  She just said, "Mama was a poor widow woman, and so I would help her to do things."  And she thought that probably by having worked with her brothers and the younger ones, it helped her so much in learning how to raise her own family.  And she just enjoyed that.  She enjoyed playing the piano, playing for her church, being at home--she insisted upon being at home when her children got home.  That was long before the term "latchkey" came about.  She didn't like the idea of the latchkey.  She wanted you to come home to the smell of something good, to the ambiance, to the music, the homework and all of that.
Story_ID: 505787
Speaker 1: Can you tell us something about your father?  Where was he born? What was his name?
Speaker 2: He--Will Reed.  He was born in Tennessee. Nashville [Tennessee].  And at that time, they lived in a farming area kind of outside of it, but most of the work was done in Nashville, Tennessee.  And he came with his one sister to Tulsa, Oklahoma and that's where he met my mother [Beatrice Brown Reed].  But he was raised primarily by his grandparents, because he often said that his mother was into the theater.  She liked to play on the ships--the boats, very theatrical.  And he said, "Imagine, I married a woman who had everyone in this house playing an instrument."  So, it just continued on.  So, he was very good about it.  But he worked 24/7, actually seven days a week.  And even though that included Christmas and Thanksgiving, she insisted that we wait for dinner, even if he came home at eight o'clock.  Because it was a very segregated place.  He had to work very, very, hard for almost nothing.  But my mother was one who could get a dollar out of a penny.  She knew how to stretch it.  I mean, she was so tight that she would rub the face off a penny, you know.  You know, she knew how to stretch it and make it go.  There was no such thing as "I don't have," because she believed in the tin can.  So, she always had some little extra pennies over there, even when the money was kind of funny.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What kind of work did your father do?
Speaker 2: He was, did, well, you wouldn't call that domestic work.  He was just a laborer at the train station, you know, cleaning the coaches or working with the porters when they came in, doing whatever was needed at the station.  Because there were no choices there.  There were other things that he probably would have preferred doing, but he did--at that time you didn't desert women.  He did whatever is necessary, as Malcolm [X] would say, to feed his children, and that's what he did.
Story_ID: 505788
Speaker 1: Do you know anything about your grandparents?
Speaker 2: Not really.  Only what my mother [Beatrice Brown Reed] told me and my father [Will Reed] told me about 'em.  My older sisters [Mamie Fortune, Lillie Haynes, Peggy Holloway] would know them.  But my maternal grandmother [Lula Brown] died when I was maybe two years old--twenty-two months or whatever it might have been.  But my mother would talk about her often, and would tell us a lot of things about her.  And would tell us which child reminded her of her mother, the type of music that her mother would like, and could we play that in her honor and her memory and things of that nature.  I didn't know them, but it felt as though I did.  There were pictures of them about the house.
Speaker 1: Did you know her name?
Speaker 2: Lula Brown.
Speaker 1: Lula Brown?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, her name was Lula.
Speaker 1: What about your father?  Did you know your grandparents on your father's side?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't know the grandparents.  He had only one sister, and I knew her very, very well.  Because she was more like a sister to my mother, and like a second mother to us.  But I didn't know those grandparents; my sisters did.  They died very early.  People didn't live quite as long then as they do now.  You know, there was famine and pestilence and disease, and things that they really hadn't conquered as they have now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know anything else about your family history?  Have you done any research?
Speaker 2: They--you mean in what respect?
Speaker 1: Like in genealogy.  Do you know your family roots, anything--like your great-grandparents?  Do you know anything about them?
Speaker 2: No, only the little that they could remember to tell me, that my grandfather's father was a slave.  And so, the same thing on my mother's side.  And when they were able to escape to freedom, you know, one at a time, then they were able to try to move to a larger city and a more urban area that may have been more palatable to freedom for black people.  And that was about all.  But as for having a record of them and keeping pictures of them, and things of that nature--no, we don't have that.  I certainly wish I did.
Speaker 1: You mentioned that they escaped.  Did your parents, either one of your parents have stories about that?  Or they just said that--
Speaker 2: Yes, it was very difficult.  In the nighttime they had to do as many people had to do--just sneak away at night and leave whatever they had and take whatever food they could, on them.  Because--and without shoes.  You know, whatever they were sleeping in, whatever they could escape from--you know, the terrible situations.  And then they would go to a city.  And at that time, churches and black people would take other black people in, especially--they could look at you and tell that you had escaped from something that was unpleasant.  And they would take them in until they were able to get on their feet.  And usually, they would find some kind of job.  People didn't come just to leech, and just say that I'm going to be here with you permanently.  They wanted to get started.  They really wanted something to do.  So, there was usually someone that would help.  And it was odd jobs, mostly menial labor.  And then if they would go to school and could get out of the eighth grade, then they could become schoolteachers.
Speaker 1: Okay, thank you.  Do you know anything--could you tell us something more about your extended family?  Did you have uncles or aunts who were a part of your life?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  My mother had four brothers, no sisters.  My father had one sister and no brothers.  And we enjoyed that a lot, because my mother's brothers lived in Oklahoma also.  And so, they would come up to Tulsa [Oklahoma] from a place called Muskogee [Oklahoma], which was about fifty miles away.  And they would bring things in the summertime for her to can, because they were farmers and they would grow most of the food.  That was long before all of this organic food; we didn't know how healthy we were.  We were having organic food back in those days, because what were they going to spray with?  They had no money to do all of those type things.  So we were almost vegetarians by necessity, because where was the meat going to come from?  And where were the chickens going to come from?  So, we didn't have anything like high cholesterol and these type things.  Because we had natural things that were homegrown from the ground or they were canned with very little sugar, because they couldn't afford it.  So, the family would get together.  They would come up for holidays, and we would sing the Christmas carols.  They would come for Thanksgiving, and we would sing things like 'Over the River and Through the Woods.'  Then the stories would be told.  And on Christmas Eve we would all go out to the church and sit around the Christmas tree and would sing the carols.  And we would make gifts, because we couldn't buy them.  We didn't know that they were teaching us, through poverty, to be creative people.  Not like today.  They go out and buy fifty-five toys for a child, and the next day you can't find them, because there were so many you couldn't pick a favorite.  So, we had that kind of spirit of making toys and gifts, or whatever it might be.  It didn't have to be anything big.  It could be a balloon, whatever it was.  It was the spirit of giving rather than the commodity.
Story_ID: 505789
Speaker 1: Could you tell us what your favorite--your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: I guess I was playing the piano when I was about three or four.  I would have to stand at the piano and play it.  And so, very early on in early elementary school [Booker T. Washington Elementary School, Tulsa, Oklahoma] I was playing probably for the Sunday school at about six years old.  Because at the time, not reading music, she [Hare's mother, Beatrice Brown Reed] didn't force me to read it right away, she knew the day would come.  But I could play anything that I would hear.  If a car horn would blow outside, I could tell you it's blowing in the key of G, which helped me also through graduate school at Roosevelt, the school of music [Roosevelt University's School of Music, later, Roosevelt University Chicago College of Performing Arts, Chicago, Illinois], by being able to hear those things.  But she knew that you don't go through life playing everything you hear by--just because you've heard that.  So, I had early piano lessons.  So, it taught--I was involved with playing for weddings, for churches, giving recitals, and competitive things like 'The Stars of Tomorrow.'  And so at a very early age I was a performer, was on the stage, you know, just doing things.  I always kind of liked theatrical people, although they weren't that.  My mother played, but she didn't need the footlights and that type thing.  She just wanted to play just in the gatherings.  But she had us out playing for organizations and groups.  And we didn't look upon that as child labor, because she wouldn't allow us to be paid for that.   She said, "This is a service that you give for a talent that has been given to you."  So, I'd say the early things that I remember in motivating me to move on was probably through the music.  That followed me on through elementary school, playing for little Cinderella programs or whatever we had. Junior high school [George Washington Carver Middle School, Tulsa, Oklahoma] and high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Tulsa, Oklahoma]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and marching bands and things.
Story_ID: 505790
Speaker 1: 'Kay.  Could you tell us something about your siblings?
Speaker 2: I had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was their birth order?
Speaker 2: I was the youngest.  The sister that I was very close to passed away a few years ago.  I have two sisters that live here in Oakland [California], and a brother in New York [New York].  And most of them, all but one, was a musician.  She just decided that it was too many instruments going in the house, and she said "I'll never have one of my children, you know, as a musician," but yet she married one.  She was the only one who married a musician.  We were, I would say a rather close-knit family.  My mother [Beatrice Brown Reed] didn't allow a lot of arguing and bickering.  You could have disagreements, but when it came to, you know, like touching and all of this type stuff, we didn't do that.  I notice now that every child has to have a separate room.  But there were three girls, we all slept in the same room.  Social workers now will take you out of the house if you did that.  But it was a bonding in that process, because when my mother thought we were asleep we were still gossiping and talking about what we had done that day.  We would read a lot to each other.  We had our own separate friends, though.  I had friends in my class, they had friends in their classes.  We would--every other summer, because my father [Will Reed] worked for the railroad, we would have pretty good vacations because we came from [Tulsa] Oklahoma out here [San Francisco, California].  And then on the alternate summers we would go close by to Texas or Kansas, because we could ride on passes.  So, that kind of helped to give us a geographical sense of the terrain, and where we were growing up.  So, we enjoyed that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Could you tell us their names?  I mean, your sisters?
Speaker 2: We called the one that passed away Peggy, but her name was Lula Mae Holloway.  She was married to the now president [Ernest L. Holloway] of Langston University [Langston, Oklahoma], the only black historical college [HBCU] in the State of Oklahoma.  Then there was Lillie [Haynes], the one who had about five children.  She still lives in Oakland [California].  Her children are doing very well, and so is she.  She's just enjoying her life and her grandchildren.  Then my oldest sister is a public school teacher in Oakland, and enjoys doing that.
Speaker 1: Her name is?
Speaker 2: Mamie Fortune.  And my brother, William Reed--he was named after my father--lives in New York and has always enjoyed that.  He lived in Chicago [Illinois] briefly when I was there, but didn't quite care for that.  And I thought maybe it was too large, but look at the size of New York.  He loves people because he likes the theater, he likes drama.  He's a counselor there.  He counsels people who have had problems with alcohol.  And so, he does a lot of that. Those who are into drug addiction, he still works with that.  He should be retired, but he still likes helping people.  So, he's involved with that.
Story_ID: 505791
Speaker 1: You, you grew up in Tulsa [Oklahoma]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And Tulsa has a very interesting history.
Speaker 2: Yes, it does.
Speaker 1: Very interesting.  Did your parents [Will Reed and Beatrice Brown Reed] ever talk, or did they experience the riot, the [1921] Tulsa [race] riot?
Speaker 2: No, my mother wasn't living there.  She came to Tulsa when she was sixteen.  The riot took place I think in 1921.  But my father was living there, and he would tell it to us in the house because believe it or not, did you know that black people and black teachers were afraid to talk about that riot when we were growing up in school?  Because I mean that was punishable by lynchings, or whatever it might be.  That had to be swept under the rug.  And the major newspaper of the day, the Tulsa Tribune, that fanned the flames by simply saying that a black man looked at a white woman on an elevator.  Well, by the time that hit the radio news--it was not the television--and that went out, then the riot was on.  And so, we're talking about concentration camps.  They put the black people in that.  My father said you could stand and look all across the country--the city and see everything that was burning.  Well, the [U.S.] National Guard was called out, and they locked all the black people up in something called the Convention Hall.  They locked them up, burned down the houses, destroyed the businesses.  One of the reasons that was done is because Tulsa's black community had a self-contained community.  They had black--doctors had their own hospitals and businesses.  You didn't have to go to the other side of town to purchase anything; it was all done there.  In fact, the whites had to come over to the black part of town to purchase a lot of things.  And I guess someone just did not like that.  And the papers, you know, the newspapers, really fanned that up.  And the only church that has ever been bombed from the air in the United States was Mount Zion Baptist Church [Tulsa, Oklahoma], which was the church of my youth, and the church had recently been built, but about a million bucks [dollars] back then in 1921, you know, you can imagine the value of that now.  Well, they bombed the church because they said they were destroying, in today's language, weapons of mass destruction but then they said they had an arsenal of weapons that were destroyed.  And then after they bombed the church, they later learned that there were no weapons in the church.  That church still stands, and they would like to get rid of that church now so that they can build a white university on that land, because they're trying to move now the blacks that are out of North Tulsa.  It was often said the reason why--that was the only place blacks could live. It's often said that the reason why they want them out of North Tulsa is because the hurricanes that always visit Tulsa never went through North Tulsa.  It always went through the other side of town.  And so, they were trying to move them out.  The school there that they built for blacks because of segregation, Booker T. Washington High School [Tulsa, Oklahoma], now they're trying to put all of them out and turn that school into a white preparatory school and move the blacks out of Tulsa.  I just wrote an editorial for one of the newspapers back there on that situation.  So, the reparations movement that they were trying to get for them, the State of Oklahoma ruled that it's so few of them living that we should not pass the reparations on to them or to their heirs, nor has there been an apology.  So, the city is about to go up again anytime.  Don't be surprised if you hear that.
Story_ID: 505792
Speaker 1: Describe your neighborhood, the street you lived on.
Speaker 2: I lived on a street called Latimer Place [Tulsa, Oklahoma].  It sounds like something out of 'Peyton Place,' but it wasn't.  Because growing up in Latimer Place, every parent there had a sense of discipline.  If you were doing something on that street, if you were sitting in church and you did something wrong, all your mother had to do was to glance in your direction.  Because there was a peach tree in the backyard.  And it didn't take you long to know that the peach tree was out there to do more than to bear fruit.  Now, now they would call that child abuse; they would call that beating people.  That was not the case, because they didn't have to threaten you but once with that switch, and you knew that certain things were off limit.  When you did that--we certain have a generation of people that grew up respecting other adults.  And now, they don't do that.  We did not have the fractured, dysfunctional families that we're beginning to see that's becoming fairly common.  There was no such thing as the foster care home.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because if child--if something happened in a home, another parent just took them in without going through all the red tape and the paraphernalia that social service agencies take you through now.  And quite often if something happened to the mother, the grandmother took the child.  Now, the foster care homes or the social service agencies will not let the grandmother take them in.  Instead, they'll farm the child out to a suburban community, which makes reunification with the family almost impossible.
Speaker 1: Okay.  In your neighborhood that you grew up, was the school--did you go to a school?
Speaker 2: There were schools in the neighborhood because there had to be.
Speaker 1: And there were stores and--
Speaker 2: There were stores and--
Speaker 1: --that were self-contained?
Speaker 2: There were churches there.  There were ballparks there.  There was one swimming pool--there were two swimming pools there.  They had all of that there, you know.  Because if you didn't have it there for the children, where would they have used that?  There were ballparks where the kids to get together in the summertime when they would play ball.  And then they had something called the Hi-Jinks, where they would have theatrical and musical productions.  Because you know, black folks were always creative, we can dance and sing.  And so, they would get together and entertain the adults.  And it was very healthy and very wholesome activities.  We had our own football games.  In fact, the black high school would win most of the games and all the trophies over the southwest of the country.  So, it was quite appropriate; it was very good.  And then of course, the Brown v. Board [of Education of Topeka, 1954] came in (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay--
Story_ID: 505793
Speaker 1: Could you tell us, what sights and sounds and smells remind you of growing up [in Tulsa, Oklahoma]?
Speaker 2: I do like the rain in the springtime; there's something about the smell of that.  The smell of Thanksgiving is always a reminder of a home that's very wholesome.  The pines from the Christmas trees remind me of that.  And then of course, on special days--the birthdays.  And then of course, don't forget the sweet potato pies.  Because those women could cook pies that were so good you'd have to take off your shoes and wiggle your toes in order to enjoy them.  So, we actually had all of those sounds and the smells which were good.  And then there was just the smell of fruit, you know, the harvest in the fall.  Because everyone had something growing--apple trees, there were peaches, there were pears.  So, all of that was there.  And then with the doors open in the summertime, almost everyone had a piano or some kind of instrument.  So you had that going and the smell of things--the chirping of the birds, everything.  We were not bored, as many children are today.  There was no such thing as boredom.  Because if they even thought you were bored, they'd ask you, "Why? What are you doing? Why aren't you using your mind?"  There was usually something that you had to do.
Story_ID: 505794
Speaker 1: --When you were growing up, did you have chores that you had to do around the house?
Speaker 2: Did we have chores?  You're very kind to call them that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, we had chores.  We had activities.  As in washing dishes, one would wash and one would dry.  Before you left, there were no toys left out.  Before you went to bed those things were put away.  Beds were made before you went to school.  The mothers didn't do that, they were not the maids.  And the reason why they did that, they felt that you needed to understand how this work was done.  You may not be able to hire someone to do that for you, so you needed to know how to do that for yourself.  Plus, it was wholesome and creative.  They also made, in those days the boys did quite a bit of the work, as they made the girls do.  But now today's mothers, they raise their girls but love their boys to death.  They love the boys so much that my boy can play ball.  You will make my boys' bed.  They raise the girls, because they taught them how to become a woman.  And that's why so many times you'll see that now it takes a woman almost to show a girl how to become a woman, and it takes a man to show a boy how to become a man.  And it's hard to become something you seldom see because we have families are so fractured now, and 75 percent of our babies now are born to single black women.
Speaker 1: Did you attend church with your family?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What was the service like?  What were your memories of the church?
Speaker 2: The Sunday school was always the beginning.  And we were safe then, and sometimes the children would walk to Sunday school by themselves.  Sometimes the parents would go.  My mother [Beatrice Brown Reed] usually walked with us, because everyone walked.  I mean there a few cars in the area, but you didn't just move them to go a few blocks.  That was when you were going down on someone's farm or something.  And following the Sunday school, that's where you would learn how to recite and how to read your little Sunday school cards and the scriptures and so forth.  Then we would go from there to the eleven o'clock service.  And those of us who played the piano, we would learn how to play for the church in the Sunday school.  Then we would gradually move to the regular services to learn how to do that.  You sat with your parents.  They didn't have to entertain you with coloring books.  There was no such thing as children's church, you sat with the adults.  You listened to the minister, because it was broken down so that you could understand that.  You would listen to the choir.  And then when it was over, you would have your dinner with your family, but you would go back.  There was something called the Training Union, or BYPU [Baptist Young People's Union of America], The Baptist Training Union or the Methodist Training Union, whichever denomination you were in.  Following that there was the nighttime service, and that's unheard of now.  But the kids all went there, but you didn't squawk about it.  It was just--everyone did that, so it was normal.  It was the norm that this was what you did on Sundays.  On Saturdays there were movies that you would attend.  It was a ritual.  All the kids in the summertime, there were canteens on Friday nights where you would go after a certain age and you could dance, you know, with the boys and the girls.  And there were birthday parties.  It was quite normal.  In fact, we thought that if you weren't doing what we were doing, maybe you weren't the normal ones.  But we were very happy.  We didn't know that we were in poverty.  You know, where would we have known that from?  We thought that we had everything.  If the money was funny, my mother would simply give us a chicken sandwich and hold the chicken.  And so, you did not miss not having what you didn't know about.  So, it was a very pleasant childhood.

Speaker 1: Could you tell us something about the elementary school?  What was the name of the school you attended?
Speaker 2: It was Booker T. Washington Elementary School [Tulsa, Oklahoma] that I went to.  And it was self-contained classrooms, meaning that--no, it was not self-contained.  When I started to teach, there were self-contained classrooms, where you stayed with one teacher all day.  But we rotated.  We had science teachers in the elementary school; we had a music teacher; the mathematics teacher.  Those teachers were specialists in what they taught.  They only taught just one subject, instead of one teacher today having to teach everything.  How are you going to be a specialist in all those things?  It's impossible.  But it was a pleasant elementary school.  We had our native girls, we had our principal, we had our activities and as a whole, I would say that it was quite pleasant to go from kindergarten to sixth grade in that school. I looked forward to going to junior high school [George Washington Carver Middle School, Tulsa, Oklahoma] and lipstick and boys.
Story_ID: 505818
Speaker 1: We were talking about elementary school?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you went to Booker T. Washington [Elementary School, Tulsa, Oklahoma], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Could you tell us something about the teachers who were there, the ones that influenced you?  What were their names?  How did they influence you?
Speaker 2: I had some there that I really--of course, I was always partial to every music teacher that I had.  Mrs. Alice Neeley [Williams] was the music teacher in elementary school.  And she just was just marvelous.  We didn't just do 'Pop Goes the Weasel,' I mean, that was important, to do the nursery rhymes.  But then those of us that she also taught--because about that time I was one of her private piano students.  So, we were exposed, I mean, to almost all forms of music.  She would find little stories to tell us, and to play music to it.  And later I would learn that she was creating and composing her own music as she went along.  Then we had the physical ed. [education] teacher.  In fact, most of the teachers were like mothers away from home.  There may have been one or two there that we could have said that probably they rode to school on a broomstick.  They knew how to teach the subject, but I don't think they liked kids.  But what can you say?  Because at that time you may not like Miss so-and-so, but that is Mrs. so-and-so to you, and so, we were still respectful of them.  But they were a little harsh and a little strict.  Even as I look back on it, even in retrospect they still were I think a little stern.  But I think they were doing the best probably that they could at the time.  And then we had a principal who would always make announcements to us, give us a little mantra, a little quote for the day.  And at the time, we didn't always understand it.  Like, the [Booker T. Washington] High School [Tulsa, Oklahoma] principal would announce every morning to all the black students--because the school was black--that "Young people, remember that you are as good as 90 percent of the people, and better than the other ten."  And we would have to repeat that throughout the day, which we later learned was building the self-esteem.  Because we knew we lived on the other side of the tracks by that time.  But it was building the self-esteem, letting you know that you could be whatever you want to be.  And so, most of the teachers at the elementary school would start that very early on--giving us little quotations and affirmations.  They didn't even call them that.  They would just have us repeat names after them, even when we did competitive games.  They didn't want you to take it so seriously that if I won, you know, that my life is over.  And they would teach us things like, "It matters not who won or lost, but how you played the game."  These were things that we had to continue to say.  Sometimes I wonder about that when I think of this society; it does matter who wins or loses [President] George [Walker] Bush.  But they would say, "It matters not who won or lost, but how you play the game."  And this was letting us know, just try hard whether you won or you lost.  And if you had fun, then that was the important thing.  The lesson was in the competition.  The lesson was in the activity.  So, we had a lot of that going on in our school.  Then we had performances.  We had to actually--there was something in our elementary school called Little Theater.  And that's amazing that people would think of that.  And it was a class called auditorium where you didn't just read the nursery rhymes.  You didn't just read the story--you had to get up and dramatize these things.  There was a drama, and there was a stage that you went on.  And then we understood later what that was doing--teaching us how to look at people, how to project, how to perform, how to--when we would on occasions go to the other side of town.  And I had to go quite often, because we didn't sell the classical music over on my side.  So, as I got older and got into [Frederic] Chopin, and [Wolfgang Amadeus] Mozart, and [Sergei] Rachmaninoff, and that crowd, I'd have to go over to the other side.  And you would not allowed to try the music out, as the whites were.  The person selling the music would just say, "You just have to take the music," unless some white person came into the store who knew how to play it.  But we couldn't try it out then.  So, we'd have to take the music home.  And we couldn't return it, but by that time we had heard it; our music teachers had played it for us.  So, we had an opportunity to play that in the elementary school on the stage.  And that would follow through junior high school [George Washington Carver Elementary School, Washington, D.C.] and the high school.  So, in addition to the academic work that we had, they were also teaching us how to maneuver the terrain and how to live in a society that may or may not give up on racism.  They were teaching us that, without even talking about it or calling it that.  They never taught hatred, they just taught self-esteem.  And these were the types of things that you have to do.  They cautioned us at nighttime about not wandering out of the boundaries of North Tulsa [Oklahoma] and never told us why.  They just simply said, "You're not to go outside."  As you got older, you would understand that it was for your own protection.  So, those were the type of teachers that we had in the elementary school.
Story_ID: 505819
Speaker 1: We had some teachers, believe it or not, who were very prejudiced to the children.  They liked the real light-skinned black children and disdained those with dark skin.  And some of the darker skinned ones were those who perpetuated this thing.  They just did not like the children who had dark skin.  They felt that you were too close to Africa.  Because they didn't teach Africa then.  The only thing they taught is, is that is the Dark Continent, and that people that are over on the Dark Continent, you know, really are not altogether there.  And the positives that came out of Africa that they taught was Tarzan.  Can you believe that?  That was what was taught.  It was not about any mother of civilization or cradle of civilization, or Egypt.  Africa was simply off-limits.  So, the children who looked more like Africa did not get a chance to perform.  The Cinderella, Snow White, were always light-skinned children.  They made a difference quite often in school.  The junior high school [George Washington Carver Middle School, Tulsa, Oklahoma] was just awful, notorious for it.  And it carried on at high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Tulsa, Oklahoma], that if your parents happened to be lucky enough to own a business--maybe got out of the eighth grade--then you were the chosen.  If they didn't have that, then you were cast aside.  And do you know that to this day the graduates of that junior high school and high school, still remember it as vividly as though it happened yesterday.  Now, we're talking about years ago.  But they still remember that why, how can we condemn whites when the black teachers were doing this kind of thing to us?  And when--who was the first in line?  It didn't go alphabetically all the time.  The light skins were first and the dark skins were behind them.  So, then they had the children fighting among themselves, even for the dolls.  They didn't allow--if a black doll came there, they would throw that out.  The dolls had to be white dolls, even though there were black dolls made at that time.
Story_ID: 505820
Speaker 1: --What kind of a student were you?
Speaker 2: I would say a busybody, one who was actively involved in all the school activities, in the dance club, and the academic work, too.  Because in the third grade [at Booker T. Washington Elementary School, Tulsa, Oklahoma]--I was looking at an old newspaper that was printed from the school, and I won the oratorical contest back in the third grade.  Can you believe that?  I can't even remember what the speech was on.  But my mother [Beatrice Brown Reed] said, "Since you always had diarrhea of the mouth and never did shut up, it doesn't surprise me that this occurred."  But I was involved in the activities; I was not one who sat on the sideline.  I participated in whatever we had, whatever the activities were whether they were in school like extracurricular activities, I felt that it was important to do that.  And my mother was one who wanted us to do that.  I don't think she tried to live vicariously through us, but she wanted us involved in what was going on at the school, the church, and the community.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Could you tell me--when you were young, you told me what kind of student you were.  What kind of a child were you?
Speaker 2: One that had to be kind of watched and disciplined a lot.  Because it was, it was a mischievous thing.  It was not one of getting into problems.  I was curious, I was like the book 'Curious George' [H. A. Rey and Margret Rey], I always wanted to know, "Well, why is that happening?"  I would have to ask questions constantly around the clock.  "Why do we have to do this?"  She would say, "Because I said so."  And later she would tell my father [Will Reed], "Oh, my God, I wish she'd give me a break."  But I always wanted to know the why of everything.  And now in retrospect, I'm glad that I did.  Because I still question situations.  Just because someone brings me frankincense and myrrh, I don't accept it often.  I'll say, "Why are you bringing me the frankincense and myrrh?"  And, "Maybe I did not ask for this."  Or, "Is there something attached to it?" or whatever it might be.  So, I was one that was always wanting also to be with the older children, the older people.  Because I just felt that there was much maybe to learn from them, or they had experiences that I thought were sophisticated at the time--
Story_ID: 505821
Speaker 1: --When you were growing up, what were your dreams and aspirations?
Speaker 2: To get out of Tulsa [Oklahoma] quickly and to do--yes, I told you, it was a wonderful place to be away from, to be out of Tulsa.  It was kind of flatlands, Middle America, Bible Belt.  They'd zip up the sidewalks at six o'clock at night.  The crickets die of boredom there.  The major activity is watching the trees grow.  And so, I truly wanted to get out to experience other things.  Because I told you, from the railroad experience, we were able to travel out.  So, I was able to--I saw Los Angeles [California] at six years old.  I was able to see Chicago [Illinois].  I saw Albuquerque [New Mexico].  I was able to see, I saw Chicago, so I knew that there was a better way or some other things to do.  I saw black people in those cities doing things that I didn't, I never saw in Tulsa.  So, I felt that if they could do them there--Tulsa's changed, you can do a lot of it there, now.  But at the time I wanted to see what was going there, and how they got those jobs, and what was their preparation.  They had gone through the same schools that I had gone through.  But I was able to see that there was another part of life.  And I wanted to experience that and to taste that, and to savor that, and to see what it was like.  I go back home occasionally to visit.  Because I go back there sometimes to give lectures and speeches, to participate in seminars and things.  Because it has changed tremendously, it is a fine place now.  But it wasn't then.
Speaker 1: Okay, I see.  What did you want to be when you grew up?
Speaker 2: Believe it or not, I didn't really give it really a serious thought.  I just thought naturally it would be something in music, just move into that.  Until--I majored, my undergraduate degree [at Langston University, Langston, Oklahoma] was in music.  And I was still playing.  And then I went on to get the master's degree [at Roosevelt University's School of Music, later Roosevelt University Chicago College of Performing Arts, Chicago, Illinois] in music.  But then I was starting to sample other things.  I was beginning to see what people were doing in politics.  I was seeing the sociology of life--what people did, you know, what the caste and class system and finally what the psychologists were doing who were studying other things.  So I found that you could play the piano, you could be in music, and do other things, too.  You didn't just have to do one thing.  Then I also started to see something else at the conservatory--there were not that many black pianists on the circuit, and usually one at a time.  Like when Leontyne Price was singing, you know, she was usually one.  And then [Jessye] Norman came.  It was usually about one at a time.  There were not several colored sopranos and divas out there.  There wasn't several concert pianists at one time who were black.  And I started to see what those options would be.  But I knew that I wanted to be something.  I didn't just want to just sit at home; didn't just want to be the average [HistoryMaker] Julia Reed [Hare], or Julia Hare, when I married.  There were other things that I felt were very important in life to do.  And I have had no regrets whatsoever (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 505822
Speaker 1: So, you finished [Booker T. Washington] Elementary School [Tulsa, Oklahoma].  Was it a junior high school you went to?
Speaker 2: Yes, I went--and that Carver Junior High School [sic, George Washington Carver Middle School, Tulsa, Oklahoma].  The schools were all named for black people.  Booker T. Washington, as you know, the history of him.  George Washington Carver, who actually, I'm told came to Carver when the school was named, came to Tulsa [Oklahoma].  Actually, he wasn't allowed to stay in a hotel, a great scientist like that.  So some black people put him up in their homes, and they were pleased that they could do that, because they could sit and talk with him.  And then the high school was Booker T. Washington High School [Tulsa, Oklahoma].  Later they would add another elementary school, which was Ralph [J.] Bunche [Elementary School, Tulsa, Oklahoma] at the time.  They added that one, and that was about it.  Now, there are other high schools that you can go to there.  But those were the high school and the junior high schools that--Dunbar [Grade School, Tulsa, Oklahoma] was one of the elementary schools.  We had two elementary schools, Dunbar and Booker T. Washington Elementary School.  Carver Junior High School, and then Booker T. Washington High School.  And they were fine performing high schools.  They don't need to apologize for the people they turned out.  You know, [HistoryMaker] John Hope Franklin came from those schools.  Cornel West grew up there, but left kind of early in life.  But when you think of some of the persons--I just can't name them all now--there were some very outstanding people that came out of there and made grand contributions to our society.  And every once in a while, they'll have a roundup and bring us all back to Tulsa.  So, it's a good feeling to know that coming out of that kind of situation--you know, the segregation and all, it paid off for us.  Sometimes it's none better than those who came out of an integrated situation.
Speaker 1: Okay.  When you were in school, were there any teachers that influenced you?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  The music teachers first and foremost of the junior high school, the high school, and the elementary school.  They were just wonderful.  Operline Bradley [ph.] in the junior high school, Clarence Fields in the high school, and Alice Neeley [Williams] in the elementary school.  There was another teacher in the high school, but I will save her for another seminar, another discussion.  But those really, absolutely were the great influences that I had.  And then I just had some teachers that were just humane, that I just truly loved.  We had a principal that unfortunately died about three months into my high school days, E.W. Woods.  That was the one who always said, "You are as good as 90 percent of the people, and better than the other ten percent."  There was the elementary school principal, J.T. Braxton [ph.], that we loved.  There was a physical ed [education] teacher, Urselle Pearson [ph.], now, she's Urselle Pearson Bates [ph.] that just loved all the children and would warm you up and just, she knew that nurturing was a little bit more than just giving the work.  She made sure that you were just warm internally.  She was always a warm, fuzzy, feeling to sit in her classroom for the thirty minutes that we--the hour or so, whatever that we spent.  We had a social studies teacher that was just such a dramatist.  I mean, she was just given histrionics, and she was just a drama queen.  But it was good for us, because when she would teach the Declaration of Independence, I mean she was Thomas Jefferson.  She would show us the quill with the pen and go on.  So, we actually were learning from her doing that.  So, we had some that were just, just marvelous people to be with.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How did you spend your extracurricular time?
Speaker 2: Playing the piano, playing in the neighborhood.  Because we could play ball on the streets, jumping and playing ball.  We would spend time sometimes at the local library, because we had some real small ones in our community.  They weren't massive or huge, but they were big enough for us.  Because the librarian would read stories while we all sat, you know, in a circle like that.  In the summertime, they had camps for us.  They had stay-at-home camps, and we also had camps where we could go away, right around Tulsa.  But the stay-at-home camps meant that you'd go there during the day and you would learn skills or whatever you do in the summertime--how to swim.  But you would spend the night at your house.  So, we would do a lot of things like that.  Some of the children would draw and paint.  I was never artistic in that sense, to do that kind of thing.  But it was that.  And then you would play jacks, Chinese checkers, things that children today would absolutely be bored to disaster.  But it helped us to be creative.  We would listen to things on the radio.  Because we could not see the pictures, it made you a very creative person, because you had to think.  When you were listening to 'Let's Pretend,' you really had to pretend.  When you were listening to things like 'The Green Hornet' or whatever was on, you really had to imagine what was going on.  So, that was honing our imagination skills in a way that perhaps we didn't know then, but later we would see that.
Story_ID: 505823
Speaker 1: When did you--get the feeling, or when did you think about maybe going on to college [Langston University, Langston, Oklahoma]?
Speaker 2: When my sister went on to college.  Well, she was the first one of our family that went to college.  Later the others would go.  But the one that I was very close to, that I grew up with, went to college.  Because a lady on our street came up and said, told my mother [Beatrice Brown Reed], "Mrs. Reed, there is a black college here in the State [of Oklahoma].  And I am certain that Peggy [Lula Mae Reed Holloway] would love that."  I went out there one year, and I just said I'm going to tell everybody about the experience.  Well, then I went there for their homecoming once.  And when I saw these young black adults, black faculty members--and they called them Miss instead of by their first names--and all the activities that were going on, I said, "I must go there."  I knew then that when I got out of high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Tulsa, Oklahoma] I was going there or someplace like that.  But I really wanted to go there, because I heard the a cappella choir sing, heard the band play, and I said, "These people are professional.  They play much better than the students in the high school."  I knew then that I had to go out to that school.  And still--now I had some friends that said, "Oh, I'm not going to do that.  I'm going to get a job."  But who was the person [Robert Frost] who told us about the road less traveled?  You know, the two forks in the road?  And I took the road less traveled.  I think I've taken that my entire life.  Because most of my friends at the time said, "Well, we're going to sit home for a year and then see."  I went on.  Because I know if you stay out for a while, it's too easy to become comfortable in complacency.
Speaker 1: So, your friends in high school, do you still talk to them?
Speaker 2: Almost daily.
Speaker 1: All?
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Nathan [Hare] always kids about the fact that they really never left there.  Now, some of them, those that I was very close to that are still living, yes I do.  I talk to two of them that live here.  Just a couple of days ago--there are some in Tulsa [Oklahoma].  In fact, she's in the Oklahoma State Senate.  I talk with that one.  She became the senator from there, which--
Speaker 1: What's her name?
Speaker 2: Senator Maxine Horner, she's a U.S. Senator there.  I talk to one who's in the House of Representatives there, Sadie Zimmerman [ph.].  And Don Ross [ph.], I chat with him.  One who is the director of the Sickle Cell Program [sic, Oklahoma chapter, National Association for Sickle Cell Disease, later Sickle Cell Disease Association of America, Inc. (SCDAA)], and who brought that to Tulsa--Mable Rice, I'm in touch with her.  There's one in Las Vegas [Nevada] who was the principal and was named something of the year, Janet Love [ph.].  I'm in touch with them.  You know, we kind of, we keep up with each other.  And if there's something that I read about one of them or they read about me in a magazine or newspaper, we are in touch, you know, saying "Right on," "go for it," or whatever it might be.  If there's a television program that they like, they will call.  Or, whenever I see them.  And we visit when I go to Tulsa, or when they come out here [San Francisco, California] they come to see me.  So, no, we--that's the good thing about growing up in a self-contained little small community, and maybe going to a black school or going to a black high school.  It really becomes your extended family.  So, we still see them.
Speaker 1: How wonderful.
Story_ID: 505824
Speaker 1: So, you're going off to college [Langston University, Langston, Oklahoma]. Were you a little nervous about going?  Or were you just so excited that--
Speaker 2: I was ready to go.
Speaker 1: You were ready to go.
Speaker 2: I was absolutely ready.  I was really not nervous about it all.  I was actually ready to go there.  Some kids the second week or third week wanted to go home for the weekend.  I did not.  I stayed there until Thanksgiving, and was absolutely ready after Thanksgiving to go back.  I really did not have problems making an adjustment there at all.  It was the first time living away from home.  I was living in a residence hall.  I had to make my own decisions.  I still saw my mother's [Beatrice Brown Reed] eyes looking at me; I knew not to do anything wrong.  But I would make decisions as to things that I wanted to do.  Going to classes where you really were treated like adults.  You know, instead of high school students, they would--at the time they would call us "Miss [HistoryMaker Julia] Reed [Hare]" or whatever your name might have been.  They gave you assignments, and you could come to class or you didn't have to come.  You just knew there were certain consequences.  So, you were really developing and growing up.  And then some weekends you could go home with another friend, with permission from your parents and all.  So, it was a growing process.  I was getting more into my own discipline then, because I had more professional musicians teaching me then.  I knew then that I had to play and learn for grades.  You're working on recitals that are at a college level.  So, I really enjoyed it.  In fact, the day I graduated when I was on my way back to Tulsa [Oklahoma] with my parents , I said, "Oh, I really hate this is over."  My mother said, "Well, I don't.  I'm tired of paying the tuition."  But I really hated to leave.  I mean, I loved it that much.  But I thought it was a wonderful experience.  But no, I never did look back and regret for a moment that I went there.  I never missed being at home.  I was always ready when the vacations were over to go back.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were you a scholarship student?  Did you have a job while you were there?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was.  Now, I was the university organist.  And I had to play for the chapel on Sunday morning.  So, that took care of most of my tuition.  My sister [Lula Mae "Peggy" Reed Holloway] played for the a capella choir.  It was a capella, but they still had an accompanist, so that helped a great deal.  Because with two people being in college at the same time, that certainly was a great help for that.  And so, we had scholarships, you know, on playing the music.  Whenever a concert artist would come through, like [HistoryMaker] Etta Moten [Barnett] came through.  Who else came through there?  Lois Toles [ph.], the professional model.  And Cortez Peters would come through and wanted to play to the music.  Well, we had to accompany these people.  So as a result, not only did the university pay us, but their agents would pay us, too.  And so we would be getting familiar with agents.  I said, "Well, now, this is grand."  I didn't know about page turners.  We were paid to have this done.  So, we were actually paid a salary, in addition to playing for the students who were not pianists.  Like, if a clarinetist or a violinist gave a recital--when you played, when you did the accompanying of that person, you were paid for that.  So, we got paid for doing something we enjoyed.  And you know how wonderful it is to get paid for doing something that you'd do if you weren't paid for it?  Well, that's what we enjoyed doing.  So, it was a great experience.
Speaker 1: Did you join any organizations or sororities?
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm a Delta.  I joined the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority.  The ladies on campus said, "Oh, why?  Your sister's an AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority]."  I said, "Well, we were always individuals.  My mother never said that we had to be the same thing."  But I joined the Deltas.  I was in Phi Delta Kappa, I think that was the name of it.  Because I'm not active in those things now.  I was with that.  The university women's association--I was in several campus activities.  Because I found and I learned that at a college the more activities you're involved in, the more you're invited, or you're more in a participatory thing, and you like to be in the campus leadership roles and all of those.  And so, by being involved with those activities, I think it sort of helps you even in your academic endeavors.  These people become study groups, and they take vacations, they take trips, they go to conferences.  They go to national meetings.  And so, I was a joiner at the time, but my emphasis mostly was on my music.
Speaker 1: Sounds like you had a wonderful experience.
Story_ID: 505825
Speaker 1: After you finished Langston [University, Langston, Oklahoma], what did you do then?
Speaker 2: Believe it or not, one of the music teachers there, a very good one, got sick all of a sudden.  And I was on my way to graduate school.  But the chair of the music department said, "Could you just come for just this one year and teach these students?"  And I said, "I just left them."  I knew most of them by their first names.  I used to go around with these students.  I said, "And you want me to come?"  I said, "Well, maybe."  Now, I didn't know how I felt about doing that.  I said, "Where am I going to live?  In a dormitory with those same students that I just left, and that I'm teaching?"  I said, "I don't know about that."  Anyway, they had a place for me to stay, with some other faculty members.  But I went back that year, and it really wasn't as difficult as I thought.  It was strange because they didn't know what to call me.  They didn't know whether to call me [HistoryMaker] Julia [Reed Hare] or Miss Reed.  Well, the department took care of that.  They said, "That's Miss Reed."  But that was kind of awkward at first.  But I did teach there for that year.  And then when they wanted to extend the time, I said, "No.  Because if I stay here, I have learned that when it becomes another year, then three years; then five years.  And then before you know it, it's retirement and you get your gold watch, and you're too old for anyone to ask you what time it is."  So, I said, "It's time for me to go."  And I left and went to graduate school [Roosevelt University's School of music, later Roosevelt University Chicago College of Performing Arts] in Chicago [Illinois].  Because they said, "While you're here, you could go to Oklahoma State [University, Stillwater, Oklahoma]."  Because, let me see, the University of Oklahoma [Norman, Oklahoma], you could only take subjects there that were not offered at Langston University.  So I guess you could have gone there for music because they didn't have a master's degree in music at Langston.  So, I went on to Chicago.  And that was quite an experience, because that was a true music college at Roosevelt.  Nephews and descendants of [Sergei] Rachmaninoff, these were the people who were teaching.  Most of them were European professors, but very, very good, and I enjoyed the experience with them.  And I never will forget, that's when the perfect pitch really pulled me through.  Because what they would do, they would say that this is a composition exam, and if you do not pass this exam, you are out of this music school, which most of them did flunk.  But what they would do, they would put maybe the soprano line on the board.  Then they would say, "Now, let's play through it to see if you know that."  Well, with the perfect pitch, I could remember what they had played for the alto and the tenor and the bass, and would finish that.  So, that would get you through.  And those experiences were certainly a great help.  So, I enjoyed that school, too.  I don't think I've been to one that I didn't really enjoy.
Speaker 1: When did you start Roosevelt?  When did you attend, the years?
Speaker 2: Oh, God.
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: No, I have to think of when that was.
Speaker 1: I have it written down.  I'm sorry, we'll go on, we'll come back.
Speaker 2: I hope you did get on to when I--to--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to Roosevelt.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it was open.  I mean, it was integrated.  All of those Brown v. Board [of Education of Topeka, 1954] things had long been past.
Speaker 1: In the '60s [1960s], that's right.
Speaker 2: Was that in the '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 1: It was in the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: It was in the '60s [1960s]--
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: --when I was there.  And it was on State Street. Michigan Avenue was the front part, I think.  But I haven't been in there so long, and I don't know whether they have moved it around.  It may still be there.  I hear from them, you know, when they ask for contributions from the alumni association.  But I haven't been back.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was--how was moving from Tulsa [Oklahoma] and Langston [Oklahoma], which was a small town, the city that the university was in, the small town to Chicago?
Speaker 2: Well, to a certain extent, it was an adjustment.  I think the weather was the worst adjustment for me.  Because the cold weather--which we referred to as the hawk then.  And the hawk visits other places, but lives in Chicago.  So, it took me a while to sort of get used to that.  But really it wasn't difficult because I was teaching, in addition, you know, in the elementary school, while I was going to the graduate school at the same time.  And so, I had, I met a lot of friends.  And then there was a person who grew up with me in Tulsa who was also at Roosevelt as a music major.  So, that, that helped.  Plus, she lived in my building on Drexel [Avenue].  So, it was not as though I was among a lot of strangers.  And then a lot of people from Oklahoma used to go to Chicago.  They went there for better jobs.  The employment was better.  A lot of people who graduated from college, instead of returning to Tulsa, they were teaching there.  You really could have had a Tulsa alumni association, you know, that was present.  So, it really wasn't that difficult.  And then my mother [Beatrice Brown Reed] had brothers there; there was that family there.  Nathan's [HistoryMaker Nathan Hare] family, he had relatives and friends there.  There were friends from my church that lived there.  It may have been different had I gone to New York [New York], because I knew no one there, or going to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] But Chicago--and it was also not that far.  You know, you could fly or drive to Tulsa in no time from Chicago.  It really was not that far away.  And then Chicago had its South Side, which was like the North Side of Tulsa's black.  And I didn't have that much of a difficulty.  And then I--I can't remember the church.  But I played for a couple of churches there, while I was there.  So I really was busy, I wasn't sitting around waiting.  And then my mother would come and visit and father [Will Reed].  And I would go there and visit.

Speaker 1: So, Dr. [HistoryMaker Julia Reed] Hare, you were saying that while you were in graduate school [at Roosevelt University's School of Music, later Roosevelt University Chicago College of Performing Arts, Chicago, Illinois], you were a teacher.  Could you tell us something about your teaching career--what grade you taught, where you taught?
Speaker 2: I taught the early primary grades--kindergarten, first and second.  And there was a reason for that, more than one reason.  I was in graduate school doing music.  I was able to play the piano a lot in those lower grades, because you know, singing is a lot of it.  So, I was also keeping my fingers nimble and the whole bit.  I enjoyed working with the children at that age, because they were so eager to learn.  I did not want to, and still do not want to deal with high school students.  I just do not want to--the child-rearing thing of people who are sixteen and seventeen.  I like to get in on the ground floor to sort of infiltrate the mind, or to get it going when it is open, you know, just open to learning, not when it has been kind of closed off a bit, opinions are already made.  So by doing that, I had an opportunity even during the nap time when the kindergarten children were napping, to sort of review my notes because I knew I was going to school that night.  Not that they were ever neglected; I would actually use them as a part of it.  Like, papers that you're writing in the music literature class, I was able to review that with them.  Because when the children were sleeping, rather than playing 'Pop Goes the Weasel' for them, quite often I would be playing [Ludwig van] Beethoven's 'Moonlight Sonata' for them, you know, on the piano.  And they were understanding what I was playing, because I would tell them what I was playing.  And they were able to hum this music.  Sometimes it would be 'Ava Maria,' before the religious theme went out of the schools.  Then I would play, I would tell them this is 'I'm Always Chasing Rainbows,' but instead I was playing [Frederic] Chopin's 'Fantaisie-Impromptu,' which that is a part of that.  But later it became known as the 'I'm Always Chasing Rainbows.'  All of those type things I would play for them--the 'Air on the G String' and I would say, "I hear someone knocking."  'The Woodpecker,' and 'Beethoven's Fifth [Piano Concerto No. 5].'  So, I was able to tie in my studies with the teaching and training of them.  So, no one was being shortchanged on that.  But I was being able to give them a kind of cultural background that, from the school where I was located, I know a lot of that was not in the homes.  And so, I would hear from the kids many years later over this same situation--that now the music that you were playing then, that was it.  But then when they were up and on their feet, then I would play the music for the childhood, what they needed to hear then.  So, I did that until I was out of the school.  And the day that I graduated is when I left the schools there in Chicago [Illinois].  And it was quite a distance.  Because if you know the city, I was on the South Side but I taught on the West Side, the far, far, West Side.  So, it was hours getting over there, which meant I meant also took classes on Saturday, because I wanted to get the graduate work over as soon as possible.  Then there were recitals, you know, that you were practicing.  So, I was busy there in Chicago.  I really didn't have that much time to really become bored with the city.
Story_ID: 505847
Speaker 1: 'Kay.  After you finished Roosevelt [University's School of Music, later Roosevelt University Chicago College of Performing Arts, Chicago, Illinois], what did you do then?
Speaker 2: We moved to Washington, D.C.  Now, I didn't bother too much with the elementary school children then.  It's terrible.  I was the supervisor--first of all, I was an enrichment teacher.  And as an enrichment teacher, you do go around and see what's happening.  But you're teaching the teachers in the elementary school some things to do with the children in terms of the humanities and the language arts.  You're teaching them.  So, I was actually on the faculty of the District of Columbia Teachers College [later University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.] as the enrichment teacher, and in charge of the college controlled laboratory schools.  Now, we had under the college controlled laboratory schools two schools that we called demonstration schools--that was LaSalle [Laboratory School, Washington, D.C.] and Truesdale [School, Washington, D.C.].  Because new teachers coming to the district must go to those schools to observe how to teach.  Those were college controlled schools.  All of the teachers who taught there were actually on the faculty of the District of Columbia Teachers College.  Because that was the purpose of it, and those were the laboratory schools.  The children didn't have to just be geniuses to be there.  They didn't, they really didn't have to live in the neighborhood.  But sometimes they were recommended by other schools.  The teachers had to be recommended to go there.  There were some strenuous tests that they had to take.  But they had to be able to teach any child that went to the school.  It was an extended kind of family that even the parents around there were allowed to come and sit in.  You had to do demonstrations at that school at least every week, so the teachers were constantly on their toes.  Then I would have to go out to find out what they were doing in order to make sure that things were going correctly, and what was going on there.  So, then we would also demonstrate at the other universities in Washington, D.C. like American [University, Washington, D.C.] and George Washington [University, Washington, D.C.].  And while I was there, I was really honored to be named Educator of the Year by the [U.S.] Junior Chamber of Commerce, the World Book Encyclopedia, and American University, for the work that was done, you know, with the demonstration schools.  And there was no one--because again, the music was tied into that, but so were the academics and the work that was going on.  So, that was great fun, and I got a great learning experience just from working there.  And I will never forget the teaching experience in Washington, D.C., and also the learning experience.  Because I worked with some of the very best educators that you probably would find in the country.  Because even though they could have been every day on the college campus, they also chose to be down working with student teachers, teaching them how this is done.  It is now I think called University of the District of Columbia [Washington, D.C.].  But at that time it was across the street from Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  And almost every teacher went there, and they all had to have master's degrees or doctorate degrees.  And most of them at that time went to New York University [NYU, New York, New York] or to George Washington University where we gave demonstrations there also.
Speaker 1: How long were you there at the school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Around six years.  But then when I left there and I came here [San Francisco, California], then I kind of left the education for a while.  I just have never, I guess I have to admire people who can work at something for twenty-five or thirty-five years.  But I'm afraid that my boredom would come in, and I wouldn't be at my very best.  So when I came here, flying on the airplane, I knew that I was finished with the work at that time in the elementary schools.  I would go to them and do some things that needed to be done, but not on a day-to-day basis--
Story_ID: 505848
Speaker 1: So, I became the first director of education for the Oakland Museum [of California, Oakland, California], because the museum was opening.  Now, the museum was not exactly alien to me, because as the language arts and the college--and the supervisor at the college and--the University of the District of Columbia [Washington, D.C.], which was at the time the District of Columbia Teachers College [Washington, D.C.]--I had to do a lot of work with the curators of the Smithsonian [Institution, Washington, D.C.].  Because we tried to bring the museum to the kids, in addition to taking the kids to the museum.  So, when Oakland--it was opening, this was a new museum that had never opened, hadn't had it there.  And so, I was speaking at something at San Francisco State [College, later San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California], talking about the Smithsonian.  I had no idea that some curators were there and asked would I come there and work with them on getting other people--blacks, ethnic minorities, women, whoever, involved in the museum.  And I said, "I'd be delighted to do that."  But I said, "I must develop something that you probably haven't had before, and that was a museum on wheels because a lot of people are not coming here.  You're going to have to take the museum out to them."  So, we had what we call traveling exhibitions that went out.  And we had, we got all of this from the changing exhibition galleries.  Because we had permanent galleries that you have to come there to see that, because that's borrowed from museums all over the world.  But we would take the museums out to underprivileged areas.  We would take them to middle class areas, any group of people that we felt would not on their own come there.  We had things that they could handle and touch in the museum.  It was not a hands-off, you know, you can pick this up, it's not going to break.  Before we knew it, then they were coming to the museum.  Because I would always dangle the carrot, "There's more of that over there at the museum if you come over to us."  So, we would arrange for them to come there when I felt--then I developed a board and brought in people--these were adults, blacks who had never had the opportunity to sit on a board of a museum.  Because you know, that's kind of a playground of the rich and the affluent.  And so we brought them in and established a board for them.  Well, they were surprised.  Well by doing this, then we brought in black artists who had never had an opportunity to display their work in a museum.  We brought in black scientists, because we also had a specialty there in the natural sciences.  And the other specialty was California history.  We were able to bring in black historians that never thought that they would have an opportunity to be in a museum.  So, when the national museum meetings took place--and Thomas Hoving at that time was the director of the Smithsonian [sic, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, New York]. And we would meet at all of the fancy, great museums, Santa Barbara [Museum of Art, Santa Barbara, California], you know, there are good ones all over the country.  These people that we brought into the museum were able to come with me, down, and meet other curators.  So, now they are dispersed over the country.
Story_ID: 505849
Speaker 1: Well, when I thought that work [at the Oakland Museum of California, Oakland, California] was finished, I then was the public relations director for the National Committee for Discrimination in Housing [sic, National Committee Against Discrimination in Housing, Inc., NCDH], which is housed in New York [New York] but had a San Francisco [California] group out here, this was the West Coast area.  Being the public relations director for them, to get people out of some of these projects and to get them out of these projects that are eight and ten floors high where girls are raped and can be pushed down elevators, we were the ones that decided that HUD [United States Department of Housing and Urban Development] would have to--if you're going to build a project now, it cannot be over two or three floors high.  We did that in order to get them out, and to show them how they could come out of that and not be embarrassed by living in public housing.  Because you know, [President] George [Walker] Bush lives in public housing.  And so we told them that there's no reason why you should feel, you know, ashamed to have to do this.  Senators, elected officials, live in public housing.  So, after that program was finished, we got a lot of them out of there and got them on their feet and got them jobs.  And now they're self-contained, doing what they wanted to do.  I was having a press conference to announce that.  And that's when the news director asked me would I come and do some talk shows at KSFO [KSFO-AM, San Francisco, California].  At that time Gene Autry owned the station.  I said, "I don't know about collecting this news.  Because if you're going to assign me only to do the crime, to do the six o'clock news at night, I'm not sure that I'm interested in that.  But if I'm going to come there and do the regular things..."  So, we started off first with the talk shows.  And there were a lot of people that had issues that they wanted to get on there, on the radio, and wanted to come in, and didn't know how to do that.  So I decided to take, again, KSFO out to the community and bring them in and show them how you get your news on there.  In fact, I wrote a book how to get a job in radio to pass it out.  And I had a community meeting, and I said, "Now you read this carefully.  We'll have some seminars on Saturday, and we can get you on as DJs [disc jockeys], talk show hosts, news people or whatever you want to be.  But you have to be ready to do that, and have the background to do that.  You can't just come there and say that I want to do this.  You have to have some preparation for that."  Well, after doing that for a while, then--the major talk show station here is KGO [KGO-AM, San Francisco, California].  Then I went over there.  Now that is really stepping in high cotton, and you're swimming with sharks over there. Because what would happen is that people can sit at home, that's another level.  The demographics, they're very affluent, they're very educated.  But sometimes they'll sit at home and look up something in a dictionary and call you, you know, and ask you what these things are.  But you soon learn the game, and say, "You know, I'm going to get back to you.  But I think you're smart enough to answer that.  Do you want to share the answer?"  You know how you have to do with them.  And especially if you work overnight, because all the insomniacs and the drunks are on the phone.  So, you learn eventually how to handle that.  And so, there were many highlights of doing that.  Because you get a chance to interview the senators, which I had an opportunity to do, and then to ask them questions that I thought that people would want to ask.  And I put myself in their place.  They couldn't come there selling something.  They couldn't come--I would just simply ask, "What do you plan to do about such and such a thing?"  You know, to just ask: "Do I have to answer that?"  I said "Well, no, you don't have to answer it, but then you'll have to leave."  Because that was the attitude that was taken at KGO.  We did not take any prisoners in doing these type of things.
Story_ID: 505850
Speaker 1: So, I was able to bring in a lot of people that wouldn't have gotten there [on KSFO-AM, San Francisco, California] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What were some of the interviews you recall?  Some of them--
Speaker 1: Some of the interviews that I've--?
Speaker 2: --the ones that you--really stick out in your mind.
Speaker 1: Let me see--
Speaker 2: Anybody in particular?
Speaker 1: Always the mayors.  When [HistoryMaker] Willie [L.] Brown, the former mayor, was the speaker for the California State Legislature he would come often and it would stand out in my mind, because I would have to hold him--see, politicians speak out of five sides of the mouth.  And I told him, "Tonight, can we have one side?"  Forked tongues, "Can we use a spoon tonight?"  Because you'll ask them something and they'll go all around, "I'm very glad you asked me that question.  And I'm going to get back to it."  "Now!"  Because they don't want to come back to the question.  The entertainers that would come--because our station at one time was located in the Fairmont [San Francisco] hotel [San Francisco, California].  And it was my job to interview everyone who came to the Venetian Room.  Well, that would include, who came through there?  Tina Turner, [Frank] Sinatra came through, [HistoryMaker] Nancy Wilson--I mean anyone who played that room.  That was the part of the deal of the hotel, to come down.  And some of them were, I'm telling you, prima donnas, divas, that you wanted to just say get out, you know, the whole thing.  They would come and they would say, "Just a minute, can I interrupt you for a moment to be sure that the ten gallons of milk are put in my suite for my bath when I get up there?"  Things of that nature.  And then I would just ask them, "Can we now have the interview?"  And we'd get on with it.  And then the politicians sometimes you would talk with them on the phone.  Most of the U.S. Senators--Dianne Feinstein, all of them came, Barbara Boxer.  Because that's a station that is about 50 watts, it goes after six or eight o'clock at night all over this region; it isn't just here.  The calls would come from Canada, Mexico, and it goes all over.  So it was actually a learning experience for me, because you have to read, just like you would in graduate school.  Because it's a very, very sophisticated audience that you really just can't play games with them.  And if you know, it's better to say, "I don't have the answer."  And then you have to have both sides coming on trying to balance them, especially during an electoral period.
Speaker 2: You mentioned that when you went out, that you had a little booklet about how to get on the radio?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Do you know if any, if any of your audience or anybody that you talked to actually did get into radio?
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, there were several that got on.  And in fact, the station paid for the publication of it.  Gene Autry, when he owned the station, was very, very gracious, and very generous, you know, to everyone who worked for Golden West Broadcasters, the station here, and those in Los Angeles [California].  But yes, I sent them out even to students.  There were some of the teachers that I taught broadcasting with at the City College of San Francisco [San Francisco, California] who still use that.  And some of them have worked at stations until they got tired and decided that they would teach.  Some of the people at CBS used it and got jobs from that.  ABC, KNBR [KNBR-AM, San Francisco, California], what was the other one?  KMEL [KMEL-FM, San Francisco, California], there were a number of stations that used it, how to do that.  And I said, "You can just transfer this same information over to television.  There is only one difference.  When you're working on radio, always remember in your mind that you're talking one on one, that the person in the garage is listening to you; the person in the car, that you're speaking only to them; the person in the kitchen, you're speaking only to them.  On the television the difference is that, pretend that you're speaking to a stadium.  You know, it's a whole group of people that are watching.  But the radio is very intimate and very personal, and one-on-one.  And when you come in for your interview, keep that in mind and you should have no difficulty."
Story_ID: 505851
Speaker 1: What did you do after you got through radio?
Speaker 2: Went fulltime, kind of into several things.  Into the psychology--I travel a lot on the road doing motivational (unclear) lectures.  Like, tomorrow I'm on my way to Tampa [Florida] to the University of South Florida [Tampa, Florida].  And then from there, your place, Ohio.  And then I have to go down to North Carolina.  So, it's out a lot, mostly to universities helping students to decide where they're going.  Also, to civic and social organizations talking about black history and the black family, and what is causing that.  We're looking at the high incarceration rate.  I've often told them that it's a shame that we have about a million black men in jail waiting for justice, and all of the black women in church waiting for Jesus.  And that there ought to be a way that we have to begin to look at this and see how we bring this together, and why are we in a society that is determined to build more prisons than educational institutions.  So, those are some of the topics that we get into.  And why are so many successful black women out here trying to find black men?  And that's why I did the book, 'How to Find and Keep a BMW: Black Man Working' [Julia Hare].  Because is one of the stressful things that they come in to see us about, that they are not able to find them on that level.  Well, the university students are very interested in that, too, especially black female students who are at historically white colleges.  There's a great shortage there, because there are--the few black fellows there are usually there on scholarships and don't always date the black girls.  And so, there's a problem that they have there.  So, for that--and then when you talk to corporations, it's mostly about diversity in the workforce and how to make most people feel comfortable about it.  And so, some weeks I'm here, but quite often I'm not.
Story_ID: 505852
Speaker 1: 'Kay.  You have a second advanced degree, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Could you tell us where you got it, and what field it is (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I got it in Santa Ana, California.  You know Santa Ana, where the winds blow, at California Coast University [Santa Ana, California].  I got that in educational psychology and social psychology, which would give me a chance to deal with a lot of people on a social scale.  Because a lot of people do not come in for clinical work.  Because they were coming if their back was hurting or if their knee was hurting, but not if their emotions or their mind is hurting.  They don't want to come in one on one, but they will come with groups.  So, I mostly work with groups, if there are eight or ten that seemingly are having some of the same problems in the labor force, in domestic situations, we will work together as a group to feel better.  Some of them are into substance abuse, mostly from prescription drugs.  But it still is an abusive situation whatever it might be; it's still drug abuse.  I work within the schools here [San Francisco, California] and in other places.  An organization will put it on.  For instance a sorority or fraternity may want to have something of that nature.  Or even the church will do that.  Because some churches now are becoming more reality based, and working with people who're having problems in life, in addition to fulfilling their spiritual mission.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you do this all over the country?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How long are the workshops?
Speaker 2: It all depends on what the hosts want.  Sometimes if it's a lecture, that's about forty, forty-five minutes.  A workshop may be about two hours.  Like the one that's going to take place in Toledo [Ohio], the Urban Minority Alcohol and Drug Abuse [sic, Urban Minority Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Outreach Programs of Ohio], whatever that is, now that goes on all day.  But I will do a seminar for about two hours, and someone else will do one for two hours on that kind of program.  And that's funded by the State of Ohio.  That's been going on for a long time, and they absolutely do an excellent job.  Indiana is another state that I go to that does the Indiana Commission on the [Social] Status of Black Males.  A lot of cities have established that believe it--a lot of states, funded by the states, really looking at that.  Because I think that a study just came out of the University of Wisconsin [Madison, Wisconsin] that a white male who has a felony conviction can get a job much faster than a black male who's never been to prison.  And so, now it has made even the President [George Walker Bush] look at that.  They're beginning to look at that very carefully to find out what's happening.  Where does this happen?  And we're beginning to find out that the psychological drop-outs begins in elementary school, and they physically drop out by the time they're in junior high school and high school.  So, those are the things that we do.  So, we'll go back to what Carter G. Woodson in history told us that we needed to.  Booker T. Washington told us that "Build your own institutions.  Begin to teach your own.  Drop your buckets where you are."  And those are some of the things that we have not done.  We have turned over childrearing to the state.  By meaning the state--the prisons, the juvenile justice systems--to punitive situations like the courts instead of the family.  Because you remember, they took discipline away from the families and the public schools.
Story_ID: 505853
Speaker 1: You are executive director of the--
Speaker 2: The Black Think Tank [San Francisco, California].
Speaker 1: The Black Think Tank.  Could you describe some of the activities, and its purpose and goal?
Speaker 2: Yes.  We [Hare and HistoryMaker Nathan Hare] established that in 1979.  The Black Think Tank looks at problems that have happened in the past, and we work on what is going on in the present and see how this is going to impact the future.  We looked upon, now that discipline has been taken away from parents and has been taken away from the schools--then what corrective measures can we take for our own children when you're more likely to live in the seamier areas of town and you cannot discipline your children, but yet the cops can when they're sixteen.  We've seen that happen.  What changes should we be looking at, you know, to counteract and to go against those types of practice and patterns of practices?  Why is it that so many black males are unable to get work, even those that are qualified?  I'm not saying those who want to hold up the street corner.  And we're finding that other populations of males can do that.  We're looking at that very carefully.  And we disseminate literature; we write pamphlets and articles.  We don't just send things out to them without answers.  We send out answers about the black agenda, which we recently did.  We sent that to every pastor.  Because we said that the only institution that black people own now are the churches.  And you're going to have to start preaching two Sundays of the month, and teaching the other two.  The Sundays that you teach is when you invite the black professionals in.  You invite the black police officers in to tell us, what do you do when you're stopped?  What do you do when you're stopped for driving while black?  These will--this is an intervention program to keep them from going to prison.  You invite the schoolteachers in to teach them how to take tests.  And while you're teaching them how to take tests, the parents should teach them how to do that, too, because children learn when they do that.  You invite the M.D.'s in to do some prostate screening, because most black people don't have any insurance.  And do the breast cancer screening.  One pastor said, "You mean we would have prostate screening in our church?"  I said, "I didn't tell you to do this in the sanctuary, but you ought to have it in the church, breast cancer screening, too.  Because you have funerals in this church for the same--from people who die from these deaths."  When are you going to invite the foster care people in?  The black people that are over that program say, "Why would you rather take a child out of a black family, from the black grandmother, and put them in a white suburban community where reunification is impossible?"  We're going to invite the black attorneys in and tell them, "Brother Pastor, you've got to teach them how to expunge the records of a child before they're eighteen, so that will not follow them into their adult lives."  So, that's what The Black Think Tank does.  We study the problems, then we send out answers.

Speaker 1: One of the programs you do is, you do a rite of passage.  You wrote a book about (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, we [Hare and HistoryMaker Nathan Hare] did, 'Bringing the Black Boy to Manhood: The Passage [Nathan Hare and Julia Hare].'  We did that, we were the catalyst for that movement.  And we sent that out in '70s [1970s] to show how many black boys do not know when they have become men.  You remember in slavery they just called you--what did they call you?  Instead of calling you Mr., there was--Uncle they would call you.  They called them Uncle.  A black girl goes through a menstrual period which validates that you've now become a woman.  A black male really doesn't have anything.  There are not too many role, male role models around in the family or in the neighborhood.  Years ago, they were there.  The teacher lived across the street from the prostitute.  The preacher was on the street.  All groups were there.  So, you got a chance to pattern and see who was living there--that's not the case now.  So, when you live in a predominantly matriarchal community and mostly what you see black women, where do you learn the patterns of what a man becomes?  And so, in this book we describe to them how black men with families and living with their sons--how you must always include a single woman's black sons in your child's activities also.  Take them out and show them what it means to become a man and how to do that, and answer their questions.  Take them to the prisons to visit, to see is this what you want for your home?  The same thing that you would do with your sons.  We have taught them in 'Bringing the Black Boy to Manhood' how each child should adopt a senior citizen, so that you learn how to treat elderly people, and you will learn how to do errands for them.  How you learn how to pattern yourselves on how to treat the females, and so some of the domestic violence will come down.  These are the things that they have to do.  Teach them how to work.  Every black boy should have a chore and errand in that community.  Not only in the home, but in the community.  You must have that.  Other than that, when you do learn the work ethic?  This is what you do.  Teach the parents how to be selective of your child's friends.  So, someone will say, "So you're choosing your child's friends?"  "Yes, I am.  I'd rather choose the friends, because I'm not going to be able to choose the cellmate.  So, I will be involved in this now."  That's what that book was about, 'Bringing the Black Boy to Manhood: The Passage.'  And then after he's completed his program, you don't do that in a month, it's about two years.  After that program is completed then you have a big ceremony, like you'd have a bar mitzvah.  Like, you would have a confirmation.  You validate: you have now become a man.  The community comes out and celebrates this.  That's going on now over the country.
Story_ID: 505855
Speaker 1: That's wonderful.  You've also written about black male/female relationships.
Speaker 2: Yes, we've [Hare and HistoryMaker Nathan Hare] done a lot.  We did the 'Crisis in Black Sexual Politics' [Nathan Hare and Julia Hare] because we really had had that.  There was black rage and misplaced rage between black males and black females.  They were blaming each other for each other's problems instead of looking at the whole political spectrum of what's happening out there.  Why is it that when I come home, as a black female, that I have to argue that you're not making as much as the white male that I work with.  We've got to find out what the factors are behind that.  Then when he comes home and will ask her certain things, "Well, why is it that the house is not already done," or whatever it might be, where someone else may have a maid.  "I'm working just like you."  "Why do you make more?"  "Why do you make less?"  All of these problems come in, this rage that is misplaced.  Sometimes if one gets laid off, if you don't have exactly what I'm making, I'm not going to do that.  We have a lot of successful black females right now who have said that, "If I'm not with a professional black male, I don't want you at all."  Some professional black males have a briefcase with nothing in it but a peanut butter sandwich.  We're trying to tell them, you'd better look at some of the blue-collar males. Because you've got to look, are they good men?  Do they treat you right?  Are they spiritual?  I mean, did they resolve all conflicts with their mothers?  Did they treat their mothers and sisters right?  Because if they didn't, chances are they'll resolve it with you.  You've got to look at the person rather than the degrees.  These are the type of things that we tried to get over in the 'Crisis in Black Sexual Politics.'  And we use some other authors in there who are quite good.
Speaker 1: So, do you, you do workshops around the country?
Speaker 2: Yes, on those topics, too.
Speaker 1: To help people to communicate with each other?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Because until black males and black females communicate, the family will further deteriorate.  Because the family begins with black males and black females, and strong male/female relationships will bring up strong children.  Because males and females who are not disciplined, how do you bring up disciplined children?
Story_ID: 505864
Speaker 1: So, I was wondering, could you tell me--you do a lot of work with black families.  How did you become interested in studying about the black family and working in that area?
Speaker 2: Truly with [HistoryMaker] Nathan [Hare] and through Nathan, my husband.
Speaker 1: Nathan.
Speaker 2: Because he has always had that interest, long before it was fashionable, to study what was going on.  This is why when he graduated from the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], and many universities were after him, historically white ones.  He said, "No, I must go to Howard University [Washington, D.C.]."  He wanted to go there he said "Because I think that that would be a place that I'd like to begin this study, and to continue my interest in what's going on."  And so, we looked at that, you know, and I got involved along with him when he came to San Francisco State [College, later San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California], also as the first black studies director.  Well, we started to look carefully at the black family and what was happening.  We saw the decay and the deterioration right in our faces.  While some people would say "Is it getting stronger?"  We'd say, "No, it's getting weaker."  But a lot of our black scholars didn't want to admit that, because you know, when you admit there's a problem then you have to do something to correct it.  And but now they're all saying, "Well, whatever happened to it?"  You know, what went wrong with the family?"  But the thing that probably did happen with it is that we did not--if we had done some of the things that brought us safely through and remembered the bridges that brought us safely across--but instead of doing that we went in different directions.  We started to lose our boys, we started to lose our girls.  We started to just divorce over nothing. It used to be a time you could argue and you could have discussions or disagreements, but it didn't mean that you had to completely tear down the family.  We allowed then the government also--when it took the discipline away and then told the teachers that they could not discipline our children that was absolutely a mistake.  After the schools integrated, the black family, or the black parents, sort of lost their control over what they had of their black children, and then they had to take on the values of the society that they were integrating into.  And maybe their discipline was a little bit different from black families, because they weren't as likely to be arrested by the cops as quickly as black people were.  So, we started to study where the family was coming.  We started to notice that the divorce rate was just absolutely increasing.  It's really astronomical now.  We started to see that the children were just running away and getting sort of disengaged from their parents.  There was not that closeness, that cohesiveness, family outings, doing things together.  We found out that the dropout rates, not only in college, they weren't even going as much, but in the public schools were absolutely failing.  They were--the suspension rates were on the rise among black children, not to mention the psychological and the physical dropout rates.  So, we said we need to study this.  And our first book on that I think was 'The Endangered Black Family' ['The Endangered Black Family: Coping With the Unisexualization and Extinction of the Black Race,' Nathan Hare and Julia Hare].  We said we need to look at why this is endangered, and explain to people what is going on.  We looked at when the abortion situation came out.  They didn't really mean that for black people.  They meant sterilization for blacks and abortions for whites.  And we said that this is nothing but population control, because we could see that blacks were steadily multiplying--all of the people of color all over the world.  And so, the dominant culture said we have to do something to curtail this, because whites were not reproducing themselves anywhere in the world.  Because the more educated people are, chances are the birthrate is down a little bit lower.  And so we said we have to alert our people to Planned Parenthood and things of this nature.  We don't really need them to plan our parenthood, it was always planned.  When I was growing up the kids were usually two to four years apart.  They knew how to space them in what they were doing, long before birth control pills.  So we said we have to begin to study this ourselves, and make sure that when things are brought to us, let's examine it before we grab it.  Just like the public schools now.  Well, now they've got a charter, and the privates.  And now, Leave No Child Behind [sic. No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, later Every Student Succeeds Act].  We, before we know it--you know, we have government schools; that's what they are now.  They're simply called public schools, but they really will eventually become that.  And this is to militarize our schools.  This is exactly what's going to happen.  Military academies are what they're going to become, training them for war.  So, we're saying we have to either monitor and watch what's happening in our own public schools, or begin to start our own teaching academies.  It's going to be one of the two.  You have to--sometimes animals in the animal kingdom, they educate their own.  Elephants do not allow tigers to come over and educate their children, nor to determine how it's going to be done.  They don't even use the milk from other animals.  And so, we have to--these children are our future.  And I think that if black people do not save them, who will?
Story_ID: 505865
Speaker 1: You mentioned that black people should save their children.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What kind of a school would you like to see developed for black students, or students in general?
Speaker 2: I would like to see that when black students are in a black school, I would like to see that the black parents, rather than an alien school board--that chances are they don't even live in the city.  Sometimes they live in the suburbs like a lot of them do here, and then they make decisions that should be universal for the entire city.  You don't need a universal curriculum.  First, where is the school located?  And then we'll find out, what are the needs of the school?  Suppose the school is in an area like in San Francisco [California], the Tenderloin, where they can't step out without stepping on needles--the drug-dealers, the pimps, the abductions and the whole thing.  But then your curriculum may be a little bit something else, instead of your geography studying what's going on in Europe, your geography ought to be studying what's going on in the Tenderloin.  They all do not have the same--I have a friend that was teaching in a school that was really low-income.  The parents did not have checkbooks to write--a checking account to write to the companies to pay the bills.  She taught the fifth and sixth-graders how to teach the mothers how to write money orders.  Do you know the school board wanted to fire her?  She was teaching a necessity.  She couldn't write the checks that she didn't have, and they didn't want her to accept the cash, so she taught the children how to teach their mothers how to write money orders.  I'm saying they need to teach what they need for today.  What are the skills they need to get them through this day for tomorrow and further on into the future?  That's what they need.  They don't have the casualty of teaching what is the queen having for breakfast?  That may be fine in some schools, but these children haven't had it themselves.  So, I think there should be community control of schools, just like I think that there should be community controlled police officers.  They should be made to live in the communities where they are, to get friendly with the children and friendly with their parents.  Then they will not quickly take them down to these other places.  I think a school should be community controlled, the principal should live in that community.  If you're going to be on the school board making decisions for them, you should live there.  And there's really nothing wrong with the teachers living there.  Now, I realize you don't have to be in a place to be of it.  Just like some people are black by birth, and some by consciousness.  And sometimes we confuse them.  But I think that a person ought to have an intuitive feeling about what it takes to bring the children to where I am.  If I'm a teacher and I got here, what happened, how did I get here?  Just impart those same things instead of something that's coming out of a textbook from people who have never studied that population that you are teaching. Now, this is not to say that black people cannot teach whites, or whites cannot teach blacks.  But I think you have to absolutely be soulfully tied in to those that you are going to train.  What are their needs?  Their needs should be placed first.  And then you can bring them to Shakespeare.  I'm not saying Ebonics has to be in here, but if you can bring them to Shakespeare--but you must start where they are.  A lot of the young teachers do not understand they have to start there. "But my curriculum said I have to start here."  "No, you can't start there."  When Johnny is ready, the teacher will appear.  And you must start where Johnny is or where Susie is, or whatever the name might be.  And sometimes we don't do that.  We suspend these children when they don't do things.  If you're going to suspend them, suspend them to the nearest church where the senior citizens meet, so they can continue to teach them.  Do you know, one pastor told me "Dr. [HistoryMaker Julia Reed] Hare, do you realize that you can't suspend them to my church?  I do have a senior citizens' program, but those seniors only went to the eighth grade."  I said, "Then they should be able to tutor up to the eighth grade, wherever they went."   I said "But when you suspend them to the streets, you're sending them to the state pen [penitentiary]."  I said, "Then they put 'em in special ed [education] classes.  Special ed classes--a lot of teachers who have not been taught to teach black children will put them in there because they can't discipline them.  Special ed classes are nothing but holding cells until they're old enough to go to prison.  And in those special ed classes they're now allowed to give our children Ritalin and Prozac, the same thing the American Psychiatric Association [APA] allows them to give them that.  Those are forerunners to drugs, which is going to send them to the state prison.  Now, you're going to tell me we don't need to revamp these public schools, especially those in the inner cities?
Story_ID: 505866
Speaker 1: You have so many interests; you started out in music and you've come around with education and--become a psychologist.  How is--does music still play a part in your life?
Speaker 2: If I weren't stopped sometimes by my husband [HistoryMaker Nathan Hare], the piano would play all night long.  And when that finishes--maybe music and the whole thing.  Yes, I just cannot imagine a day without that.  You know, it's just, what is the song about Paris [France]?  "I never knew my heart could sing."  I just don't think that it would, if I did not have music as a vital part of it.  And that is all types.  It doesn't have to be classical music.  I certainly like the old standards, the rhythm and blues [R&B] all of it is music.  Because each speaks a message in its own way.  And so, it is not especially--even the hip-hop music, I'm not a fan of the language, you know, the lyrics and that kind of thing; I really am not.  I realize that it moves people maybe to something else.  But wouldn't it be wonderful if you could take the beat and the rhythm of the hip-hop music and put the words, 'Fun with Dick and Jane' [William S. Gray and Zerna Sharp] or whatever they're teaching now, to that.  Because anyone who can memorize all those words that they have to hip-hop music ought to be able to read.  And yet, they'll say those same people cannot read.  But I think that music is still a universal language.  I found that it still brings people together when nothing else does.  I just cannot imagine a day without it.  Every day it is a part of my life.
Speaker 1: Do you play any other instruments besides the piano?
Speaker 2: Not as well as the piano.  I play the organ equally as well.  But I have studied the oboe and the violin.  And then someone told me, "You know, oboe players die earlier."  That was years ago.  My mother [Beatrice Brown Reed] said, "Don't listen to that."  So, I, those instruments I play.  I have, what is this other thing, a viola.  You know, I play those.  But the piano and the organ are the major two.  But the piano is my primary instrument.
Speaker 1: Do you play with a group, or with others, or by yourself primarily?
Speaker 2: Both.  I play sometimes by myself.  I, sometimes if it is like standards, you're at a little snack, cocktail, or something, I may sit in with the group.  But then the classical music, I will either play by myself or with another person.  If we're playing, like someone is going to play the primo and someone is playing the secondo, then the two of us will play together, either on one grand piano or on two.  It depends--or if it's in a church, one is doing the organ and one is doing the piano.
Story_ID: 505867
Speaker 1: Do you have any other interests, other hobbies or interests that you--things that you're interested in, you like to do to relax?
Speaker 2: That I relax with?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Well, I read a lot.  I do enjoy doing that.  And not just about--black literature is alright and black history is alright.  But I am certainly by far not limited to that.  I certainly like to read what other people are doing, including the rich and the famous.  I like to know what others in poverty are doing and having to tolerate; what other governments are doing.  I am very interested in that; not just in ours, but others.  And I am especially, when blacks hear this they'll say, "Oh, [HistoryMaker] Julia [Reed hare]."  I'm especially interested in people like [Ralph Waldo] Emerson and [Henry David] Thoreau and Walt Whitman.  And I think that's the romanticism that comes from the music.  But almost every morning, they must be read, you know, just to find out exactly what they'll do.  I like cynicism and the political clout of Thoreau when Emerson visited him in jail, and Emerson had the nerve to say, "What are you doing in jail?"  Thoreau said, "Why aren't you in here?"  So, that speaks everything that I ever need to know about people like that.  "I fought and I'm here over a cause and you're asking me why am I in here."  That's the political elements that do like of the early writers--Oscar Wilde, Edgar Allen Poe with his gloominess, I love that.
Speaker 1: Wonderful.  Is there anything else that you'd like to add that I didn't ask?
Speaker 2: No.  I just am very appreciative that The HistoryMakers have taken on this project.  Because I do think that this is something that should be passed on.  Because anytime if you don't pass on your history, and people don't know what it is about, then they're doomed to repeat their mistakes.  But I think that people ought to know that we've also had many successes, and there's room for many, many more.
Story_ID: 505868
Speaker 1: If you, if it was possible--had you ever thought about--there's still time in your life, you're still a very young woman.  Any other career--a change of the career, something else you would like to do?
Speaker 2: To write a romance novel.  And isn't this terrible?  They have said "This is coming from you, [HistoryMaker] Julia [Reed Hare]."  But it would be one that deals with reality, not one that is cast away over in Old England.  But I mean about the romance of the spirit and of the heart, and how people can get along. And how even if you're living--I have a lot of underprivileged girls who will say, who are economically underprivileged, that "I really wish that I had class."  I said let me tell you, "You can have class in the ghetto and trash in the White House [Washington, D.C.]."  And so we, that comes from within you, not where you live.  You may live in a certain place, but you're not there permanently, you're not there. You may be there physically.  So, that kind of thing, to let them know that where you are today does not have to be where you are tomorrow.  And don't let your mind settle there.  So, a lot of people think that where I am today, if I think--it's like being poor and broke, if you begin to say, "If I'm broke," that's a condition of the moment, but if you say, "I'm poor," then you have placed yourself in a place of permanency.  Well, that's the kind of thing that I'm interested in doing now.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  You started, when you were younger you started out in church.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Have you developed spiritually?  Or, are you still religious?  Do you still go to church now?  Is it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I have a--
Speaker 1: --does it play a role in your life?
Speaker 2: Spiritually plays more of a role in my life than organized religion.  I do prefer the spirituality than the evangelist, and the whole bit of the talking in tongues and all.  I have a problem with those who are into that.  But I think that a spiritual person is not only that way on Sunday mornings at eleven o'clock.  I think the spiritual person lives that every day.  And some of the persons that I know that to me are extremely, extremely spiritual, somehow are not totally in the organized church.  And some who are in the organized church, I sometimes question about the spirituality.  And then there are those who are in both.  I will go, but I don't think it's a ritual that I have to be there every Sunday morning.  Because I think it's said where two or more are gathered--and I would like the churches not to meet every Sunday morning, but occasionally to take the congregation out to the streets, out to the parks, out to where people meet.  You can still take up the offering, if that's important.  But we must learn to tithe with our time as well as of our finances.  So, spiritually, yes, I have grown.
Story_ID: 505869
Speaker 1: What are your hopes and concerns for the African American community in the future?
Speaker 2: I hope that we will begin to learn something.  I think there is a statement that I often say that, "If you want something you've never had before, you must do something you've never done before."  And I think that that's one of things that we have not done.  We just keep repeating some of the same things and reinventing the wheel.  We cannot do that.  If it's freedom you want, if it's liberation, if it's the best in education you want, then look back to see, well, what have we done?  And if that didn't work then let's move on to something else that might work.  I think that is very critical that we have to do that, but some people are afraid to set goals.  And I wish that blacks would say what are we going to be doing six months from now?  A year from now?  Two months from now?  Because I found that people who don't set goals, people who don't have any goals, seldom miss their target.  And so, if you aim at nothing, you'll get nothing.  But I find that a lot of 'em are also afraid.  I've talked to groups that I've said, "What are your goals for the next six months?"  "Oh, I don't do that.  I'm afraid I may not make my goals.  I may do something wrong."  I said, "The tragedy in life is not from not meeting your goals.  But the tragedy in life comes from having no goals to achieve."  And so, they said "Well, I suppose I stumble?  You know, people are going to talk about me if I don't make it.  And they'll know I was out there running for office.  I didn't do what I needed to do."  Well, I think that if you fall, you should try to fall on your back.  Because if you can look up, you can get up.  Because you've got to try it.  But some people are just not risk-takers.  We need to be risk-takers as blacks were in the '60s [1960s], as they were in the '40s [1940s], as they were when they were in the Underground Railroad.  You have to be a risk-taker.  But you can't be safe and stand by and watch the circus.  Get out there and join the circus, and be a part of the trapeze artists and fly with them.  I think if that happens we would certainly see some great improvements--not asking others to do; give reparations to ourselves.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 505870
Speaker 1: When you look back at your life, what stands out the most?  What are you the proudest of?
Speaker 2: What am I the proudest of when I stand back?  That in spite of a lot of situations in the society, I am successful and have overcome those things.  I am very proud of the fact that I had the courage to take the road less traveled.  Most people will stay with one career, and you asked me about that.  I've been in education, media, psychology, museums.  I've been in various areas of life which helps to make the holistic whole, when you have sampled all of those things.  I have lived in different cities.   Some people say, "Were you afraid to move from one place to the other?"  No, I have not always been successful.  Some things I've attempted, and it didn't work.  But I just learned such a great lesson from those things that didn't work, because I look back and say I didn't need that anyway.  So, I'm happy that I'm self-contained.  Not to sound arrogant, but I really am not too concerned about the opinions of others.  You know, as you go through that period, a lot of people are.  I don't need their validation.  You must learn to validate yourself, and that's the important thing.  Because if you're not pleased and happy with who you are, it doesn't matter how others see you.  The important thing is how you see yourself.  And you know when you need to improve; you know when there are things that you can do.  And you know humility is the greatest thing that you can say.  Because if most of us, thank goodness, most people are not what they think they are.  You know, look at the problems that we have.  But if you can keep that humility about you, but always reaching out trying to help others...  So, I'm proud of the fact of all the positions that I've held, the jobs, that I have had--those that I liked or didn't like as well as the others.  But in the long run, I found out that they strengthened those I did have, and I'm very pleased with that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What values--what are the values that you've learned from your parents [Will Reed and Beatrice Brown Reed] and have carried into your life?  What are the values that you think are important to have?
Speaker 2: They told us always, no matter where you go in life, no matter how successful, no matter how big, or whatever it is, to always remember the bridge that brought you safely across.  There are too many of us, and too many people, period.  I have seen them.  I don't care if they're in the U.S. Senate.  Somehow they become successful and they develop amnesia.  "I got here all by myself.  I pulled myself up by the bootstraps."  And I knew some of them when they didn't own any boots.  They'll say things like that.  "I don't owe anything to the community."  They forget to whom much is given, much is expected.  Now, I do respect my parents for letting us know, "Always remember from whence you came.  Always remember those people who are at the bottom of the ladder when you ran up there, because they're going to be right there when you come right back down with those splinters.  And never say that you got anything all by yourself.  There was always someone to help you.  You don't even fly from here to New York.  The pilots, the airplanes, the air controllers--everybody took you there, plus faith also took you there."  And they just restored values in us.  If you don't have it do not steal it, do not take it from others.  Do not envy them.  Do not be jealous of them.  If it's for you, you'll have it.  If you're supposed to win the lottery, you'll win it.  So, you just take your time.  And if you don't get it ever, then maybe it was not for you to have.
Story_ID: 505871
Speaker 1: How do you want to be remembered?  What would you like people to say about you?
Speaker 2: I know some things I wouldn't like for someone to say that I think they might say.  (Laughter) I would like them to say, "She did the best she could with what she had."  I would hope that.  And for the headstone, if I were having something like that to read "I have no regrets," which I have not.  I think that I did what I had to do at the time the best I could at that time.  Sometimes when you look back, you'll say "Well, maybe I should have done"--no, but that was the best you could do at that time, and the best that you knew how to do.  And I would like for them to say that, "She was a good person, that she was caring, giving, understanding, had an ear for listening to people."  Because I will do that, they don't have to come here to talk to me.  I can see them on the street if they're having problems.  And if they would remember those things--I would go and play for them whenever I can.  People often ask me, "Would you play for the funeral?  We don't have"--I do not charge them to play for anything, weddings, none of that.  The gift was given to me, it must be shared with them.  I do not ever charge to play, or to do any of those things.  It just does not make sense.
