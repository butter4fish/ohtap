Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe. I'm interviewer for the HistoryMakers. Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Sir, could please state your name and spell it for us, please.
Speaker 2: Useni Eugene Perkins.  Useni is spelled U-S-E-N-I, Eugene E-U-G-E-N-E, Perkins P-E-R-K-I-N-S.
Speaker 1: Useni, I know that a name you picked up later on in life.
Speaker 2: Useni is my African name.  It means tells me.  It's taken from the African country of Malawi, which has its own language.  Malawi being in East Africa, near Tanzania, one of the smallest countries in Africa.
Speaker 1: Now, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Date of birth, September 13, 1932.  I was born in Chicago, Illinois at the--I think it was the Illinois Children's Hospital, which was across the street from Cook County Hospital.
Speaker 1: Okay, and tell us what is today's date.
Speaker 2: Today's date is March the 10th, 2003.
Speaker 1: Right.  And, where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We are at Chicago State University, where I work and we're in a conference room, a small conference room.
Speaker 1: Okay and sir, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm a social worker by profession but I'm also-if, if you could say a writer by non-profession, if there's such a nomenclature, I have a dual career.
Story_ID: 77894
Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five "People" magazine-ish type questions we always ask.  And, they just require a short answer.  The first one is what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Right now, it's salmon.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Black.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: I would say fall.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Africa.
Speaker 1: And, sir, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Not that I can think of, really.
Story_ID: 77895
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright, well, let me ask you about your family background.  How far back can you trace your family and do you know what your family was doing in the 19th Century--say during the time of slavery or before Reconstruction?
Speaker 2: I'm sort of embarrassed to respond to this question because I know very little about my family lineage.  I have made a feeble effort to trace my father's side with not much success.  My mother's side--I can trace it maybe one generation, her grand--her mother.  My mother was born in Shreveport, Louisiana.  She died early, at forty-nine.  My father was born--we believe in Marche, Arkansas, which is near Little Rock, Arkansas.  He died six months after my mother transpired.  He died at fifty-one.  We believe my father came to Chicago [Illinois].   when he was about six or seven years old.  To our knowledge, he had no brothers.  I think his parents died very early because he was reared by Aunt Doris Padrone here in Chicago.  So my father never talked about his early days but he didn't have any brothers, sisters or cousins that we were ever familiar with.  So that's why I know very little about his lineage.  And, my mother, Eva--Gillon was her maiden name had three brothers.  All are deceased.  She was the oldest of four.
Story_ID: 77896
Speaker 1: Now can you give us her name again and spell is for us--and--.
Speaker 2: Eva, E-V-A.  Gillon or Gillon, G-I-L-L-O-N.  Her maiden name.
Speaker 1: G-I-L-L-O-N?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, what's her date of birth?
Speaker 2: She died in 1951.  I just don't have a--I think I wrote it down on your questionnaire.
Speaker 1: Yes, so she was--you said she was forty-nine?
Speaker 2: Forty-nine, yes.
Speaker 1: (unclear) around 1900 I guess or thereabouts, right?  I guess (unclear).
Speaker 2: The early--yeah, well--little later than 1900.  She died in 1951.  (Simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: So, yeah.
Speaker 1: 1952?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I mean in 1902 right?--02.
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: Well, what was your mother like?  Can you tell us about her, you know, what did she do and what was she like:
Speaker 2: Well, my mother was a loving person.  Mainly a housewife but she worked many domestic jobs, especially during World War II.  She used to even work at the airport, Midway, cleaning airplanes. And, she would do day work at various locations on the north side but primarily she was a housewife.  I think before she passed away, she worked at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], she was a housemother.  She didn't have to live in the house but she was what they would call a housemother.  She was there during the day time to attend to some of the needs of some of the students.  So, that's basically--little education.  I don't believe she completed high school 'cause I think she was about seventeen or eighteen.
Speaker 1: Now, did she--had she been in Chicago [Illinois] a long time?  Did she move up to Chicago when she was a child?
Speaker 2: I don't know when she arrived in Chicago.  I do know she born in Shreveport, Louisiana.  Now when she arrived in Chicago, I really don't know.  I would assume that she probably came here in her early teens.  But that's just an assumption because the few pictures that I've had of my mother were pictures when she was a teenager.  I've never seen the picture of my mother when she was a child.  We only had a few pictures and only one picture of my grandmother, whom I cannot remember or recall having ever seen.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So how many brothers and sisters do you have?
Speaker 2: I have two brothers.  One is deceased.  The oldest brother--his name was Robert Perkins.  Robert was sixty-five or sixty-six when he died.  He was living in Memphis, Tennessee at the time.  My second brother, Toussaint, who is living today.  Toussaint is seventy-two.  Of course, I'm seventy--so my mother had the three boys.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm the youngest.
Story_ID: 77897
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now tell us about your father.  What's his full name and spell it for us and can you give us his date of birth and where he was born?
Speaker 2: Again, I can't give the date of birth.  His name was Marion and it's spelled M-A-R-I-O-N, Perkins.  No middle name and none of us had middle names.  To the best of our knowledge, he was born in Marche, as I indicated earlier, Arkansas.  He went to Wendell Phillips High School.  I don't think he graduated.  But he was an extraordinary person, self-educated, well read and very creative.
Speaker 1: He's one of the famous artists of the 1930 period, I guess--30-40s [1930-1940] here in Chicago.  Yeah, so tell us about, you know, how you got involved (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well, my father--I don't know what motivated him to take an interest in sculpturing, which he became an outstanding sculptor.  He used to take me around on the bike.  He had a newsstand at 37th and Indiana.  At that time, we were living at 36th and Wabash and he would pick up these different pieces of stone, at different locations, buildings that had been torn down.  He would go on the waterfront a lot because the 1899 Exposition left a lot of marble all along the lakefront and he would pick up these large pieces.  Some of them were fifty, sixty, seventy pounds and begin chiseling.  I guess he may have had some preliminary training.  I wasn't aware of that but my father as a sculptor--he also knew a Jewish sculptor named Sy Gordon.  There was something like an art colony located, I believe, near Cottage Grove, around 33rd street.  And, the various artists--they had small apartments and Sy Gordon, who was a sculptor, took an interest in my father.  Think Sy had observed my father sculpturing at 37th and Indiana.  We had a newsstand and, at that time, newspapers were two cents.  The "Daily" newspaper, the Sunday paper was a dime and Sy saw my father chiseling on stone and I think in a way he became--I don't know if he became his mentor, but he did have some influence on my father's early career.  My father was a laborer, worked a number of jobs, dishwashing, different restaurant jobs and eventually got a job at the post office.  But all during this time, he would sculpture.  He was a sculpture that used all facets of sculpture and by that I mean clay, wood, soap and of course stone, which today many of the sculptors, they used a blow torch.  They don't, you know, almost a welder.  So my father, in the tradition of sculptures, I think he really began with clay and also chiseling with wood and eventually stone and marble produced a number of pieces at the newsstand.  People would come and just see this man sculpturing.
Speaker 1: Where was the newsstand?
Speaker 2: At 37th and Indiana.  So that was about two blocks from where we lived 'cause we lived at that time at 36th and Wabash.
Speaker 1: So he had actually seen sculptor while he was at the stand?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, during the day selling papers.  He would always be doing some work and we'd just leave it there overnight, no one would bother with--and, of course, I would work at the newsstand early in the morning, before I went to school.  My mother worked at the newsstand, my other brothers--that was a source of income--small income because, basically we were on relief.  They didn't call it welfare in those days.  They called it relief.  So we were on relief which means that we were getting public assistance, especially as it related to food and some clothing.
Story_ID: 77898
Speaker 1: Now, you were born in '32 [1932], that's right in the [Great] Depression.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: The Great Depression so you grew up basically in a bad environment--it wasn't a lot, I guess, to, you know, in the community, I guess to return the jobs and opportunities and stuff.
Speaker 2: Well, you did have--you had the Royal--what was it--not Coca Cola, Royal, Royal.
Speaker 1: Royal Crown?
Speaker 2: Royal Crown was at 39th and Wabash and you also had Golden Rod Ice Cream Company and I would assume that they employed people living in the community.  But at that time, you have to understand that, that most blacks that were working were doing domestic work or else working in factories.  There were a few, at that time, located in the community.  You had Wonder Bread, company on 55th Street.  You had Silver Bread, I believe it was called.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I heard of that.
Speaker 2: And it was on the South Side.  And you had a couple of dairys.  So there were a few jobs that were in the community, in proximity.  But, of course, during the '30s [1930s] you had high unemployment and it would--it probably impacted the black community even greater.
Story_ID: 77899
Speaker 1: I want you to reflect back and try to give us a sense of what it was like to grow up in your neighborhood and, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells growing up?
Speaker 2: I had a wonderful childhood.  The Cranford Building where we lived--we stayed on the fourth floor.  I think we had four rooms but my brothers and I we all stayed in the same room and slept in the same bed but we went to Raymond Elementary School.  That's the first school I attended and Raymond was right across the street from the Cranford Building.  Now the Cranford Building--you had Joneses and Bradleys and they were all related to us.  I mean the Cranford Building was really occupied by relatives so the janitor, Uncle Bradley, was the janitor and it seemed like as relatives would come from the south, they would come to the Cranford Building.  The always had a place to stay.  So you had the Bradleys, the Joneses and, of course, we were the Perkins--and, other relatives living in that building.  So that's why I say we had a lot of fun because I grew up with my cousins.  Went to school with my cousins, grade school and high school.  We used to play, we used to have a lot of fun.  Now we didn't live too far from 35th street.  Thirty-fifth Street at that time was a very active artery, a very active street.  You had the Lewis Theater.  The State Street Theater was right around the corner, at 35th.  And, then you had the Grand Terrace Ballroom.  Of course, I was too young to go in the Grand Terrace Ballroom but we would go around there and look because you would get all these celebrities going to the Grand Terrace, which was at 35th and King Drive.  And, they had that red carpeting so we knew it was something special.  Then you had other restaurants, up and down 35th Street.  Thirty-fifth Street was very active.  And, we would spend some times on State Street.  I wasn't aware that the Mecca Building was at 33rd and State, I believe, but afterwards, as I grew older, I learned something about the Mecca Building.  But I did have an opportunity to go in the Mecca Building.  It was not as--it was beginning to deteriorate a little bit when I observed it.  At one time, it was just a beautiful place where the gardens were inside.
Speaker 1: A residential building?
Speaker 2: It was residential but they had--inside it was--they had these beautiful gardens, the Mecca Building.  And that was on State Street.  Then you had all of these vendors selling fruit, vegetables, chickens, if you wanted a chicken, live chickens.  They would--you just identify the chicken that you wanted and they would take the chicken and wring the chicken's neck and then they had this hot water.  They would scald the chicken with this hot water and cut off some, some of the, you know, (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Pull the feathers?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the feathers off.  So you could buy--and the chicken would be--even without the head, the chicken would be moving around and everything like that.  'Cause I think we used to get chickens just about once or twice a week.  All of this was taking place on State Street, literally from 35th Street probably to 47th Street.  All kinds of stores, little small stores.  But it was like a market place out on the street 'cause you actually sell vegetables and the fruit, they used to have these large carts and they used to just bring 'em and just set them along the sidewalk.  So, I know I would go shopping quite a bit with my parents, with my mother.  And, then you have a lot of these rummage sales, lot of stores selling used clothing.  They call 'em rummage sales.  That's where we bought of our clothes.  I can't recall having any new clothes when I was a kid but we didn't have to.  We had clothes because we could buy 'em at these different stores all up and down State Street.  Right in front of the Crawford Building was a large vacant lot so that was where we'd just go out and play, play ball and run around, just have a good time.  Really had a very enjoyable childhood in that area.
Story_ID: 77900
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell me about school now.  What school, grade school did you go to?
Speaker 2: Well, the first school was Raymond [Elementary School], which was right across the street from where we lived.  Now, we eventually moved to Ida B. Wells [Homes].  And, we were just so happy because Ida B. Wells was--you thought you were in heaven compared to the Cranford Building.  Although the Cranford Building was not a slum building but it was nothing like having a new house.  When we moved to Ida B. Wells, we had a--it was like a townhouse.  Beautiful. We had a refrigerator.  Prior to that we had a ice box, where we had to buy ice 'bout every other day to preserve the food.  So now we had a refrigerator, nice kitchen, backyard and a small front yard.  We still only had two bedrooms so the three of us shared one bedroom, my two brothers and myself.  Of course, my parents had the other.  So when we moved to Ida B. Wells and our address was 600 East 39th Street, right on the corner of Vincennes and 39th.  It's still there but it won't be there too long because they are tearing down just about all of those townhouses in Ida B. Wells,  But, where we lived, is still standing.  Then I went to Doolittle [Elementary School].  I transferred when we moved to Ida B. Wells, I think I was about eight or nine years old.  Then I went to Doolittle which was at 35th, 35th and Vernon, I would think, in that area.  I only went there for a year and I was glad 'cause it seemed like I got into a lot of fights in that area.
Speaker 1: Why didn't you transfer over?
Speaker 2: Well, for some reason, they just transferred us to Oakland, which was a 41st and Cottage Grove.  It's there now but St. Elizabeth--not St. Elizabeth--Holy Angels has purchased that building.  But I graduated from Oakland.  I spent a year at Doolittle and, for some reason, I guess, for boundaries or something and where I was living, Oakland was closer anyway.  It was only about three blocks.
Speaker 1: So when the family moved to Ida B. Wells, you started going to Doolittle?
Speaker 2: For a year.
Speaker 1: For a year.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And then they transferred us to Oakland.  Both schools were approximately the same distance but, for some reason, they moved us to Oakland.  So I was only in Doolittle for a year.  And I graduated from Oakland.
Story_ID: 77901
Speaker 1: Now tell me about grade school.  What were you like in grade school?  What kind of a little guy were you and what did you like to do?  Do you like school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I enjoyed school.  School--I wouldn't want to miss school.  We had a lot of fun.  I didn't enjoy Doolittle [Elementary School] too much 'cause it seem like--used to always get into difficulty with some of the other guys.   But you had these gangs, even in Chicago [Illinois] at that time around Doolittle and they didn't care for kids that were in the housing project.  That's what we would call it.  It was Ida B. Wells--it was--but we call it housing project and they were envious, I think, because they thought that 'cause we had new homes, they thought that we were better and--but we were poor as anyone.  We were living in these new places so (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Now that's a complete reversal of the way people look at it now.  But at one time, I know I've heard other people say this that at one time, it was a privilege to be selected to (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: --the projects.
Speaker 2: They would come to your previous place where you were living to interview you and look at your house.  You had to be inspected.  When we were living at 36th and Wabash, they would come and interview the families.  I remember when they were coming to interview my parents.  My mother said look, be very quiet.  Be very courteous and we just cleaned up everything.  We wanted everything to look, you know, really good because you had to be approved.  And, I forgot to mention when I was living at 36th and Wabash, we weren't too far from the Wabash YMCA which was at 38th and Wabash, which was the oldest first black, I believe, YMCA, in the country.  And, so we would go there quite a bit, at the YMCA.  So when we went but at Ida B. Wells, we were poor, we were still on relief but yeah, it seemed like people that didn't live in Ida B. Wells envied us.  But because they thought that we thought we were better than them and maybe they resented the fact that we were living in these nice houses and all around us was nothing but blight.  That was a very poor neighborhood, from 35th to 41st, from Cottage Grove to King Drive.  That was a lot of blight in that area and here you had this beautiful housing development, almost at the center.  But the real problem was Madden Park and that became the place where we would all congregate.  I almost literally grew up in Madden Park when I was a kid.  After school, that's the first place I would go 'cause that's where you could play baseball.  You could play football.  You could just have fun.  The Park District also had classes, art classes, drama classes.  That's where the gym was so you just had a lot of fun.  And it seem like that those of us living in Ida B. Wells began to over-populate the program and the kids that used to go there felt that they were being left out so it was some conflict between kids that didn't live in Ida B. Wells and those of us that did live in Ida B. Wells.  And we had some scrimmages but nothing very serious.  The other building--it's a historic building is the Hampton Building, which was at 39th and Langley.  And the Hampton Building had this open elevator.  They had mezzanine where you had several stores, beauty shops and a couple other stores on the mezzanine level and people lived there.  That was a beautiful building, the Hampton Building.  And the trolley, the streetcars, we call them streetcars, they had--what they call the barn--was at 37th, 36th and Langley.  So we used to always hop on the trolley and ride it free and jump off and have a good time doing that.  But my childhood was wonderful, I had a lot of fun.  Ida B. Wells had a lot of activities.  I was involved in a lot of things.
Story_ID: 77902
Speaker 1: All the sites that you've mentioned, most of those are knocked down there, aren't they?  I mean most of the--the Hampton Building and the other buildings.
Speaker 2: Yes, the Hampton Building, the Cranford Building, where I was born, that's the first building, right at 35th and Wabash.  And, the Hampton Building was torn down and the Ida B. Wells [Homes] has been destroyed.  Of course, the high rises have already been demolished.
Speaker 1: Those were Darrow Homes, right?  Clarence Darrow Homes.
Speaker 2: They called 'em the Clarence Darrow but it was really just an extension of Ida B. Wells.
Speaker 1: Everybody called them the Ida B. Wells anyway.  (unclear)
Speaker 2: Extension.  And, like I indicated earlier, the townhouse that I was living in, I guess it would be demolished within a month or two months.  Every time I pass that area, I take a look at the building.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (unclear)
Speaker 1: Okay, we're rolling again.  But, so, you said that Oscar Brown, Sr. was a (interrupted).
Speaker 2: To the best of my knowledge, he was the manager of Ida B. Wells.
Speaker 1: Oscar Brown, Sr.?
Speaker 2: Oscar Brown, Sr.  Yes.
Story_ID: 77903
Speaker 1: Alright, well, tell me about how you liked school.  Did you like school and did you do well in school?
Speaker 2: I was a good student.  I enjoyed school.  I remember several of my grade school teachers, Mrs. Graves.  She was a beautiful woman.  She lived at 45th--I would--near Prairie 'cause on weekends, I would go to her house and clean up her house.  So she wasn't too far from Oakland [Elementary School], which was at 41st and Cottage Grove, you know, just about lived in the neighborhood.  And, but Mrs. Jackson was the teacher that really inspired me.  She was very short.  We called her bulldog Jackson 'cause everyone thought she was mean.  She would pull your ear and she had a lot of racial pride and she was one of the first teachers that really began talking about African and African American history.  Was really very strong on that and race.  Would always encourage us to--to just do well.  That you have a responsibility to the race, that you need to study and prove that you are as good as anyone else.  So she was a highly--a great motivator.  And then I remember Mrs. Berry, my eighth grade teacher.  She was white but she was--she had a lot of confidence in me. And it seemed like, that she really began to encourage me in my writing.  I started writing poems when I was in about the sixth or seventh grade.  And she would encourage me.  And I think help me with composition and English.  Very supportive.  So the teachers were outstanding.  I didn't have a male teacher.  Basically, I don't remember a male teacher.  I remember Miss Dunn, Miss Gray, Miss Jackson and Mrs. Berry.  Those four teachers I remember very vividly.  It all had an impact on me.  This was in grammar school--when I start--this is when I start writing, really start writing poetry.  And I remember I wrote this, a poem to a girl that I liked.  I don't know if she liked me.  I don't think so.  The first poem that I wrote, at least one of the early poems, and I think I've always remembered it.
Speaker 1: Well, can you recite it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes, I think so.  I found that wealth is not in coin, nor dream, nor depth, nor mile, for all the treasure that I need is in your tender smile.  I've learnt that paradise is not beyond the blue but anywhere that I catch the smallest glimpse of you.  And I remember I wrote this poem and I gave it to her and she looked at me and torn it up (laughter).  So it wasn't too encouraging but I began writing--
Story_ID: 77904
Speaker 1: I used to write detective stories.  I used to read a lot when I was in grammar school.  Used to read a lot of Charles Dickens.  And I used to read a lot of Sherlock Holmes stories.  Seems like I was interested in detective stories, some of O. Henry.  I hadn't read any black authors until I went to high school.  And that's when I, of course, began reading Richard Wright's "Black Boy".  But I did get some Langston Hughes because Mrs. Jackson would expose us to Langston Hughes but in terms of books written by blacks, I think my first book was "Black Boy".  That was in high school.  But I used to read all these other books.  I used to go by the library after school.  I wouldn't go straight home some time.  The library was the--where the Center for Inner Studies is now, Abraham Lincoln Center, right at Langley and Oakwood Boulevard.  And I would stop by there just about every day and pick up a book or read a book.  Used to do a lot of reading but those are the types of books that I used to read, the detective stories and I mentioned some of the authors.
Story_ID: 77905
Speaker 1: The Lincoln Center was a very interesting place 'cause it was a lot of artists would congregate there.  Some lived there and it was very--begin to understand lately in terms of politicians, so called left-wing politics.  Now my father was very active with left-wing politics while he was a sculptor.  We never did talk about this but he became very much involved, which was not untypical of many black artists.  He was active with the Southside Art Center, which was one of the first black cultural institutions in the country.  I know Eleanor Roosevelt came there to--for its inauguration.  [HM] Margaret Burroughs participated.  My father [Marion Perkins] was involved.  Charles White, Archibald Motley, Willard Motley, Marion Motley, Richard Wright--Gwendolyn Brooks was a secretary at the time at the Southside Art Center.  And I would meet all these people that later became famous.  Some were famous at that time.  Charles White was a highly regarded artist.  Archibald Motley was a highly regarded artist.  His--Willard Motley was his cousin, I think, some relationship.  I think he had wrote this "Knock On A Door".  And I read that book.  But it wasn't about a black youth.  It was about an Italian youth, Nick Romano, who grew up on the west side of Chicago.  And he had this slogan, "live fast, die young and leave a good looking corpse".  That was his slogan, Knock On a Door but Willard Motley wrote several books.  So all of these artists and writers would convene around the Southside Art Center.  They would have classes.  My father was very active and many of them did become involved in the--I said left-wing but it was communist party.  I'm trying to think of the writer, the Reed was the writer's group was named after this communist writer named Reed.
Speaker 2: Who, John Reed?
Speaker 1: John Reed.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: He's the one that, you know, wrote "Ten Days That Shocked The World".
Speaker 1: So, they had the John Reed--my father was very active.  Never did talk politics at home.  Never did talk about his involvement, everything like that.  But he knew some of the top communist, definitely in the State of Illinois.  He knew Claude Lightfoot personally.  Claude Lightfoot and he were very close.  Claude Lightfoot lived on the west side.  We would visit Claude Lightfoot's family.  AS you know, Claude Lightfoot became the Chairman of the Illinois Communist Party.  Ishmael Flory, very eloquent speaker, scholar, was a dear friend of my father.  So, but that did not have any impact on me at the time, here I'm ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen years growing up and I didn't really know what my father was involved with but I know that he would have people by in the evenings, diverse population.  And we never did talk about his politics and my mother never did talk about it--
Story_ID: 77906
Speaker 1: It wasn't 'til later I began to understand that, that was his involvement with the Communist Party.  And even much later because we finally got his file from the government.
Speaker 2: The FBI [Federal Bureu of Investigation]?
Speaker 1: Yes, the FBI.  What do you call it?
Speaker 2: The Freedom of Information Act?
Speaker 1: Yep, yep, it's about, it's very, very, very thick and I haven't read the whole file so--because my father was condemned later.  It kept him from being drafted and it impacted me when I was in the service.  I enlisted.  I was in the [U.S.] Air Force and I was eventually went to Keesler Air Force Base, radio communications.  So you had to pass a high security check and while that was being done, it was disclosed that my father was a Communist and so for the remainder of my three years in the service, I was frozen, which means I could not get upgraded.  I could not get transferred and, in fact, I was almost court-martialed but I had a hearing and the papers were about 200 pages.  And unfortunately, I lost those documents.  And I had a white captain, Weldon Humboldt, who represented me.  Told me he didn't, definitely didn't like Communists and didn't care too much for black folks but he believed in the legal system and he would represent me properly, which he did.  And that lasted for about six months, a trial.  It wasn't a court-martial but it's what they call a hearing.  And had they found me guilty of that then maybe they would have court-martialed me because I was--
Speaker 2: What were you charged with, what they charge you with?
Speaker 1: Well, I think because in filling out my first, when you're filling out these papers when you enlist, they ask you did you have any affiliation with Communist and, you know, and I didn't--I said no.  I didn't, I didn't--and I think that when I was going to Keesler Air Force Base, I had to have a security check and that's when--then they felt that I was lying.  And, so I had attended American Youth for Democracy [AYD] meeting, which was attached to the Communist Party at the time, but a lot of--you know, I went there for fun, a lot of young people attended the AYD meetings.  I wasn't, never was a member.  My father was actually a member so that's why they froze me and I--cause I wanted to not be a pilot but a radio operator, which meant I would have got a wing.  You know, I was trained for that, I'd done well at Keesler Air Force Base but they sent me to Biggs Air Force Base in El Paso, Texas, where I just really didn't do too much.  In fact, they pampered me, played basketball, did a few things.

Speaker 1: So, when you're a kid, did you--now the Southside Art Center was a WPA [Works Progress Administration] project, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, I think so was the writer's project over at the center, over at the Abraham Lincoln Center and I read about--did you ever meet Margaret Walker and Richard Wright and (unclear).
Speaker 2: I believe so.
Speaker 1: Ted Ward?
Speaker 2: Yes, Ted Ward was a personal friend of my father.  They were very close.  As a child, you meet these people that are eventually will become giants, literary icons but, at the time, I wasn't aware of that.  Yes, I did meet Richard Wright.  Also, I do remember when we were living in Ida B. Wells [Homes], one day [HM] Margaret Burroughs brought this tall, black man and to the apartment or to the house, Paul Robeson.  I could still hear his voice.  He's about 6'6" I guess, big and very gentle and he came and spoke to my father because Margaret Burroughs knew Paul Robeson and I remember meeting him.  So the Langstons, Sinclair Drake, a lot of these other writers were active at the Abraham Lincoln Center.  I didn't know them personally but I came in contact with them 'cause my father knew all of these people.  And my father would--I'm not saying I was his favorite son, I guess I was the youngest.  He would just take me around, take me around and I'd just sit and watch and so I did come in contact with these people and later on, I realized who some of these people were.  Charles White was a personal friend of my father.  They were very close.  Charles White went to Englewood High School.  So, this Southside Boys Club was a 41st and Michigan.  And, Richard Wright worked there.  In fact, Bigger Thomas is a composite of black men that he came in contact with, not only in Jackson, Mississippi but also Chicago [Illinois].  And he says that.  And he met a lot of these unemployed men, used to hang out at the Southside Boys Club, now it's called the Elliott Donnelly Youth Center.  But at that time, it was the Southside Boys Club and Bigger Thomas worked there.  In fact, the book "Native Son" takes place in that area so he began to see the plight of young, black men being unemployed and, I think that's, that Bigger Thomas, his anti-hero sort of grew out of that experience.  And, so those are the main institutions, cultural institutions, the Lincoln, the Abraham Lincoln Center, the Southside Arts Center, Southside Boys Club and then later on, Margaret Burroughs began to develop the DuSable Museum of African American History.
Speaker 1: It seems as though you were surrounded by cultural activities at a high level when you were young person
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, right.
Speaker 1: You remember the House of Knowledge, was that (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yes, Hammurabi [Frederick H. Hammurabi Robb].  He was on the top floor of the Quincy Club.  Margaret Burroughs had purchased this building and one time he was at the Southside Arts Center and then I think he moved to the Quincy Club.  He knew my father very well and he always was talking about Africa, always talking about Africa.  And he would have classes.  I think a lot of people thought he was sort of crazy.  You know, in fact, he'd use the word, because he was different.  He would dress different and he used to wear this, I guess something like a Kufi quite a bit and always be talking about Africa.  But he had visited Africa many times and when I got to know him personally, he's just a genuine, sincere person and he used to come and do programs for me when I was at (unclear) foundation so I got to know how Hammurabi, F. H. Hammurabi, I believe that was his full title.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Frederick Rob, I think he was named (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yes, ok, F.R.  And, so that's where I first met him, either at the Southside Arts Center or else at DuSable Museum, where I think Margaret Burroughs allowed him to have some space there.  And, I'm trying to think of--I mentioned Ishmael Flory, who was just outstanding person--scholar.
Story_ID: 77908
Speaker 1: And I would frequent the DuSable Museum.  That was her [Margaret Burroughs] house, 3806 South Michigan [Chicago, Illinois] quite a bit.  Just sit around and see people.  There was always a conversation going on.
Speaker 2: So Dr. Burroughs had the museum in her house?:
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.  Oh, yeah, right there.  She had travelled to Africa several times.  Now DuSable Museum--she's a co-founder, other people were involved.  My father [Marion Perkins] was involved.  Dr. Lew, L-E-W, I remember, Eugene Pearlman--Feldman, who was a Jewish historian was involved.  So she had several people and the Pearlmans--Pearlman was a advertising--was in advertising.  So she had several people that--I think her first (unclear) husband, Bernard Goss, who was an outstanding artist.  Sort of got together and decided that they need to have a place where they could display the history of Africans and African Americans' artifacts and sculpture.  Groups, school groups used to come to that little place and tour it.  Edahl [ph.] did a fantastic mural in the basement that was really the highlight.  It was a history of the struggle of African American people.
Speaker 2: Now Edahl [ph.] was a
Speaker 1: Was an artist.  He was a muralist.  It was in the basement.  I don't know where that mural, if it was transplanted some place before the wall was done at 43rd and Langley.  Was a wonderful--was in the basement.  And you could hold people's attention for two or three hours because you could tell the story of the struggle.  And, so school children would come there.  And then on the second--on the first floor--that's where most of artifacts and sculpture and art were and classes so, it's just a lot of cultural activity.
Speaker 2: Now Dr. Burroughs still lives in that same place?
Speaker 1: Yes, 3806, she still lives there.
Speaker 2: So the mural is probably still in the basement?
Speaker 1: It may well be.  It may well be.  It was the Quincy Club when she purchased it and it was a mansion, really, which it still is, of course.
Speaker 2: AS the Quincy Club, it was like a night spot or something?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yep, like a night spot.  Yep.
Speaker 2: Well, all this--I hate to (laughter). I hope I've asked about everybody in this neighborhood.  The neighborhood was really just running over with culture.
Story_ID: 77909
Speaker 1: Your brother, one of your brothers became an artist.  I know he kind of followed in your father's footsteps.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Toussaint [Perkins], the second brother, yeah, he, yep, he became an artist, a painter, for the most part.  Great, great possibilities, I think Toussaint never did just stay focused on his art, began doing other things, began running news business, which he did for a long time.  And I didn't know they did that anymore.
Speaker 1: No, paperboy.
Speaker 2: They had news routes.  These paperboys would come early in the morning and stuff the papers and then go and deliver the papers.  And on weekends, we would collect.  I would help and that was on the west side and so (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: What Toussaint would do.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so, you know, Toussaint has never worked for anyone.  He's always been self-employed.  To my knowledge, I can't recall him having--is this on now--are we?
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're rolling.
Speaker 2: So my brother, Toussaint, always has been self-employed.  But he's a very good artist.  I just wish he had spent more time on that but then he had a family to raise and other responsibilities.
Story_ID: 77910
Speaker 1: So, tell me about high school.  Now you went to Wendell Phillips High School, right?
Speaker 2: Went to Wendell Phillips High School and--high school is great.  My writing began to develop a little bit more at Wendell Phillips because of--I was in the journalism class and Mrs. Proctor, who was the journalist--the journalism teacher and she took an interest in me and my writing.  But at that time, I would do most of the sports writing.  In fact, I was a sports editor, which was nice 'cause I could go out to the basketball games and be out there on the field.  I was writing about the sports but I was also writing poetry and then I would write some editorials.  The other person that I remember, Alfreda Duster, who is a granddaughter of Ida B. Wells, was also on the newspaper staff.  And I got to know her fairly well.  The Dusters lived in Ida B. Wells.  It's about seven or eight of them.  All of them became very prominent lawyers and doctors and so forth.  But they were the grandchildren.
Speaker 1: Actually, lived in Ida B. Wells [Homes]?
Speaker 2: Yes, the Dusters
Speaker 1: They were the grandchildren of Ida B.?
Speaker 2: Yes, right.  The grandchildren.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they lived in Ida B. Wells.  And, so Alfreda--so I was very much involved with the newspaper, which was nice 'cause it's something that I like to do.  I was interested in sports but I couldn't play sports because I had to work.  I always worked after school.  I worked downtown as a delivery boy, delivering flowers.  Worked at--I'm trying to think of his name--such a nice guy--at--near Randolph and State Street.  He was Greek and he had a little--in the lobby--he had a flower shop.  So I would come there after school every day.  I would deliver--it's no longer there in this particular building.  I would deliver flowers and he even taught me some of the craft of making bouquets and things like that.  And, I worked there after high--you know, I worked for George Winehover, Winehover who was a German, had the largest flower shop downtown.  It was on Wabash.  So I worked during the whole time I was in high school.  So I didn't play any sports in that time, other than the writing and I was a good student.  I was a better student in grammar student in grammar school.  I was almost a straight A student in grammar school, a straight E.  They didn't have As then.  In high school, I was a good student but some of the courses I just didn't like.  I didn't care too much for the science courses.  The geography course, I didn't like.  I liked the history, English and writing.  I think I used to write quite a bit even during--when I should have been doing something else.  So, Wendell Phillips had a strong tradition--Dr. Boswell was the first black principal of a high school and she always did a lot to inspire students to be representative of, of the race.
Story_ID: 77911
Speaker 1: Tell me more about [Wendell] Phillips High School.  Now at that time, most blacks students, did they not--went to either Phillips or DuSable and there were some in other schools (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Okay, it was four on the South Side, four schools.  Wendell Phillips was all black but, at one time, whites attended Wendell Phillips 'cause in that community whites lived--basically when I lived there, there was all black.  DuSable was all black.  Englewood was about two-thirds black when I went to school 'cause you still had a number of whites going.  And Dunbar was predominantly black.  On the West Side, you had Marshall, which was half and half and Crane.  But you still had whites attending both of those schools on the West Side, so Wendell Phillips would be, at the time that I attended but at one time I understand you did have some whites 'cause you had whites living there in the neighborhood, all around Lake Park.  I didn't mention that during World War II, that's where you had one of the largest concentration of Japanese that were sent to the camps in California.  You had a lot of Japanese living around 41st and Lake Park and Ellis, almost up to 47th Street, that was almost a Japanese community.  And, then, of course, they were removed during World War II and relocated on the West Coast.  But a lot of whites lived east of Cottage Grove.  Now the interesting thing about that--there was another grammar school called Oakenwald all white, just two blocks from Oakland because whites lived on the east side of Cottage Grove and Oakenwald was a all white school.  Another interesting thing about that area--and sometimes we tend to romanticize yesterday.  Everything was not perfect.  It wasn't Camelot, let me say that.  We had some problems.  You had gang problems but one of the biggest problems was drugs.  Thirty-ninth and Cottage and that area, Oakland Boulevard was called Dopeville USA.  You had more drugs circulating in that area, 'cause you had the DuSable Hotel, which was at 39th, no 40th Oakland Boulevard and Cottage Grove and it's just nothin' but drugs.
Speaker 1: And there was something called Ritz too?
Speaker 2: Ritz was down the street near King Drive and Heroin was the drug basically.  They called it Dopeville USA in that area.  A lot of drugs were being sold.  We used to see the drug addicts and make fun of 'em but the other people were not selling drugs.  Drugs were not being trafficked by--sold by young people.  The gangs that were in that area didn't have access to drugs but drugs were very prevalent in that particular area, for a long time.  But it did not have a direct impact on the community because it seemed like it was isolated.  And people knew about it but they didn't talk about it and young people were not involved.  Now my oldest brother eventually got involved with drugs, heroin, just shooting the needle. That was--
Story_ID: 77912
Speaker 1: And you had gangs--the Deacons was the largest gang.  That was primarily in Ida B. Wells 'cause my brother, Robert, was involved with the Deacons.  And you had the Destroyers, the 13 Cats.  So, but of course (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Destroyers and the 13 Cats?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Destroyers were north of 35th Street.  They called themselves the Destroyers, very large gang.  And the 13 Cats were Drexel going south, from Drexel to 41st, 43rd Street, 13 Cats.  And, now since my brother was the warlord for the Deacons, I was safe all in the area of Ida B. Wells but when I went across Oakwood Boulevard and, if they knew I was Robert's brother--that's little Perkins, let's get him.  Same way with the Destroyers but eventually we, I guess we had some type of a truce with the Destroyers 'cause the Destroyers used to come to Madden Park a lot and they used to have confrontations but mainly with sticks.  They had a few zip guns and just bare knuckle.  So gangs were very active but they didn't do too much recruiting.  If you wanted to join, that was up to you but they weren't forcing kids to join, to my knowledge 'cause I knew a lot of the older gang members.
Speaker 2: Were they involved in a lot of illegal activities, as the gang (unclear) or were they just turf?
Speaker 1: Yeah, they was just turf.  I don't know if they were involved in holdups or burglaries or anything like that, maybe individuals, but not to any great extent, as a collective, I didn't think that was happening.  They were just turf conscious and some of them were probably using drugs 'cause my brother start using drugs when he was involved with the gangs.
Speaker 2: You said that the gang users was typically older?
Speaker 1: Yeah, in their 20s and 30s.  You had a lot of pimps around the hotels, lot of prostitution, drugs.
Speaker 2: So a lot of musicians involved in drugs at that time?
Speaker 1: Well, you always thought they were so how active they were, I don't know but this is something I think that--because we would not go into these places.  You know, we would just walk past them and hear stories and things like that.  So what really went in--took place in DuSable Hotel and the Ritz Hotel, was just hearsay.
Speaker 2: Now your brother being involved, your older brother being involved in a gang and just--did your parents know about that or, did it worry them, if they didn't?
Speaker 1: Of course, I think eventually because he went to juvenile court.  My mother had to go so I think he went on probation.  I don't think--cause he joined the [U.S.] Navy early.  My brother joined the Navy, I think when he was seventeen or eighteen.  So he spent about three or four years in the Navy.  So my parents knew about some of his activities because he was--he wasn't adjudicated.  He didn't, you know, he wasn't sent to St. Charles but he did have a court appearance that I remember my mother had to attend.
Story_ID: 77913
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, in high school, you're writing and you told me about some of the teachers and some of the activities in high school and said you were a good athlete but you didn't play sports because you were--too busy working.
Speaker 2: Yes, right.  I was working.
Speaker 1: So when you were--say when you were a senior in high school, what did you--what did you think you would do?  Did you think you would go to college at that point?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, I always thought I was going to go to college.  Well, I wanted to--the problem was the money (laughter).  Okay, and I felt that sports could get me in.  Now people probably thought, well, you don't have a portfolio to showcase to any college but I was pretty confident.  And, a friend, Gayden [ph.] who was a friend of my father, social worker, knew someone at Winston Salem Teachers College in North Carolina and I felt that if I could go down there and make the team, I would get a scholarship.  I didn't have a portfolio to take with me, which I did.  I went down and played basketball and football so that was my entre into college.  I remember my mother was just so thrilled 'cause that was the first son, the first one to go to college and that, I know, I was, as poor as we were but she would send me five dollars a week.  And I would stretch that money out somehow, I don't know but--then I worked while I was in college, worked at car wash place, at the same time, because I was living off campus at first, before I could get a scholarship, then I could live on campus.  Winston Salem, which at that time, was a teacher's college.  Now it's a university, Winston Salem University.  And then I went to Knoxville College [Knoxville, Tennessee], the following year because I had some friends that went to Knoxville.  They told me you ought to go to Knoxville and I went to Knoxville and I played football and I played basketball at Knoxville.  I didn't run track at Knoxville but I ran track hurdles at Winston Salem.  I had--had never run hurdles in my life but I figure I could get over the barrier (laughter).  And I had seen--I had seen the athletes, being a sports editor.  I saw the three steps and over three steps and over and everything like that.  I ran against--what's the Olympic champion from Gary [Indiana], what was his name?  Of course, he was far in front of us but--his name just--but he won the Olympics.  He went to North Carolina College.  [Lee Quency] Calhoun--I think that was his name but he went to Gary, Indiana. I think it was--
Story_ID: 77914
Speaker 1: And, so, so again, I enlisted in the [U.S.] Air Force from Knoxville [College].
Speaker 2: Now, what happened in school that you--did you have a hard time trying, trying to find the money to stay in or, what happened?
Speaker 1: Well, at one point, I had--was getting a little tired and I wasn't doing too well.  At that time, they were drafting, during the Korean War and I definitely didn't want to be drafted so I thought it'd be best to maybe join the air force, where it may be a little softer than (laughter) than--(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Now you grad--you came--you came out of high school in 1950.
Speaker 1: Yes, right.
Speaker 2: So was this 1952, you joined the Air Force?
Speaker 1: Fifty-two[1952] or '53 [1953].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: After going to Winston Salem [Teachers College] for a year and then Knoxville College.  I joined the Air Force, went to San Antone [San Antonio], Texas, Lockland Air Force Base for my training.  And I never will forget one day, two guys on our first leave, we went in town to San Antonio.  And we were in uniform and we went to the Majestic Theater--I never will forget this--to see the House of Wax with--oh my goodness--I can't think of his--(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Price.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Vincent Price.  And you had to put on the 3D glasses.  We went up to the front entrance to buy our tickets.  They would not sell us tickets.  They said you had to go around the back.  So, I was used to that, having gone to school in Knoxville [Tennessee].  You have to remember, I was going to school during Jim Crow, discrimination, everything.  So we said, okay.  We went around the back.  We had to catch a freight elevator to go to the movie, to go into the movie house.  And (unclear).  And then afterwards, we said here we are, having enlisted in this service and we're being treated this way and take a freight elevator, one of 'em big freight elevators (laughter)--but that's--we saw the House of Wax and we had to put on those special glasses.  But I was only there for six months and then I went to Keesler Air Force Base from radio school.  And that's where I learned how to type and learned Morse Code and everything like that.  We used to talk in Morse Code.  But then something happened at Keesler Air Force Base, I think, the second day.  Keesler is right along the Biloxi, you know, it's in Biloxi, Mississippi, beautiful gulf coast.  They told us literally, as black airmen, not to go down there.  It wouldn't be safe.  They said we cannot be responsible.  Do not go down to the Gulf Coast.  So I didn't see the Gulf Coast until about twenty years later (laughter), when I found out how beautiful that area was, white sand, as you know, stretching from all along the coast of Mississippi, some parts of Texas.  So, we didn't go down because they had incidents down there that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: They had to fight to open that up, you know, 60s [1960].
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, so that was interesting, the Keesler Air Force Base.
Speaker 2: As you eluded to earlier, you had the court-martial trial because they felt you had lied about being associated with the Communist Party?  (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, yeah.  And, so that took place after I was shipped to Biggs Air Force Base.  And, there I was in the insulation squadron.  I didn't do anything.  I worked in the first sergeant's office 'cause I could type and I could write a little bit so he knew that my rank was frozen, airman second class and his name was Barbados.  He was an Italian, rough guy but we got along well.  And, I didn't do too much.  I played on the basketball team at Biggs Air Force Base.  I had a chance to travel but basically, it seemed like it was hands off of Perkins, just leave him alone.  They left me alone.  I didn't have to do any KP [Kitchen Patrol] or any of that stuff.
Story_ID: 77915
Speaker 1: Now did your father pass away when you were in the [U.S.] Air Force or in college or did he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: After I (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: When your mother and your father, they passed close together, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, but after I was discharged.  I was discharged with honorable discharge.  That was the main thing that I was determined to have.  At that point, I wanted to get out the service, since I was frozen and I had a opportunity.  I wanted to travel some other places but I couldn't.  But, I was determined not to get a bad conduct discharge, definitely not a dishonorable discharge and James Weldon--Weldon Humble was his name, this captain that represented me, who hated communist.  Well, you know, you would expect that.  But he didn't like black folks either (laughter).  He told me that but he did represent me and, and so I was discharged, honorable discharge, which means I got veterans, VA benefits, which allowed me to then attend George William school after I left the service.  But my parents died about a year after I came out the service.  Yep.
Speaker 1: That's pretty rough, they both, both of them (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Within six months, yes, my mother died.  She had a couple of--it was some type of cancer, stomach, internal cancer.  She had a couple operations.  She suffered quite a bit. My father, who had never been sick in his life, to my knowledge, died of a disease called multiple myeloma, which is like a, something like leukemia.  It's a rare bone cancer, very excruciating.  And my--Toussaint and I--we were right there when he expired.  We were just about right there in the room, so, yeah, he died suddenly and unexpectedly, multiple myeloma.
Story_ID: 77916
Speaker 1: Just about him though, there's some of his works that are still in the DuSable Museum [of African American History], right?  On display there?
Speaker 2: Well, we donated two pieces to the DuSable Museum, the head of John Pointe DuSable.  It's two heads, one, Fred Louris [ph.] who's a sculptor, did a head.  But my father was commissioned by the DuSable League of Women to do the piece.  And then there was another piece--my father was working on this sky watchers, which gonna be a series of statues representing Hiroshima tragedy, the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima.  And the heads are turned around and looking up, beautiful pieces and we gave one to the DuSable Museum.  They have that piece, so, but he was going to do a whole series on that, to show the impact that the atomic bombs had on the people of Japan.  His work, Man of Sorrow, the museum, art institute got that for about $300.  It was a purchase prize, Pauline Palmer, I think, purchased the prize, which means that if you win first place, they give you $300 and keep your piece of sculptor.  That was a lot of money then and now it's on permanent display, the Man of Sorrow, which is the black Christ and since then they purchased two of my father's works, Ethiopia, Awakening and another untitled piece, that are permanent.  So no other black artist has received that type of recognition that my father--this was later--after, of course, his passing.  I think he made very little money from this art, if any.  And we didn't keep up with all of his works, unfortunately.  So when he died, my father was a generous person, he lent his works to other people so we could not document where all of the pieces were and we could not disclaim or claimed pieces that we thought perhaps we should have had so it was sort of unfortunate.
Speaker 1: Today, he's sort of immortalized on the south side and the south shore on a mural, you know, it's at 91st and Jeffrey.
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, he's part of that mural that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Calvin Jones.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Calvin Jones did.  So he's received recognition now after twenty, thirty years.  'Cause he was a extraordinary artist, basically self-taught and with working all these different medias, he started even working in wire 'cause, with the newspaper, he start taking the wire that you would wrap up the newspaper and start making models from that.  But, I think his main talent was with the mallet and the chisel and you don't hardly see that anymore.
Speaker 1: No, they have an electric device now that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You turn on and, you know, you don't need a mallet anymore.
Speaker 2: And then the welders thing (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 77917
Speaker 1: You went directly to George Mason when you came back, and (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: George Williams.
Speaker 1: George Williams, (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Which is YMCA College.
Speaker 1: (unclear).
Speaker 2: Because at that time--I had--I've always was interested in doing some type of service work.  I wanted to work with young people and that was a good opportunity.  It was--I could adjust my work 'cause I got married, my first marriage.  I was a milkman, I worked as a laundry man.  Ishmael Floris and I, we worked for the Eclipse Laundry at 75th and, near Cottage Grove, carry those sixty, seventy, eighty bags of--two or three flights.  I was a milkman, I worked for Borden Milk Company for 'bout a year.  I was also a bus driver, CTA [Chicago Transit Authority] bus driver, for about a year and a half.  All these jobs, I was going to school at the same time, raising a family, had just got married.  And I also was a switchman out at the belt railroad, after I came out of the service--so those are some of the--and I was, I drove a cab on weekend for the Yellow Cab Company and I was taking as many hours as I could because most of the hours that I had accumulated at the black schools were not accepted.  I almost started as a freshman.  You could literally say I was a freshman after going almost two years of college at Winston Salem Teachers College, in Knoxville.  When I came out of the service, I almost had to start point zero.  So I had to work and these are some of the jobs that I had and I remember when we used to drive a bus.  It's not like today, you had to punch a transfer, you had to make the change, you had the change on you, you didn't have a box so people could drop the change in.  And then you had to drive and then you had to deal with the customers, the back and forth.  It was a challenge.  It was really a challenge, the bus.  Since I had worked just about all my life.  I mean work was just something which--was something that I, you know, expected to do.  So, then I started writing.  During all this time, I was writing.  I was writing in the service.  I wrote for the school paper at Knoxville College.  So all this time, I was writing at the same time.  Doing a lot of writing in the--was trying to write a novel in the service.  I think I had about 150 pages, I lost the whole--everything.  That was unfortunate.  And it seemed like I was writing a novel which was--that mirrored a lot of native sons.  Seem like I was writing another "Native Son" (laughter).  You know, I wasn't plagiarizing but, you know, I was writing about this black boy growing up in Ida B. Wells and that area and everything like that, sort of a "Native Son" because of the impact that "Native Son" had on me but I lost that whole manuscript and then I just forgot.  I said, well, the novel is just not my forte because poetry was really my first love and still is.  And, I started writing a lot of poetry at the onset of the black arts movement.  But, you have to remember, I sort of bridge both.  I walked into the black arts movement but before that I was involved with the Southside Writers Club.  Gwendolyn was not that active but her husband, Henry Blakely was and other writers.  So that was--and Herb Nipson, who was at "Ebony" magazine.  So I was involved with the Southside Writers Club.  Then the emergence of the black arts movement developed and (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Now, let's see now, we're in the mid-50s [1950s], I guess. (Simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Mid-60s [1960s]
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous).  Mid-60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So that, that period of time, now when did you finish George Williams?
Speaker 2: Sixty-one [1961].
Speaker 1: (unclear).
Speaker 2: Maybe '61 [1961].
Speaker 1: And then you went on from Masters or what have you done (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and then I did my Masters at George Williams also.  So I think that was '62 [1962], '63 [1963].
Story_ID: 77918
Speaker 1: Now what did you--what was the impact of the (unclear) Civil Rights Movement on you in the late 50s [1950s].  I know [Rev.] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was involved in Montgomery [Alabama], and when did you--did you write poems about that or did you feel to?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I wrote a lot of poems.  I wish I had been a little more conscientious of preserving my poems.  But having been in the south, I saw that.  I saw what was taking place.  I had--although a lot of Jim Crowism was right here in Chicago [Illinois].  There was places in Chicago you couldn't go to when I was young, downtown.  You couldn't go to Marshall Fields.  I mean you could go into the store but you couldn't go to the restaurant.  There were places right here in Chicago and definitely if you went on the north side, you were not welcome in any of the restaurants and places there but they didn't have the sign.  The first time I went to Winston Salem [North Carolina](laughter) and I saw for colored only and for whites only and I said what is this?  So I was--in Knoxville [Tennessee].  So the Civil Rights Movement, I saw at the beginning, before the sit and demonstrations and [North Carolina] A and T [State University].  I used to go to A and T, because, I mean in terms of visiting 'cause it was only about forty miles from Winston Salem Teacher's College, where you have North Carolina State and you had A and T and you had Bennett College, all female.  And I got a sense then that it was a lot of discontent among students.  And I wasn't a visionary, I'm not saying that I knew that afterwards 'cause that started, I think, after the--during the service--Korean War--with the sit-in movements.  But you could sort of get a sense, at that time, that students were becoming fed up with some of the Jim Crow laws taking place in the south.  So I saw the Civil Right Movement from the beginning.  And, I used to write poems about the Civil Rights Movement.  I don't think I was ever really sold on the non-violent piece.
Story_ID: 78223
Speaker 1: And when did you get your first job in social work 'cause you went to school for social work, right?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, George Williams wasn't a social work school.  Basically, it was a school that really prepared you to work in the YMCA, which is in the human service profession.  My first job was with a--at the Furman House.  No--well, I did field work at the Woodlawn Boys Club, Bob Charlie was the director and that's where I first met Jeff Fort.
Speaker 1: Jeff Fort (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: And Lamar Bell, the Black Stone Rangers (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: The Black Stone Rangers, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, I met him when he was about eleven or twelve years old.  And the, the genesis of that group got started around the Woodlawn Boys Club, that's why they called themselves the Black Stone Rangers 'cause a lot of 'em went to the Woodlawn Boys Club.  So I did field work there.  And then I also worked at the Ada S. McKinley but this was my field work 'cause you have to do field work in your--but this was doing graduate work.  But to be more specific, my first page was at the Furman Settlement House at 53rd and Princeton.  William Neil was the director.  And, I was like a counselor, worked with the teens, pre-teens, not pre-teens but the adolescents, basketball, little league, some group work.  Basically, that was my area of specialty, group work, working with groups.  And, it was a place, the settlement house, but we would have club meetings and do a lot of trips and I coached the kids in baseball, had a little league baseball team and basketball.  So I worked there for about four or five years at Furman Settlement House.  Then, I went to the Henry Horner Boys Club on the west side 'cause it was a job dealing with street gangs.  It was called Chicago Youth Development Project.  So I was what they called a detached worker, which means that you worked outside of the social service agency and you worked with the so-called street kids.  And, that's when I first begin working with, quote gang-related kids and so forth, at the Henry Horner Boys Club.
Speaker 1: About what year is this now, in the early 60s [1960s]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I would think, well, the early 60s [1960s], '64 [1964], yeah, '63 [1963] or '64 [1964].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a couple of years.  Warner Saunders also worked at the Henry Horner Boys Club 'cause I became the supervisor and then I became the program director.  I was on the street for a couple of years and then they put me inside the building to run the program 'cause I was always a good organizer and dealing with--Robert even worked for me there.  He was my arts and crafts person.  You know, Robert.
Speaker 1: Robert Lewis?
Speaker 2: Yes, Robert Lewis was arts and crafts, worked for Blakely--can't think of his first name.  He was the first black director of a boys club in Chicago.  So that was a little prestigious working in that environment.  Major Adams, that name you may have heard--that's where I first met Major Adams, and he was the maintenance man but he knew more about running the program than I did.  He was a very--he helped me quite a bit to get to know the community, to get to know the kids, to get to know the families 'cause he was well liked and Major Adams had a drum and bugle corps.  So after a couple of years (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Why did they call him Major, was that his name?
Speaker 2: Because, because he had a drum and bugle corps.  So he's a major, that's where he got the (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: I know now they have Major Adams Boys Club now (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, well that's named after Major Adams.  But that's why they call him major because he had this drum and bugle corps.  And the kids looked up to him.
Story_ID: 78224
Speaker 1: And then I went to the Better Boys Foundation.  Warner [Saunders] had left Henry Horner and went to the--well it wasn't Better Boys Foundation at that time, it was the Archie Moore Gym.  Archie Moore, one time light heavyweight champion.  And even almost became heavyweight champion.  Joe Kelman, rich, millionaire, who was in the glass business founded the Archie Moore Gym because black youth that had worked for him named Black was involved--Hollis Black--I think was his name was involved with a murder of a armory, a armor car (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Driver?
Speaker 1: Driver, on the north side and he was a promising boxer.  So Mr. Kelman started the Archie Moore Gym.  He knew Archie Moore.  And, at that time, they just had a gym.  They would do a lot of weight lifting.  And Warner knew I was good in programming and they got this special grant from the Ford Foundation Development Program to work with young kids so he asked me did I want to come over there and do that.  I thought it was interesting, something I always wanted to do and so that's when I came to Better Boys Foundation.  But it was still Archie Moore Gym.  We named it Better Boys Foundation, I think, a couple of years afterwards.  And I worked there for about eighteen years, as a program director and when Warner left and went on television, I became the director.
Story_ID: 78225
Speaker 1: But we had some exciting programs at Better Boys Foundation.  We had a theater, started the Lemont Zeno Theater.
Speaker 2: Now who is Lemont Zeno?
Speaker 1: Lemont Zeno was--four of our staff people died in a plane crash on the way to West Virginia, Lemont was one of four.  Edison Hoard who was attorney was also a pilot, he was on the board.  They decided to look at a camp for kids.  We were gonna send our kids to this camp, someplace in Virginia, I forgot.  Originally, I was gonna go but then I was involved with some, I think, African Liberation Program.  Bill Smith was a school teacher.  He worked as a counselor; Rita Cody was a senior at Northeastern University, she went and Lemont Zeno was a program director and Edison Hoard was a lawyer but he was president of the board and he had a Cessna, six passenger and en route to West Virginia, it crashed in the mountains. And, that was devastating 'cause I had to--I was the director at the time and I had to go to the families, inform them of the tragedy, the funerals that took place afterwards.  So Lemont was interested in theater so when we decided to start a theater program, we thought it would be appropriate to name it after Lemont Zeno. So that's how the theater was named Lemont Zeno Theater.  And I think that our theater was the first on the west side to do any black drama.  And, we really began, I think, the whole moving towards children's theater.  I know we did because we did some of the children plays at our theater and years later, you have ETA, they do children plays or chocolate chips.  They do children plays and a few--and even here at Chicago State University.  But, I think that we were one of the first to really focus on children plays.  And we did a lot of my plays at Lemont Zeno but we did some of Oscar Brown's early plays.  We had a standing director, Pemon Rami was our director and (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Can you spell his name for us?
Speaker 1: Pemon, P-E-M-O-N, Rami, R-A-M-I.
Speaker 2: Right.  And (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: And Masaqua also worked for us.  She was his wife.
Speaker 2: Masaqua right?
Speaker 1: Masaqua.  I don't know if I can spell that (laughter) (simultaneous.)
Speaker 2: Spell (simultaneous)(Laughter).
Speaker 1: M-A-S-A-Q-U-A, I think so I'm
Speaker 2: Okay.  And then Lemont Zeno, can you spell that one for us?
Speaker 1: Oh, Lemont Zeno, L-E-M-O-N-T, Zeno Z-E-N-O.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's just for the historical record.
Speaker 1: Yes, I understand.  So, so we were very proud of the development on the West Side because all of a sudden, busloads of kids be coming there to see these plays.  That had never happened before.  People said well, what's going on--I mean--on the west side?  'Cause the west side always had a certain image of being backwards for some reason (laughter), you know, even among blacks that lived on the south side, and they began to see all these things that take place.  And, then we also did a lot of African American activities.  [HM] Lerone Bennett came several times to speak to our kids, [HM] Sonia Sanchez.  We were doing things that were not traditional social service, Kwanzaa Programs, and a number of other activities, I think, focusing on Afrocentric activities.  And that was, that was unusual at that time (laughter).  We talking about the late 60s [1960s] and 70s [1970s], on the west side of Chicago.  So we were doing all of these things that Better Boys Foundation (unclear), we were very innovative programming working with juveniles in the streets and start doing work in the prison. That's when I started doing my prison work at Pontiac Prison.  I would go there every week with Eugene Feldman, who was a archivist at the DuSable Museum [of African American History].   We mentioned his name earlier 'cause he was also one of the founders of the DuSable Museum.  At that time, DuSable Museum was in Washington Park.  And, then we started the first African American Studies Program at Pontiac.  We were teaching--I was teaching creative writing at Pontiac and we were doing that for about five years, so, Better Boys Foundation enabled me to do a lot of things.
Story_ID: 78226
Speaker 1: In fact, my first published book that Third World Press published came out of my experiences on the West Side--that's why we call it "Home Is A Dirty Street", the social impression of black children, published in 1975.
Speaker 2: Hadn't you published some poetry?
Speaker 1: Poetry, yes.
Speaker 2: What were some of your poetry books?  (unclear) and then we'll catch back up to that one.
Speaker 1: First book of poems was published by Adams Press, really.  "An Apology To My African Brother", that was published in 1961.
Speaker 2: (unclear).
Speaker 1: That was my first book of poems published.
Speaker 2: Now what was the essence of that?  I mean--it has an intriguing title, "An Apology To My African Brother", what was that?
Speaker 1: I was recognizing my African heritage and I think prior to that I had not really exemplified that.  I had not really expressed myself that Africa is my home and so I was--I thought it was appropriate to write the title, "An Apology To My African Brother".  Of course, I don't remember the words.  I don't remember the words of any of my poems (laughter).  But, but it was an appeal to my African brothers saying that I'm sorry that I have not really accepted you as I should and that I've still been exposed to all these Eurocentric types of images and so that's--that was the basis of it.
Story_ID: 78227
Speaker 1: Afterwards, Ruwa Chiri from Zimbabwe responded.  And (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Can you spell the name for us.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: R-U-W-A, Chiri, C-H-I-R-I responded to my poem, an acknowledgement of my African brother and we became dear friends.  And, eventually he alleged to have taken his life in a subway in New York, which no one believes.
Speaker 2: He was an organizer of an African Liberation Movement based here (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: In support of Freedom Fighters of Zimbabwe.
Speaker 1: He was very active which was very unusual for Africans.  They usually come here and they stay out of the political thing because it was not in the best interest and I think they had revoked his visa, passport and would not extend it.  And people said he went in to hiding and so forth.  But he was very political and he went to New York and he died under the subway train.
Speaker 2: He is someone here in Chicago--I know had people organized, had an office organized
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And people actually working in a structure way (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Forget the name of his organization (laughter).
Speaker 2: Something about the (unclear).
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And, people still remember Ruwa Chiri 'cause (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: He was--how did he die again?  Did you (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Well, allegedly he took his life.  He committed suicide.  Well, of course, when you took your life.  Now, interesting enough (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: What was it in the subway?
Speaker 1: In the subway.  He supposed to have jumped in front of a subway train.  They said he was so disillusioned, so disenchanted because they were going to force him to go to back to Zimbabwe, which had been death for him, had he went back during that time, at the height of apartheid.  It would have death and he did not want to go back and it seem like the government wanted to force him out.  And, I think they revoked his passport or else his visa and then he went into hiding,in communicado.  But interesting, the reason why during this time, I also became a publisher.  In fact I think that I start publishing almost at the same time Broadside Press under Dudley Randle in Detroit, maybe before Dudley.  This was in '65 [1965], I think.  Dudley started around the same time, that was before Third World Press.  Ironically, three of the poets that I published allege to have taken their lives.  Ruwa Chiri, I published his work, and we mentioned about his death.  Sigmund Wemberly, who lived in Oklahoma, who worked on the west side, I published his ghetto scenes, allegedly took his life in a jail house, not too far from Tulsa, Oklahoma.  I went there to do some follow-up.  He was in a domestic altercation with his wife, he was arrested, they took him to the police station and then the next day, they said he had hung himself.  And, Cynthia Conley, who went under the pen name Sister Sabrina, she did take her life, I think some overdose of pills.  She had just finished school, dear friend, wrote several books of poems and she was just disillusioned, disenchanted with life.  She had two children and maybe her husband had sort of went off with another woman, a white woman and I think that probably added to her frustration.  So that, that was--here--three poets that I published, took their lives.  And earlier, I told you about the airplane crash with four workers that worked with me at Better Boys Foundation died in the crash.  So, you know, I've seen some tragedy.  All those touched me quite a bit because they were people that I knew very well.
Story_ID: 78228
Speaker 1: And you mentioned, well, Fats Crawford, he was (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Fats Crawford, yes, that was some time later, died at a police station.  He was--Fats Crawford headed the Deacons for Defense in Chicago.  And he came here, I think, in the late 60s [1960s].  The west (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: He was active when Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was here, right?
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: In 68 [1968]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, he was one of the guards--they would--the Deacons Defense.
Speaker 1: So he died much later, after that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: He died in the early, sometime in the 70s [1970s], yes, yeah, much--'cause he was working for us at the Better Boys Foundation.  But the west side was really where all the activity, political activity was really.  The organizations, Garfield Organization.  They had the Black Hand Society (laughter).
Speaker 1: (unclear) Lookman, right?
Speaker 2: Lookman was on the west side.  Seem like the level of political consciousness, I think that's why the greatest confrontations took place because the community was more expressive of doing something about the assassination of Dr. King and so forth.  Most of the so-called insurrection activities took place on the west side, Madison, Washington Street.  I mean it was like--the National Guard came out for two days.  It was really under martial law, the west side of Chicago [Illinois], You had those large armored cars, heavy artillery would be up and down Pulaski, 16th Street.  That didn't take place on the south side.
Speaker 1: And why do you think the south side wasn't as involved, because of that?
Speaker 2: Well, I think for the reasons that I cited.  You had some organizations on the west side that were very serious about revolution.  They just didn't talk about revolution, the Black Hand Society, I wasn't a part of it but I know it was a consortium of several organizations.  In fact, Sonny Landry, who went to [Washington] D.C.  I think he's expired, was, I think, involved.  West Side Organization was very active.  Archie Hargraves passed away last year was involved with the west side.  The Garfield Organization, Doug Andrews was accused of trying to destroy certain buildings.  He was arrested (unclear).  The Black Panthers got started on the west side, Fred Hampton, they were at Madison and Western.  In fact, the Black Panthers had their--a breakfast program in Better Boys Foundation.  That was the first one and we got a lot of criticism and a lot of our white contributors stopped contributing monies and everything like that.  But our rationale was--it's not so much that we supported the doctrine of the Black Panthers but what they were doing was something very positive.  They were feeding thee kids.  We didn't see anything wrong with that.  And the only thing we agreed on was that they would not politicize the kids, which they didn't.  They did not try to politicize these kids.  They would come there as early as 6:00 in the morning 'cause I would have to be there to let 'em in most of the time and start setting up for these kids, for the breakfast programs.  You know, three years after that, the City of Chicago started doing their breakfast programs on a regular basis.  Then on 16th Street, you had the health center that the Black Panthers had.  So you had all this activity.  You had some of the more progressive gangs, the Vice Lords which then changed their names to the Progressive Vice Lords.  They had art store.  They had an African boutique.  They had a restaurant.  It seem like that they were moving into a more political arenas.  They even took the leadership in the--what did they--they had in D.C., it was one of the first time that gang members came together, from all over the country.  I wasn't there but the Vice Lords was basically the--that spearheaded that.  They--I know they stayed in Tent City, near Washington.
Speaker 1: Oh, oh, so they just paid into poor people's campaign?
Speaker 2: Yes, but after it was torn down.  So all these activities were taking place on the west side.  This is why it was more expressive of disenchantment that was prevailing throughout the black community.  They were organized and they weren't just talking about revolution.  They were ready to really--I don't want to over-dramatize (laughter) or be melodramatic but you're talking about fighting, war, they were ready.
Story_ID: 78229
Speaker 1: Now you said before we broke last time that you were not in favor of non-violence and you couldn't--found it hard to embrace that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You were on the west side when Dr. [Martin Luther]King [Jr.] came to Chicago [Illinois], right?
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: And then--what was--did you have as much interaction with Dr. King?
Speaker 2: My first book of poems, "An Apology For My African Brother", I wrote a poem to Dr. King and he signed my book.  I didn't take it to him but I knew someone--I had a high respect for Dr. King.  I just didn't think non-violence made much sense to me personally.  So, and in fact he stayed in the apartment on Hamlet, which was about three blocks from where Better Boys Foundation was and, during that time.  So--and, of course, after the assassination, the west side just went up in flames and I did what little I could to keep the kids off the streets and had kids in Better Boys Foundation.  It was a very violent situation.  Some people don't realize, people were just being shot at and police were--that's when the Mayor Daley had given the order 'shoot to kill' and I mean 'shoot to kill' anyone that was stealing anything and looting was taking place all up and down State Street, all up and down Madison, stores were being burned down, and everything like that and the police had this--these order to 'shoot to kill' and it was devastating.  It was war and so, you know, we were trying to keep the young people off the streets, the young people from being involved in these incidents. Okay.
Story_ID: 78230
Speaker 1: I guess the, the most well-known of your works, I guess, is a play called the "Black Fairy."  And (unclear), I believe that to be the most well-known of your works.
Speaker 2: It's been around a long time (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean it seems to be--I mean other than the sociology books, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, right.
Speaker 1: --Black Fairy is probably the most well-known piece.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That's a children's play, and you use a lot of ingredients from the neighborhood to make it work.  I mean, you know, things that Kids--hear kids say on sidewalk, walking, in the community.  And, tell me about the origin of that?  How you conceive it--you know, there's been a record of it since the 70s [1970s].  It's been published all over the place and--
Speaker 2: Well, really, I used to take my daughter, Julia, to the Goodman Theater and see all the children's plays:  Rumpelstiltskin, Snow White, Hansel and Gretel and so forth, Cinderella.  And, I recall one day she asked me, "Are there any plays about black kids, about us?"  And, I thought about it and so "Black Fairy" was really written in narrative form and I sent it to the--what was it--the Interracial Council on Books and it received second place.  It received an award.  And when I, when I got it back, or after the--it received the second place, I thought I'd put it into a play form.  I was interested in plays so I just changed it into a play form, and I knew music was important because it, basically, it was going to be for children.  And, we had on our staff Tony Lorenz, very talented musician, and so Tony wrote the music, Pemon Rami was excited about it.  He directed the play--interesting "Hey Black Child", which is recited by kids (laughter) even today all over the city, especially in the schools.  Some schools recite it every day as a pledge.  I wrote that the night before the play was going to open, or two nights before, because Pemon suggested we needed to end the play on up tempo because Johnny had been disillusioned and "Black Fairy" took Johnny throughout history--we wanted to show different times of history, achievements of black folks and relate it to the streets, which "Black Fairy" does with queen mother.  And so "Hey Black Child" is really a song, most people just read it as a poem but I wrote that about two nights before and Tony wrote the music and we put it in the play because, I think, it had an up tempo beat to it and that poem has been around since 1975.  So that's how "Black Fairy" really came about and I follow that with "Young John Henry," "Deadwood Dick" and since then I've written about seven or eight children plays, musicals.  And I think that now you have others doing children plays.  Runako Jahi at ETA [Creative Arts], very talented playwright and he writes children plays.  Now because, at one time, everybody would just do my plays.  It was no other, at least locally.
Story_ID: 77927
Speaker 1: Can you recite "Hey Black Child" for us?
Speaker 2: Well, not really.
Speaker 1: (unclear) It was so important.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'll try but, for some reason, all the poems I've written, I don't remember, "Say, hey black child, do you know who you are, who you really are?  Do you know you can be what you want to be, if you tried to be what you can be.  Hey, black child, do you know you strong, I mean really strong.  Hey black child be what you can be.  Do what you can do, tomorrow your nation will be what you want it to be"?  But I left out a couple of verses.  I've never--I think that as a writer, we don't see ourselves as a performer, at least I don't see myself so when I'm invited to read, I have to read from the page.  Now there are poets that are writers that memorize their poems. It may have more dramatic appeal but "Hey Black Child" is not a complicated poem.  These kids learn it in one day but I've never really memorized my writings.  So, it's the best I can do.  (Simultaneous)
Speaker 1: There may be poets with better delivery but I don't think anybody's written a poem with that much impact.  And, I mean you see it all over.  You see it in schools, in other cities, on the wall.  You see it in churches, you see it all over the place.  I mean it's--I'm always surprised at where I see that poem (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, I am too (laughter).
Speaker 1: When I tell people I know you, they say--oh, you know him?  I mean people don't think that the author is accessible and that's something that needs to be addressed too in a way 'cause people--I think a lot of times grown in the black community, as well as their children don't think that the authors of works really exist and you can talk to 'em.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You got a chance to meet people.
Speaker 2: Yes, right.  You're right.  I've heard that many times.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're surprised when somebody is actually alive that wrote something (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 77928
Speaker 1: Yeah, well tell us about the "Image Makers".  That was--made a bigger impact at the time than Black Fairy did.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well,"Image Makers" came about as the result of black exploitation film that were end vogue during this time, what mid 60s [1960s], early 70s [1970s], Dracula, Superfly.  The one that really set it off was Superfly, I just did not think that movie merit the acclaim that some people was giving it.  You know it was highly controversial.  Huey Newton supported it, thought it was one of the most revolutionary film ever written.  It was published in the "Black Panther Paper."  [HM] Lerone Bennett,[Jr.] you know, said just the opposite.  I remember a meeting at Kuumba, they talked about the movie.  That was a very controversial movie--this pimp-like becoming a revolutionary because he does have a confrontation with a policeman, but anyway, that and some of the other black exploitation movies.  And, I wanted to do a satire.  And, so, it just came.  I really wrote--I wouldn't tell everyone this--I really wrote "Image Makers" in about a week, didn't take long because I knew what
Speaker 1: Let's pause for a second (knocking).
Speaker 2: Lerone.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a lot going on over there now.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: We're rolling?
Speaker 2: (Off camera - yes, we're rolling)
Speaker 1: So the "Image Makers was sort of natural.  I wanted to make statement.  I wanted it to be a satire.  I wanted to have a political impact.  And I shared it with Val.  I didn't have anyone in mind.  Writers, we writers because we feel that, you know this is what we supposed to do so, I think, it has been said that [HM] Val [Gray Ward] sort of asked me to write "Image Makers", was commissioned me but I don't think that's important.  She liked it because the Kuumba [Theater] players were involved with making political statements and I know that they had taken positions against these movies, black exploitation film, so it fitted very well.  I think soon as Val (sp?) saw it, she said we got to do this.  And, I think she mounted it in about a month or two months after that.  And, at that time, "Image Makers" was very popular.  It was performed by Kuumba throughout Chicago [Illinois], Milwaukee [Wisconsin] and many of the colleges in the Midwest and it was performed in Lagos, Nigeria during Fest Day.  I was unable to go.  I was invited but I couldn't attend 'cause they keep--they kept putting the Fest back off.  The year that I wanted to go, they cancelled it and they put it off later on, so they did very well with "Image Makers".  And, that was one of my earlier plays that I think had--I don't think it was, you know, one of my best artistic plays, but sometimes timing has a lot and I think the timing was just right, that people wanted some reaction to these black exploitation film and Kuumba did an excellent job, the production.  She had some of the performers--I think you played in "Image Makers" once.
Speaker 2: No, no I (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: No, you didn't play.  Okay, I forget.
Speaker 2: (unclear) ...anyone following black theater in those days (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Yeah, it had a lot of people, good performers.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Black World publicized it quite a bit (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: And that helped out.  So (simultaneous)
Story_ID: 77929
Speaker 1: I really became interested in writing plays much earlier in life.  Although I had not really began because I was writing poetry, essays. I'd finished the book, "Home Is A Dirty Street", but I've always was interested in playwriting.  My father [Marion Perkins] took me to see "Othello" with Paul Robeson and we went to the Erlanger Theater downtown and we were sitting up in the peanut gallery and I was just awed by this man, this majestic black man who came on the stage, and that was with Jose Ferrer, Uta Hagen that was the famous cast.
Speaker 2: Right.  Desdemona--
Speaker 1: Played Desdemona.  And I just knew I had to begin writing plays at some point in my life.  I was just, just--and I began reading plays.  Shakespeare, beyond doubt is just a fantastic playwright.  I mean the way he deals with character, I've read "Hamlet" over and over and over and "Henry V," a lot of his plays. And O. Henry, and, the Russian--O. Henry was mainly short stories.  I'm thinking about the--Chekhov, Anton Chekhov the Russian playwright.  I had a lot of admiration for Chekhov.  It wasn't too many black playwrights that I would read about.  I wasn't too familiar with black playwrights.  I was familiar with black poets and black novelists because at that time many had been published but not black plays.  And, I remember hearing about the "Dutchman," Lerone--I mean Leroi Jones (laughter).  And it just sound like an interesting play.  I didn't see it until about ten years afterwards though.  But it won the Obie [Off-Broadway Theater Award], I think, Leroi Jones was in Greenwich Village [New York, New York] and his poem "Preface To A Twenty Volume Suicide," which I think is probably one of his best works, this volume of poems, "Preface To A Twenty Page Suicide Note," or something like that, beautiful.  So he, I guess, I'm just saying that he had a influence on me, as a poet and a playwright, but I didn't see the "Dutchman" until about ten years after I heard about it.  But at least it motivated me to begin thinking about writing plays.  I did see "The Slave Ship."  It came down to Chicago [Illinois] at the Eleventh Street Theater, Archie Shepp's music in the background, powerful drama.  Play on page was only about five or six pages but such a powerful statement and the acting and the set and everything like that.  And that's when I really became more involved in playwriting.  Ted Ward, whom I had known for some time, who was a personal friend of my father, I looked up to Ted.  I think the first--gee, I almost forgot I wrote this play "Turn A Black Cheek" about the Civil Rights Movement about the [North Carolina] A and T [State University] students who went to the Woolworth five and ten store.  I wrote about that, that was very early.  We did that at the Center for Inner City Studies.  So I've written many plays, a lot have not been produced.  Professor JB did at the Expe [ph.], all of the children plays but, I think a lot of my plays are historical plays and sometimes they're a little heavy, little political 'cause I've written plays about Denmark Vesey, Steve Biko, W.E.B. DuBois.
Speaker 2: [Jean Baptiste Point] DuSable?
Speaker 1: DuSable, that's been done, the children's play.  So--and several others.  ETA did some parts of Biko.  Runako [Jahi] used to like the road, Steve Biko definitely.  And Fred Hampton would play (unclear), Fred Hampton.  [HM] Val Gray [Ward] who is one of the founders of the Kuumba--said that was one reason why they start getting these city code violations, the police after the Fred Hampton play because it sort of points at the police as being primarily responsible.
Story_ID: 77930
Speaker 1: So during all this time, I'm almost developing two careers because, as a writer, some recognition, at least locally.  But it wasn't about recognition.  It was about me doing something that I felt was important 'cause all during this period, I was working full time, working with youth and working with so-called gang kids, working out in the streets and writing books, writing essays, doing workshops all over the country, doing all kinds of things.  I wanted to--I said I'm gonna be an expert, and there's no such thing but, I think, within the context, on black youth.  I wanna know more about black youth than any one else in my field.  I think I've just about achieved that.  I don't know, it may be sort of an over-statement, but at least I've made an area to study, to read just about everything I could.  So when I go to conference, when I do a workshop, I have all this information but I have empirical information, too 'cause I work with young people.  Even today, I work with young people.  I go out and work with groups.  I been going out to the St. Charles Correctional Center for years.  So it's not just for my academic situation but it's also empirical working directly with young people and that's what I wanted to be.  I wanted to be--'cause it seem like all experts were white (laughter) that were writing books about black youth, just about all of 'em.  And, I said, well, no, I'm working with black youth.  And, and, and I think that I've gained some credibility.  I know the black social workers acknowledge me first when they acknowledge their awards, way back in the 70s [1970s].  I still feel that way, as long as I'm working with the youth.
Story_ID: 77931
Speaker 1: --the same time, I'm still developing as a writer because that's a lifetime task and I was very fortunate last year, I was given the--by the Black Theater Network, a national organization of black theater, people mainly related to universities and colleges, gave me the playwriting award.  It came as a surprise but, I think, it dealt with a body of work and I think a lot of it was influenced by "If We Must Die", the play that I wrote two years ago that we took to Tulsa, Oklahoma, which dealt with the Tulsa race war and we performed it here in Chicago [Illinois] and there may be some other possibilities.  So I think that had a lot to do with it and recently Third World published a collection of my poems, "Memories and Images", which I was pleased.  So I think I'm gonna begin writing more poetry.  There's a couple of plays that I really write, one is on William L. Dawson (laughter).  Very little out about Dawson, yet he was one of the most powerful, one of the most, was the most powerful black politician in the history of this country and all the other, even before Oscar DePriest.  Oscar DePriest didn't have too much power but all the politicians that came after Dawson came through him, [Ralph H.] Metcalfe, Harold Washington, you name 'em, they came through Dawson.  And Dawson was somewhat of an enigma because he did a lot for black folks but he didn't support the Civil Rights Movement (laughter).  He didn't, you know, he just said people want jobs.  He wasn't a supporter of Dr. Martin Luther King [Jr.] at all.  He wasn't involved in the Civil Rights Movement, although he was very outspoken as a senator, not as a senator, as a congressman.  And he's been criticized a lot but I need to do more research--I'm really interested, I think the man really set the whole mold for politics, especially on the South Side of Chicago.  So, so it's still a lot of research has to be done.
Story_ID: 77932
Speaker 1: Now you--were you a member of Obassi?
Speaker 2: No, I never was a member of Obassi.  When Obassi got started, I was involved with the Southside Writer's Group that actually came under my wing which I shared with Herb [Herbert] Nipson.  Now we would meet almost on the same nights.  We would meet at the Southside Arts Center and Obassi would meet at DuSable [Museum of African American History], at 3806 Michigan [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: And Obassi was basically (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Well, Hart Fuller (ph.) was the one that actually started but at that time--so--but we all related to each other.  Donald Lee Harkey, Angela Jackson, Carolyn Rogers, Ameni--I'm trying to think of her (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Jahari?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Jahari --so, but we were having a workshop and I had the, a group and we published a couple of anthologies.  So I was not a member of Obassi.  And, then we have this cultural movement on the beach, which really was the offspring for the Afro Arts Theater because when [HM] Phil [Philip] Cohran (left--on the beach--I coordinated that program.  And it dealt with all facets of black art, as you know.  Phil Cohran was a feature attraction with Artistic Heritage Ensemble but we also had the Spencer Jackson family, [HM] Darlene Blackburn used to dance, some of the Muntu players, we had the writers, we had plays right there on the beach, in that pavilion for two years.  And that was sort of money to quiet the activity--didn't want things to get out of hand so they gave us this money, YMCA.  That money came from the YMCA. And, I was asked to coordinate that program.  So that program, on weekends, four or five thousand people would be there.  It was just a great program.
Speaker 1: (unclear) on the lake.
Speaker 2: Yeah, great program.  We had large numbers of people coming out, listening to the music, dance.  We had workshops, any black tourist, when they came to Chicago, they wanted to come.  And, after two years, then Phil started Afro Arts Theater.  And, at the same time, Ted Ward started the Louis Theater, his theater on 35th Street.  ETA, I've been involved with ETA almost since its inception, as a board member, which I'm still on the board, you looking at thirty-four years.  I was very active with Kuumba.  You know, I started the Black Theater Alliance, which some people forgotten about but the Black Theater Alliance really don't--people don't realize the struggle that we had because black organizations were not getting funded by the Illinois Art Council, the Chicago Art Council, you got very little money.  So we had the League of Theaters wanted to control everything. A black--why you need a black theater alliance?  You got the League of Theaters. But you don't relate to us, you don't represent us so we had three or four years, really had to have a lot of confrontation with these agencies and--to see some of that money when to black artists.  (unclear) and not only that but some of us would serve on these committees to make decisions and of course [Chicago Mayor] Harold Washington Campaign, I chaired the Artists for Washington and, and that was a big responsibility 'cause we were not only organizing  black artists but also white artists and a lot of the Hispanic artists for about six months, that was just very active, the artists for--I think that we played a significant role, just in bringing the various groups together and we didn't raise much money but we performed gratis at a lot of events for the Harold Washington that--in homes and places where they had these little fundraisers.  Well, different performers would participate or Phil Cohran in particular and others so, I think that that was important that we had this coalition of artists and support for Harold Washington.
Story_ID: 77933
Speaker 1: Now, let me go back and ask you about your career as a social worker, as an author of books on social work and the social condition of black people, particularly youth, you know.  "Home Is A Dirty Street" was written in '74 [1974] or '75 [1975]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now what was it, was about the Lawndale Community?
Speaker 2: Yes, basically.
Speaker 1: What was it?
Speaker 2: Well, I think it was a microsco--of other black communities--I got that word out.
Speaker 1: Microcosm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  After working with young kids for a long time at Better Boys Foundation, I think we had some very positive programs but still a lot of our kids were getting in trouble, a lot of them were getting caught with the juvenile justice system.  And, I've always spent time out in the streets but I was becoming more conscious of the influence of the streets, that no matter how effective our programs were, as long as kids were learning other values that negated some of the things that we were teaching 'em, that certain behaviors would be manifested and that is when--I use the word "ghett-colony" to describe the community; ghetto and colony, 'cause I thought ghetto was not appropriate.  And my understanding is that it comes out of a Polish in Warsaw where Jews were segregated in the particular area, a ghetto.  And, in Chicago [Illinois], most ethnic groups would live in a ghetto, even today.  But when you talked about ghetto basically in the literature, you're talkin' 'bout impoverished black community.  It's a code word but it didn't describe it.  Colony, I thought, had more of a political meaning.  So a "ghett-colony" because the community is an oppressed community.  It's being controlled by people that do not actually live there and so I coined that term "ghett-colony."  And the street institution was the institution that had the greatest impact on a lot of kids in terms of their socialization and so "Home Is A Dirty Street" really talks about the street institution and how kids are being socialized and who's having the greatest impact on kids.  And what institutions are functioning and institutions that are not functioning, and what role models kids are coming in contact with, who's having the greatest impact on kids.  Many times, those of us that are social workers, school teachers, we feel that we are but it's not the case, you go out in the streets and the hustling and the pimp and the dope addict and the gang member may having the greatest influence on these kids.  And, so basically that's what "Home Is A Dirty Street" was about, kids growing up in Lawndale [Chicago, Illinois].  But, it's also representative of the communities because I found people from other communities, other cities, Cleveland [Ohio], you know, New York City [New York]--you know--it's the same thing, the kids act the same way.  It's the streets and even today, to a great extent, the street.  And it's an institution because it, it helps to shape values.  It has a set of mores, certain set of standards.  It has a process--and that's what institutions--and it also--of having instructors, and some of them, I have identified.  So, in that regard, I think a lot of people could relate.  And it was one of the first books really written about black children before--now you have a plethora of books about black children.  But '75 [1975] wasn't too many books written about black children before that other than the series of books that came out at the University of Chicago and I sort of identify those books and a few others, but not too many books written by blacks. I didn't use the terms endangered species, which became common, became a common lexicon after that.  And, the drugs were not as intense then so I don't belabor that--other than that, I think "Home Is A Dirty Street" is representative of a lot of what is taking place now, that's putting a lot of kids at jeopardy.  I do talk about the criminal justice system, that the juvenile system is an incubator for the adult system, and I was saying that in the 70s [1970s], '75 [1975].  So I think I was raising some issues and talking about some things that now are somewhat common place in the literature, but prior to 1975, there was not too much written from a sociological standpoint about the influences of kids growing up.  I think that's why "Home Is A Dirty Street", you know, has survived a period of time.  Third World Press recognizes that it's a book that has some interest.
Story_ID: 77934
Speaker 1: But as you know, I followed that up with "Harvesting New Generations" 'cause I wanted to--another whole positive thing.  Home ["Home Is A Dirty Street"] can be very depressing and then I wanted to take it to another level and I tried to do that in "Harvesting New Generations" to show that there are alternatives.  And, basically it's a model for rites of passage program.  And not many rites of passage programs had been published prior to that, although you did have some in existence but you didn't have a book basically talking about that in "Harvesting New Generations".  I think we're doing some re-writes.  We want that to come out again, hopefully.
Story_ID: 77935
Speaker 1: Sir, can you tell us about "The Black Child Journal"?
Speaker 2: Well, it's defunct now unfortunately.  At the time, again, it relates to my interest and I felt that we needed some publication that reflected what was happening to black children, a scholarly publication. So I took it upon myself to, to start the "The Black Child Journal", about ten, twelve years ago, I guess.  'Cause the first time, I think we had about five issues and then it stopped for a couple of years and then I tried to get it started again.  And, for some reason, it just--people liked it and I think it was a very good journal.  The second time I had on my board, Dr. Myesha Bennett.  I had Dr. Wilson, Chris Wilson, Dr. Wade Nobles, you know I sort of touched some of my, people that I knew to--thought it would enhance it and Dr. Asa Hilliard wrote some articles, so I had good articles--Dr. Na'im Akbar--I had good articles, but for some reason, it didn't, it didn't go over too well, over a long period.  Was paying for that mostly out of pocket.  I wasn't trying to make any money so was disappointed because I thought this was a publication that would--at least professional people--would support.  The price was very modest, five dollars. It was probably underpriced for (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Did you depend on subscriptions basically?
Speaker 2: Yes, and this is--you can only subscribe--survive with subscriptions.  I think I got up to about 100 at one time but you really needed like 500 or 1,000 'cause you just can't make it out of pocket.  You need to advance money.  I didn't have any ads, any paid ads and so just was just not able, wasn't financially feasible for me to maintain it.  Now, every now and then, I think about starting "Black Child Journal" again.  I'm surprised that no one has started a journal like that because there's not anything like it on the market today.  You got all these magazines and journals, a lot of popular magazines but they don't deal with the type of scholarly essays that I was publishing.  So sometimes I say well, maybe I could do it again.  I don't know, maybe I will.  It's a little hard to say.  But, I think that it was informative and I have copies of the ones that were published.  The second time, I had four issues 'cause it was coming out quarterly, so that--see the lifespan of the "Black Child Journal".
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 77936
Speaker 1: Now, tell me about some of your different career changes you've been through, different jobs you've had, and you've had some interesting jobs, here in Chicago [Illinois] and outside Chicago.
Speaker 2: Well, they really haven't been career changes.  They still in the human service profession.  The only--if you want to say for a brief time, I was an interim president of DuSable Museum [of African American History] but that was after I left Chicago and became president of the Urban League of Portland [Oregon].  But you talkin' about management abilities and a good manager can run just about any time of institution.  So I've stayed within my area of training, the human service, from Better Boys Foundation, I went to the Urban League, was the project, the program director at Chicago Urban League for about three years. And, that's when this job opened in Portland, Oregon, where I became the president.  I never thought of myself as being the president of a Urban League, not that it's such a big deal but Urban League, from my perspective, was always somewhat of a conservative institution and, and I just didn't think I would fit in.  But I did and I think that in Portland, I organized the Coalition of Black Men.  It still exists, that's one reason I had to leave, I think, 'cause--and organize the first black writer's workshop in the State of Oregon.  It still exists and I also started the Black Health Coalition and it still exists.  So those three organizations that I basically organized got started still exist in Portland, Oregon.  And, I think, I said tongue in cheek that maybe the Coalition of Black Men was responsible for me having an early departure 'cause I was only there for about three years because I organized the Coalition of Black Men on the assumption that we were going to be role models for black youth, that we were going to be positive males in the community, that we were going to address the drug problem, the gang problem, and I got a lot of publicity.  People said, oh, great, you know these black men are doing something positive and I had, oh about 100 men, literally about 100, marching down the streets, talkin' about we gonna shut down these drug houses.  I don't know if we actually shut 'em down but we did sort of slow down the business, no doubt about that.  And, so for about a year and a half after, you know, just great.  Then we start talkin' about jobs and, at that time, they were in process of building the convention center, that's where they play the basketball games now and the building trades.  No blacks were involved so we organized ourselves to shut down or close or demonstrate for jobs at the site that they were building this convention center and then things changed.  We were no longer, you know, really given any praise.  As long as we were dealing with these problems in the community and, you know, gangs and drugs was okay but we start talkin' about that black men needed jobs and that these construction companies needed to hire black men, these racist construction companies, everybody got all upset.  No, you not supposed to be doing that.  And, even some of my board members had told me that, well, the Urban League, you don't want to be upsetting the apple.  You know, you gettin' from corporate America in Portland, giving us money and we talkin' about them and jobs and everything like that.  And so that really led to, at some point, where I was resigned under pressure, you know how they do that, you know.  But I was ready to go at that point anyway 'cause I could have stayed there and fought.  I had a lot of community people who wanted to just say well Perkins we not gonna, you know, we not gonna let it happen here.  I said, no, I don't want people marching and, you know, saying Useni.  You know, that don't need to be done.  I can get me another job, you know, everything like that.  So, so I was there about three years, little less than three years, beautiful city and beautiful people.
Story_ID: 77937
Speaker 1: I like the area--when I came back to Chicago [Illinois], well, I had explained earlier about my involvement with the DuSable Museum [of African American History], ever since its inception and [HM] Margaret Burroughs being almost like a mother to me, extended family member.  They were having some problems at DuSable Museum.  They didn't have a president at the time and I knew from the get-go, it would just be an interim position for me and I was there for about a year and a half before they finally got someone to be a permanent person.  But, here again, I did have the background in cultural and art and so forth, that that was helpful.  And I wouldn't want to go into some other problems relating to the board.
Story_ID: 77938
Speaker 1: And then after that I did some consulting, which I've done off and on for a long time.  And I did some work at Comprend which was dealing with drug addicted mothers and young men that had been on drugs.
Speaker 2: This Comprend, this is a (unclear).
Speaker 1: Yes, right, yes.  So I worked there at 67th and Halsted for about three or four years, sort of part time 'cause I was also doing some consulting and Dr. Cross, who was [HM] Dolores Cross, president of Chicago State University came up with this initiative that the Office of Minority Health was funding HBCUs [Historically Black Colleges and Universities] to work with black males 'cause the whole concern about black males being in quote endangered species, the high death rates and homicide rates and so forth.  So she asked me would I want to come here, Chicago State to run that program.  I thought it was a good idea because it's something that's consistent with what I've always been doing over the years.  And it started in 1994, I just thought it be a three year program, here it is 2-0-3 [2003] and I'm in the process of developing another three year proposal so it's been nine years and the programs, the violence prevention program, we work primarily in the communities, at several schools, Ada S. McKinley and Abraham Lincoln Center, after school programs with curriculums that hopefully will diffuse some of the attitudes that fuels, you know, certain types of behavior.  Think this will be my last year 'cause I think I'm gonna start teaching more.  I been teaching--all the time, I've taught at several schools and universities, Valparaiso [University, Valparaiso, Indiana] and social work school, even Roosevelt University [Chicago, Illinois] at one time, here in Chicago State [University, Chicago, Illinois] years ago.  So--I've always--and then, I'm doing some teaching at the Center for Inner City Studies for the second time.  So I think that that I'll like to function, maybe exclusively on my creative side, maybe in M.F.A. program here in Chicago State University, in terms of play writing.  So, very optimistic about the future and--but I will be putting more time--remove one hat and probably just focus primarily on, on writing.
Story_ID: 77939
Speaker 1: Now, in the meantime, I think for the last, I don't know how long you (unclear), you're still doing it, but you were running marathons for a while.
Speaker 2: Only two, well two's enough at my age.  Yes, I'm--I got into this running after my basket--tennis, sort of went down (laughter).  And was very active in tennis and I don't want to use any names, mention any person, but when you start whipping me and I say I have to give up tennis and I start running, in 1986, a marathon there and a marathon in Portland.  I've run a lot of 5Ks and 8Ks and half marathons.  So, I still get out as often as I can and, at least try and run a couple of miles.  And, probably will run another half marathon.  I don't know if I'll ever try to do another marathon but, who knows.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 77940
Speaker 1: Sir, what are your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: We need to get hold of the schools.  The schools have to be held more accountable for our kids.  I just--we need to get the schools to be more accountable.  And, we need to divert kids from the criminal justice system.  I mean the criminal justice system is just swallowing up so many of our kids and now the fastest growing prison population are girls and women.  So it's not just the boys and men but it's girls being caught up in the criminal justice system.  We just have to somehow divert these kids from going into the criminal justice system--criminal justice system is sixty-four percent black nationally-sixty-four.  In Illinois, it's about seventy two percent.  The juvenile system as I've indicated is an incubator for the adult system so, what I would like to see in the black community, other than some economic development--but I still think education, as Malcolm X said, it's the passport to freedom but it has to be the right education.  The kids are not getting it.  Kids are dropping out school.  When you drop out of school, what do you have to do?  You gonna end up in the street institution.  You gonna end up with the self-destructive behavior--the schools.  I even--when you look at what's happening with the families, with sixty-two percent female headed homes, so a lot of that has to do with the schools, education.  A lot of these boys, these young men are fathering children with no responsibility of taking care of them.  That the education, that's how they see themselves, no understanding, that, that they affecting the lives of young people, that's education, that's values.  And that has to be taught early in life, during the formative years, during that whole--human development cycle.  And this is why the rites of passage programs have a lot of meaning, if you really implement rites of passage programs but most of these rites of passage programs are just by name.  They came 'em rites of passage, nursing school programs, three month program, rites of passage program is much more intense, it's over a longer period, it's more concentrated and that's not happening.  And so those are things we have to do.  We talk about who's having the greatest impact on the socialization of our young people and if it's the media, if it's other institutions, if it's mis-education, then we're losing and we're losing because of the lack of institutions that with a African center base that understands what young people need in terms of that whole development.  I think that's number one whose influencing and impacting our kids and we're having very little influence.  I would also mention churches need to be much more involved.  A lot of these preachers have to get away from the pulpit and get out in the streets.  All religions regardless of what religion one may embrace, I think a few churches are beginning to do that but it has to be a much more aggressive move to reach these kids.  Now, we don't give up on adults but chances of saving a lot of these adults are very slim, for some, slim as a blind jockey riding a one-legged horse to victory in the Kentucky Derby.  We better start with these kids, very early, preschool programs, models and so forth.  That's just a piece of it.

Speaker 1: Sir, at this point, in your life, what would you see as your legacy?
Speaker 2: I don't like to talk about legacies.  I really don't, you know, I interviewed this Yuri Lyubimov, Have trouble pronouncing that last name.  He's a Russian.  I introduced--I mean I interviewed him about eight years ago.  He's a famous director and I asked him the same questions 'cause it's a common question.  And he was talkin' 'bout, at some point in your life, when you make a departure, then people will add up the totals, you don't do the adding, other people will, let them decide.  And so I think the title of that interview was adding up the totals and I, I thought it was very meaningful.  It made a lot of sense to me.  I think other people, really, to a great extent, determine your legacy.  Everyone has a legacy, the drug addict, the wino, whoever, everybody, the homeless man, he has a legacy, and who defines that legacy.  I've always wanted to do good and hopefully some of the things that I've done have helped other people.  That sounds somewhat altruistic but I am altruistic.  I believe that there's light at the end of the tunnel regardless of how bleak things may be at any given time in our lives.  I been very fortunate to still be here at my age, to be functional and to be able to do some of the things that I have done and to come in contact with all the people that I have over the years and it's just truly been a blessing.  I can say that wholeheartedly and I just feel like the best is yet to come because I just feel that a lot of my energy, potential is still a work in progress.  And so that's how I see myself and so the legacy will speak for itself when you add up the totals.
