Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm the interviewer today for The HistoryMakers, our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Ma'am, could you please state your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Gail Adelle Hansberry [HistoryMaker Gail A. Hansberry], G-A-I-L, middle name is Adelle, A-D-E-L-L-E, last name Hansberry, H-A-N-S-B-E-R-R-Y.
Speaker 1: And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I was born September 4, 1939, which was Labor Day that year, here in Washington, D.C., at Freedmen's Hospital [Howard University Hospital].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Everybody--
Speaker 2: And the reason why I got the name Gail was I was born during the worst storm of the year, so that's how I got the name Gail (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, the fact is--
Speaker 2: Although it's spelled differently, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  People seem to be proud of Freedmen's Hospital, everybody we've interviewed has been, was born there except--
Speaker 2: Oh, well, it was the only hospital, (laughter) I guess, for people of color many years ago.  So anybody, or most people in Washington, or a large number were born at Freedmen's Hospital, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm contracted by the U.S. Department of State as an English language officer.  And I travel with international visitors who are invited by the American embassies abroad, they're invited by the American embassies abroad to visit the United States and to meet their counterparts here.  And these people are emerging leaders in their countries so they come to become familiar with the United States and to meet their counterparts.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And I've heard that you're also a photographer, right?
Speaker 2: Well, yes, I used to be (laughter) a photographer, tried my hand at being a freelance photographer when I was in New York [New York].  And I was also a graphic artist when I was in New York.  And a bookmaker, meaning I made books by hand, made a few books by hand.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I was in New York primarily.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is February 9th, 19--oh, 2007.
Speaker 1: And where are we (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Friday.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm sorry, where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're at the Howard University library, the museum in the Howard University Library.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: In Washington, D.C.
Story_ID: 482399
Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five lightweight People magazine-ish type questions that I'm compelled by management to ask and they only require a short answer.  The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Purple, maybe.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Spring and fall.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: No, because I travel so much for my job, my job is traveling so a vacation is almost staying here at home (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last question is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Hm, well, recently, one should be consistent and fair in their relationships with people.
Story_ID: 482400
Speaker 1: Now I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [William Leo Hansberry] side, but we'll start with your mother's side, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Myrtle, M-Y-R-T-L-E, Bliss, was her middle name, B-L-I-S-S, K-E-L-S-O, was her last name, Myrtle Bliss Kelso [Myrtle Kelso Hansberry].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born September 24, 1907, I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In Meridian, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  In Meridian, Mississippi.  Now what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far can you trace the ancestors on that side?
Speaker 2: I can't trace them back very far.  When I was doing research about my father's family I realized I didn't know terribly much about my mother's family.  So I did go to Meridian, and found a few relatives there on my mother's side but it doesn't go further back than my great-grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--
Speaker 2: Who was Watt Kelso [ph.]?
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now was he, did, did he have a memory of slavery or, or--
Speaker 2: I don't know, I didn't know my great-grandfather.  I, his son, my grandfather, my mother's father was Wiley P. Kelso [Wiley Kelso] and I really didn't know him because he was, he died about three years after I was born, he died in 1942.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were there any stories handed down on that side of the family about what life was like in--
Speaker 2: Didn't hear very much about my mother's side of the family.  My mother was taken to Chicago [Illinois], when the whole family went to Chicago when she was five years old.  So in essence, she grew up in Chicago and that's basically what I heard about growing up--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in Chicago.
Speaker 1: So the whole family moved to Chicago.  Is there a story about why they, they, they all moved to Chicago?
Speaker 2: I never knew a particular story about that.  I guess, it was a part of the migration from the South, particularly, Mississippi up to Chicago.  From what I understand you find as many people (laughter) or many black people in Chicago who are from Mississippi than from other places so they might have been a part of that migration around the early teens [1910s], in the 1900s, what, she was, 1912, 1913, something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But my grandfather I understand did have a restaurant in Chicago and he was very much interested in, in issues that pertained to African Americans.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was he a member of any organizations that were--
Speaker 2: I don't know, I really don't know.  Not very much was mentioned about him.
Speaker 1: Did you, do you have any idea where his restaurant was?
Speaker 2: No, I don't (laughter).  I, I, I understand that it was a successful restaurant and, you know, they lived fairly comfortably but as far as the details are concerned I just don't know, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Do you know the name of it?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.  So, I just wondered, were, were they, was he restaurateur or a cook in Mississippi or--?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I really don't know that much about my mother's side of the family and I, I realize those are questions, if I can get in touch with the cousins in Meridian, these are questions that I really need to find out.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  The fact that he had a restaurant kind of indicates that he was doing something like that there, you know, too.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And it probably was not far, I mean, like, well, most of the people that came up during the Great Migration were farming, you know they were you know, tenant farmers and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was not, not so many owned property and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --had, you know--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --so I just wondered what, if there might be a story, and there probably is but, you know, (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There probably is a story, yes--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --it's just a matter of finding out exactly--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --what.
Speaker 1: Now, so did your, did you, did you know your grandfather?
Speaker 2: I can remember just being with him a few times because again I was only two years old (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear) yeah.
Speaker 2: --when he died.  He died in 1942, I was born in September of '39 [1939], so I may have been almost three years old--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --when he died.
Speaker 1: Did you--
Speaker 2: But I do have a couple of pictures of me with him.
Story_ID: 482401
Speaker 1: Do you remember your maternal grandmother [Mamie Kelso]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yes, I remember her very well.  And I'm about to sneeze (laughter).  She lived with us for a long time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did she, did, did she have a profession or was, did she, basically in those days a housewife or, or--
Speaker 2: She lived in Chicago [Illinois] and then when I was born, shortly after I was born she moved here to Washington [D.C.].  And she worked in the government for a number of years.  I don't know in what capacity.  But she lived, lived either in our house with us or she had her own apartment for a while and then she moved back into the family house with us.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now your mother [Myrtle Kelso Hansberry] she was born in Meridian [Mississippi], the family moved to Chicago--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --did she finish school in Chicago?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She went to the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  And she said she was the first black person in the choir at the University of Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know what high school she went to?
Speaker 2: I'm wondering if it was Hyde Park High School [Hyde Park Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].  I'm not sure but that kind of rings a bell.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So what was her major in college?
Speaker 2: French.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  So she majored in French, it came in handy when we were traveling in Europe and in Africa some time so and it was very helpful to my father when he was doing his research.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did she, now did, how did she wind up in, in D.C.? Did she--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) She married my father [William Leo Hansberry].
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Apparently, they met in Chicago.  He was doing, doing research at the University of Chicago Oriental Institute [Chicago, Illinois] and they met there.  Also, my father's family moved from Mississippi to Chicago as well.  So both families actually lived in Chicago on the South Side as I understand it.  And my mother and father met in the, around 1936, '37 [1937].  They got married in '37 [1937], so I guess they met in '36 [1936] or so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Married in '37 [1937] and I was born in '39 [1939], um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now what was your mother?  Oh, she was, she was a French major, all right.  And she had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She was a French major.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But she worked as a social worker--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in Chicago, um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And my grandmother, I guess, was a housewife.
Story_ID: 482402
Speaker 1: Let me go to your father's side of the family.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: William Leo Hansberry, W-I-L-L-I-A-M, L-E-O, H-A-N-S-B-E-R-R-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born February 25, 1894.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where was he born?
Speaker 2: Oh, Gloster, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And now well, what do you know about his side of the family?  How far back can you trace them and what did they do?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, I guess we were trying to, I know more about my father's side of the family.  We were trying to trace them back as far as we could go.  There were two stories that my father used to, or one story that my father used to tell us that we were descended from Peter Hansberry [ph.] from Scotland and I just sort of took that with a grain of salt (laughter).  And then when we became interested, my sister [Kay Hansberry] and I became interested in actually doing more research about the family history, we started delving more into where the name came from, who were our ancestors.  And with the help of the family griot in, in Baton Rouge [Louisiana] Alton Kelly [ph.], we have done a lot of research about, about the name Hansberry and, and how the relatives, my grandfather, great-grandfather, great-great-grandfather ended up in, in, in Louisiana.  Alton Kelly said that a Mr. Hansberry, William Hansberry, and in some research, I find that it was possible that a William Hansberg [ph.] or Hansberger [ph.] from Germany came over to Culpeper County in Virginia and had two children by a slave woman.  And these two sons were sold into slavery into Louisiana, at least this is the, the story that I have heard.  And we're only familiar with one of those sons, William Hansberry.  And he was a very proud man and he was a brick maker in Louisiana, in around the Clinton [Louisiana] area which is not far from Baton Rouge.  And he used to ride on a big stallion and so on.  And William Hansberry had ten children and one of those children was Elden Hansberry.  And Elden turned out to be from what I understand a professor of history at Alcorn College [Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College], which I guess is now Alcorn State University in Mississippi [Lorman, Mississippi].
Speaker 1: So that would be your grandfather, right?
Speaker 2: My grandfather, right.
Speaker 1: Elden Hansberry.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Elden Hayes Hansberry.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And he taught at Alcorn College--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in, Alcorn, Mississippi?
Speaker 2: I think, at least the train stop was Lorman, Mississippi, (laughter) not too far from Natchez [Mississippi].  Everything down there is, I'm finding out, fairly, fair, fairly close to one another.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so your, your father basically grew up in, on the campus of Alcorn?
Speaker 2: Well, he went to Alcorn in high school.  I think there was a high school connected with the college and then he started school there.  There is written information about where he went to school and how he went to school.  And Alcorn is about, I don't know, maybe, fifty miles, sixty miles from Gloster.  So from what I'm piecing together his father probably taught at Alcorn whereas the family lived in Gloster, Mississippi.  And but he was always, my father was always interested in learning, he was interested in book learning, he wasn't interested in agriculture or anything like that.  And so he sort of took after his father who taught for a short time in, at Alcorn.  But from what I understand he died when my father was about three or four years old.  And so his, his interest was always in books but he, he didn't know my, my father didn't know his father for a long period of time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The seed had been planted, you might say.
Speaker 1: So, so he really didn't grow up on the campus or amongst (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 482403
Speaker 1: But there really, there is information that has been written about my father in a dissertation on him, 'A Prophet Without Honor' ['A Prophet Without Honor: William Leo Hansberry and the Origins of the Discipline of African Studies (1894-1939)'], and it was written in 1998 by Kwame Wes Alford who got his dissertation at the University of Missouri or got his Ph.D. I should say, at the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri.
Speaker 2: That's by, what, what's his name again, I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: Kwame.
Speaker 2: Kwame.
Speaker 1: K-W-A-M-E, Wes, W-E-S, A-L-F-O-R-D.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, many of us in my generation, anyway, I'm, I'm fifty-seven now but we found out about William Leo Hansberry from Joseph Harris' [Joseph E. Harris] books, and we, we had no idea there was some, there was someone like him.  He was a unique person in the study of black history because he was one of the first Africanists--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --as such.  Or probably was the Africanist in a professional situation.  So what are, what, what are some of your memories of your father?
Speaker 1: Well, I guess, some of the first memories, the, were I remember him lecturing to me about Africa.  He would, I would be sitting on the piano bench in the library at our first home that I remember in the Brookland section of, of Washington [D.C.].  And it was almost as if I was a student of his, I would sit there and listen and he would lecture to me about the, the glories of the African past.  And I don't know exactly how old I was, maybe five years old, six years old or so, so that's one of the first memories that I have about, about my father.  I, when I was old enough to, to, to really be conscious of it, I asked what it was he did, and well what field was he in and I was told archeology, anthropology, and history, ancient African history.  So I grew up knowing about the, the glories of Africa, the fact that man originated in Africa, that Africa had a glorious past, had kings and queens when Europe was in the Dark Ages.  So I always knew that that we should be proud of our heritage and that much of what Europe learned came from Africa.  So I realized as I was growing up by, (laughter) was fairly unique because everybody didn't know that, most people did not know that.  But he started teaching here at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] 1922, 1923--
Speaker 2: Now--
Speaker 1: --until his retirement in 1959, '60 [1960].
Speaker 2: Okay--
Story_ID: 482404
Speaker 1: Okay, well let's go back a little and just, 'cause I, well I, I just realized I had skipped where he [Hansberry's father, William Leo Hansberry] went to college and he, you say he graduated from Alcorn's [Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College; Alcorn State University, Lorman, Mississippi] high school?
Speaker 2: Well he went to Alcorn high school, he probably started college at Alcorn but he also went to a college in Tennessee, I believe it was Nashville, and then to old Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  And he became aware of W.E.B. Du Bois' book 'The Negro' and he realized that there was a reading list there and he could not gain access to some of these books that were on the reading list so what he did was he went to Harvard [Harvard University] in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to get access to the books that were in the reading list in W.E.B. Du Bois' book 'The Negro'.  And it was only at this time that he could really delve into the history of black people, the history of Africans, what was the history of Africa, and so this was the journey that took him up to Harvard.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he pursued a master's degree at Harvard, correct?
Speaker 2: He, he, he got an undergraduate degree at Harvard in 1921 and then he taught at Straight College [New Orleans, Louisiana] right after finishing Harvard in 1921, '22 [1922], and then he started here at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] in the history department around 1923, I believe, '22 [1922], '23 [1923].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: At some point he, didn't he achieve a master's at Harvard?
Speaker 2: Oh, he went back to Harvard and got a master's degree in 1932.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And from what I heard they could, he wanted to, you know, work on a Ph.D. but they only, in the field he was in, there wasn't anybody that could teach him anything beyond what--
Speaker 2: Well that's, yeah, that's the, the way the story goes that he was really preeminent in his field and there was no one who could or who know, knew more than he did eventually about, about ancient African history.  Also he, he went to Oxford University [University of Oxford, Oxford, England] in England with the idea as I read of getting a Ph.D. but again it, it didn't happen.  So he really was the preeminent person in ancient African history.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, his testimony in that and, and Harris' [Joseph E. Harris] book and I'm sure in the dissertation by, you know.  So here he is, he's the, what I also had read that he was, that his class was, was really popular at Howard.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, though every year he had to struggle to (laughter) make sure he had a class.  I mean, the university wanted to cancel his class every year.
Speaker 2: From what I understand, 'cause all this happened before I was born, he was very popular, he was a very good teacher, he was presenting something that was very unique for the time, he realized that most people didn't want to know anything about Africa or they thought that Africa had no past because, you know, Africans were presented as savages or people who really had no history or culture.  So he was sort of swimming upstream and he wanted to make this information known to the general public and he would travel around giving lectures at various universities during the '20s [1920s] and '30 [1930s].  And as you said, his classes here at Howard were very popular, he would as many as eight hundred people or so as I understand it in a class and he would have people keep notebooks, little blue notebooks.
Story_ID: 482405
Speaker 1: From my understanding, many of the people who went into the field of Africa, African history, any, had any connection with Africa, were influenced by my father.
Speaker 2: Right.  I know I've heard stories from John Henrik Clarke, that as a teenager he would, and later he attended lectures of William Leo Hansberry in Harlem [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] William Greaves, I think, the filmmaker talks about attending--
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: --lectures.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: So there, it's, sort, lots of people, you know, talk about it.  And just to maybe, just to close out his career story, I know he, from what I, correct, correct, me if I'm wrong on any of this, but from what I read, he strove to establish an African studies department here at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] and the idea was rejected by a committee that included E. Franklin Frazier and some others.
Speaker 1: Well, that may be true.  There were people who for some reason or other did not want him to succeed for whatever reason, whether it was academic jealousy.  He did not have a Ph.D. so I don't know whether that was one of the issues, here was somebody who was very popular, teaching about a subject that not many people knew about, not many people wanted to know about and he didn't have a Ph.D.  And yes from what I understand he was not a part of the African studies department or project here at Howard in the late '50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: Yeah, well--
Speaker 1: In the establishment of that.
Speaker 2: I think the story goes that he was at the university of, well he was in Nigeria, where they had named a library after him on a sabbatical, I mean, or he had, he had retired and was there--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --when he found out that a department was established with E. Franklin Frazier as the head of it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh (laughter).  Well, I know--
Speaker 2: (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) that the University of Nigeria [University of Nigeria Nsukka, Nsukka, Nigeria], established a institute, the Hansberry Institute of African Studies [Institute of African Studies] at one of the campuses in Nsukka [Nigeria].  And the head of Nigeria, the president of Nigeria, Dr. Azikiwe [Nnamdi Azikiwe], had been a student of my father's here at Howard and had influenced him or at least Azikiwe became more aware of again the, the African roots, the, the, the history of Africa.  And so he did ask my father to come over for the inaugural ceremony of the University of Nigeria in general and also my father as you said the, the, the school of--or Institute of African Studies was named after him, for him at the university located in Nsukka.
Story_ID: 482406
Speaker 1: So we were talking about your father [William Leo Hansberry] and some of his struggles in academia and his great contributions.  There was a, I know there was another highlight of his life was a trip to, well, he was trying to become part of an expedition that all the American Egyptologists were making to Nubia and he was, he was rejected finally but the, the person that had to send him the letter was Dows Dunham from the Boston museum [Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: They sent him a letter saying that he regrets he couldn't take him but the other, some of the other members thinks that having a Negro on the expedition would--would reduce the dignity of it or something.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And, you know, which is just really crazy 'cause he was the--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --he knew more than anybody else.  And Dows Dunham indicated--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --that in the letter.  But do you, were you aware of the Africa House [Washington, D.C.] he founded when he (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was aware of Africa House.  Well, I don't know terribly much about it other than the fact that my father was, was one of the founders of Africa House and he was, you know, intricately involved with it and it was downtown on T Street, I believe.  But my father was the advisor to African students here at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  And there weren't many students at Howard, this was in the '40s [1940s] and, and '50s [1950s].  But I grew up knowing Nigerians primarily and some Ethiopians.  So we always had Nigerians at the house.  Some of the students helped my father with his research or with the, they did secretarial work for my father.  And so there were, there was no sort of coordinated effort to advise them so my father became the, I don't know if he was totally unofficial or unofficial, official advisor to African students and there were lots of students in our house.  And most of the students that I knew growing up were brilliant, brilliant students.  I guess, to get over here at that time you had to have something on the ball.
Speaker 1: Well, one example you gave was Nnamdi Azikiwe who becomes--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --the president of Nigeria.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: He's, but--
Speaker 2: But he, he was here just at Howard for a short time but he eventually graduated from Lincoln University in Pennsylvania [Lincoln University, Pennsylvania].  I think there was some connection between Nkrumah [Kwame Nkrumah] and my father.  But most of the, well, yeah, the, the, the students really had to have something on the ball.  And I grew up knowing Nigerians and I grew up knowing Ethiopians.
Story_ID: 482407
Speaker 1: Did you get any idea from your father [William Leo Hansberry] where he, he developed the interest in Africa which was so unusual in those days, 'cause there were, there weren't that many people interested in Africa?
Speaker 2: You know, I was just reading some information about that very recently.  As I said earlier probably from, from his father [Elden Hayes Hansberry] but then also he read 'The Negro' by W.E.B. Du Bois and much of what he read in there sort of gave him a sense of confidence or the fact that he knew that there, that there was a world out there that, I guess, he was questioning, how could black people not have a history?  How could they be brought from Africa and then not have a past or a history?  And this was something that just kind of gnawed at him, I guess.  And the seeds had been planted because of his father being a historian, or a history teacher at Alcorn [Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College; Alcorn State University, Lorman, Mississippi].  And so he just pursued this passion, I mean, he was passionate about Africa.  He would provide information to anybody who would ask him.  So many of the people, journalists, other historians, colleagues here at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] and elsewhere, would ask him about certain things, what he was doing, what was taking place in Africa, or what had taken place in Africa.  And many of them got recognition before my father got recognition.  So but he, he was such a generous person and so passionate about what he, what he was interested in that he wanted.  He transmitted this passion; he was, he, he would just give the information out freely.  And I guess that's one of the things that you do when you're a teacher.  He used to say, "If the student hasn't learned, the teacher hasn't taught."  And he was such an excellent teacher and the, his, his excitement, you know, sort was transferred to the students and they were excited also, I guess, that's what made him a very popular teacher.  In addition, to the fact that they were learning about something that was very unusual for them and it sort of opened their eyes and it broadened their perspective not just to what had happened here in the United States but, you know, worldwide and particularly focusing on Africa.  And they were not from the Dark Continent that they thought they were from or that wasn't their legacy but from a people that were kings and queens, and then when you stop to think that man originated in Africa then, you know, it was the most, it was the continent with the most favorable conditions for man to be created, you know, from the standpoint of, of archeology and anthropology.  And what I was reading recently was that many of these things that my father was teaching or saying back in the '20s [1920s] and '30s [1930s] and '40s [1940s] have been actually proven, you know, more accepted now because of the, the research and the, the archeological digs in East Africa.

Speaker 1: Can you describe your mother's [Myrtle Kelso Hansberry] personality for us?
Speaker 2: She was a very nice person, very helpful person, a very calm person.  I guess, you could say I grew up in a calm household.  My father [William Leo Hansberry] was a very gentle man and I guess that's where you get gentleman from but he was a very giving person, a very accepting person.  My, my mother was also a very nice person, a giving person, and just, you know, I keep saying nice, it sounds like such a trite word but a very caring person and a very bright person, so they made a good team.  She, she would help my father in the, do, in the typing of some of his manuscripts and if something needed to be translated that was in French she would help him translate the items.
Speaker 1: How many languages did, did your father speak?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) He wasn't really a linguist.  I think German was the, the, the language that he took in college but my mother was more of the linguist.  He had to take languages because they were required.
Story_ID: 482409
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I remember playing in the backyard of the house [in Washington, D.C.].  I must have been about two and I had a, a toy iron that actually plugged in (laughter).  And that seems to be my earliest childhood memory playing in the backyard and playing with this toy, toy iron.
Speaker 1: Now that, just on the surface it sounds so dangerous, a toy iron that actually plugged in the wall and--
Speaker 2: It seems to me that it did and I, it would get warm and I, I remembered putting it to my cheek.  And I don't know, I don't know, you know, if I imagined this but that seems to be the one thing, the first thing that I remembered was playing with this toy iron and it plugged in.  And nobody is around now who can verify that (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 482410
Speaker 1: You have siblings too, right?
Speaker 2: I have a sister.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you have sister, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And she's how, how many, she's, she's younger than you, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she's seven and a half, eight years younger than I.  There was another daughter that my parents [Myrtle Kelso Hansberry and William Leo Hansberry] had who was three years younger than I and she died suddenly when I was six, I think I was six, she was three.  And then my sister, Kay [Kay Hansberry], was born several months after that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I was seven and a half.
Story_ID: 482411
Speaker 1: Did you grow up around the Howard campus [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] here, in this neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Howard was my first home.  When I was taken from Freedmen's Hospital [Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.] my parents [Myrtle Kelso Hansberry and William Leo Hansberry] were living at Miner Hall, old Miner Hall which was just across the street.  They tore Miner Hall down and built what was the School of Human Ecology.  And now I understand the school is no longer there.  I guess the building is there but it's used as a, as a school.  So yes, I always think of my first home as being Howard University and I have photographs of me when I was two years old on the, on the campus.  I don't think I, I lived here for very long, however, because after we lived at Miner Hall when I was an infant the family moved to Alabama Avenue and then my first recollection though is living in Brookland [Washington, D.C.] on Hamlin Street and we moved there when I was two.  And that house had a big backyard and a fairly good size front yard but it had a really big back yard so I remember, you know, playing in the backyard and so on.
Story_ID: 482412
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights, and sounds, and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Sights, sounds, smells.  I was just gonna describe the backyard and the wisteria vine on the front porch.  I remember my parents [Myrtle Kelso Hansberry and William Leo Hansberry] would sit on the front porch either in a rocking chair or, you know, just chairs on the porch.  And I just always enjoyed the wisteria vine because I liked the color of the, of the flowers.  They were fragrant, but they also attracted, attracted lots of bees (laughter) as I recall.  In the backyard, there was a large magnolia bush and I used to play house in, in the backyard under the magnolia bush.  They had slatted lawn chairs and I would turn the chair over, put a blanket, and play house.  But I always enjoyed playing under the big magnolia tree with the big white blossoms.  And it was a very quiet neighborhood [Brookland, Washington, D.C.] so there weren't many sounds from the street so to speak, but a very quiet and stable neighborhood.
Story_ID: 482413
Speaker 1: When you were growing up what, what sorts of things did you like to do?  I mean, did you like to do in the neighborhood [Brookland, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Well, when I was about, I don't know ten, eleven, twelve, I became interested in astronomy and I don't know where that interest came from but my father [William Leo Hansberry] and I would go out and take star trails, you know, you would have a camera that you could open the shutter and you would set it on a tripod and just leave it open and you would get the, the circular motion of the stars and so I used to do that.  I found out that astronomy was more than just taking star trails, (laughter) it was a lot of math, so that was the end of my career so to speak as an astronomer.  I used to like to draw.  And I guess that was the background for my majoring in art here at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] when--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --I was student here.
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this.  I know I've read that your father had slides of African history he would show and that sort of thing and was, was he into photography at all, himself?
Speaker 2: No, no, no--
Speaker 1: How did--
Speaker 2: --these were slides, lantern slides that he had made for his students for his classes but he was not into photography as such.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So these--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --are slides that you would make, that would be like analogous to overhead slides for nowadays or something?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: But you had the long projector, I guess, with the bellows on it and a thing and you put the slide in and slide it through (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, well you all would go out, actually go out with a camera on a tripod and make these star trails?
Speaker 2: Yes, at night.  And as I said I don't know how I became interested in, in astronomy whether I read a book or I just don't know but star trails was, was the main thing that I did.  And so but you're talking about now say from the age of seven to twelve or maybe even thirteen.
Story_ID: 482414
Speaker 1: When I was fourteen, I went to Egypt so that was sort of a dividing line or a watershed time in my life.  Also, I was very interested in football.  And I, again, that may have been when I was around twelve I wanted to be a football player.  And didn't know terribly much about football, the rules of the game but I liked to watch the game and I knew the fundamentals, the basics of football.  And during my college or later teen years I would sit and listen to college games on the radio on Saturday afternoon.  And then as time went on I became more interested in the professional games and for many years my sister [Kay Hansberry] and I would watch the games on, usually on Sunday afternoon, the professional games.  So I've always had an interest in football and again I don't know where that came from (laughter).  I thought maybe running, being a tackle, you know, running down the field tackling somebody was lots of fun.  But I found out soon that football was more than just tackling somebody (laughter) and running down the field.  But I remember maybe when I came back from Egypt just running and leaping in the backyard, the backyard was fairly deep so I enjoyed running and taking a leap and watching the clouds in the sky.  In those days, you know, the sky was blue and you had white clouds.  And so I was always very interested in nature from that standpoint and there was a sense of freedom, you know, of just being free, being in nature, playing house.  I remember we used to listen to Liberace also, Sunday evenings, I believe, or, you know, sitting on the front porch near the wisteria vines.  And also growing up we would play card games, I remember.  I wasn't very much of a card player but, you know, family type games. Pit, I think one was named Pit or you go, pit, pit, pit or (laughter) something, I don't remember the name of the game but sometimes we would do that, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now in term--in terms of football then you must have seen a lot of the Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] football games I suppose then, right?
Speaker 1: You mean here when I was--
Speaker 2: Live, yeah, yeah, 'cause football--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --wasn't on, was, well when, I get, well, I guess when you were older you had, you had television but did you, did, did you become interested in football from live games or from, from--
Speaker 1: More from radio.
Speaker 2: Radio.
Speaker 1: This was when I was, before I came, now, I'm trying to think, oh, dear, 'cause I returned to, I was in Egypt, we left Egypt, left Washington [D.C.] to go to Egypt when I was thirteen, arrived when I was fourteen, came back to the United States just before I was fifteen, so I guess listening to those games on Sunday afternoon or Saturday afternoon would be save while I was in college, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, well, I, I entered Howard when I was seventeen.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But I didn't go to many live games.  I was much more interested for some reason in listening to the games.
Story_ID: 482415
Speaker 1: Well tell us about, now where did you start school?
Speaker 2: Here in Washington [D.C.]?  I started at Mott School [Lucretia Mott Elementary School, Washington, D.C.].  I went to kindergarten there.
Speaker 1: Is that M--
Speaker 2: M-O-T-T (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: [Simultaneous] O-T-T.
Speaker 2: Which is just around the corner here, or at least it used to be around the corner, I don't know if the school is still there.  But I didn't stay in kindergarten but for about eight weeks, I was skipped to first grade.  And so I spent most of my elementary school years at Slowe School [Slowe Elementary School] in Washington, S-L-O-W-E.  Probably named for Lucy Diggs Slowe.
Speaker 1: Right.  Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: And that was in Brookland [Washington, D.C.] about three, four blocks from where we lived in Brookland.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were at Mott for your, part of your--
Speaker 2: For--
Speaker 1: --kindergarten year (unclear) [simultaneous]?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous Yeah, just a few weeks of kindergarten and then I went to Slowe.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you go there through eighth grade or--
Speaker 2: Sixth grade.
Speaker 1: Sixth grade, all right.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And then elementary school in those days was up to sixth grade, then junior high school was at Banneker Junior High [Benjamin Banneker Junior High School; Benjamin Banneker Academic High School, Washington, D.C.] on Georgia Avenue, and that was seventh, eighth, ninth grade.  And then I would have gone to Dunbar High School [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School, Washington, D.C.] where all the black students went but that year we went to Cairo, Egypt, so I did not go to Dunbar.  My tenth grade was spent in Cairo at Manor House English school [Manor House School].  And when I came back to Washington the following year, school integration had started and I went to McKinley High School [McKinley Technical High School; McKinley Technology High School, Washington, D.C.], I was in the first class of black students at McKinley High School--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in 1954.
Story_ID: 482416
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: Hm, I don't think I did, I was just interested in just about everything.  I remember here at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] we had to take core courses, we had to take a humanities course and I was just interested in everything that they taught in that humanities course.  I wasn't very good in science as such but I liked the concept of things whether they were in chemistry or physics.  I didn't like biology very well and I wasn't terribly good in math, I didn't think, but the humanities I liked and some of the concepts in the sciences I liked but I didn't have one favorite subject.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I would, I, well I know art must have been some sort of a favorite I guess, right, because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, yeah, I would draw on my own and I did major in art here at Howard.  I had some, well the department, art department, was fairly small at the time but with very significant teachers.  Lois Jones [Lois Mailou Jones] was a teacher, James Porter [James A. Porter] was a teacher, and Lesesne Wells [James Lesesne Wells] was a teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But that's late, that's at, at Howard here.
Speaker 2: At Howard--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now when you were in grade school, did, did, were there any special teachers that that you remember that you, with, that took a special interest in you?
Speaker 2: Hmm.  I don't remember any, I'm, I remember the teachers, Mrs. Burke [ph.], Miss Hethcock [ph.], Mrs. Carson [ph.] but, you know, it was just kind of a normal grade school experience, nothing within my grade school experience stands out as momentous (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.  What about junior high school?  Were there any teachers there that stand out?
Speaker 2: Mrs. Bell [ph.] she was my homeroom teacher.  Mrs. Snowden was my art teacher.  It was very interesting about working with Mrs. Snowden because when I taught school many years later it turned out Mrs. Snowden was teaching art in the junior high school where I was teaching art, we were colleagues.  And then also they lived around the corner from us in Washington [D.C.] so I would, you know, they were family friends and I would play with her daughter.
Speaker 1: Was she related Frank Snowden [Frank M. Snowden, Jr.] the--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --classicist?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: All right.  That's, he's an important, you know, ancient history figure too, well, you know, historian to, well, in the--
Speaker 2: Yes, his focus was Greece and Rome.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah, that's interesting I thought, I thought to ask, I said well maybe not but I'm glad I asked.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Dr. Snowden would, my father didn't drive, I don't know why he didn't drive.  He was a very witty person I always said but my mother [Myrtle Kelso Hansberry] would say, "Leo [William Leo Hansberry], everybody, any nitwit knows how to drive," and he said, "Well, I'm no nitwit" (laughter).  So he never did learn how to drive.  So if he got from one place to the other somebody drove him and it was my mother or sometimes Dr. Snowden when they were coming up to Howard.  My father would ride along with Dr. Snowden and they had lots of conversations in the car.
Speaker 1: I can imagine, I would love to be a little fly on the, on the dashboard--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, for those conversations.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 482417
Speaker 1: Do you remember, did your, did, did you ever visit your cousin?  Now, now your cousin is, is Lorraine Hansberry, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did, did, that's your father's brother's daughter?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And they lived in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And she, of course, became a great playwright.  Did--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --did she ever come down to visit or did you go up to visit them?
Speaker 2: Not that often.  She was the youngest of four children.  And I knew her older sister, Mamie [Mamie Hansberry] better than I knew Lorraine.  Mamie actually came to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] so there was oh, I don't know when she was at Howard I was still a young child but I saw more of Mamie than I did Lorraine.  When Lorraine became well known then I did see her in New York [New York] on several occasions but I was more aware of, of her sister--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Mamie, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: And still in, you know, she lives in Los Angeles [California] now and we're still in touch out there, Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I know when I saw 'A Raisin in the Sun' [Lorraine Hansberry], I thought, when I saw it, I guess, as an adult when I knew about William Leo Hansberry, I wondered if Lorraine Hansberry's play 'Raisin in the Sun' was influenced by the work of William Leo Hansberry because, of course, one of the, I, I think it's Beneatha [Beneatha Younger], I think the character--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --is going with an African student.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, you know, it's an interesting interaction.  I, I wondered if that, there was some connection.
Speaker 2: I think there was some connection.  My father would go to Chicago frequently and he and, and his brother would, you know, were in touch.  And I think Lorraine must have been influenced by what my father was doing and, you know, it was natural.  My father would probably talk to his family about Africa and so, you know, I, I would automatically think that she was influenced by the work that he was doing.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it does seem like--
Speaker 2: And to have it in, in having a Nigerian student in the play.
Speaker 1: Right, right, it does seem like that part of the play is dedicated to an--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --African awareness.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And also from what I understand my father's brother, his name was Carl [Carl Augustus Hansberry], was also a race man, he was a businessman, he was in real estate, I think at that time he was a Republican because many black people were Republicans because Lincoln [President Abraham Lincoln] had freed the slaves and he was a Republican.  But he was very much a, a person about his heritage and his histories, so both of the brothers were interested in their, in the knowledge of their heritage.
Story_ID: 482418
Speaker 1: Were your father [William Leo Hansberry] and your uncle [Carl Augustus Hansberry] a part of any organizations that--
Speaker 2: Hm.  Well my father was a part of several organizations here in Washington [D.C.].  I don't know about my uncle in Chicago [Illinois], again, he died when I was fairly small, he died very young.  He actually was in Mexico and he died in Mexico.  So I didn't know him very well.  But my father was a founder of Africa House [Washington, D.C.] as you mentioned.  He was a founder of the African American Institute which is now the Africa-America Institute in New York [Africa-American Institute; The Africa-America Institute, New York, New York].  And it provided a lot of help and scholarships for African students and started in the 1950s.  My father was also a member of the Ethiopian Research Council and which was active when Ethiopia was being, I don't know if I should say attacked but, but was--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --colonized by Italy.
Speaker 1: It was being attacked (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: In 1936.
Speaker 2: Yes.  So I'm sure that there were other organizations that he was interested in and a part of, a founding member of (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, okay.  I just wondered, yeah, I just wondered if he was, you know, a member of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] or the UNIA [Universal Negro Improvement Association], you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, oh, oh, I see, those types of--
Speaker 1: 'Cause I mean with that, the, the interest in Africa I wondered if he was formally associated in any way with the UNIA, you know.
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I did read something that that mentioned Marcus Garvey, and I don't know if there was actual contact with it, between the two.  It's possible that there could have been.  He was an Alpha, Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity man.  And but he was actually so involved in Africa, helping the students, having his own family.
Story_ID: 482419
Speaker 1: And then his [Hansberry's father, William Leo Hansberry] sister lived in Washington [D.C.] and her husband was also a professor here at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], Dr. E. Horace Fitchett [E. Horace Fitchett, Sr.] in sociology.  And he--
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, what was her name this, what was her name again, his sister's name?
Speaker 1: Oh, Carrie Fitchett [Carrie Hansberry Fitchett].
Speaker 2: Carrie Fidget?
Speaker 1: Carrie Washington Fitchett, F-I-T-C-H-E-T-T.
Speaker 2: Oh, Carrie.
Speaker 1: And she was born in Gloster [Mississippi] as well.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: After my father's father [Elden Hayes Hansberry] died, his mother [Harriet Pauline Bailey] married a Mr. Washington [Elijah Washington].  They always called him, I found out, Buster [ph.] Washington and she had four children from that marriage.  And so this was a, Carrie was the first born of those four children.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So it was really my father's half-sister.  But her husband had been teaching down at Claflin College [Claflin University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] in South Carolina and then they came here to Howard and he was in the sociology department.  He eventually got Parkinson's disease and died.  But this is a long answer to (laughter) the fact that my father was advisor to African students, he had his own family, and then he also took on the family of his sister, if anything, you know, was needed she would call and ask him to do certain things.  So it didn't leave a lot of time for a lot of outside activities.
Story_ID: 482420
Speaker 1: I have a question, though, that just occurred to me and I've thought about it before and I just, there may be an answer to it.  He was an Alpha [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you said, and the symbol for the Alpha is the Sphinx.  Now I just wondered if your father's research had anything to do with the Alpha symbol being this Sphinx because that would have been in the early days of Alpha, and I just wondered.
Speaker 2: I don't know.  That's an interesting question.
Speaker 1: Of course, he wasn't the first one to talk about the ancient Egyptians being African but, you know--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --I just wondered if that was (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) When did the Alphas start in 1908, '07 [1907]?
Speaker 1: Not--I'm not--
Speaker 2: Something like that--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think so.
Speaker 2: --and I'm sure the Sphinx was something that began before he became a member so I don't know.  That's a good question to (laughter) research, I suppose (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, speaking of this Sphinx, let's talk about this trip to Egypt.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And this is, you said a pivotal point in your life, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It's a pivotal point in, in black history.  I don't think that there's any other figure that in our history that they went there and stayed a year and, you know, and conducted research and so forth.  So what was it like for you?  Now did, how did you find out you were going to Egypt as a, as a kid, as a--
Speaker 2: I remember my parents [Myrtle Kelso Hansberry and William Leo Hansberry] filling out the application forms, this was as a Fulbright research scholar.  And my, my mother would type these forms and I remember them taking the, the form down to the post office so it would be postmarked, you know, by midnight that particular cut-off date.  And then they got word, I don't know how, how much later that we were going to Cairo [Egypt].  And so I guess it was just a, you know, an announcement, I don't remember anything specifically about, about that announcement but I guess I was very glad to go and I found that was really sort of the best year of my life.  It was, it, it had such an impact on me.  You know, I grew up here in Washington [D.C.] with people who were primarily academic colleagues of my father's, with their children.  But Egypt was completely different.  It, you know, the saying, how do you keep them down on the farm after they've seen Paris [France].  But it, it, it broadened my perspective.  I mean, I already had a fairly broad perspective, I didn't know that I was usual at the time but it broadened my perspective and to live in a completely different country.  On the way there, we took the ship over, we left, I was, I, I realized I had kept a diary, (laughter) well several diaries of my, of that year there.  We left at the end of August 1953.  The ship took about twelve days to get there.  We stopped in Barcelona [Spain], Marseille [France], and Naples [Italy].  And I can remember specifically taking a ride along the Amalfi Drive when we stopped in Naples and everybody was kind of frightened because the bus that we were in seemed to be too long for the very winding roads there at the Bay of Naples, overlooking the Bay of Naples.  And I could look out of the bus window and look straight down into, I don't know, a thousand feet into the Bay of Naples.  And this kind of upset several people (laughter) on the bus but, you know, at the age of thirteen I just was so excited by the whole thing.  And then we arrived in, in Alexandria [Egypt] thirteen days after we left New York [New York].  And I had a birthday on the ship so I turned fourteen.
Story_ID: 482421
Speaker 1: Cairo [Egypt] is just completely different.  Oh, I was saying that on the way over we stopped in Barcelona [Spain] and Marseille [France] and, and Naples [Italy] but they were very western countries, when we got to Cairo it was a very different type of experience.  You know, you had camels and you had goats and you had sheep in the street and you had different kinds of people speaking different languages and or a different language although you, you know, language that I had not been familiar with which was Arabic.  And they dressed very differently.  And it was just completely different and brand new for me and I guess it, it, it allowed my sense of curiosity to come forward and my sense of adventure to come forward.  So it was, it was, a very sort of liberating and freeing type of experience.
Speaker 2: Now were there, were there many people in Cairo that looked like you?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, most of the people were of color.  I was, I, I guess, I really thought that most Egyptians would be of color but there, but the color ranged the gamut.  You had very, very fair Egyptians, you had very dark Egyptians.  You had lots of people who were from Greece, you had lots of Greeks who lived, who lived in Cairo.  And but I guess in a way, subtly, I was aware that I was in a, in a, in an environment where I was the majority in terms of skin color and many people took us to be Egyptians.  One of the things that young girls did not do was to wear pants.  Well, when we first arrived at, in Cairo we stayed at the Mena House Hotel [Cairo, Egypt] which is just at the foot of the pyramids.  And I remember, I was so impressed, we had, we took several steamer trunks but we had one big wardrobe and Big Boy [ph.], I think that's what his nickname was or so, he was a very large man probably from Nubia [Egypt] or some place and he put this steamer chest, trunk on his back and carried it up the steps (laughter) to, to our room or so.  And as I said many people thought that we were Egyptians and I would go horseback riding several times there near the pyramids and I always kind of wondered here I was look like an Egyptian girl but I was wearing in those days they were called dungarees.  So, you know, it was kind of an interesting experience to see people sort of react to me wearing something that would not be ordinarily worn by an Egyptian girl.  But the stay at the Mena House Hotel was very interesting.  I think we stayed there maybe three weeks or so until my parents [Myrtle Kelso Hansberry and William Leo Hansberry] could find a, an apartment.  And I remembered we would have breakfast in the breakfast room.  We would have lunch in the lunch room or the big dining room, and then dinner would be on the veranda.  And each evening the waiter would come up and stand behind my mother and say, "Good evening, Madame, thick soup, consomme, hot or cold," (laughter).  And I thought that was kind of, I don't know for some reason that kind of stuck in my mind 'cause it was the same, same greeting every, every day, every evening.  And so we were there for about three weeks or so and then we moved into Cairo itself, a building called the Isis Building [Isis Hotel, Cairo, Egypt] or Isis Building,   I-S-I-S, which was across from the British embassy as well as the American embassy and about a block and a half from the Nile River.  On a clear day you could barely make out the pyramids, many miles away.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause the pyramids are out at Giza [Egypt], right?
Speaker 1: Pyramids were in Giza, yeah, and the Mena House was just at the foot of the pyramids, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So--
Speaker 1: But there was also a song, "See the pyramids along the Nile," a favorite song of mine, 'When You Belong to Me' [sic. 'You Belong to Me'] or something like that.  And so I could actually say, yes, I have seen the pyramids standing near the Nile and seeing the pyramids far in the distance but that song made such an impact because of my being there at the time.

Speaker 1: So you went to school there too, right?
Speaker 2: I went to school, yeah, I was in the tenth grade.  I went to, to the Manor House English school [Manor House School, Cairo, Egypt].  Most of, most of the students from the age of twelve up were, I wanna say, I went to school with girls.  The, the, the school was coed up until the age of twelve or so and you had lots of Saudi boys who went to that school.  But from the age of twelve up, I was in classes with girls only.  And I was very impressed that these girls were all fluent in Arabic, English, and French because the schools started, started the students learning all three languages.  So there were four non-Egyptians in the class, another American, I believe, a girl from Australia, and a girl from England or so.  And we did not have any language because here in Washington [D.C.] you didn't start a foreign language until you were in the tenth grade, I guess, until, you were in high school.  So we had this makeshift French class for the (laughter) four of us.  And I learned enough French to get around in French speaking countries but it wasn't--it wouldn't have been the same foundation I guess I would have had had I started school or a French class here in Washington because it was a, a makeup class or a makeshift class for us.  But one of the other things I thought was very interesting, they had little workbooks and we didn't write in pencil, in pencil but we did everything in pen, including math and they called it maths, so we had arithmetic and algebra and geometry all at the same time and everything was done in pen.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Then those are in, not in ballpoint but in, was it in, in the fountain pens or--
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know whether it was fountain pen or ballpoint.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it could have been ballpoint--
Speaker 2: But it was--
Speaker 1: --yeah, it would be about the time that (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But it was something that you couldn't really erase.  And then we had to wear uniforms.  I remember gray skirts, gray jackets, and a tie (laughter) which I thought was very interesting so I became very proficient at tying a tie.  And I remembered learning ping-pong there at school, during recess we played ping-pong or so.  And then I also joined the Girl Guides while I was there at school.
Speaker 1: Now that's similar to the Girls Scouts [Girl Scouts of the United States of America], I guess?
Speaker 2: That's similar to the Girl Scouts.  And I was a member of the Girl Scouts here in Washington and I have some pictures of a Girl Scout troop.  One of my, the mother of one of my friends was in charge of the Girl Scout troop here in Washington.  I had mentioned one colleague, Dr. Snowden [Frank M. Snowden, Jr.] when there was, whose daughter I grew up with.  There was also another one, the librarian here at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], Joseph Reason [Joseph Henry Reason], and I played with his daughter, Barbara Reason [Barbara Reason Butler], and so they lived around the corner from us in Brookland [Washington, D.C.].  And so I, well, no, I just thought of, thought of that--her mother [Bernice Chism Reason] was the Girl Scout troop leader or, or the, the troop leader for the Girl Scouts, Barbara's mother was.
Story_ID: 482423
Speaker 1: Did you get a chance to go further down the Nile [Nile River] to--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --the other sites?  Luxor [Egypt] or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was wonderful, Luxor, Aswan [Egypt].  I went with some of the other Fulbright families.  As I mentioned the trip to Cairo [Egypt] took about twelve days or so and all of the families that were Fulbrighters who had, were Fulbright researchers, research scholars all traveled on the ship together.  So we all became very well acquainted on the ship and lived near each other and maintained contact once we were in Cairo.  And they all had children anywhere from the age of three, I guess, to sixteen, so we were all fairly close, you know, it was seven different families or so.
Speaker 1: Yeah, from, from different colleges around the (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Different colleges here in the, in the U.S., yes.
Speaker 1: Now, now was there any, any malingering flavor or racism, American racism and segregation in, on this trip (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) in Cairo?  Oh, on the trip?
Speaker 1: Yes, right.  I just wondered because, you know, many places here were segregated and I was wondering if they, any of that followed the Fulbright scholars to Egypt.
Speaker 2: No, no, I don't think so.  I think any, any, any scholar who was going to Egypt would not have had a sense of (laughter) or this is just my impression, a sense of racism.  I never had that feeling at all.  We were the only black family among the group.  No, and, and, and at that time there was this book that had just come out 'The Ugly American' [Eugene Burdick and William J. Lederer].  So if anything, you know, it was Americans in general who were sort of looked down upon, but because we were of color we were not looked down (laughter) upon as such.  And sometimes you could see from the very few tourists who were there, there was a sense of entitlement on the part of other Americans who might have been visiting but as far as the group that we were with, there was no problem at all.  I remember my parents [Myrtle Kelso Hansberry and William Leo Hansberry] said that they were invited to a reception or so and they got lost, they weren't where they were supposed to be and so they were asking different people along the way in English, you know, where is such and such an address.  And they didn't speak English and my parents didn't speak Arabic, but they were so sort of befuddled or surprised.  Why do these people who look like us not speaking (laughter) to us in Arabic, in our own language?  So it was, it was just a wonderful experience.  We actually went to a, the Muhammad Ali mosque [Mosque of Muhammad Ali, Cairo, Egypt] and I think it's the largest mosque in, in Cairo.  And you could go, tourists could go during any time other than prayer time and we asked the person who guided us, the guide there if we could come back for a service or on Fridays and he said yes, yes, yes.  So my family and Louise McCarthy [Louise McCarthy Mehta] who was the daughter of Professor McCarthy [Stephen A. McCarthy], blonde hair, blue eyes, the five of us went up to the mosque and when we had visited before, we just put pads on our shoes and went into mosque but this time we had to take off our shoes and, you know, the, the, the Egyptians had ablutions before they went in and so on.  So we went in and we found out that women were on one side and my father was on the other side.  And we actually, we didn't know what to do.  And there was a woman there who, I always said sold eggs on Farid Street [Mohamed Farid Street] who knew Louise and her family and so she knew that we were not Egyptians.  So she would kind of tell us to stay seated, point, you know, motion to us to stay seated when the women and the men would get up to pray.  And then when the whole thing was over she said (speaking Arabic) "Khallas," you know, finished.  And so it was very interesting to have that little by play, the, the lady who sold eggs on Farid Street, who recognized Louise and so that was just a wonderful experience.  Later we found out that maybe no non-Muslims should have gone to the service but I don't know if that's actually true or not.  I mean, now you can, at least in this country but I don't know how it is worldwide.
Story_ID: 482424
Speaker 1: Did you develop any relationships with the local people in Egypt, the, the Egyptians that that, you know, where, where you could correspond to 'em after you come, you came back?
Speaker 2: I think I did with a few but, you know, it didn't last very long.  These were some of the girls that I had met in my class, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were there a year, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, almost a year.
Speaker 1: Okay, almost a year.
Speaker 2: It was a school year, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: From August, September to--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --June and July.
Speaker 1: Did your father [William Leo Hansberry] seem satisfied with having, you know, been able to go over there for a year and--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, he could actually see some of the sights that he had written about.  We went, as I said to Upper Egypt and then we also took a trip to the Sudan, to Wadi Halfa.  And then when we came home he went with us as far as Rome [Italy] because we took a ship back, two ships back, stopped in Athens [Greece] and then we went to Rome [Italy] and Venice [Italy].  My mother [Myrtle Kelso Hansberry], sister [Kay Hansberry], and I came back to the United States on the Constitution [USS Constitution], I believe it was and then my father went back to Africa to do some more archeological digs and, and research in other countries, in East and West Africa and joined us back here several months later.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.  So that must have been a satisfying trip (laughter), right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, it was a satisfying trip for him and he was connected with the University of Cairo [sic. Cairo University, Giza, Egypt] there.  And Egypt was the only country at that time that had a full, that a Fulbright, only country in Africa that had a Fulbright office, so if you wanted to go to Africa, Egypt was the country that you went to.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 482425
Speaker 1: So when you came back you went to--
Speaker 2: McKinley High School [McKinley Technical High School; McKinley Technology High School, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: --McKinley High School, okay (unclear).
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  I was zoned for McKinley, was in the first class, integrated class and that was a fine experience too, you know, no problems.  Many of the boys from Armstrong Technical High School [Samuel Chapman Armstrong Technical High School; Armstrong Manual Training School, Washington, D.C.] also went to McKinley.  McKinley was a technical school, technical high school, Armstrong was a technical high school so they merged.  And you had asked about a particular teacher there or a particular teacher prior and I remember oh, dear, the name just escapes me, Miss Brett [ph.], Miss Brett that's what her name was, she was an English teacher.  And for some reason she made an impact (laughter) on me.  I don't know exactly how but she was a very good teacher there at McKinley.  And here at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] I remember the humanities teacher Arthur Davis [Arthur P. Davis], made an impact on me, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well and, and you were, when you were in high school did you, did you have an idea of what you wanted to do, you know, with your life (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I didn't know what I wanted to do.  I didn't know what I wanted to do.  I majored in, in, in art here because of my interest in art.  I went to graduate school at Smith College [Northampton, Massachusetts], got a master's [degree] in art history but I was much more interested in practical art as we called it, actually making things, doing things.  And when I was at Smith, I became aware of Leonard Baskin who was a well-known sculptor and graphic artist.  And I took his graphics course in the basement of the art building there and that's when I became aware of making books by hand, setting the type by hand.  I had done etchings of insects by hand, printing them by hand, binding the books, so I have a little, a copy of my first little book, an addition of seven that I made at Smith.  And then when I was in New York [New York] I made a larger edition ['Insects and Haiku,' Gail Hansberry Mattox] of that same book of insects which included haiku.
Story_ID: 482426
Speaker 1: I didn't wanna get you to far out here, take you back to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] for a minute and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so you graduated from McKinley [McKinley Technical High School; McKinley Technology High School, Washington, D.C.] in what, what year was it?
Speaker 2: Fifty-six [1956].
Speaker 1: Fifty-six [1956], all right.  And you start at Howard that same year?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Joined the AKA's [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority] in '57 [1957].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Graduated in '60 [1960].  I did not wanna come to Howard because my father [William Leo Hansberry] was teaching here.  But I think in the total scheme of things, it was very good that I was here (laughter).  And I only actually ran into him once on campus that I can recall so, you know, there was a sense of autonomy and I didn't have the feeling that he was constantly looking over my shoulder.  But also I lived at home so I did not the experience of living in a dorm--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --here but I lived at home (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, how did you, I mean, was there a discussion about you going to another school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, there was.  I actually applied to several other schools but, you know, my father being an academic he was not a wealthy person, he did not make a lot of money, so it just kind of worked out that I would have needed a scholarship, either the scholarship wasn't sufficient, and we investigated other schools and finally I, I came here so, yeah, this was where I ended up and I was very glad to have been here.
Story_ID: 482427
Speaker 1: What kind of activities did you, did you get involved in as a, well, the first thing we wanna talk about is something we failed to mention is that you get free tuition if your parents are--
Speaker 2: Yes so I did get remission of tuition (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, all right.
Speaker 1: Tuition was not very expensive at the time, I think you could take a whole class for twenty-one dollars, seven dollars a credit hour or so.  But I did get free tuition because my father [William Leo Hansberry] taught here.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So what kind of activities were you involved as a freshman?
Speaker 1: I was the treasurer of the freshmen class.  I was a Campus Pal which was to help other students, I guess, when I was a sophomore to help them, the freshmen when they came in.  And I was also in charge of the gift committee of the senior class to determine what the senior class gift would be.  So and then as I said I, I became a member of AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority].  And I'm sure there were other activities on campus that I was involved in during the time but those were the ones that actually stand out at the moment.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And you were majoring in, in art?
Speaker 1: In art, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Was there a discussion about that that major as such?
Speaker 1: I don't know if there was any specific discussion about it.  I'm sure there must have been some sort of discussion but nothing stands out.
Speaker 2: I know sometimes parents have trepidations when their children decide to become arts, art majors or--
Speaker 1: Oh, no, no.
Speaker 2: --actors or that sort of thing, so.
Speaker 1: --no, no, not from that standpoint--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --how was I gonna earn a living.  I didn't know what I was gonna do and, and after, after I, I graduated from here, I went to Smith College [Northampton, Massachusetts] as I said and got a master's degree in art history.  And I didn't, again didn't know quite what I was going to do but I knew whatever I did I didn't want to be a teacher (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, let's go back a little bit to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  I, I just wanted to know like who were some of the teachers at Howard in the, the art department and elsewhere--
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.
Speaker 2: --that made an impact on you here?
Speaker 1: Lois Jones [Lois Mailou Jones], again, these were all family friends in a way.  James Porter [James A. Porter], Dorothy [Dorothy Porter Wesley], James Porter was chairman of the art department.  His daughter, Connie Porter [Constance Burnett Porter Uzelac], I played with.  His wife and Connie's mother was Dorothy Porter here at Moorland-Spingarn Collection [Moorland-Spingarn Research Center, Washington, D.C.].  And James Wells who was in the art department, he was in the graphics section and I knew his son--James Lesesne Wells.  So, you know, it was a very sort of familiar setting and familiar people growing up and being on campus even before I was a student, you know, I had met Prince Luthuli [Albert John Luthuli] from South Africa, the Crown Prince of Ethiopia in my connection with my father's African concerns.
Speaker 2: Yeah, was that, was that when he won the Nobel, I mean, he, he won the Nobel Prize I know in the '50s [1950s] but was that--
Speaker 1: It was, it was the Haile Selassie Prize [Haile Selassie I Prize Trust] for, I just saw the, the correct title of it, it has a long title but that was in 1964, it was supposed to be for Africa what the Nobel Prize was for Europe.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so he was one of the first recipients to receive the Haile Selassie Prize Trust award--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --in 1964.
Speaker 2: Well, he also won the Nobel Peace Prize one year.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Albert Luthuli, Chief Luthuli?
Speaker 1: Oh, oh, oh, Prince Luthuli.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, I thought--
Speaker 2: Oh, that it was a different one?
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, I'm, I thought you were talking about my father.
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: Oh (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, Albert Luthuli, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  No, it was my father who won the--
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 1: --Haile Selassie Prize Trust award (laughter) but--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --Prince Luthuli, yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 2: He was the first black to receive the Nobel Prize, I believe, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Uh-huh, okay.  Okay.  Yes.  But I mean I grew up knowing people like this.  I knew Ralph Bunche and played with his daughters and sons, they were, son, they were a little bit older than I but I was aware of them.  And many of the other well-known people, or people who became well known, you know, I just sort of grow, grew up knowing these people and most had a Howard connection.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Knowing them or at least meeting them.
Story_ID: 482428
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite teacher here at, at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] or--
Speaker 2: I think the person that impacted me the most whom I did not know before I came here was Arthur Davis [Arthur P. Davis] whom I had mentioned just a little while ago.  He was, I recall in the English department but he taught the humanities class and we all had to take humanities, you know, like a core course.  And he was funny, he was amusing, and he gave us these big books that we had to read.  And I guess I was so sort of intrigued that, you know, none of the books had pictures in them and now we had to, we were in college and we had to settle down and read these big books that had no pictures (laughter).  But he, he, he stood out.  Miss Brett [ph.] and, in, at McKinley High School [McKinley Technical High School; McKinley Technology High School, Washington, D.C.] and, and Arthur Davis here.  And I, I can't sort of express why but I was just very taken with their presentation and so on.  You know, these were people that I did not know beforehand 'cause the other teachers some of whom I did know beforehand.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Well, those were, I don't know, was, was Howard Thurman still on campus then?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh, yeah.  I met him, knew him, mention some more, I probably, you know, met them and knew them.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, now I kept drawing a blank--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --but this is, this is, this place is a rich place of--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --I don't know if Sterling Brown was here.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And Merze Tate in the history department.  Williston Lofton [Williston H. Lofton] in the history department.  The history department was fairly small at the time and there were times when I would, not when I was a student here but prior to being a student here as, you know, a youngster, I would actually come and sit in on some of my father's [William Leo Hansberry] classes as well, in addition to him lecturing to me on the piano bench when I was five or six I, I would come to school with him on a few occasions when he delivered some of his lectures, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Okay.  Did, did, did he, did he like to lecture at home?  I mean, did, did he just do that when you were a little girl or did they continue?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, a little girl.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So he, eventually he stopped lecturing at home, (laughter) I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah, eventually, I think so.  I mean, my first recollection is I'm a little girl and I'm sitting on the piano bench and he's lecturing about Africa.  I mean, he was so passionate about it.
Story_ID: 482429
Speaker 1: As an art major you said you were more into the practical art.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And so but when you were here did you paint and sculpt or what did you do (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes.  I mean, that's, I took art history courses but I took graphics courses, I took painting courses here and as well as history courses but my focus at Smith [Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts] was history with my real interest in, in learning about, more about graphics and book making.
Speaker 1: Now what drew, drew you to Smith?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know how I happened to go there.  They had an art department, they, (laughter) they let me in.  I don't quite know how I went to Smith, maybe I had a scholarship there but the mechanics of getting there I don't really recall.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So you went there to work on a, a M.F.A.?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Unclear) M.A.
Speaker 1: An M.A., okay.
Speaker 2: And there weren't many black people at Smith at the time.  There were, how many people, and this was graduate school and Smith is primarily an undergraduate school, so there were maybe three other people, three graduate students of color or six, I can't remember, and then a few undergraduates of color.  But my sister [Kay Hansberry] actually went to Smith, I finished Smith in '62 [1962], my sister finished high school in, oh, when did she finish high school?  Well, she finished, she went to Smith also as an undergraduate and she finished in '69 [1969] I believe, from Smith.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So there were many more black students on the campus at that time than there were when I was there in the early '60s, [1960s], '60s [1960s], '60 [1960] to '62 [1962].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were there any teachers at Smith that were, were significant that you--
Speaker 2: Well, Leonard Baskin was significant, and Henry-Russell, Henry-Russell Hitchcock who was well known in the field of architecture, he, he kind of stood out.  And my thesis advisor, Mr. Fernandez [James William Fernandez].  Goodness, I hadn't thought about him in a long time.  He-- I remember him as well.
Story_ID: 482430
Speaker 1: Well when you finished in '62 [1962] at Smith [Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts] what did you do next?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I, I went to France for the summer.  I went with Lois Jones [Lois Mailou Jones].  She took several, excuse me, trips, had several trips that she would take her students on.  I went to France for six weeks, primarily in Paris [France] and we would, you know, visit the museums.  Went to the Ecole de la Grande Chaumiere [sic. Academie de la Grande Chaumiere, Paris, France], which was an art school there.  Then I remember painting on the street corners, you know, in water color, in Paris.  And my thesis at Smith was a comparison between rock paintings in Africa with cave paintings, ancient prehistoric paintings in Europe.  And so I was able to go to Southern France to see some of the caves that I had, that I had included, the rock art of, of, in the caves that I had included, cave art that I had included in my thesis.  So that was a good, a good six weeks in, in Paris.  But all of sudden as I said, I didn't know what I was going to do beforehand but all of a sudden I decided I was going to teach.  Prior to that time I didn't want to teach, mainly because my mother [Myrtle Kelso Hansberry] was a teacher, she was now teaching French at Alice Deal Junior High School [Alice Deal Middle School, Washington, D.C.].  My father [William Leo Hansberry] was a teacher, I didn't know what I wanted to do but I knew I didn't wanna teach and then all of a sudden while I was in Paris I decided I wanted to teach.  I came back, my first job was at the National Gallery of Art [Washington, D.C.] in the publications office.  I understand that I was the first black person in a non-service capacity at the National Gallery of Art.  And being in the publications office, I was selling postcards, you know, in their publications, in the, in the store, their, their, their store there, which was a wonderful first job, nice location, nice environment.
Speaker 1: Now, this is 1963 or--
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty [1960]--
Speaker 1: Or is it still '62 [1962]--
Speaker 2: Two [1962], '63 [1963], yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Sixty-two [1962], '63 [1963].  And I did that for about, oh, several months.  It was a great first job.
Story_ID: 482431
Speaker 1: And then, while I was working at the National Gallery of Art [Washington, D.C.] during the day, I would take education courses here at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] at night (laughter).  And it was probably '63 [1963], the beginning of '63 [1963], April, I guess, my mother [Myrtle Kelso Hansberry] came home, she was teaching at, I'm trying to think where she was 'cause she started out teaching as a social adjustment, the social adjustment classes.  And then she switched over to French but she had heard that Taft Junior High School [Washington, D.C.] needed a, an art teacher because the regular teacher was going out on maternity leave and they had had a substitute for a week, Easter vacation had taken up a week and so they were looking for an art teacher to fill in because at that time if you were pregnant and were beginning to show you had to leave the classroom.  And so I left the National Gallery of Art on Friday thinking I was gonna return on Monday, on Monday I had started teaching.  And I had taken, taken all of the courses except practiced teaching.  So my practice teaching was actually (laughter) in the classroom.  And I filled, finished out the, the semester of that year.  So I was only in the classroom April, May, June, maybe two, two and a half months.  And Mrs. Snowden was also an art teacher so it was kind of interesting as opposed to being my teacher at Banneker Junior High School [Benjamin Banneker Junior High School; Benjamin Banneker Academic High School, Washington, D.C.], she was now my colleague (laughter) or I was her colleague at Taft Junior High school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And it was, it turned out very well.  It turned out very well, I think.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So teaching in a public school in those days was a good, a good experience (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it worked all right.  I remember there was sort of like a small social adjustment class that the assistant principal was concerned about.  And he thought that I might have some trouble with him but I had no trouble with him at all.  It was, I guess, these student were about twelve, thirteen years old.  But what made such an impact upon me was there were two, two girls in the class who stood out to me, and one was short and one was quite tall and, and, and large.  And what really impacted me was the fact that they would do whatever I asked them to do, what they wanted was someone to pay attention to them.  And, you know, at the age of, how old was I, twenty-three, I guess, I didn't know that psychological issues were something that sort of impacted children, I thought it was something that only adults (laughter) were affected by.  But I realized that, you know, everybody wants to have somebody pay attention to them, and be concerned about them so I had absolutely no difficulty with that particular class.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But it was a learning experience for me.
Story_ID: 482432
Speaker 1: What, was, in those days having received a master's [degree] in, in art from a, a good school like Smith [Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts], was there a sense at, at Smith or, or even at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] of, of African American art history or--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, oh, yes.  Mr. Porter [James A. Porter] had written a book about African American art ['Modern Negro Art,' James A. Porter] so there was always knowledge of black artists.  There was the Barnett-Aden Gallery [Washington, D.C.] that I was familiar with, knew about practically all of my life here.  So, yeah, there was definitely knowledge of black artists, some whom were classically trained.  Even Miss Joes, Lois Jones [Lois Mailou Jones], Pierre-Noel [Louis Vergniaud Pierre-Noel] when she got married, married a Haitian man, was classically trained in Boston [Massachusetts], she was a Bostonian, I believe.  So there was always a knowledge of everything being afro-centric and whether it was art or history or English or whatever, the whole orientation was African, or African American, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 482433
Speaker 1: So, how long did you stay at, at Taft [Taft Junior High School, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Oh, just a few months.  I just finished out that semester from April, May, June, two, two and a half months--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to finish the semester for the teacher who went out on maternity leave.  And then I heard that there was a position of teaching art history at North Carolina College [North Carolina College at Durham; North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina] as it was called in those days.  So I went down there to teach art history as a core course in the summer, late summer, early fall of 1963.
Speaker 1: And Durham, North Carolina, which had been a segregated city had just opened a few weeks before I got there, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Was, I should say integrated--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --a few weeks before I got there.  I went down to teach for one year and I stayed three years (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.  So did, did you like being in North Carolina that, at that time?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I did.  It was, it was a nice experience, I met lots of nice people.  The campus was nice, it was, it was, it was a chance to be away again in a different setting comparable to what perhaps I might have expected had I gone away to, to college but now I was older, I had been to France.  It was interesting, I remember as I said I was 23 when I came here maybe 24, 24 when I went to, when I went to Durham or barely 24, had just turned twenty-four.  But the point was that some of the students in my classes joined the class because they didn't believe I was the teacher (laughter).  And so that was an interesting experience as well.
Story_ID: 482434
Speaker 1: Had you picked up photography at this point at all (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no not as such.  I had taken photographs during my trip to Egypt but I--
Speaker 1: Oh, as a fourteen year old?  I mean, a thirteen year old [sic.]?
Speaker 2: As a, oh, yeah, oh yeah, we had lots of pictures from, from Cairo [Egypt] and Upper Egypt and the, the, the cities that we stopped in on the way.  But as far as making a living or trying to make a living as a photographer and taking photographs, I call more art photographs, no, I had not thought of that.  That was just sort of a natural progression when I went to New York [New York].
Story_ID: 482435
Speaker 1: How long did you stay at North Carolina College [North Carolina College at Durham; North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Three years.
Speaker 1: Three years, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So you were there through 1966?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And that was the heyday of--that was the heyday for civil rights organizing in the South.  Would, did, was there anything going on--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --in that, in Durham [North Carolina] in those days?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess that was the time of the Freedom Riders.  I remember there was a chaplain on campus who, who took a group from NCC to Mexico on an American Friends Service Committee sponsored work-study program so to speak, it was a very short program, maybe a couple of weeks.  And we took the bus from Durham to Mexico and it was just after many of the bus bombings, bombings but the interstate, interstate travel had become legal, I mean, black people could, could, could ride on these buses.  And I remember we went through the South and, and this was the first time in the South although Washington [D.C.] is southern, and it was segregated when I grew up, we took the bus and went through Georgia, Atlanta, further down, I know we went through Mississippi, and Mississippi with my father [William Leo Hansberry] being from Mississippi and always, it always had the connotation of being the worst state, I, he would say, "Mississippi it was a good place to be from (laughter) and not to go back and live there."  So we went and we'd go into, this was an integrated group because the chaplain at NCC was white, and then I'm there, and his wife, and I don't know if all the students were black but it was a small group, maybe ten people, and we would go into the white waiting room in the bus station in Atlanta [Georgia], in Jackson [Mississippi].  But then we went to Natchez, the bus stopped in Natchez, Mississippi, and I remembered getting out and heading toward the closest waiting room which was a white waiting room and this big burly, I don't know, policeman or so went to the door and put his arm up and said oh, no, you don't, not allowing me into, me or the others into the waiting room.  So we proceeded to get back on the bus and I remember the bus driving through Louisiana with the lovely tree branches, you know, covering the, the road and then we continued our trip into Mexico, Mexico City.  But, you know, these are just little things that stand out in your mind (laughter) along the way.  And we were down in, in Mexico at a small village about two hours out of Mexico City called San Pedro Clotanago [ph.] or some such title, and we helped to, to paint the doors of the school and serve meals and do whatever needed to be done in the village and we were actually living in the home of, of one of the residents in the village.  And we had, we took our sleeping bags and slept on cots in the home.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did, was, now there's a, a famous sculptor, black sculptor in Mexico, I don't know if you ran across her, I'm, I'm trying to think of who it, I know, [HistoryMaker] Elizabeth Catlett is it, is it (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Oh, printmaker, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: No, I didn't, I don't know how long she has, had lived there.  She was married to a Mexican artist as well, Mr. Mora [Francisco Mora], I believe.  I have some of her artwork but I didn't meet her there or see her there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You know, 'cause Mexico is famous for Diego Rivera and--
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: --did, was that part of the mission to look at some of the murals of his or anything (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, not as such.  I'm sure we saw some but this whole focus on this particular trip was to really help in a village, it was a work-study program.  Whereas the trip with Miss Jones [Lois Mailou Jones] to, to Paris [France] and then some later trips that I had with her were, the focus was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was art.
Speaker 2: --art related.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So it was more, okay, so it had more practical--
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --okay, all right, purpose.
Story_ID: 482436
Speaker 1: Any other stories from North Carolina College [North Carolina College at Durham; North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: No.  I think I met several people whom I've been in touch with since then.  The chairman of the art department here at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] had been a student of mine at NCC, Winston Kennedy, he was in one of my classes.  And Newton [James E. Newton], Mr. Newton, was an artist and, dear, I can't remember his first name all of a sudden, but he was at the University of Delaware, I believe, in Newark, Delaware.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Is that Delaware, Delaware, it wasn't Delaware State [sic.] was it?
Speaker 1: Could be.
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I've lost touch with him so I just, I'm just now thinking of that.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.  So, so what happened after north, North Carolina College?
Speaker 2: I went to New York [New York].  I was interested in bookmaking, making books by hand.  And since I had made this, a, a small version of a book by hand at Smith [Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts], I wanted to pursue, bookmaking by hand.  And I found out though that you don't make a living making books by hand.  So I actually got a job in New York at a commercial book publishing company but I found out that bookmaking is all mathematical, you don't set the type, you don't design the book, it's all sort of mechanically done.  And so I did not stay at that, well, it was just a summer job so I realized that book design was not, on a commercial level, it was not for me.  And then I got a job at Time-Life Books and I was a researcher there for nine years.  And with my background in art I started out as a researcher on the series of, their art series.  And I think 'Cezanne' was the first book that I worked on and I was in charge of researching the marginals, the chapters, with the, the, the, that illustrated the paintings.  And there were various different aspects of researching that I did, whether it was on the art series as I said, the gardening series, I did work on the photography series and that's when my interest in photography really kind of picked up--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --by working on that series.
Story_ID: 482445
Speaker 1: Tell this story, this Time-Life [Time-Life Books] story the, the interesting story from Time-Life about, about the African series.
Speaker 2: There was a series of books, I believe it's the, the, the World Library, talking about different countries or continents, the life, Time-Life Library of the World [Life World Library] or so.  And one of the books in that series was called 'Tropical Africa' [Robert Coughlan].  And one of the other colleagues of mine, other researchers, pointed out to me that there was some sort of discrepancy in one of the, under one of the pictures, the captions of one of the pictures in the book which said, "Out of bloodshot eyes" or, "These African stare balefully out of bloodshot eyes."  And then further on down it said, "Africa had a faceless terrain, and one of the surprises is that mankind was able to live at all in Africa."  And so I was really kind of perturbed and wondering how could someone say that?  And this particular volume was being updated, but no black people--and there were several black researchers at Time-Life Books--were asked to update this book.  And so the other researcher and I wrote a note, went into the head researcher, the lady in charge of researchers and we stated that there were inconsistencies and, you know, problems with the wording, the facts, in this book on tropical Africa.  And when she closed the door, well, that was kind of a bad sign that we had to explain our, to explain ourselves as to why we were questioning some of these statements.  And so I had to tell her that man originated in Africa and, you know, that one shouldn't make a statement that it was a faceless terrain where it was difficult for, for, for man to exist.  And several other (laughter) misstated facts.  And so she just said, "Yes, thank you," and we left.  And shortly after that when they had an economic cutback I was one of the people who was let go.  And I always thought that maybe that sort of contributed to helping them decide who they wanted to get rid of because I questioned the content of the book.  And actually, I mean, it shows (laughter) what youth can do.  I even tried to get the book, keep it from being printed because several of us including my mother [Myrtle Kelso Hansberry] went through the book with a fine-toothed comb and we pointed out all of these sort of inconsistencies or erroneous statements.  And but I thought that I could keep the book from being published, republished, and, of course, it was published the way they had kept it.  But that was just a (laughter) a period of youth and exuberance in thinking that I could help to, to remedy a situation that was erroneous.
Speaker 1: Now was your father [William Leo Hansberry] still alive at this time or--
Speaker 2: No, no, no, he had--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --died, he had died in '65 [1965].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And this was probably the early '70s [1970s] when that happened.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Well that, by that time, by the early '70s [1970s], you, you were there nine years you said at (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was there nine years--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --from '67 [1967] to '76 [1976], I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And certainly there had been a, sort of, sort of a revolution in black history awareness and that sort of thing by then.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know, so that was, that's (unclear) really a strange kind of an incident--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in a lot of ways.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Because people knew better or at least (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, some people knew better but I would think that, you know, if you, since you had black researchers on the staff, and there was sort of an awakening of black history and African history and knowledge of African history that, you know, you wouldn't continue to find misstatements in a book published by such a well-known company.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause they had, they had even published by then Time-Life 'History of African Kingdoms' [sic. 'Great Ages of Man: African Kingdoms,' Basil Davidson] you know, with--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And this just--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --seems strange that they would not--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --yeah.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, that's the way it goes, I guess.
Story_ID: 482446
Speaker 1: So what did you do, do then after you were, you know, left Time-Life [Time-Life Books] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, after '76 [1976], I stayed in New York [New York], I, I tried my hand as being a freelance, at being a freelance photographer because I also worked on the Time-Life photography series and I did how-to's and met lots of photographers, Time-Life photographers, who would bring their work into, into life as well as to illustrate the, the, the book series.  And I guess based on my background as, well my background in art and being a visual person and having taken pictures, photographs in, in Cairo [Egypt], I thought I could take photographs.  And so I would take, I took several series of photographs there in New York.  I walked across the Brooklyn Bridge [New York, New York] and took photographs of it.  Walked across the George Washington Bridge, took photographs of it.  And this came about when a friend of mine who worked for VOA [Voice of America] and who was at the UN [United Nations] at the time, and a, a photographer as well suggested taking photographs so we went out together and, and photographed.  And, and as a result, I was just so amazed at the different views, the structure, the composition of the George Washington Bridge.  And he and I, his name was Ben Gordon [ph.], who was in charge of English to Africa section at the Voice of America here, but who was working in New York at the UN at the time, I was just amazed to discover as I said all of the different facets, and, and angles of the George Washington Bridge.  And then we went across the Brooklyn Bridge as well and again the facets, different angles and structure of the bridge.  And the Brooklyn Bridge was very different from the George Washington Bridge.  And eventually my first one-woman show was of the George Washington Bridge at the lab that actually photographed or, or, or processed the film in New York.  And then I had two photographs in the centennial show of the Brooklyn Bridge at the Brooklyn Museum [New York, New York] in 1983.  And I was just very pleased about that because they had forty, 20th century photographs in the show, the show itself was massive, it had all sorts of things concerning the Brooklyn Bridge but they had forty 20th century photographs, and I had two of the forty photographs.
Speaker 1: Now, now what year was that?
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty-three [1983].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Bridge (unclear), okay.  And, and what date was your first one woman show?  It was--
Speaker 2: Oh, I have, (laughter) I have a copy of the notice about it.  It was probably around '74 [1974], '75 [1975] something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was a small--it was a little gallery that was attached to the photo processing lab but it sounded good to say, "Yes, I had a one woman show in New York."
Speaker 1: Now did you, were you familiar with some of the other New York photographs in those days, the--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I know [HistoryMaker] Dawoud Bey I know was shooting and--
Speaker 2: Roy DeCarava.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Ming Smith.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Frank Stewart.
Speaker 1: Okay.  [HistoryMaker] Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe was--
Speaker 2: Jeanne Moutoussamy, yeah, I met her there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So there was a group, a small group of artists and photographs whom I knew in New York so there were some people who knew me as a photographer, some people who knew me as a graphic artist.
Story_ID: 482447
Speaker 1: And because I also took, while I was working at Time-Life Books, took the AIGA [American Institute of Graphic Arts] workshop printmaking, printing workshop where I went and printed a larger version of the book of insects that I had made at Smith [Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts].  But this time I, I had discovered, haiku, seventeen-syllable Japanese verse.  And many of the haiku matched the, the insects that I had already printed at Smith.  So I printed the haiku at the AIGA workshop printmaking, printing workshop and then I went to Bob Blackburn's printmaking workshop [Robert Blackburn Printmaking Workshop] and reprinted the etchings that I had done and made a larger edition that included both the etchings and the haiku.  And then on my lunch hours I would run up to a bookbinding workshop and bound the book ['Insects and Haiku,' Gail A. Hansberry Mattox].  So that was an edition of seventeen (laughter).  My first edition of the small book that I had made at Smith was an edition of seven.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Now, I had question, oh, did you write the haikus yourself?
Speaker 1: No, no, no--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --I found the haiku.  Most of the haiku were written by Japanese, I mean the Japanese were noted for their haiku.  So I just took what was in the public domain and printed it in my book but I had to set the type by hand, you know, letter by letter by letter, print it on a printing press and then go down to the printmaking workshop and superimpose the etching plate over the haiku and then bound the book.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The Library of Congress [Washington, D.C.] made the first purchase of the edition and the Schomburg collection [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York] made the last purchase.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: And then there are other individuals and, and schools who purchased as well.
Story_ID: 482448
Speaker 1: So now we're, we're in the late '70s [1970s] now.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Right?  And did, did you, how, how long did you freelance and exhibit?
Speaker 2: From '76 [1976] to the end of '79 [1979].  So I did freelance research, I did some research, picture research, editorial research, and I tried my hand at freelance photography for those three, roughly three years, three and a half years.  And then I came back to Washington [D.C.] at the end of '79 [1979] because my mother [Myrtle Kelso Hansberry] was ill.  And so I guess the effective date of coming back to Washington was the end of '79 [1979], beginning of '80 [1980].  My mother passed away in May of '80 [1980] and so I just stayed here in D.C.  My mother actually died before her mother [Mamie Kelso] did.  So my grandmother outlived my mother by eight years, I believe.  But then I was, my, my grandmother fell and broke her hip the same day her only child died so it was kind of a busy time and so I eventually, her hip mended well but I had to put her in a nursing home.  And at this time, I also found out about escorting international visitors or accompanying international visitors as an English language officer contracted by the U.S. Department of State.  So I would travel around the country with these emerging leaders who had, had, had been invited by the American embassies abroad.  And my grandmother was in the nursing home, plus there were other members of the family who were not well in one (laughter) shape, form, or fashion, so for the next eight, ten, fifteen years, I was sort of the family caretaker.  And this included a cousin, who passed away the year after my mother did in '80 [1980], so she passed away in '81 [1981].  I was responsible for my grandmother until she passed away in '88 [1988], I believe.  And then I, my father's sister [Carrie Hansberry Fitchett] here in D.C. she died in '98 [1998] at the age of ninety-nine and a half.  I was hoping she would hold on until the next year she could be a hundred and then another year she would have seen, or spanned three centuries, 'cause she was born in 1899.  I was hoping she'd live 'til 2000, 2001, but that didn't happen.  And then her baby sister in Chicago [Illinois], my Aunt Mamie [Mamie Hansberry Martin] who passed about four or five years ago at again her late nineties or she may have been a hundred.  So there was a, and then I also have another cousin here, so I have sort of been the family caretaker although I never did have children.  I was married for a short period of time in New York [New York] but it's been an interesting 25 years here in Washington, 25, 26, 27 now, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 482449
Speaker 1: You said you found out about the, the escort job with the U.S. [U.S. Department of State]--
Speaker 2: I, I ran into an artist in New York [New York] and he was doing the same thing and he told me about it.  And it sounded really kind of interesting to do because again it sort of spoke to my sense of adventure and my sense of curiosity and it just sort of worked out that when I came back to Washington [D.C.] all of this happened at the same time I applied to, to be an English language officer.  We used to be called English language escort officers and then they dropped the escort and now we're ELOs, English language officers.  And it just coincided that my mother [Myrtle Kelso Hansberry] became ill and but I was back in Washington by that time and started traveling with these international visitors.  The trips were usually four weeks long, coast to coast.  And, and it was a real learning experience for me, a continuing education I guess you might say, 'cause the people who came over were well known people or about to be well known people in their countries.  And I've gotten to places that I probably never would have gotten to.  I've been to all of the states except North Dakota.  So the operation center of the Alaskan pipeline in, well outside of Anchorage [Alaska].  Been to Cheyenne Mountain and seen the operation center of NORAD [North American Aerospace Defense Command] in Colorado.  Met several [U.S.] Supreme Court justices, was actually in a meeting with President Bush [President George Walker Bush] and, and Condoleezza Rice.  So I never would have gotten these opportunities.
Speaker 1: So it's, it's full of, it sounds like the job is full of a lot of surprises.  You didn't, you don't know necessarily where you're gonna end up sometimes with the--as a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, absolutely not, because each group or individual who, who's brought over has, has an itinerary planned for them and the state department contracts NGOs [non-governmental organizations] to, we call 'em program agencies to actually plan the itineraries of the visitors who come.  And the visitors could be theater people, they could be artists.  I escorted a lot of artists from Africa for a while, university administrators, farmers, they're in all walks of life.
Speaker 1: Are there, there any names that we would recognize or--
Speaker 2: None that I escorted.  But there have been many heads of state, people who were here as international visitors, many years ago, say in the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s] who are now heads of state, Tony Blair, was one, Margaret Thatcher, Hamid Karzai, he was here in 1987 I understand and he's head of Afghanistan.  Anwar Sadat was here.  So yes, there are a number of people who were here as international visitors under this international visitor program who are now heads of state.  But I never escorted (laughter) any of 'em.
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: Maybe that has yet to, to, to materialize.
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, I was gone say that maybe it's gonna happen--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --at some point.
Story_ID: 482450
Speaker 1: But are there any good stories from these, these, there's a, there's a, when you, when they put together, do you put together the itinerary or (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't put together the itinerary.  I, I am contracted by the [U.S.] Department of State, the program agency who puts together, which puts together the itinerary is contracted by the Department of State.  And so there's usually a program team, a program officer, and a program associate, who work together to actually plan the itinerary based on the visitor's interests whether it could be a group, a multiregional group of as many as twenty-nine people, could be a small regional group, people from India, for instance, I just escorted a few months back a group of nine people from India who were interested in trafficking in persons, and that's something that I had not been particularly aware of.  I--
Speaker 1: And they're trying to stop the traffic, the human trafficking (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Human trafficking, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I, I know there was a Nigerian official here, a lady who was doing that and we were trying to get her in Ohio but was that, is that the same person?
Speaker 2: You mean she herself was being trafficked or--
Speaker 1: No, no, she was--
Speaker 2: --escorted?
Speaker 1: --she was, she was talking about the problem, trying to make people aware of the problem and trying to get U.S. support to end it, to end the trafficking in human beings in Nigeria.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, the state department is aware of this so there are many different organizations who are trying to stop human trafficking but apparently most people in the United States aren't even aware that this takes place.  It takes place here in the U.S. and it also is worldwide.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: So how does it work?  Would, would it be that that a, someone in the United States would actually order someone from another country and they, somebody would bring them over to them and (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It could, it could happen that way.
Speaker 1: --to work or a group of people to--
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.  Even migrant workers, some could be trafficked, they may come as migrant laborers but then not be allowed their freedom to go back or we've heard stories here in Washington some diplomats have had nannies or housekeepers to come, they're stripped of their passports, they have to work long hours, they're not getting paid, they're almost slaves in the house, not only of diplomats but other people as well.  And you've been, we've been hearing about that here in Washington [D.C.] recently.  There are all sorts of ways that one can be a slave in quotes of human trafficking could be considered modern day slavery.  And so it takes many forms, many forms.  Or some people from other countries may pay to be brought here, sort of smuggled into the country but once they get here, I guess, illegally or undocumented, they become trapped in a situation that, where they cannot gain their freedom.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --what, what starts out one way may end up being something once they get here, um-hm, something else when they get here.

Speaker 1: How does Homeland Security [U.S. Department of Homeland Security], I guess, interface with what, what you do?  'Cause I, I could imagine people would come over under one pretext or may wanna stay and the government doesn't want 'em stay necessarily or I don't know.
Speaker 2: Most of the people who come as international visitor go back, they want to go back.  But Homeland Security is much more rigorous I guess in or the state department [U.S. Department of State] in, in issuing visas for these individuals to come.  So sometimes visitors are invited but they can't come because their visa has not been issued in the country that they're coming from.  That has impacted on some of the people coming or but we find it a little more difficult to get through airports (laughter) because of the, the screenings, the security, and again it sort of depends on where the visitor is from.  Sometimes we go through security with no problems, other times we're stopped and are searched, secondary security, our bags are searched, we are searched, it sort of depends.  But, you know, it's supposed to be random, random checks so it's not just, just us but it could be any American citizen or other citizen that is stopped going through the airports.  But it just requires our getting to the airport early (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to go through security.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there, is there a good story from all these experiences?  Now, how, how, how long have you done this from 1980 until--
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty [1980] to now.  Eighty [1980] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's twenty-five years, yeah?
Speaker 2: Twenty, yeah, twenty-six years.  Oh, I don't know, there are lots of probably interesting stories.  Most of the people who come, I mean, are such excellent visitors and good representatives from their countries.

Speaker 1: I will mention that I took out, took off for maybe a year and a half because I was the director of the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History [Association for the Study of African American Life and History].
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, that's right, you, you were the executive director of the association (unclear).
Speaker 1: ASALH, yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah, now, what, what year was that, that was--
Speaker 1: That was from December of 1990 to probably March of '92 [1992].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that was a very satisfying time.  It was not an easy time but it was very satisfying in that it made me even more aware of the capabilities that I had.  The association when I went there had not had a director for about five months so there were lots of things that needed to be done.  And the conferences, the year, yearly conference was taking place in Washington [D.C.] at the same time.  And so, and the staff was very small just me and an assistant.  But there were lots of things that took place during that what, 15, 16 month period that had not been done for a while so I was able to put certain things into place, tidy up loose ends.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I know at one time the, the association published Negro History Bulletin [Black History Bulletin], I don't think that's out, did that---
Speaker 1: The Negro History Bulletin, yes.  Apparently it had been published, when I went there it had been published but it was never sent out.  I mean, this was one of the tasks, one of the loose ends that I--
Speaker 2: So, so something happened administratively to kind of stall the organization at one point?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  The organization has had its problem.  And when I was talking to the one person and told her I was the new executive director, she says oh, is that still in existence, I thought it was a (unclear) organization.  And no, it was not but it had had its problems over the years.  And so I found copies that had been printed that had never been mailed out so one of the things I was responsible for doing was to mail them out to the individuals who were members of the association.  Updated the mailing list, had a volunteer who was our computer guru, we got a free printer from his company that he worked with.  Had a volunteer who offered her services to put together the library that had once been functioning but it was no longer functioning.
Speaker 2: 'Cause there is a headquarters here [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 1: There is a headquarters here, yes.  It was down at 14th [Street] and Rhode Island Avenue.
