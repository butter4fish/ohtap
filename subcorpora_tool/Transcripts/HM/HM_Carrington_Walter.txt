Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth, there are five lightweight, People magazine-ish type questions that management compels me to ask everyone (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 1: And they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: The first question is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I would guess right now, probably my favorite food is a Nigerian dish, which my wife [HistoryMaker Dr. Arese Carrington] prepares, jollof rice.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: I would guess, well I suppose I should say, I should say crimson, which is the Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] colors, but actually I guess my favorite color is blue, and I say that with some reluctance since that's the color of our r- archrival, Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut].
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: I, I think spring is, is, is probably my, my favorite season.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: (Pause) I would, yeah, I would guess Paris [France].
Speaker 1: Okay, and the last question is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I do.  Let me see, I'm trying to think, I have several favorite things, but I would guess maybe my favorite one that I've often used, said to myself over the years, is the one from Shakespeare's [William Shakespeare], from 'Julius Caesar' when Cassius says, "The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves" and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --that would be, I think.
Story_ID: 421293
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Walter R. Carrington] side of the family, but we'll start with your mother's side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yeah, her full name is Marjorie Irene and her maiden name was Hayes [Marjorie Hayes Carrington].
Speaker 1: Okay, how do you spell that?
Speaker 2: H-A-Y-E-S.
Speaker 1: Okay, Marjorie, M-A-J-O-R-I-E (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) M-A-J-O-R-I-E, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: No, yeah, M-A-R-J-O-R--yeah.
Speaker 1: A-R, okay, right.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Oh boy, September 27th, what year, I think probably around 1906 or something like that, I would guess, but I'm not--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I don't remember the year but, yeah, the date was September 27th.
Speaker 1: That's in the ballpark--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that's good enough.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Sumter, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, that's S-U-M-T-E-R, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, S, S-U-M-P-T-E-R [sic.], Sumter.
Speaker 1: Okay, Sumter, South Carolina.  Now, what do you know about, well, how far back can you trace the ancestors on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: Not really very far.  I mean, I've never really tried to, to trace the ancestry.  You know, I've not been big on genealogy.  I've always been more interested in, in what's ahead rather than, you know, looking back at the family's history.  So you know, so I, so I really don't, you know, don't know much about my ancestors, you know, beyond my, my grandmother [Annie Durant].
Speaker 1: Okay, now there's, are there any stories about slavery or Reconstruction or any of that in your family?
Speaker 2: No, not that I can, not that I, not that I recall, no, no, my grandmother never really, never really talked much about that and, I, you know, no, I--that part of it I, you know, I, I don't really have any s- any memory of, really.
Speaker 1: Okay, or, well what did the ancestors on your mother's side do, I mean, for a living?  What, as far as you know?
Speaker 2: Well, well, you know, I, again, in terms of, of South Carolina, I don't know.  You know, my grandmother came here to Boston [Massachusetts] in the, in the 1920s and she, she worked as a domestic.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, I take it your mother came up with her?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Is there, is there a story as to how they, you know, why they chose Boston and, and, and were there relatives here already or did something happen in South Carolina (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, well, yeah well, yeah, there were relatives.  My, my grandmother's twin sister lived in a, in a town, Winchester [Massachusetts], which is not too far from here, and her, and her other sister, another sister, lived, in fact, here in Newton [Massachusetts] where we are now.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, members of the family were already settled in, in Boston (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, they were already settled in the area, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and I know it probably seems axiomatic, but, you know, was there a reason why that, as far as you know, as to why they moved to the North?
Speaker 2: No, I'm not sure.  Well, I think, like most blacks from the South, looking, looking for, for better opportunities, looking for, for more freedom and, you know, and the fact that two of her sisters were already here, I think, was a, was a magnet for her.
Story_ID: 421294
Speaker 1: When did your mother [Marjorie Hayes Carrington]--did she finish school here in Boston [Massachusetts] or did she go to New York [New York] first or what?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, she met my, my father [Walter R. Carrington] in, in New York.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she moved from Boston to New York?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I was, I was born there but then they came back to Boston.  In fact, I mean I came, you know, I was the first, or I was the first child and they came back here to Boston when I was two months old.  So, you know, for all practical purposes, you know, I'm really a native of this area.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Okay, all right.  Now, did your mother have anything to say about growing up?  Did she pass along any stories about that or--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I, I think the, you know, the usual kinds of stories about, about problems, discrimination and such.  It was my [maternal] grandmother [Annie Durant] who, I think, I remember my, my grandmother was always, always would be telling me, "Don't, you should not be, you should not trust these white kids, they will always turn on you," and all this kind of stuff.  You know, she would tell me all these stories when I was a kid because where I grew up, I grew up in Everett [Massachusetts], which is a small working class town just outside of Boston and I grew up in an area which was mostly Italian and Irish and there are relatively few, few black families in Everett, but Everett was a place where there was no segregation in the sense that fam- the black families were scattered all--there was about fifty black families, I guess, they were scattered all, all around the city.  I mean, they, you know, there was no, there wasn't any cluster.  In fact, the Urban League [National Urban League], I remember someone telling me at the time, had done a study of Everett back in the 1930s, a study of towns and found it to be the most integrated town of its size because, you know, there, there just was no, no black area.  And so, you know, most of the kids I grew up with and knew were Italian and Irish.  In fact, I often tell the story that I could speak--no, I first learned to, I could, I first learned to swear in Italian before I could swear in English.  I used to swear in Italian with a good Sicilian accent.  In fact when I saw, I don't know if you ever saw the movie, green--'Mean Streets' by Martin Scorsese, for me, that was like seeing 'Roots' because I, you know, I knew all, you know, all these, all these guys I knew.  You know, I mean, you know, all the things they did.  I mean, you know, were the kinds of things I did, you know, grow, growing up in that area so I, you know, you know, these Italian kids and the, and you know, and the way in which they interacted I, I knew, you know, I used to play bocce on Sunday which was the Italian game, even, even I pressed grapes with my feet, you know, so, it was a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I heard once that a woman called into WBEZ Radio in Chicago [Illinois] when there was a discussing--discussion on race.  She called in, she was from Sicily [Italy] and she said that she could remember during her lifetime, when she first came to America, that Sicilians weren't considered white.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, oh yeah, oh yeah, no, I know they weren't, yeah, I know.  They weren't at all, no, and in fact the Sicilians were really on the lower ladder even among the Italians, you know.  The Sicilians were, were down here but, you know, these, these were the kids I grew up with.
Speaker 1: Yeah, she said it changed during her lifetime, really--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) they were actually considered white all of a sudden.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: But, yeah, interesting.  So, well can you--now did your mother have a, have the opportunity to go to school and, and finish high school or college or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, see, I'm the first one in my family to, to finish, to finish high school.  Neither my mother nor my, nor my father finished, finished high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I was, I was really the first in the family to do so.
Story_ID: 421295
Speaker 1: Now can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Walter Randolph Carrington [Walter R. Carrington].
Speaker 1: Now, and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born in Barbados and f- his date, his year would be around, probably around 1904, I guess, something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, what do you know about your father's ancestors or--?
Speaker 2: Well, his father, who had the great name Richard Augustus Carrington [Richard Carrington (ph.)], they migrated from Barbados to Guyana, which, which was then known as British Guiana, and that's, that's where he grew up and then they came to the, to the states and to, to New York [New York].  He and, he had two brothers, no he had, let me see, yeah, he, yeah, he had, well, I guess he had one brother and three sisters and they, along with, with his mother, my grandmother, on my father's side, and they settled down in New York in Brooklyn.
Speaker 1: Okay, so are there any stories from that side of the family about life in Barbados or Guyana?
Speaker 2: No, most of the stuff from, from that side of the family has to do with Africa and that's when I first, when I first learned about Africa.  One of my father's sisters married a fellow who, and they, who was also from, from the West Indies, they went to Nigeria to work on the, on the railroad there.  He worked on the railroad, and in fact five of my cousins were born in Nigeria, and when I used to go visit them in the summers, you know, they would, the guys would, you know, would tell me, try to tell me all these scary stories about Africa and, you know, greatly embellished in which they would, they would tell me how they used to fight lions and tigers and all this kind of stuff and, of course, I found out later there were no tigers in Africa and there weren't likely to be any lions around the capital, you know, the capital city of Lagos [Nigeria] where they were living but they, well after, after, they came back just before the outbreak of the Second World War [World War II, WWII] and after the end of the war, when the United Nations [UN] was formed, and Nigerians and people from other places in Africa would come to the United Nations making their, making their case for independence, and so I met a lot of those people early on when I used, used to go down in the summers because I spent a lot of summers in New York visiting them. And so, that was my first, sort of, sort of acquaintance, acquaintance with Nigeria.  Nigeria was really the first foreign country I really knew much about and as I say, I met a lot of the early leaders who used to come through their house in, in Brooklyn.
Speaker 1: Okay, well who were some of the leaders that came through?
Speaker 2: Well, there was K.O. Mbadiwe, who was, who was one of the early ones.  I'm trying to think some of the--well, Azikiwe [Nnamdi Azikiwe] who became the first president of Nigeria.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Nnamdi Azikiwe.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and a number of others who, you know, I can't remember, I can't recall all the names but I used, but you know I met a lot of these folks.
Speaker 1: Were they primarily Nigerians?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, these are Nigerians that I'm talking about because they, you know, they knew my uncle from the time when he was in Nigeria.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, you know, I met them and then--
Speaker 1: Yeah, this, yeah, I know before we started the interview, we mentioned William Leo Hansberry, and, I know he had a project called the African Institute or Africa House [sic. The African-American Institute; The Africa-America Institute] in D.C. [sic. New York, New York] where they, a lot of the students would come through (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, come through it, right.
Speaker 1: --and stay.  Yeah, I know Azikiwe was one of his--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, right.
Speaker 1: --proteges or someone that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, Zik studied in, at Lincoln [Lincoln University, Lincoln University, Pennsylvania] as did Kwame Nkrumah, they both got their degrees from Lincoln.  So, you know, so it was really, you know, from my family, on my father's side that I, that I first really got interested in, in Africa.
Story_ID: 421296
Speaker 1: Let me ask you now, did your father talk about growing up, about what growing up was like for him and what he did?
Speaker 2: No, well, my father and mother [Marjorie Hayes Carrington] divorced when I was rather young, and my father lived in New York [New York] for a while and then I guess in the, in the f- sometime in the '40s [1940s], he went off to the West Coast and lived in, first in Oregon and then in, and then in California and I would sometime see him in New York, I'd be in New York, he might come, you know, come back, you know, to, to visit, but my father was, was very active in the, in the early civil rights movements out there on the West Coast.  In fact I was reading, I was doing some research recently and came across, he's, I was doing the, I was reading some stuff from the papers of Clarence Mitchell [Clarence M. Mitchell, Jr.], you know, who was the NAACP'S [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] man in Washington [D.C.] and Clarence Mitchell, in his early days, was a staff member on the FEPC commission [Fair Employment Practices Committee] in Washington that Roosevelt [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] had set up and he tells about my father because my father led the efforts at the Kaiser Shipyards to integrate the Kaiser Shipyards and to get black workers their equal pay with whites and he led that fight and came down to Washington, testified before the FEPC, and I remember my father sending me a newspaper, he would send me newspapers all the time and the black paper there had these big headlines, Walter Carrington [Walter R. Carrington] fired, you know, they fired him in the civil rights thing and then later sent me one where he was, where he was, was rehired and where, you know, and they won the case.  So, you know, I got a sort of very early indoctrination into, into the civil rights struggle, really through, through the work my father was doing.
Story_ID: 421297
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about your parents' [Marjorie Hayes Carrington and Walter R. Carrington] personalities and tell us who do you, who you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Well, that's a good question.  In terms of who I take after most, I'm not sure I, it's probably an amalgamation probably of the, of the two of them.  Of course, you know, I was much, I was more influenced growing up by my mother, well even more than my mother by my [maternal] grandmother [Annie Durant] because we really lived with my grandmother right up through the time I went to, went to, left high school [Everett High School, Everett, Massachusetts], yeah, finished high school and went to college [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  So, we lived in my grandmother's house in, in Everett [Massachusetts].  My mother lived in Boston [Massachusetts] and she remarried but in terms of who I, who I most take after, it's, it's difficult to, it's difficult to say.  I would, that's a good question.  You know, I think there are characteristics of my grandmother, my mother and my father, I guess, in, in me, you know.  I'm trying to separate which, you know, which I most resemble, it's hard to say (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, what was your, well what were they like?  Describe your mother and describe your father, I guess.
Speaker 2: Well, my, well I think both of them were very, very assertive, very assertive people and were people who never saw injustice that they would not, they would not try to right.  My mother, for example, she died in her, in her eighties and up until the time she died, she was still, she worked as a waitress in Boston and was very, and was active in the union and I remember, I, I came back from Washington [D.C.], I was up here teaching at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] for a semester and I remember her calling me one night and asking me to come over and help her make some picket signs and, you know, she was close in age, you know, she was going on the picket line, I mean, even then, you know, so she was always very active, and unlike my, you know, my, my grandmother came up in the days of, when most, all blacks were Republicans and so she was, she was a Republican.  My mother was, you know, was a, was a staunch Democrat and it was an interesting, interesting in seeing the difference between them but she was active right until the end and in fact, the thing that did her in was smoking and I think if she hadn't smoked, she'd be alive telling me, she was, you know, very, you know, she always looked much younger.  In fact, when I was a kid, we, you know, people used to think when I was, not a kid, when I was in college, you know, people thought she was my older sister or something, you know, that kind of thing but she always remained, remained active.  And, you know, in that sense was a great influence on me in terms of being an activist.
Speaker 1: And your father's the same, activist (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, my father was the same.  Well, just so you know, he, he was very active and brought one of the, one of the really early important cases before the FEPC [Fair Employment Practices Committee] in Washington when he was, when he was out in Oregon organizing black workers.
Story_ID: 421298
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: What would be the earliest childhood memory?  It's, I have, I have early childhood memories but I'm trying to think what the earliest would be.  I remember we used to go for Thanksgiving dinners over to my [maternal] grandmother's twin sister's house and her husband was from, my, her twin sister's husband was from somewhere, somewhere in the West Indies, I can't remember where, but they would have these really vigorous arguments.  I remember him, George [ph.], especially would have these arguments about the per- the perfidy of the British.  You know, how terrible they were and all of the things that they did in the colonialism and all of that, you know, and so I was learning this at a very, at a very early age.  You know, I may have been, you know, six or seven at the time when I, when I first heard that.  I'm trying to think of other early memories (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, you remember the arguments?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah.  No, I remember those discussions.
Speaker 1: I was trying to find the earliest one, I, you know, but that's, right now.  Is there anything earlier?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I'm trying to think what would be, what would be earlier than that.
Speaker 1: Does your memory start up at, what, three or four or five?
Speaker 2: I guess, yeah, I guess that's when one's memory starts, but I'm trying to think that what would go back to three or four?  What I would remember from, from then, boy.  (Laughter) Interesting.  I can't (pause) I, no, you know, I have some like vague memories.  In those days, sometimes you traveled up the coast by boat and I remember being, I remember doing that as a kid with my mother [Marjorie Hayes Carrington] but earlier than that, I just don't recall.  I remember once being, going to the theatre with my mother and her brother, my uncle, from whom where I got my middle name, Charles, and see, I remember the audience was making, making a lot of noise and something and singing, "Hold that tiger, hold that tiger," you know, a song that, you know, that was sort of the, like the first, remember about how old I was at the time I just, I just don't, don't know.  So, you know, memories from three, four years old, I'm not sure (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm much better with things from six years old on but not back that far--
Speaker 1: All right, okay, well, tell me--
Story_ID: 421299
Speaker 1: Well you lived in this integrated community [in Everett, Massachusetts]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) you were raised there from age, about what age?
Speaker 2: Well, from the age of two months.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right and was there, I know it's an integrated community but was there a name for the side of town you lived on or the place, or the--
Speaker 2: Well, interestingly enough, the area that I lived in was called monkey corner, and it had to do with, with Italians and I'm not sure it was named as derogatory by the Italians or about the fact that some of them involved criminal things and, you know, I've forgotten now the origins of it but it had nothing to do with black folk because there weren't any blacks around, you know, but it was called, it was called monkey corner, and it really had to do with the, with the Italians, with the Sicilians who, who lived in that area.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, yeah, I remember that from, you know, when I was very young but as the years went on that name sort of disappeared but it was, when I was, when I first started to go to school, I remember that.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Few people talking about that, yeah.
Story_ID: 421300
Speaker 1: You grew up at Everett, Massachusetts--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, the sights and sounds, well, it, as I say, it, it was a working class neighborhood and the, most of the people there, of course, you know, back, back in those days, the number of kids whose parents had, you know, had a high school education or, you know, were few and I don't think any of them had parents who had gone to college at that point when I was, when I was growing up in Everett.  I remember, you know, that, I'm trying to think in terms of early, early sorts of things, going, going to school, the, for the first four years there was a, the Hancock School [Everett, Massachusetts] was about a, was about a mile or two away and, you know, we had walked there, you know, every day, when busing didn't exist in those days, you know, you walked to school and walked back every day.
Speaker 1: Now, Hancock School, I suppose was named after John Hancock?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: Was it, did he have any special meaning for the town of Everett or--
Speaker 2: No, no, just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, just a general--
Speaker 2: --nothing, no, no, it was just, it was just, that was the school that we, that we went to and I, I was at the Hancock School, I think, there were two other blacks in my class.
Speaker 1: So did you go there from kindergarten through--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, yeah, well yeah, from--high scho- yeah, I went not to kindergarten, the kindergarten I remember, talking about early memories, yeah, I remember when I was five going to, going to kindergarten in the town next to us, Malden [Massachusetts], you know, when mother [Marjorie Hayes Carrington] would, my [maternal] grandmother [Annie Durant] would take me there morning and, you know, I'd spend the day there then home, but that, yeah, that was when I was, when I was five and then when I was six, I, you know, I went on to school, to the Hancock School and was there for, say for, for four years.
Speaker 1: Okay, for four years.  Okay, this is like through, through fourth grade?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, through, through the fourth grade.
Story_ID: 421301
Speaker 1: What would you say your personality was like when you were growing up in--?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think I was, I was rather, rather shy, rather introverted.  Well, not, not completely introverted, but, you know, I was, I was not the kind of kid, you know, who, you know, who would walk into a room of, you know, of strangers and, you know, and immediately sort of glad-hand everybody.  You know, I was, you know, I was, I was, I was reserved when I was, when I was growing up.
Speaker 1: Now, what did your household consist of?  Now, you were in Everett [Massachusetts] and you said your [maternal] grandmother [Annie Durant] was there, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was my grandmother--
Speaker 1: So, it's your mother [Marjorie Hayes Carrington]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, my mother and my uncle did not, well, my uncle lived there part of the time.  My mother, as I said, was in, was in Boston [Massachusetts] and so there was my sister [Marilyn Carrington] and I and my, and my grandmother who, who lived in the house in Everett.
Story_ID: 421302
Speaker 1: Did you like school when you started attending school (Simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I loved it.  I loved it.  I, from, from, from early on, I, I liked school.  I liked reading, you know, so that school was, you know, was a great, was a great pleasure for me and the four years that I spent at, at the Hancock School [Everett, Massachusetts], you know, where I was sort of, you know, socializing, you know, and getting, getting socialized, was, was a very important part of my life, you know, and I, I had a lot of friends and, but I remember the first, I guess the first time when I was ever aware of sort of being different or discrimination because, because I was black, I guess this must have, it probably didn't happen when I was in the, at the Hancock, but it may have happened a little later when I was a little bit older, probably was around ten or eleven, or twelve, I remember going to a, to a party, to a party at the home of one of the girls in the class, a white girl in the class, and I remember overhearing her mother asking her whether or not there was any black girl coming, you know because--and sort of telling her, you know, that how awkward it was, you know, that I, you know, that I was, you know, that I was the only, you know, that I was there and there were these white girls, you know, they really should have had a black girl there for me (laughter) and, you know, and I, that kind of, that kind of registered on me and I, you know, I began to realize, you know, how, you know, some of the, some of the kind of social limitations that, that existed.  So that, you know, while I had, while I had friends, et cetera, et cetera, you know, the idea of going to a dance or something and dancing with a, you know, with someone who was white would, you know, would be frowned upon by the parents not, you know, not so much by the, by my classmates, but by the, by the parents.

Speaker 1: That was sort of my first kind of inkling of that, but, you know, it was very interesting, I, as I say, went, went to school for twelve years in, in Everett [Massachusetts], and never really ran into a, into a case of, of discrimination until, well, well, with one exception, which I'll come back to, until I went off to college [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and I remember my freshman year, in Cambridge [Massachusetts], my roommate, who as I said was black, he and I went into a famous shop in Harvard Square [Cambridge, Massachusetts], they had a pool table upstairs, and we went up and played pool 'cause that, you know, I always fancied myself a great pool player, and we went up there and after we finished playing pool, the owner came over to us and said, "You know, I didn't say anything to you now, you know, but you're really not welcome to come here and play pool," you know, and as a result of that, I, I organized my first strike.  We got students to picket the place, but, but growing up in Everett, I never, I don't recall that kind of incid- the one, the one thing, the one day when I was, when I really felt part, you know, not part of the sort of general culture there, was on Sundays because the churches were the most, you know, discriminating, you know--
Speaker 2: They called it the most segregated hour--
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, the most segregated hour was, was the--
Speaker 2: Church.
Speaker 1: --was the church hour.  Now this, this was not true for the Catholic churches because blacks were Catholics.  You know, went to, went to the Masses and everything in the Catholic church, okay, but the Protestant churches were strict- strictly segregated and so I would go every Sunday, the family would go every Sunday, to the next town, Malden [Massachusetts], where the, where the black church was.  And so, you know, that, so Sunday was really my black day (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, did you have a, were the movie theatres integrated?  Did you have to sit (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: So you didn't have to worry about sitting in the balcony or anything or--
Speaker 1: No, no, as they say, you know, I never, I never ran into, to anything in any kind of public place, et cetera that, you know, where I was treated any different or from, from my white friends or f- even feared that, that that might happen.
Story_ID: 421304
Speaker 1: You know, movies, every place I wanted to go (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 1: Yeah well I guess my favorite subject in, and I guess I really got into it more in the upper grades was, was history.  History was always my favorite subject and, in fact, it was what I majored in when I was in, when I was in college.
Speaker 2: Okay, now you were, you were at Hancock [Hancock School, Everett, Massachusetts] for four years and then where, you know, where (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, then I went to the, to the Hale School [Everett, Massachusetts] 'cause Hancock went for four years and the Hale School was for the fifth and sixth grades and I, I went there for two--and then went from there to, to the Parlin junior high school [Albert N. Parlin School, Everett, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, what's the name?
Speaker 1: Parlin, P-A-R-L-I-N.
Speaker 2: Parlin, okay.
Speaker 1: That was named for one of the sort of benefactors in Everett [Massachusetts] who, a guy who gave a lot of money for education and all of that and so the school was, was named for him and then, and then went onto high school [Everett High School, Everett, Massachusetts] for four years.  So, now as I say, I don't, you know--
Speaker 2: Were there any teachers that were like mentors to you or had a special interest for you?
Speaker 1: Well, in high school, you know, one of the interesting things at the time, I used to hear these stories from, you know, from some of my black friends and I'd read about it in the black papers, the complaints that guidance counselors would often try to shunt the black students off into vocational things and all that kind of thing and did, and didn't encourage them, et cetera.  And I had just the opposite of, opposite experience.  The guy who was, who was the guidance counselor, you know, really, really pushed me to go onto college and to go onto the, you know, to the best college that, you know, was.  And so, you know, he was very, very helpful to me and very, and very encouraging to me and he said, you know, that, 'cause I was thinking of going off to the University of Massachusetts and they said, ah, you don't want that.  He said, you really should go to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and--
Speaker 2: Now you must have had exceptional grades?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I did, yeah I did well in school.
Speaker 2: Were you the only black student doing that well or did the others--
Speaker 1: Let's see, there was a, there was a girl, Edith Yancy [ph.] who, who did well.  I'm not, but I don't know if she, I'm not sure where she went off to school but, yeah, I was sort of, you know, near, near the top of my, of my class in terms of academics.
Story_ID: 421305
Speaker 1: The interesting thing is that when I was, when I was growing up, I had a really bad stutter when I was a kid, and I was always sort of uncomfortable sometimes in public because of the stutter, and then when I was in junior high school [Albert N. Parlin School, Everett, Massachusetts], we had a debate team and a debate was coming up and one of the kids who was on the team got sick and couldn't take part and so I volunteered and a lot of my friends sort of laughed, you know, said, "You can't get up there and debate," and so forth.  And I found that once when I got on a stage, I was a different person.  The, no stutter, nothing and, in fact, I mean, the usual stereotype of black guys is, you know, that they are great in athletics, you know, and they make their name in athletics.  I made my name in high school [Everett High School, Everett, Massachusetts] through debating and public speaking and so, you know, this is what I, you know, what, what I did.  And so I, you know, I became, you know, one of the most popular guys at the, at the school.  I was vice president of my class all four years at, at high school. And, as I say, you know, and used to win the public speaking prizes every year and the debating things and the highlight of the debating was when we debated Boston Latin high school [Boston Latin School, Boston, Massachusetts] and Boston Latin is regarded as probably the best high school, not only in Massachusetts but maybe in the country, and, and we beat them, and, you know, that was a great, a great day and, again, my public speaking got me involved in, you know, not only in school politics but we used to have something at the State House [Massachusetts State House, Boston, Massachusetts] every year called, Good, Good Government Day [Student Government Day], in which high school students would take over the roles of various people, you know, and I ran for the, for the House of Representatives [Massachusetts House of Representatives] and I, and so I was elected as the Everett [Massachusetts] representative, you know, to be in the House of Representatives and I remember getting up there and proposing a resolution calling for the, for the lowering of the voting age to eighteen and got a lot of publicity in the papers, you know, because of that and so forth and that, again, was very good (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In those days it was twenty-one, I guess, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, it was twenty-one, and one of the issues that I debated, you know, that we debated was a very popular issue at the time was the question of lowering the voting age, you know, under the theory that if the, if you're old enough to fight, you're old enough to vote, you know, because at eighteen you were drafted into the [U.S.] Army.  So--
Speaker 2: So this is in what, 1948?
Speaker 1: Yeah, '48 [1948] was--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --is when I graduated, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: The Korean War's going on.
Speaker 1: No, the Korean War didn't start until 1950.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, this is before the Kore- this is before the Korean War but at the beginning really of the, of the Cold War, because I remember when we were registering, all my, all us guys were saying to one another, you know, see you in Siberia, you know, because we all thought that we were going to war with Russia, you know, and that our generation would be the ones that would be, you know, that would be drafted.  We were turning eighteen so forth, so.
Story_ID: 421306
Speaker 1: Now what did you think, now you were in high school [Everett High School, Everett, Massachusetts] when several milestones occurred, I mean, Jackie Robinson, Major League Baseball [MLB]---
Speaker 2: Um-hm, about '47 [1947], yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) I guess 1947, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Forty-eight [1948], Truman [President Harry S. Truman] integrated the [U.S.] Armed Forces, I believe.
Speaker 2: Right, um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, now I think that earlier, A. Philip Randolph, Randolph, had threatened to march on Washington [D.C.], it was called that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, yeah, that was back in, during the war [World War II, WWII].  That was in--
Speaker 1: That was in '43 [1943]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, '43 [1943], I think it was.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  What was your, did your family discuss politics and stuff--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, oh yeah--
Speaker 1: --activist family, I guess you were pretty young.
Speaker 2: --yeah, oh yeah, and I used to, I used to read all the black newspapers, the Pittsburgh Courier [New Pittsburgh Courier], I read religiously every week, the, the Afro-American [Afro-American Newspapers] and then we had, we had a local paper, the, well we had two, the Boston Guardian and the Boston Chronicle that I read, read all the time.  So, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now the Boston Guardian that was William Monroe Trotter's paper--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, that--
Speaker 1: The one he started with?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was the one he started, but when I was growing up, by that time, the Chronicle was, you know, had really surpassed it and it was edited by a black guy who had graduated from Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Bill, oh wow, but the name s- it'll come, Harrison, yeah, William Harrison, and he and I got to be quite friendly and when I was in college [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], he, you know, his paper gave me a lot of ink.
Speaker 1: Okay, William Harrison's Boston Chronicle.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now did, was radio significant when you were growing up?  In other words, what did TV add (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, no, no, radio was very, well you talk about TV, the first time I saw a TV was the day, I'm not sure, it was the day I graduated or, from high school, was very close there because I remember coming back from one of the celebrations and seeing on the porch of one of my neighbors, he had his television set.  The first time, the first time I'd seen a television, this was 1948, you know, and he was sort of like the first on the block to get a television, so we all, all gathered around.  In those days, you know, television screens were round, you know, and--
Speaker 1: The body was this long, was a foot long.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, and everything was black and white and so forth, and but yeah, but, no radio was, was very, was very important.  I used to listen to the radio all the time.
Story_ID: 421307
Speaker 1: And I was very interested in politics.  I mean, I would stay up late at night listening to the, to the conventions on the radio.  I remember the Republican convention [1940 Republican National Convention, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] with Wendell Willkie and Roosevelt [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt], there was a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now was your, were your people Republicans or--
Speaker 1: Well, my, my--
Speaker 2: --your mother [Marjorie Hayes Carrington] and your [maternal] grandmother [Annie Durant] were.
Speaker 1: --my grandmother was.  In fact--
Speaker 2: She was a Republican, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, she was, as a matter of fact I remember going to the polls with her when I was six years old and for the 19- she was going to vote in 1936 for Alf Landon against Roosevelt and I was sitting in the rumble seat of the car, I remember that very well.  And then I remember the 1940 election because I was, I was a Republican at that time and 'cause, because politics in my area really had a lot to do with religion.  All the Catholic kids were Democrats and all the Protestant kids (laughter) were Republicans pretty much and I remember, when I was at the, at the Hale School [Everett, Massachusetts], getting into a fight in the schoolyard because one of the kids came up to me and said something about, about Wendell Willkie saying, "The horse's tail is very silky, lift it up and you'll see Willkie." (Laughter) And so, we got, I never forgot that and we got into a fight over that.  It's just amazing, you know (laughter).  You know, there were some things you hear that you just, you just never forget (laughter), but, yeah, the, the Catholic kids, the Irish and the Italians were all very strongly Democrat and the Protestants, and most blacks at the time around, you know, were probably going to, although they were beginning to change.  Roosevelt was, was changing them.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, now were, were black politics debated on the radio at all?  I mean, were there any radio shows where black people actually talked about issues and--
Speaker 1: No, well, you know, you kind of, the black population then was very small in this area.  I think the City of Boston [Massachusetts], at its height when I was growing up, may have, it may have reached 6 percent but that was, that was at its height, but the first black elected, at least during my time, to the House of Representatives, came from the neighboring town of Malden [Massachusetts], Herb Jackson [Herbert L. Jackson], and he was Republican.
Speaker 2: What was his name again, Herb--
Speaker 1: I think it was, I'm trying to remember.  I think it was Herb, Herb Jackson, I think was his name (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, and he was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives?
Speaker 1: Yeah, from, and he, he lived in Malden, which meant that, you know, he had to have a lot of, you know, white votes and he had, I mean the overwhelming majority of votes had, you know, had to come from whites.
Story_ID: 421308
Speaker 1: In terms of the radio and so forth, no the blackest thing for me on the radio was listening to, to jazz and music and Symphony Sid, you know, he was not black but he'd, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, now you're the second person to mention him.
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh yeah, Symphony Sid--
Speaker 2: Symphony Sid, yeah.
Speaker 1: --was the guy, oh yeah.  He was the one who played all the music.  He was not black, but he was, you know, he was the guy who, you know, who helped to keep that music popular.
Speaker 2: So he wasn't black, he was--
Speaker 1: No, no, he wasn't black, he was white.
Speaker 2: Okay, he's a white guy.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but Symphony Sid, yeah.
Speaker 2: Did he play, like, black and Latino music, that's what I've heard?
Speaker 1: Not Latino, black.
Speaker 2: Black, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh yeah, black.  Jazz, blues, all that.
Speaker 2: But his name was Symphony Sid (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was called Symphony Sid, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, he was, he was very, very popular, very famous.  I think, I think he came out, I think he was in New York [New York] that, you know, but, you know, his shows were broadcast and, you know, listened to it every, you know, listened to it at night and, you know, he was, he was a great influence and, you know, in terms of hearing all that music.  And I was very interested in it because I, I used to make some extra money on weekends working as a, as a disc jockey with a black guy in Everett [Massachusetts] who used to have these, what they call record hops, you know, in towns like Medford [Massachusetts] and so forth where there were more blacks, you know, and so I would help him pick out the music and, you know, and I would play, you know, I would, would play the music and so forth at these things.
Speaker 2: Okay, now who would they play at record hops in the late '40s [1940s], like--
Speaker 1: Who would, who would come to the record hops?
Speaker 2: No who would be there?  Some of the music, I meant, the musicians (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well the music, well it was--
Speaker 2: The musicians.
Speaker 1: --you know, it was--
Speaker 2: What do they call it swing then or--
Speaker 1: Oh, well, blues, Wynonie Harris and people, people like that.  Let's see, I can't, I can't remember all the names, but yeah, but all of those, all of those artists of the early '40s [1940s], you know, we--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --we used to play all those, all those records.  I can't think, I'm trying to think of some of the names of the, but, yeah, and when the new records came out, you know, of course Nat King Cole was getting popular then.  Ella Fitzgerald.
Story_ID: 421309
Speaker 1: Now did you have a decent social life in high school [Everett High School, Everett, Massachusetts]?  Were there enough (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, well, again, you know, as I say, I was, I was not the most aggressive guy in going after, in going after girls.  I, I remember my, my junior prom, there was a very beautiful young black girl at the school, she was a couple of grades behind me, but when I dated, I dated her and then this other girl who was in my class, but, you know, I was not, I see my wife [HistoryMaker Dr. Arese Carrington] listening very carefully (laughter), but I was, no, I was not, you know, I was not a big lady's man at that, you know, in those days.  As again, you know, I said I was kind of shy then but, you know, I went, you know, was involved in, you know, in all the social things that went on at school and so on (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, so you were vice president of the class, as you said?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now--
Story_ID: 421310
Speaker 1: Come your senior year, here you are, and you said your parents [Marjorie Hayes Carrington and Walter R. Carrington], neither one of your parents ever graduated from high school, but you're getting ready to graduate from high school [Everett High School, Everett, Massachusetts] and thinking about going to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --now is that, I mean, how did they feel about that?
Speaker 2: Oh great.  I mean, my mother, you know, also pushed me, you know, for Harvard.  I had been accepted at Rutgers [Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey] and I wanted to go there, you know, and I wanted to go to Rutgers because of Paul Robeson, you know.  There was a book by Earl Schenck Miers called 'Big Ben,' which was a book written for kids about Robeson which I had read as a kid and, you know, Robeson was sort of my hero.  I mean, I used to get, you know, his records, not only his singing records but his speaking, I mean, one of the things that I really was impressed was his speaking, you know, when he played Othello and all of that kind of thing.  So Robeson was a great hero and I got accepted at Rutgers, and I remember one of my closest friends, an Italian kid, who was unsure where he was going to go to school, I said, "You know, why don't you come to Rutgers?"  He had never heard of Rutgers.  And so he said, "Okay great," you know.  So he applied, he got accepted and then I remember at a, at one of our school assemblies, a fellow from Harvard came out to speak, and this was, this was rather late in the school year, it was sort of like in March or something, and he came to speak and I went up to see him afterwards and I said, you know, "Gee, you know, I really liked what you had to say about Harvard," and so forth.  I said, you know, "Is it too late to apply?"  And he, you know, and he asked me some questions, well what would you like to, and he said, "No, you ought to apply."  And, again, he, like my counselor, like my guidance counselor, was very influential on that and he, he told me apply, you know.  I had to take the, you know, I was going to take the, what was then the SATs, I've forgotten what they were called then, the college entry exam, or something (unclear) and it was coming over the, at just about the time we're having our senior prom.  And so, I, and so I decided to give up the senior prom and all that to, you know, to study for the, for the exam.  And so, I took the exam and got accepted.  And so I went to Harvard (laughter) and my poor friend went off to Rutgers by himself.  And, you know, it was very interesting in terms of dynamics because you asked about what my parents thought, it was my friends who were really, shucks, they thought that I was abandoning them, you know, because Harvard had this very elitist sort of, sort of reputation, you know, and, you know, and they thought that Harvard, you know, looked down upon them and these, these kids, a lot of them, you know, were these poor white kids from, you know, in the vocational--in fact, but they were among my, my strongest political supporters in high school, you know, they were the ones that, you know, and they were now thinking, you know, and I remember one of them saying, you know, "I hope you're not going to forget us," you know, I hope that, you know, you'll still come back and be friends and so will you, because going off to Harvard was, seemed as, really, you know, as almost going into another dimension.
Story_ID: 420973
Speaker 1: Were you aware, I know you were aware of Robeson's [Paul Robeson] having gone to Rutgers [Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey], were you aware of Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois] at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and some of the other, some of the other black history at Harvard (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes, yeah, I mean--
Speaker 1: Like Trotter [William Monroe Trotter] went there, I think, too.
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --yeah.  Again, you know as I say, I read, you know, the, the black papers religiously and so forth and, you know, and then I would get, you know, we would get, get into these, into these discussions, you know, whenever sort of getting together with the extended family, you know, and all of these things would come up.  So, you know, so I was, I was very aware of all that and, you know, and was sort of inspired by them and this is, you know, what sort of drove me to really become active in this sort of thing.  The interesting thing about growing up at that time in Everett [Massachusetts], in Eastern Massachusetts was, I think, it mainly, it may have been a result of the fact that the black population was so small that Boston [Massachusetts] and Eastern Massachusetts then was probably one of the most liberal areas for blacks.  The great problem in terms of discrimination and prejudice at that time was anti-Semitism.  It, you know, it was very interesting to me, you know, talk about early, early memories because this was when I was maybe about ten, but, one of the most vehement things that I remember was we had a candy store on the corner that we used to always go to run by a guy named Mr. Goodman [ph.] and he was Jewish and he had a son, Stanley [ph.], and Stanley really never sort of hung out with us.  The, you know, the, most of these kids were Roman Catholic and, you know, had this idea of Jews as Christ killers and all that kind of stuff, you know, so, and I remember one day--'cause, you know, every Saturday we'd go off to the movies and one day I went to the movies with Stanley.  Stanley and I went to the movies together and I remember coming back, you know, after coming back from the movies, was sitting on the, on some steps and this Italian kid, Victor, I forget, Victor Lozzi [ph.], looked at me and said, you know, "I hear you went to the movies with Stanley, you know, you're hanging out with Stanley?"  I said, "Yeah, he's a nice guy," you know, blah, blah.  And he said, "Well, you know he's a Jew?" And I looked at him, I said, "Yeah," and so he went on and on and (unclear) things and you could see he wasn't getting through to me.  And so finally, and I'll never forget this 'til the day I die, he says vehemently, he looks at me vehemently and said, "Do you want your sister [Marilyn Carrington] to marry a Jew?"  (Laughter) I, you know, and it was just a vehement, you know, I didn't understand the significance of it at the time but it was, you know, the vehemence was, with which he said it, you know.  "How would you like your sister to marry a Jew?"  You know, and, you know, so I, you know, I then became very aware of the whole question.  I said, and, in Malden [Massachusetts], the town next to us was, there was an area where there were a lot of Jewish families and we used to call, it used to refer to it as Jew town and, you know, the kids would go there, the guys would go there at, you know, at night, you know, and beat up the kids and all that, and all that kind of thing and I remember going with them once and then seeing what happens, you know, didn't go again but this was the kind of vehemence that existed.  They have the St. Patrick's Day parades every year and you'd have these kids from Newton [Massachusetts] and Brookline [Massachusetts], you know, the, the marching bands which were, and they were, you know, large Jewish population, and, you know, they would get beat up by these Irish kids, you know, it was just, it was that kind of, kind of thing that went on.
Story_ID: 420974
Speaker 1: As far as, as blacks were concerned, and race, you know, you heard the, you know, the term nigger was used, you know, a lot and you'd get into fights about it, but you were almost fighting more about the noun than the adjective, you know.  You know, they, you know, you were fighting more about the fact they called you a nigger or bastard, you know, the bastard part, you know, that kind of thing and--
Speaker 2: So the other part wasn't considered as bad, or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, well it was bad but, you know, that wasn't, you know, the vehement thing.
Speaker 2: Well, the usual, the other racial nicknames you used like dago or the--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, oh yeah, wop, oh yeah.
Speaker 2: --kike, and all that other, okay.
Speaker 1: Guinea, yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah.  You've heard all of these, all of these kinds of things, yeah.
Speaker 2: So all the ethnic pet names were used around the neighborhood [in Everett, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 1: And I guess, the most embarrassing thing growing up was that there were terms that we used so freely by people who would use them almost carelessly, you know, like for example, the numbers racket, you know, the numbers, you know, everybody used to play the numbers and they refer to it as a nigger pool, you know, and that was just what they always called it.  You'd go to Boston Garden [Boston, Massachusetts] and if you sat up in the rafters, that was called nigger heaven, you know, these white folks, you know, so, you know, and you'd just, unfortunately you get into arguments and so forth, you know, about that kind of thing and then they would, "Oh, we're sorry," this sort of thing.  And, you know, the shoe industry at that time was very big and a black guy had invented this way of sewing the shoes together and they referred to it as a nigger head laster (laughter) you know, that was, that was the thing.  You know, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the shoe last machine, the shoe last machine (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Is that Matzeliger, Jan Ernst Matzeliger?
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, yeah, and it was called, it was called the nigger head, you know, laster, so, you know, so you got into that kind of, into that kind of thing and so you'd hear these terms, you know, all the time but--
Speaker 2: I just wondered if, now tell me this, Italo-Ethiopian War [Second Italo-Ethiopian War] was going on, you know, and you have this Italian community, was there any dialogue about that when you were growing up?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, well (laughter), the dialogue, I remember when Joe Louis fought Primo Carnera, I mean, that was another great hero.  I mean, Joe Louis, you know, people, these kids would talk about, about Muhammad Ali as the greatest, you know, they don't think about Joe Louis and the effect that Joe Louis had for our generation.  He was just, it was just electric.  I mean, and so when, you know, when he fought, when he fought Primo Carnera, you know--
Speaker 2: Now he was an Italian--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --from, from Argentina [sic.], right?
Speaker 1: No, no from Italy.
Speaker 2: Was he from, was he (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I think, I think, let me see now.  I thought he was from Italy.  He may have been from Argentina, anyway but he was the hero of the Italians, you know, and, you know, so the next day I had bragging rights, you know (laughter), and I remember when he fought Billy Conn, he was this Irish, you know, guy, and again, you know, all the Irish, you know, were all, you know, pro-Conn, and you know and I was, of course--
Speaker 2: Pro-Conn.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yeah, yeah, you know, and I was Joe Louis, and I'll never forget the second Max Schmeling fight because a lot of the kids were going to come over to the house to listen to it on the radio, and they were late.  By the time they got there, you know, I told them, "Hey, the fight's over" (laughter) you know, 'cause he, you know, Joe knocked out Schmeling in, you know, in less than a minute, I guess.  It was certainly under two minutes, I wasn't exact, the exact time of that but, no, but Joe Louis was really, you know, the, a great hero growing up.  And so the, and you know, and at that time, of course, the war, the Italian war against Ethiopia was going on.  And so, this became almost a mythic fight, you know, the black, you know, against this, this Italian fighter who was representing the country that was, that was invading Ethiopia, you know.  So, you know, I remember all that, you know, very well and being caught up in all of that.

Speaker 1: On your way to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], did you have s- now have you had, you'd been to the campus before at this juncture (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, no, I had never, I had never been, you know, I had never seen it before, you know.
Speaker 1: Well how did it affect you?  I mean, did it live up to what you expected it to be when you got there?
Speaker 2: Well, interesting thing.  You know, I got there and after, you know, I get dropped off and so forth, then my roommate [HistoryMaker James M. Harkless] shows up, and he's black, and it turns out that there were four blacks in our class.  That was the largest number of blacks they ever had in the class and like Noah's Ark, they roomed us two by two.  So, again, this again was my first sort of experience of this kind of thing, you know, was sort of being segregated or at least roomed on a, you know, on the basis of race.  You know, that happened only in the freshman year, you know, after that, you know, you could room with whomever you want but the, I guess they, their excuse was that they wanted to, you know, avoid problems and all that kind of stuff and that incident led me to get very active and we formed an NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] chapter and I was the founding president and one of our main aims was to get the number of blacks admitted to Harvard increased, and also to change the situation of rooming blacks together because the next year, they had three blacks in the class and they put all three of them together in one room.  And so, you know, in those days, integration was, you know, was very much the progressive position. And, you know, that's why the world today is just so different in terms of, you know, black kids wanting their own, either their own dorm or their own wing and all, and all that kind of stuff, you know.  Back then, in the late '40s [1940s] and early '50s [1950s], you know, this was something we fought very, very much against because, you know, this is the way it always was, you know, segregating blacks and so forth.  And so we, we were very strong integrationist and they say we formed this, this chapter, the NAACP, and that really, I think, changed, changed my life significantly because I got involved with the NAACP, I, they had their convention in 1950, which would have been my sophomore year in Boston [Massachusetts] and you were talking, you had mentioned earlier the, the year of the Korean War.  I remember exactly what had happened because as, and I remember I was walking out of one of the, one of the meetings and seeing the newspaper, you know, the guy selling newspapers, s- you know, saying that we'd gone to war, we had gone to war with Korea and that's when I met people like Clarence Mitchell [Clarence M. Mitchell, Jr.] and Thurgood Marshall and so forth and became very active in the, in the youth wing of the, of the NAACP.
Story_ID: 420976
Speaker 1: Now the youth wing of NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Youth Council], the people I've interviewed and stuff and things I read about was really something.
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean it was really, I mean, the youth wing of the NAACP was--pushed the envelope constantly.
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah.  We got, yeah, that's what we were doing.  When people talk about the Civil Rights Movement beginning, you know, with Montgomery [Alabama] and all of that, I mean, we really saw ourselves as the vanguard of the Civil Rights Movement in the, in the 1950s and I, you know, as I say, got very involved in that, was selected to be the youth orator at the national convention in Atlanta [Georgia], I remember, I've still got the posters, you know, of Thurgood Marshall and me being the two speakers because, you know, it was kind of the youth night and I was, I was the youth speaker.  So I became extremely, extremely active in that. And the, there was an organization in New York [New York] called the Young Adult Council of the National Social Welfare Assembly [National Human Services Assembly] and that was made up of representatives of all of the major sort of, sort of, sort of youth groups, the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association], the Collegiate Council for the United Nations, the World Federalist [World Federalist Movement], the various religious groups, the Catholics, the Protestants and so forth and so I was the NAACP representative on that, and as a result, got to be, got elected to attend conferences, first one in Senegal in 1952 which I went to two weeks after I graduated [from Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], as one of the four American delegates to that conference representing NAACP and then two years later, when I was in law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] went, was one of the delegates to the conference in Singapore, you know, and all of this, all this came out of my, out of my NAACP thing and when I went to law school, the NAACP board elected me as the first college member of the national board.  So I was, I was on the board, on the board during the three years I was in law school during the time of the Brown decision [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] and all of that.  So, you know, I got to, you know, I got very involved, you know, in all of the things that the NAACP was, was doing.  And used to, used to travel around the country speaking for them in various, in various places, so.
Story_ID: 420977
Speaker 1: This trip to Senegal, must have really been dramatic (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, it was--
Speaker 1: I mean, had you, had you--
Speaker 2: --it was something.  The first time I'd been out of the country, you know.
Speaker 1: --and going to Africa.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, it was two weeks after, after I graduated [from Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  In those days, this was before jets.  You would fly first to Gander in Canada to--in Newfoundland [Canada] to refuel and then you'd fly across and we flew across and landed in Amsterdam [the Netherlands], took the train from Amsterdam to Paris [France], you know, and this was just, you know, for me, this is sort of the greatest thing and then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This is 1952, right?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-two [1952].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the summer of 1952, and then flew from there to Dakar, Senegal, and--
Speaker 1: Now who was, that was, the country was still in the colonial rule and--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, it was still under colonial rule, yeah.
Speaker 1: And did you get a chance to meet--was Senghor [Leopold Sedar Senghor] a leader then?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well in fact, I saw Senghor in Paris because Senghor then was a member of the French Senate and two of his nephews I got to know quite well.  They were my age and before the, the year before the meeting in Senegal, we had the first international meeting in here in the states up at Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York] and they, they came over for that and we became fast friends.  And so when I was in Paris, they were in Paris and introduced me to their uncle, et cetera, you know, and so that was just, just a great time and going to Senegal I remember the other black guy there, the delegation, a fellow named George Carter who later became the first really major official at IBM [International Business Machines Corporation], became budget director, I guess, for IBM at one point.  Well, George and I went to Goree Island [Dakar, Senegal] to see the slave castle and that was one of the most emotional things I've ever done.  I mean, you know, just seeing that for the first time.
Speaker 1: Had you heard of it be- prior to going to Senegal or was it something you heard about once you got to Senegal?
Speaker 2: Well, it was something I heard about, preparing to go to Senegal, I guess, yeah, but, you know, going there and seeing it and being in that place was just, just, was just overwhelming, just overwhelming.
Story_ID: 420978
Speaker 1: I just wondered if you, when you were reading the black papers, the Courier [Pittsburgh Courier; New Pittsburgh Courier] and stuff, did you--were you aware of the writings of J.A. Rogers [Joel Augustus Rogers] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh geez (laughter).
Speaker 1: --and Frederic Robb [Frederic H. Hammurabi Robb] and people like that?
Speaker 2: J.A. Rogers, I mean, his 'Sex and Race' ['Sex and Race: Negro-Caucasian Mixing in All Ages and All Lands'].  I mean, you know, that was a guilty pleasure, you know what I mean (laughter).  Get that book at night, you'd read it, oh yeah, oh yeah.  I still have those volumes.  Oh, yeah, J., J.A. Rogers was a, you know, was a great myth, mythmaker and you know you'd read all that stuff, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: And the travel, and he traveled all over the world, you know, and or writing and researching, you know, at his own expense (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, oh yeah, no, no, I, yeah no, I read, I read all those guys in those days, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As I said, you know, I really loved, loved to read and then you know people like Bill Harrison [William Harrison] at the, at the Chronicle [Boston Chronicle], you know, would suggest things that I should be reading, and so forth, and all this kind of thing.  So I was, you know, I was getting a good, a good grounding in all of this.
Speaker 1: Now what, I know there's something that took place in the late '30s [1930s], I don't know if you're aware of this but, well you were a little kid then, but I know, founder of the Harlem History Club, Willis Huggins [Willis Nathaniel Huggins], actually spoke before the League of Nations on behalf of Ethiopia--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and, did you, yeah--
Speaker 2: No, I didn't know about it at the time but, yeah, but, yeah, but since then, yeah, right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they were all, I mean, he and Rogers knew each other, you know, Arthur Schomburg [Arturo Alfonso Schomburg], of course was, was collecting all the books and--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --he had like a, they were all associated with Sc- George Schuyler--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --whose daughter was a great international concert piano--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Philippa, Philippa Schuyler, oh yeah, oh yeah, no.
Speaker 1: Yeah, concert pianist, I mean, these, I guess I'm raising these to I guess as a, I mean, for a black kid growing up in any town in the U.S. and, you know, reading the paper, I guess, some of these things would give this kind of an international feeling--
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --we were around the world doing things.
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah, no, yeah, oh yeah.  All those names, you know, recently they've been advertising on PBS [Public Broadcasting Service], 'Forgotten Genius,' you know, Percy Julian [Percy Lavon Julian], you know, some of those.  I mean, that was a household name in those days.  You know, I mean, these, you know, so that, you know, all these, all these names, you know, I read about and, you know, and knew about and--
Speaker 1: What was it like, Blaise Diagne, he was a French minister--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah--
Speaker 1: --from Senegal.
Speaker 2: Blaise Diagne was, during the First World War [World War I, WWI], was sort of the great, sort of Senegalese and he, I guess is the first African to be buried in the, oh, what's it call, in Paris [France], the, oh, it'll come to me, you know, the famous thing where, where the greats of, are there.  And I remember going there just to see his, you know, his grave, you know, gravesite there and it was just, a very experience, you know, oh yeah, Blaise Diagne, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Also, I guess, also like the Josephine Baker got the Croix de guerre--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --from the French government, you know, black American receiving that for heroism during the war.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And these are--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I remember when I was at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], one of the things we did, the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], you know, we would, whenever anyone of any stature was, you know, coming through, we'd get to them, and I remember going over when Josephine Baker was performing here in Boston [Massachusetts] I went over to see her and invited her to, you know, to come, to come over to Harvard and so forth, you know, so I got a chance to meet her.  You know, I got to meet all these sort of people, at the time, it was really a great, you know, a great thrill.
Speaker 1: What about Marian Anderson.  Did you get a chance to meet with, she's--
Speaker 2: No, no, I never, I never met her but, of course, again, you know, that was an event that, you know, that everyone knew about, you know, the DAR [Daughters of the American Revolution] and all of that, yeah.  You know, we, you know, I mean, again, all of these things were, you know, were sort of household, household word.  So you know, even though I grew up in an area that was, you know, that was all around me white, you know, I mean, you know, all, you know, my association with, you know, with the black world was, you know, was very strong and then as I spent my summers, you know, in New York [New York], and I had relatives, I had an uncle, my father's [Walter R. Carrington] brother, who was a doctor in New York, and who knew, in fact who went to med school at Howard [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] with Charles Drew [Charles R. Drew], you know, so they were good friends.  So I, you know, so I, you know, would get immersed in all of this all the time and as I say, and, you know, when I went off to college and got active in the NAACP, you know, that was, was extremely important for me and, and really got me involved in the whole international field as well.
Story_ID: 420979
Speaker 1: Was there any professor at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] or official that was a mentor to you at Harvard or really made things easier or better for you there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, Clarence Ferguson [Clarence Clyde Ferguson, Jr.], who became, who was an ambassador, who later became an ambassador to Uganda and then was President Nixon's [President Richard Milhous Nixon] sort of special representative during the be- the civil war in Nigeria [Nigerian Civil War], was a teaching fellow then in the, at the law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and taught to me constitutional law when I was an undergraduate.
Speaker 1: Now was Ferguson black?  Was he--
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, so--
Speaker 2: Not Clarence, Clyde Ferguson.
Speaker 1: Clyde Ferguson, okay.
Speaker 2: Clyde Ferguson, I'm sorry, Clyde, yeah.  Clyde Ferguson, yeah.
Speaker 1: Clyde Ferguson, okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, he was black.
Speaker 1: Now I imagine there weren't too many blacks at Harvard?  But he was--
Speaker 2: No, no, there weren't.  At that time, no.  There were no, he was the only black, I think, that I interacted, you know, that was on the faculty in any sense when I was an undergraduate but Clyde was, you know, a great guy and very helpful and, you know, I decided I wanted to go to law school and constitutional law because I wanted to get really involved in the whole civil rights thing and, in fact, Thurgood [Thurgood Marshall] wanted me to come, you know, the summer I graduated, wanted me to, you know, to come work with them in New York [New York], but I got drafted.  So I had to, had to go off and spend, and spend a couple of years in the [U.S.] Army.
Story_ID: 420980
Speaker 1: Did you end up in Korea or, or what happened (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, I ended up in Germany.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) It was, it was very interesting.  When I went through, well, first of all, the year, usually they give commissions to people who have graduated from law school, it's automatic, you know, you automatically go in as a second lieutenant.  The year I went in, for some reason, they decided they weren't going to do this.  So all of us went in as just ordinary soldiers.  Actually, that was very good for me.  First of all, it meant I'd spend only two years rather than three years, which you would spend as an officer plus it gave me a lot of freedom to sort of play the system that I wouldn't have had, that I wouldn't have had elsewhere, otherwise, and, they sent me off to clerk typist school and one, I mean, I got two things out of the [U.S.] Army: I learned how to type and I learned how to make a really tight bed, you know (laughter).  You know, those were two things the Army taught me but when we finished clerk typist school, and they were giving us our assignments, one of the, you know, they said, you know, some of the people are going to Iceland but they said that only whites.  The Icelanders, Iceland would not accept any blacks, you know, so that, so I had a real moral dilemma because what I really should have done, you know, was get on the phone and tell the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and raise hell.  On the other hand, I didn't want to go to Iceland (laughter), you know, so I sort of let it slide and then they had, I remember they had four places in German- in Germany and I got one of them.  So I went off to Germany and had a great time.  I mean, I guess, in fact, I guess when I was in basic training, I had a sergeant say to, that gave me the greatest compliment, he said, he said, "Soldier, you are the most civilian acting soldier I've ever seen" (laughter) you know, but I got over to Germany and the word went out, "Hey, we got a Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] lawyer in the company," and so everybody, you know, would come to me with their problems and the good thing about it was that because I was an enlisted man, I could not be a prosecutor.  I could only act as defense counselor because only officers could prosecute which was great for me because I, you know, I, that's what I wanted to do.  I mean, I never wanted to be a prosecutor, I wanted to be, and so, so, you know, I would have these guys come to me and I'll never forget there was this white kid from Mississippi, Glenn E. Reddy [ph.], I'll never forget his name, who was a real fuck up.  I mean, he screwed up all the time and he was always, always in trouble and his, but his father had some influence and so his father would get a hold of his congressman or somebody and get him out of trouble, but this time they figured, no more of that and his father told him he said, "Glenn, I can't get you out of trouble this time, but the Army will give you a good lawyer I'm sure and you treat him just like you'd treat me," not knowing, of course (laughter) that this black guy was representing him.  And so I represented him and got him off and as a result the word went around and in, in Germany where I was, in Mannheim, Seckenheim, there were segregated bars, there were four bars.  There was a white bar, a hillbilly bar, a Latino bar and a black bar, and you didn't mix, you know, I mean a black guy didn't go into a white bar and then that kind of thing, the white guy didn't go to no black bar and I was welcome in all of them because that's where all my clients were.  (Laughter) And so, you know I'd go into all these damn things. And in fact, just before I got there, like a few months before I got there, Heidel- Heidelberg [Germany], which was right next to Mannheim, was a place that was sort of off limits to black soldiers.  In fact, the MPs [military police] would sort of stop you from going there but that luckily ended before I got there.  And so I spent most of my time in Heidelberg, which was a nice college town and it was, you know, it was great fun, but I spent a lot of, you know, a lot of my time defending guys in the Army (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Let me rewind a little bit.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I think I lost something.  Now, when did you graduate from law school?  Had you finished law school yet at this point?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I graduated in '55 [1955].
Speaker 1: In '55 [1955], okay, so this is, you're in the service in '55 [1955]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I'm in the service.
Speaker 1: --now that you--okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in the summer of '55 [1955], I get--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I get drafted.

Speaker 1: Take us through some of the highlights of Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] before, before the [U.S.] Army, then we'll, zoom past Army (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, okay, all right, right, okay.  Yeah, as I say, there were four, four blacks in the class at Harvard and it's very interesting, one of them, my roommate, Jim Harkless [HistoryMaker James M. Harkless], became--he's a great singer, one of the great voices--he became the first black president of the Glee Club [Harvard Glee Club].  Another black in my class, Bill Simmons [William M. Simmons], became the first black editor, chief editor of The Harvard Crimson, which is the most prestigious college, and oldest maybe, college newspaper in the country.  And then I was, I was sort of the politician in the class, and I was elected class marshal, so that, you know, we really had a group of achiever- you know, of, of achievers in that, in that class and we were all very active in class stuff, and--
Speaker 1: Now who was the fourth one?
Speaker 2: Oh, the fourth one was, was Herb Hughes [Herbert Hughes], who later went on to work for, I guess, for the National Science f- I've forgotten exactly (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) National Science Foundation, or--?
Speaker 2: I think, I think, I'm not sure, but, in fact recently, the Harvard Foundation [Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations], in fact last spring, honored, honored us with medals for our achievements.  We were very activist, a very activist group in, in the college and I was, again, followed up the stuff that I'd done in high school [Everett High School, Everett, Massachusetts], I was very, I was active as a debater and, and in public speaking and, and headed up the largest political organization on the campus called, the Harvard Liberal Union and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, you know, it was, it was a fascinating time because, you know, this was at a time when so much of the, the activity post-World War II [WWII] and the civil rights fight was coming up and we, we had all kinds of rallies and programs on a lot of the things that were going on in the, in the South at that, at that time.
Speaker 1: You were privy to a lot of the different struggles going on in the South--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, oh yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and the lawsuits in Virginia--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --in Arkansas--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, yeah, well, especially through my activities with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  Oh yeah, and I was, yeah, I was very active in that and, as I say, used to, you know, do a lot of public speaking on this and the, I'm trying to, I'm trying to remember what some of the, what some of the major issues were in that time because, you know, you still had, had incidences of lynchings and that kind of thing and so we would (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear) the Johns case in Virginia, Vernon Johns' daughter in Virginia, I think that was one of the cases in--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I can't remember all those, yeah, but you know, but there were a lot.  I mean, there was, you know, too many.  And so, we, you know, throughout--and the interesting thing about the NAACP chapter, as it was true of the NAACP chapters in almost all of the northern schools, the membership was overwhelmingly white because they, you know, there just weren't enough blacks around to, you know, so that, so we had a lot of black--a lot of white students who were, who were active in, in the whole civil rights thing at, at Harvard.
Story_ID: 421312
Speaker 1: In '52 [1952], this is the year you graduated (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Graduated, right.
Speaker 1: --undergraduate school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And your major was, at that time?
Speaker 2: Well, American history.
Speaker 1: American history, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And who was, I mean, I guess I'll just have to ask this, who was considered, I guess, the dean of American history at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] in those days?
Speaker 2: Well, Arthur Schlesinger [Arthur M. Schlesinger, Sr.]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --both, both the father and the son [Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Um-hm, okay (unclear).
Speaker 2: And, in fact, no I guess they made an offer to [HistoryMaker] John Hope Franklin later because it always, because, you know, we get after them about the question of black faculty and they kept saying, well, we've offered Ralph Bunche, you know, a job here.  And in those days, they had what was, what was, I used to call the Ralph Bunche excuse because, you know, they would always say, oh, we would be happy to have a black in this position, or that position, if only Ralph Bunche were available, you know, as though Ralph Bunche were the only black.  I mean, he was sort of the Colin Powell [HistoryMaker General Colin L. Powell] of his time but, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So the Ralph Bunche excuse, huh?
Speaker 2: But, Bunche's daughter was at school with us, she was a couple of years behind us and one of the nicest people I've ever met, but, yeah, and yeah he was another great influence on me, Ralph Bunche.  I mean, his whole career and so forth--
Speaker 1: Right, right, that would have to be--
Speaker 2: --was, was very important.
Speaker 1: So, so did you get a chance to really talk to him and (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, I have a picture with him, I guess it was at that meet- that NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] conference, annual convention in Atlanta [Georgia].  He was, he was there and I got, I got to meet him then, but I didn't really know him well, you know, but, you know, I got, I got a chance to meet him and so forth.
Speaker 1: Did you, did you know [HistoryMaker] Carmel Marr?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, Carmel Carrington Marr, yeah--
Speaker 1: Yeah, C- oh.
Speaker 2: --but no relation, no relation, you know.
Speaker 1: I know she was active with that UN [United Nations] group as well.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And Channing Tobias [Channing Heggie Tobias]?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, well Channing Tobias was the first black president, or chairman of the board, I guess, of the NAACP, yeah, yeah, chairman.
Speaker 1: The first black one, now this is, would be a shock to younger people to find that out but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, the way in which it was set up, I mean, the idea was to have the chief executive officer, would be black, the--what was then called the executive secretary, and then the, the president was white, and, you know, that was the way Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois] and them set it up back in 1912 (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And then there was the Spingarn brothers [Arthur B. Spingarn and Joel Elias Spingarn] before, right, before--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, right the Spingarns right, yeah.
Speaker 1: --before Channing Tobias.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  So Channing Tobias was the first, was the first black and he was the, he was the president when I was on the board of the NAACP--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is--
Speaker 2: From fif- I was on it from '52 [1952] to '55 [1955], until I went into the [U.S.] Army.

Speaker 1: Is it time to talk about A Phi A [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity], yet?
Speaker 2: Sure, sure, okay.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay, so, we have an artifact here that--
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah this is a paddle, at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] there were no fraternities.  Harvard did not allow fraternities but in the Boston [Massachusetts] area, there was a chapter of A Phi A and a lot of people from the various schools, in fact, one of the things I ought to point out is that there were relatively few blacks in the major schools, like Brown [Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island] and so forth around here, but we would all get, we would all get together on the weekends, they would all come up, and so we had some of these sort of group organizations and one of them was A Phi A and I joined it while I was, while I was an undergraduate and Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] came up here to Boston, to Boston University, I guess, around '51 [1951] or '52 [1952], I can't remember the exact year, but he had never joined a fraternity when he was at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] and he decided, when he was here, that he would join A Phi A.  And so, this paddle is addressed to Big Brother Walter Carrington [HistoryMaker Walter C. Carrington] and with the, with the date, 1952, and with the names of the pledgees of the members of that pledge group, among whom was, was Martin and this is, this is the paddle that I used to help him across the burning sands.  I often tell people whether or not Martin believed in nonviolence at that point, some of us in A Phi A (laughter) A Phi A did not and so this, this paddle was when I (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  (Simultaneous) Let me see the other side.
Speaker 2: Yeah, let's flip the, that side for, yeah, we always get the names.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I imagine he had to s- he couldn't, well not that he was doing sit-ins then but, he probably wouldn't have wanted to after that day--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) I guess, I suppose.
Speaker 1: But, yeah, we were all very good friends.  In fact, I remember when I went, when I was in law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], I went off to a meeting of this world assembly of youth that I told you I went to in Senegal in '52 [1952], in '54 [1954], it was in Singapore and on the way there we spent some time in India and while I was there, I met Vinoba, Vinoba Bhave who was the leading Gandhian disciple, the disciple of Gandhi [Mahatma Gandhi], and we walked with him.  He would walk from village to village and would ask the people in the village to treat him as one of their own and to give them, give him one-sixth of their land that he would then redistribute to the poor and it was really a magnificent experience to, to walk with him (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Can you spell his name for us?
Speaker 1: Vinoba, V-I-N-O-B-A, Bhave, B-H-A-V-E.  He was, he was known as India's walking saint and he was the leading disciple---
Speaker 2: Of Gandhi.
Speaker 1: --of Gandhi.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: And I remember when I came back, talking to Martin about this and about, you know, about my whole experience with, with the nonviolent movement there and with, and with Bhave because, you know, he had not yet, you know, gone to India and so I, you know, I was able to, to share a lot of these experiences with him but--
Speaker 1: There's so many different strains of ideas influence somebody, you know, I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --any person's ideology.
Speaker 2: Sure, sure.
Speaker 1: And this was certainly, probably had some impact on Dr. King, I would think.
Speaker 2: Sure, well, yeah, but I remember when I was in the [U.S.] Army, and I was standing in, in assembly, you know, for mail call and I had a copy of Jet, and I opened it up, and that was my first information about the Montgomery [Alabama] boycott and I saw Martin's picture there and so forth, you know.  And so I immediately wrote him a letter which has now ended up in, in the collection that Carson has put out of--
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Clayborne Carson's--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 2: --Clayborne Carson's thing, yeah, 'cause he called me when I was in Nigeria, when I was serving as ambassador to Nigeria, and asked me if they could, if they could reprint the letter in the collection but that was, you know, my first inkling of the whole, of what Martin was, was doing in the--back, back in, in Montgomery.
Story_ID: 421314
Speaker 1: So the, you know, my, my career as an undergraduate at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] was one I really, I really enjoyed because it got me active in politics and other kinds of things and it was during that time there that I, that I switched from my [maternal] grandmother's [Annie Durant] attachment to the Republicans to becoming a, you know, an ardent Democrat and liberal.  And so, you know, those four years were very important and I was really happy they were able to establish a chapter of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and to make one of our major goals, increasing the number, the number of blacks at Harvard.
Speaker 2: Okay, so did it increase somewhat?  Did it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, not, somewhat, I mean, by the time I left, I guess the time I left law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], it was up to maybe about seventeen or eighteen in the class, and it wasn't until, until Martin Luther King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] dea- assassination, that it really, it really opened up.
Speaker 2: Okay, then that's 1960- that's twenty years later, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's, yeah that's '68 [1968], yeah.
Speaker 2: But it quadrupled after you made your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah--
Speaker 2: So that's--
Speaker 1: --yeah, it quadrupled and we, you know, we had, we were hoping, you know, to, to get even more but--
Speaker 2: Okay, so, so you came back from the [U.S.] Army, you read about the bus boycott and, and--
Speaker 1: No it, it was when I was in the Army.
Speaker 2: Well, when you're in the Army, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it was in the Army, it was, in fact, my first, you know, I was still in basic training when I, when I read it because it was '55 [1955], you know, I, I just, I just got into the Army--
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause it, well you went to--
Speaker 1: --at Fort Dix [New Jersey].
Story_ID: 421315
Speaker 1: Well tell us about law school. Now, we didn't--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) talk about Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: How, when did you, or how did you decide or what factors influenced your decision to go to Harvard Law School?
Speaker 2: Well, I had always wanted to, well, be a lawyer from the time I decided that I wasn't going to be a preacher because when I was, when I was a kid, I was very active in the, in the Baptist, in our, in our Baptist church and, in fact, used to be the, the speaker at the Easter sunrise services, you know, which was usually the, devoted to youth.  So I would usually, you know, speak at either the one our church gave or other churches gave and so forth but I decided that that's, you know, that the ministry was not what I wanted and that, and that law was, was really the career that I wanted to, to follow.  And so I had the decision to make when I, when I was in my senior year at college [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] as to where and it was really, there were really only two choices for me, either Yale [Yale Law School, New Haven, Connecticut] or Harvard, and Yale appealed to me because it had a reputation for social consciousness in the law, you know, and, and that was really, really what I liked, whereas Harvard was really mostly preparing people to be active in the corporate world and all that kind of thing.  However, I could not see spending three years in New Haven [Connecticut].  You know, I would go down there for football game--for the Harvard, Yale football games and so it was really desire, you know that, to be in Cambridge [Massachusetts] that decided me on Harvard rather, rather than Yale, than Yale Law School.  And so in, in law school, I continued to be, to be very active.  In '56 [1956] was the Adlai Stevenson [Adlai Stevenson II] campaign and I was one of the vice chairman of students for Stevenson and so I spent a lot of time, probably more time than I should have (laughter) as a law student, traveling around, helping to organize stuff for, for Adlai Stevenson.  And so I got involved in a number of other things in, in law school and decided while I was in law school that I really wanted to be involved in constitutional law.  In fact, what I thought I was really going to do was go work for the, for the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]. And it was interesting when these law firms would send people in to recruit, they never were interested in, in the black students.  In fact, at that time, there was no law firm that I knew of that had blacks in there.  And so when I got out of law school and got out of, came back from the [U.S.] Army and started a law practice, I got together with, with two other friends, one black and one white, and we formed our own law firm because in those days, you couldn't, and I remember once coming back to one of the black law school--black students conferences, back in the '70s [1970s], and I asked one of the kids there, I said, you know, "What are you planning to do when you get out?"  He said, "Oh," he says, "you know, I really want to go back to the community and help the community out and so forth, but I'm getting all these offers from all these law firms, you know," and I just started to laugh.  He said, "Why are you laughing?" I said, "Man, I never had that dilemma" when I was in law school because there wasn't, there wasn't a law firm that was interested, really, in blacks. And we had, we had heard the story then of probably the brightest guy to come through the law school, probably before Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama], was, boy, now I've, Bill Coleman [HistoryMaker Mr. William T. Coleman, Jr.], who was, who was on the, I guess he was probably the first black to be on the law review [Harvard Law Review] but not president of the law review and the prob- and he later clerked for a [U.S.] Supreme Court justice and yet he had great trouble getting, getting a job with, with a law firm.  He finally, he finally did but only, you know, in a way. You know, Andy White [ph.], who had his kind of experience and his kind of academic record, would have had no problem.  So, we're thinking, hell, if you know, if Coleman had those kinds of problems, you know, what are we going to face?  And so, my real interest was really in constitutional law and, and working with the, with the NAACP in, in the law.  But as I say, once I got out of law school, I got, I got drafted and went off, went off that summer into the Army.
Story_ID: 421316
Speaker 1: Let's pick up the [U.S.] Army then--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and we had you in Germany--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --and you were tryin- starting to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah in Germany--
Speaker 1: --get involved--
Speaker 2: --when I was in, in Mannheim [Germany], which is right next to Heidelberg [Germany], I was spending most of my time defending guys in, in various court martial cases and the great thing about that was that the [U.S.] military code of justice [Uniform Code of Military Justice] was more liberal than, than the criminal code in any state.  I mean, it was really great.  The problem with the military law, however, is that the courts are so biased.  That is, they're made up of officers and, you know, they assume that the people coming before them are guilty, but if you do your research, and you could find all kinds of loopholes, so I was able to get guys off.  I mean, I was getting guys off left and right, you know, on, on apply- on strictly applying the law.  And so it was great fun for me and then later I was able to finagle an appointment to the judge advocates' group [Judge Advocate General's Corps] in Heidelberg and, you know, spent, spent time again defending, defending people because, again, I couldn't be a prosecutor, which served me fine because I, you know, any time I could stick it to the system, I, I enjoyed it.
Story_ID: 421317
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite law professor at Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] when you were there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess, when you say favorite, I mean, there was one professor there who was the toughest, meanest guy, a guy named Barton Leach [W. Barton Leach] who taught property but was so damn bright and so damn good and his, the other guy who taught law, property law, Casner [A. James Casner], I mean, these, James Casner, these two guys were really bright and really, really kept us on our, on our toes and they were the best, the best professors at the law school.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Learned a lot from them in spite of the fact that I probably disagreed with their politics and everything else but they were--
Speaker 1: But they knew their stuff.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, they were, they were, they were great teachers.
Story_ID: 421318
Speaker 1: In the [U.S.] Army, so, you got a chance to defend some soldiers and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, right, and, you know, they say, I, you know, I spent two years and during that time I was able to go to, you know, I went on leave in Paris [France] when the festival of, of art was having, no, no, it wasn't a festival, it was, there was a big meeting being called which brought together people like Richard Wright and all of the black intellectuals from the United States and the black intellectuals from Africa, especially from the French speaking countries, and I was able to go, to go to that when I was, when I was in the Army and saw, saw a lot of my, a lot of the people I had known from my days in the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].
Speaker 1: So, so Richard Wright was there?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Who else?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, we were, Wright, Wright--
Speaker 1: I guess the Presence Africaine?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, it was the Presence Africaine.  Yeah, Wright and a whole bunch of other folk were there (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) E. Franklin Frazier maybe?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Horace Mann Bond and all of them were there and it was, someone, you know, a lowly, private in the Army, you know, going to that was just, you know, was just great.  So, yeah, so I, you know, I, I had a good time in the Army.  I mean, I would not, you know, would not recommend it to anybody, I mean, the idea of, you know, of taking orders and that kind of thing, you know, I always bristled against but I was, I was able to carve out a niche for myself that, that made it very plain and it was nice being, being in Europe, being in Germany at the time.
Speaker 1: What was the difference between, I mean, how it felt to be in Germany than being in the United States?
Speaker 2: Well, well, I mean, being in Germany in the Army, you know, being in Europe, being in a different kind of place, you know, it was, it was a great, a great feeling and developed one of my closest friendships there with Moses Gunn who was, who later became a very, you know, a very famous actor back here but--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --Moses and I were in the same unit together and we became very, very fast and close friends as a result of our, of our experience (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He seemed to be a bright man (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, he was, he was really good.  A great loss when he died.
Story_ID: 421319
Speaker 1: So you came back [from Germany] in 19--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I came back in 1957.  I was there in '55 [1955] to '57 [1957].  (Laughter) An interesting thing, I, I came back to Fort Dix [New Jersey], was a place for, you know, from which the, you know, you went through all the things for discharge, and I was getting ready to come back to Boston [Massachusetts] and a friend of mine in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] invited me, he said, "Hey man, you know, why don't you, why don't you come on down to, to Philly and, you know, and spend a few days?" And I, so I did that and he took me into this nightclub and I walk into this nightclub and this woman is singing, someone I had never heard of before, and she was singing this song called, Little, 'Little Girl Blue,' and it just, it just blew me away and, of course, it was Nina Simone, and I got a chance to talk with her and, and ask her, you know, where can I get your records, and it turned out that she hadn't, that she had--at that point, hadn't, hadn't yet recorded and I told her I had a friend who was at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] who later became very, a very big A&R [artists and repertoire] guy, Tom Wilson, and, and in fact who had, who had put out some, who had his own record, record label [Transition Records] and he, he recorded some of the great jazz guys of that period first.  He, he was sort of the person who discovered a lot of these guys and when I, I told Tom, I said, "Man, you know, you've got to, you've got to record this."  He said, "No, singers are too much of a problem, man." You know, he just went on and passed up on her, I thought, was a great, a great mistake.  But anyway, I'll get back to her when we, when we get to Nigeria because she played a very important, important role in, in my life later.
Story_ID: 421320
Speaker 1: So I, you know, I went down to, to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and then, and then came back to Boston [Massachusetts] and came back at a very, for me, a very opportune time because there was a big fight going on in the black community over who the governor [Foster Furcolo] should appoint to the vacancy on the Commission Against Discrimination [Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination], which was the commission that was charged with enforcing our civil rights laws.  We had a, we had laws against discrimination in employment, in public accommodation, in housing, in education and so there was a big fight going on between two opposing camps in the, in the black Democratic community, but someone who had been, the fellow who had been the first black on the--there's a three-person commission.  They usually have one, one black, one Jew and usually a Roman Catholic, but it didn't have to be, it could be a Prot- but anyway, you know, at that point there were three commissioners so it was the black spot that was open.  And so this friend of mine who had been, who had been the first black commissioner and who was now the top aide to, to the governor, found I was back and called me up and said, "The governor wants to see you."  So, you know, I had just gotten back, didn't even have a suit (laughter) you know, and so I went up, I went up to see the governor, had a good talk with him and, you know, and wasn't really quite sure what, what all this was about and a week or so later I get a call from my friend, Elwood McKenney [Elwood S. McKenney], who says the governor wants you up at the State House [Massachusetts State House, Boston, Massachusetts] at such a such a time and so I said, okay.  So I went up to the State House, I walk in and there was a room filled with the elite of the, of the black political class here in Boston and there are, and there's a press, is in there as well.  And so, the governor says, "I've called you all together here, and I'm really happy to announce to the press that, that unanimously the black, the black leaders have recommended Walter Carrington [HistoryMaker Walter C. Carrington] as the new commissioner." (Laughter) You know, okay, you know, I just, it just kind of blew me away.
Story_ID: 420991
Speaker 1: So we were just talking off camera, Foster Furcolo was the governor of--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --of Massachusetts then and--
Speaker 2: Of the Commo- right, yeah, and he was the one who appointed me to the, to the commission and so right, yeah, right after I was appointed, you know, I got all, you know, all the press coming after me and so forth, you know, asking me all kinds of questions about this and that and then The Boston Globe, which is the major newspaper here, had a story pointing out that I was the youngest person ever appointed to a post by, by a governor that had to be confirmed by the Governor's Council [Massachusetts Governor's Council], which is the body that confirms in this state rather than the, rather than the Senate [Massachusetts Senate].  So, you know, I just, just back from the [U.S.] Army and find myself now a commissioner on the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination and had a chance to, you know, to really get, stay active in the whole civil rights thing.
Speaker 1: So, you're only twenty-seven, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Twenty-seven years old.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and Massachusetts was really, really the lead- one of the leaders, Massachusetts and New York, in terms of civil rights laws.  Again, I think it was a function of the fact that the black population was so small that bills, you know, whenever a new bill was passed to strengthen the commission or give it more jurisdiction, it, it sort of passed through without, without much, much problem, with both Democratic and, and Republican support.  So, you know, I'm on the, I'm on the commission and there, there were about, maybe thirteen states now that, that had these commissions and we used to get together every year, you know, for conferences and I remember being at this, at a conference and this fellow from the New York commission [New York State Commission Against Discrimination; New York State Commission for Human Rights] comes up to me and says, "Your," he says, "your name is Walter Carrington [HistoryMaker Walter C. Carrington]?"  I said, "Yeah."  He says, he says, "It can't be."  He says, he says, "I started my career in this field with the, with President Roosevelt's [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] FEPC, Fair Employment Practices Commission [sic. Fair Employment Practices Committee], and the first case I had was a case with someone named Walter Carrington [Walter R. Carrington]."  I said, "Hey that was my dad." And he said, you know, and we sort of, we sort of laughed.  This was the thing when I told him about, you know, the whole thing that came out of, came out of the Oregon shipyard [Kaiser Shipyards] and, you know, we laughed.  He said, you know, I mean, this, this is really something that, you know, the son of the guy whose first case I handled is now a commi- you know, is now himself a commissioner handling, handling these cases.  And so, you know, I was, I was young enough and, and not so tied into any of the, any of the establishment that I could, you know, just sort of, sort of go off and, you know, push, push the envelope as far as, you know, as far as, you know, as far as I thought, I thought it could.
Story_ID: 420992
Speaker 1: You know, so I was involved in all kinds of case- but the big one, of course, happened with the, with the Boston Red Sox.  The Boston Red Sox were the last team to be lily white.  They did not have a black ball player.  They brought up a fellow named Pumpsie Green from their, from their farm club [Minneapolis Millers], and he traveled with them.  He was the first, first black player to travel with them in spring training, however because the hotels that the Red Sox stayed at would not allow a black to, to stay there, the Red Sox didn't have them, have him travel with them through spring training, they had him travel with, with the Chicago Cubs because they had some black players.  Oh, it was, it was a hell of a, hell of a thing that was going on in those days and, you know, instead of them using their clout to change the situation, they just, they just sort of, sort of went along with it and hopes were arising here that, you know, finally the Red Sox would hire a black player.  Now, the Boston Braves [Atlanta Braves] had been here, a baseball team when I was growing up, and they had hired Sam Jethroe, some years before, so, you know, and Jethroe was quite popular, there was no problem.  The problem, I think, with the Red Sox was that the, it was owned by a guy named Tom Yawkey who was from South Carolina and who had all the prejudices of South Carolina, they were managed by a, the manager of the team was a guy named Pinky Higgins who had said to some reporters once that there wouldn't be a nigger on this team as long as he was, as long as he was the manager.  So, you know, there was, there was this whole history with the Red Sox but everybody hoped that the Pumpsie Green thing was going to change.  There was a great white Boston [Massachusetts] sports writer named Dave Egan who led the fight, you know, in the press and was attacking the Red Sox all the time for the fact that they had no black player.  And so, at the end of spring training, the day before the team returns, the Red Sox announce that Pumpsie Green is not quite ready, and so they send him back to the minors.  So all kinds of hell takes place, and the president of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], I ran into him on the street and he says, "Walter [HistoryMaker Walter C. Carrington], they've done it to us again."  And I said, you know, "Herb [HistoryMaker Herbert Tucker, Jr.], look, let's not get angry about this. Let's, why don't you guys bring a case before the Commission Against Discrimination [Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination]?"  He said, "But do you guys have jurisdiction?"  And I said, "We won't know, you know, unless you bring the case."  So, they brought the case.
Story_ID: 420993
Speaker 1: I was assigned as the commissioner as the, as the investigating commissioner because the first step in any of these things is to have an investigation led by one of the commissioners, and if the commissioner finds there is probable cause, and you cannot settle it, then it goes to a formal hearing, publi- formal public hearing before the, the whole commission [Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination].  So, I, I had the case and one of the first things I had to do was go to New York to interview Jackie Robinson.  You know, this, this was a great thrill because the Red Sox [Boston Red Sox] had claimed that they didn't discriminate, that they had given Jackie Robinson a tryout.  Well, the story of that tryout is something quite, quite different.  In fact, when I saw Robinson, he said they're a bunch of goddamn liars.  He said, they, you know, the whole thing was, was a setup.  Because of the pressure that was, had been brought by people like, like Dave Egan and a member of the city council [Boston City Council] named Izzy Muchnick [Isadore Muchnick], they, they had agreed to have a trial for Robinson but none of the major people from the, from the Red Sox, you know, were down in the field watching it and so forth and it was really a kind of a sham, was Robinson and a couple of other players were there and just before it was over, one of The Boston Globe reporters reported hearing somebody from the, up in the bleachers where the office of the Red Sox was, yelling, "Get those niggers off the field."  And so, you know, the whole Robinson thing was, was a real sham.  The Red Sox also were the fir- had the first shot at Willie Mays and they had, they had passed on that.  One of their scouts had, had recommended this young kid, you know, and he, they would have the first, first dibs on him and they, they passed on that.  So, after extensive investigation, I made a finding of probable cause, and so we then had a public, a public hearing on the case.  And the Red Sox agreed, finally, to stop the practice of segregating players on, in spring training and using their clout to be sure that if they had any black players they could stay with the white players and all of that and we went through a number of things.  The Red Sox had never hired a black, a black player, a black person to work anywhere in Fenway Park [Boston, Massachusetts], even the most menial jobs.  There were, there were no blacks.  It was just, just completely white.  And then we got an informal agreement, they didn't want this, we agreed not to put this in the, in the formal agreement that they would recall Pumpsie Green, and they did.  And so they recalled Green, and Green became the first black player on the Red Sox and so the Red Sox became, became integrated.
Story_ID: 420994
Speaker 1: Now this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But, but the fallout from this (laughter) was something else.  I mentioned this very quaint institution we have called the Governor's Council [Massachusetts Governor's Council], which is made up of a bunch of politicians and they have to pass on, on the governor's recommendations, not the Senate [Massachusetts Senate], and so I was coming up for reappointment and the head of the Governor's Council calls me in and begins to lecture me, saying, "What are you trying to do, run the Red Sox [Boston Red Sox] out of town" and blah, blah, blah, and he just went after me and he says, "I'm going to make sure that you aren't reappointed."  You know, "I'm going to stop it" and blah, blah (unclear) so I went, I reported it to Governor Furcolo [Foster Furcolo] and Furcolo said, "Don't pay any attention, don't worry, you'll be reappointed," and, and I was.  And the agreement was of, some of the people on his staff had come to me and said, "Once the governor is re-elected, we want to appoint you as the budget director for the state, would you be willing?"  And I said, "Sure," you know, you know, "that's a nice step up."  Of course what happened is that Furcolo loses the primary, he got, he got beaten by the mayor of Springfield [sic.] and he lost and so that ended my opportunity to really have that kind of career here, but while I, while I was here, you know, in addition to being commissioner on the Commission Against Discrimination [Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination] because that was not a full-time job, (unclear) you could do other things so I also had my law practice and had my, my law office (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now what was the name of your firm?
Speaker 2: Maples, Carrington and Rhuland.  Lou Maples [Louis Maples] was a black lawyer who had been around a long time and we had our offices on 6 Beacon Street [Boston, Massachusetts], in a very, you know, really a great, a great location, overlooking the old, the old graveyard where some of the great heroes of the Revolution [American Revolution] are buried (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you know, I could look at that out the window.
Speaker 1: Crispus Attucks' monument [Boston Massacre/Crispus Attucks Memorial] is right there, that's--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well that, that's, that's not there but that's where, and then the other fellow was Frank Rhuland, a white fellow who was, who was at Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] with me and was very active in the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and the Liberal Union [Harvard Liberal Union], et cetera.  So the three of us set up this law firm.
Story_ID: 420995
Speaker 1: During this time, I was, I was extremely active.  I was making, I was speaking all, all around, all around the state [Commonwealth of Massachusetts] and, in fact, before Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] came, I was the guy who was, you know, who was sort of, sort of the one who was speaking at all the black churches around, you know, and so forth, and Martin came in and, you know, he, he took over a lot of that and I was organizing around the state, what we called fair housing committees 'cause that, 'cause housing discrimination was the biggest problem in the state and so we organized these fair housing committees and so we had them all around the state, organized, everywhere and at the time of the 1960 census, there was a disagreement between the legislature and the governor as to how the state should be redistricted afterwards and they couldn't come up with a redistricting plan because, one, you had the Democrats and the Republicans fighting.  And so the decision was made that since there was no re- they couldn't redistrict, that all, everybody running for congress had to run at-large so that, you know, people who had these nice safe districts, you know, were going to be at risk.  And so what you were going to have you were going to have probably about fifty people, fifty Irishmen from South Boston [Boston, Massachusetts], you know, running for some of these seats, you know, and dividing the vote and at the time, Ed Brooke [HistoryMaker Edward Brooke] was a very active, was very active as a lawyer here, and as a, and with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and I remember, Ed was one of my mentors.  He wrote a letter for me for when I went to Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts], he wrote a letter of recommendation for me, et cetera, and so he and I were quite close and we were talking about this and Ed was a Republican.  Ed, Ed really wanted to be a Democrat, but at that time, there was no possibility of him getting a Democratic nomination and so, you know, the only way he could get anything was, was in the Republican Party.  And so, we decided that both of us were going to run for congress.  With this at-large thing, I mean, I, I had an excellent chance because I had this statewide organization of all of these fair housing committees everywhere, you know, and these people would have gone out and worked like hell for me and Ed was, and Ed was going to run on the Republican side.  Well, unfortunately, cooler heads prevailed among the politicians and before the election, they came to an agreement on redistricting and so this idea of running at-large was, was gone. But then I was approached by a group--because I was living then in Cambridge [Massachusetts]--by a group in Cambridge, to run for the Cambridge City Council, and the agreement there was, it was called the Cambridge Good Government Association, and they had in recent years sort of controlled the, the government.  They were a good government organization and they wanted, they wanted me to run for city council and the agreement was that if I was re-elected to a second term, I would be the candidate for mayor, and Cambridge had never, had never had a black mayor.
Story_ID: 420996
Speaker 1: And in the middle of all of this, I had already formed my, my election committee, et cetera, and was, you know, beginning to get to work.  I went to a reception for, for the newly elected President Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy], that was held here in Boston [Massachusetts] and I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Were you a part of that campaign? The--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --Kennedy campaign--
Speaker 1: Yes, in fact--I was--I was working in the South, in fact, I went for the, I made my first trip to the South, went to Atlanta [Georgia] to organize some of the black colleges [HBCUs] there.  It was my first real experience with segregation.  I remember they had to send a, I couldn't go in the taxicab with the, with my white colleagues, they had to send a black cab to pick me up, you know, so that was my really first experience with segregation.  I had been, I had been to the South before, with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], but I never, never really run, run into this kind of thing.  So, yeah, so I was, I was active in trying to organize on black college campuses for the Kennedy campaign.  So I'm back here and I go to this reception for Kennedy, and I meet his brother-in-law, Sargent Shriver [R. Sargent Shriver], and Shriver says, "Hey, you know I've heard about you from various people" and so forth and so on and at that time I had already made two trips to Africa.  I had been to Senegal, as I said in '52 [1952], and then I had gone again in '59 [1959], leading a group of students on the Experiment in International Living to Nigeria.  So, I had this experience plus the Asia experience of Singapore and India and all of that.  And so, Shriver pointed out that, you know, he needed some people with experience to help, to help get the Peace Corps going in Africa and asked if I was interested and I said, yeah, I would be interested.  And so, I finally left the commission [Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination] before my time was up, was appointed by the Peace Corps and then they made an announcement of the s- the first seven overseas directors that they appointed, and I was one of them, but it was interesting because the other six they announced the countries to which they were being assigned, and for me they said, to a West African country to be identified later.  The reason for that was, that they wan- I was to go to Sene- to Sierra Leone but they hadn't yet signed the agreement.  So my first job was to go to Sierra Leone, negotiate with the government to bring the Peace Corps in.  I went, they agreed, and then I, and then I went back as director.  I think, the Senegal--the Sierra Leone group was the second or third group to go overseas, Ghana was the first and we were the second or third group to go overseas.  And so I spent two years in Sierra Leone, two years in Tunisia and then two years in Senegal, running programs for the Peace Corps and then went back to Washington [D.C.] and eventually ended up as director of all Africa operations for the Peace Corps which got me involved in a lot of travel, back and forth to Africa, going to some of the most remote villages, visiting, visiting the volunteers.  So I ended up spending ten years with, with, with the Peace Corps, all, all of the '60s [1960s], I was, I was with the Peace Corps.
Story_ID: 420997
Speaker 1: So you were there during, I guess, the years when most of the African countries are becoming independent (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah the--because the independence move- well, Ghana started in '57 [1957], Nigeria in '60 [1960] and a whole bunch of other countries started, you know, in the early '60s [1960s].  In fact, when I went to Sierra Leone, they had, they had just become independent, the April before I went there, I think, yeah, I think, yeah, 'cause we arrived just before New Year's, so--
Speaker 1: They had been a British protectorate, I suppose or something.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, they had been a British colony and so I--
Speaker 1: Kenya and a bunch of them.
Speaker 2: Well, no, Kenya was later.
Speaker 1: Sixty-four [1964] (unclear).
Speaker 2: They were later.  It happened in West Africa first and I used to always tell people that, tell my friends that all these African countries in West Africa should have put a mosquito on their flag because it was the mosquito that helped, more than anything else, I think, for early independence because these were the areas where the white folks didn't go because, you know, Europeans didn't go because of the, of malaria and so forth, whereas, you know, the places where they settled, Kenya and these other places, it took a long fight, a real hard fight to get independence.
Speaker 1: That's where the Mau Mau movement--
Speaker 2: Yeah, where the Mau Mau movement was in, was in Kenya and then, of course, you know, later the Portuguese colonies, Zimbabwe, South Africa, you know, all of these places, it took longer but West Africa really, really was first.  Actually, the Sudan was the first in '55 [1955] and then, and then Ghana in '57 [1957] and then it went on from, it went on from there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You spent a lot of time in Nigeria, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well--
Speaker 1: That being the most populous (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) I used to go back and forth, I used to go back and forth to Nigeria and as I said earlier, Nigeria was the first foreign country that I really knew anything about because of my experiences in New York [New York] visiting my, my cousins there and seeing these Nigerians who were coming to the United States to plead their case before the United Nations [UN] for, for independence.  So I had a real feel for the whole independence movement very early on.
Story_ID: 420998
Speaker 1: Well what are the, some of the highlights of your, those ten years?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Well, there were, you know, there, there were a lot.  I mean one of the great things, for example, when we first went to Sierra Leone, the great thing about having the Peace Corps there then was that the major educational institutions, the government ones were usually in the big cities, and then there were the religious schools.  With the Peace Corps, it gave the government the opportunity to push education out into the, into the rural areas.  And so we had our volunteers sort of serving in some of the most remote areas of the, of the country.  And so, I think, you know, I think we did a lot to help, to help the government to develop.  And one of the things I always told my volunteers is that, look, I may be the director of the program here, and the guy who, you know, who handles some of your problems, but I'm not your boss.  Your real boss is the Sierra Leonean, or the Tunisian or the, or the Senegalese person for whom you work, they're your boss.  Your job is to come out here, and if you're a teacher you're going to get paid the same thing that a Sierra Leonean teacher gets, not what you would get back in the states.  You're going to live the same way that they live and that, I think, is what, what made the Peace Corps successful, this idea that the volunteers went out there and really worked, worked for the governments to whom they were assigned.  Now this didn't often happen in other parts.  For example, in Latin America, there were a lot of problems because the volunteers sort of parachuted into places, and the governments really, really, really didn't care, they were doing it because, you know, the U.S. wanted it, but in Africa it was quite different and I think African volunteers, on a whole, had, came away with the best experience because of the fact that they, you know, they really lived. The way, and the other great thing about it was that in these countries that they learned the languages.  I mean, Peace Corps volunteers learned local languages, some of them in such a way that if you didn't see them, you wouldn't, you would sometimes wouldn't know that they, you know, there was, they were Americans and not native speakers and that was another great thing that the Peace Corps did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is the time when black America becomes more keenly aware of Africa, I guess, on a real sense--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --than ever before?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Now one of the great disappointments for the Peace Corps was that it was difficult to get a lot of blacks to be volunteers.  Well first of all, it was during the '60s [1960s] and a lot of movements were happening, also a lot of blacks felt they couldn't afford, you know, to give up two years.  What I tried to point out to people, is that in most cases, people who had gone to the Peace Corps and they come back, usually had more money in the bank than most of their colleagues did because we put part of their, part of their allowance away for them that they couldn't get to and they would get that in a lump sum when they, when they came back.  So, we had a real problem getting enough volunteers, but on the staff side, it was just the opposite.  The Peace Corps became by far and away the most integrated agency in Washington [D.C.] and, in fact, the state department [U.S. Department of State], in order, sometimes, to boost their numbers, would try to use the, include the Peace Corps numbers in it.  It was a time I remember when three of the top officers in the Peace Corps were held by blacks.  I was, I was the director for Africa, which was the largest region.  Joe Kennedy [Joseph Kennedy] was director for Southeast Asia, well for Asia actually, and then [HistoryMaker] C. Payne Lucas, who had, who I succeeded as director for Africa, was, was head of the Office of Returned Volunteers, which had become, had become a very important office as, you know, as we got a lot of volunteers coming back and so forth.
Story_ID: 420999
Speaker 1: And so, you know, the three of us--in fact, I remember one of the highlights back in Washington [D.C.] was dur- was during the Vietnam War when they had the big demonstration in Washington against the Vietnam War.
Speaker 2: Yeah I guess in '68 [sic. 1970], was it '68 [1968]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, yeah, it was probably around, yeah, it may have been, it may have been '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: That's the big--700,000, almost a million people [sic.] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, right, and so they, they all came and there were all of these, all of these problems, the White House [Washington, D.C.] was set--Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] was in the White House at the time and some of the returned volunteers were very active in all of this and they decided they were going to take over the Peace Corps building, at least they were going to take over the Asia section of the Peace Corps. And Ehrlichman [John Ehrlichman], who was, you know, one of Nixon's right-hand men, came to the Peace Corps and demanded that they be thrown out.  Now, it just happened that that weekend was the weekend I was the duty officer.  So I was sort of in charge of everything and so I remember going and finding the director of the Peace Corps and telling him, he was a recent appointee of the Nixon administration, and he was kind of nervous and I point out to him, I said, "Joe [Joseph Blatchford], if you allow the police to go in there and evict these people, you are going to have problems that you will never imagine."  I think I said, "The best thing is not to let the police go in there."  So he finally agreed and so then I had to go back and I had to negotiate with the police and they had someone from the White House there who (unclear) were sitting in this limousine and they were demanding, the White House guys were demanding that they go in because one of the things that they did, once they took over the Peace Corps building, they draped a flag out of the window of the, of Joe Kennedy's [Joseph Kennedy] office which was a pro-Vietcong flag and so this really got everybody upset.  And so they demanded and now the Peace Corps building was a building that, it was not a government building, it was a building that we rented.  It was not a government-owned building and so the police chief looked at me and said, "Okay, what's the Peace Corps position on this?"  And I said, "Well, the director of the Peace Corps has not, you know, has not ordered them out and he has told me that, you know, to continue negotiating with them."  And so the police chief then turned to the White House guy and said, "Hey, there's nothing I can do.  That's a private building, and unless the Peace Corps itself says to get out, you know, we can't, we can't do anything."
Story_ID: 421321
Speaker 1: So the police chief said, you know, "There's nothing I can do."  And so, you know, they got, they got very angry, but, so, so I then went back in and we negotiated and the agreement, you know, they, they agreed that, you know, as long as we didn't make a move against them that in the middle of the night, they would leave and they did.  So, around two A.M. they, they left.  So it was, it was, you know, it was a very busy weekend.  Usually, you know, when you're duty officer [for the Peace Corps], you know, it's--nothing happens but--
Speaker 2: Say it was a busy weekend.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but, but, yeah, I just happened to (laughter) draw the straw that, that weekend, but it was, it was a fascinating, it was a fascinating time, of course, to be, to be in Washington [D.C.].
Story_ID: 421322
Speaker 1: We discovered during the break that we skipped over--
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) a historic debate with Malcolm X that took place while you were the commissioner for the Massa- State of Massachusetts--
Speaker 2: Right, that's--
Speaker 1: --in 1959--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so we've got to rewind back to 1959 and tell us what happened now.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Malcolm X at this point was not world famous but he was a spokesman for the Nation of Islam, right?
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.  Yeah, he was, yeah he was still with the, with the Nation of Islam--
Speaker 1: I think he became famous, and correct me if I'm wrong, mostly on the strength of the CBS reports (unclear) produced that--
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, yeah, that's when he became, Nation--
Speaker 1: --you know, which appeared either in late '69 [1969] or '60 [1960], I'm not sure, '60 [1960], I think.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I am not sure whether that was before, before or after but he was, he was still quite, quite well-known.  I mean, when it was announced that, you know, that he was coming to Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], I mean, the place was just jam packed.  And what had happened was, the Harvard Law School Forum, which is a very prestigious kind of thing, they bring in all kinds of people from all around the world for their forums, and so they wanted to have Malcolm X, and they wanted to have a debate, and they had tried to get various people to come to debate him and nobody wanted to debate Malcolm X, you know.  And so, they, they had tried some people and so I was then a commissioner on the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination and some of the people in the forum knew me and so they asked me if I would be willing to debate him.
Speaker 1: Was that like when Archie Epps [HistoryMaker Archie C. Epps, III], was he one of the ones (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, Archie, Archie was not involved in this at all.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: No, no, he was not involved in this at all.  This was, you know, these are people who were, who were at the law school and the law school forum.  So, they asked me if I'd be willing to debate him and I said, fine, I'd be willing.  Now, the book of, there were a number of people, Eric Lincoln, I guess, was doing a study of the black Muslims at the time ['The Black Muslims in America,' C. Eric Lincoln]--
Speaker 1: Yeah, C. Eric Lincoln, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, and I had spoken with him and some other people, and I decided, I mean the reason, the reason I agreed to do it was that I regarded Malcolm and the Nation of Islam at that time as too conservative, and, and I knew that there was no way that I was going to debate Malcolm X and come at him from the right.  So I decided to come at him from the left.  And it was one of the most amazing experiences of my life.  We had dinner before the debate at the Harvard Faculty Club [Cambridge, Massachusetts] and, now Malcolm only ate one big meal a day, and so he had had his meal, and so he decided not to, you know, he wasn't going to eat.  So then after, after the meal, you know, (unclear) coffee, so they asked Malcolm, you know, how he wanted his coffee.  He looked at the guy and said, "Straight black" (laughter) you know, and I said, oh, this is going to be an interesting evening.  So we come out of the faculty club and, and to walk down to where the lecture is, is going to be held and there's a huge crowd and you can't get through and Malcolm (snaps fingers) like snaps his finger or something and suddenly like the Red Sea, the crowd parts, the Fruit of Islam, his personal guard, were all there and they just--the Cambridge [Massachusetts] police were absolutely helpless, they couldn't do a thing.  Malcolm's guys just move the thing, you know, and I said, man, this guy's really, these guys are really organized.  So we walk, we walk down and we were having a pleasant discussion and so forth and so we get there and we, we have the debate.  Now--
Story_ID: 421323
Speaker 1: Just before the debate, a couple of days before, the head of the Ku- the Ku Klux Klan [KKK] in one of the southern areas had said that, "You know, these Nation of Islam people, you know, they aren't bad, you know.  I think I, you know, they don't, they don't believe in drinking, they don't believe in gambling, they don't believe in running around with white women."  So, I, I quoted this and I, and the line that got the, the headline in the paper is, you know, I said, "You know, unfortunately, Mr. Malcolm [Malcolm X], the Nation of Islam has become the best thing to happen to the Ku Klux Klan since the invention of the bed sheet." And, you know, so then it went on from there and, you know, you hear all these gasps from some of, from some of his supporters.  And, you know, so we went on, and we had this debate and then near the end of it, I said to him, you know, I said, "Minister Malcolm, you know, it's all good and, it's all well and good for us to be here, you know, up here in Cambridge [Massachusetts] before this, this audience but, you know, we're really far from the battlefield.  I would suggest, why don't you and I just leave this place and go to--," 'cause this is when the Freedom Rides were all going on, "why don't we just leave this place and go join our brothers and sisters on the bus rides in the South?"  And then I stopped, I said, "Oh, wait a minute, that won't work because if we go on the buses, I'll be sitting in the front, but, but you'll be sitting in the back." Because one of the things that the Nation of Islam believed and preached was that you didn't disobey laws, you know, that, that, and you weren't not--you weren't violent unless someone was violent towards you, but, you know, and this is really a principle, you know, that comes out of, out of Islam itself.  So, you know, so I, you know, all through the debate I kept making these kinds of jabs, you know, saying that, you know, the real fight was in the South and we really should be down there, but, but that the, the Nation of Islam would, would not get engaged, you know, that they would follow the law and so forth.  And so, you know, it was a, it was a fascinating, it was a fascinating night. And I remember reading the, I guess it was the--was it the call? The Nation of Islam newspaper?
Speaker 2: The Muhammad Speaks [Muslim Journal].
Speaker 1: Yeah, Muhammad Speaks, that's right, Muhammad Speaks, and they really took off on me in that (laughter) I thought it was really--.  In fact, one of the guys was saying, you know, oh yeah, you know, yeah, Carrington [HistoryMaker Walter C. Carrington] was, you know, was great with the jokes and had the audience laughing, but at the end, people were coming out and were wondering, you know, which one of these guys was from the eighth grade, and which one was from Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], you know, was the saying (laughter), you know, that Malcolm was, you know, was really the intellectual in all of this, but it was a, it was a great time. And I, when I went down to New York [New York], and we'll get to New York time later 'cause that came after, after the Peace Corps, one of the people I became very, very friendly with then, was Betty Shabazz because Betty was, I was with The Africa-America Institute [The African-American Institute; The Africa-America Institute, New York, New York] at the time and Betty was on our advisory committee and, you know, so she and I would talk all the time and so forth.  So, but that, that debate with Malcolm was really a helluva evening.
Speaker 2: You know it's been written about Malcolm that he really wanted to steer the Nation of Islam into the Civil Rights Movement (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --but was kind of shackled by the conservative philosophy of Elijah Muhammad.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well yeah, oh yeah.  There's just no question about that.
Speaker 2: Did you get any indication that that was really true?
Speaker 1: Well, well not, I mean, you know, Malcolm was very faithful in public, you know, to this whole thing but, yeah, but, oh yeah, you heard this and as you talked to people, you know, who were close to him and, you know, and with him, and who, and who, when he left the Nation, you know, who left with him, because he, he was anxious and also he was very anxious in getting them involved in, with Africa and, and overseas, and of course when he made that famous, when he made the Hajj, you know, he came back really, transformed from, by what he had seen and had experienced the, on that trip overseas.
Speaker 2: Right, I think one of the most, some of the most profound statements he made were in reference to him in national politics and, and Africa after he came back.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  Now, you know, and, you know, the interesting thing, I mean, when, you know, with Malcolm, you know, if we had been, if we had been talking international stuff, I'm sure that, you know, it wouldn't have been a, you know, a dime's worth of difference between us on this but, but this was, this debate was happening at the time when, when the sit-ins were really at, at their height and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's like six- this is sixty--
Speaker 1: This would have been--
Speaker 2: Fifty-nine [1959], '60 [1960]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was '59 [1959] or '60 [1960], I can't remember, it was one.  It might have been '60 [1960], yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I think '60s [1960s], when the Freedom Rides were starting up and they were after--
Speaker 1: Yeah, but, but you had CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] and these people all going down there from here.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.  It's a time with some horrendous violence, you know--
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh yeah, yes.
Speaker 2: --against some of the Freedom Riders.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, there's no question about it.
Speaker 2: Burn a bus in Annis- Alabama and really a lot of bad stuff.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was, it was a tough time.
Story_ID: 421324
Speaker 1: During your time at Peace Corps, there's so much, such a fervor to volunteer in the United States--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --a lot of people went from college campuses--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) to join SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --was it hard to get Peace Corps volunteers then for--
Speaker 2: No, they, they would, they were still, they were still getting them.  I mean, because, you know, there was a, I mean this fervor on, you know, on the campuses and this feeling of activism covered a lot of different, a lot of different interest in the, you know, in a lot of different areas.  No, the Peace Corps during the '60s [1960s] I think that was probably their strongest, their strongest period, you know, so we, we continued to get, to get recruits.  We began to run into problems with the Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] administration because you were getting situations overseas where Peace Corps volunteers, certainly not returned volunteers, but actually serving when the, when the secretary of state made a trip, they would be in the audience and they would turn, they would stand up and turn their backs to him, you know, that kind of thing because they were, they were protesting the Vietnam War.
Speaker 1: There's also like the dual, kind of a dual identity for America in Africa in those days.  You have like the, one thing I think, I think about a lot is the, and I remember a lot of it even when I was a kid watching TV with the brief career of Patrice Lumumba (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yes, oh yes.
Speaker 1: --as prime minister of Congo--
Speaker 2: Oh yes, oh yes.
Speaker 1: --and the subsequent revelation about U.S. involvement--
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: --of his assassination.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, no, no, that was, that was very big and that, you know, there were protests at the United Nations [UN] and that was sort of the first real big public demonstration of black Americans protesting policy on Africa and, you know, it was big and I was in Sierra Leone at the time when Lumumba was killed and, you know, I, and I remember the reaction of Sierra Leoneans to this whole thing, it was really bad.  You know, as you say, yeah, and more and more information came out about how this whole thing was engineered by the, by the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency].  You know, it was, it was one of the darkest moments for American- for America and Africa.
Speaker 1: Did you have any sense of, I don't--the Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] administration, were they aware, really aware what was going on?  Did they have any sense of really (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, you know, what, I mean it was sort of like the Bay of Pigs, it was something that Kennedy inherited because this happened under Eisenhower [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower], you know, and, I mean, well, it was, it was put into motion--
Speaker 1: Into motion during Eisenhower.
Speaker 2: --into motion during Eisenhower.  And one of the things that Kennedy found as a result of, after the Bay of Pigs was that he really had to get greater control over the CIA because, you know, they were off doing these kind of rogue things and, you know, so that the protests against the killing of Lumumba, I think, woke up a lot of people in the administration, you know, that things really had to, you know, that they really had to get control of covert action and then, of course the Bay of Pigs happened later, on that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know, I know some have considered Carter's [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] relationship to CIA and other things too as, it seems as though, though you may have a liberal minded president, he's not in control of everything that's going on, you know, (unclear) handle on all (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, well, he can be, you know, he can be and I'm trying to think whether, yeah, and I think, I think during, during the Carter administration, you got the, you got more, I think, more control over some of these things than you had in the past but, you know, it was certainly, it was certainly bad for, for a time, no question about it, these covert operations.

Speaker 1: You were at Peace Corps for ten years--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --with Peace Corps for ten years--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and at the end of ten years, you came back to the U.S., and what happened next?
Speaker 2: Well, okay, well no, I was, I was back, I was six years in Africa, and then four years back here in Washington [D.C.] and ending up with the last two of those four years as director for Africa and, you know, usually the term is five years and then you're supposed to leave, but the way it--by the time the five year rule came in, and they hadn't, they didn't grandfather it so I was able to stay another five years, and I got this, and also I was bumping heads with the Republicans, appointees in the, in the Peace Corps and so I, you know, I figured it was, it was time to leave and because one of the things that happened when I was, when I was there, the reason I got to be director for Africa was that the, the Peace, the last Peace Corps director appointed by Democrats, Jack Vaughn, had offered me the job of general counsel for the Peace Corps, and in fact the announcements had been made and all that, all that kind of stuff and I was, you know, getting ready, picking my staff and all that sort of thing, and then because the, because the Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] people had promised--the secretary of state, in fact, had promised Vaughn that they weren't going to make any changes but then they did and they brought in this fellow Joe, Joe Blatchford [Joseph Blatchford], and I remember Blatchford calling me in and said, "Look, I've got about a hundred Republican lawyers that want this job, you know, and I, you know, and there's no way I can, I cannot appoint one of them to the job, but I'd like you to stay on." And he said, "Would you be willing to stay on as director for Africa?"  So I thought about it for a while and decided that, you know, we really needed to have some of the old crew there, you know, if nothing else, to keep a watch on these guys, and plus being director for Africa was something I really thought I'd enjoy doing and so I did.  I stayed on and in the second year began, you know, I was having more and more disagreements with some of the appointees and so I was looking around and got this offer to come down to be the number two man at The Africa-America Institute [The African-American Institute; The Africa-America Institute] in New York [New York].  The Africa-America Institute was the major private organization in the United States dealing with Africa. We--
Speaker 1: That's the one founded by Hansberry [William Leo Hansberry] way back when?
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --founded by Hansberry and these guys, and white guys came along and took it over.  You know, so, so that when I went there, there had never been a president, there never had been a head of The Africa-America Institute who was black and my hope was that I would, you know, be there and move up and become head of the, head of it.  So I was there for, for about ten years with them.  In addition to being executive vice president, I was also publisher of the magazine, Africa Report, which was then the leading magazine on Africa, published in the United States.
Speaker 1: That's right, that was really an important publication too (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, and you know, we ran, you know, we, we had a contract with the AID, U.S. government AID [United States Agency for International Development], to handle all graduate fellowships, scholarships in Africa.  And so we did that and we gave scholarships to a lot of people and we, and so we had to work with a lot of the liberation movements because we were giving special scholarships to, to them even before they became, became independent.
Story_ID: 421326
Speaker 1: I spent ten years with them [at The African-American Institute; The Africa-America Institute, New York, New York] and then Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.], you know, won the, won the election in 1980 [sic. 1976] and Louis Martin [Louis E. Martin], who was one of Carter's top aides and someone whom I first met, in fact, in Nigeria when, when I was there with the Experiment in International Living, the summer I spent there back in '59 [1959], and Louis was there 'cause, you know, Louis's a generalist and he was there helping the newspaper there, working with the newspaper there that summer and we got to know each other quite well.  And so, Louis gives me a call and says, "Well, President Carter is interested in appointing you to an ambassadorship."  He said, "Now, I've forgotten which country," he said, "you know, but would you be interested?"  And I said, "Yeah, I think," I said, "Yeah I think I would." And just about that time, I had to go down to Washington [D.C.] for something else, they were having a big meeting on--I've forgotten the exact, the exact issue, but Carter had called together all of the big names in foreign policy, et cetera, and some other people and some (unclear) in Africa to talk about, to talk about Africa and I remember arriving there with Randall Robinson and I've forgotten somebody else, and, you know, all these people are coming up in these limousines, et cetera, you know, and we, we're walking in, and we, you know, we walk in and have this meeting, and they were proposing some stuff that I thought was way off the wall, and I raised my hand and, and said, you know, asked the president, you know, some things about this and said, you know, I thought it was the wrong way to approach it and so forth and so on.  Anyway, at the end of the meeting, you know, we, we come out of the White House [Washington, D.C.] and all these limousines pull up, you know, and the press is all there wanting to talk to all these big names, and all these guys are jumping into limousines.  And so Randall and I, with no limousine, had to walk down to grab a cab and so the reporters all grab us and so I end up on the news that night, sort of criticizing me, and I said, oh my god, you know, I'm sure, I'm sure this is going to kill my chances, but it didn't, and Carter, Carter appointed me to Senegal and I arrived in Senegal late in 1980, no, I guess 1981 it must, no, no, it was, this was '80 [1980], yeah.  It couldn't have been '80 [1980] because Carter, the election took place (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Carter was elected in '76 [1976].
Speaker 1: Oh, that's right, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry, yeah, that's right, so yeah, it was '80 [1980].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I knew it was '80 [1980], okay.  And so I arrived there in 1980, yeah, in '80 [1980], and in September, and the elections are going to be, are going to be held in November and there was a delegation visiting from the United States and I took them out to one of the most remote corners of Senegal, and I took my radio with me because I wanted to listen, listen to the results, you know, and I woke up maybe an hour later than I should have, but I figured fine, you know, that's no problem, you know, 'cause this was going on all night.  I turn on the thing, of course, within that hour it was all over.
Story_ID: 421327
Speaker 1: You know, they announced that Reagan [Ronald Wilson Reagan] had won and so, you know, I figured, uh oh, and I, you know, I hadn't been there [Senegal] very long and shortly after that, a congressional delegation comes through and a friend of mine on the delegation tells me that I and the ambassador in Mali, Anne Holloway Forrester [sic. Anne Forrester Holloway], who used to work for Andy Young [HistoryMaker Andrew Young], the two of us were at the top of Chet Crocker's hit list.  Chet Crocker was the guy who was handling the transition f- the (unclear) Africa transition for Reagan and later became assistant secretary of state for Africa. That (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Chester Crocker, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that we were at the top of the hit list, that they were going to get rid of us as quickly as possible.  So come January and the new president is installed, I get a cable from Secretary of State Haig [Alexander Haig] thanking me for my services and giving me two weeks to get the hell out of the country.  And interestingly enough, two senators came to my support, two of the most unlikely senators you could imagine, Bob Dole, and from Mississippi, Trent Lott. This is because people who knew me knew them.  One, one, one, one woman who was there in Senegal had grown up across the street from the, from the Dole family and so she had gotten ahold of Dole and they had, they had come and urged them to let me stay at least until my successor was, was named in to come, this was in January or February, and it turned out that they didn't send anybody to replace me until August, but nevertheless, you know, they, you know, I had to leave in spite of all of this and once I left post, they then sent a message back to the two senators' offices saying, oh, you know, oh, we didn't get around to, if we had known this, you know, we would have let him stay and all this sort of thing, but they weren't about to let me stay and one of the reasons they didn't want me to stay was because they were in the process of reversing Carter's [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] policy towards South Africa.  As Chester Crocker put it, they were going to stop treating South Africa like a polecat and they didn't want me to, to see the cables.  Well, I got to see some of the cables as they, you know, some of the early cable and was just, very, very clear what they were, what they were doing and they wanted to get, get me and anyone, anyone else like me out of there.
Story_ID: 421328
Speaker 1: So I, I came back and Vernon Jordan [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.] talked to President Cheek [HistoryMaker James Cheek] at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] and said, "You know, Howard really ought to have an international program, and you ought to get Walter Carrington [HistoryMaker Walter C. Carrington], who's just come back as ambassador to, to Senegal to head it."  And so, I went to meet Cheek and ended up spending much longer at Howard than I thought because I thought Democrats would come back in, you know, so I was there for the restoration, you know, waiting for the Democrats to come so I guess I ended up spending about ten years at Howard, developing an international program for them and so I was, you know, in, in Washington [D.C.] during, during this time.  Then left Howard and got some offers of visiting professorships and one was at a small college in Maryland, Washington College [Chestertown, Maryland], spent a semester there.  Then, next semester spent at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] as a visiting professor, and then went out to Marquette in Wisconsin [Marquette University, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] as a visiting professor.  So I, you know, I had three, I had three, three semesters doing this.  And I really enjoyed the teaching and the researching and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: I was just wondering, you know, you're at Milwaukee [Wisconsin] and Marquette University, students coming into your classroom had any idea of where you'd been and what you do (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, it was--
Speaker 2: I mean, I don't know, it just seems like it's--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, it was a fascin- Marquette was was a fascinating, a fascinating place to be and, you know, I was, South Africa, of course, was, was the big issue and, you know, that was an issue as I was speaking about around the country on the whole question, the whole thing in South Africa and I was a board member of TransAfrica [TransAfrica Forum; TransAfrica].  I was orig- one of the, on the original board of, of TransAfrica so I, you know, I kept, I kept active in African things.
Speaker 2: Yeah, TransAfrica was, at one time, famous for planting trees and that at one time--
Speaker 1: No--
Speaker 2: --one of the pioneers in--
Speaker 1: No, they weren't, no, no, it wasn't TransAfrica.
Speaker 2: No, no, not TransAfrica, I'm talking about the other one.
Speaker 1: OIC [Opportunities Industrialization Centers] or--
Speaker 2: No, the, I'm sorry--
Speaker 1: Oh, you're talking about, you're talking about James Robinson's group, Crossroads Africa [Operation Crossroads Africa]?
Speaker 2: Africare, is what I'm talking about (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, okay, yeah, yeah, Africare, some of that.  So, yeah, I was also on the board of Africare at the time so I was on the board of both Africare and TransAfrica while I was in, while I was in Washington.  And then I, then I came back to Washington from Marquette and, let me, let me get the seque- oh yeah, get the sequence right, I went to work with the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, Washington, D.C.--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --of--and helping them to develop some international programs and working on human rights.
Speaker 2: Okay, with [HistoryMaker] Eddie Williams, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 421329
Speaker 1: So we're around 1991, now, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah and so, yeah, so I'm back in Washington [D.C.], working with the Joint Center on Political and Economic Affairs [sic. Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, Washington, D.C.]--
Speaker 1: Before we go, is there any major, is there one major theme in all these years of, you know, working--
Speaker 2: Well, well I think the theme, essentially, you know, I worked on really, on really two things in my life, civil rights and Africa.  I mean, those have been, have been the two things, it's really been working on issues concerning black people.  I mean, that's, that's been my major, my major thing ever since, ever since college [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Okay, right, but I guess in terms of African affairs after a certain time period, I think, I think the South Africa struggle like kind of takes over for a lot of people, I guess the major (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, no, yeah, I was, yeah, I would say, yeah I've been very involved in that.
Speaker 1: --I know especially in the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: When I was, when I was in New York [New York], and when I was in Washington, in fact when I was in New York, working with The Africa-America- Africa-American Institute [The African-American Institute; The Africa-America Institute, New York, New York], I would often have to go to Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland because we had, we had programs there.  In order to get to any of those three countries, you'd have to go through South Africa.  You have to go to the airport there and then fly out.  And what would happen, if you didn't have a visa, and they wouldn't give me a visa, I would have to stay overnight in the airport.  I couldn't leave the airport, and they had accommodations there, you know, like a hotel there that you would stay at.  And so, every time I'd go, you know, I would go through the motions of applying for a visa and always they would, they would find a reason to turn me down.  And then one day my secretary comes running in and saying, "They gave you a transit visa," which meant that I wouldn't have to stay in the airport, that I could leave the airport and, you know, go into town, do anything I wanted as long, you know, and I would give them my itinerary, you know, and you know, I might come in on Tuesday and leave on Wednesday or Thursday to go to one of these countries and that sort of thing.  So as soon as I got that, I changed my whole itinerary.  I got the airline schedules and found out if I arrived in, on Tuesday and there was a flight to Botswana on Wednesday, a flight to Lesotho on Thursday, and, or a flight to Swaziland on Saturday, I would take the Swazi- I would make Swaziland my first stop.  In other words, so I could get, you know, the thing, so, you know, I'd do it every time 'cause I go to Swaziland and then I'd have to fly back to, to Johannesburg [South Africa] and then I would, I had Lesotho still to go to and I had Botswana to go to and, again, I would go to whichever one was furthest away so I'd get, so I could spend the maximum amount of days, so I was able to go up to, to Soweto [South Africa] and see people there and I got to meet--this is before Steve Biko was killed, got to meet him and, and some of his, some of his people.  And I was carrying some money and other stuff for, for the anti-apartheid people in South Africa.  So, you know, I got to have a really, it was a really fascinating, fascinating trip.  When I came back, I wrote an article on it for the, for Africa Report.  And so, you know, I, I got to go to South Africa, you know, and come back and write about it and continue to, to, to speak and talk about it because that, that was the major issue in the, in the '70s [1970s] and '80s [1980s].
Story_ID: 421330
Speaker 1: The big uprising in Soweto [South Africa], I know that was like national news, right, for a long time (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, right, right, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That, that happened after my visit there.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Soweto uprising, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and, you know, we, again, through The Africa-America Institute [The African-American Institute; The Africa-America Institute, New York, New York] and the programs we had, provided scholarships, meant that we were providing these through the ANC [African National Congress] and, you know, other, other liberation organizations for South Africa, for Namibia and for Zimbabwe.
Speaker 1: What was your impression of Steve Biko and Winnie Mandela and others (unclear)--
Speaker 2: I didn't meet, I never met Winnie--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but, you know, very, you know, Steve and the people around him were, you know, were very impressive.  I mean, you know, these guys really, really knew what the situation was, you know, and, you know, and it was clear that, that what happened a year later was going to happen.  I mean, that's the one thing, one of the things I wrote about.  I remember, I remember quoting, at the end of my article, quoting, quoting Yeats' [William Butler Yeats] poem because there was a woman, a young woman who was arrested named Beauty Elangwe [ph.] or something and we had a picture in the article showing her, you know, giving the fist of defiance and yelling Amandla which means freedom.  And so I ended up with the Yeats quote saying that, even though most people don't realize it, "A terrible beauty is being born," ['Easter, 1916'] and that, you know, that this thing was about to explode and it did.  And it was just clear, talking, you know, talking to these people, that, that this explosion was about to take place.
Speaker 1: Now when did you get the first indication that Nelson Mandela was going to be released?
Speaker 2: Not until, not until, not until it happened.  You know, that, you know, that was an incredible moment, but--
Speaker 1: Did it take you by surprise?
Speaker 2: Somewhat, in the sense that, you know, first of all, when de Klerk [F.W. de Klerk] was appointed, I was then in, at Marquette [Marquette University, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] and I remember making a talk, you know, talking about de Klerk and pointing out that he was a lot more conservative than people thought and I was very pessimistic about what would happen. But what took place between his election as the head of the Afrikaner Party [National Party], was the increased anti-apartheid action in this country and the pressure, the increased pressure that was, that was being put on the, on the white establishment and the, and I think they all came to realize that they had a lot more to lose by continuing this hard line than by, by finding a way to, to compromise and that the only thing that could be done was to release Mandela.  Now, when Mandela was released, it was a shock.  One of the great shocks was no one knew what Mandela looked like because the last pictures we had seen of Mandela was, were taken twenty-seven years ago.  So nobody knew what he, you know, what he looked like now and what he was about to say.  It was one of the most electric moments of my life, you know, to see this living legend, you know, suddenly released and making the speech and then when he came here on his, on his trip, that TransAfrica [TransAfrica Forum; TransAfrica] arranged for him to come to the United States, it was just, just an amazing, an amazing thing.  And I, I write about that and some other story.  I wrote, I wrote a couple of things for the, for the Joint Center [Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, Washington, D.C.] magazine, a historical analysis of black American's involvement with Africa and ending with the visit of Mandela here.
Speaker 1: Do you have an opinion--what's your personal opinion of what was a, what do you think was the crucial, what actually kicked it over the edge, you know, and made the South African government, you know, release him and, and--
Speaker 2: Well, I think, as I say, I think the continuing threat of sanctions which, you know, I think a lot of that has to do with the work of TransAfrica and Randall Robinson.  I think, I think Randall Robinson, you know, deserves tremendous credit for, for what he was able to organize and I think it became clear, because the idea of the sanctions was to put pressure on the white establishment and to have them then put pressure on de Klerk and that's in fact what, what happened.  And so, they realized that the only hope they had was, was to release Mandela.  And, of course, once Mandela was released, then things got beyond, got beyond the control of the, of the white establishment there.
Story_ID: 421331
Speaker 1: I don't want to jump too far ahead, but 1993 you get a chance to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, okay, yeah, and I think it's, well, leading up to that, I mean, I, you know, I come back here, you know, I'm back in Washington [D.C.], I'm working for the Joint Center [Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, Washington, D.C.] and then I go to work up on the Hill [Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.] for Mervyn Dymally [HistoryMaker Mervyn M. Dymally], who was at that time the chairman of the Subcommittee on Africa.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I go up there as the chief of staff of his Washington office and so, you know, get very involved, you know staying, staying involved in Africa policy during the time I'm there.  And so I, I spent time there until he, until he retired from, from--he didn't run for reelection.  And then I did consulting, went on some trips organized by the National Democratic Institute [Washington, D.C.] to observe elections in Africa, went with President Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] to Zimbabwe to observe that election and went to, went to Angola and other, and other countries involved in that. And then when the election campaign came about, I started doing some things on Africa for the, for Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] and especially got involved deeply right after the election, in that period between the election and the takeover, that three or four-month, fo- three or four-month period and I was asked, along with another fellow, to develop an Africa policy, all Africa policy recommendations for, for the Clinton administration.  And then, you remember George Bush the first [President George Herbert Walker Bush] sent troops into Somalia to end the famine there.  I think that was the one noble act of George Bush's career, sending the troops, now this is after he, you know, he's a lame duck and he sends the troops because that was the only thing that could be done to open up the supply lines so that people could be fed because people were just dying, you know, in great numbers.  So, he, he does that, but he presents the Clinton administration with a real problem because they're going to inherit this.  So, Sandy Berger, who later becomes the, the foreign--the national security chief for, for Clinton, asks me and, and a fellow named Dick Moose [Richard M. Moose], who had been the assistant secretary of state for Africa under Carter, to come up with a plan for them for Somalia, what should they do when they, when they get in.  So, you know, I, so I spent, I spent a lot of time with Dick on that and wrote the, and wrote a proposal.  Unfortunately, they went much, much further than we had recommended and got deeply involved and tried to turn what was a humanitarian effort into a nation-building effort with, with disastrous consequences going after Aidid [Mohamed Farrah Aidid] who was the leader of one of the major groups in, in Somalia and then the killing of the soldiers and all of that--
Speaker 1: The Black Hawk Down incident [Battle of Mogadishu], oh yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, the Black Hawk Down incident, which became a disaster for American policy because, as a result of that, the United States sort of decided that we aren't going to get involved anymore, the Clinton administration wasn't going to get involved in Africa if it, you know, in anything that would require troops.
Story_ID: 421332
Speaker 1: And this, I think, was, was Clinton's [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] great, great weakness because, you know, Clinton made, made some nice appointments, for example, appointing--what's his name--the former congressman from Mississippi [Mike Espy], as the, as the secretary, as secretary for, for agriculture.  You know, agriculture had been a plantation, the most bigoted department in the government.  And so he went in there and made some real changes.  Now, the Clinton people, and the blacks who were his top advisors, were all people focused on domestic issues, and Clinton himself was focused on domestic issues, and so he didn't make the kind of shakeup he should have done in the state department [U.S. Department of State].  He did appoint Cliff Wharton [HistoryMaker Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] as number two, but then didn't support him, and as soon as the problem came, undercut him and Cliff Wharton got blamed for stuff that he shouldn't have gotten blamed for, and the guys who were really should have gotten blamed for it, didn't.  And I think that was Clinton's great weakness that he, he just didn't pay the attention to foreign policy that he should have.  So when Rwanda came along, for example, we did nothing.  We did worse than nothing because not only did we not intervene, we stopped others from intervening.  At the UN [United Nations], we stopped, we stopped others from intervening and took the side of the, of the Belgians, you know, who wanted no involvement at all, wanted to get the hell out of there and, you know, and so I think that was the most disgraceful part of the Clinton presidency. But, so that, you know, they really didn't pay the kind of attention to foreign policy in those days that, that they really should have.  And so, in, you know, in spite of some good domestic appointments, they weren't doing what they should have done and what they should have done in Africa.  Clinton should have done what Bush [President George Walker Bush] did and appointed a black as secretary of state, but he didn't.
Story_ID: 421333
Speaker 1: We did this thing on Somalia, and then came the long wait, you know, what they call, waiting for the call from the White House.  And while I'm waiting, they ask me to go out to Niger to represent Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] at the inauguration of the newly-elected president [Mahamane Ousmane] there.  So I go out heading the mis- heading a mission for them.  I get back, when I get back from the mission, I check my phone calls and find that the White House has been trying to, you know, has been trying to reach me. Because what I did on that trip was after doing what I, doing Niger, I stayed on instead of coming right back and visited some other countries to do some other things.  So I come back, I find the call to call the White House.  So I call the White House, and they ask me to come over and then they, they asked me if I would be willing to, to go to Nigeria as, as the ambassador. Now for someone who works in Africa, you know, on African issues, and if you're going to get an ambassadorship in Africa, there's, you know, Nigeria is the top one. Now, South Africa was not yet, you know, at that stage but, South Africa and Nigeria are two big ones but Nigeria was, was really the big one, and it came at a time when it looked as if the new president was going to be Moshood Abiola, who had been elected, and a man whom I knew because he invited me to a conference that he sponsored in England, asked me to come out to, to speak at, a conference on the drought, that was in the late, in the late '80s [1980s] I guess, and I went out to, to speak at that conference.  So, you know, having him as president, you know, someone whom I knew, you know, I thought would be great. And, of course, between the time that I was, that I was nominated and the time I finally went out there, they annulled the election, and so he, he, he could never take his office and so I was, I was, I went out there and presented my credentials to an interim president, and two weeks after I was there, the military took over again and Sani Abacha became the head of state and so for four years I had to deal with, I had to deal with him.  And I--
Speaker 2: Was Abiola free at this time or I mean at one point, okay he was still free (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, Abiola was, was free for about a year or more while I was there.  In fact, I remember coming back here on, on leave because Nigeria was participating in the Olympics [1996 Summer Olympics, Atlanta, Georgia], the, their soccer team, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Super Eagles.
Speaker 1: And, yeah, Super Eagles, right, and they had a big match here in Boston [Massachusetts], and I got, you know, they got tickets for me so I had these front row tickets, everything, you know great thing, I was going to, I was coming back for that, and while I'm back here, I get a call early in the morning from the state department [U.S. Department of State] saying they've just arrested Abiola, you need to get back to Nigeria right away.  So I gave the tickets to my sister [Marilyn Carrington], head back to, head back to Nigeria and then things really started to go badly.  The Nigerian government sort of--Abacha sort of regarded me as foreign enemy number one saying that I was out there not representing Clinton's views but really the views of the Black Caucus [Congressional Black Caucus], and that I was being too strident, too critical of them, that I was in bed with the human rights people and so things, things went from, from bad to worse (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What an accusation, to be accused of being--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.
Speaker 2: --associated, I mean, in bed with human rights people.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, well that was the thing, I mean, and so, you know, I got very involved in that and was making statements all the time, knowing again that I, you know, how far could I push the envelope because we had sanctions at that time against the Nigerian government, three different sets of sanctions, and, you know, the last thing that the White House back here wanted to be accused of was cozying up to the Nigerian government so I knew I could continue to, to, to push on this and, and I did.
Story_ID: 421334
Speaker 1: And in fact, when I was getting ready to leave, I was there for four years, usually the term is three years, and all during that time, the Nigerian government kept saying, you know, they kept planting (unclear)--things in the paper that the Americans were going to recall me because I was, you know, I was not representing their views and all that kind of stuff.  And so finally when, when I was getting ready to leave after being there for four years, the human rights groups and the, and the pro-democracy groups all got together to give me a farewell party.  Now, you, you know, when you're leaving post, there are all kinds of farewell parties, you know, do you have an, they're usually not, not much thought of, you know, I mean, you know, there isn't a big thing in the press.  Well, this government had the tendency to shoot itself in the foot.  And so, for this, for this party, my wife [HistoryMaker Dr. Arese Carrington] and I go to the, to the venue where the party is supposed to be, we get there, we find it surrounded by tanks and the guy who was there in charge of the operation says, "Oh, Mr. Ambassador, we didn't know you were coming here tonight.  If we had known, we could have put this operation off 'til tomorrow, but we heard that people were smuggling arms in here and so we've surrounded the place."  And now the human rights people sort of thought something like this might happen, so they had a plan B, they had a backup place.  And so I get in the car, and they take me to the backup place where they're going to have the party, somewhere deep, you know, in the bowels of Lagos [Nigeria].  And so we get there, and the, the program is beginning, and somebody gets to the mic to introduce me, and then we hear all this banging at these hu- they have these huge steel gates surrounding the compound, and you hear this banging, banging, banging on the, on the gates and finally we see the gates bang through, these big gates get pushed open, you know, I guess they rammed the truck or something into it and they push the gates open and these guys, fully, you know, in uniform, come running in, guns locked and loaded. And the guy who had been in charge of the operation, and who apologized to me for the fact that they had this, that they had blocked the venue, he has his walkie-talkie out and I hear him, he says, "Sir, sir, I can confirm, we are at the party, the ambassador is here and I can confirm that we are about to break the party up," you know, and you know, I get kind of, you know, he's yelling and, you know, and think, and you know, and he's sort of happy that, you know, that he found the place, otherwise who knows what would have happened to him if he had to because it took him about an hour for him to find where we were.  So, he, he tells, you know, tells everybody, you know, to disperse, you know, that this party is finished, you know, he forces us, at gunpoint, to get up.  Now, and he tells them to go up to the guy who's at the microphone, an old man, who was the, sort of the head of the human rights community and says, "Take, take that paper from his hand."  At that point, a fellow named Gani Fawehinmi, who was the big human rights lawyer there and is a big guy, and a real believer in law and order, walks up to the guy and says, "You can't do that," you know, "This is a private home, you cannot break this place up." And then one of the soldiers, whom my wife swears looked like he was on, he was on drugs or something, has his, has his rifle and points it at Gani and says, "Get away or I'll shoot you."  Gani opens his breast, opens his shirt, bears his breast and says, "Shoot."  At that point, the fellow who was in charge of this, the officer in charge runs up and pulls the soldier away realizing, you know, he can have a real major incident here.
Story_ID: 421335
Speaker 1: They break the party up, the word gets out, it becomes the number one news story on the, on the BBC [British Broadcasting Corporation] that night, The Washington Post and The New York Times run editorials on it, a resolution is introduced in the [U.S.] Congress on it, asking the administration [of President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton], you know, to really protest.  Now, the White House, or the state department [U.S. Department of State], does not, does little.  It makes a mealy-mouthed kind of, kind of protest and, now they, they had selected my successor, you know, but they hadn't named him yet. And what they do, you know, and what you ordinarily do in a case like this is you get in touch with the government and says, you know, we aren't sending a new ambassador here until you do A, B, C and D, you're going to make apologies and all this kind of stuff, they don't do that.  They immediately announce my successor while all this is going on.  They never get a real apology from the, from the government and it just became, you know--
Speaker 2: Well you know what the brothers would say and, out here in the bookstores and stuff, they'd say, well, all that oil has (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, yeah, but it wasn't, it wasn't just the oil, it was a whole reason--.  I was talking about the brothers, yeah, this is an important thing to point out.  During all of this, we kept getting delegations of people coming out there of blacks who were being obviously paid by the government to come out there and be apologist for the government.  And so I'm getting into fights with these guys--
Speaker 2: Blacks from the United States?
Speaker 1: From the United States.
Speaker 2: People from, priests from the Episcopal church?
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: Newspaper editors, I've interviewed them (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, yeah, right.
Speaker 2: I've interviewed them and talked about this trip.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It's in this collection.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, they come out there, you know, from the, from the--black Baptists and all this sort of thing.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: They all came out there, and I'm going heads with them, plus Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan] comes out there, you know, and all of these people coming out, making apologies for this government and, you know, and I'm telling these newspaper people, I mean, how in the world can you come out here and do this when the guy they put in prison is the leading publisher, newspaper man in this country, you know, Abiola [Moshood Abiola], you know, and put in prison, and you are coming out here defending the guys who have imprisoned him.
Story_ID: 421336
Speaker 1: And so we kept getting, you know, these, these delegations coming out here--
Speaker 2: Even [HistoryMaker] Carol Moseley Braun came out.
Speaker 1: Especially Carol Moseley Braun came out.  She, she came out (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Our only black senator at that time.
Speaker 1: She, yeah, she came out and, oh boy, she, she came out and didn't tell anybody, just to know.  Usually when a congressman or senator comes to a country, they tell the state department [U.S. Department of State], they, you know, and tell the ambassador and all that, you know, so, so we know.  She didn't tell anybody.  She came out here, and I found out she was here when I was on the plane going up from Lagos [Nigeria] to Abuja [Nigeria] where the, where they were building, where they have their new capital.
Speaker 2: New capital, okay.
Speaker 1: I'm going up there and I'm seeing these people in the plane saying, "Ah, Mr. Ambassador, you're going up.  I guess you're going to be attending the special dinner that the president [Sani Abacha] is giving for the special envoy from the United States?"  I said, "What's--special envoy?"  "Yes, yes, (pronunciation) Ms. Brown," they called her, "Ms. Brown is coming."  I said, "What?"  "Yes, this senator is coming as a special envoy."  And I said, you know, it's the first I heard of it.  So I got, I get to our, to the office up in Abuja, and I sent a cable that, the most undiplomatic cable I've ever sent, and I just race out, I said, "What in the hell is going on?"  I told them all this that happened, you know, and I said, you know, "I've heard nothing about this, you know, why is Carol Moseley Braun coming here?  Why wasn't I told?  And what's she supposed to do?  Is she, in fact, an official envoy sent by the president [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] and if so, why the hell wasn't I told?"  Well, the cable not only went to the state department but the state department sent it up to the Hill [Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.].  Carol Moseley Braun's assistant, the chief of staff gets it, goes through the roof, she didn't know about it.  She resigns, she resigned.  You know, it caused all kinds of hell. Carol Moseley Braun, you know, gets word of all the turmoil that's going back in the states so she calls our house in Lagos, she gets ahold of my wife [HistoryMaker Dr. Arese Carrington] 'cause I'm up in Abuja and so my wife tells her, you know, that I'm, you know, that I'm in Abuja and she should really talk to me up there.  So we were both staying at the same hotel up there so she gets, she gets hold of me, we sit out by the pool.
Story_ID: 421337
Speaker 1: I tell her [HistoryMaker Carol Moseley Braun], you know, you're like a hero, here you are, you know, coming here, meeting with this government, and I went through all the stuff they did and she said, "Oh, you know, they aren't that bad" and all this kind of thing and other kind of thing and blah, blah, blah, you know, and it's only because they're Nigerian and they're black that--. You know, and I said, you know, I just, I just went crazy.  I said, "And you're here and you're not going to meet with any of the opposition?"  She said, "Oh, maybe next time when I come," you know, this kind of crap.  She just went on and I was, I was livid, you know, with her and all this.  I mean, she was, she was a real apologist for this, for this government and she came out there, the state department [U.S. Department of State] didn't know but no one knew, but no one in her office knew about it, you know, and what kind of s- deals she made with this guy [Sani Abacha], I don't know, I don't know, but she was, you know, she was an example of that.
Story_ID: 421338
Speaker 1: The one, the most ironic thing that happened of these guys who came out here, I can't remember the name of the guy, he was the head of the Southern Baptist Convention, anyway, he, he, he came out with his delegation (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You mean the National Baptist Convention or the Southern--
Speaker 1: The Southern--
Speaker 2: The Southern?
Speaker 1: --no, it was the National Baptist--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the National Baptist, yeah.
Speaker 2: This is the black one, right, black?
Speaker 1: The black one, right, the National Baptist Convention.  He came--
Speaker 2: Was this, was this Lyons [Henry Lyons] before--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it was, yeah, it was Lyons.
Speaker 2: --Lyons before he got in trouble and got booted, right.
Speaker 1: (Nods head) Okay. (Laughter) He, he came out there with this, with his group and they got on television, you know, they put him on television on the evening television news, and so they're talking and he, in the television interview, is hustling the Nigerian government for giving a contract to build housing there, you know.  I mean, I couldn't believe it.  Anyway, while he was there, the word got out--because he was, I guess he was traveling with this woman who was not his wife [Deborah Lyons], the word got out, the wife found out about it, I guess burnt down the house, you know, and all his effort, you know, and I told these guys, I said, see, that's what happens with you guys, you come out here and then, you know, and that's the vengeance (laughter) that you're going to get for this but, yeah, Lyons, that's the guy.
Speaker 2: Reverend Henry Lyons, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, right, exactly, you know, and he came out there.  I mean, I mean, I was, I was just, it just drove me, drove me crazy, you know, to see these folks coming out there, apologizing for this government.  You know, this government was the worst the Nigerians have ever had, and they were buying people off, left and right--
Speaker 2: I would like to know, and I just, I know it's puzzled me, I know since that time, I think [HistoryMaker] Carol Moseley Braun has apologized or something about this and other people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did she?  I don't know, did she?  I mean--
Speaker 2: --or people have acknowledged that as a, some people say that's a mistake--
Speaker 1: I don't know, I don't know if she has, you--
Speaker 2: --some have not, you know.
Speaker 1: Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] then appointed her as ambassador to New Zealand--
Speaker 2: That's true--
Speaker 1: --you know?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I don't know.  I mean, I just wonder what, is it just, were they just plain bought off or did they--
Speaker 1: I have no, I, I have no idea, you know.
Speaker 2: --or they were, were they mistaken or what was the, okay.
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm not a psychiatrist, I can't get into heads.
Speaker 2: There were so many, so many of 'em.
Speaker 1: Boy, all I know is what their actions, I know and they just kept coming out there and I, you know, and I just kept, you know, giving them hell and trying to explain to the Nigerians and to the human rights commission [United Nations Commission on Human Rights], you know, community, and pointing out that these people are not representative of the black community in the United States, you know, in this.  They are on their own for whatever, for whatever reasons and it was, it just got to be terrible and, of course, Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan] came out and he tried to make it a fight between Muslims and non-Muslims in Nigeria which was a bunch of crap because the leaders, I mean, some of the people among the Yoruba who were the strongest opponents of Abacha [Sani Abacha] were themselves Muslims.  This guy--
Speaker 2: Yeah, like Moshood Abiola himself.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Moshood Abiola himself.  The guy who I told you who bared his shirt, Gani Fawehinmi, he's a Muslim, a good Muslim, and he, and he attacked, he publicly attacked Farrakhan in the press, but, you know, these people came out there and just trying, trying to, you know, as praise singers for the, for the Abacha regime and it was, it was just terrible.  And so, you know, so I had to spend a lot of time getting, you know, getting, you know, going, going after them on this and trying to explain to the people there, you know, that these were not representatives of the views of blacks in the United States.
Story_ID: 421339
Speaker 1: But (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The Congressional Black Caucus, they had a clear opinion about this, didn't they (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Yeah, most of them but some of them were, were--
Speaker 2: Had they--
Speaker 1: --kind of waffling but, but most of them.
Speaker 2: Was there an official position by the caucus on this?
Speaker 1: There may have, at one point there, I think there was but, you know, once Jefferson [HistoryMaker William Jefferson] switched positions, you know, because Jefferson originally was the strongest supporter of Abiola [Moshood Abiola].  In fact, he was the one responsible for the [U.S.] Congress calling hearings on Nigeria, the first hearings they had in Nigeria in seventeen years and he was the one behind it because he had, before he became a congressman, had been, I guess, a lawyer, had handled legal stuff for Abiola but, but then he came out there, had a private meeting with Abacha [Sani Abacha] and switched.  Now, the guy, the guy who remained faithful throughout, who didn't switch, was Don Payne [Donald M. Payne], he was a real hero.  I mean, he and, he and Randall Robinson here in the United States, you know, really remained strong and kept the pressure on.  They were, they were extremely helpful to me and to other people out there who were doing things, but, but Jefferson, you know, switched and said, you know, maybe we ought to not go, you know, go be as hard on him as we ought, you know, we ought try to find ways to negotiate and all this, all this sort of stuff and he himself made a number of visits out there that we didn't know about.  So, anyway, I won't say anything further than that.  I mean, that's all I can say on that, that's, you know, all I know, I know he made the visits and we didn't know about it until, you know, until after he got there and then we found out.
Story_ID: 421340
Speaker 1: But the result of, of Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan]--he became very popular with Abacha [Sani Abacha].  Now, while I was there, there was a attempt in New York [New York] to get the street corner in front of the Nigerian Mission to the United Nations [Permanent Mission of Nigeria to the United Nations] renamed for Kudirat Abiola, who was the wife of Moshood Abiola, and she was killed by the Abacha people.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) that a car hit her, or something.
Speaker 1: No, no, no, she was shot.
Speaker 2: She was shot?
Speaker 1: She was shot, no car hit her, she was shot, and she was shot, she had, she had met with me, she was at our house the Saturday before, Friday and Saturday, she was at our house, and she was killed on Monday, on her way to the Canadian, to the Canadian embassy 'cause she was at our place, meeting with the, with the assistant secretary for human rights from the state department [U.S. Department of State], and she was, she was shot and killed.  And so, they tried to get the street corner in front of the Nigerian consulate named for, named for her.  The Nigerians were up in arms and they tried all kinds of stuff to stop it, and they, they couldn't.  They slowed it down, but they couldn't stop it.  So they decided, okay, if you do that, we're going to rename the diplomatic enclave in, in Lagos [Nigeria] where all, where the U.S. embassy, the British, the Russians and about twelve embassies were, we're going to rename that Louis Farrakhan, and they put a sign right in front of the embassy for Louis Farrakhan, so it became Louis Farrakhan Crescent. And one of the things I did, when I came, when I came back from Nigeria, after my tour was over, I got very active here in the States in talking about Nigeria and about the Abacha regime, et cetera. And I got involved in the attempt to rename the corner in New York for Kudirat Abiola and I went down and I testified before the city council [New York City Council] there about it and the city council then finally agreed and renamed the corner Kudirat Abiola Corner, and the Nigerians were just furious.  And so, all during Abacha regime, they kept it, the name, Louis Farrakhan Crescent.  My wife [HistoryMaker Dr. Arese Carrington] and I went back to Nigeria after Abacha died and after the elections that brought Obasanjo [Olusegun Obasanjo], the current head of state, to power and while we were there, the, we were there for the inauguration, the governor of Lagos State [Nigeria] announced that they were tearing down the Farrakhan signs and that from now on, the crescent would be called Walter Carrington Crescent. So that diplomatic crescent is now named for me, so (laughter) Farrakhan, I don't know, anyway, so that the, you know, the human rights people who, you know, and the people who were persecuted under Abacha, you know, have now changed, changed things, things around in that country.  And so, you know, that was a very, a very satisfying sort of, sort of thing to, to, to, to see that.
Story_ID: 421341
Speaker 1: So, you know, I say, when I came back, until Abacha's [Sani Abacha] death, I kept very active in trying to increase the pressure on him. In fact I had, when I was ambassador, in my last year there, tried to get the United States to enact stronger sanctions against the Abacha regime to put, to put the oil money in trust, to put economic sanctions on them, et cetera, but couldn't, couldn't, couldn't get them to move that far, but luckily Abacha's regime was ended when he had a--well, no one really knows what the cause, finally, of his death was.  The tragedy was that Abiola [Moshood Abiola] was not immediately released and as a result he died in prison and that was a shame.  While he was in prison, Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] came out and it was interesting because when Jesse came out, the human rights people were opposed to Jesse's visit and the government was in favor of it, and they were opposed because they said that Jesse was too close to Abacha and they made all kinds of stuff.  Anyway, Jesse came out and actually turned things around. And, by the time he came back, when he was getting ready to leave, we had a reception for him at the, at the residence and we invited all the human rights people and they began to sang, sing his praises but while he was there, they allowed Jesse and I to go in to visit Aba- Abiola in prison and while we were there, Jesse said a prayer for him and all this kind of thing, we held hands and we talked and all those kind of thing, and a week later the foreign minister called me in and said, you know, criticized me for some of the discussions we had had with, with Abiola, and he said to me, "Did you think that your meeting with him would be inaudible to us?" You know (laughter) in other words they heard everything goddamn, everything that, that we had said, but, but Jesse's whole thing, and so the government became very angry at Jesse because of the meeting with Abiola, and also because Jesse, when Jesse and I had this meeting with Abacha and a couple of his people, and Jesse was making all kinds of, asked him all kinds of questions, which were critical of things they were doing and he said, "Well that's wrong, that's wrong, where'd you get that from?"  And Jesse said, well, that's what the ambassador told me.  So after that, I was really persona non grata with, with them, but, but Jesse did well when he, when he came out, not like so many of these others who, who were there.
Speaker 2: That's to his credit, I would guess (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it is to his credit.
Story_ID: 421342
Speaker 1: But, you know, that was, that was an exciting, an exciting time. That, you know they had two plots against me, the Nigerians had two attempts, well, two plots that they had, they had developed to, to kill me, but luckily our people found out about it and were able to, to abort it--
Speaker 2: I think rare has any, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) but the, I mean, this is, yeah, this is, this is very rare for the government to whom you're accredited to be plotting against you, but they, you know, they really began to dislike me tremendously, which was okay with me you know.  I didn't have much love for them.
Speaker 2: Well, I think what's puzzling to me is the, it's not puzzling but I just don't, I probably shouldn't even say this but I just wonder if any of the democratic administrations really have a clue as to foreign--I mean, if they can really exercise much control over U.S. foreign policy (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Well, well they can if they want to.  They can if they want to.  I mean, yeah, they can.  I mean, you know, this idea that there's a secret cabal, no, no.  The president can, can control, can control foreign policy, there's no question, I mean, he control--I mean--
Speaker 2: You know exactly what I'm talking about?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I mean, look, you know, if the Republicans do it, I mean, look at Bush [President George Walker Bush].  Bush, you know, has his policy, even though 80 percent of the country's against it, the [U.S.] Congress is against it, he's got his policy, you know, yeah.  You've got to be tough and you've got to have the right people in there. And, and as I say, I think Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] in his first term was just not that, just not that concerned.  I mean, foreign policy was not the big, the big thing for him, you know, domestic issues were and, you know, he, he, Clinton's a very smart guy and he does his homework and he spent time, but he left foreign policy pretty much, especially in Africa, to others. And, you know, it was, you know, there were all these, all these problems that, that happened as a res- .  I remember coming back once, every year, they bring all the ambassadors back for a conference and I remember one of the ambassadors is from I don't know, from Latin America or from, I don't know, I've forgotten where he was stationed, he said, "Oh, you're in Nigeria, boy things must really be tough there."  He said, "Yeah, how do you get along with that government?"  I looked at him, I said, "Which government?" Because (laughter) I was having as much problems with the American government at that time as I was, as I was having with the Abacha [Sani Abacha] government but, anyway, that, but those four years were, were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This is '93 [1993] to '97 [1997]?
Speaker 1: Ninety-three [1993] to '97 [1997], yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --all right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I went there, I went there in November of ninety--arrived in November of '97 [1997] and left there September, or No- November '93 [1993], left there September of '97 [1997].
Story_ID: 421343
Speaker 1: Okay, so, well what happened when you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was October, I guess, '97 [1997].
Speaker 1: --when you finally, you know, I guess, decompressed from all that, all that activity, what happened (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, I was offered a fellowship at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] by Skip Gates [HistoryMaker Henry Louis "Skip" Gates, Jr.] at the Du Bois Institute [Du Bois Institute for Afro-American Research; W.E.B. Du Bois Research Institute, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And so I came back and spent a year there as a fellow, as a resident fellow.  I'm still a fellow there but I'm a non-resident status but I was a f- I came back for that year as a fellow and began working on my book.  I'm planning to write a book on Nigeria.  I've been planning for a long time but, you know, I've got to finish it and so I spent a year doing that. And then I got an offer to be a distinguished visitor at the, at the MacArthur Foundation [John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation], and so I went to Chicago [Illinois] for the fall, I guess it was the fall term of '98 [1998], the fall semester of '98 [1998], and so I was a distinguished visitor there and continued to, to do research and writing. And then after that, I came back here, that would get me, what, we're at '98 [1998]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: What did I, what did I do between, between then--and, and, I did, I did various, various sorts of, sorts of things.  When I, I continued to be a fellow at the Du Bois Institute and then I was offered a professorship at Simmons College in Boston [Massachusetts], it's an all-girls school in Boston.  They have a rotating professorship.  They bring in ambassadors and other practitioners for a two-year stint, and so I'm now finishing my third year there, my third and final year there where I'm teaching courses on U.S. foreign policy in Africa and Islam in Africa.
Speaker 1: So you started there in, what, 2005?
Speaker 2: Five [2005], yeah.
Speaker 1: Two thousand five [2005], okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Either '04 [2004] or '05 [2005], I guess.
Story_ID: 421344
Speaker 1: When you look back at everything you've done to this point, now this has been so many things, and so- and some intense things, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: Now that's kind of, that's kind of hard to say because, I mean the real juncture in my career happened when I was made the offer with the Peace Corps because I had a choice of staying here, and domestically--'cause at, you know at that time, I mean, I think I could have had a very good political career here in Massachusetts.  I was very well-known and so forth, but the idea of this new organization of the Peace Corps, which is something I believe in very much and the chance to live in Africa, and I thought when I went there that I'd only be there for, for two years, you know, and I'd come back, resume my political career here, and resume my law career and that didn't happen because I just enjoyed what I was doing so much.  And so I, you know, continued in the international sphere of, so you know, it's hard to say that I would, in terms of career things that I would really, that I would really make a, make a different, a different choice.  I mean, you know, I wish I could have had, well I wish I could have had the political career and had the Africa experience but, you know, I had to choose. And by the time I came back to Massachusetts, which is my home, I grew up here, by the time I came back, I had been away for almost forty years 'cause I left here in '61 [1961] and, or '60 [1960], I left here in '60 [1960], and came back here in '97 [1997] so that's thirty-seven years that I've been away from Massachusetts.

Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well my, well, my hope, first of all, I hope we avoid something and that is, I hope we avoid the tribalism that has so badly affected so much of Africa, and I say that in terms of the current can- the current candidature of Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] because I'm disturbed when I hear these programs where they bring up black people who say that he's not black enough, you know, that there's a test of blackness.  I mean, the thing that has made blacks so strong and able to succeed is that we never had a, we never had a political test that blacks, you know, no matter how light or dark you were, we were all blacks.  No matter how mu- now that test of who's black may have been one that was adopted by the slave owners and others.  You had a drop of blood, you were black, but I think that worked in our, that worked to our advantage and I think to the extent that we see ourselves as black regardless of whether our ancestors were slaves or not, the fact that we all originally came from Africa, I think that's very important.  I think that this, this increasing thing that I hear that blacks are, are not sure they're going to support a black candidate like Obama because of the fact that his father came from, from Kenya, you know, and he was not, you know, was not a slave here, I think is very dangerous and I think goes, goes against us.  Again, this whole thing of, of blacks saying, of black people saying, you know, they're multiracial, you know, and they're not black, is something that I find, I find extremely, extremely disturbing.  You know, I think that the problem, the great problem facing the black community still is the problem of poverty, that we have got to do everything we can to lift as many of our brothers and sisters out of poverty as possible because I am convinced that you know, in this, this may be a minority opinion, that the racial climate in the United States is different from, from what--substantially different from what it was when I was coming up and I think it is.  I mean, people say, you know, other people will say, well, you know, I like Obama, but he's black, and they'll never elect a black president.  I don't believe that.  I believe that, that a black can be elected president in this country.  And so, you know, I think that we continue to bear too many of the scars of slavery, you know, and the feeling that, that we can, we can never succeed that white people never will.  I mean, one of the advantages for me of having grown up the way I did in Everett [Massachusetts] is that, you know, white people are not giants, you know.  They're no, you know, I mean, I understand them as, you know, just ordinary folk.  I mean, you know, that, you know, so many, so many black folk think that white people are smarter and abler to do things and they are--. That's bull, that's B.S., you know.  I mean, I grew up, I grew up among them, you know.  I mean, I, I competed against them, you know, in high school [Everett High School, Everett, Massachusetts], you know, when there were very few of them and I was as smart or smarter than any of them, you know, and I've done it in college [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], in law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  You know, so that, you know, they are no mystery to me and, you know, and so I think we have just got to get our act together that we, we have political power that we just haven't used and, you know, and I think it's important to get as many blacks registered and voting, you know, and these black people will say, you know, who say, oh, you know, we shouldn't get involved in politics 'cause, you know, we can't win, you know, and so forth, that's B.S.
Story_ID: 421346
Speaker 1: I mean, the one thing we have, the one thing that politicians fear is the vote.  I mean, that's what, what changed the attitudes of so many politicians in the South was when black people got to vote they then, they then had to cater to them.  They had to moderate their, their stands, you know, I mean, that's the most important weapon we have.  Other people, other communities have money and so forth, we have, we have the vote.  We have millions of people that we have just got to continue to organize and we've got to put our emphasis on ending poverty.  I mean, our middle class is bigger, stronger than ever it was but that middle class cannot abandon those who are, who are left behind.  I mean, that's, that's our job, I mean, that's what we've got to do and this question of poverty is a worldwide question.  I mean, that's the great problem in Africa too, is attacking poverty.  You know, until you, until you bring people out of poverty, you're not going to, you're not going to make the progress.  Look, I grew up in Massachusetts at a time when most crime here was committed by white folk.  In fact, the last, you know, Massachusetts has not, since the '40s [1940s], had the death penalty.  The last person executed in this state was a neighbor of mine who lived on the same street I lived on, a white guy named Dutchy Gertson [Edward F. "Dutchy" Gertson].  He was, he was a vet from the Second World War [World War II, WWII] and there were all us kids going around, you know, saying, "I'm Dutchy Gertson, I'll get you," you know, you play cops and robbers.  He was the last guy executed.  He was white, you know.  Crime in those days, when it was mostly whites, was done by, by poor whites, poor, you know, especially poor Irish and so forth, you know.  You lift people out of poverty, you end crime.  Crime, crime is not, is not a middle class thing, I mean except for embezzlement, but I mean violent crime.  Violent crime is something that the poor do, that they, that's their way of striking out so that for our own self-interest, we, we who have made it in the middle class, in the professional class, have got to do everything we can to make sure that as many of our brothers and sisters are lifted up out of poverty as we can.  I mean, that to me is the, is the great challenge.
Story_ID: 421347
Speaker 1: We haven't discussed your family much, you mentioned your wife a few times, but like how did you meet her and do you have children?  Now who do you consider your family right, your, at this point?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, my sister [Marilyn Carrington] died last year and there were just two of us, the two siblings.  My wife and I met two weeks after I arrived in Nigeria.  I went to my first diplomatic function, which was a party being given by the Belgium ambassador celebrating their national day and I walk into this party and, of course, you know, it's outdoors and I look across the garden and I see this vision of beauty and I say to me, I say to myself, I've got to find out who this is.  So, I ask some people around and they say, "Oh, that's Dr. Ukpoma [HistoryMaker Dr. Arese Carrington], she's a, she's a medical doctor, she does a lot of work for some of the embassies" and so forth. And so as soon as I find, as soon as I found out she was a doctor, I get on my game.  I walked over to her, I said, you know, I introduce myself and I said, you know, "I understand you're a doctor."  I said, "Maybe you can help me.  I have, since I've been here, I've been trying to find healthy, non-fat foods, you know, and I just thought, where to look, you know, maybe you could help me."  So she goes along with this and she says, "Yeah, oh sure, sure." And I give her my card and so forth and I tell her, you know, if you, you know, "Anytime you've got any ideas, you know, you just give me a call" and so forth.  I gave her my, my private number and then, and then left but I never forgot thinking about her and I said, you know, now I've got to find a way to, to really get, get to know her better.  And one night I'm in the residence and they called from the guard gate and the guard calls and says, "Mr. Ambassador, a Mr. Simmons is," he didn't say mister, he said, "There's a Simmons here to see you, someone named Simmons to see you."  I said, "I don't know any Simmons here, who--?"  I said, "Find out more about it."  The next thing I hear, someone's grabbed the phone and this gravelly voice said, "Mr. Ambassador, this is Nina Simone and I've got a, I'm angry, I need to see you right away."
Story_ID: 421027
Speaker 1: That evening I had three events to go to, it was really a busy evening. In fact, I, I had, I had my tuxedo on that evening 'cause one of the events I had to go to was a formal one. And I hear this voice, "Mr. Ambassador, this is Nina Simone, I need to see you right away."  And so, you know, I've always been a great fan, Nina Simone has always been my, my favorite singer.  In my view, the history of blues begins with, with Ma Rainey, it goes to Billie Holiday and then, then to Nina.  I mean, these, these are my, are my great, great heroes and so I, I was a great fan of Nina.  Nina comes storming in.  She had just arrived in the country, she didn't have a visa and she was insulted that they asked her for a visa because some friend of hers, I've forgotten, some other singer, had gone to Liberia, hadn't had a visa and gotten in. And luckily--because what they usually do, when a person comes in without a visa, they'll put you on the next plane and ship you right out.  Luckily, the person who was head of our Drug Enforcement Administration [DEA], a black guy, agency there in Nigeria, recognized Nina and he knew the people at the airport and he went up and talked to them and said, you know, let her in, you know, I'll vouch for her and so forth and so they kept her passport.  They said, okay, but we need to keep her passport.  And so they let her in.  So she was angry they had her passport.  She wanted her passport back.  She did, she felt uncomfortable and I was to get that passport back.  So, she's railing and going at me, you know, about all this, and here I'm thinking to myself, now, here I am, in this guarded compound, with guards outside, et cetera and I'm being held prisoner here by Nina Simone, you know, because she, she wasn't about to, to let me go.  So I finally talked and talked and finally calmed her down.  And it ended up, you know, I said, "We'll get your passport, don't worry we'll do all this" blah, blah, blah, and I said, "But I want you to do me a favor.  I want to have a reception for you here at the residence.  I want to invite, you know, various people, and I want, and I would really be in your debt if you would, if you would sing." And she agreed.  And I realized later, boy, I'm really taking the chance because Nina has a reputation, you know.  She would walk out on, you know, on concerts, et cetera et cetera, I said, you know, but anyway so, I said, okay, we, we will have this, this concert and Nina Simone.
Story_ID: 421028
Speaker 1: So I begin to get the des- the guest list up and I, there on my desk I have the card of Dr. Ukpoma [HistoryMaker Dr. Arese Carrington], and I said, okay, I guess I, I will invite her to this, and it'll give me a chance, you know, to, you know, to get to know more about her.  And so, I invite her, and a, you know, the invitations are handed out, we have a guy on motorcycle run around, you know, and the motorcycle guy arrives at her place, you know, and she's wondering what's this motorcycle person, the guy on the motorcycle doing here, you know, from the American embassy, and he hands her the, the invitation, and she's ready to go off to the beach with some of her friends and she has the invitation that says this concert for Nina Simone, and she, she didn't know who Nina Simone was, you know, what it was.  And so, she shows it to some of her friends, her friends, "Nina Simone, Nina Simone, wow, oh, can we go?" You know the whole thing.  You know, they're all very, very excited.  So she said, well, you know, maybe this is something so, so she deigns to come to the, to the concert, to the reception.  And so she comes and after the big reception, I have a smaller one for, for a small group, the foreign minister and a few other people, and I invite Dr. Ukpoma to it as well.  And Nina, it turns out, is quite a hypochondriac, and she is concerned she needs various kinds of medicines.  And so, Arese, my now wife says that, "Oh, don't worry, I can, I can help you, you know.  What are the kinds, some of the kinds of things you need?"  And so she tells her and so then Arese asks, asks her, "And how will I get them to you?"  At this point, I immediately jump in and said, "Oh, that's, that's no problem.  Why don't you just, when you get them, you bring them to me, and I will see that they get to Nina."  And so she does that and she brings them by and I invite her for dinner and so forth and so on and we get to talking and it goes on from, from there.  And so, Nina Simone was, was a catalyst in, in our getting, in our getting together.  So, I've always been in Nina's debt, but that's, that's how, that's how we met.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So we, you know, so I, I tell people that most black Americans go to Africa in search of their heritage.  I went to Africa and found my destiny, you know.  This is the way I look at it.  That was one of the great benefits of my service in Nigeria, was meeting my wife.
Story_ID: 421029
Speaker 1: What do you think today is your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, I would hope that other people who get the privilege of being an ambassador, in whatever country, would, would realize that the job of an ambassador is not just to the government, whatever government may be in power, but it's also to the people of that country, and that when you're in a situation, as I found myself in Nigeria, you really got to speak out.  You know, all my life I've always considered myself to be an activist, but an activist who was sort of, you know, part of the crowd and never really, you know, having, having a lot of power and influence and I've always said to myself, you know, what would I do if I were in a position where I had power and influence and what happens with most people, unfortunately, is that once you have that, you tend to rationalize as to why, well, maybe I shouldn't go as far as this, maybe I shouldn't do this, you know, and it's very easy and it's very, very human and I think the thing I'm happiest about, and proudest about, is that when the crunch came in Nigeria, I did not equivocate and, you know, even though, you know, I realized that some of the things I was saying and doing was undiplomatic.  Now, I must admit for me it was easier not being a career foreign service officer; it's much harder for a career person, you know, because you put your whole career on the line.  I mean, the worst thing that could happen to me, you know, they would have sent me home, so, I come home and I do other things. But I think, you know, I think that's, that's very important, not to fall into the, into the trap of, of accommodating yourself.  You know, my family sometimes wonders, thinks that sometimes I'm too much the pessimist because, you know, this old saw about the glass being half full or half empty, you know, most people think the right answer's half full.  To me, the right answer is half empty because to me the glass is always half empty because then it's a challenge to fill that glass.  You know, if it's, if you look at it as half full, then you are likely to become too complacent with, with the way things are.
Speaker 1: You take that content for granted?
Speaker 2: Right, and you know, the thing is to see the glass as half empty, and it's your duty to help to fill it.  I remember talking to a group of African students at Rutgers [Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey] a few years ago and telling them about the duty they had once they got their education to go back to their countries and to change the system and not to, and not to be bought off and, you know, I went on and on and I said, you know, and I used this metaphor of the half empty, half full glass.  I said, you know, it's important that if you see the glass as half empty, and do everything you can to fill that glass, then surely your cup will runneth over, and goodness and mercy will follow you all the days of your life.  And I, you know, I think that's, I think that's, that's very important that we, that any of us who get the opportunity to have responsibility, you know, to have a job, to have a title like ambassador or whatever, also have a duty and especially black people have a duty to go beyond what the normal parameters of, of, of the job are and, you know, and I, and I'm happy that I had the opportunity to do that in Nigeria because, you know, most people, you know, don't even have, you know, have the opportunity, you could go through, through all your life without, without really hav- having the chance to change things.  And, you know, and I think I was able to help to, to change the situation in Nigeria.
Story_ID: 421030
Speaker 1: Now is there anything I have not asked you that you think we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Boy, that's a, that's a good question.  I mean, it's hard to, you know, it's, you know, I'm sure, I'm sure once, once you leave, you know, I'll have the old, you know, what the French call l'esprit d'escalier, you know, you think of things as you leave on the steps, oh gee, I should have said that, or should have thought of that, but offhand, I can't, I can't think of anything that, you know, I think, I think we've generally covered, covered a lot.  You know, it's hard to sort of, to sort of remember everything and to, you know, to sort of--
Speaker 1: There is one thing I just thought about that keeps nagging me now and I, you know, I know we've been at this a while tonight, but I thought that--a one final person popped into my mind and that's the musician, Fela Ransome-Kuti [Fela Kuti].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yup.
Speaker 1: Fela, rather.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Ransome Fela Kuti, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and he was a political activist and a musician and a lot of things (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --and did, is there a story about, about him, Fela?
Speaker 2: Well, well, he came from a very distinguished family of activists.  His mother was a great activist.  His two brothers, one Ransome- Ransome-Kuti [Beko Ransome-Kuti], was one of the leaders of the human rights groups, the other [Olikoye Ransome-Kuti] was, was minister of health, and was a minister of health in one of the governments and an outstanding man in terms of, of being progressive on health issues.  In fact, we were there [Nigeria] when Fela died and his brother, the doctor, publicly announced that he had died of AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] and this caused all kinds of calumny on him.  I mean, people attacked the doctor for, for having said this but he said it because he wanted, he thought it was important that people knew the dangers of HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] AIDS at a time when so many people sort of sweep it under the rug, but Fela was, was a great musician and a great activist.
Story_ID: 421031
Speaker 1: And likewise, I guess, Ken Saro-Wiwa, we haven't said much about him, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Ken, Ken Saro-Wiwa was, among other things, a poet, a playwright, an environmentalist and was the leader of the Ogoni people, a group of--it's a small ethnic group of about 500,000 in a country of 170 million, but it was the group that occupied some of the, what should be some of the richest land in, in Africa, it's the land under which so much of the oil pipes run and the oil companies, especially Shell [Shell Oil Company], had sort of spoiled the area that he led the, Ken Saro-Wiwa led the fight to, to change this.  The government began to get very worried about this, and they had a trial, which was really a show trial.  It was a terrible, a terrible miscarriage of justice.  We did everything we could to, to protest.  Now we had protested in the past against other possible executions and we had won.  This time, the military around Abacha [Sani Abacha] put their foot down and said, no, absolutely we cannot compromise on this.  And I remember that I was in the plane, flying to Abuja [Nigeria] to make a last final appeal to the government.  I was to meet with the number two man in the government, General Diya [Oladipo Diya], who was a pretty good guy who, who later fell out with Abacha, and anyway, that's a whole another story. And Diya was always very accommodating, very helpful, but I arrived and found that while I was in the air, they had executed Ken and seven or eight others and as a result of that, I was recalled back to the states, as were the ambassadors from twenty-eight other countries, and I stayed back here for what, about six months, I guess, and when I, when I returned, things, I mean that was the, really the, the nastiest period in terms of relations between me and the government.  They accused me, of while I was away traveling around Europe, trying to organize other European countries to be tougher against the, against the Abacha regime, this kind of thing.  Whenever I meet with the foreign minister, he would take out pictures showing, pictures of me with, with what, with what he would call my, my followers, you know, human rights people saying that I was, you know, stirring these people up and doing all these kinds of things and so forth and they would, you know, they were trying to accuse me of all kinds of stuff.  It was, it was a tough period but one that, which I enjoyed much.  And people ask me would you go again to Nigeria, knowing would you, I said in a heartbeat.  I mean, to be in the middle of the fray and to feel you could make a difference is, you know, is a rare feeling and that's, that's what I got out of Nigeria.
Speaker 1: Now, now did Wole Soyinka win the Nobel Prize when you were there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, yeah, Wole had won the prize some years before--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but he was one of the most active of the, of the activist, of these pro-human rights.  In fact, we have a, you might show them that, the thing, a very nice tribute that he wrote for me.  No, Wole, Wole was, was very active.
Story_ID: 421032
Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, as I said, I think, you know, as one who was willing, hell, eager to use whatever little authority or position I had to try to improve the life of people around me and I think I was able to do this best in, in Nigeria because of the position I had representing the country which most people referred to as the only super power, God's own country.  You know, they had all these views of America and so being the American ambassador I could, I could exercise more throwing around of weight to than, you know, than other ambassadors might be able to do.  And so, I, you know, and I was very happy to do it.  So, you know, that's, that's what I would like to be, I think, most remembered for is, you know, as a, you know, as an activist who was, you know, was willing to get into the fray.
