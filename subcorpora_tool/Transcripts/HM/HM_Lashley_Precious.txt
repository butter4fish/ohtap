Speaker 2: No, he was born in the Clec--South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You know what town?
Speaker 2: I think it was called Batesburg, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did either--did either one of them have stories about what life was life back before slavery was end, ended, or any old stories about reconstruction, or, or anything in the South?
Speaker 2: No, they never told anything.
Speaker 1: Did you know your grandparents?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did, did.  I knew my grandfather and I knew my--on my mother's side.  My grandfather on my father's side was passed when I was old enough to realize what a grandfather was, because he lived with his son and my mother.  And the only one my mother used talk about, you know, my first sister who passed as an infant.  You know, he was active in her life.  And she used to always say, Papa Carter [maternal grandfather] did this or you know, whatever, for my first sibling.
Speaker 1: And how many, how many siblings do you have?
Speaker 2: Well, there were five of us.  I lost a brother about a year or so ago from now, who was my middle brother.  He was the psychologist.  My two brothers graduated from Howard University [Washington, D.C.], the one that passed, and then my younger brother who is an attorney.  And they're out East.  And he just called me and told me he's gon' come visit each one of his siblings this year, before he gets too, too old.  He's five years younger than I am.  He's the baby of the clan, clan.  So-

Story_ID: 71727
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you, can you remember some things about your mother.  I mean what, what did your--what, what was your other like, and, and what did she do for a living?
Speaker 2: Well, for a while, my mother used to work for the white folks.  That's what we used to say, you know, work for the white folks, doing domestic.  And then she became a silk finisher when she left the white folks.  And she wanted a better.  She had a girlfriend who was very dear to the family, a family friend, took her to work with her in the cleaners to teach her silk finishing.  And she e--that's what she became, a silk finisher.
Speaker 1: Now what is a silk finisher?  What do they actually do?
Speaker 2: Well, you only work on silk in the cleaners.  When silk shirts and silk garments come into the cleaners, then a silk finisher will finish them because, you know, just press them like you press ev--all the other fabrics.  So, all the garments go to the silk finisher to take the spots out and finish 'em.
Speaker 1: Okay, it's specialized, specialized work.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What did your father do for a living?
Speaker 2: My father worked for the railway company.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he worked for the railroad?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: And what, what did he do on the railroad?
Speaker 2: Now, to tell you truth, I don't really know.  I just know he worked for the rai--Railway Express, that's what it was.  So, he worked for the Railway Express, the L and N Railroad, which was the Louisville [Kentucky] and Nashville [Nashville] railroad, called the L and N Railway Expressway.  And that's what he was doing when he passed.
Story_ID: 71728
Speaker 1: Okay, now how did your mother and father meet?  Did they have a story about that?
Speaker 2: My mother had two brothers who my grandparents sent to Tuskegee [University, Alabama].  And one of her brothers and my father became friends, and they brought him home.  And she said, you know, he liked her and wanted to start courting her.  And she saying, well, she liked him because he was a good person.  And he didn't make no advances or demands on her before she was married.  So that's why she loved him.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's a good story.  And so they, they-
Speaker 2: Eventually got married.
Speaker 1: They got married in Birmingham [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)-
Speaker 2: In the country, which is called Pike Road, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which is like a little spit on the map, you, you know, a very small community.  And when they got married then he moved up to Birmingham [Alabama], and that's where they lived until he passed.
Story_ID: 71729
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you, can you think back about the community that you lived in in Birmingham [Alabama], about the neighborhood and the people that, the people on the street you lived?  Can you give some idea of the sights, and sounds and smells of growing up in Birmingham when you grew up?
Speaker 2: Well, I lived on the South Side of Birmingham [Alabama].  And the jail which Martin Luther King [Jr.] was in, the city jail, was on the South Side, where they put Martin Luther King in.  And the part of the South Side that I lived on was called Titusville.
Speaker 1: Okay, how do you spell that?  Do you know?
Speaker 2: Now, I can try.  I used to know, but I don't know now.  I think it's T-I-T-
Speaker 1: Well, that's okay, if you can't--you can't remember, we just-
Speaker 2: I can't remember how to spell it.
Speaker 1: All right, but it's a suburb; it's just part of Birmingham [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And Dr. [Martin Luther] King was imprisoned there in 1963, wasn't it?
Speaker 2: In the Birmingham gai--jail.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that's the neighborhood that you lived in?
Speaker 2: Right, I lived on the South Side, which the jail is--the streets in Birmingham, the part that I lived, are named for the Greek letters, Alpha, Kappa, Omega, and we lived on Delta Street.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was Delta Street like?  What, what were the houses like, and what where the people like?  Was it an all-black neighborhood?
Speaker 2: All-black neighborhood.  And when my father died, see, my father was educated, but my mother was not.  But she had terrific commonsense.  And she bought the house because she said she brought it outright from what my father left her.  In the house that we used to live in, she didn't have enough money 'cause it was a bigger house and better house.  But she didn't have enough finance to buy that house.  And she could buy 404 Delta Street outright and have some money left over.  So she bought that house for herself and her kids.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that's--were your parents still married when that--when, when she did that or--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: No, my father had passed.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: We lived in what we called the big house.  And the big house, she, she--the--she said she couldn't buy it; she didn't have enough money to buy the big house, what we used to live in, which is like 17 Colt (ph.), which was a nice house than the one she bought, bigger, and the neighborhood was bigger. But she bought the-
Speaker 1: But she-
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: 404 Delta Street, she bought that 'cause she had enough money when my father passed to buy that house.  Now I--Iris!  Call Iris, Meryl.
Speaker 2: It's okay if you can't remember something.  We, we just keep going.  But, so-
Speaker 1: But she had enough money to buy 404 Delta Street for her and her five kids.
Speaker 2: So used--she, she, she was able to buy what she could afford to until-
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --the family established itself.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: Can you remember what, what the neighborhood was like?  What were the people like?  And what, what kind of (unclear)-
Speaker 1: Well, the people were very friendly on the street.  And they just lived in common houses, you know, nothing fancy, but just nice neighborhood and nice houses.
Story_ID: 71730
Speaker 1: What kind of thing did you all do for fun when you were a, a little girl?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember what--my sister and I, we used to like to do, go downtown and look in the store windows, win--window shop.  I used to like to do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then, like on a Sunday, we had BYPU [Baptist Young People's Union].  And we used to walk all the way around the house, block from the church, you know, and walk around the blocks.  Because one thoroughfare in our neighborhood is Avenue F, was all paved, and that's where the buses ran.  So we'd loop the block on a Sunday for recreation.  After we'd leave BYPU [Baptist Young People's Union], then we'd walk around the blocks and see the sights and see the people, you know, just people watch.  But our favorite thing was going down window shopping.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what, what, kind of things would you, would you look for in the windows?
Speaker 2: One, just go to the--Burger-Phillips was a famous store in Birmingham, and Pizitz.  We used to just go and look in the window.  And I'd look in the window to get ideas about what I wanted to make, 'cause I could always sew.  And whereas I didn't always go have store bought clothes, I could make things equivalent to what I saw window shopping.
Story_ID: 71731
Speaker 1: Now, who taught you how to sew?
Speaker 2: My ma--well, actually, my mother taught me how to sew.  But then my oldest brothers, we had twev--twev-tweddle (ph.) machine, used to work the foot press.  And I couldn't get--work the foot press, so my oldest brother showed me the rhythm to how to make the machine go.  He taught me that before we had elec--an electric machine.
Speaker 1: So you had to have a--you'd, you'd have to press it in a certain way to make-
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, to get a-
Speaker 2: The rhythm, to get the rhythm to make the machine go.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so your favorite thing--you were, even as a, as a child then, looking in the windows and trying to figure out how to design clothes to wear?
Speaker 2: Right-
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --just seeing how they look.
Speaker 1: Very good, okay.  Now, is there anything else about your, your--when, when, when you were a little girl that you remember that, that, that you can share with us?  Any stories about people-
Speaker 2: Well, the only thing used-
Speaker 1: --in the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: --to have dolls and I used to make clothes for my dolls.
Story_ID: 71732
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, can you tell us about school?  What, what school did you go to in Birm-
Speaker 2: I went to [A.H.] Parker High [School, Birmingham, Alabama].
Speaker 1: Well, what, what grade school?  Let's start at grade school first.
Speaker 2: I went to [Booker T.] Washington Elementary School [Birmingham, Alabama].  That was like the neighborhood school.  Washington School was, was to the eighth grade.  And then they had--on the South Side they had Ullman, so we went to Ullman High [School Birmingham, Alabama].  It wasn't a full high school.  I think it must have been for two years, Ullman [junior high school].  And then when you left Ullman, you went to Parker, which was the big school in Birmingham [Alabama], [A.H.] Parker High [School].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when, when you went to school, did, did, did you really like school or, or-
Speaker 2: Well, I liked school, but I like handicrafts more than anything.  When I went to college, I was taught leatherwork in college too at Tuskegee [University, Alabama], so I liked, you know, like that, crafts, sort of craft things.  They taught us how to hand lace leather and how to put designs on leather.  I learned all of that at Tuskegee.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did, did you get a chance to do any of that sort of thing in grade school?
Speaker 2: No, in grade school we didn't--we just had I think cooking classes, if I can remember correct.  But we didn't have any handicraft.
Speaker 1: Okay, did, did you have any favorite teachers in grade school at all?
Speaker 2: Can't remember their names.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, when you went to the high school, what kind of activities were you involved in in high school?
Speaker 2: I wasn't involved in any activities in high school?  I got me a job.  I went to school with a boy.  Clyde Kirby and his father owned a tailoring shop, which was uptown, you know.  And he catered to white people and black people.  So, by going in--Clyde in my room, then I asked him to ask his father for a job.  And I started working for the Kirbys.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, how old were you then?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I'll say around third year of high school, around eleventh grade.  And I started working for them.
Speaker 1: So, so did you work-
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --all through high school?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't work all through high school, just, I worked just a part. Now, I did work through school, but I didn't work at the tailoring shop.  There was black people in the neighborhood who across from the elementary school had like a little variety store, Mopley's (ph.) Variety Store.  And I worked for them after school.  They sold ice cream, cookies, and candy, you know, and other miscellaneous objects.  But mainly, you know, the school children used to come across the street to the store, and they could back--get like five cookies for a penny or something; it was really reasonable.
Story_ID: 71733
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what, what was it a--did, did your family have a, a tough time making ends meet, or did you, you---
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, okay.
Speaker 2: That's my mother lived within her means.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's what--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: And--huh?
Speaker 1: I said that's wise.
Speaker 2: Right, and then one of the first things, my oldest brother got a job and went to work.  He was a--he drawled tractor trailers at a young age.  A black man used to have a company, and he hired him, quite young, to drive his tractor trailer.  And it was a big thing.  Every time my brother would be getting ready to go on a trip, he would drive the car--the truck--down to our house, you know, all loaded up, to--with the merchandise to take on the road.  And, and he used to work in produce, haul--hauling produce for this man.  And he finally got his own truck.  And he's retired so he doesn't work at all now, but he finally bought his own tractor trailer.
Speaker 1: So he had sold--so you had an enterprising family I guess.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Everybody had to do something.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so you're in high school and you're gaining a reputation as somebody who can sew and design clothes.  And-
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --did, did you--what, what did you think at that time you would do with your life?  Did you think that you would, you, you would end up designing clothes or?
Speaker 2: No, I had no idea I would even enter the business.  When I first came to Chicago [Illinois], because I wasn't good with the drawing, and I tried to enter the Metropolitan School of Art.  And I was gonna learn how to sketch, but they said, "due to the policy of our school, we do not admit Negroes."  So I never did learn how to illustrate.  And when I went to Ray College, Ray-Vogue College [of Design] in Chicago [Illinois], then my teachers told us it, it was--you don't have to be an illustrator to sketch your design ideas as long as you can sketch just flat.  And you'll understand, can get the message across what you want to present.  That's all you need.  And when you want to illustrate, then you hire an illustrator to sketch your ideas.  That's like dress your ideas up.
Story_ID: 71734
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now, when, when did you come to Chicago [Illinois], and why did you end up in Chicago?
Speaker 2: I married.  My husband was from Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I met him in Tuskegee [University, Alabama].
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so you met your husband while you were student there?
Speaker 2: No, I--when I first came to Tuskegee before I came to school there, I worked on the Air Force base.  My sister used to work at Tuskegee Air Force Base, and she got me a job.  And that's--my husband was in the Air Force, Tuskegee Air Force, and that's where I met him.
Speaker 1: So he was part of the Tuskegee Airmen, the, the, the federal program that trained black pilot and --(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: He, he-
Speaker 1: --air--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: --wasn't a pilot, but he was--worked on the base.
Speaker 1: Okay, he was part of the crew?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay, good, all right, yeah.  So, after, after I guess in--in what, in what year did you come to Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I came to Chicago in 1948.  I fin--graduated from Tuskegee [University, Alabama], I think it must have been '48' [1948] or '46' [1946].  I don't which year, but I--after I finished school, then he came down to Birmingham [Alabama] and married me.
Speaker 1: Okay, we're, we're gonna stop right here and change the tape.  It runs out every half hour.
Story_ID: 71735
Speaker 1: All right, we're, we're rolling again.  Ms. Lashley, can you tell us about Mr. Lipsey (ph.) and the radio show.  We're, we're going back now to when you were a little girl.
Speaker 2: Mr. Lipsey was a white man.  I don't know what kind of establishment he had, but he use to-
Speaker 1: Hold, hold on one second.
Speaker 2: --own black radio-
Speaker 1: Hold, hold, hold on one second.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: All right, now you were explaining who Mr. Lipsey was now--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Used to have some type of show--store.  I never went to his store.  He used to advertise for a store.  And his name was Mr. Lipsey.  The radio program played to black people, but he was a white man.  And he used to, you know, advertising for the store.  And I think it was really in what is known as West End, 'cause his--the establishment was not in our neighborhood.  But he just, you know, how you get on the radio, hawking your wares.  And everybody didn't have a radio.  We didn't have a radio.  We'd listen to the family across the street, which were the Simmons.  They were a family of girls, you know, like, they had a sister my age and then the older sisters.  But we used to all--that was the thing at four in the afternoon listen to Mr. Lipsey.  Whatever you were doing, that's what we used to do as our entertainment, listen to Mr. Lipsey.
Speaker 1: What kind of show did he have, have, meaning what kind of-
Speaker 2: Music.
Speaker 1: Did, did he play black music?  Is that what-
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now wasn't there a controversy around listening to him in the family, that you weren't supposed to or something?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother--you know, we had chores and things we had to do when we came in from school.  But in the meantime, you always listened to Mr. Lipsey and do whatever--they would turn their radio up, and we could come to the front part of the house and hear it, you know, without going out on the front porch.  So we would just, you know, do whatever we had to do around the front end of the house or the living room of the house and listen to the music.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's what we used to do.
Speaker 1: Okay, now it's been said, and I, I heard somewhere that you used to have watch out for your mother coming--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Coming in from work.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And why was this?
Speaker 2: Becau--if you didn't want to get a whuppin'-
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --for listen to Mr. Lipsey instead of doing your chores.
Speaker 1: Okay, so-
Speaker 2: Or doing something useful, whatever she might have told you to do, you know, get accomplished for today.  And she come down the street, and here you are.  And I guess we might have even, you know, came on the front porch and did (laughter), did our little dance, you know, or what have you.
Story_ID: 71736
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now there's another story about ice cream that I think is a funny story.  So can, can, can, can you tell that story?
Speaker 2: Well, my sister was the oldest.  And I don't know where she got the money from that day.  But anyway, she treated me and my two younger brothers to some ice cream.  And when we--see, we were walking home down Avenue F.  And my sister must have seen my mother on the bus riding down Avenue F, and she made us throw the ice cream in the ditch.  So that was the story when she told us throw it in the ditch.
Speaker 1: To keep your mother from seeing, huh?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Did your mother find out anyway?
Speaker 2: No, she never knew, and we never told her.
Story_ID: 71737
Speaker 1: Okay, now your mother had some favorite sayings.  Can you remember any of those?
Speaker 2: Well, her favorite saying I know was "Hard times make a monkey eat red pepper"; that was one.
Speaker 1: And what does that mean?
Speaker 2: Means hard times--if you--times gets so hard, would make, you know, a monkey eat red pepper; that means they was so hard you couldn't bear them.  You do whatever you can.
Speaker 1: You'd eat whatever you had to eat?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: All right, now what about--you have any others?
Speaker 2: Now the only thing--other thing--I remember my mother doing, she raised rabbits and chickens, so.  And, and before she [coughing]--she would never take a chicken off the yard and kill it.  If we were gonna have a chicken for Sunday dinner or a chicken this week, she used to put the chicken up.  She used to put him up off the ground, 'cause chicken scratch and (unclear), you know, eat worms and what have you.  So she never killed the chicken off the ground.  She'd put him up by the feed and feed him alum water--alum in the water.  So when she did kill him, you know, he'd been cleansed out.
Speaker 1: Okay, she made sure she had clean chickens?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when you-
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: --she was raised in the country not the city.  So that's why the idea, you never take a chicken off the yard and feed him to your family.  You put him up in, in like a pen, in this chicken pen, and let him stay for two or three days to a week and clean his system out before you would proceed to eat him.
Speaker 2: Okay, so that'll make him pure (simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --pure, kind of purify him (unclear)-
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Story_ID: 71738
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so, all right, well, let's go back to when you first arrived in Chicago [Illinois].  You, you said you got--you, you were married in Tuskegee [Alabama], and then your husband brought you to Chicago.
Speaker 2: I was married in Birmingham [Alabama].
Speaker 1: Birmingham, okay.
Speaker 2: And when I first arrived in Chicago [Illinois], then if you know how to do something, you could always find yourself a job.  And I always knew how to sew.  So I remember one of my first jobs; I worked for Mid City Uniform Cap Company.  See, this was during World War II, and they used to make caps with the bibs on, you know, the soldier caps.  So I started working for them.  And then in later years, after I outgrew Mid City Uniform Cap Company, I took the civil service exam and passed it for a [U.S. Postal Service] postal employee job.  So I worked or the postal services too.  But one thing, I worked in fan--finance.  I was a window clerk, and that's in finance.  You handled the money, the postal money, selling stamps.  So that was good.  I learned how to count money and handle money.
Story_ID: 71739
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, all the--at the same time are you, are you, are you, are you still sewing?  Are you still designing?
Speaker 2: I always sewed.  Now, I remember I used to make my clothes I wore to the post office.  And the girls--and I used to charge people for sewing.  And I remember one girl told me, well, the skirt, it's nothing but two seams.  I say okay, well, you do it yourself.  You sew it up.
Speaker 1: So what did she say?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) She told me my skirt was nothing but two seams, so I to her, well, you make it.
Speaker 1: Well, did she try it?
Speaker 2: No-
Speaker 1: I didn't-
Speaker 2: --she eventually came to me to make her a skirt, 'cause I, I had good eye coordination and color coordination, you know, and my sewing was always top class.  I never did "bamoram" (ph.) work.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How--can you explain what that, what, what, what, what that word is you just said?
Speaker 2: "Bamoram"?
Speaker 1: Un-huh?
Speaker 2: Mean when you throw it together.  Some people, like when I taught people how to sew, and like a lot of people that came to me, they would just sit down and sew and didn't press as you go.  So when you're sewing you should press as you go, so when you finish your garment and give its final press, you don't have to try to press it all over, although I had pressing--steam pressing equipment and teach you how to make your garment look store bought rather than homemade.  The "Bamoram" is homemade-
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --when you just sit down and run it up.
Speaker 1: So that--what does that word come from then?  It's a word that pe--people just came up with or what?  Did you make it up or?
Speaker 2: No, I don't know.  I guess I learned it from my mother.  But, you know, "bamoram" is homemade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it doesn't have to look homemade to be, to be homemade.  You can make it at home, but it can have a professional look to it-
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --see.  So if you learn how to press as you go, and how to trim your seams and finish it off, it doesn't make any difference where you make it; it can still look professional.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so "bamoram" is kind of like when, when people say something is "mammy made"?
Speaker 2: Un-huh.
Speaker 1: That same kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm, the same thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it doesn't make any difference 'cause you made it yourself.  It doesn't have to look mammy made.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, I understand.  So, when did you get another opportunity, I guess, to sew professionally or to make money?
Speaker 2: Well, by working for the [U.S.] post office, when I left my window clerk job, I transferred to the main post office and I was a glove wearing person, always nice and neat.  And the people in the post office, the ladies, you know, when they learned I could sew, and the things I wore looked professional, then they wanted to hire me to make things for them.  So I started making money that way.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you had your own equipment and everything at home?
Speaker 2: Yes, I had my own machines.  And I bought a buttonhole maker.  And when we didn't do bound buttonholes, we did--you know, these are work buttonholes.  But it was a professional buttonhole maker, so it doesn't look like it's "mammy made".  See, it look it came from the store.  And little things like that.
Story_ID: 71740
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was your next step after, after you were, you know, sewing for the people in the [U.S.] post office?
Speaker 2: Then I started the Lynn Stuart's Schools--School of Dressmaking.  And I used to have tables as far as the eye can see on the first floor down here for the students to come, and I taught people how to sew.
Speaker 1: Okay, now this is a--now, we, we're talking about right here in this house?
Speaker 2: In this house.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Where did you--I mean when did you acquire this house in, in--or not, not so much when, but you, but you acquired this house-
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm-
Speaker 1: --be--because of the space and everything so you could teach people how to sew--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: No, well, I didn't have--when I acquired this house, I acquired for me and my three could--children--in this--since I had this space, then I just stretched out, and I had a place for ironing and a place for stitching.  See, the way they do in the factory, you stitch--and I worked for Hart Schaffner and Marx for a time.  I was a pocket maker for them.  So, you don't just sit down--even in the big factories--sit down and make a garment up.  They do the stitching, then they do the trimming, and then it goes to the presser, see, which keeps the garment looking professional.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And since I had this space, I used to before--first I used to use the dining room back there for sewing.  So I just utilized the space that I had and put it to good use.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So people came here and took classes actually for-
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --sew, sewing classes?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Did you get your family involved in, in sewing too?
Speaker 2: Well, only one of my daughters like to sew, and that's Iris.  Iris [Ade] taught herself to sew.  She learned by watching me.  And used to--like when I'd go upstairs to bed, she'd be down--'cause I had carpet and all on the floor down here, and she'd go in the dining room.  And these were small portable machines, you know, home sewing machines that I started out with.  And she'd be in the floor on the dining room sewing when she should have been in bed.  My oldest girl [Meryl Junious] didn't like sewing, although she did learn how to make a few garments.  But she didn't really take to it.  But she did, she participated in some of my fashion shows.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so what came next?  Now, you're, you're starting to gain a reputation I guess as some who could really sew.  You're teaching people how to sew.
Speaker 2: How to sew.  And, let me thing a minute.  Then we--from the school I used have a yearly fashion show where the students participated and I participated in the fashion show.  I could showcase my designs, and the students, whatever they learned how to make under me.  In the fashion--yearly fashion show I used to have at the Parkway Ballroom [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was a yearly thing I used to do.
Story_ID: 71741
Speaker 1: Now when, when did you get really recognized by, you know, the fashion industry?
Speaker 2: Iris [calling to her daughter]--when I rented a showroom we were talking to the man that rented showrooms.  And when we rented the showroom, then he (unclear)--told us, you know, he was gon' introduce us to the market.  So, when we rented this showroom, then that mean we had purchased--it was a room no bigger than this room, 1335 I think, the Apparel Center.  That was the room, 1335.  And we met some white people from New York who had the showroom acoss--cross--us, and they were nice enough when doing market--they used to have market week.  Well, see, he was established.  I can't remember his name.  I have to ask Iris.  But when his established customers would come to his showroom, then he would walk some of 'em across to our showroom and encourage them, you know, to look at our stuff.  And they bought some of our stuff.  And then we met a buyer from New York who was a buyer for--worked for Harve Benard out of New York.  So we met his top designer, and we rented him some room in our showcase and let him show his stuff.  And then, you know, well, that's how we, we learned different things from him.  And when he went to other markets, he would include us in different markets that he was going in that we didn't know about and didn't have a showroom.  Iris--would you called Iris?  Oh, oh, they--Iris, what other market was Harve Benard in?
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE) Iris Ade:  Atlanta, Miami, New York.  Those were the markets that we participated in along with Harry from Harve Benard.
Speaker 2: And that is interesting.  This is about the only designer I heard, Harve Benard.  Yeah, I know (unclear) we interviewed [HM] Patricia Hill, and she said she only wears Har-- Harve Bernard suits.  I don't know.  So that's the person you-
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE) Iris Ade:-- Harve Bernard was a-
Speaker 2: Was a Jew and an Italian.  Harve was his Jew
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE) Iris Ade:  And Bernie.  No, Harve was the Italian.  Bernie was--is--Jewish.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE) Iris Ade:  And that became Harve Bernard.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE) Iris Ade:  And they were kind enough to give us fabric sources.  They were kind--when we couldn't find sources for linings and accessories.  And even the fact when our minimum quantities were too small, Harve would tell the mill to ship us after his order.  Harve really--and that was the way were first introduced to the better fabrics--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 71742
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause Iris was up--the upfront person.  I never worked in the upfront portion of the business, not in the showroom.  Iris worked the showroom.  She graduated from DePaul [University, Chicago, Illinois], and she had a marketing de--degree.  So she was the person that handled all the upfront building, building.  And the only time--when we went to, was that Champaign, Iris?
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE) Iris Ade:  Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, when we went to Champaign [Illinois], I won an award in Champaign.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE) Iris Ade:  That was from Robeson's [Department] Apparel Store.  It was one of our first--(unclear) (unclear) department stores in the Midwest that began to carry the Precious Collection.  And they would have an annual fundraiser.  And in the fundraising fashion show Precious Designs took first place.
Speaker 1: Okay, what I'm hearing, though, just to backtrack a little bit to the merchandising of it, is that it's not easy to get all of the essential fabrics and things that you need unless you have connections essentially.
Speaker 2: And money.
Speaker 1: And money, okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE) Iris Ade:  Revenue what is a big issue because when we began to manufacture when we were introduced to the apparel (unclear), we--our biggest challenge was being able to satisfy the minimum quantities for apparel.  And had it not been for our friends to, to tell the mills to sell us, because we stayed in basic colors, but we were always in finer fabrics.  And that was how we'd get maybe three hundred yards when you needed a minimum of a thousand initially.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so that was a great help to you, right?
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE) Iris Ade:  Very much so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE) Iris Ade:  Sourcing is a big issue and I'm sure it continues to be in the industry.
Story_ID: 71743
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so you won an award at Champaign, Illinois for, for designing and-
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE):  Precious won an award all over the city, from ha--Providence Hospital's [Chicago, Illinois] board offered her a Fashion Award.  She sold it across this corporate level.  The designs were at a time when the Apparel Center was only a year old when we entered.  And the Chicago [Illinois] market really looked to showcase Chicago designers that weren't producing collections that were standard off-the-rack, run-of-the-mill, Midwestern styles.  So we began to compete with New York and Women's Wear Daily then stepped into the market and began to recognize the Chicago designers.  And Precious Fashions made the cover of the regional Women's Wear Daily on every other season.
Speaker 1: Okay, now how did you, Ms. Lashley, how, how did you feel about all of that success?  I mean you, you--did it take you by surprise or, or-
Speaker 2: No, it didn't take me by surprise because my work was--has always been superb.  And I never did the mammy made look, and all my design work was clean.  And I did go to school for pattern making, so I learned how to make all my patterns myself.
Story_ID: 71744
Speaker 1: So you, you knew you had good work.  You just needed a break sort of?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: And once it got out, you weren't surprised at all-
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  And by meeting people from New York.  There was a girl, too, we met from New York, Iris.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE) Iris Ade:  Yes, it was.  It was a crew.  There were several people that assisted us, but what really made the difference was the work.  I believe that mama's talent is, is just that.  You're born with something, and she was born with the ability to, to create a, a magnificent, meticulous garment.  And it caught the eye of the industry, as well as the boutique fire.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I'll tell you, Teresa on Oak Street, you--she saw my stuff and loved it.  She was a big girl herself, and she had a large size, a plus size store, didn't she, Iris?
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE) Iris Ade:  Yes, we started off in Missy Ready-to-Wear, and that took off.  Eventually we extended to full-figured sizes, and the full-figured boutiques began to recognize us as well.
Speaker 2: The missy size is a little, ti--tiny sizes?
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE) Iris Ade:  No, missy size are regular women from size 8 [eight] to 16 [sixteen] or 8 [eight] to 14 [fourteen].  And then full-size--full figures are sixteen and beyond.  And we cut from full figure from size 14 to 24--no, I'm sorry--14 to 26.  And that became an issue of fit.  And that was another thing that--we had small boutique owners that had customers that were difficult to fit that would call Precious in to fit their customers for custom garments.  So she never really ever got away from that.  That happened often.  And a customers could not buy something off the rack was not uncommon to give us a call, and then mother would take her measurements and give her appropriate fit for one of our garments.  So our client really was the boutique buyer.  And when we sold the department store, it was the boutique in the department store.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 71745
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now how did you get involved with the Ebony Fashion Fair?
Speaker 2: You know, for the life of me, I don't know how I met Eunice Johnson or who told her.  But she is a connoisseur of fine nit--crafted garments.  And when I presented my garments to her--well, when you present 'em down there to her, her daughter, Linda, will meet you first.  But then, you know, she said wait.  She wanted her mother to meet me and see my work, because my, of my workmanship.  And Eunice [Johnson] don't buy "bamorams", see, 'cause she travels all over the world to the top designers.  So she does know fashion, and she also know good workmanship.  And she commissioned me to make a garment for her that was somebody's design picture she bought from Europe.  And when I made it she was just so thrilled, 'cause I made it from the picture that she had presented to me.  But it was just as if it wasn't a re-Yves St. Laurent--and I can't remember whose it was--but just as if he had done it.  And the day when they showed it were at the fashion show, and she came up and smiled and said she loved the garment.  You remember that fashion show, Iris.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE) Iris Ade:  Yes, I do.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we were sitting together.  And she was walking up to watch our seats, and she came up and commented on how much she liked the garment.  And she never quibbled over my prices.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she, so she asked you to be a, a designer for the Ebony Fashion Fair in the--was it in the '80's [1980s] or?
Speaker 2: I don't know what it was, to be truthful.  Iris can probably tell you better than I can.  I'm old now.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE) Iris Ade:  It was in the later '80's [1980s] she bought a couple of her designs--a couple of Precious Designs.  And when she needed special designs to fill the gaps in the show, then she would commission Precious to, to complete those as well.
Speaker 2: Are, are there, are there a lot of women who buy, you know, fashions from boutiques and (unclear)--or boutiques rather?
Speaker 1: Well, boutiques is a big business now, so much so the department stores have boutiques in them.
Speaker 2: To try to keep up with the trend?
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm?
Speaker 2: So for someone who's not involved in fashion at all, you know, or just barely in, in, you know, in clothes, this is a sort of a new--it's, it's a world that we don't really know that much about.  But there, there (unclear) I see there are boutiques in, in, in the community, and I, I really don't know how much--you know, I never--I can't imagine how much traffic they get or what they--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --but they, but, but there's a lot, a lot of business out here for some--someone who-
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --really designing quality clothes.
Speaker 1: Well, quality always sell.
Story_ID: 71746
Speaker 1: Now, you--now, tell us about some of the fashion shows that you've been involved in and some of the people that, that you've designed for.
Speaker 2: Well, when I--I didn't have any specific people.  I wasn't having a model.  I had one model I liked.  I designed something that she was gon' wear.  But I was never a big time fashion show giver.  Now when I presented--participated--in Robeson [Department Store], it was me along with another Chicago [Illinois] designer that they presented.  They invited us out to their house, and they had--they put us up at--'cause Robeson owned a hotel.  They put us up at a hotel, and then they had the affair at their house.  Do you remember, Iris?
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE) Iris Ade:  Yes, I do.  That was Robeson's Department Store.
Speaker 2: That little house, and I never will forget their house.  They had like a little bridge you walk across to get into their house.  And then they would sponsor the whole fashion show.  It was me and another Chicago [Illinois] designers, but I won the prize.  I got the little prize--don't, Iris, in the glass case?
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE) Iris Ade:  Yeah.
Speaker 2: --that I won first prize for, for my designs, and then have a whole big shindig for the Chicago [Illinois] designers.
Speaker 1: Can you, can you--do you have any idea of how many awards you've won for designing?
Speaker 2: I remember two: I did ra--Robeson, and the Provident Hospital Women's Association or something connected with Provident I won an award.  And--Iris, show 'em the awards.
Story_ID: 71747
Speaker 1: We do that later but, but, yeah, we'll do that later.  But, now, you also taught at the University of Illinois [at Chicago].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) that, that too, yeah.  And how did that come about?
Speaker 2: Well, there was an interracial group of women that wanted me to teach them, and one of 'em had connections with the university [of Illinois at Chicago], or her husband had connections to the university.  And that's how I got the job.
Speaker 1: So how many years did you teach?  How long did you teach?
Speaker 2: Well, I taught there.  I was teaching when I had this stroke.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE):  She taught there for a couple of years.  But in the beginning of her career she also taught sewing at Cook County correctional facility for women.  And she received that connection through Dr. [Tony] Adams at Northeastern Illinois University.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's see so, yeah, yeah, that's, that's something that, that's important, to teach vocations to people that are imprisoned to, to give them a skill.  So when they come out they can-
Speaker 2: Know how to do something.
Speaker 1: Are there a lot of jobs really available for people who know how to sew and design?
Speaker 2: Well, if you're good, or halfway good, you won't go hungry.
Speaker 1: So it's always something to fall back on.  Even if you don't become big time, you can always fall back on (unclear) to make a living.
Speaker 2: Right, 'cause I had one male I taught how to sew, and I taught him from scratch.  And you know, Michael, Iris?
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE) Iris Ade:  Yes.
Speaker 2: And Michael worked at a bridal shop, once he learned.  And I used to have him work for me too.  Then he went and started himself getting jobs.
Story_ID: 71748
Speaker 1: Now, I know the Indigo Foundation has a Precious Lashley Scholarship Fund now?
Speaker 2: Right-
Speaker 1: And-
Speaker 2: --two.
Speaker 1: Well, well, tell us about that.  Well, how do they select the students, Iris?  She can tell you more than I can about Indigo.
Speaker 2: Well, you, you, you, you tell us what you know about it, and let's, let's-
Speaker 1: Well, they contacted me, and they had also talked to Mrs. [Eunice] Johnson.  And she told them, oh, Precious Lashley?  I know her.  And she went on to explain to the Indigo Foundation, you know, how she knew me, 'cause I had worked for her.  And she spoke highly of me.  And for the past two years we have participated in the Indigo Foundation.  Two students have been awarded the Precious Lashley Scholarship of Design.
Speaker 2: Do you--well, go ahead.  What, what were you gonna say?
Speaker 1: And it's sponsored by--Absolute Liquor pays the money for the design.
Speaker 2: Okay, two-
Speaker 1: --and they-
Speaker 2: Yeah, do you think that, that a lot of young black people see design as a, as a possibility for a career, or do you, do you, do you, do you think enough of 'em see it as a, as, as a, as a way to-
Speaker 1: I don't think so.
Speaker 2: --earn a living?
Speaker 1: No, not nowadays.  I guess a lot of 'em don't even realize they can make a living at it.
Speaker 2: And so maybe it would be we may need more education in the schools or, or something to, to prepare, you know, students for, you know, ca, ca, careers in design?
Speaker 1: Or have some outlet for them.
Speaker 2: Okay, do you know of any programs where they try to teach youth at an early age to-
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --to design?
Speaker 1: Not any.
Speaker 2: Okay, so that's something that needs to be done, right?
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 71749
Speaker 1: Okay.  What, what do you see as your legacy in, in this, in the design world?
Speaker 2: And if I could do it, I guess, from Alabama, and you know, it's knowing that people from Alabama didn't have--they wasn't privileged to what white people were taught, you know.  And if I could make it from Alabama, you can make it from Chicago [Illinois], because there are many more avenues in Chicago that a student could learn from and like the neighborhood boutiques, like you have a lot of boutiques on 71st Street.  Who did we used to sell on 71st Street, Iris?
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE) Iris Ade:  Sullivan's.
Speaker 2: Sullivan's, which was a black boutique.  Then, you know, you could go 47th Street, 71st Street, 87th Street.  There's a slew of shops on each one of those streets.  You know, there's a chance that you could be goo and get your designs in the stores.  And if the students were just caught, because I remember how Joseph's Shoe Salon--I was in this salon buying shoes.  And I had on one of my designs.  And they commented on it, on the dress, and that's how I sold them.  See, so, if you, if, if you want to make it, you can make it in Chicago, whereas in Birmingham you didn't have any of that.
Speaker 1: The opportunities were--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 71750
Speaker 1: Now, there, there are so other famous designers or, or some other notable designers here in, in Chicago [Illinois], or, or--(unclear)--here in Chicago.  I, I, I can think of Scottie Piper on 47th Street.  He was a tailor who was very, very well known.  Can you think of some other people in Chicago that have made a sort of an impact on the design world and the--or do you have any friends that, that, that design that you can tell us about or the people you've run across?
Speaker 2: Do you know any, Iris?
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE) Iris Ade:  Sure, but I think they want you to talk about some, like [HM] Barbara Bates, Myra Everett--(unclear)--black women who were successful.
Speaker 2: Yeah, tell us about them.
Speaker 1: Well, [HM] Barbara Bates married a famous football player.
Speaker 2: You know which one?
Speaker 1: Who did she marry, Iris?
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE) Iris Ade:  Otis Wilson.
Speaker 1: Otis Wilson.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE) Iris Ade:  Chicago Bear.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE) Iris Ade:  She was successful before that.  She sold many of the celebrities like Scottie Pippen and Michael Jordan leathers--(unclear), remember?
Story_ID: 71751
Speaker 1: Ms. Lashley, how--what are your hopes and concerns for the black community in the future?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd like to see the black community grow and stick together, and also, when one person has the means, hire another black person or a young person and kind of help guide them in their aspirations.
Story_ID: 71752
Speaker 1: Okay, and how, how would you like to be re--remembered?
Speaker 2: I guess I hadn't really thought about that.  I'll let my daughter speak to that.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE) Iris Ade:  But I don't know how you wanna be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, how would you wanna be remembered?  You work closely with me.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) This is--well, we're interviewing you today, so how would (laughter)--so how, how would you like to be remembered?  If, if, if you hadn't thought about it that's all right, but it's-
Speaker 2: Well, I never gave it any thought, because I remember a lot of people when they first came to me to learn how to sew, and I would tell 'em, oh, you can make that your help--yourself.  And they said, can I?  And I showed 'em how you can make it yourself and make it even better, you know, when they had bought very inexpensive clothes that were not quality made.  And I went on and showed 'em, well, you can do this for yourself.  So I guess I'd like to see black people--but I guess we aren't hungry anymore, you know, like we used to be.  But try doing things for yourself-
Speaker 1: Okay, (unclear)-
Speaker 2: --and always do them well, whatever it is.  If it's worthwhile doing, it's worthwhile doing correct and very good.  Put your quality onto it.
Speaker 1: Okay, did, did your mother live to see you become a successful designer?  Did she, did, did she--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: She came to some of--I wasn't a designer then, but she came to some of Lynn Stuart's School of Dressmaking fashion shows.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you--how did she feel?  How, how did she--wa, wa, was she proud of you?
Speaker 2: Very much so.  And I also made her some very nice outfits.
Speaker 1: Tell, tell me is there something that, that we haven't asked you that, that you'd like to discuss?
Speaker 2: The only thing I, I can (unclear) in myself, I wish I was younger and I could remember more, you know, very fluently, whereas I have forgotten some of the things I used to know and I used to talk, you know, quite frequently about.
Speaker 1: Well, I think you've done a good, a good job here this evening-- (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: And I think that you'll probably be remembered as somebody who believed in quality and somebody who tried o help other people achieve the same thing.  Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: You haven't.
Speaker 2: But I'm seventy-five years now, so I wished it had happened.  But I'm glad it, it did happen.  It's happening now, even though I'm old.  Oh, show me that "Ebony," Iris.
Story_ID: 71753
Speaker 1: Well, we, we can do that later, but do you--for the future right now that you remember?
Speaker 2: Well, the one that I had when Ebony asked me to predict fashions for the future, and I (unclear), which is now big boobs is all the things and the ladies showing out boobs.  You should see that outfit in Ebony.  Do you have it, Iris?
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE) Iris Ade:  I'm sure they'll get an opportunity to film it later, but yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we'll see it in the photos--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: So, yeah, that seems like it's--that's a safe bet for the future (laughter).  That's always gonna be (laughter) popular I guess.  Okay, well, well, thank you very much.
Speaker 1: You're quite welcome.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE) Iris Ade:  Talk about the request that Eunice [Johnson] made or the sketch for future designs that you were just talking about.  That was for the year 2000, and that sketch was done maybe in the late '80's [1980s].  Do you remember what it looked like?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE) Iris Ade:  Do you remember what it looked like?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE) Iris Ade:  Describe it.
Speaker 2: It, it's a long wrap skirt.  The skirt wraps. And I think I did feather bows to cover the breast kind of exposed, and it's in color.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE) Iris Ade:  It was teal, wasn't it?
Speaker 2: Un-huh?
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE) Iris Ade:  Right.
Speaker 2: But it was--and, and the other thing I said, that men would be wearing culottes.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE):  Yeah, she did.  I forgot about that.
Speaker 2: So far men aren't wearing culottes, but the ladies have gone crazy with the big busts.
Story_ID: 71754
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE) Iris Ade:  That's true.  I remember that.  That was a great prediction for the future.  And what about the school?  I think one thing that the school never really left us.  Your students call you to this day.  Do you remember the last seminar.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE) Iris Ade:  Do you remember the fashion show, the last Haute Couture Fashion show-
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE) Iris Ade:  --where you assisted many of the ladies in completing their designs and getting their garments fit?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE) Iris Ade:  Well, you wanna talk about that a little bit, about some of the challenges when we have to actually correct the fittings?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE) Iris Ade:  You wanna talk about that?
Speaker 2: Well, the ladies from the Haute Couture always come to me to make sure that their design ideas coincide with the fabric that they have.  See, you can have a design idea and have the wrong fabric you're thinking about working it up in.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE) Iris Ade:  That's right.
Speaker 2: So they always want my approval of the fabric that they chose--choose--to make their garments.
Story_ID: 71755
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE) Iris Ade:  In addition to that, one of the best things you've always had an eye for is fit.  You wanna talk about that?  That's pra--you're as known for fitting a garment as well as designing.  You wanna talk about that a little bit?
Speaker 2: Well, I learned early how to fit myself.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE) Iris Ade:  How did you do that?
Speaker 2: Well, I used to stand up before the mirror and pin.  I had two hands then, and I could pin and fit myself.  And once you work it down over the hips, then you can take the ruler and straighten the bottom out.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE) Iris Ade:  Something you also used to do is draft all of the Precious patterns manually and then manually grade them.  Talk about that a little bit, what grading is.
Speaker 2: Grading in the business is taking it from one size to the next size but keeping the style in perspective.  Grading is a technical job, just like pattern making is technical.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE) Iris Ade:  So you wore many hats when you were manufacturing.  Where I did the marketing end of the business, you did the designing, the grading, as well as a good portion of the setup work.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE) Iris Ade:  And then ran production at--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: And what really is what taught me how to grade, I bought books on Rothschild Women's Wear Daily, which is the Rothschild end of Women's Wear Daily, who owned Women's Wear Daily.  That's--I used to subscribe to Women's Wear Daily, and I saw the books, and I bought the books.  And then I would sit down and follow the books and learn how to grade my patterns myself.  You'd be surprised.  Patterns grow in, in a minute difference in one size to the next size, but you have to keep the design lines.  You have to transfer those over too.  So if you do one design, you want to do it in a six and then in a twelve, that's where the grading is, to take it from a six to a twelve and keep the design idea from the six to--so it will show up in the twelve but-
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE) Iris Ade:  (Simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: --has to fit.
Speaker 1: --to a size 26.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE) Iris Ade:  You also had a good eye for fine fabrics.  That's the one thing I remember as a child.  Talk about some of the fabrics that we've worked in, the actual fabric themselves.  That was always very impressive to me.
Speaker 2: Well, (unclear) all fine fabrics, chiffon to silk velvet.  And I did a silk velvet dress for Eunice Johnson.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE) Iris Ade:  That was for Ebony Fashion Fair.  But we also worked in Australian wool, French wool, Italian silks.  Do you remember what else?
Speaker 2: And I remember the time when Iris bought these Italian wool.  And I sent her--when they finally came in, I sent her to the airport to pick 'em up and it took all day.  She had to go through customs.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE) Iris Ade:  I remember that experience.  I remember when we first thought we were importing from dusty silk.  That was dusty silk, and I didn't realize that after we paid for the fabric--remember that?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE) Iris Ade:  We-
Speaker 2: Got a play--pay--customs the freight and the handlin'.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE):  Right, almost cost as much as the fabric.
Speaker 2: But that just--the wool made the cover of Women's Wear Daily.
Story_ID: 71756
Speaker 1: --can't remember what year.
