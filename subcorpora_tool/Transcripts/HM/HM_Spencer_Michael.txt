Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today with The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, could you please give us your full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: It's Michael Gregg Spencer, M-I-C-H-A-E-L, G-R-E-G-G, S-P-E-N-C-E-R.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there a story behind your middle name?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there is, see if I can remember.  I think Gregg was, it was a, something to do with my mother and I've forgotten.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Okay, well maybe you can think of it as we go along.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: All right, and sir what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: March 9th, 1952, Detroit, Michigan but a little bit strange in Detroit.  As you know it's Wayne County so it's not exactly the city of Detroit but it's less confusing if you say Detroit.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were born in another part of Wayne County than--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was just--well as I'm given to understand Wayne--the county line in the City of Detroit at that time had some differences so I think I was born in Wayne County but my family was living in Detroit so I think Detroit is probably the shorthand.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And sir, what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: I'm a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Cornell University [Ithaca, New York].
Speaker 1: And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is August 5th, 2012.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: This is my house, 126 Park Lane, Ithaca, New York.
Story_ID: 91507
Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions that we always ask as a warm up and they only require a short answer.  The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: I don't I have a great favorite, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Yes, blue.
Speaker 1: All right, a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I have a couple of favorite destinations but I'm not so big on vacations.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: These are tough questions.  No I don't think so.
Story_ID: 91508
Speaker 1: Well, I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side and separately so we can keep them straight and then we'll put them together.
Speaker 2: Right. Sure.
Speaker 1: So can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Laura, L-A-U-R-A Lee, L-E-E Spencer, S-P-E-N-C-E-R.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I have to figure this out.  I could get you the exact date but, if that's important, but I can give you an approximation.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's fine.
Speaker 2: See, she was about eighty-five when she died in 2003.  I remember correctly so that would be 19, 1919, is that right?  1919.
Speaker 1: About 1919.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 1919, doing the math right.
Speaker 1: Right.  And where was she born?
Speaker 2: Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them and what were they doing, any stories from that side?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's quite a, quite an interesting story.  My mother's family heritage goes back to a person who served in the Revolutionary War, Richard Wall who married a free black woman, Amelia.
Speaker 1: So his name was Richard--
Speaker 2: Wall.
Speaker 1: --Wall, W-A-L-L?
Speaker 2: W-A-L-L.
Speaker 1: And now I take it he was not black?
Speaker 2: No.  Richard Wall was, Richard Wall's family was Irish and somehow they, that family was subject to religious persecution and he found himself in France where he enlisted with John Paul Jones [Scottish sailor and naval fighter in the American Revolution] and served with him on the [USS] Bonhomme Richard and was captured, held as an English prisoner and later swapped and returned, and settled in Charleston, South Carolina after marrying Amelia.
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how they met, I mean, or where they met?
Speaker 2: No, there's very little known.  There's a fair amount, kind of a great deal known about him through a biography and he petitioned the Congress of the United States for his Revolutionary War pension so my mother has the documents of that petition.  Thought at one time she might even join the Daughters of the American Revolution as a whim.  So there's a fair amount known about him but almost nothing about her.
Speaker 1: And what was her name again?
Speaker 2: Amelia.
Speaker 1: Amelia, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So there's no last name?
Speaker 2: No, not--no pre-marriage name.
Speaker 1: Amelia.  And so you're not, are you sure where she or do you have any idea where she was from?
Speaker 2: Just speculation but they, but we do know she--they had an actual marriage you know actual, legal marriage.  I think my mother was able to document that much and able to document the family tree back to Richard pretty well which includes a black alderman also by the name of Wall who sponsored some early civil rights legislation.  And I have a lot of the papers from them, her papers.  They had formed the Free Black Society in Charleston.  They were all free blacks.  As you know Charleston had both free and slave blacks during that time and their particular group was called the Brown Fellowship and one of my in-laws was the secretary of that.  And unfortunately we don't have the notes of the meeting but we do have some of the commissions and if you like I can show you some of those documents, commissions and deeds of burial property.  And during the Civil War, Wall before he became an alderman was a tailor so we have some passes which allowed him to cross the battle lines you know when he would do, be on business of tailoring or something like that.  So--
Speaker 1: So he was a--it was called the, it was a Free Black Society in Charleston or--?
Speaker 2: Yeah there were a couple.  Well this one was called the Brown Fellowship and what they did was they banded together to do a couple of things as a group.  One of them was to buy burial plots, so they would buy burial plots.
Story_ID: 91509
Speaker 1: Now this is important because free black people in cities in those days whether north or south had very few actual rights and, because they weren't really citizens.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So they were really trying to I guess narrow down you know what they could and could not, what they were and were not entitled to do in that city.  I guess they were trying to carve out a place.
Speaker 2: So I don't know whether you studied this.  I know you're a historian but it has been a subject of some study.  In Charleston [South Carolina] the free blacks initially had a lot of rights and as you know the Denmark Vesey uprising or plot and Vesey was a free black you know that, he was discovered.  And as a result of that there were many laws passed that restricted the movement of free blacks.  So there was a--to answer your question or to address your question, that was not a constant.  You know those rights came and went.  And so before the Vesey revolt there was a significant number of, significant latitude of movement in Charleston.  After the Vesey Revolt there was a lot of backlash.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Vesey's Revolt was in 1822 and, just for the record, and yeah, that's you know after the Nat Turner revolt there was a clamp down too on--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --free blacks north and south.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: They were all suspected of--
Speaker 2: Right.  But the Vesey one was particularly significant because it happened in Charleston.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So that was one of the big fears of the slave owners if we free black people what will they want to do?  Free other black people.
Speaker 2: Yeah, no that was--yeah I think the Vesey and the certainly the Nat Turner rebellion and the Vesey almost rebellion scared the living dickens out of the people in Charleston.
Speaker 1: It was a huge plot from what I understand with guns stashed and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --highly organized and it was just a day from actually you know taking place, you know--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Absolutely correct.
Story_ID: 91510
Speaker 1: So, I mean, Charleston was an extremely interesting place and as you may or may not know some blacks actually had slaves themselves.  So Charleston was New York and would have been New York had not the civil war occurred.  It was New York because it had a warm water port and if you ever go to Charleston you see a city that's just arrested in time.  And because of that it was informed by a great deal of culture and knowledge as all seaports do and so you know most of the first churches in this country, the first churches were in Charleston.  And it has a rich history among African Americans too you know in terms of the African American church.
Speaker 2: The first black Baptist Church.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Allen right, Richard Allen [African American educator, writer and minister, founder of the African Methodist Episcopal Church] it was--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Sorry I'm confusing them but there was a, yes the first American (unclear).
Speaker 2: I think the first black Baptist congregation was in Charleston.
Speaker 1: Correct, yeah.
Speaker 2: That was, that preceded Richard Allen.
Speaker 1: Yes, absolutely.
Speaker 2: And so that's--
Speaker 1: I can't call the name but it did precede and there was a lot of history there.  Plus, in Charleston they had their own schools, private schools for the--the free blacks had their own private schools.
Speaker 2: Now correct me if I'm wrong or if there's something else different in your family.  But a lot of, from what I understand the free black population actually was related to the white slave owner population, a lot of them were related to them and that's how you got the slave ownership and the other things, you know.
Speaker 1: I don't know about that.  In--certainly not true in my family's case on my mother's side.  True on my father's side but yeah, can't speak to that.  I wouldn't argue against it.
Speaker 2: I mean it's not 100 percent true 'cause you know Denmark Vesey was not you know related to any white people at all but--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So I mean you know my mother's mother and--my mother's mother was related, was also mixed but in that case it was Scottish and it was McLeish. But it wasn't, to our knowledge it wasn't any--well we don't know.  We don't know the slave owner piece of it on our mother's side.  I mean it could have been.  In the case of Wall it wasn't, he was not a slave owner.  But maybe the McLeish was a slave owner.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  So this is a long, your mother's got a long history on this side and mostly in Charleston, South Carolina?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Now, and the ancestor that became the alderman right after the civil war did he serve as an alderman in Charleston or--?
Speaker 1: Charleston.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So is this a result of the Freedman's Bureau and that sort of thing, the new--him being able to be an alderman, an elected official--?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Whether it was, I don't think it was the Freedman's Bureau but it was you know after the Civil War you know, the--
Speaker 2: Reconstruction and--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --reformation of the governments down there and that sort--
Speaker 1: I believe so.  Don't know the details but I, I would suspect so and certainly around that time.
Story_ID: 91511
Speaker 1: Okay. Any other stories from that side [mother's side]?  Is there a story how the family got to D.C.?
Speaker 2: No, not really.  I mean that's, a lot of--I mean it's, in the--there's quite a story about Richard and his brother Gilbert and all of those kind of things.  It turned out to be, come from the records of the U.S. archives, there's quite a bit of documentation there.
Speaker 1: About Richard Wall and his--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Richard and you know his brother Gilbert was in the Marines and you know the petitioning for the--you know in that time after the war you, the people who served on the boats got a share of the booty that the boats captured.  So you know as part of the documentation he would petition for all of the booty that was--that John Paul Jones' ship had gotten, his share during the war, that was a part of the compensation. So--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when a ship even, I mean from what I understand the U.S. had a, you know it's kind of a--in the Revolutionary War there wasn't a really actual navy or something it was more like a merchant ships and guys that wanted to help the cause attack the British you know to see what they could get out of them.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but of course John Paul Jones had an actual ship, war ship.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I'm trying to remember if it was commissioned or what, you know then--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was.  I believe so.  There was another one, I think he got on another one too.  I'm getting a little murky here but I think there was another ship.  The United States during the war had about all of two or three ships and one of them was run by John Paul Jones and then I think there was another.  It was only a couple, but these were war ships.  They weren't just, they weren't merchant ships, they were actual you know war ships, as I understand.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Probably, most of them were what you're referring to.  I mean the numbers have got to be small.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you referred to the [USS] Bonhomme Richard--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --was the ship he you know fitted out in Scotland [United Kingdom] or something first, 'cause somebody's in Great Britain [United Kingdom] and then he went to France and then he came back across.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and that's where Wall joined in France.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So now is there any story from this side of the family about Emancipation or how people felt about Emancipation when it came or--?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I always say that's surprising cause there are very few people that know as much about their family history as you but even at that there's very few stories of the ones we have about actual Emancipation Day you know.  It would seem like it would be a big deal back in those days but nobody has a story that's passed down about it probably.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, okay.
Speaker 2: Well you know these were--
Speaker 1: They were free anyway, so called free--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were free.
Speaker 1: --in South Carolina but--Charleston.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now they make them really free but they were like free colored people in Charleston which is--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know.
Story_ID: 91512
Speaker 1: So your mother [Laura Lee Spencer] was born and raised in [Washington] D.C.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And I asked before was there a story how the family got to D.C. or why they went to D.C., but--
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know why.
Speaker 1: But were her parents born in D.C. too or--?
Speaker 2: No, my mother's mother was from Charleston [South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what's your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: Good question.  Lou.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's what I remember but I have to, I mean her last name is Lee.  My mother's maiden name was Lee.  Think it--somehow I think it is Lou Lee.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that's probably wrong.  Charleston people are very proper and they probably--so if my relatives ever see this they'll kill me for not, for getting these things wrong.
Speaker 1: So it could be Louise or Luella or probably--
Speaker 2: Louise rings a bell, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah?
Speaker 2: We could find out.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what did she do?  Did she--for a living?
Speaker 2: She was a housewife.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what about your grandfather?
Speaker 2: Don't know his first name but I do know what he did.  My mother was very fond of him.  He was a, he had a very big job.  He was a postal clerk on the railroad sorting mail.
Speaker 1: Okay.  He was a railroad postal clerk, all right.  Now what side of D.C. did your mother grow up on?
Speaker 2: Northeast, Gerard Street.
Speaker 1: And what did she say about growing up?  What was it like when she came along?
Speaker 2: Well she said that her mother shielded her from segregation as much as possible.  And that there was a great effort to only go to the few places that admitted blacks so the one ice cream parlor, etc.  And if any attempt was made to try to go to one that didn't there would be some excuse given so that her mother tried to, for as long as possible, keep her from ever being exposed to racism.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In segregated Washington [D.C.].
Speaker 1: So with her father having the kind of job he had were they considered like middle class people like--?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Story_ID: 91513
Speaker 1: What, what high school did she [Laura Lee Spencer] attend?
Speaker 2: She went to Dunbar High School [Washington, D.C.].  Do you know anything about Dunbar?
Speaker 1: Well it's a, I know it's a source of pride for people who have gone to Dunbar High School.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  She was the valedictorian of her class.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Dunbar High School was a very special place because if you were an educated black person at a high degree of education, you tried to get a job at Howard University and if you couldn't you went to Dunbar. So Dunbar had a faculty that was truly outstanding.
Speaker 1: Hmm, so the faculty rivaled the faculty at Howard?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Although these were the days and we've heard lots of stories about black people who get Ph.D.s but teach on a high school level because there's no place else for them to go?
Speaker 2: That's absolutely correct and that's--that happened with my mother's teacher.  She was--and of course that's the interesting part about segregation.  That was, that worked out really well for her but it was a tragedy for you know, for the teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay. So where did your mother go on to college?
Speaker 2: She was one of the first black women to go to Mount Holyoke [College, South Hadley, Massachusetts].  And she got there in part by these great teachers who would tutor her and prepare her for the college entrance exams.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now what did she pursue at Mount Holyoke?
Speaker 2: She majored in sociology.  She did an honor's thesis.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And now did she go on to get a masters degree or Ph.D. or--?
Speaker 2: No.  No money for that.  She did go, she got a degree in social work for the New York City School of Social Work [New York, New York], but I think her money ran out after that.  Later, much later she would go back to school at night and get a law degree.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Pregnant with me at the time.
Speaker 1: I take it that she probably was the, one of the--well she, when she was at Mount Holyoke, was she the only black student?
Speaker 2: She was one of two I believe and perhaps the third in the history of the school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so I would take it in a lot of situations she would be the only one--?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Story_ID: 91514
Speaker 1: I'm going to go to your father's side and then we'll try to put them together.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Thomas Spencer, don't know his middle name.  I think it was--I don't know his middle name right now.  Thomas Spencer.
Speaker 1: Okay and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Don't know the exact date.  His place of birth was Frankfort, Kentucky.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was he older than your mother?
Speaker 2: He was older than my mother. He died rather young.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You say, about how old, much older do you think he was?  If she was born in 1919, what would you suspect?
Speaker 2: He was about six or seven years older I would say.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you mean 1911, 1912?
Speaker 2: Yeah, can probably find that out.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what can you tell us about your father's side of the family?  Frankfort, Kentucky does it--do their roots go to some other place other than Kentucky?
Speaker 2: Yeah, actually I know a great deal about my father's side of the family.
Story_ID: 91515
Speaker 1: We were getting ready to talk about your father's side of the family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How far back can you trace them and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: So, go back to great-grandfather, Benjamin Spencer and my uncle, my godfather John Spencer was a, what you might call a natural griot [West African historian or storyteller].  He just told stories over and over again.  So I know the story.  And the story goes like this.  Ben Spencer was born on the slave plantation and he was about the age of the master's son who was being tutored.  And this was in Kentucky, can't remember the county right now but I can find out.  And it was a Spencer plantation obviously.  The boy was not taking to learning very well so they thought that the company of my great grandfather would help the process so he had the opportunity to get an education by sitting in on the classes of the slave master's son.  And, well, he took to that like a duck to water and he learned how to read and he read literally everything he could get his hands on.  And apparently in those days it was possible to acquire your freedom by some sort of an agreement and so you could purchase it or somehow acquire it.  So when he grew up to be a young man he acquired his freedom by a means I'm not exactly sure and he went north, think he was in Harland County.  He went north to Frankfort [Kentucky] and there he sat in on an exam to be a teacher and somehow he was allowed to take this exam and, probably they thought it was a joke or something, and he passed this exam and he received his teaching certificate.  And we believe that it's the first teaching certificate given in a slave holding state and I have a copy on the table there.  And the original has been given to the University of Kentucky [Lexington, Kentucky].
Story_ID: 91516
Speaker 1: But he [paternal great-grandfather Benjamin Spencer] didn't find teaching a very profitable enterprise.  He taught for a little bit and one day he came upon a shoe store and there was an old German shoemaker.  And he went inside and he said, "Well, how much do you get for a pair of these shoes?" And the man told him.  And he was intrigued by that and he apprenticed himself to this German shoemaker and learned the shoemaking trade.  And after he learned the shoemaking trade he started his own shoe shop and I have a picture of that.  And that shoe shop stayed in continuous existence for a hundred years.  Now there are many stories I could tell you but one of the more interesting ones is that the--he became a, kind of a fairly well to do person, perhaps more about that later if you're interested.  But during the time that he was running this shoe shop, the Buffalo Soldiers came through and the officers of course wanted to be billeted as would suit their rank in the town as they're passing through.  And Ben arranged for that to happen and them to be treated with all the courtesies that are due officers.  And when they left as a show of gratitude, they arranged a government contract for him.  So he would receive a train load of Calvary boots that needed repair in the railway station and he would repair these boots, put them back onto the train as part of the fulfillment of this government contract.
Story_ID: 91517
Speaker 1: So he [paternal great-grandfather Benjamin Spencer] became a fairly well to do man and actually bought stock in the Stock Exchange through and with a white druggist and of course it was 1930.  So what can--there's more, much more to this story but let me stop.  I have many stories to tell but let me stop there.
Speaker 2: So he, well that last reference was 1930.  This was not--the stock market crashed in '29 [1929] so did he lose his stock?
Speaker 1: He lost.  The stocks were bought before the crash, quite a number of them.  He lost the stocks and my godfather tells me that the whole chest of stocks was worth about a thousand dollars but you could imagine how much they were worth before the market crashed.  The white druggist committed suicide, bit more to that story.
Speaker 2: Well what's the rest of it?  Now tell the rest, may as well tell the rest of it now.  Sounds like it's good.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the story goes like this.  Ben was making a lot of money for his time and as a black man.  And he was an educated man and he loved education and he-- Did I do something wrong? I don't think so.
Speaker 2: He loved education.  Every Sunday he would go to the historically black college and he'd talk.  He wanted to be an astronomer and he would talk science with the professors up there.  Well anyway he was an educated man and he took to investing his money in stocks and his wife, name was Sue, could not read you know and she said, "Ben you know you don't know those people in New York.  Why are you putting your money up there?"  And she took her money and she bought land for the children.  She said, "Now I know Mr. So-and-So down the road, he's an honest man and I'm going to buy this land."  And he couldn't explain to her about stocks obviously.  But you know he, "You know you don't understand," so forth.  Well as it turned out she was right.  He, the stocks that he bought crashed and the druggist who he was in--partners with committed suicide.  And so my godfather who was a young boy then you know goes up to him and he says "Well, I just heard that so-and-so has just committed suicide" and the old man turned to him.  He said, "Son, it's bad but it's not that bad."  And that messaged stayed with him for the rest of his life.  And the other thing that was fascinating was when these stocks were liquidated as I said they were worth about a thousand dollars and my uncle when he came to my graduation at, in Ithaca [New York] said that when he first got into Ithaca he felt like he wanted to bomb the place because one of the stocks in Old Ben's drawer was Ithaca Gas and Electric.  He had bought stock in the '20s [1920s].  So that's the story.
Speaker 1: Okay, well so that's worth telling.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That was worth telling.
Speaker 2: It's a good story.
Speaker 1: So yeah, so that is a very interesting story and you know it probably has--there are a lot of connections in it probably we don't--Buffalo Soldiers at the turn of the century, Colonel Charles Young out of Xenia [Ohio] at one time was in charge of the 10th Calvary going through the Tetons and then taking them into Central America and other places.  I mean there's a lot of, probably a lot of (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah I don't know, it would be interesting to see if that story was true.  It's been passed down.  I don't know, it is certainly true that he was fixing, that he had a government contract so it had to come from somewhere.  So sounds--seems like it should be true.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So this was your great grandfather, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 91518
Speaker 1: So what about your [paternal] grandfather?  What--?
Speaker 2: Well, less about him.  I think the great-grandfather [Benjamin Spencer] was the dominant figure, don't know so much about him.  You know he--my father [Thomas Spencer] and my godfather, brothers of course, their mother died in childbirth and so grandfather married again and my godfather didn't have so much for the stepmother.  And so he decided what he was going to do was he was going to go down the street and live with Ben and Sue [Spender's great-grandparents] and he did and so he basically went down there.  My father stayed with the stepmother.  So since I'm getting the stories mostly from my godfather I get the stories of, about Ben, and I also get the stories about Sue's sisters and these are all slavery stories and they're really interesting.
Speaker 1: So this is your great-grandmother, Sue, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you know her maiden name at all?
Speaker 2: No, she was born on a slave plantation.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she may--didn't have one probably.  Okay, Sue Spencer, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, we'll go ahead.  More stories.
Speaker 2: So do you, more stories or you want to--?
Speaker 1: Yeah, go ahead if you have some.
Speaker 2: Oh I got some more.  Oh I told you my uncle was an actual griot [West African historian or storyteller].  So I tell you a story about, which is one of my favorite stories, about Black Uncle Zack.  As a matter of fact if I ever get a moment I've got to write these stories down and try to do some justice to them.  So Sue, and I have her picture, is very fair skinned and her mother was a kept woman and by that I mean that she was the mistress of this, unmarried mistress of the slave master and she was kept apart from the rest of the slaves on their plantation.  Not the Spencer plantation but their plantation.  So obviously my great-grandmother is strongly mixed as we talked about earlier with this--I know it from the father's side not the mother's side--strongly mixed and this woman wanted dearly to have a child by a black man, okay.  And when a stage coach driver came through she saw her chance and so she did have a child by a black man and his name was Zack and the sisters loved him and they called Black Uncle Zack.  So as you can imagine--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did they actually get together and get married or did they--or was it a, just a--?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: She's on the slave plantation, this guy comes through--
Speaker 1: Just coming through, okay.
Speaker 2: --you know driving the coach and she has a chance to have a relationship with him, wanted to have a black baby.
Story_ID: 91519
Speaker 1: Zack [Spencer's great-uncle], you know this is fast forward now years later, Zack becomes a horse trainer and he is a bit of a wild liver.  And you can imagine my great-grandfather is a very dignified, educated man, pillar of the community, can't--doesn't have any time for that, but the sisters love him.  So every time horse racing season is over, he would come with a wad of money and he would stay until he spent all his money on drinking and whatnot.  And my uncle, his job was--would be to you know sort of wait on him and he, the man would bang on the floor and say, "Bring me up some water."  Well my uncle didn't have much patience with all that as a young man, young boy.  You know he would call for water, getting his whistle wet and he was just under his breath you know just, "Why don't you just give him all his money and let him spend it all so he can just go."  But the sisters would have none of it, they just loved him.  And so he would spend his time there and he'd--ultimately he'd come, spend his money and leave and go back, but that was the story.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  So now this is during slavery.  Now is there a story on this side about the end of slavery?
Speaker 1: (Shaking head no.)
Speaker 2: Nobody really discusses that?
Speaker 1: Didn't seem such a--many other stories about you know on the same plantation with the kept woman, his brother crossed the fence, was an abolitionist.  And if his, if a slave escaped to the other side, his brother wouldn't return it to his brother.  So they became enemies and the slave holder said, "If I catch you doing something or other, I'll kill you." And he did, killed his brother.
Speaker 2: Talk about a nation divided I guess.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  That caused a great deal of concern for my uncle when he was told that story because that would mean of course that he had the blood of a murderer inside of him.  But the old women made that notion all right.  They just dismissed it.  They said that blood don't count and that was that.  That blood don't count.
Speaker 2: So it was--the story you tell about your great-grandmother Sue Spencer is also about a certain amount of disdain for the white blood that they had?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That was--
Speaker 1: Well I mean the guy's a murderer and an awful person.  He's keeping a woman in isolation.  That's an awful person.
Speaker 2: So this explains why your great-grandmother wanted to have a baby by a black man?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would think.  Makes sense to me anyway.
Story_ID: 91520
Speaker 1: What did your father [Thomas Spencer] say about growing up in Frankfort [Kentucky]?
Speaker 2: Well I think he liked it.  He had a great time.  He talks a lot about a great-granddad.  He was a, he had a--he was a, he and my father are a bit of an extrovert and they would you know, they had a singing group, Spencer's Deep Rhythm Band.
Speaker 1: It was called Spencer's Deep--
Speaker 2: Deep Rhythm Band or something like that, and of course the old man was a, was fairly well known in the community.  So if the boys were in the wrong place, he would threaten the owners, you know, and make sure that they kicked them out of there, in the pool halls and the other things.  But he liked it.
Speaker 1: Spencer's Deep Rhythm Band, did they make any records or--?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Did they tour or anything or--?
Speaker 2: No, but my father wrote music which I have and got it copyrighted.  He had a good singing voice, so did my uncle.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they had people playing instruments too?  There was a band actually right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, well what was their style of music?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  He only told me about that once.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So now did your father have a chance to go to school too and--?
Speaker 2: My father was put--was sent to school but he had a--he went for one year and he had a relationship and a pregnancy which cut his university career short.
Speaker 1: Now where did he go?
Speaker 2: Don't know where he went to school, probably Kentucky State [University, Frankfurt, Kentucky] which was the black school, but only for a year.
Story_ID: 91521
Speaker 1: Kentucky State [University, Frankfurt, Kentucky], all right, so, but he [Thomas Spencer] only went for a year.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: So what did he do for a living, what did he do?
Speaker 2: So he was a very interesting guy who I'm sorry I never got to know.  So I told you my mother was the valedictorian of her class.  For many years and for many--for most of my life I thought that she was the intellectual.  I was wrong, he was.  Now what he did was he was a beer salesman, but what I didn't know was apparently he was also very active in the Communist Party, not the Communist Party, Socialist Party.  And he's--now that I--once my mother died, I see the range of the books that he had.  It was really quite astounding, he's extremely well read.  My father was also an inventor and he has, he holds a U.S. patent on a hot comb for straightening women's hair.  He wrote songs, he invented board games like--board games before they became popular, board--and he was quite the extrovert.
Speaker 1: Hmm, okay.  Now so, did he have a--now his daytime gig was as a beer salesman then, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, and what brand did he sell then?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: Blatz Black Label.
Speaker 1: Oh, Carling Black Label you mean?  Yeah--
Speaker 2: I think it was Blatz beer though.  It was Blatz--
Speaker 1: There's Blatz beer, there's Blatz and Carling Black Label they're two different--
Speaker 2: It's Blatz.
Speaker 1: But Blatz.
Speaker 2: Blatz.
Speaker 1: Okay, Blatz.
Speaker 2: I remember Blatz.
Speaker 1: Yeah, draft brew Blatz beer.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And he had this promotion where he would go to the bars and he would, well there's a videotape.  He would make movies of the bar patrons and that would help him sell his, he was quite--help him sell cause he would come back and show these movies.
Speaker 1: This is interesting.  Clarence Mitchell's family did that back in the turn of the century.  His grandfather would go into a town, secretly shoot the people and then invite them to a showing and show themselves on screen.  Then they would do like, they would sell them medicine oil and other--
Speaker 2: I guess it was a takeoff although I don't--he, I guess you know he never--he did it on his own and I'm sure he never knew the Mitchells.  Mitchell sound like a Baltimore [Maryland] family.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right that's the one.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Those are the very Mitchells, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So he didn't--but he, I don't think he knew them, any of those, but he did that.
Story_ID: 91522
Speaker 1: Now, now what's this story about how your parents met now?  They come from two different areas and end up in Detroit [Michigan] where you're born.  And so--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --what's the story?
Speaker 2: So the story is that my mother was working for the war labor board and during the War [World War II] you know we had a controlled economy, prices were fixed by the government and wages were fixed by the government because of the war time economy.  And she was part of that infrastructure and of course Detroit was the arsenal of democracy.  It was where all of the autos were being, you know tanks and so forth.  So as part of her job she had to go to the, to Detroit and it was during that time when she was in Detroit that she met my father.  And I actually now have a copy of all the letters that he sent back and forth, you know, romantic and so forth as he wooed her you know from that first meeting.
Speaker 1: Now what was he doing in Detroit?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure, not exactly sure.  I think he was selling beer or something.
Speaker 1: Okay, cause you know we got him in Frankfort [Kentucky] so he was--
Speaker 2: No, in Detroit is when he was selling beer.  So he--
Speaker 1: Okay, so he started, he had already--
Speaker 2: --had, he had gone from Frankfort to Detroit.  You know Detroit was a place where a lot of people from Kentucky migrated to as part of that migration trail.  You know and Detroit was an extremely lively city during those days and, my uncle, I got more stories about Detroit from my uncle.  But so both he and, both the brothers, all the brothers as a matter of fact there were three or four brothers, they moved from Kentucky to Detroit because of the opportunities, so all the brothers were in Detroit.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's when he met my mother and--
Speaker 1: So what year did they meet, do you think it was?
Speaker 2: It would have to be in the--during the War.  So what were the years of the War?
Speaker 1: '41 [1941] to '45 [1945], '46 [1946].
Speaker 2: Probably around '41 [1941], yeah something like--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now your father would have been, no he would have been you know draft age I guess but he would have been in his thirties then right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, I think he had some physical issues.  He was a little older.  My uncle was younger and actually went into the Army.  And his son from this marriage, first marriage that never happened also went into the Army.
Story_ID: 91523
Speaker 1: So your parents met and they got--did they get married towards the, before the War [World War II] was over or right after war or--?
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  I think they got married after the War was over.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you think like 1946 or so--?
Speaker 2: I think that sounds about right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now--and they lived in Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.  So your mother [Laura Lee Spencer] just, she was--after the War she was able to stay in Detroit and just, and did she pursue a career in Detroit or did she--?
Speaker 2: Right, she went to, she worked first for the Detroit Health Department and then later on as I told you she studied law at night and became one of the first black women lawyers in Detroit.  She's a contemporary of you know who I'm trying to think of, senior senator--senior congressman from Detroit who does the jazz things, Conyers.
Speaker 1: Yeah, John Conyers.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she's a contemporary of John Conyers.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now--
Speaker 2: Or was.
Speaker 1: What, she go to law school in Wayne State [University, Detroit, Michigan] or--?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And she finished when, around the time when you were born right then?
Speaker 2: There was a bet whether I would be born before she finished or whether afterwards.  She was in later stages.
Speaker 1: So did she win the bet or--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she finished before I was born, I think as I recall.
Speaker 1: All right.  (Unclear) so she's finished in 1952.
Story_ID: 91524
Speaker 1: When you consider your parents' personalities, their dispositions, their habits, hobbies, how they walk, talk, looked, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Split, although I didn't know it.  My father was a total extravert and extremely inventive.  My mother was quiet but a real scholar in the traditional sense.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --a split personality.  Very much--
Speaker 1: All right, so you got the scholarship and the--?
Speaker 2: From time to time, yeah.
Speaker 1: And you said earlier now he was the intellectual of the family.
Speaker 2: He was a real intellectual.  Intellectual in the sense that he you know was--tried to absorb so much.  I mean he was--he would drink--he was reading Meinkoff (ph.) and you know the Lenin and Marx and all of the literature of the day.  He has books and books and books and books.
Speaker 1: Do you know what branch--was he in the Socialist Workers Party or the--?
Speaker 2: I don't know and I didn't even know that it was true except that now that I read some of the letters he wrote to her and then put the pieces together you know that they had these book reading sessions at night you know and so it--I was never told it's just sort of me putting it all together.  So I don't know officially--you know in those days it was very dangerous to be labeled to be a socialist, particularly if you were black.
Speaker 1: That's a hundred percent right and especially in the early '50s [1950s] that's when the--Joseph McCarthy was holding senate hearings and that sort of thing.  Red Scare was--and the Iron Curtain with, you know all that sort of thing.  But Detroit if you're going to be a socialist, that was a good place to be one cause there were a lot of labor agitation and social was sympathy--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I think he, I think they--I think he and she knew Coleman Young you know and as a, you know as a lawyer in that community one of the few black women lawyers in the city of Detroit that he as a very prominent guy in terms of his personality, I think they probably knew a lot of folks there.
Speaker 1: So Coleman Young, John Conyers--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --these are the kind of people they were--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I know John Conyers' father was involved in the Labor Movement, came out of the labor agitation.
Speaker 2: Yeah, one of her actual classmates, Mitchell became a famous criminal lawyer for Detroit.
Story_ID: 91525
Speaker 1: You have siblings, right?
Speaker 2: Some, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well let's go over--I want to know like you know if you could name your siblings and tell us where you fit in.
Speaker 2: Well I only have one half-brother, Kent Spencer.  I told that, part of that story.  He's now deceased.
Speaker 1: So is he younger than you?
Speaker 2: He was older.
Speaker 1: Older, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was that first child of my father [Thomas Spencer].  So in terms of immediate family I think that's probably it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So in your household growing up then your household would have consisted of your father, in those early days in Detroit [Michigan] anyway, your father, your half brother Kent--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was off on his own by then.
Speaker 1: Oh was he?  Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I was pretty much an only child.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it would be your mother [Laura Lee Spencer] and your father and you?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So were there any grandparents who were living with you or uncles or aunts?
Speaker 2: Well unfortunately my mother lost her mother very soon.  I only have one recollection of her and so she died quite young.  And, well died not quite young but certainly as far as I was concerned.  And I think by that time my father's grandparents probably did as well.  But they were all in Kentucky so I think no--certainly not in the immediate household.
Story_ID: 91526
Speaker 1: All right, now do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I think I had a difficult time because I lost my father and I think I reacted by doing some blockages.  It was quite a loss for me.
Speaker 1: Hmm, okay.  Now what side of Detroit [Michigan] did you all live on?
Speaker 2: I'm not so sure of the side without looking at a map but Coleman Tire Fac--Coleman--Colfax rather, Pacific.  I think it's near the Fischer Y.  You'd have to tell me what side it was.
Speaker 1: It sounds like it might be the west side of Detroit rather than--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: There's a pocket on the west side that was a black--there's a, the old Black Bottom neighborhood is on the east side you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But I don't--I think that that one was actually being raised as you were coming into--
Speaker 2: Yeah, my school is no longer in existence.  It was Pattin Gale Elementary School which doesn't exist anymore.  So don't really know the city.  I can't really--don't really know, wouldn't know, don't know the sides of the city well enough to tell you.
Speaker 1: Okay, cause you're--you grew up really in two places in Detroit until fourth grade right and then--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in Washington, D.C.--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I guess from fifth grade on.  So here's a quick question we always ask and we always ask it in this way.  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: I don't have a good answer for you.
Speaker 1: Or you could just--
Speaker 2: I don't (unclear).
Speaker 1: --you know what was the difference between Detroit and D.C. in terms of what they look like and what was going on in the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Well Detroit was a, at that time Detroit was a, you know just remembering some friends and the kind of the neighborhood setting.  A little bit of a remembrance of the Broadway market.  That's where my mother had her office, sitting in the hospital.  My father was suffering a lot with high blood pressure.  That's what I remember.  And then Washington was, oh gee, I think like sights and sounds.  That sounds much too--I can't give you that one, can't give you sights and sounds.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  The reason why we phrase it like that is because sometimes it's easier for people to sometimes remember things in terms of sights and sounds and smells, what it looked like when they were growing up you know of course everything has changed.
Speaker 2: Well I mean I remember but it's so non-descript that it wouldn't--it almost does nothing for the listener.
Speaker 1: Well it's not (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: All my memories don't do anything.
Speaker 1: You grew up there and you were in Detroit in the early '50s [1950s] as a little kid.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know and what is--what it was like then is important for people now 'cause it's not like that anymore, you know.  So--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I can't think of anything distinctive that it was like that--it's just like a middle class, middle class neighborhood.
Story_ID: 91527
Speaker 1: What about your school in Detroit [Michigan]?  Were you--what was the name of the school again?
Speaker 2: It was Patten Gale [Elementary School].
Speaker 1: Pattin Gale, how do you spell that?
Speaker 2: P-A-T-T-I-N G-A-L-E, I mean--Pattin Gale.
Speaker 1: Pattin Gale, okay.
Speaker 2: And that was a public school and--
Speaker 1: What was a major street that ran through your neighborhood or what was close by?
Speaker 2: I think Colfax.
Speaker 1: Colfax?
Speaker 2: And Tireman.  It was kind of an--and those were streets that went through a kind of an industrial, or by some industrial areas if I recall correctly.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you like school?
Speaker 2: Not much in the beginning.  It wasn't very challenging.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So were you fairly well prepared at home before you attended school?
Speaker 2: Not particularly but until I got a very good teacher, until I got a very good teacher, I would get--I was bored.  There was--I was get up and walk around the classroom and do stuff and then I finally got a good teacher who allowed me to read on my own after doing whatever exercises they had me do.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Who was this good teacher?
Speaker 2: I can't remember her name but it was a young teacher who was--who had just come.  I think this was like third grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the third grade teacher and did you have a, any particular subject you liked the most in school or--?
Speaker 2: In Detroit?  No.  I don't think I liked most--I liked any of it.  (Laughter).  Well I mean I, I don't think they did a very good job I think actually, at least challenging people except for this third grade teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Third grade is about 1960 right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It's about 1960, this is Kennedy's election and--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was--so when my mother [Laura Lee Spencer] was working of course you know and father [Thomas Spencer] had died at that time.  So I, there--she had to arrange for people to meet me when I walked home.  I would walk home by myself and then there would be somebody at the house or else I would go to somebody's house.  And she had a woman and I remember you know the assassination because she--the woman whose house I would go to, she, well she was just totally broken up when that happened.  Black people loved so--they loved, black people loved Kennedy.  Boy.
Story_ID: 91528
Speaker 1: Now, when did your father [Thomas Spencer] pass?  How old were you when he passed away?
Speaker 2: I was only a couple--it was like first or second grade.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were about seven years old I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah, six or seven, if that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you have any--well what are your memories of your father actually as a--?
Speaker 2: Very few, just--and they've only come back you know recently. You know a couple of snippets of him in the hospital, me visiting him.  I think one memory of him taking me through Broadway Market [Detroit, Michigan] where my mother had her office. A great loss for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, I can imagine.  So did--what was he sick long or--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He had high blood pressure and the medications were just coming out and he couldn't tolerate the medications so he couldn't take them.  Ultimately the high blood pressure caused a heart attack.  But the real symptom was inability to control the high blood pressure.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So dad passed away around 1959, correct?
Speaker 2: Or earlier, yeah somewhere--?
Speaker 1: '58 [1958] or '59 [1959]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, maybe even earlier than that.
Story_ID: 91529
Speaker 1: Now, you were in the fourth grade when your mother [Laura Lee Spencer] moved back to [Washington] D.C.?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so--
Speaker 2: Yeah, she had to move back to D.C.  Well that's a story, lots of stories there.  You know she was told when she finished law school that she should not consider practicing law after getting a law degree.  And--
Speaker 1: Who told her that?
Speaker 2: You know the people at the school, you know the typical stuff we always got you know.  So she said to heck with that.  As she hung out her own shingle. So she practiced workman's compensation law in her own office, brought cases to trial and she loved the law.  She loved the practice of the law.  But as you can imagine a black woman lawyer in those days--
Speaker 1: Yes, it was rare in those days.
Speaker 2: Not only rare but that's not the point, you can't survive.  She would get these clients, she would get black clients who had already given their money to white lawyers before they came to her and a bunch of characters and she told me many stories about these crazy people.  But she loved it, she loved the practice of the law.  And my father's old friend or father's friend was a bit of a shady character.  His name was Joe Brown, bookie.  And he loved, he would love doing the servicing for her.  So he would dress up as a bellman or something and serve her papers and so forth.  And so she had quite a time with these, with that practice.  But at the end of the day you know you couldn't support a family, so had to move back to Washington, take a government job.
Speaker 1: Okay, so all right, so where did she work in D.C. when she moved back?
Speaker 2: She worked for the--she worked a couple of places.  She worked first the Women's Bureau and then she--don't know the order of things.  Maybe she got, came back and got this job.  She worked for many years at housing at HUD [Housing and Urban Development].  She was in the enforcement division of the Equal Opportunity Law.  She was an Assistant Deputy Director of Enforcement, Equal Housing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So she worked in law related but wasn't actually practicing.
Story_ID: 91530
Speaker 1: When you move back [to Detroit, Michigan] you're in the fourth grade, you're nine years old.  This is 19-- yeah that's 1961 I guess.
Speaker 2: Somewhere around there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, [President John F.] Kennedy was killed in '63 [1963] so were you in--?
Speaker 2: So I was probably giving you the dates wrong.  I was probably in Detroit when Kennedy was killed.
Speaker 1: So you were still in Detroit in '63 [1963]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so that would have put you in the sixth grade I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You'd be about eleven.
Speaker 2: Sixth grade, I remember only--I was only in elementary school in Washington [D.C.] one or two years so that's kind of--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --kind of right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so about, yeah about, you'd be about eleven in '63 [1963]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and Kennedy's assassination in Detroit.  Then you all moved and later I guess about '64 [1964] or so, housing--now I didn't know if--you might know this but I know LBJ [President Lyndon B. Johnson] appointed a black director of HUD [Housing and Urban Development], it was a Robert Weaver.  I think he was the first black to work for HUD.
Speaker 2: She [Laura Lee Spencer, Spencer's mother] was there.
Speaker 1: So she was there when Robert Weaver was--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she had a great regard for him.  She also worked under Pat Harris and--
Speaker 1: Patricia Harris, yeah.
Speaker 2: --there was another one.  The republican one came after her, gave a nominating speech.
Speaker 1: Oh, senator from Buffalo [New York], I mean who used to be the quarterback for the Buffalo Bills I think.  Wasn't he the HUD Secretary at one time?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: I'm speaking of the, there was a woman, another woman, another black woman.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Do you remember?  She was a republican.  Well it might, I don't think it was Pat Harris.
Speaker 1: Not the one from Chicago [Illinois], not--I think it's the one from Chicago but I can't think of--I'm trying to think of her name.
Speaker 2: I'm blanking.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Robert Weaver, Pat Harris and then, it would have been under [President Richard] Nixon I guess or something.
Speaker 2: It's Nixon, it was Nixon's appointee.
Speaker 1: Was it Jewel Lafontant, was she the one?  Was it Jewel Lafontant?  No.  Okay.  Anyway it doesn't, you know it's not necessary that point.  I just remember Robert Weaver being the first, I mean he's the first black cabinet appointee I think by a president I think.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Robert Weaver, yeah the secretary of HUD.
Speaker 2: I think she was with Weaver but I know she was certainly with Pat Harris and this woman who I'm very much blanking on now.
Speaker 1: So your mother is a black lawyer in those days.  Her contemporaries would have been Margaret Bush Wilson and Frankie Freeman and people like them.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she knew Frankie Freeman.
Speaker 1: Yeah, from St. Louis [Missouri] and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --there are others too but I can't think, I can't remember all of them.  But I know those two would have been prominent in those days.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Margaret Bush Wilson and Frankie Freeman.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know they both worked for the LBJ administration in one capacity or another.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: As well as having ties with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and all that.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 91531
Speaker 1: Did your mother have like close ties to the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she did.  She did, she actually she worked at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] for a time as a young woman and she sat in on the mock trial, the practice, Thurgood Marshall's practice for his presentations to the Supreme Court at Howard.  The moot trials I think they were called.
Speaker 1: Well she would have been, she would have known Constance Baker Motley too I guess right, from that group?
Speaker 2: Say the name.
Speaker 1: Constance Baker Motley.
Speaker 2: I'm almost certain.  That name sounds familiar.  Yeah, she was a member of the Woman's Democratic Club and she was active with one of her friends was a famous journalist for the-- black woman journalist who she introduced me to later on in life.  She also knew from her early days in Washington, she was part of that circle because of her Dunbar [High School, Washington, D.C.] connections.  She was part of that circle.  You may, don't know whether you know there was this great woman who is the, sort of the Grande Dame of Washington.  She was, you know was the--everything's escaping me now.  You remember, it's the Gregorys and the--Frances Gregory and Gregory--Frances Gregory was an astronaut, was one of the astronauts and the father was--and their family went to--he was the inventor of blood plasma.
Speaker 1: Oh, Charles Drew.
Speaker 2: Drew.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So Gregorys and the Drews.  And there was you know Charlene Drew Jarvis, that family.  Well the mother, grand lady of that and my mother were very close friends.  And I think, I can't remember whether she was a Drew or a Gregory but from time to time I would go to the parties, the birthday parties.  Anyway, I just say that you know Washington was a--for locals in Washington, Washington was a small town and in black society there was a certain hierarchy.  And you know that in that hierarchy for better or for worse it came about you know by virtue of your, you know associations and where you came from and what you did in life and my mother was part of that hierarchy, and for better or for worse, although she didn't buy into it.  My father was dark skinned.  My mother was very light skinned.  Of course in Washington you know that was part of the unspoken hierarchy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So she you know, okay.  Yeah, I know the society in Washington being--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I don't know it, you know from firsthand experience but I know of it by reputation.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So it's interesting that my father was relatively dark skinned.  So I don't know what that dynamic was but he was so charming that I'm sure, whatever obstacles that presented they really weren't obstacles--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --for him.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now what school did you start in [Washington] D.C.?  Where did you go?
Speaker 2: Well, it was LaSalle Elementary.
Speaker 1: LaSalle Elementary School.  Now were you living in northwest D.C. by this time or what?
Speaker 2: I was living northeast, D.C., always.
Speaker 1: Northeast, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Riggs Park, Michigan Park.  Close, near, roughly near Catholic University [Washington, D.C.], that section of town.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay, Catholic University.  Now did you, when did you develop an interest in science?
Speaker 2: Junior high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is about the time then really?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 103371
Speaker 1: So I was asking you about your first interest or you know real focus on science and you said it happened in middle school--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --here in [Washington] D.C., I guess at LaSalle?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?  In--?
Speaker 2: The junior high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: So what was the name of the junior high school?  I thought--
Speaker 2: Jefferson Junior High School.
Speaker 1: Oh Jefferson Junior High School, okay all right.  We jumped ahead a school for some reason.  Jefferson Junior--
Speaker 2: So elementary school--
Speaker 1: Oh okay LaSalle was elementary.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, I got you.  Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 2: So in Washington at that time they had what was called a track program so you could apply for admission to the educated, the educationally accelerated schools.  They were public schools but they were focused schools, much like New York City [New York] had, the Bronx High School of Science and so forth.  Well in Washington we had a junior high school called Jefferson and you had to take a bus to attend it 'cause it was located in southeast Washington or southwest Washington.  I guess it was southeast Washington.  So you had to either be driven by your parents or take a bus to get to Jefferson but it was a really outstanding school, it had really excellent teachers and unfortunately Washington abandoned its track system and lost out on places like Jefferson which were really special.  So my teachers at Jefferson were universally good you know, in the context of public education, very good.  I had an excellent math teacher, an outstanding history teacher and developed a love of history and a wonderful chemistry teacher.
Speaker 1: Can you remember the names of some of those teachers?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  History teacher was Mr. Murray and the chemistry teacher was Banks.  And Jefferson--
Speaker 1: Now are these--?
Speaker 2: --sponsored a science fair.
Speaker 1: Now were these, most of your teachers black?
Speaker 2: They were mixed.
Speaker 1: Mixed, okay.
Speaker 2: The chemistry teacher was black.  The history teacher was Irish.  The physics teacher was black and not, not so great.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what was the school population in terms of the demographics?  Was it--
Speaker 2: Mixed.
Speaker 1: Was it, were black folks at least half of the population?
Speaker 2: Significant but not half.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So would you say a third maybe?
Speaker 2: A third, at least a third and a lot of immigrants you know.  Well not a lot, but some.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So these were the kids--so the children who were there who were white were obviously, because it's public school they were obviously children of parents who were not wealthy because they would have gone to private school.  But the parents were you know struggling but usually--and a lot of times they're immigrants because they were you know well educated but you know struggling to make it in this country.  So I remember we had you know one of our top students was Chikowski (ph).  He was obviously first or second generation Russian and other students whose--who as I think back were probably first or second generation immigrants of some type.
Story_ID: 103372
Speaker 1: Was, was it chemistry that you really were attracted to, I mean that excited you in those days?
Speaker 2: I think it was more toward the physical side.  So I did a science fair project that was of, probably way beyond me but I was lucky.  My mother from her Dunbar [Washington High School] years connected me with Herman Branson at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] who was Chair of the Physics Department and Branson put me with one of his graduate students and helped me with my science fair project.  So--
Speaker 1: Well that's--that doesn't seem fair almost.  Herman Branson, Dr. Herman Branson, the head of--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the physics department I think there, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so--
Speaker 1: He's the founder of the physics department at Howard.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I later on in life, I would meet him.  You see Herman went to Dunbar and was a contemporary of my mother.  And he didn't work with my science fair project.  As you may know, Herman's field was biophysics.
Speaker 1: So he gave you a graduate student that--?
Speaker 2: One of his graduate students--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to help me.
Speaker 1: And what was the project?
Speaker 2: It had to do with ultrasound.  It never really worked but he generously gave me some sort of--because I knew more--because I knew a lot about it but I didn't get the project to work.  They gave me a third place for it or something like that.  And later on I was to find out you know a lot about--I mean I found out a lot about Herman from my mother, you know, personal aside and then I met him.
Story_ID: 103373
Speaker 1: And I you know, when I worked at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] I had him [Herman Branson] back as a lecturer and learned a lot about his life and his work and you know at one point so the people at Howard, Winston Anderson and others thought tried to push to get a little more recognition for Herman.  You know he was on the first publication of the announcement of alpha helix structure by Pauling.  Did you know that?
Speaker 2: No.  He, so he was one of the Manhattan Project--?
Speaker 1: No, no.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So Herman as a young professor, Herman went on sabbatical.  He had gotten interested in biophysics in the early days so he went on sabbatical to Cal-Tech [California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California] and he worked with Linus Pauling.  Now there's a very famous publication by Linus Pauling which is credited in the discovery of the alpha helix structure.  It is the presentation--it is the development of that geometry.  Few people realize that one of the authors of that publication was Herman Branson, Howard University.  And Branson is given credit for a related structure which is of limited scientific use, kind of a variant on the alpha helix, but people always thought that he probably should have been given a little bit more credit in the, you know in the, in recognition for his contribution to probably the greatest discovery in biophysics which is a discovery of the structure of the DNA.  So--
Speaker 2: Okay.  So Linus Pauling won the--
Speaker 1: That's a very big piece of science history that's not well appreciated.
Speaker 2: Did Linus Pauling win the Nobel Prize for this one (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Yes, he shared the Nobel Prize with Watson and Crick, I believe.  I believe that they all shared that prize.  But Pauling may have gotten two Nobel Prizes.  I'm a little shaky on my Nobel Prize history.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I know he was a Nobel Prize winner, yeah, Watson and Crick.
Speaker 1: Now if you go back and look at this paper, I have pulled it many a time with Branson.  It's one of the key papers in the development.
Speaker 2: So you're suggesting that Branson at a time that, when black people weren't getting a lot of credit for what they did, didn't get enough credit for what he did with--?
Speaker 1: Well it's an interesting story.  Because he was only--I mean you know he was in a place which was under-resourced.  He was, he only had the sabbatical leave there at Cal-Tech, you know, to do the, where he did the work. So who's to say?  But his name is on the publication.  He was in the area.  He was truly a brilliant man and had the world been a little different he might have been a Nobel Prize winner.
Story_ID: 103374
Speaker 1: Did you maintain a relationship with Dr. [Herman] Branson over the years?
Speaker 2: I met him later in life when I at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] you know toward the end of his career and very much enjoyed some, a few conversations with him.  We had a seminar series where we invited him back and had--and he gave a talk.  It's an interesting story.  You know he was part of the group--you know Dunbar [High School] was such a great high school.  A lot of families in the south just south of Washington [D.C.], if they had relatives in Washington and they had children who they thought were promising, they would have the children live with the relatives and attend Dunbar because it was such a great place and that's what happened with Herman.  Herman came from a very, very poor family in, I can't remember whether it was Virginia or where it was.  But they had some relatives in Washington and so Herman stayed with them.  And my mother always remembers him as being the one who was constantly curious and interested in physics and displaying the brilliance that he ultimately would use.  He got his Ph.D. in [University of] Cincinnati [Cincinnati, Ohio] I believe.
Speaker 1: I know he later became president of Central State [University] in [Wilberforce] Ohio.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he talked about that.  (Laughter).  He, you know I--he became president because what else could he do?  I mean he was a scientist.  He became president and he say these people would come into his office and he, you know, when he was Chairman of the Physics Department he would say, you know, someone would come in to him selling something.  He'd say "That's the craziest thing I ever heard you know, get out of here."  And when he was president he couldn't do that.  He said "Oh, that's an interesting idea, let's think about it," you know.  He didn't like it.  He you know but what could he do, you know?  You're black and you know there's only--you want to advance, you got to become president.
Speaker 1: Yeah, somebody was telling me the same, a similar story of why they became an administrator after being a physicist or something you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --why they would even do that.
Speaker 2: No choice.
Story_ID: 103375
Speaker 1: You have a science fair project that wins third place but you get excited about science and you get a chance to work with a grad student--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --over at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So okay, this kind of set the tone then?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah that became--
Speaker 1: Now did you have, now what did--what were you like growing up?  What did you like to do?  You go through this.  You lose your father in Detroit [Michigan].  You're the only child basically.  Your mother is a career woman, got a lot of energy, high energy friends and stuff.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean what did you, what--?
Speaker 2: I loved, I liked sports.  I liked playing sports.  I liked reading, you know, like mystery stories, very active.  I liked chess, all sorts of board games.
Speaker 1: Did you have a lot of friends growing up?
Speaker 2: I didn't have a lot but I had, always had a good number you know.  I had a good friend or two in Detroit and a couple good friends in Washington [D.C.] so yeah, always a few good ones.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So now when you move on to high school, where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: So that's a story.  (Laughter).  So Murray [High School] who was--I was probably better in history than in science but I, but at this time--but by this time I had developed a real interest in science.  I had taken, taken ham radio courses, not ham radio but you know radio repair courses in the summer and I was now tinkering with electronics and stuff like that.  And so Jefferson [Junior High School] had this program that was started probably with the help of Murray where they would take a few students in the summer up to Phillips Exeter Academy [Exeter, New Hampshire] and I was one of the few so I spent a summer at Phillips Exeter.  And there I spent most of my time taking courses in the electronics laboratory.  So at the end of the summer they did you know you could interview for the chance of getting admission into Phillips Exeter. So I did and a couple of my friends got in and I didn't get in and I was very heart broken about that.  And so later found out that the reason that, one of the reasons that I didn't get in was that I had a bad psychological profile because I wasn't spending enough time with the people.  Instead I was in the laboratory late after hours in the electronics laboratory working projects so the evaluator didn't see me.  So I was deemed psychologically not ready. Anyway.  So it turned out that you know I ended up going to prep school anyway, not Phillips Exeter but to a much smaller place, New Hampton School in New Hampton, New Hampshire which was I was one of the few blacks that went up there because I had gotten introduced to this whole thing and that's where I went to high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So how was this hooked up?  Was this, was it--did you know some other people going to New Hampton?
Speaker 2: No.  I guess my mother investigated it after you know this debacle with Exeter.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you had the, you tested out fine (unclear), okay all right.
Speaker 2: I tested out fine.
Story_ID: 103376
Speaker 1: Okay, [New Hampton School] New Hampton, New Hampshire.  So what was that like?  Was that a culture shock at all or--?
Speaker 2: Oh it was a tremendous culture shock, extremely small town in New Hampshire, handful of black students, got called "nigger" for the first time.
Speaker 1: By students, administrators, townsfolk or all or--?
Speaker 2: All of the above.  At one point in time, not a lot you know but you know certainly wasn't Washington [D.C.].
Speaker 1: Can you tell me about one of the incidents where you were called the "N" word?
Speaker 2: Well we had a group of students who were going to do I guess what you would call a diversity panel in the, up in Vermont you know, group, black students to another high school or a prep school.  I can't remember which.  And I was up there on stage and in the back the janitor is in the back of the room and he gives me the finger and calls, and says "nigger" under his breath during the time that I'm--
Speaker 1: On a diversity panel, huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Wow, okay.  So well, now were there any--now this is 1960s?
Speaker 2: 19--I was graduated in '74 [1974] so probably--
Speaker 1: '65 [1965]?
Speaker 2: --three years, '67 [1967] to '70 [1970].  Yeah about '67 [1967] to '70 [1970], sounds about right.
Speaker 1: Okay yeah, 'cause you went to junior high school.  So--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you actually started as a sophomore.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you're there three years, all right '67 [1967] to '70 [1970].  So were there any teachers there that are more like mentors to you or that you remember?
Speaker 2: Yeah I liked, I can't remember his name but he was the literate--English teacher.  I was in plays.  I directed plays, I was in plays and can't call his name.  He was a good guy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You remember the plays that you were directing?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  That I directed or that I was in?
Speaker 1: That you were in--both.
Speaker 2: Well I was in as he would say I was spoiled because I was in 'JB' which is an adaptation of the 'Book of Job.'  I played God, Macduff in 'Macbeth.'  And because of the time it was, I directed 'Day of Absence' and LeRoi Jones' 'The Dutchman.'  That shook them up.
Speaker 1: 'Day of Absence,' Douglas Turner Ward.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's one of the classics from that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So that kind of shook the campus up a little bit.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well 'The Dutchman' did if you remember.  'The Dutchman' was a little harsher.  You remember 'The Dutchman?'
Speaker 1: I remember, that's the subway--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the two characters, a white girl and a black rider.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay.  So all this is in high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now how many black students were on the campus?
Speaker 2: Maybe ten or twelve.
Speaker 1: Did you get everybody involved in 'Day of Absence?'
Speaker 2: Pretty much.
Speaker 1: All right, now (unclear).
Speaker 2: It's not such a big play.  It was--not really.  I mean we may have more than twelve but you know the cast was small. We had just a handful.  I can't even remember it so much.  But it was just about three or four people.
Speaker 1: There were a lot of roles in 'Day of Absence' so they can easily--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but there were--
Speaker 1: --have double and triple roles, people running in and out.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we didn't have such a big cast.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  I know a lot of colleges, everybody, all the black students--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, well we didn't--we couldn't do that (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 103377
Speaker 1: In terms of science now did you have good science instruction [at New Hampton School, New Hampton, New Hampshire]?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Wasn't fantastic, good math, physics yeah, I wasn't great.  Well at least I didn't get along so good.
Speaker 1: So that's two schools in a row where your physics teachers were not up to par.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's hard to get good physics teachers, still is, at that level.  You know, hard to get good physics teachers at that level.  It's a big problem.  One of the things Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York] is doing with their centers, they're doing outreach to try to get the teachers up to speed, particularly in physics.
Speaker 1: I heard other people say that when students are interested in physics, once they really get the bug they go all the way for a Ph.D.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So it's hard to find anyone on a lower level to teach it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And to teach it well.  Yeah, it seems like chemistry is a different story.  You find more high quality chemistry professors at the lower level.  I think that's--don't know exactly why that is but it's true.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, all right.  So now did you run for any offices now in school?
Speaker 2: Did I run for offices?  I did damn near everything but I don't think I ran for any offices but I was part of a chess team, debating team, football, lacrosse, basketball, radio.
Speaker 1: You were very active it sounds like.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was pretty active.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How did you, I mean did you have a class rank or something?  Did you rank high in class?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was pretty high.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So in terms of your social life you were a teenager and all that, were there any young ladies, any black young ladies close by or--?
Speaker 2: Nope.  (Laughter).  It's all boys' school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, I thought there might be--sometimes there's a mirror girls' school close by or something.
Speaker 2: There's a mirror girls' school but it wasn't all that close by.  And they weren't all that--
Speaker 1: Yeah, New Hampshire is--yeah it's more isolated.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, so okay, now. Now when you would go back to [Washington] D.C. [from New Hampton School, New Hampton, New Hampshire], did you find that your, I mean did going back allow you to kind of keep pace with what the regular black community was doing?  Or did you feel alienated--
Speaker 2: I suppose.
Speaker 1: --when you went back?  I mean to live in New Hampshire and then go back to D.C., you know which was becoming chocolate city?
Speaker 2: Well you know as time, you know I mean I--high school so it wasn't quite so bad.  But yeah you definitely missed out on a lot in one sense but in another sense I mean we were hitchhiking to Boston and pretty independent.  So we, you know normal high school students are kind of in that you know whatever that bubble is for their high school.  So two sides of that coin I guess.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right so a lot more freedom, a lot more--?
Speaker 2: Well I mean we, as I said we got on the highway and hitchhiked to Boston by ourselves.  So we were you know seeing a bit of the world as high school students.  Some ways it was expanding but in some ways you missed out on a lot of the social life.  But you know at that time the black middle class was into a lot of stuff like Jack and Jill.  Maybe it was a good idea not to be involved in that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Alpha-something, the Jack and Jill, yeah I know the Lynx Club and a lot of different things.
Story_ID: 103378
Speaker 1: Now you graduate [from New Hampton School, New Hampton, New Hampshire] in 1970.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what were your prospects?  Did you get decent counseling?
Speaker 2: Yes, I'd say so.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what did they advise you to do?
Speaker 2: Go to college. (Laughter).  I mean that was assumed after you go to these kind of prep schools.
Speaker 1: Sure, I would imagine so everybody's going to college (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Oh yeah.  So just a question of you know where you got in, that kind of a thing.
Speaker 1: Did you have your sights set on any one particular place?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I wanted to go to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Okay.  What happened?
Speaker 2: So I can't-- so I was--there were two students that I, that were at the top of the class.  It was me and Johnny Lee who is Chinese, and most of the instructor--I mean I did everything there and you know I had pretty good grade point average and my test scores were reasonable and all of that stuff.  And I was--played football and went you know, had a, had, took the option of having half a term in the Peace Corps in New Hampshire and all of that stuff.  So at MIT what they did was they had an MIT alumnus interview you and I had the interview done in Washington, D.C. and it was a really good interview.  And the guy was a great interviewee you know at that time I think he was--they were happy about the fact that you know Shirley Jackson had, just doing well, just graduated, I think--had just come from D.C. and she's doing well.  Either in her Ph.D. or graduated.  And then I got a call to come to the office of the school when I was at school and I said--and they said that they had somebody who wanted to interview me for MIT.  And I said, "Well, I've already been interviewed."  They said, "Well, this person wants to interview you."  This was somebody who was an MIT alumnus who was from New Hampshire.  It was the worst interview I ever had in my life.  Guy said, "Oh you know a lot of our applicants to MIT have built cars from scratch.  You know have you built a car from scratch?"  And it was, and even you know being a young person you don't understand interviews.  But even being a young person I all--I knew that this was the most negative interview I'd ever been in.  As I reflect back on it, you know it still is, but I knew it even then.  And he interviewed both me and Johnny Lee.  And Johnny Lee's brother the year before had gotten into MIT and neither he, neither Johnny, or I, got into MIT and 'til this day I don't know that it's true but I suspect that that guy managed to torpedo both of our chances.
Story_ID: 91540
Speaker 1: So you were like submarined on MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], so you think?
Speaker 2: Well I think so.  You'll never know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So then what were the other options?
Speaker 2: Well the best option that I got accepted, I got accepted at almost every school that I applied to with the exception of MIT.  And I chose Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York] because they had a really good engineering school and a really good liberal arts school.  And it turned out to be a great choice for me.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now did you know anybody at Cornell before you--?
Speaker 2: No, did not.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So you come in 1970, fall of '70 [1970].
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what was Cornell like in the fall of '70 [1970]?
Speaker 2: Cornell was probably the, one of the most if not the most racially supercharged campuses in the country.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Other than the fact that the black students took over the buildings on the cover of 'Newsweek' and such, I think.  What else happened?  I'm just--
Speaker 2: So the black students, as a result of the black student take over, the Africana Center was established and ultimately James Turner was brought in.  Of course the president, [James A.] Perkins lost his job.  When I visited the campus prior to my admission I went to the, to what was the Africana Center at that time and the Africana Center was located in a house on a hill.  And it was a nice place, plush chairs and so forth.  When I came back to the campus, the Africana Center disappeared.  I believe it was burned down. And the new Africana Center had been established.  There were professors who reported to newspapers that they were carrying guns and that if they were approached by black students, they would not hesitate to use them.  There was students had taken books from the new bookstore and set them afire in a bonfire which had caused the fraternities to surround the dormitory Ujamaa with guns again and so that incident had the potential to cause a--there were a number of incidents that had the potential to cause a lot of bad outcomes that were averted at Cornell in the aftermath of the take over.  And Cornell has had a very difficult time in moving on beyond that.
Story_ID: 91541
Speaker 1: Now did you have much interaction with the Africana Studies Department [at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I took a lot of courses there.  The black students loved John Henry Clark and the other professors.
Speaker 1: Yeah, John Henry Clark was there from Harlem [New York, New York] and Dr. Ben taught there.
Speaker 2: Dr. Ben Jacona (ph), you remind me, attended many a lecture with him and then we had Cheston Everett was there, taught theater.
Speaker 1: Cheston Everett, now that's--he's the brother of Dr. Maulana Karenga I believe.
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Who else was there?
Speaker 2: We had a number of visitors from time to time.  There was a Professor Umbata (ph) and then we had a visiting scholar, a very famous person who had spent a year from, I'm blanking, from Tanzania.
Speaker 1: Oh, Ngubiya (unclear), no James Ngubi--or no maybe not him.  I think he's from Kenya I think.  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: I'm blanking.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A lot of famous people would lecture my freshman year, W.E.B. Dubois' wife, Shirley Dubois--
Speaker 1: Shirley Graham Dubois.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Stokely Carmichael several times in both English and Caribbean accents.  Yeah, it was a very active place.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you had, you've talked about having a kind of a lifelong interest in history and culture--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --as well as in science.  And so--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --you really--okay.  So did, so this, the department here became, they just had a controversy over the political nature, I mean the positioning of it I guess in terms of--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, they did.
Story_ID: 91542
Speaker 1: What was the science department like then, I mean the--you majored in--?
Speaker 2: Engineering.
Speaker 1: So what was the engineering department like?
Speaker 2: Well Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York] has always had and continues to have a really outstanding engineering school.  We've been ranked consistently around sixth in the country.  Cornell is probably the first university to offer a program in engineering, has a rather unique position in the, you know, United States.  It was great.  Their physics department has always been one of the best in the country so, yeah.  Hans Bethe was there at the time.  It landed a lot of prestige to the department.
Speaker 1: How do you spell his name?
Speaker 2: B-E-T-H--
Speaker 1: B-E-T--
Speaker 2: Hans Bethe, Bethe.
Speaker 1: Hans Bethe.
Speaker 2: Yep, he was our Nobel laureate.  He invented the equations that describe the fusion process on the sun.  That was his Nobel Prize but he was also a member of the Manhattan Project.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what phase of engineering were you drawn to, basically?
Speaker 2: Electrical engineering, always.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  And someone we interviewed about a month ago was really adamant about explaining the difference between an engineer and a scientist.  So would you like to tell people--?
Speaker 2: Oh I don't know that there's that much difference.  I mean you can--it's sort of simple in one ways.  So scientist seeks to understand what the truth of the world is and so does an engineer.  There's an overlap to some degree but an engineer primarily is about using those truths to make something that addresses the needs of mankind.  So they're just, scientists tend to do what engineers do.  Engineers tend to do what scientists do.  But they are, they overlap but they're fundamental thrust can be somewhat different.  So think about it as two circles like the old Venn diagram where there's an overlap you know.  This is more toward the application.  This is more toward the discovery.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I was asked to ask you about some people who were there.  Do you remember a fellow named Powell Roche?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Powell Batista Roche.  Yeah, he's one of our really top students.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where was he from?  Was he from the United States or--?
Speaker 2: You know I don't remember what his background was but clearly you know with a name like that it's--his parents were not originally from the United States.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Batista is Spanish.
Speaker 2: Yeah, sounds like perhaps even Cuban.
Speaker 1: Yeah, in fact the president of Cuba before [Fidel] Castro was a Batista.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so okay.  Powell Batista Roche.
Story_ID: 91543
Speaker 1: They asked me to ask you about the BEES.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.  We had an organization Black Electrical Engineers which ultimately became part of the National Society of Black Engineers.  So the black--
Speaker 1: So it was black electrical--
Speaker 2: Engineers.
Speaker 1: --engineers, so BEE, right?
Speaker 2: BEES.
Speaker 1: BEES.  So what's the S stand for, Society?
Speaker 2: Yeah, something like that.
Speaker 1: Black Electrical Engineering Society?  Okay.
Speaker 2: It's a good letter to put at the end.  But we ultimately became part of the founding of the National Society of Black Engineers which has grown to be quite an organization.  I was there at the first meeting of that society.
Speaker 1: Now what year was that held, do you remember?
Speaker 2: Good question.
Speaker 1: Is that while you were a student at Cornell?
Speaker 2: I was a grad student I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's like, something like '75 [1975] maybe.
Speaker 1: That sounds about right.
Speaker 2: '74 [1974] or '75 [1975], the last year, about the last year my engineering, my undergrad.
Speaker 1: Now what about Gary Harris?
Speaker 2: Oh my good friend and colleague yeah.  He was, we were together both undergrad and Ph.D.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now the other students I know were there, who were some of the other students on the campus with you in those days that you remember?
Speaker 2: I had another good friend, Conrad Kinley in engineering, Bill [William] Walker, Gary Fitz, Gary Stubbs.  We had any number of students, Lynn Kennedy.  We have a pretty active alumni group.
Speaker 1: Okay, so still active after all this time?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  We, the alumni society, the alumni comes back every couple of years we have a local person on campus from my class who is now part of Cornell development who coordinates these things.  I'm blanking right now on her name but it's easy enough to find it out.  She's now been made an associate dean and so she has--she coordinates a lot of these activities.  So we have, as I said we have the fellowship in Jim [James] Turner's name and a very strong group that meets in New York City [New York].
Story_ID: 91544
Speaker 1: Now someone told me that at a certain point that you were a member of the Nation of Islam [NOI].  Is this true?
Speaker 2: I was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, when did you join and what happened?  How did you get in involved in the Nation?
Speaker 2: Sophomore year and I thought that they were a group that was doing something that was significant.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So there was an NOI chapter in Ithaca [New York] or on campus?
Speaker 2: Syracuse [New York].
Speaker 1: Syracuse, okay.
Speaker 2: Syracuse, Washington, D.C., Buffalo [New York], Rochester [New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you join here [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York] or did you join in D.C. and then--?
Speaker 2: D.C.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  That made more sense.  I was thinking Ithaca you know like--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that wasn't possible here.
Speaker 2: The head in D.C. at that time was Lonnie Shabazz, Ph.D. in mathematics from Cornell.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So did you, well you're not in the Nation now, right?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So I guess you didn't--at some point you got out.  So what was the run, you know being in the nation that length of time and what were your activities when--?
Speaker 2: Two or three years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so you saw them as a group that was going someplace and doing something--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --for the black community and was--I mean what specific thing did you see in the nation at that time that attracted you?
Speaker 2: Well it, I mean at that time there was a lot of lip service given to trying to do something of substance.  And at that time at least in terms of what I was seeing, the Nation was an organization that was accomplishing something that you know that was actually had some foundation of substance.  There were businesses, there were actual things going on.  There were people whose lives were being changed in a positive way, people coming from prison who were being rehabilitated in a real structural way and doing something of significance, treating each other with respect and so forth.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this was a time too, 1970 or '71 [1971] was the time of--there was a ascendancy of Minister Farrakhan as a spokesperson--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --for the Nation.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: I brought him to campus at least twice.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah 'cause I remember people saying that at the Congress of African People in Atlanta [Gerogia] in '70 [1970]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --his speech was the most electrifying and--
Speaker 2: It was.
Speaker 1: --he was on 'Soul' with Ellis Haizlip [African American theater and television producer] where they did a whole hour with him and I mean it was, he was starting to--
Speaker 2: He was.
Speaker 1: --make--
Speaker 2: He was making a tremendous impact.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So you were involved in it for three years and, but you got out of it at some point or didn't--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So what happened after three years?
Speaker 2: Well the mythology was just not acceptable.  And you know, so you know there's things that are allegorical that people were promoting as true and you know at some point it just wasn't tenable for me.  I mean it just, you know just not--you know and then you know there was a bit of schism you know between those people as in all organizations, those people who were highly educated and those who are not.
Story_ID: 91545
Speaker 1: Now there's a, I see you came in [the Nation of Islam] the 1970 and so you got in, in your sophomore year that's about, that's '71 [1971].  About the time you left is about the time that Elijah Muhammad passed away, right I mean or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Yeah, cause he died in '74 [1974].
Speaker 2: Yeah, before.  I think I was out before he passed, significantly before he passed.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well it couldn't have been but a year or so though because he died in '74 [1974] so if you were--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it seemed to me like I was out significantly before that.
Speaker 1: Well college--
Speaker 2: Maybe I was only there for two years.
Speaker 1: College years are a lot longer than regular years.
Speaker 2: That's probably so.
Speaker 1: But yeah he died in '74 [1974] but that's when the whole thing kind of you know flipped over too.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I don't remember him as being a strong influence.  But the influence of the politics that I remember of course was Farrakhan and Malcolm, you know.
Speaker 1: Did you start thinking--so a lot of people were in the days that Minister Farrakhan was extremely popular, people didn't make a connection between the assassination of Malcolm X and the career of Minister Farrakhan. And did you think about that at a certain juncture?
Speaker 2: No, but you, as you recall Malcolm was in disgrace in terms of the nation and was you know being pushed down at the same time he was being lifted up outside the Nation.  Farrakhan was both popular inside the Nation and outside the Nation.  But inside the Nation there was a lot of resentment because of his popularity so there's a lot going on.  There's a lot of churning.  And Farrakhan was brought in by Malcolm.  They were close.  He now had to, he now at that time had to denounce Malcolm.  So that was the, there was a lot of that dynamic that was going around in the time.
Speaker 1: In the circles of the Nation of Islam.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And even outside because you know it's always Farrakhan versus Malcolm.
Story_ID: 91546
Speaker 1: I didn't ask you earlier but was your family very religious?   Did you, were you, did you have a--?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Not very religious but I was an altar boy at one time.
Speaker 1: Is this in the Episcopal Church or--?
Speaker 2: Of course the Episcopal Church.
Speaker 1: Okay, so and so are you, as a scientist and--are you less inclined to be religious or more inclined or does it make any difference or--?
Speaker 2: So I am more in--are you familiar with the work of Joseph Campbell?
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: I'm more inclined to be looking for the unification of spiritual thought as it manifests itself in all religions and what the consequences are of that manifestation.  I do believe that there is a spirituality in the world and I think that for me, Campbell's work seems to have captured it very well.  I like a lot of his ideas.  I've been very fortunate, my students, my Ph.D. students are Chinese, Indian.  I have knowledge, of course my family has knowledge of the Christian tradition.  Islam I know a bit about and so I'm more inclined to see the similarities between all of them as opposed to the differences.
Story_ID: 91547
Speaker 1: So Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York] it seems to me when I look at your outline here, you go all the way at Cornell from--you get your Bachelor's and go all the way through--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Ph.D. so you must have felt at home at Cornell as a home?
Speaker 2: Yeah, somewhat.
Speaker 1: But, well but you also you know got out.  I mean you finished school.  Some people get stuck and they never get out--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but you actually finished school and got, you know--
Speaker 2: Well two places, Cornell and Ithaca [New York].  I mean Washington [D.C.] and Ithaca, felt very much at home at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] too.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now you got your Bachelor's degree in '74 [1974] right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you went on--now most scientists don't even think about the Master's when they are at the level that you're working at and they go on and work on a--the masters is a speed bump on the way to the Ph.D.  So was that the case with you?
Speaker 2: No, I--so my mother was retiring and she said you know she had paid for my undergraduate degree and said that was it for her.  And so I got a job at Bell Laboratories and they did a one year on campus so I got my Professional Master's with Bell Laboratories.  Then went back to work for Bell Laboratories and then they--I was able to get, go back to Cornell for a Ph.D. under fellowship.
Speaker 1: So you were working for Bell labs as you worked on your Ph.D.?
Speaker 2: No I left Bell Labs to go back to Cornell for the Ph.D.
Speaker 1: Oh all right.  So when did you leave Bell Labs to do--?
Speaker 2: About '77 [1977].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 91548
Speaker 1: Now what kind of projects were you working on at Bell Labs and well tell me something about the environment of Bell Labs and as a work environment and what projects were you working on?
Speaker 2: So at Bell Laboratories was divided into divisions or areas, Area 10, Area 20, Area 30, Area 40, Area 50--10 was basic science, 20 was applied engineering, that was my area, 40 I believe was transmission I think or switching.  I can't recall all of them.  But I was in Area 20 and we did power supplies.  I was the only black engineer at Area 20 and my first--and Area 20 had several, a couple of laboratories.  A laboratory is a fairly large group of, fairly large group and then departments, laboratory department then groups.  So, first departmental meeting one of the technicians raises the question about affirmative action hires.  I'm the only black face in the room.  It must have been fifty people and were they qualified, something to that affect.  Oh god, anyway you asked about--
Speaker 1: Well how was that handled?  We can't just skip over that.  Now what--?
Speaker 2: How was that handled?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It wasn't handled.  The question just laid there as the department head sort of moved on and didn't answer.
Speaker 1: There were no affirmative action hires in your department right?
Speaker 2: Well the implication was that I was the affirmative action hire.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right, yeah.
Speaker 2: Being the only black in the room.  And it wasn't handled.
Speaker 1: So, well go on.  So what was that typical of the atmosphere there or was it--did it get better?
Speaker 2: Well it wasn't typical but it wasn't atypical either.  I think you were--I think the way you have to view Bell Labs is it had managers who were both, who were angels, some were angels and others were devils and others were ambivalent.
Speaker 1: Hmm, okay just like in the rest of life I guess?
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: Just like everything else in life?
Speaker 2: Pretty much.
Speaker 1: Every other area.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So I've heard people--now I'll put it like--I've heard people say the people we've interviewed within this month have talked about how Bell Labs had such a wonderful you know, what a wonderful place it was to work because of the way all the you know research scientists were treated and engineers for the most part, freedom to you know explore things and they had well, they were well equipped and they had you know there was a lot of freedom at Bell Labs to explore things and that sort--that's what we were told.
Speaker 2: Well yeah that's absolutely right.  That's probably, there were three places in the country to work and Bell Labs was one of them.  As an MTS, member of the technical staff, I, you know I had a signature authority of a thousand dollars on my own as I recall.  We were more in applied division.  In the research area, Area 10, even more flexibility on what to work with.  Bell Labs was a monopoly that wasn't very well controlled at that time and so the labs were run on one percent of the profits of the Bell system which was a huge amount of money and they didn't have to worry about getting money so that was always there.  So it was a tremendous place to work, wonderful work was done.  It has never been duplicated.  Again, I'm very proud of the fact that I'm an alumnus of Bell Labs in a technical sense and you meet other people who are alumni of Bell Labs and as I said it has, was not duplicated.
Story_ID: 91549
Speaker 1: Okay.  So is there any significant problem that you--well what were the problems that you were trying to solve at Bell Labs [Bell Laboratories] in electrical engineering and what--?
Speaker 2: So we were, you know Area 20 was concerned with power supplies.  So what we were doing was we were developing--the Bell System had a policy of uninterrupted power so that meant that not even for a millisecond could you lose power on your phone system.  And all the phones were powered, to do this, all the phones were powered from central offices.  All the power was sent down on a line through your phones and each phone would--to take up a little bit of power.  So when the electrical grid went out, the central offices continued to supply the power to the phones and because we put the power on battery back up you never lost power cause the batteries would kick in and then within about three minutes the diesels would rev up and so the diesels would then come on.  So in the United States at that time the phones never ever lost their power.  You never lost communication.  And what we were doing as part of the mission of the Area 20 was, we were designing the power converters necessary to accomplish that.  We also did the powering of the undersea cables.  The undersea cables were powered at two points the Atlantic side in the United States and the European side if it was transatlantic cable.  So we were developing the power supplies for the Transatlantic.  We also were developing new power supplies in which you were sharing power from three different sources--two different sources.  It's called a tri-port.  So you would have some power from the grid, some power from a back up supply and you would modulate in between the two.  And then I took an intercompany internship and I, that's where I got involved with solid state electronics.
Story_ID: 91550
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was intercompany internship [at Bell Laboratories] and I worked in developing light emitting diodes and compound semiconductors and that was what sent me back to Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York], the work on compound semiconductors.  That's where I ended up doing my Ph.D.  I also ran into another one of my mother's friends at Bell Laboratories.  We--black, he was the highest ranking technical guy at Bell Labs who happened to be black.  His name was [Walter] Lincoln Hawkins and had a wonderful opportunity to meet him and to talk with him.
Speaker 2: Was he a Dunbar [School] graduate too?
Speaker 1: He was indeed and for a time went out, took my mother out on dates, ended up being the president of American Chemical Society for a time, student of Percy Julian, author of the 'Hawkins Lanza Law,' talks about the protection of undersea cables from water and moisture.  So much history that people don't know.  Percy Julian of course was the famous chemist who has now been documented for his work in biomolecules.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  They found--they made a special about him on NOVA [PBS] on television now.
Speaker 1: That's right.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: The Percy Julian who lived in the suburbs of Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Yeah, ended his life in the suburbs of Chicago, yeah.
Speaker 2: All right.  So, now who was your advisor at Cornell when you worked on your Ph.D.?
Speaker 1: Professor Lester Eastman.
Speaker 2: And what was your dissertation project about?
Speaker 1: I've always been interested in solar energy.  That's how I got into the power supply group was because I thought they were going to do solar cells but they didn't.  So what we were looking at in this dissertation was the effect of imperfections in crystals on the performance of solar cells, these imperfections were called grain boundaries.  So at the time we thought that compound semiconductors could be a material which you could make good solar cells out of.  But in order to make the solar cell cheap you had to use lower quality material so it had defects in it and some of these defects would cause--called grain boundaries.  And what we did in this dissertation is we studied the effect of grain boundaries on the performance of the material and then ultimately by extension the performance of the solar cell.
Story_ID: 91551
Speaker 1: So you earned your Ph.D. in 1981.
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: And then you joined, well you went--did you go back to Bell at that point or did--?
Speaker 2: No, I went to Howard University [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay immediately after '81 [1981]?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right 'cause we have down here 1984, so I can change that.  So you went directly to Howard and how did that hook up take place?  I mean how did you--?
Speaker 2: So the, at that time Rockwell [International] had engaged in a project with Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York] and Brown [University, Providence, Rhode Island] to develop compound semiconductor technology at Howard and I was part of that project and ultimately Gary and I who are contemporaries--
Speaker 1: You said Gary Harris, right?
Speaker 2: Gary Harris, we got to, got accepted as professors at Howard.  They had just lost their senior guy Clifton Samuels a couple of years earlier and so there were openings available.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you're working on a project with Rockwell International, a research project?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and Rockwell was funding some work and the government was funding some work all trying to develop Howard's capability to do research in this area.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now does this lead up to the founding of the Material Science Center?
Speaker 2: Well several years later we applied for a grant from the National Science Foundation and as a result of that grant, as part of that grant we founded the Material Science Center for Excellence at Howard.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what is the Material Science Center for Excellence?
Speaker 2: It was a research group, a research center which focused around electronic materials and their effects and perfection to build devices.  And as part of that center we had several faculty and research associates and obviously students.
Speaker 1: I guess can you break that down a little bit for us in terms of what a common guy like me might get out of that?  I mean in terms of--I still don't understand exactly what you all are doing but--
Speaker 2: Well, so we were looking at different electronic materials.  They were trying to see what the properties of them were and try to evaluate what kind of devices you can make out of them and whether these devices would be useful.  And we focused on a few specific materials.  We ended up focusing on one or two and just studying those in some depth.  And one of the ones that we study a lot at Howard was a material called silicon carbide.  That material is used in things like drill bits and very, very heavy duty structural applications.  But it turns out it can be used as an electronic material as well to make devices which you can convert power.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So just didn't--had more uses than just making a drill bit stronger than--
Speaker 2: Yeah, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So were, as an electrical engineer were you actually making new compounds of things or studying things that already existed or what?
Speaker 2: We were growing the material and trying to get it more perfect.  We were studying the properties of the material and we were making devices out of the material, all of the above.
Speaker 1: All right.  Well what's the most exciting thing that came out of those activities?
Speaker 2: You mean during the Howard time?
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: It's hard for me to give you something that is, that the lay person could--you know it's hard for me to tell you something that will excite you in the way that you would understand.  I would say we, I would say there's nothing that I can tell you--we're a lot of incremental improvements but nothing that I can point my finger to and say that this would really start your engine running.
Speaker 1: Well I don't know.  I think we might be able to understand nuance on some level you know but we don't know everything that happen--
Speaker 2: Well we were able to make and I'm very proud of the fact that we were able to make the, some of the best aluminum nitride in the world at that time.  You know Howard is--didn't have the capabilities.  And we made the first measurements of the optical properties of that material.  Some of these papers are fairly highly cited.  So that was one thing I'm pretty proud of.
Story_ID: 91552
Speaker 1: Now in '85 [1985], you were a recipient of the Presidential Young Investigator Award.  Now who issues that, I mean award?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  The Presidential Young Investigator Award has been around now--that was the second class of it.  It started in '84 [1984] and it continues to this day.  Its name has changed a little bit.  It's a competition that is run by the National Science Foundation and at the--in the first two classes when the first class you actually got to visit the White House and get your hand shaken by the president.  Second class we just got a letter from [President Ronald] Reagan and it's considered to be--so all the young professors try to get it because generally if you get it, it's a big leg up for tenure.  So it's considered to be a big deal.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's an affirmation that you're doing something right?
Speaker 2: Yes, an affirmation that the university did something right in hiring you.  I mean at Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York] we count the number of people who win these kind of awards.  The now, the current you know the current manifestation of it which is called a career award, they're called career awards now.
Speaker 1: Right, right and I mistakenly thought it meant that you got something that should have been given at the end of life than the beginning.
Speaker 2: No it's just--
Speaker 1: But it's an early award for--
Speaker 2: It's an early award.
Speaker 1: --early recognition award.
Speaker 2: Early career award, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now in '87 [1987] the National Science Foundation was awarded--awarded Howard a five year, $5 million grant to institute the Material Science Research Center.  So that's--
Speaker 2: That's the grant that started it.
Speaker 1: Yeah that started it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, in '87 [1987].  Okay, what were your students like at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] in those days?  And I know from what I understand from other professors at Howard, Howard was trying to change direction from being, from burdening the professors with a lot of teaching to allowing them to do a little bit more research.
Speaker 2: Yeah they--during that period of time we did pretty good.  I mean the Howard--you know as I look back you know at that, Howard at that time, we did have a reasonable amount of time to do research and I think it's gone back the other way or never came--you know for example I have visited Clark Atlanta [University, Atlanta, Georgia] and some of the other historically black colleges and they literally do not have any time to do that.  And when I--during my tenure at Howard, we actually did have a reasonable amount of time.  Now I don't know whether that has gone back in the other direction or not.  My suspicion is that the economy is driving it back in the other direction for Howard.  It doesn't seem to be as good as it was during my day there.
Speaker 1: I've been advised by some in academia that there is a tendency on the part of college administrators in the historically black colleges to emphasize the teaching aspect and say well you know we hire you to teach so many classes and not to be as concerned about the research and not even understand maybe the significance of it as a--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you have any thoughts about that?
Speaker 2: Well sadly that is true but Howard at least during my time there had the benefit of some pretty good people.  Michael Winston who was the head at that time on the academic side was himself a brilliant scholar so he under, even though he wasn't a science scholar he was a really good scholar and he understood what scholarship was all about and he understood the needs for scholarship.  So you know in an overall way he was supportive.  And my local chairman, department chairman Eugene [M.] Deloatch who is now the dean at Morgan State [University, Baltimore, Maryland] was also a good researcher.  So we were fortunate at Howard that we had some people during my time who were solid and yeah.  So we were, without them I doubt--the dean, I must say the dean, Lucius Walker was also--understood what research required.  He was a solid guy as was his predecessor, Percy Pierre.  Both understood the needs of research.  So I think we had some good people at Howard definitely.
Story_ID: 91553
Speaker 1: Who were some of your students at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.]?  I don't want to get you in trouble but who were some of your outstanding students?
Speaker 2: We have quite a few.  You know I'm very proud of the fact that the Material Science Center now has produced over one hundred students with Masters and Ph.D.s together, you know throughout--from the time I started 'til now.  And we have a whole list of them who have gone on to do well in industry, and some, and some are teaching now.  One for probably my first student has, became a successful entrepreneur, Moses Asom [Dr. Moses T. Asom].  I think he's, in terms of visibility, he may be the most visible.  But Jonathan Lewis has had a wonderful career at Motorola and Sylvia Wilson is now teaching at, in the Florida University system [Florida], so many, many successes.
Speaker 1: Moses Asom, is he the, I'm trying to think, is he the one that came up with the satellite system for the--?  Maybe not.  No (unclear).
Speaker 2: Don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right cause someone I heard of that I was getting it mixed it up with--okay.  All right, so you were promoted to full professor in 1990.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you became the, in '98 [1998] you became the David and Lucille Packard Chaired Professor of Material Science.  This is, it's funded by the--
Speaker 2: Packard Foundation.
Speaker 1: The Packard Foundation, yeah which is associated with the old cars, right, Packard?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: No.  Hewlett--
Speaker 1: Hewlett Packard.
Speaker 2: Hewlett Packard.
Speaker 1: Different--okay all right.
Speaker 2: That Packard.
Speaker 1: They're different Packards, okay.  All right, okay.  The current Packard Chair is James Mitchell.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what does it mean to be the Packard Chair?
Speaker 2: Well it's a, it was a--I was the first and it's a chaired-- you know, in universities have chaired professorships.  This was Howard's first chaired professorship in engineering to my knowledge.
Story_ID: 91554
Speaker 1: Now 1999, you return to Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York] but what are your reflections about your years at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] and then why did you decide to come back to Cornell?
Speaker 2: So Howard is you know wonderful.  I think we accomplished a lot.  Always a struggle to, although the university was supportive I don't think that they ever made the real investment to move Howard into a competitive position, you know, vis-a-vis what it could be.  So it was interesting, I mean I had research associates who from Russia and from China and we had assembled a really good team and we had broken ground in new areas but we never could move fast enough to be competitive with the outside.  We always sort of--so that was frustrating.  And quite honestly I was beginning to get a little bit cynical and I think once you start to feel like that you know you--what I observed was that a lot of people at Howard as they started to rub up against some of the issues began to be more and more cynical.  So I asked myself a question, you know, "Am I moving the university or is the university beginning to move me?"  And the answer started to come back that the university was beginning to move me and I was beginning to become a cynical person and I didn't like that.  So you know you forget how much positive things that Howard does for people when you become you know more engrossed in the negative frustrations.  So I decided that I would you know see how far I could go at Cornell more on the research side.  And that's kind of bad because--well it was kind of unfortunate because Howard is like home, you know, and you just--Howard loves you and you love Howard and I did and I do.  So coming to Cornell was like leaving home and--
Speaker 1: Was your mother still living in [Washington] D.C. when you left?
Speaker 2: She was.  Yeah, she was okay.  She actually wanted--encouraged me to go.  She had the same frustrations in her life with Howard earlier.  So I did and it's too bad you have to make those choices but I knew that I could never move any further, in terms of professionally, to, you know with the limitations.  I came up with--I recognized that you as an individual cannot rise any further than the group around you allows.  I mean you know you're only part of a group.  You're not, you know you're an interacting piece in a group and so you know you just can't go but so far above what the mean is and if the mean is not going to come up then you're going to always be you know at a certain place and, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now have you tried to or have you been able to maintain some kind of a relationship with Howard in terms of bringing graduate students you know to Cornell or--?
Speaker 2: Sure.  Yeah, we have lots of graduate students come to Cornell.  I currently, I'm going to be PI [primary investigator] in a grant with Howard.  I tried my best to take my sabbatical there but that didn't work out.  I tell you, politics is crazy.  And, you know, wouldn't even mind going back but it's, oh boy, tough, tough, tough, tough.
Story_ID: 91555
Speaker 1: So you came back [to Cornell University, Ithaca, New York] in 1990 [sic, 1999]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --as a--
Speaker 2: Tenured professor.
Speaker 1: Yeah, tenured professor of electrical engineering.  So 2002, you were the Associate Dean of Research and Graduate Studies for the College of Engineering, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was that experience like?
Speaker 2: It was really great.  The guy I worked with before, Kent Fox, was a tremendous individual.  He has a Ph.D. in engineering and he also has a seminary degree.  He's quite an astonishing person.  He is now the provost of the university.  I was part of the strategic planning process of the college and we identified the strategic areas of research that the college would be pursuing.  So, plus I had a chance to go to national meetings to learn about you know focus areas of research.  It was a, really quite a tremendous experience for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you directed the Wide Bandgap Laboratory.
Speaker 2: Well, that's my research group.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay all right.  And you researched semiconductor materials like the ones in--
Speaker 2: Some carbide, aluminum nitride, more recently graphene, polydisulfide, boron nitride.
Speaker 1: And I'm to ask here on this outline ask you, what is the difference between gallium nitride and gallium arsenide semiconductors?
Speaker 2: Oh gosh, well that gets into a lot of insider baseball.  So I mean these are different materials with fundamentally different properties and different applications.  So gallium nitride emits light.  It's the material that you see in all these new billboards and stuff like that you know that you see in the world.  Gallium arsenide is what you make microwave radio transceivers out of.  So totally different electronic properties and that's what we do is to study them and try to find out what works for what.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The next question is what is the best material for a semiconductor?  I guess it would depend on the application, right?
Speaker 2: Absolutely right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Let's see, think we can move on here.  Tell us a little bit about graphene too as a, you know what is that and what--?
Speaker 2: So we have a, at Cornell we have a, Cornell's had a long tradition of materials research.  We have one of the best materials groups in the country and our interdisciplinary research group is called the Center, Cornell Center for Materials Research and that's broken down into interdisciplinary research groups.  And for the past seven years, I guess six years or so, we've been studying graphene and now we're extended that study into two dimensional materials.  These are materials which are, essentially have all the bonds, all the connections between the atoms in plain.  And they're only one atom layer thick, just one atom, all the bonds in plain.  Graphene is one of the members of that group but there are others members of that group.  And so these materials which we classify broadly as two dimensional materials have unique properties that we're exploring and these two dimensional materials are very exciting and they represent the new frontier for electronic materials and devices.  And you can imagine the challenges of trying to control something that is only one atom layer thick and to try to understand the properties of it.  It's really quite amazing that we can do it and it's quite astonishing.  And we are in competition with the best universities in the country and in the world and it's quite something to be at the forefront of anything, quite humbling and quite exciting.  I thoroughly enjoy that part of it.
Story_ID: 91556
Speaker 1: Tell us about Widetronix.
Speaker 2: So we founded a company to produce silicon carbide material and my student Chris [Christopher] Thomas who is Jamaican, former member of the Jamaican National Soccer team is the chief scientist and Cornell M.B.A. person graduate, Jonathan Greene is our Chief, is our CEO [Chief Executive Officer].  I am now, my position with the company, I was the founder of the company.  I'm now, my position is a consultant.  So you know we're totally stereotyped.  The CEO is Jewish, the CTO [Chief Technology Officer] is Jamaican and at one time we had an Indian as one of the chief scientists.  Anyway, we started out focusing on silicon carbide materials supplier and we ended up looking at a particular device made from silicon carbide called a nuclear battery or beta voltaic battery.  And this battery is powered by radio isotope which emits high energy electrons.  Those high energy electrons get converted into electricity and the battery will last for twenty-five years because it's a nuclear battery and it provides small amounts of power but enough power to power a medical implant.  So the company is now developing a prototype of this battery and has been for a while.  It's doing--it's still surviving, doing very well.  Applications of this include medical monitoring as well as anti-tampering.  So if the, you know somebody, the government is trying to protect circuits you know that control classified functions, if someone is going to tamper with that, you need a standalone battery that can protect that and this does.
Story_ID: 91557
Speaker 1: So we were talking about Widetronix and you said you got a, your CTO [Chief Technology Officer] was from Jamaica?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what was his name again?
Speaker 2: Chris [Christopher] Thomas.
Speaker 1: Chris Thomas, all right.  Okay, and you were working on a battery project.
Speaker 2: We were working on nuclear batteries.
Speaker 1: Nuclear batteries.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay, and Widetronix, I guess it's still you know--
Speaker 2: Still going.
Speaker 1: Still going and what are your prospects for Widetronix?
Speaker 2: Well, we are trying to get the first real prototype going.  We have been funded and, by major medical companies and if we can prove out our batteries they have guaranteed to be a customer.  We've had at least two venture capital rounds and several government contracts so we're trying to finish the first manufacturable prototype.
Story_ID: 91558
Speaker 1: Tell us about some of your publications and would it be correct to generalize that you are publishing more at Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York] than you did at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I would say so.  Certainly more in terms of numbers and also citations are higher, the number of citations are higher.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's when someone else uses your research?
Speaker 2: Yeah, when someone else--
Speaker 1: Cites what you're--
Speaker 2: --cites your work in their publication.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  What are some of your papers and I want you to talk about some of your patents too.
Speaker 2: Well, we have on the patent side, we have of course in a small company you always--patents are more important.  So we have some patents on ways of getting more power out of beta voltaic batteries or nuclear batteries.  So power meaning power density and so that's one major area of patenting.  In terms of publications, we have, we did a lot of work on using something called scanning probe microscopes to get information about semiconductors.  So a scanning probe microscope is based on the material that is piezoelectric.  Now piezoelectric means that if you apply electricity to this material it moves a very, very small distance.  So in a scanning probe unit you have a little tip which is moved very small distances by these piezoelectric manipulators and as that tip comes close to the surface of the semiconductor it will experience a force and that force that it experiences can be measured.  Now using that force and a lot of other things related to it we can make very nice measurements about some of the properties of the material.  We can determine what are the electric fields that are coming from dislocations and other problems and so we use that, those techniques.  It's called Kelvin probe microscopy to characterize a material.  And we were some of the first to do that and so that publication has received a lot--those series of papers have received a lot of citations and that work was started when I came to Cornell.  Some of the more recent graphene work in which we have demonstrated a way of actually producing suspended membranes of Graphene.  So I told you that graphene is one atomic layer thick.  Well we can actually make a membrane that is suspended in space bound on either side, it's suspended and this one atomic layer is literally in space.  And so you can actually see right through it with an electronic microscope.  And it's really quite amazing that you can actually, that one atomic layer of atoms will self-support but the other amazing thing is you can actually make useful devices out of this one atomic layer.  You can put it into vibration and you can make lots of things.  So this particular way of suspending the membranes has also you know been given a lot of attention.  We're completing a paper now in which we have demonstrated for the first time producing graphene on another material called sapphire and we have studied and we plan on submitting this to the journal 'Nature.'  I'm very excited about it.  We have studied the way in which the potential of the substrate will actually align the graphene films so that paper has yet to be submitted but it will be soon.  And I don't remember what all the things that I put down, one of the other papers I put down on there.  I think I probably put down something about a measuring properties of aluminum nitride which we've talked about and we also--and then there was the initial work on grain boundaries which we're very proud of.  And you know there, I think there are a number of other things but I think, you know I have over one hundred and twenty publications so I think that's a good--I think right now is a good place to stop.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 91559
Speaker 1: This year you coordinated the Air Force Office of Scientific Research at Columbia's Multi-Disciplinary University Research Initiative, grant for Graphene Materials from Microsystems Devices.  This is a long word here but can you kind of summarize what this is?
Speaker 2: So you know we always have these groups that come together to get money from the government and so at Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York] and Columbia [University, New York, New York], we have put together a team that we've gotten, MURI which stands for Multi University Research Initiative Grant.  These grants are for five years and this grant was to study graphene.  And about ten, I guess about, more like fifteen faculty member in this project, jointly between Columbia and Cornell and we have some of the best faculty in the country who are working on graphene who are working on this.  It's been a real thrill.  And I have been sort of the coordinator of the Cornell side.  That's just more of an administrative thing than anything else, but just good to be part of the team.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  So your work with--would you say your work with graphene's the most, I guess the important thing you've been involved with as a research--?
Speaker 2: Well that's the most current thing.
Speaker 1: Current thing, okay.
Speaker 2: But I guess I'm probably best known for silicon carbide.  I was a, I started the conference on silicon carbide along with Gary Harris, a conference that has been gone for several years now and since we started at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] and it's gone on until now.  And we've done work on all kinds of silicon carbide from thin film to bulk.  So I would say that probably the community knows me best for silicon carbide although I'm gaining a reputation in 2-D [two-dimensional] materials, but silicon carbide and even aluminum nitride and in the much early days, grain boundaries.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when you look back at your career then as a materials--as an electrical engineer, what today would you say is your legacy?
Speaker 2: So we have made a number of good advances and some of them are quite cited.  But you have to be a little sanguine.  Most results in science except for a very few are just incremental steps that are not going to be remembered.  I think the thing that I'm most proud of is the Material Science Center at Howard and the fact that we've touched you know the lives of so many people and inspired others.  And I think that that's probably going to be the biggest legacy for me anyway, has been that.  And I'm also excited to see how far Widetronix will go as a company.  So those are the two, I think those are the two things that will have--you always like to talk about impact.  I think those are the things that will have the most impact.  A few publications here and there but you know a person like you who's not an insider will probably never know or hear about them.  They're not any, there's not in any great laws but I think the other is something to be proud of.
Speaker 1: Well I think like hearing your story like gives me a deeper appreciation for what a research scientist does and I realize it's not you know the homeruns you see in the history books of somebody who discovers this or they did you know it's not always like that.  But it's something that you might discover in research might be a part of something like that and so (unclear).
Speaker 2: Right, you know that's always true and that's a good thing.  You're part of the progress of the science.  You've made a step you know, hopefully an important step but certainly a step.  But very often that step is forgotten when the next step is taken by anybody except the people who are, you know who are the experts.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well science is more of an accumulation of--
Speaker 2: Accumulation of small steps.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that led to the momentum of some--
Speaker 2: Yeah, absolutely.
Speaker 1: --forward flow, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 91560
Speaker 1: Now is there any major thing that you would do differently when you look back on your career?
Speaker 2: Professionally?  Not a thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Been a wonderful career.  I've been very blessed and had wonderful experiences.  Russia, China, Brazil, Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], Cornell [University, New York, New York], couldn't ask for anything more.
Speaker 1: Now these trips to Russia, China, Brazil, are these like extended stays in these countries to--?
Speaker 2: I've been several times but I had longstanding colleagues and relationships you know, people who worked with me for years.  And so I know the Russian laboratories, the Russian scientists and I had a Chinese colleague, visited China several times.
Speaker 1: Now there's a lot of talk about the weakness of STEM [science, technology, engineering, mathematics] education in the United States and that we're falling behind.  Do you think that that's true in terms of--?
Speaker 2: We are.  Oh we are.   We are, not at the college level, not at the highest level.  We're still the best research universities in the world.  But at every other level we're falling behind.  It's true.
Speaker 1: So we're a country with a, I don't know how to characterize it.  It would be like an animal with a big head and a little body or something or--you know I don't know how to--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well in terms of, you know I mean if you look at our graduate students in our STEM studies, 60 to 70 percent are non-U.S. citizens.  And of the remaining percentage if you add first generation Asians, either Indian or Chinese who are U.S. citizens and then you look for the ones that are after that percentage is done, how many do you have who are non-Asian you know in the highest levels of graduate studies.  That number, that percentage would be very small indeed.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So our great research institutions are really serving the rest of the world better than they're serving their own--I mean in other words our people are not getting to that level--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's--
Speaker 1: --to take advantage?
Speaker 2: Well a certain segment of our population, certain ethnic segment of our population, the best and the brightest are choosing to go into medicine and law as opposed to the STEM fields for obvious reasons.  There's more money there.  So that's where our best and brightest are going.  Meanwhile, you know, the first generation U.S. citizens who are Asian are going into STEM fields and some people who have a great passion for it do it and then we get a lot of people who are coming from abroad.  And they are benefitting this country greatly because they provide the stimulus for the technology industries and all that stuff so the United States is getting tremendous benefit out of these folks, but we are not producing them in our first tertiary and second--our primary and secondary education systems.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Are not producing these people to the extent that which we should.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now have you been involved with any voluntary efforts to push STEM education in the schools?
Speaker 2: Not too much.  We do that at Cornell you know in--throughout our centers and so forth but directly myself not really.  When I was at Howard I gave some presentations but those are sort of one-offs.  No, I haven't done any consistent effort.
Story_ID: 91561
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Oh gosh, I have a lot of concerns.  The world is non-linear so if you're behind by two today, you're going to be behind by four tomorrow.  It's hard to catch up.  And the world is also as [Thomas] Friedman points out, it's flat.  And I've had the privilege of understanding exactly how competitive it is.  India, China, South America, all very competitive and I don't see the black community doesn't even understand what the nature of the game is.  We're--not much less compete.  We certainly have a good idea what it is to compete athletically.  We don't even really understand what it is to compete on this intellectual playing field for the new technologies of the future.  And the difference between Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] and Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York] in terms of being in the flow of knowledge, it's so dramatic as to be almost inexpressible.  So I don't know how we're going to get from A to B.  I don't know how African Americans in this country will as a large group be able to compete in this new global economy.  There will always be individuals who I have seen, individually there's more and more success and I--and as a--where there are much--there are many more Ph.D.s, high quality Ph.D.s.  At Cornell we have young faculty of color, they're fantastic.  And individually we'll see much more of that.  We'll see blacks taking their position in leadership and so forth but as a group, as a group I don't--and I pride myself on problem solving.  I don't see that solution and it concerns me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 91562
Speaker 1: Tell us something about your family.  Now did you ever marry or have any children?
Speaker 2: I did marry.  I had one child and he's Thomas.  I'm very proud of him.  He's studying for his Ph.D., started the program at University of Virginia [Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University], Blacksburg [Virginia].  He's got a Masters from Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York] and undergraduate degree from Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now your mother [Laura Lee Spencer] passed away--
Speaker 2: 2003.
Speaker 1: 2003, okay.  And now so you, and so you were married at one point but you're not, I take it you're not now, I guess?
Speaker 2: I am but not going well.
Speaker 1: Oh okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Sad to say.
Speaker 1: It's tough being married and being a research scientist or is it just--?
Speaker 2: I don't know the answer to that question whether that's the fault or--clearly it's, yeah, well, clearly this was the second time around and I'm not sure that's--that this is going to end in, have a happy ending.  So I have to--and another problem which I don't have an answer to.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now we were talking off camera about life at Howard.  You think you'll ever go back?  You were talking about (unclear).
Speaker 2: I'd love to back.  I'm not sure they'll let me back.  (Laughter).  It was wonderful.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and we were alluding to a cultural dimension that's at Howard that you can't find here.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah well you know Howard is home, yeah.  Everybody, everybody, everybody wants to go home.
Story_ID: 91563
Speaker 1: Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Oh gosh.  I guess as a, well by my son as a father and by my surrogate sons as a teacher or a mentor.  These would be my Ph.D. students who I've had wonderful relations with.  Very close to being a son--sons or daughters, so Chinese sons, Indian sons, one white woman daughter, black American daughter. Been a very, very rich experience.
Story_ID: 91564
Speaker 1: This one's easy cause it's labeled.  This is August 1st, 1952, I'm five months old.  That's my dad, Tom [Thomas Spencer] who was one of my great losses in life and that's me.  And that's a house in Washington [D.C.] and in Detroit [Michigan].  Okay.  This is the date, the date would be, late '80s [1980s] I think or I can find out.  And left to right I'm pretty sure from the right side it's [Dr.] Herman Branson, myself, Dr. Winston Anderson and I believe that's Dr. Branson's wife.  This was a lecture that Dr. Branson gave at Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  This is after the lecture.
Speaker 2: This is about what year you think?
Speaker 1: He said '80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: In the '80s [1980s] but I can find out.
Speaker 1: All right, good.
Speaker 2: This is probably seven--1968, myself at New Hampton School [New Hampton, New Hampshire] as a thespian playing Macduff.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is the late '80s [1980s] or early, no this would be in the '90s [1990s] maybe around '96 [1996], my son on the left and myself in the center and my colleague for many years at Howard originally from Shanghai, China.  We're in Suzhou, the Gardens of Suzhou and I'm visiting China being toured by him.  Okay.  Don't know when this picture was taken but it shows, it was put together by my uncle and godfather.  It shows six generations and great-grandfather, Benjamin Franklin Spencer, Sr., born a slave in 1953 [sic, 1853]; his son, Ben, Jr., my grandfather born 1988 [sic, 1888] and my father Thomas Franklin Spencer born in 1910 and his wife Sue Spencer.
Speaker 2: And the first two where you said 1950 so you mean 1853 and 1888.
Speaker 1: 1853 yeah and 1888.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, okay.
Speaker 1: This is my mother Laura Lee Spencer.  This is--was taken in I guess this was taken in the '60s [1960s] when she was in the Labor Department, the Woman's Bureau.
Speaker 2: Top one.
Speaker 1: Top one is Christmas for me in Detroit, probably when I was one or two so it would be '53 [1953], something.  Bottom is my son born in 1983 and myself.  So this is a tintype.  Tintype is a type of photograph and this is Mamie who according to my uncle was the relative that we know actually came off the boat from Africa and this is her picture.  She never knew how old she was when she came off the boat but she said she was old enough to stir the pots.
Speaker 2: And she was your father's--?
Speaker 1: On my mother's side.
Speaker 2: Your mother's (unclear).
Speaker 1: My father's wife's side, sorry.
Speaker 2: Okay, father's wife's side.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And, here's another--
Speaker 1: Same picture of her I believe.
Speaker 2: Older, right.
Speaker 1: Older, same picture of the same woman but older, another tintype.  And this is a picture of the Spencer Shoe Shop that was in continuous existence for over a hundred years at the train station in Frankfort, Kentucky, right across the street from the train station.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So this shows the father and all of the sons, my father on the far right, his three brothers.  My godfather is second from the left and my grandfather in the center.
Speaker 2: And their names?
Speaker 1: Thomas on the far right, Thomas in the center, Buss, Brother Buss, I don't know his right name and John Spencer second from the right.  The other brother I'm blocking on right now.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's the far left one that you (unclear).
Speaker 1: Oh, my son Thomas in braces.  This is me when I graduated from college; my uncle and godfather who told me all the stories, John Spencer; my mother's favorite picture of me.
Speaker 2: Can see why, looking sharp.
Speaker 1: Ben Spencer, great-granddad and his wife Sue.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: My mother and I in Detroit on the porch; my father as a young man, Thomas.
Speaker 2: Dashing.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he looked like a star at the movies (unclear).
Speaker 1: Let's see, I think this was an 'Ebony' article, don't know the year but probably late '80s [1980s], taken in the Materials Science Center, myself and Gary Harris.  This may have been, let's see--
Speaker 2: When is this?
Speaker 1: 'Emerge,' another article.
Speaker 2: 1993.
Speaker 1: 1992.
Speaker 2: Three.
Speaker 1: 1993.
Speaker 2: Probably have it at home.
Speaker 1: Hmm?
Speaker 2: I probably have it at home.
Speaker 1: Ben Spencer's teaching certificate, B.F. Spencer, teaches second grade given in March 16th, 1878.
Speaker 2: Isn't that something, 1878.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's it.
Speaker 2: All right.
