Story_ID: 9864
Speaker 1: Okay, we're going to start out, and I want to ask you to tell me about--give your father's name and what you know about his background and his growing up.
Speaker 2: My father's name was, is also Stanley Lathan.  I'm not a junior because I'm not--I wasn't the first born.  He was born in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  I'm not sure of the year, early, early 1900's, I mean early--yeah, early 1900's.  And I don't know a lot about my father because it, as--at the age of 3 or 4, he was no longer with us, no longer with the family.  And he and my, my mother, you know, sort of split up, and he kind of disappeared from my life.  We heard--we got word that he died a few, probably somewhere in the, in the '50's [1950s] when I was around twelve years old.
Speaker 1: And your mother, can you give her name and, and tell us what you know about her background?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Julia Elizabeth Dunston was her, was her maiden name.  And she was born in South Carolina.  She lived in Columbia, South Carolina for a long time and then she and her mother moved to Philadelphia also.  And so she was kind of raised in Philadelphia.  And she worked various jobs and, you know, and spent a lot of time in her adult life trying to, to better herself, trying to--and she ended up, you know, she worked as an elevator operator.  She did housework and things like that.  And she finally ended up working for the Federal government in the IRS division, you know, in some office in Philadelphia.  That's where she worked until she retired in her, you know, 60's [1960s].
Speaker 1: Do you know what brought her to Philadelphia?  Do you--
Speaker 2: Well, sort of, you know, I think--I'm not sure exactly what their reasons for moving was, but most of her, much of her family, her extended family had already settled in, in Philly and so her mother bought she and her sisters to Philly.
Speaker 1: Can you describe your mother, what type of person she is?  And what you think you might have of her?
Speaker 2: She's, she was a, a very nurturing mom.  She, you know, she was a striver like much of our family in that, you know, she always wanted better for herself and for her, her kids.  She worked hard.  She worked two jobs, you know, a lot of the time when we were, when we were growing up.  There was never any doubt in anybody's mind that college was a absolute goal, and she pushed that and, you know, saw that we, as kids, you know, developed a certain discipline towards school and preparation.  And she was firm, but she was really a sweetheart and very, you know, very attached to her extended family and her sisters and who were our aunts and so forth.
Speaker 1: So you grew up around--you had a lot of aunts when you were growing up (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Aunts and uncles and cousins, yeah.
Story_ID: 9865
Speaker 1: Now, you're--can we have your siblings' names and in birth order and where you fit in that birth order?
Speaker 2: I'm the youngest.  I have a half brother, Charles who is twelve years older than me.  I have a brother William who is eight years older than me.  And I'm the baby.
Speaker 1: So there were three boys?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Story_ID: 9866
Speaker 1: Now, do you, what is your oldest memory of growing up?  I mean youngest, sorry?
Speaker 2: My youngest memory is actually, I can actually remember standing at the window in our home, in our house, in our apartment or house in the projects of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] waiting for my mom to come home from work at night because she worked at night.  And I can remember standing there and night after night I would stand there and just kind of watch and wait for her to come home.  And I had to be--I couldn't have been older than three or four because we were, you know, we moved to another project a little later than that.  I also actually have a, a visual memory of my father and my mother in a scene in the kitchen that was unpleasant.  And it's blurry but I remember it.
Speaker 1: They were fighting or arguing?
Speaker 2: They were fighting and arguing, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, tell me about your neighborhood and what you remember about the neighborhood you grew up in?  You know, do any, any anecdotal stories, any just description--
Speaker 2: Well, I lived in a couple of different neighborhoods.  There were two projects.  There was the Richard Allen Projects [sic. Richard Allen Homes, Philadelphia] and the James Weldon Johnson Projects [sic. James W. Johnson Homes, Philadelphia].  I remember, I vaguely remember the Richard Allen Projects.  And is that the call?
Speaker 1: You said, you said, I was asking you about what your neighborhood was like--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And you said well, I have one memory from the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That was the one, was waiting by the window.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, okay.  Sorry.  And then, but let's--can you tell me what you were like as a young--a little boy?
Speaker 2: I think I was a cute kid.  I think I was very inquisitive.  I had two older brothers that were very active, very popular, very smart.  So they were--and I looked up to the one that was closest to me, the one that was eight years older.  And so as I was--and I think that he was a very motivated young man.  He went to medical school and, you know, became a doctor.  He was a, a kind of a leader in his group of friends and, you know, did really well in school.  And, and so he was always like, well he was my role model for the most part.  And so I tried to be like him.  Tried to be, you know.  And I was inspired by him too, to work hard and to--and this is even as a little kid.  I took piano lessons at a really young age in the community center that my, my Mom sent me to.  And then when that dried up, I'd stopped because she couldn't--she wasn't able to pay for lessons.  There was no where to get them for free again and so that was--
Speaker 1: Well, let's, let's take you back there.  And I'd like you to just talk about what sights, smells and sounds remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: I sometimes walk into places, into small cramped quarters.  And there's this feeling that I get of, that reminds me of growing up, I guess I should say.  I wouldn't say it reminds me of home, but it reminds me of rooms that I would spend, you know, that I entered as a kid.  Rooms like at my grand Mom's house, it's even my house, you know.  There's a, there's a certain--certainly the, the smell of fried food is something that often sends me back.  The smell of bacon in the morning.  I'm sure this is pretty standard.  Bacon in the morning is something that really makes me think about very specific images of my home, of my home life.  I think of things like the can of used grease on the stove which--and oftentimes when I'm in a--even on a public street and I, and I smell the exhaust from a, from a, you know, restaurant or a stand, food stand where they're frying stuff, I often wonder how old that grease is because when, you know, my mother had a thing about saving it, but she didn't keep it around long because it also replenished itself from the bacon and stuff.  So--and I guess there's a, a kind of a musty smell that sometimes reminds me, you know, of my grandmother's place, grandmother's and the smell of Noxzema reminds me of my grandmother's bedroom because it was real strong.  And sights and sounds.  I was, you know, a city boy.  I grew up in the city, in the city of Philadelphia so I guess I'm more aware of silence as some, as a contrast to what I was used to.  And so I'm, I'm sometimes uncomfortable in situations where there's an extended silence like in the woods or somewhere like that.  I think I need to hear trucks rattling around and stuff every once in a while, buses.
Speaker 1: And that was a good question.
Speaker 2: Well, there's not usually a standard answer.  Everyone has their own, you know, memories.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: But you know, I--tell me though, what was your neighborhood like?  I mean what--you know, the environment that you sort of circulated in.  Can you describe?
Speaker 1: Well, from my early, I mean up until the junior high, maybe up until around 9th grade, I lived in north Philadelphia.  I lived in two projects, one was Richard Allen Projects and one was the James Weldon Johnson Projects.  And they were, you know, relatively, I guess they could, considered rough.  Yes, see I'm not a talker, you know.  You're, you're pulling it out of me right now.
Story_ID: 9867
Speaker 1: Can we talk about your experience in elementary school?  Were you excited about going to school?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, absolutely.  And I was very--I was always, I always loved school.  I, from day one, from kindergarten to the, till I graduated from high school, even college, I mean, you know, I loved school.  I loved learning.  I think I was conditioned to, you know to want to pack a lot of things into my head.  I wasn't the greatest student in the world.  I mean you know, there were--I was always aware there were kids that were smarter than me, or I felt like they were smarter than me, that they retained more information, that they, you know, they had--I always had a problem with math to this day.  And so even in elementary school I had to work harder than most others.  I felt I did.  I assumed I was working harder.  I did well, but, you know, I kind of, I kind of worked at it.
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers that influenced you (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I remember my third grade teacher, Mrs. Titus very well and Mrs. Taylor, my fourth grade teacher.  They were old, old women.  They were all, you know, they were white women.  They were, they were--and they were old then.  I mean they were like, they seemed to be really old.  But they were really educators, you know.  They were very, very stern.  The classes were good size.  There was, it was, you know, well mixed racially, this particular school that I went to because my, my mom made it a point to somehow manipulate the jurisdictional thing.  And actually I had to even in elementary school I had to travel a distance.  She did that in elementary and junior high.  And I don't know how she did it now.  I mean looking back I don't know how she did it because all my other friends went to the neighborhood school.  And I was able to--well, I had an uncle who was, who worked in the, in the educational system, who was a principal at a school.  And I'm sure that he was very much involved in that process.
Story_ID: 9868
Speaker 1: Well, when you--I know you said you were cute as a little boy, but besides that, were you, were you shy?  Were you a dreamer?  Were you rambunctious?  Were you well-mannered?  Were you mischievous?  I'm just trying to get a--
Speaker 2: I think I was shy.  And I was a dreamer.  And I was very comfortable playing by myself.  I could spend, you know, hours and hours by myself.  Often, you know, and I often had to do that because we were, you know, my mother, as I said, my mother worked nights.  And my brother who was, I guess when I was three or four, he was eleven or twelve, was kind of, you know, in charge.  And we weren't interacting that much together.  So, and that was prior to television also for us.  So I spent a lot of time alone and creating my own kind of entertainment.  And I just, I guess, I guess I was a dreamer, pretty much, spend a lot of time (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: So what were, what were you dreaming about or what were you creating in your mind?  I mean were you, was it cops and robbers?  Were you, you know, reading about places far or were you--I mean?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  See we're talking--I'm talking three and four.  I think you're talking eight and nine.
Speaker 1: Oh, (laughs)
Speaker 2: I was a very, you know, once I learned to read I was reading, I read everything.  I used to read the newspaper.  I used to read, Reader's Digest was one of my favorites, and I would read it from cover to cover.  And I used to go to my Aunt Gladys' house after--well, once, once we moved out of the projects and into West Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], which was, I guess I was around ten or eleven, I used to go to my Aunt Gladys' house and, after school, rather than to my home until dinnertime or so.  And then I'd walk to where we lived.  And they had a bunch of stuff magazines and books and so forth.  So I would--I used to read Life Magazine religiously.  They always had that.  They had Readers' Digest. They had Time Magazine.  And they even had I think it was the New Yorker.  I remember I used to always go through the New Yorker looking for the cartoons because they would always have these kind of political, semi-cool cartoons.  And whatever books were, you know, were, were assigned in school, I would, you know, I would finish them immediately.  So--
Speaker 1: So you became very aware of the world outside?
Speaker 2: I--yes, I did.  But that was kind of, you know, thrust upon us also as a, as something that we should be aware of, that we should be aware of the world beyond the one that we, you know, existed in.  I think that was part of the strategy to get us to, you know, to think beyond our, our own means.
Story_ID: 9869
Speaker 1: Now, when you went to junior high, where was that?
Speaker 2: That was Jay Cook Junior High [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], which was a great distance from our home.  I used to have to take two sub--two, I'd have to take a bus and a subway.  And it was a school that was ninety percent of the students were Jewish, ninety.  On Jewish holiday, it was empty.  They wouldn't stop school, but we would show up and there would be two people in the class.  And, my, you know, my folks had this--well Mom had this theory that the Jews would make sure that the schools were good that their kids went to.  So I went through a period where I was the only kid in my school, in my class that didn't have a bar mitzvah.  I remember that, I remember where, you know, we had, they had to--we had to do a report on the Bar Mitzvah thing.  And I didn't--I was excused because I was the only one that had no, no real bar mitzvah experience and the only one who didn't go to Hebrew school.  But I think it was good, the exposure, you know, to--and they'd, you know, there was a work ethic that was very obvious, and, and that was, you know, there was one thing that, you know all the students in that school had in common is that they, you know, they, you know, they strove to get great grades and to get ahead.  And it came from the home, obviously.  So my, my mom thought it was the place to be.
Speaker 1: And what did you think, think at that time?  Did you, did you feel like a fish out of water or did you sort of enjoy learning about another culture?
Speaker 2: I didn't feel like a fish out of water at all.  No, in fact, I was, you know, I was happy to get home at night or whenever, at the end of the day.  It wasn't, it wasn't a hardship, you know.  I took a subway and a bus.  And I, I still had all my, my neighborhood friends.  And my neighborhood was, you know, 110 percent black.  So, it was fine.  I, I don't remember feeling like there was any kind of a hardship.
Speaker 1: Well, what did you learn?  Did you learn or were there friendships that you developed there that, you know stayed with you or were your friends mainly from the neighborhood.
Speaker 2: I, I remember I had friends there and none of them stayed with me, none, none of those friendships lasted beyond a few years after.  One of my, one of my close friends in that school, my buddy, Sheldon Shapiro, went, actually went to Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania], you know, while I was there.  And soon after we matriculated into Penn State, we were totally estranged from each other.  And it was nothing--not anything negative.  It was just natural.  I don't even think I, you know, had another conversation with him after our freshman, after our first semester as a freshman.  It was a big school and so we just never ran into each other.
Story_ID: 9870
Speaker 1: What I'm trying to figure out is what was forming you as a young person, you know, what people or, you know, what events or anything that was, you know, sort of creating you as a person?
Speaker 2: Well, like I said, I (unclear) my, my home life was very much and my, you know, my neighborhood was a very, you know, kind of transitional, you know, kind of hard, kind of, you know, in those days what seemed--you know, as I look at hard, you know, at, at the danger that youth face these days, it seemed like what, you know, what I went through was, was minor, you know.  There were certain people that you avoid, certain areas that you avoid because you could get really hurt.  But it was never the threat or the fear of death.  And, you know, there were people that did drugs, drug addicts and so forth and you know, but it was, you know, much less of a extreme than it is now.  And I guess it's my family, my extended family.  I have, you know, like I said, I had an uncle that was a principal of a school, had a couple of uncles that were doctors.  My, you know, my oldest brother whose twelve years older than me, went, you know, I guess--let's see, if he left at eighteen, I was six, you know.  He went away to college.  He went to Arizona to go to college.  He was a musician.  My, the--my brother, Bill, whose eight years older, actually lived, you know, he went to Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania], but when he graduated from Penn State, he came back and lived at home while he went to medical school in Philadelphia.  So I was actually subjected to his, you know, four years of medical school and intern and residency.  So I was able to see how intense that is.  He actually also got married and his wife lived in the house, and it was like a two-bedroom house.  It was actually three bedrooms, one of them was kind of split.  So we were live, living in close, close quarters for a long time.
Story_ID: 9871
Speaker 1: I never went on vacation.  I remember, remember spending summers kind of whiling the days away because there were, we didn't--I went to camp once one year.  I went to a camp when I was about, probably ten or eleven for a few weeks, Camp Emblem.  I had a good time at camp, but usually summers were long.  I was always (unclear), you know, happy when school came, you know, when it was time to go back to school.  We, I had, I had a cousin, a uncle and a aunt that lived in New Jersey, about an hour from, from where we lived.  And that was probably the closes thing to the country, even though it was a small town.  It wasn't really the country.  They had a big yard.  And so I would oftentimes--there were a couple of years in a row, I'd spend a couple of weeks with them.  But it was like a stone's throw from the house, but--and actually, my grandmother lived there and my mother's sister lived there.  And her husband was kind of neighborhood--a little community doctor.  He actually--his office was at the house.  So he had patients coming and going--
Story_ID: 9872
Speaker 1: --lifeguard or there were, let me see, fish, shark, junior lifesaver.  That was it.  (Unclear) Whatever the top position in swimming was, you know, we had to go through these tests, and go dive down and pull up some, you know, big heavy brick and that kind of thing, pull somebody out of the pool.  I would, you know, do those things.  I was athletic in a kind of a normal way.  Could run, jump and throw.
Speaker 2: Were you a, a Boy Scout ever?
Speaker 1: Yes, I was a, I think I was a Cub Scout.  I wasn't much in, into that stuff.  I remember I went, I went to one--I think I was a boy scout because I went to a thing called Jamboree or Jamborall or something.  And I hated sleeping on the ground so much that I never wanted to go back.  That was miserable.  The ground was hard, and I was just--it wasn't me.  I'm a city boy.
Speaker 2: Any interest in music?
Speaker 1: I always had an interest in music, yes.  But as a, as a--as listener.
Speaker 2: Any favorite entertainers during your youth?
Speaker 1: I grew up as very much, you know, as a--musically, R&B was the thing that, you know, kind of drove my existence, you know.  But it was early R&B.  It's funny I saw the, on the 'Soul Train' last night--Soul Train Awards, I saw James Brown get his award.  I used to go see him at the Uptown Theater [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] in his early, early days.  And then the Isley  [Brothers], Ronnie Isley was there who happens to be a friend of mine now.  And I remember listening to the Isley Brothers as a real young kid.  And people like Jerry Butler, the Spaniels and the Channels and, you know, there was--you know, I had, I had this little stack of forty-five records.  And they were, they were very important for me and my friends.  We were big into what was essentially R&B.  We called it Rock and Roll at the time, but it--
Story_ID: 9873
Speaker 1: Where's the creativity coming in at this point--you know, except that you said you liked to day dream.
Speaker 2: Where does it come in?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You mean where did it come from?
Speaker 1: Yeah, where did it come from?
Speaker 2: From God.  (Laughter)
Speaker 1: (Unclear) the early signs of it.
Speaker 2: Hey, well, I'm not sure.  I never tried to analyze where, where my creativity came from.  I actually haven't.  That's very interesting that you say that.  Where did the creativity come from?  I believe that creative people have a gift, and I'm not a very religious person, and, you know, I have many, many creative friends from all walks of life and from all kind, kinds of backgrounds.  So I believe that I'm--I believe that all, you know, all of those things that we talk about, you know, the music that I listened to, the, the days, the nights that I sat in, by that window and, and daydreamed about, you know, just hoping that the next person that change, turns the corner was my Mom.  And riding on that subway to that school where I was, you know, where, you know, all the, all the other students were Jewish.  I don't know.  I just think that there were, there was this--and I read a lot.  What makes it, makes me be able to, you know, direct plays and TV shows and command the respect of people around me creatively, I think it's something that I've always had.  And what I, when I, when I hung out with my friends, I was kind of the guy that kind of pushed the group in certain directions, kind of the leader, the director, if you will.  I, I think I had a lot of influence on people around me.  I think that I accepted that role and I created that role for myself.  And, you know, I was the one that was dir--you know, and whenever there was a vote about who should be in charge, it was, I won, hands down.  I could have been, I could have been the president of the student body easily.  I was, I was rushed by people to, to run and I just, I chose not to because I didn't want to--I thought it was corny and a waste of time.  I was voted most likely to succeed, and--in high school.  And so I, you know, I--but all of those things, I don't where they came from.  I think it's just, you know, it was natural for me.  But I still was pretty much, I wouldn't say a loner, but I still have, because I had a lot of friends cause I, you know, and, and hung out and did everything that teenagers do.  But I still had this kind of internal need to have my own, you know thoughts and I just had no problem being alone.
Story_ID: 9874
Speaker 1: --Well, there was Randy [Cain] and Donald and [William] 'Poogie' [Hart] , and I actually sang in a singing group in high school.  And that group was called the Veltones.  It later was changed to the Delfonics.  And actually, as I--and when we graduated from high school and, you know, and the group--and we, we performed around town.  We did a lot of, you know, we were, we were, we were pretty popular in the neighborhood and the neighborhood that we lived in was West Philadelphia.  And it was a part--a neighborhood in West Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] where Kenny Gamble, Tommy [Thom] Bell were our neigh--well, you know, were there.  They had a group called the Presidentials.  Len Barry, a white kid and his group called the Dovals.  Dee Dee, Dee Dee Sharp and Patti LaBelle and all of these, you know, it was this neighborhood that was like teaming with bands and groups and so forth.  I made the decision, I went away to college to Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania].  And I made the decision early on that this was what I was going to do because I wasn't that serious about the singing part.  I wasn't a lead singer.  And, you know, it's--and it was fun, but there was this, also this, this guy named Stan Watson who was kind of forcing himself on the group as a manager.  And he was a real local gangster.  He owned a couple of record stores, but he was just a, a bad guy.  And he put up some money to get the group some, some clothes and stuff like that and, you know, and pay for a couple of gigs or a couple of, you know, just invested money in the group and then, and then in doing so sort of assumed control of the group.  I went away to school.  Randy [Cain] also went away to school.  He stayed in school for a year, and then he went back to the group because now, they were really starting to get big.  And then somewhere, you know, a couple of years later they made "La La Means I Love You" and it was like the rest was, you know, this, this kind of joy ride to fame in their own, in that, in that context.  And I--never regretted form one second because Stan Watson was like taking all the money.  And even Poogie who wrote all the songs--in fact, they kind of wrote the songs together, but Poogie somehow got his name on them and Stan Watson got his name on them.  And it, you know, took, you know, years of, of--of legal battles later on to, for, for even Pougee to get his money.  Stan was buying horses and these guys were like getting paid, you know, $500 a piece for a gig.  And I think they all made $1,500 flat for the recording of "La La Means I love You".  So I said all of that to say, you know, it was--and I, I--it was, it was a very creative time, maybe even creativity came from just the exposure to all of those people.  But I think that my--I helped organize the group.  I helped kind of put it together, you know, made sure that we rehearsed on a regular schedule.  This is when we were fifteen or sixteen years old.
Speaker 2: Well, what made you decide to organize the group?
Speaker 1: Because we were, it was singing on--every corner had somebody singing on it.  And we had Poogie who was the best singer in the world at the time.  And, and it was like, it was more about finding a way to get Poogie out there and just to have enough harmony behind him for him to just blow everything away, you know.  I mean I'm not, I'm not saying it was--I, you know, but I was very involved in the, in getting the group together, named, you know.  I was the guy that settled the disputes and--but it wasn't, you know, I didn't, I didn't see myself--you know, we went to the, we went to the Uptown Theater all the time in Philly and the Uptown Theater was like the Apollo of Philly.  So we got to see all the group, you know, like I said, Isley Brothers, James Brown, Vibrations, Little Anthony and the Imperials, people like Mary Wells and even Gladys Knight and, you know, and the Pips when they were (unclear) kids.  And then the--in fact, most of the Motown groups came a little after I had already start--after I went to school in '64 [1964].  I went to, I started college in '64 [1964] and '65 [1965], '66 [1966]  is when the Motown explosion really took place.  I mean it had already started, but for it, when it became--I guess it was '64 [1964], '65 [1965], '66 [1966] that it all kind of really jumped out there.
Speaker 2: And the Philadelphia sound sort of came a little after that
Speaker 1: That came after that.
Speaker 2: After that, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  We were--like I said--
Speaker 2: But you were sort of at the beginning of it--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, we--before they named it the Philadelphia Sound.  That's essentially the difference.  Tommy Bell was a brilliant arranger.  You know, he's the one that, you know, kind of got this, you know, really perfected that thing with the strings in, in this music, you know.  And many of the, of the musicians in Philly, you know, actually ended up in, you know, in Detroit [Michigan], you know, and on the road with a lot of the, the Motown bands.  It's just that, you know, the whole Motown thing was way more organized (unclear) less disjointed.  You know, Berry bought all those groups together.  Had there been a Berry Gordy in Philly, then I'm sure there would have been a similar if not more exciting kind of--or even better.  We didn't have Smokey Robinson.  You know, there were two or three people in, in Detroit that were really seminal.  I mean Smokey was one, of course, and Stevie [Wonder] and a couple of the producers like Mickey Stevenson, and, you know.  Anyway, so music was very much a part of my background and my existence, that popular R&B.  And to this day, you know, I, I feel an affinity towards that whole period.
Story_ID: 9875
Speaker 1: So, now you went to Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania] because your brother had gone to Penn State?  Was that--what was the whole--
Speaker 2: I went to Penn State because my brother had gone to Penn State.  I went there because it was a state school.  I actually got accepted at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] and Lincoln University.  And I wanted to go to Howard, but couldn't--didn't get a scholarship, but I did get a scholarship to Penn State or at least--it's a little cloudy now.  But there was definitely an economic reason for Penn State being the absolute choice.  I kind of wanted to go there because it was a big university, and it seemed to be all those things that college is supposed to be, as Howard did to a certain extent also.  And I had a couple of friends that had already gone there, beside my brother, because it would, and it was the kind of school that, you know, I guess when you think of universities, and, you know, it was a college town.  I had visited it before when my brother was there.  So I was kind of familiar with it and I was always in awe of it.  So it was a pretty easy choice.  Definitely, it was, was going to cost me less to go there.  I had a partial scholarship, than I would at Howard, a lot less.
Speaker 1: Were you aware of like the social upheaval of the times or were you not really affected?
Speaker 2: No, of course, we all were, yes.  Absolutely.  '63 [1963], '64 [1964].  Yeah.  And, you know, my family was.  My bro, you know, my brothers, you know, my--we didn't--you know, we lived in a relatively--and I read papers, you know.  I was, you know, I was very aware of it.  And actually, that didn't have a lot to do with my decision to go to Penn State.  I do feel that I immediately and, you know, as, after I got there, you know, became more aware of all the political activity on campus.  I was kind of drawn toward that stuff.  And I got very much involved.  I, it's, it was part of, you know, being in school in the '60's [1960s].  If you weren't involved, you were like not in on all the really cool social stuff that was going around.
Speaker 1: Now, did you--yeah, someone, I can't remember.  Oh, someone recently told me so much stuff about the parties that happened during the '60's [1960s].  (Laughter)
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, no, the '60's [1960s] were cool.
Speaker 1: But when--how large was the black population there?  I know your brother and some friends of yours--
Speaker 2: Really, it was, I think there were 200 black students and there were 30,000 students, but that 200 was a very tight community.  We knew, we all knew each other.  There were other fraternities that were there.  So, you know, I, you know, I ended up becoming a Kappa.  In fact, I ended up as, you know, and as I said here earlier, you know, in that kind of leadership thing, I became Pole Mark in a year after I--a pole mark is a, well, I guess the head guy, very soon after I got in.  And then in my Junior year I kind of like, you know, sat it down and became less involved as I became more involved in, in film making and theater and stuff like that.
Speaker 1: So when you came, when you went into school, what were you thinking you were going to major in?
Speaker 2: I didn't know.
Speaker 1: So you--
Speaker 2: I knew I didn't want to go into medicine because I'd lived with my brother for four years, you know, through medical school.  I didn't like hospitals.  I didn't--and, you know, as I said, I wasn't good in--you know, I wasn't, I didn't have any kind of feeling about math and science that was that positive.  You know, there was a probably a tendency for people, for African American males to think about medicine and law.  A lot of my friends in school were business majors.  I never quite understood what a Business major was, even then, what they were going to do with it, you know.  And so I was open.  You know, I took a journalism course in my first as a freshman.  And--because I knew I liked to write.  I was, you know, I felt really good about writing.  And I thought well, maybe I'll major in English and, but I got a time to figure it out, and maybe I'll take this little journalism course.  And I took it, and there was a Professor there named Arthur Hungerford, who was probably the most influential person in my college years.  And luckily, I took a course with him like in my second semester.  And during the, halfway through the course, I changed my--I decided I wanted to major in journalism.  So I went through the, through the, whatever the administrative mess was to do that and Arthur Hungerford became my advisor because I, you know, requested him.  And then, then that relationship really turned into one that was very productive because not long after I got interested--long, long after I, you know, I started to map out my Journalism curriculum.  And the, in my first semester of sophomore year, I took a theater course.  Then I wanted to change to theater because now I realized that there was this whole world where I could express myself.  It kind of all came together.  And then I understood that, you know, that having the ability to, you know, to kind of create things.  And not being able to draw very well, and not really being about music, but there was a, you know, another means of, another outlet.  So I immediately--by the time I was, you know, halfway through my first semester as a sophomore, in fact, we were on a quarter system, my first quarter, it was about theater and it, you know, the Journalism was still there very much because, you know, I became interested in film and, and I became really, you know, very, very kind of driven in those directions, still trying to find the path.  I didn't know what I want to do is going to eventually be a film director and producer, but I was kind of fascinated by all of that stuff.
Story_ID: 9876
Speaker 1: Now, when you--with the theater class you took, what kind of class was it?  Was it a acting class or was it a scenes (unclear) or was it more theoretical?
Speaker 2: It was more theoretical.  It was like a, a theater, a history of theater kind of thing.
Speaker 1: And what, so what appealed to you about that?
Speaker 2: I was just amazed at, you know, what I learned.  I was just amazed that there, you know, that there was, you know, just what I'd learned.  I mean I--you know, we started with Greek theater and we worked our way up to the 20th Century and I was just fascinated at, you know, how it developed and--
Speaker 1: Now, you said you, you became interested in film, and I'm just wondering, is there a film program?
Speaker 2: Was there a film program?  There were film courses, yes.
Speaker 1: They had film courses.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So you took--
Speaker 2: I took their film class by the end of, you know, early on.  I, you know, it's all a blur right now.  It really is.  Sixty-seven.  I was also, you know, smoking a lot of weed, you know, and doing acid and stuff like so it kind of, sometimes I get, you know, mixed up.  That's part of the '60's [1960s], you know, that, that also went along with it.  So, yeah, I took a, I took a, I made a film as a kid, as a sophomore in, in high--in college.  I wish I could find that film.  And it was a strange little film which I shot and added to on a little, you know, really kind of rudimentary editing console.  But more importantly, I, at the end of my sophomore, with the help of Arthur Hungerford, I applied for an internship at KDKA in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] , which is a Westinghouse station.  And I was accepted.  So I spent my third semester at KDKA in Pittsburgh as a, a kind of an intern.  And it was a program that Westinghouse had put together.  It wasn't necessarily a minority program.  It wasn't a minority program at all, but somehow I managed to get in.  And it was their, what they called their management training program.  And so my days--it was, we spent, I spent time in each major departments, the sales department, production, you know, promotion, uh, and learned a lot.  And interviewed, you know, they had a couple of the Westinghouse big wigs--they were big wigs to me, maybe they were middle management guys, decided to offer me an internship at KYW in Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], which is my hometown, of course, and for the summer.  So I went straight from KDKA to Philadelphia in their, in their management training program.  And in Philly, I did the same thing, and I actually was the, 'Mike Douglas Show', I was on that for a while.  David Brenner, the great comedian, the famous comedian now, not great, he was not that good as a matter of fact, was a old reporter for KD--KYW News at the time, and I worked with him.  And, and actually, it was, right now, by the time, by the time that happened, we were right in the midst of the Black Power period.  And Stokely Carmichael was, you know, they were covering speeches of Stokely and SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] and that kind of stuff.  So for me it was a really intense experience, and it got me way interested in broadcasting and directing, you know, and making films, making documentaries and so forth.  And it allowed, you know, so again, and I stayed in touch with Westinghouse.  You know, they kind of kept their eye on me.  We, we corresponded.  They, they wanted to talk about thing, doing things, you know, aft, after graduation, getting back in the program.  But, you know, it was right in the middle of the, this whole Vietnam era, and the draft was raging.  In fact, many of my friends from Philly were being drafted.  I had a couple of friends that, I had one friend, a close friend, Skippy Milan, who we hung out one aft--one, one week and in the summer he was about to go away to, you know, he was about to leave.  He had been in, been through a little training.  He came home for a weekend and he was about to go, ship out to Vietnam.  And we got word that he got, he got killed in the airport, the day he arrived.  There was some of an attack, a guerilla attack on the airport that they arrived in.  And so he was like dead like three days later.  So it was a lot--you know, we had friends that we were hearing about wounded, dead.  So none of us really wanted to go into the, to the Service and didn't want to be drafted.  And there was the, the one out was graduate school.  So the way I got to Boston was I applied to, to BU [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts] in a program in a MFA Broadcasting, communications program that was a, it was a, a program that was, a work-study program with WGBH which is the local Boston Public station, a great station.  And as part of the program, I would be--had to spend half the time, have one--I'd spend one semester at the, at the studio.  And now I was being a little being a little bit more specific about production.  And one semester and at, you know, at BU at the college, and back and forth for two years.  So when I graduated from, from Penn State in '67 [1967], I went to, to, went directly to Boston and I spent the summer working at station, and it was amazing.  They were doing shows like the 'Julia Child Show'.  There were, you know, they already had NOVA and, and there were several other really cool shows that they did.  And, and, you know, and I was able to work on the crews and, you know, learn about the production, work in the offices and so forth.  It was a real work-study program.  And then in September when time came to go, you know, to the, to the school part of it, I realized, you know, that it was time for me--that school wasn't for me, you know, that--and I had already--I'd just graduated from four years of college.  And it was like, you know, this first couple of days, it was just overwhelming amount of work to be done and things that really didn't interest me any more.  So I, I dropped out, and I joined a theater company immediately.  It's kind of like watch, you know, I was kind of involved with this theater company when I just dropped out of school and went full time into this theater company.  And we put on a, a show called 'Riot' which was a kind of a experimental play based on the, the methods of the Polish Lab theater and the Café LaMama, you know.  It was very environmental, and it was very strong and very much a protest play that immediately became a sensation in Boston.  We did it in the Arlington Street Church basement and it was very successful.
Story_ID: 9877
Speaker 1: Okay, so, you know, I want to ask you though a little bit about KDKA and, what was the Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] station?
Speaker 2: KYW.
Speaker 1: KYW.
Speaker 2: They were the only two K's in the East cause they were the first two.
Speaker 1: Now, that was--I just want you to put things in historical context because we're still talking about, you know, the '60s [1960s].  You know, T.V. had started.  It's still sort of the early days of tel--I mean not the early, early days, but it's still--TV was still young.
Speaker 2: It was, yeah, absolutely.  TV was not only still young, it was, it was--it pre-dated color television.  We would just talk about color television.  This was '65 [1965].  I'm trying to remember what, whether it was--it must have been in the end of the, my, it must have been my sophomore and junior years that I was in those two places.  But anyway, it was--and that was in the winter--I know it was in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] in the winter.  It was a terrible winter.  And it was very interesting because in Pittsburgh, at the time, all the black men, young men my age were in, had been drafted.  All of them.  And I'm not even exaggerating.  It was, it was really strange.  So there were a lot of free black women around.  Not free in the (unclear) sense, but, you know, available I should say.  But, yeah, at KDKA there were--when I went to KDKA there were, and as I said, I was on a management training program, but it wasn't a minority program by any means.  It was just somehow with the help of the school and my little record, I got accepted.  And I remember it being awkward often when I was in the room, and that the only two people at that station was, it was one, one guy who was a, the guy that shined shoes literally.  And he'd shine shoes.  He had a stand and the other one was, you know, a maintenance guy.  And they were both so proud of me as was, you know, the woman that I rented a room from.  And I always remember there was this, this sense of--it was this kind of awkward thing.  I remember the sales guy used to take me his sale--would take me to like a lunch to, you know, when he'd meet with a client for lunch.  And even in the restaurant there would be, I'd look around, I'd be the only black person in the whole restaurant.  And because it was, you know, like the, in the dawn of the Civil Rights era, struggle--it wasn't really, I guess the struggle had begun, but right now it's sort of like '64, '65 [1964-1965].  Black Power was just kind of like exploding.  You know, we're hearing about the Black Panthers and [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.], of course, was a well-known figure by now.  The March on Washington had already happened.  But, so there was this kind of, you know, awareness on the part of the liberal whites, said, hey, it's cool, you know, there's a, you know, there's a negro in the room.  And sometimes I would just feel like, you know, that I shouldn't--you know, nobody wanted me there.  But I never had any, you know, real blatant exposure to anything, not that I can remember if I have it.  It might have happened and I wasn't aware of it or I might have suppressed it by now if there was any kind of real antagonism.
Speaker 1: Now, what experience were you getting?  I know you said the one program where you rotated between sales and promotion and--
Speaker 2: And production.
Speaker 1: And production, okay.  Were there things that you learned during, you know, in the, in the Westinghouse environment that has sort of stayed with you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --Can you talk (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: You know.  Absolutely, I learned about, you know, the structure of television, the structure of commercial television, which many people don't understand of how important sales is, how important it is.  You know, how much the, the advertisers themselves have, how much influence they actually have over what goes on the air and how ultimately, you come to realize that, you know, in the most extreme sense, the shows that we watch on television exists to fill up the time between the commercials, and that, you know, the, the role of a good general manager is to, is to sell as much, you know, is to make money for the station.  And you do that by trying to get the best, you know, best, best rates for the, for the advertising dollars.  And you, and you do that by somehow coming up with programming that attracts those, you know, attracts the audience that these folks want to reach.  So I would say that I learned a lot about the structure of television, about the thrust of television, about the priorities that exists in the business of television.  You know, I learned a lot about the, about production and about ways to do it on budget.  I learned the importance of budgets and of sticking to the budget.  You know, anything we do has to be done in a context of, you know, what are we trying to, what are we trying to achieve here and what are our resources for achieving it.  So it was good for that and most gross commercial sense because is a, you know, local T.V. station.  It was a network affiliate.  I think it was CBS so, you know, I learned a little bit about the relationship between the affiliates from the affiliate point-of-view and the network.  And then at KYW, it was the same--it was a little more of the same only that was a station that had a bigger profile because of the 'Mike Douglas Show' which was a national show produced at that station.  It was a daily show.  The producer, as a matter of fact, was Roger Ailes who is now infamous in right-wing Republican, what is he on now, anyway huge.  And then the experience in Boston, of course, at WGBH which is a public station affiliated with National Educational Television at the time which predated PBS, was, also was, you know, totally different because, you know, in the midst of intellectual liberals as opposed to, you know, a different kind of broadcaster whose about making the money, you know, about seeing the money.  And this is more of a people who are going out after grants and producing shows that, you know, having a, you know, really kind of snobbish attitude toward commercial television and in many ways producing shows that are just as, you know, that are sort of esoteric and kind of removed from the experiences of the audience if the audience is very small.  So I got a little bit of both.
Story_ID: 9878
Speaker 1: Did you like your PBS [Public Broadcasting System] experience?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  I thought it was great.  I felt like--there I felt, you know, there were more black people in the station.  There were, you know, it was already in front of the curve as far as embracing some of the results of, you know, the Civil Rights efforts.  And there were, there were, as I said, there were more black people.  It was in my, in my story of my path, I, you know, in my freshman year at BU [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts], I decided to leave school and, to--and by doing that I was forfeiting my WGBH gig.  Yeah, because it was part of the work-study program.  And so that's why I joined the theater company.  And we were doing this radical play that it was very successful and eventually, as the director went on to direct another play, I became the director.  So I was having this intense artistic, theatrical experience, worrying a lot about the draft because now my, my, my eligibility was in question.  And in March of '68 [1968], [Dr,] Martin Luther King [Jr.] was assassinated.  And it happened one night while we were, you know, while we were in the middle of our show.  You know, we got the word and afterwards, you know, there was a, this really kind of--because the show was all about that, and we had to immediately start to make changes to deal with that.  And then the next day, I got a call from WGBH.  And they were, and they had decided in an extreme measure that they wanted to somehow try to stop the riots that were going to happen.  And, you know, they knew they would come in the summertime.  And so they decided the only way to do that would be to have a, you know, an African--a black show aimed at the black community.  You know, so the people could have their own T.V. show.  So they called me in as a director.  They had a--there was an audio guy there, a black audio guy who they gave a producer credit to.  His name was Andrew Ferguson.  And then Ray Richardson who was a student at BU, but also, you know, was--he was very bright and had been involved. They hired him as the producer.  We immediately started.  And, and there was this big flack with, with [W]GBH, said, no, you can't hire him because he left.  And what kind of message are you sending to the other, not with GBH, with, with BU.  You know, what kind of message are you sending to the other interns.  In fact, one of the other interns actually, you know, complained.  You know, we got to go through school, and now he's got a job at the station, getting paid.  So they, they, you know, they quickly squashed that and in June of '68 [1968] we came along with a show called 'Say Brother', which I was the director and that's all I've done since, is direct.  And that's how that, that started.
Story_ID: 9879
Speaker 1: Now, I want to--the theater company that you talked about, what was the name of it?  You never gave the name.
Speaker 2: It was called 'Ohm Theater Workshop'.
Speaker 1: And who started that?
Speaker 2: It was a woman named Julie Portman who was the artistic director of the, and she had studied with Polish Lab[oratory Theatre], which is [Jerzy] Grotowski and--
Speaker 1: Can you talk about--I studied Grotowski one time--
Speaker 2: You did?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I did.  I'm a theater person.  But--yeah, I mean I studied it in school.  But, you know, can you talk about it, that a little bit.  I mean and was she--it wasn't a black--was it a mixed company?  Or was it?
Speaker 2: It was a very mixed company, but she was not, she was not black.  She was a Jewish woman.  And she was the most dedicated theater person I've ever met.  In fact, it was her passion--I met her at a party.  And she, you know, we got into a conversation.  And she told me about this, this thing that she was doing, this company she was putting together, and asked me to come check it out.  And I came and I went one day and, you know, there were, there were about ten people in there.  And four of them were black.  And she asked me to join the class and you know, we started out by doing stretches and, and essentially kind of a Yoga thing.  And then, you know, and relaxation exercises and I was so blown away by the relaxation exercises because by the time it was over, I was actually relaxed.  I was actually kind of in touch with myself.  I mean, you know, the whole effort to, you know, to kind of communicate with one's self and to go inside.  It happened real quick for me or at least that day I, you know, I felt like it was possible.  So I became involved and eventually, you know, I learned techniques there that I've used to this day in terms of just being able to meditate and tune out, tune in, those kind of things.  And we, we did a lot of theater exercises and, you know, and theater games and things like that.  And we started working on, gradually on some of the--actually what she did was, she actually cut out a lot of images from magazines of, of protests.  And we actually would, would work, you know, would, would take an image and it was, be something really graphic like a kid on the ground dead, you know, or, you know, the, the spraying of the hoses on the--that we all remember, on the crowds of people.  And we would somehow improv around that.  And so this, this piece kind of grew out of it.  The piece was called 'Riot'. And I was fascinated.  I was really inspired by that experience and by the experience with her.  And it sort of colored everything that I did afterwards in terms of the way I approached work and the way I, you know, even now when I, when I prepare I think I kind of have the ability to kind of go inside a little bit more, go inside the subject matter, rather than just do surface kind of preparation.  And, you know, at first it was a part-time experience, but then I got so into it, and I got so turned off by the, the idea of studying more communications theory that I left school and went there full time.  I mean we--and started with her full time.  And as I said, kind of assisting her in learning a lot about the kind of her sharing her knowledge of theater, which was kind of unconventional.
Speaker 1: Where had she trained--'cause essentially you were, you were receiving classical theater training in many ways with, with some new techniques.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, she worked in New York a lot.  She had worked with Cafe La Ma Ma [Repertory Company, New York, New York].  In fact, I'm trying to remember the woman's name that ran that. And she had been around, you know.  She had been, you know, (unclear).  She--I remember--you know, there were things that she said to me as a director that I hear myself saying today to other actors.  Well, just--it was, it's hard to, you know, to, to actually--but there's, you know, there's things about the presence on stage and presence in front of the camera that, you know, I think she's the first one that got me to understand about, you know, you know, working in the moment.  And about, you know, how body language is so important.  And well I, I interpret it as body language, but just, you know, the way you carry yourself, sends a lot of messages.  So I use those in real life as well as, you know, on stage with actors.
Speaker 1: So did she work a lot, did you work a lot with pantomime during that time?  Did you, did she--
Speaker 2: No, we didn't do a lot of pantomime though.
Speaker 1: Okay, but improvisational.
Speaker 2: Improv, improv, improv.  A lot of--and really unstructured improv.  It's like, it was, she was very much about, you know, kind of free-flowing stuff.
Speaker 1: So in many ways would you consider yourself street theater sort of?
Speaker 2: I think that what we, what we'd tried to create was street theater.  But like you said, there were classical, certainly classical and, and various, you know, kind of traditional, I should say, approaches to, you know, preparing ourselves as actors.
Story_ID: 9880
Speaker 1: 'Say Brother' is really well known.  I mean it's known and the whole PBS [Public Broadcasting System], but were you given a clean slate?  You know, you said you were--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --put it on.  So what were you even prepared to do in terms of forming a show, but what were your--were you given any parameters?  What were you wanting to do, this, you know, (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: We had no parameters.  In fact, for the first two years we were totally unsupervised to the point where we had interviews with Bobby Seale and with, with Stokely [Carmichael] that were on the verge of being, you know, of getting the station in a lot of trouble.  In fact, we finally, the--I wish I could remember his name, the program manager of the station got us together at a meeting and said, "Look, you guys have to be more responsible.  There are two sides to every argument.  You know, when we, when they, when you bring on people that, that, you know, that accuse the government of, you know, very specific crimes and, you know, then we have to have some sort of, you know, some sort of, of other sides responding."  And we had a tendency to probably go over board with, with a lot of the political stuff.  We also had a lot, you know--one of the things that we, that we really wanted to do was, was try to get, try to take advantage of the, of the cultural artistic scene in town.  You know, so a lot, all the music, you know, we had Sly and the Family Stone.  We had, you know, we, you know, the, the Parliament [and], Funkadelics  [sic. Funkadelic], anybody that actually, you know, Archie Bell and Drells, anybody that played at the Sugar Shack in Boston [Massachusetts] did our show.  And they were always bringing groups in and out.  Plus, we had anybody that did, people like Ravi Shankar and anybody that did concerts for Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] or for, BU [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts] or any one of the thousands of colleges in that area, we, you know, we went after.  And we did theater pieces.  We did and we did a lot of political reporting on the local Boston scene.  In fact, Henry Hampton, who I'm sure you know, was one of our correspondents.  And he, you know, he did a weekly interview with someone.
Speaker 1: Well, and that--how did, how did the title come up?  Who, who came up with the title?  (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I, I remember, yeah, I remember having long discussions about the title.  But I'm trying to remember--I don't remember the other titles that we thought about.
Speaker 1: But what was clear is that being in Boston with all those schools sort of helped and having that clean slate helped.
Speaker 2: Absolutely--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  The clean slate was, was what was great.  We--it was ours to, to mess up.  And we had a lot of, you know, bungles.  But you know what happened, you know the tragic thing is that Alma Lewis convinced WGBH to let her store the masters and their place burned down and all the masters of the first two years of that show were destroyed in that fire.  Masters.  So the most exciting stuff is gone.  The really historic stuff is gone.  All of those same interviews I told you about.  I left two years later.  I left in '69 [1969] because by then the show was well known, and I was the only black director known to mankind.  It was, you know, there was one in, in L.A [Los Angeles, California].--I forget his name.  He's, he's deceased now, but I got a call from Bill Greaves who was producer of a show called 'Black Journal'.  And he came up to Boston and we met, and he was prepared to double my salary from, I think $250 to $500 a week.  And at the same time--and, you know, and I was willing to do it, and at the same time that he came, a week later before I had even got to move, I got a call from Children's Television Workshop, the producers of 'Sesame Street', also willing to offer me a job as a director because they were getting--now they were on a point where they we getting flack.  This was '68 [1968] now or late '68--I'm sorry '69 [1969], '69 [1969].  This was '69 [1969], in mid-'69, and they were getting flack about not having enough minority activity behind the camera.  So they called because John Stone was the producer of the show.  And, and I said, "Well, you know, I'm about to come to New York anyway and, because I'm going to do 'Black Journal'."  So he said, "Well, look, maybe you can just come in, you know, on a part-time basis, just direct, you know, a show once a day, once, once a week or so rather than just be here full time."  So I worked it out with 'Black Journal' and with, and with, with CTW that I would, you know, I would do--I would, on a, on a semi-regular basis, I would go in and do a couple, you know, their shows.  And I would work as a producer.  I was a, you know, kind of a film producer-director, I mean when we made documentaries for 'Black Journal'.  I wasn't yet their studio director, and the only thing the studio director did was kind of put the show together.  And that kind of worked--it worked cool.  It was really good.  So I got a chance to work at both worlds.  But I'd say four months after I got there then the Ellis [B.] Haizlip called me.  Ellis Haizlip that was the producer of a show called 'Soul' for W[NET]--for Channel 13 and said, look, we shoot on the weekends.  You know, and I know you shoot music and, you know, and you shoot, you know, tape.  So, you know, I just need you to come in and shoot the live show on the, shoot the show live on the weekends.  So there was a point where I was doing all three shows.  And, you know, right around the beginning of 1970, I was, you know, twenty-five and just, you know, at the top of my game and living in New York City.  It was pretty, it was pretty intensely rewarding and gratifying.  I was making money.  So it was cool.  I mean and I got--not only did I get to work with, you know, some of the--when I did, when I did the documentaries for 'Black Journal', I shot a film on Maxwell June, Abbey Lincoln who at the time were together.  And it was very amazing to shoot film.  I have traveled to Trinidad and shot a film on Carnival, two films, one on Carnival and one on the phenomenon of, of steel, steel drums and steel bands, and traveled to Guiana and did a, did a film with Forbes Burnham who was the Prime Minster at the time and whole, the whole question of nationalism and imperialism and how they kind of were clashing right in the middle of that, of that period of time.  And I worked with, you know, Amiri Baraka and, and Ed Bullins and, you know, and had, you know, did a lot of, a lot of cultural things for the show.  But at the same time on Soul, I got to work with everybody.  I mean and we, Ellis was, you know, was really amazing at bringing in, you know, everybody from Ashford and Simpson to Carmen McCrae and from Miriam Makeba to people like Tito Puenté, Willie Colon and Stevie Wonder, Earth, Wind & Fire and it was just so--I, I got a lot of response then and a lot of, you know, a lot of exposure to really talented people.  And it kind of really helped me establish some sort of sense of--I think maybe then I started to realize that I could probably really do just about anything I wanted to do as a director.
Story_ID: 9881
Speaker 1: Can I ask you at what point, because at the point, you know, that you were at 'Say Brother', you said you had some bungles, but I'm wondering directorially, as a director, when you sort of found your voice, you know, or your, or your style, your directorial style?  Or did it take, you know, really the New York [New York] experience for you to find that?  I'm just--
Speaker 2: I think I, I think I realized--I think I started to think like a director somewhere in Boston [Massachusetts], and probably during the experience with the, with the theater company because there was a point where I became, actually became the director of the company.  And there's no question that the intensity of the experience in putting the show together called 'Say Brother', and working on it for two years every week, having to turn out a show and do a, trying to do a little bit of everything, helped me establish certainly a sense of the need to complete.  You know when you've got a show that goes on every Thursday at 8:30, there's a, you know, you start to respect deadlines.  We weren't as worried about budgets at the time because we sort of had the resources of the whole, whole studio, the whole, the whole station.  But we certainly, we, you know, realized and participated in an exercise of getting the show on the air and trying to, trying to do it as, with as much flare as possible.  So I watched a lot of television, and I, you know, and I was inspired by directors like Dwight Haymein (ph.)--Dwight Haymein I remember well because he was a director of musicals or, or variety shows.  There was a director named Kirk Browning.  Actually, during my time at [W]GBH I was able to, to assist two directors.  One was Kirk Browning in his direction of the, of an Alvin Ailey special.  So I, then I met Alvin and, and we became friends.  And I met Judy [Judith] Jamison and all of the, you know, the dancers there.  I got a chance to direct a show for a series called "On Being Black," which was a series of dramas.  And I also got a chance to assist on a couple with great directors.
Story_ID: 9882
Speaker 1: And I think it comes from doing it and watching it and the next time you do it, you do it a little different.  Doing it, getting feedback from people and the next time you do it, even if you don't agree with the feedback, it certainly affects the way you approach it.  And, and also getting, you know, advice.  One of the things that happened with me is, you know, I told that in the '70s [1970s], I mean in the early--in 1970 I was doing these three amazing things for PBS.  Well, I think probably much, you know, for a great reason--I mean for, one of the main reasons I started getting more calls is because I was black, but I think that also I was doing work that was, you know, really kind of cool.  So, I got--I started, I became the kind of go-to guy at PBS for certainly anything culturally black.  For instance, Ellis [B. Haizlip] produced a major special called 'Alvin Ailey Memories and Visions' and I got to direct it.  And so that three years after I worked, worked with him as an assistant to a director in Boston [Massachusetts], you know, I got to direct their, their--which is one of their major series and you still see clips from it.  It also was the, was the show that got WGBH, I mean got WNET their grant for the 'Dance in America' series.  It kind was the flagship show for the 'Dance in America' series.  I also started doing a series for, in, in Washington [D.C.] at a place called Wolf Trap, called In 'Performers at Wolf Trap'.  And then I got to work with Martha Graham and [Mikhail] Baryshnikov and, and the [Moshe] Paranovs and so I started to develop this reputation, thanks to the Alvin Ailey experience, for being a dance director.  I later went to Canada to do a show with Agnes DeMille, with the World Winnipeg Ballet and did a lot of dance.  And once again, as along the way, I developed sort of a, you know, my own way of shooting dance.  And it's hard to talk about how that differs from anything else.
Speaker 2: But can you talk about your way of shooting dance?
Speaker 1: As I see it.  I mean it's hard to put it in words.  You know, when, you know--
Speaker 2: But dance has a, you know, every--it has a rhythm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But, you know, but different dances, you know, require a different approach.  I just feel I have an affinity for dance.  And I feel like in any given point where I put the camera is, you know, I try not to, with classical dance like ballet and, you know, and the modern dance of Agnes and Agnes DeMille and Martha Graham, you know, it's--I try to make the camera as unobtrusive as possible.  I think that if you're aware of the camera, you're out of the experience.  So there I'll try to be very presentational.  I try to find the, I try to find the actual essence of what, what is going on.  And, you know, I usually stay, you know, kind of stay wide and that kind of thing.  With--so a lot of the hip-hop type stuff, you know, it's a different thing.  They, it calls for more involvement on the part of the camera, otherwise, it starts to--because I think we're forced to do that because of the MTV experience.  People kind of expect the visual treatment to be as frenetic as the, as the work itself.  And so kind of reluctantly I'm, you know, I have a tendency to really resist putting my own spin on what's happening and trying to--and I also resist trying to decide what the audience should be looking at.  You know, and when you walk on stage, you look at whatever it is that attracts you, but I mean when it's being shot, it's different.  So I have a, you know, I guess I have a, sort of an esthetic that, that dictates how I approach something.  And even when I have to go against it, then I, you know, I feel like it still comes to play because at least I know that I'm going against it, you know.  When I, when I came to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] in '74 [1974], my first--I guess to came to L.A., the first time I came to L.A. was in '71 [1971].  I was doing a, when I was producing a documentary for 'Black Journal', on the Soledad Brothers, and we shot and, and it's called 'Justice?' with an, with a question mark.  When we shot in San Quentin [Prison, San Quentin, California] and interviewed a lot of the political figures including, you know, all of the Civil Rights lawyers that, that dealt with, or, or the, the lawyers that had dealt with Jonathan Jackson and, and George Jackson and Angela Davis and all of the prevailing political figures of the time.  And I kind of liked L.A. a lot at the time.  And then--but I had so much stuff back East, and it was, wasn't in the plans until in '74 [1974] I got a call from, that same call from someone looking for the black director.  And it was Aaron Reuben who was the producer of 'Sanford and Son' because Redd Foxx had decided that, you know, he needed to have a black director.  He needed, and once again, a, really, they had very few that they could choose from.  And they didn't want just one guy.  So they called me.  They heard about me, and they called me.  And they said, "Stan, you know, we, you know, we've seen some of your work, and we think you should be out here, you know, working with us."  This was even after 'Save the Children', which we could talk about--or we'll go back and talk about.  So I went out there.  I came out here in '74 [1974] and directed one episode.  And they liked me, and I came back and did six more.  And then I got to work, not only with Redd [Foxx], who was a great inspiration to me.  He, you know, we'd--you know, he took to me immediately, and kind of took me under his wing and, and I went to, you know, to see all of his shows in [Las] Vegas [Nevada] and wherever he was.  I was, I was, you know, I had just, my, my--I, I can't explain how important my relationship with him was for the short time that, that we were together.  And then Aaron Reuben, who was the producer of the show, was also a veteran producer, writer from, go back to the 'I Love Lucy', to the early days of 'I Love Lucy', which at the time was twenty years already.  And he was also a great influence.  He was the one that taught me to keep it simple in comedy, just, you know, just let it, let it take its own--if it's funny, you know, then get out of the way.  And that's kind of followed me through, through life, you know, keep it simple.  Just, I mean my--if, if anything, my directing style is minimalist in terms of the use of the camera.
Story_ID: 9883
Speaker 1: One thing that sort of strikes me is that it's, it appears that black people have had a great deal to, you know, influence in your career.  And I think about, would you have stayed in Boston [Massachusetts] had Bill Green not, you know--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --contact--you would not have been in Boston?
Speaker 2: No, I was--
Speaker 1: So you were going to leave at that point?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  But, but, you know, no.  There's no way I would have stayed.  There were too many things--first of all, I'm in New York, I mean I--my brother, I mean New York was, was calling to me.  I would have ended up in New York very soon after that.  In fact, it's interesting because when I went back to WGBH, WGBH and kind of left the theater company in the lurch, it was very soon after that, that that play, Riot, actually played New York at the American Place Theater to relatively, you know, and that would have been my--I would have never left New York after that, by any means.  No, Boston was--I'd already outgrown Boston.  I was on a mission to like just do more.  But, you know, the, the experience at WGBH is what set me up as a TV director.  Probably, if that hadn't happened, I would have still gone to New York as a, you know, as a theater director and, you know, my, my life would have taken a whole other path, but I don't believe that it would have been any less successful in the long run.
Speaker 1: Well, I'm not going to take issue, but we won't go there.  I, I'm just saying--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, I don't, I don't think it would--
Speaker 1: What theatrical director can you name whose had your success and been able to--well, I'm just, you know. I mean know of black theatrical directors and I'm just wondering--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah. (interruption)(break in tape)
Speaker 1: But I'm just wondering what theatrical director, but we won't (unclear) for that.  But what--I mean we're talking about the same period of time, you know, that has existed from like, you know, the late '60's [1960s] till now.
Speaker 2: And maybe you're right.  Maybe I would, you know, maybe I would just be, you know, a multiple Tony [Award] wnner.  You know, rather than, you know, I probably would have gotten my first Tony in 1980, in 1975.
Story_ID: 9884
Speaker 1: You know, it's interesting because right during the period of time was the, the 'Melvin Van Peebles Show', and he was supposed to die a natural death.  And I was very, you know, I was very close in that, in that group.  I mean I ended up, my, Sanaan's mother, you know, I have a daughter, Sanaan, who's an actress, her mother was a dancer with, with Alvin [Ailey Dance Company] and, and then with George Faison and then ended up being, you know, a member of the, the original company of 'The Wiz' and 'Timbuktu' and all that.  And I was right up in there.  I'm telling you.  I would have been involved in that, all of that stuff because I was very intensely involved in the theater and I was kind of a go-to guy.  You know, I, I've never had a problem that I can ever remember, you know, stepping into the forefront of any given situation.  I've never been rejected.  I've been fired, but never been rejected (laughter) and only fired for being, you know, being, you know, too strong for, for the, for the circumstances around me.
Story_ID: 9885
Speaker 1: Now, Save the Children.  Why don't you talk about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we--I was--
Speaker 1: That was in 1973, right?
Speaker 2: It was in '73 [1973].  In '72 [1972], Matt Robinson, who was my lifelong friend--he was a little older than me.  In fact, he was my brother's age, but I was--I knew him since I was a kid because he and my brother were friends in Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  He was the first Gordon on Sesame Street.  In fact, when I went to do Sesame Street, he was still the guy.  In fact, he might have been the guy that told John Stone about me as being a director in Boston that he should check out.  I think that was the way it was or something.  Anyway, we were, we were close and we, and he, he was a brilliant writer and he was a performer.  And he came to me and said, "Look, I got this film I want to do called 'Amazing Grace', you know, and I want [Jackie] 'Moms' Mabley in it and I'd like you to direct it."  And I was, and I read the script, and I thought it was really kind of, like trite and not very good and not very funny.  But I said, "All right, okay," assuming it would never sell.  And then he called me back a week later and said, "They want to make the deal.  Can you shoot?  It's only a 4-week shoot.  Can you do it and," you know, and I figured out a time I could do it.  And we actually shot this film with Moms Mabley and Slappy White and Stepin Fetchit, also known as Lincoln Perry; Butterfly McQueen, and Rosalind Cash and Moses Gunn and--but it's a, it's really not a good film.  Only, and it was really--and the reason why is because Moms was so old and so ill that we couldn't really--that it was all about just getting her on camera.  She actually had a heart attack two weeks into production.  And we were, and I thought we were shutting down forever.  And her people kept saying, no, she really wants to do it.  She really wants to get this film in the can.  So we actually--she came back with a pacemaker.  And we had a, a stand-in who looked just like her who was the person that walked in and out of all the doors and, and we would actually get her close ups and she would still be in her, like a wheelchair.  Sometime we would stand her up and have people like holding her.  And she would do her lines.  And the only way she could do her lines because she had a--her memory was gone, is that the script supervisor would, would say the line and then she would repeat it in her own way.  It was brutal.  It was really excruciatingly tough and sad that we had to do it that way.  We finally got the film done, and they put it out.  And it was, you know, not a good film because--but for me there was, once again, it was another experience about, if, you know, can't control the situation, don't do it, you know.  But anyway Matt and I were editing that when, when Clarence Avon and Quincy Jones and [Rev.] Jesse Jackson [Sr.]--I'm trying to remember [John] Bustamante's first name, but there was, you know, there were sev--a group of people and we were called to a meeting in, somewhere in, in Newark [New Jersey], somebody's house.  I think it was Pete Long's house.  I don't know.  Pete Long was a, a man who worked at the Apollo [Theater, New York, New York] for many years.  He was like the stage manager at the Apollo.  And he knew all of these guys really well, and he was a--and we met.  And we talked about this project that Clarence and Jesse wanted to do of, of shooting the PUSH [People United to Save Humanity] Expo, which was coming up, and they were trying to make it a real big deal.  It was already a big deal.  They had a lot of people committed to coming in.  They thought it should be shot on film, and there was this quick effort to put together the money to shoot it.  Matt was asked to produce it and I was asked to direct it.  And it was very exciting.  And we--I remember the meeting well, and I remember this world wind of activity trying to put together a crew, wanted to put together a black crew.  So out of the eleven cameramen, nine of them were African Americans.  We had a big, you know, kind of a tussle with the union in Chicago [Illinois] at the--
Speaker 1: Was it McCormick Place [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You were at some hall.
Speaker 2: No, we were down near the Stockyards.
Speaker 1: Stock--were you--
Speaker 2: Huge.
Speaker 1: Amphitheater.
Speaker 2: Amphitheater?
Speaker 1: Amphitheater.  Is that it?  Is that at the stockyards?
Speaker 2: Yeah, where you walk out and you see the tracks and everything, yeah.
Speaker 1: That was the Amphitheater.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that.  And because none of the cameramen, of course, were union.  And we had a big fight over that.  We ended up paying them off, of course, after they pulled the plug on the electricity on the first night, just before the show.  The whole place goes black and, you know, it was that kind of thing.  So, it was great.  It was a great experience and for me it was, it was the most intense experience I had had to date.  And there, once again, I was like thrust into the middle of all of these major people.
Speaker 1: Now, would you--
Speaker 2: And if you saw the film, you saw the, you know, the people that were there.
Speaker 1: Right.  Well, how much planning time was, did you have for that?
Speaker 2: Oh, a couple of months.
Speaker 1: And who raised the money?
Speaker 2: The money was raised--
Speaker 1: They raised $750,000.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was a grant from Ford Foundation.  And so I don't remember--you know, there was a, there was a African American Executive at the Ford Foundation--Clarence knows those guys' names.  I don't, I don't remember their names.  There was a lawyer named [John] Bustamanté that was, that worked for PUSH who somehow put together this, this non-profit arm that could get the grant.  There was a lot of manipulation there to hurry up and get this money in, which eventually came back to haunt us because it had a lot to do with the ability to release the film and, you know, the, the rights of, you know, all the material that was in it and that kind of thing.  So, and the, the sad thing about that also was that Paramount in their gross kind of effort and need to make a profit or at least to make it pay for itself or whatever they acquired it for, actually hired somebody to come in and cut out all the political material.  And they re-released in the south as a film called 'Brothers and Sisters in Concert' and they cut out everything but the music.  In fact, when you look on, on databases, you'll see 'Save the Children/Brothers and Sisters in Concert'.  If you see the 'Brothers and Sisters in Concert', that means that it's the raped film, not the original.  And as far as we know, it, Jesse's [Jackson Sr.] wife has a copy of the film.  When you saw it, what did you see, a tape?
Speaker 1: I saw a tape.
Speaker 2: That's the tape--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sutley (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, I got him that tape.  So--
Speaker 1: You know, you, you said it was one of your most intense experiences to date.  You shot over three days, right?
Speaker 2: And, and you didn't--was all, were all the cameras (unclear) still with it.  Were they--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Because I read something about you positioning yourself in a place and having communications--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I had communications with the cameramen, but I couldn't see what they were doing.  So.  It was, you know, it was good.  I mean for that part of it was not as--it was just intense.  It was just, you know, never stopped.  And I'd shot things like that before.  I'd shot, you know, in many documentaries, were always very, you know, it's always intense, you know, because it's just--but, in this case, it was overwhelming.  And we came up with an extraordinary film, it was just, Paramount [Pictures]--didn't know what to do with it, and it just kind of died in, in the way it was marketed and distributed.
Story_ID: 9886
Speaker 1: You said you got the call from this, from Aaron Reuben, when you got the call to come out here.  Had you been a fan of Redd Foxx any more than, you know, through the average person out here?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, Redd Foxx was already a hero.  We had been listening to his records, laugh records, you know,  Yeah, no, we, Red, Red Foxx was big for us.  For me he was big.  I mean it's already, by then, now, I'm, you know, I'm, I'd just done a film with Moms Mabley and Slappy White and, and, you know, and Lincoln Perry.  We were all, you know, they were all--Redd was--Slappy was Redd's side man.  So, no, I got to know him really well.  I mean and I, you know, he--I was very aware of him.  We were all very aware of him.  He was kind of the leading guy in, on the, to the, prior to [Richard] Pryor who I eventually, you know, worked with.  And I ended up working with, you know, all--I worked with, I did a special with Flip Wilson, you know, worked on the Pryor film and we, you know, we worked on a couple of projects together that didn't get off the ground.  I got to work with a lot of comedians in my day.
Speaker 1: Can we--going back to the Redd Foxx Show, the--I mean Sanford & Son, not the Redd Foxx Show, 'Sanford and Son' because this was a show that was very--that hit a nerve with the black community.  And some--I had read some place that he felt constrained a little bit, you know, that he found the show constraining.  Is that not true?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was very, he was very uncomfortable in that show.  First all, he, you know, he'd spent the first forty years of his career working in beer gardens, you know, getting up at, you know, showing up at 9:00 o'clock for work and then, you know, doing the job and working, and hanging out all night.  And then getting up at, you know, 2 o'clock in the afternoon or, you know, and going to the racetrack or whatever.  You know, he was like, it was a pretty easy life for him, not easy.  I shouldn't say that.  It was pretty specifically different kind of life from having to be at a rehearsal five days a week at 10 o'clock [a.m.] and then rehearsing, rehearsing, rehearsing, rehearsing and then not getting to actually perform until the Friday of that week.  He had very little discipline in that process.  You know, he got, he got bored with the jokes.  You know, by the end of the first day, he was bored with the jokes because you want to tell the jokes, you don't want to rehearse them.  So it was oftentimes in the rehearsal process that he wouldn't really rehearse the jokes.  So he wouldn't get bored with them.  And many times it would really throw guest stars who would finally get on camera and a different Redd Foxx would show up, kind of blow them away, you know.  But he didn't like the rehearsal process.  I don't think he liked the, the environment with the, with, you know, the people that he had to answer to the writers and the producers.  The censors, the, you know, the NBC standards and practices, who were constantly, you know, questioning, you know, intent on the kinds of things that he did.  You know, he was famous for years to be, for being blue, as they say.  And that was his thing.  He was a blue comic and one of the first--well, maybe not one of the first, but certainly one of the most famous.  And so it was a big adjustment for him.  And the only thing that really made it possible for him was the overwhelming success and wealth that came along with it.  And I think that that, you know, made it kind of worth his while to buckle down and do what he had to do.  Not only did he make a great living as a television performer, but his [Las] Vegas [Nevada] stakes went up tremendously.  And, and he would leave after his show on a Friday night and go to Vegas for the weekend and make a fortune.  He was very successful.  You know, he had his, he eventually had his tax woes.  And I don't know how he actually really ended up, but he wasn't--for a while there he was living the high life, the highest of it, of the high life.
Speaker 1: Now, so this--that show catapulted both of you in many ways, right?  I mean you had already had your thing, but this was a different thing in L.A. [Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2: It was a different.  I opened up the door in sense to, to television, to mainstream television.
Story_ID: 9887
Speaker 1: But you wanted to do that, to the, at that point.  You know, if Aaron Reuben hadn't come calling, were you getting--I mean you were saying that, you know, I really liked doing dance, you know, that was sort of my, you know, strong point (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I liked doing dance and I, I was probably really more looking forward to, you know, doing more feature films.  I--but I was, you know, I was--I was already--(clears throat) Excuse me, I'm sorry.  By the time we got to '60 [1960], I mean to '74 [1974], I had already had, you know, a seven-year career in television, and as a television director.  And at the time, for somebody who was, you know, twenty-eight, that wasn't bad.  And so now I'm, you know, off to Hollywood to do, you know, a network, network TV show, and that being my favorite, everybody's favorite, that was really cool.  And then it led to, you know, right after that I got, I started doing 'Barney Miller' and 'That's My Mama' and the shows that came along after that, it was funny, because people would be surprised that I was black because even having done black shows was, it was a lot for black directors to be around.  So I'd walk into a room for an interview, and they would, they would be shocked.  This went on for the next fifteen years.
Speaker 1: And how were you able to do--how were you able to avoid being slotted?  Was it because Aaron Reuben had chosen you to begin with or--I'm just--
Speaker 2: Slotted, what do you mean?
Speaker 1: I mean not--I'm sorry, not being, you know, put just as a black director?
Speaker 2: Well, because there wasn't any reason to do it in television.  There weren't that many black shows.  There were a couple.  I mean there were even a few, but--
Speaker 1: But I mean why weren't you just, you know--I'm just--I understand that.  But I'm just saying that sometimes people get--and they, they only employed after 'Sanford and Son' may have been--no matter how good you were, you may have just gone by the wayside.  I'm ask--I'm asking why?
Speaker 2: Well, once again, I, I don't think that I'm--I'm not the guy that's going to go by the wayside.  I just think that it's part of, you know, my, my ability to give the people what they want at any stage of the game.  I don't ever, I've never worried about going by the wayside to this day.  When I go by the wayside, it's going to be because I stepped to the wayside, not because I was driven there.  And it's just, you know, it's just part of, you know, what, and my, you know, what drives me.  It's the, you know, the knowledge that I'm, you know, that I don't bullshit, I deliver, you know.  I've never had to, you know, I've, I've never been given anything because of any other reason than I deliver.  And, you know, the folks that I've worked with, my partners, my employers--but I haven't had many employers over the last few years, but I've had some.  You know, it's, it's, you know, it's like I say, you're kind of a go-to guy.  You want to get it done.  So, and I'm not, you know, I'm not trying to brag or anything, but I, you know, really believe that it's part of my, you know, it's a kind of destiny thing.  It's kind of like I've been able to stay out of the--you know, to have my own privacy.  I've chosen to stay out of the, you know, to kind of stay in the background.  But I haven't chosen to lessen my, you know, the financial and, and creative rewards that come along with success.
Story_ID: 9888
Speaker 1: And do you think you were able to assimilate so easily, because it's a different culture than New York and a different culture than Boston [Massachusetts], different culture than, you know, the East coast.  Do you think it was because you, you know, you had these heir apparents whether it was through, you know, Aaron, Aaron Reuben [producer] and, you know, when you were working on a real, a hit show.  I'm just, I'm just--
Speaker 2: I think, well, you know, once again, in the previous years I'd worked with a lot entertainers, a lot of musical entertainers, many of whom--some of whom lived in, L.A. [Los Angeles, California]  So I already knew, I already had contacts and friends in L.A.  I'd done a film here.  I knew, you know, I had people in the political arena, but once again, I came to work.  I came to make--I didn't need money.  I had a place to stay for the first, you know, at least when I came out here to for, for 'Sanford and Son', I stayed at the Sunset Marquis [Hotel] and I, you know, I had a car.  And so it was very easy for me to make that part of the transition.  And I decided to move after that six weeks and, got an agent and I realized that there was this world of work for me.  I mean I, it was very easy--'Sanford & Son' was very easy for me.  I had already directed, plays for television that were much more, you know, not to mention the series 'On Being Black'.  So what I'm saying is that I, I had already, it was not hard for me to assimilate into L.A. at all.  Right around the time I was having, I had been living with Eleanor McCoy for about a year.  And, no, I'm sorry.  This is '75 [1975].  By '75 [1975] I already had a four year old daughter named Sanaa, say a three year old daughter, four year old.  She was born in '71 [1971].  So we, I decided to move them out here.  Let's just go to L.A., which happened.  So I got a little house over in Fonson Canyon and proceeded to become a freelance director in L.A.  And, you know, maintained the strong ties to all of my PBS contacts.  So, you know, over the next few years I directed two pieces for the American Short Stories series, which was a Ernest Gaines' piece and a Richard Wright piece that were both very successful.
Speaker 1: 'Almost a Man'.
Speaker 2: 'Almost a Man'.  And, and The 'Sky is Gray' by Ernest Gaines.  And they both became very hot on the festival circuit.  I got to go to the London [England] Film Festival and the San Remo [Italy] Film Festival, Telluride [Film Festival, Telluride, Colorado], a couple of others.  I got to do a, I guess that was even a few more years later.  This was like in the, in '76 [1976], '77 [1977], '78 [1978].  So and I was able to maintain my PBS relationships and continue to be, you know, to do shows like 'Eight is Enough' and '[The] Waltons' and, and 'James at Fifteen', you know, multiple episodes of those shows.  And, you know, sitcoms here and there.  So I was, you know, became a really, kind of a very busy director; directed a couple of theater pieces in L.A. also.
Speaker 1: Who was your agent?  Do you still have the same agent or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --who was agent at the time?
Speaker 2: I've had ten agents since, since '76 [1976].  The first agent was at [The] William Morris [Agency].  It was a woman named Joan Heiler who became a very big agent, you know, afterwards.  And then I came out to L.A., I was with IFA, International Famous Agency, which became ICM [International Creative Management] when they merged with CMA [Creative Management Associates.]  And then I was with a couple of smaller agents.  And then I eventually got, you know, became a client at CAA [Creative Artists Agency]--I've been with CAA the longest.  I went to Endeavor [Agency] for while, but I came back.  So I'm very comfortable as a CAA agent--client, except that the Broadway show was represented by an agent from William Morris because William Morris has a strong, much stronger Broadway, theatrical division.  And I managed to get CAA to agree to let me be represented by them for the show.  That was a little bit of a conflict, but they worked it out.
Speaker 1: Now, did you feel that your--I mean, I know you say you've been through several agents, but did you feel that that agent helped sort of guide, you know, your career at the beginning, here and--I mean and, and you were saying often I would show up and they were surprised by this black guy?
Speaker 2: Well, what happens in the sitcom world and in the, the episodic world, is that, you know, all these shows are produced by studios.  And so a director will oftentimes, and writers, you know, studios will get their favorites.  The 'Sanford and Son' show was done by, it was Norman Lear's Tandem Productions.  Going, coming out of that, the first couple shows I did were for Lorimar [Television], which no longer exists, but it was a company that, in fact, Les Moonves, was the president of Lorimar at the time.  And once I got on the Lorimar kind of cycle, you know, I did, you know, 'James at Fifteen', you know, they kind of hire directors--they, it's the studio that sends directors from one show to another.  So you walk into a show, and they say we want you to--of course, the producers of the show have to actually approve the director.  So I'd walk into a show that the studio had suggested that they meet Stan Lathan.  And he walks in and they are surprised that he's black.  To the studio he's, all he is, is a guy that brings it in on time and on budget.  That's all they care about.  And I was able to do that consistently.
Speaker 1: So, and has that been a history of black directors in Hollywood that they founded that color blind?  I'm just--
Speaker 2: I think that there are directors that I know that have been doing sitcom, do episodic television on a regular basis, Michael Schultz, Bill Duke, Oz Scott, Thomas Carter, maybe four or five others, that probably, once you get in that, in that circle, it's not about color at all.  Getting there and the path to getting there is, is all about color where whatever it takes for us as individuals to overcome whatever obstacles exists because of racism that's institutionalized in this business.  I managed, I think, to get in at a time when--and to establish a reputation that allowed me to kind of not have to deal with a lot of the--not have to be subjected to a lot of the barriers.  But part of that is what we talked about when I say that I never expected, I always felt like I was going to like do what I wanted to do because that's the way I'd kind of was raised.  So even as a young student in Boston, decided that I wanted to go to do this theater company and not feeling at all worried about my future because I just felt like it was going to happen for me.  And I was going to make it happen.  So I never--I'm still aware of being a black man in a white man's society in Hollywood.
Speaker 1: You are?
Speaker 2: I have--absolutely.  But I never felt like I had to sacrifice anything.  I mean any manhood--anything in any given situation.  And once you get on a white show, like a 'Falcon Crest' or a 'Remington Steele' or a 'Hill Street Blues' or a 'Cagney & Lacey' or 'Miami Vice', all shows that I've done, it's all about, you know, getting the work in the can and getting the best out of the actors.  Once you get to the point.
Story_ID: 9889
Speaker 1: Can I ask a question that is, I mean that it shows a lack of industry.  When, when shows hire directors, how many directors--are you, are there several directors directing different episodes?
Speaker 2: It depends on the kind of show.  Sitcoms often have one director or two directors.  The episodic TV shows, the hours, they can't, you know, because one director is, is--they're like little movies.  So one director is, is prepping while the other director is shooting.  You could, you know, you can probably get multiples.  And the situation with me is that I--somewhere early on in the, in the ninety, mid-'90's [1990s] I started, I was able to raise the stakes from being a, just a director to a producer as part of my deal, and an executive producer in some cases.  So I was able to get, so and, and like in the 'Steve Harvey Show', I was executive producer and director.  And I directed every episode for five seasons.  Cedric the Entertainer series that we just shot last year, I directed every episode.  And I just did a couple of pilots this season, you know, where I directed most of the episodes of one [unclear sentence].  So, it's not abnormal for one director to attach himself to a half-hour show and to stay with it for the whole season, for, for, or even, sometimes for multiple seasons.  It's just when I'm--you know, as a, as an executive producer and I also have back end, then it's in my best interest to make sure that, you know, to take the time and effort to try to make sure it stays on the air. 'Steve Harvey' was an example where it worked.  And we got on.  We got a 130 shows in the can so I guess we'll see some profits at some point.
Story_ID: 9890
Speaker 1: Now, I--the question I'd asked before was what shows did you, have you sort of liked the best?  You know, I had, I had positioned it with 'Sanford and Son' was the, you know, the show that you sort of liked doing the best.  So you've done a lot of them.  And there was 'Martin'.  So I'm just, I'm just wondering what--
Speaker 2: Of the shows, of my, of my--I liked 'Sanford and Son' a lot.  I liked 'Hill Street Blues' a lot.  I liked--'Martin', you know I just, I did the pilot of 'Martin'.  And I did the first episode, and then I--well, I moved on.  And I did, because I was the, the regular director on 'Roc' at the time, and I was a producer on 'Roc'.  So 'Roc' was a show that I really enjoyed doing. We did the two seasons live.  Well, one season live.  We had a live season and we did, did a couple of live specials in the first season.  So that was really cool.  It was challenging, fun, got home early because it was live.  (Laughs)  And then I liked that a lot.  I liked, I liked all of the dance things that I did [for PBS].  I felt like, I feel, still feel very strongly about working with Martha Graham and Agnes DeMille and Alvin [Ailey], that they were really--of the artists that I worked with, they were probably the most intensely creative and driven.  You have to be and run a dance company, to raise the money and work the dancers and make it beautiful at the same time.
Speaker 1: Now with--(pause)'Roc', 'Roc', it was 'Roc'.  'Roc', why don't you think 'Roc' worked.  I mean most people say because the audiences aren't, you know, ready for--
Speaker 2: 'Roc', 'Roc' was on for three seasons and did, we did seventy episodes.  I think the reason why it went off the air is because Charles [Dutton] was so driven to speak out on issues that were not comedic.  And he wanted to use the show as a platform.  And we had a modicum of success in the beginning of being able to weave, you know, serious subjects into a comedy show.  But it was very difficult, and he was very driven to, and, and very strongly influenced by his own causes and his own, he felt like he had a platform that he should use.  And it, and it, it worked for a while, but Fox didn't feel the same way.  So eventually they really soured on the show and on, and on the way we did it.  So, that's why it went away.
Speaker 1: Now, which was the--would you say of the cast that you worked with, were any better ensemble casts than others?
Speaker 2: I think the 'Roc' cast was probably the most, you know, the tightest, best actor, best overall group of actors.  They were, they had all worked together in the theater.  They were really a wonderful cast to work with, and, and Charles Dutton is a, you know, is a inspired actor.  He also has strong leadership capacity, you know.  And he's--I just think that that was an exemplary show, you know, committed cast, pretty good scripts.  And I enjoyed that experience a lot.
Speaker 1: And 'Hill Street Blues', did you enjoy that so much because of the type of show it was at the time?  You know, it was, it was a new--
Speaker 2: I enjoyed it because, you know, I worked for--David Lynch was the executive producer when I did it.  That was, [Steven] Bochco had kind of moved on.  And I just felt like it was a very provocative, it was, you know, it was progressive television.  We shot it in a, in a very exciting way.  It--we had great casting and great stories.  It was just a well-done show.  I mean a show that delivered to a director already in great shape.  You know, you can't beat that cast either.  And by the time I got there, they had already done it for a couple of seasons, so they were honed.  For me, it was, it was just a very intense experience, very much so.
Speaker 1: And did work--how long did you work on 'Hill Street Blues'?
Speaker 2: Over the course of a couple of seasons.  I did, you know, a bunch of shows.  I did--the very last episode.  I did the first--in the last season, I did the first episode and the last episode.  And it was cool.
Story_ID: 9891
Speaker 1: When you're working on episodic TV like that, what is the--I mean how much preparation is required and how much time off and I mean does it allow you to do a lot of other things?
Speaker 2: I managed to do a lot of other things.  You know, there's seven days of prep for a seven-day shoot.  During the shooting days, it was, you know, like fourteen hour days for a director.  Probably twelve hour shooting days, but there's a little prep.  You don't get a lot done during the week, but it's not rocket science.  I mean it's not like I got to spend the, you know, a Director has to spend a lot of time worrying about the show when he's not on the set.  And in prep, it's about finding locations and casting for the most part.  So during the prep week, you know, you have a little bit of, more time to yourself, depending on, you know, to what extent you're, you feel you need to prepare.  And, you know, you can spend a lot of time worrying about every shot or you can kind of do it when you get to it.
Speaker 1: But then if you're working--
Speaker 2: Go ahead.
Speaker 1: Okay, if you're working on, you know, like one episode, that's going to take how--I mean it, it's sort of half, not even half a year, right?  (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: One episode?
Speaker 1: I mean not--I'm sorry.  For a series, I'm sorry.  Not one episode.
Speaker 2: Well, with the '[The] Steve Harvey' show when we did that, we had started in August and we ended in, in late January.  And we had worked three weeks and then it, with a week, and then there's a week off, and then three weeks, and it's a week off.  But you manage to do other things.  I did.  I was producing 'Def Comedy Jam' during the 'Steve Harvey Show'.

Speaker 1: Okay, now, I want to ask you about [Jackie] 'Moms' Mabley because you worked with her.  And, and I just want you to share a couple, if you have any, [Jackie] 'Moms' Mabley stories of your time with her.
Speaker 2: Well, I had a great time with Moms.  I actually--the film that we did with her was called "Amazing Grace."  And it was kind of at the end of her career.  She had been a huge star in the '30's [1930s] and '40's [1940s], mainly in the 40's [1940s], and we actually shot this film in the early '70's [1970s].  It was called--and then Matt Robinson wrote it.  And so for her, it was a very important project.  And she wasn't in the best of health.  In fact, half way through the filming, she had an episode with her heart, kind of like a heart attack.  And I guess it's either a heart attack or not, but she had, we had to shut down while she had a pacemaker inserted, and she came back with the pacemaker.  And we actually had a person who doubled for her, who we shot--whenever we were at a scene we were on our back, which was a lot of the time, we had another person playing her.  And we would only go to her for close-ups and so even for walking shots, this woman would, would do Moms' business.  And then, but it turned out, the film, we actually finished the film.  But Moms was, was very mischievous.  She would do things like--she, she couldn't understand why she had to wear the same dress every day, even though film took place in like three days.  So, you know, everyday she would, we would be shooting a, you know, a scene that was, that was following a scene that we had just shot.  And she had this housecoat because she played a woman in, that lived in Baltimore [Maryland], who was just an old woman who was very concerned about her community.  And so she wouldn't understand, and so she always, you know, fought on that.  I want to wear better dresses.  "You can't, Moms, because this is continuity."  So then she would do things like, we noticed in the editing room that she had actually slipped on her diamond earrings in one scene and nobody caught it.  And then another time, you know, she was sitting there with, and her hands were crossed, and there was a huge diamond rock on her hand.  So she was like, you know, this was her way of, of getting us back for making her wear the same dress.  And she was great to work with, you know, she was, she was a born comedian, and even though she wasn't in the best of health, she always--she was very witty and always kept the crew in stitches.  And she used to tell us a lot of the old stories about her days in New York as a comedian and how Martha Rae and, and other comedians would come up and steal her material (laughs).  And she was, it was great.
Story_ID: 9924
Speaker 1: Because you really work, you know, when you think about your work with Redd Foxx and then, you know, Moms Mabley, those were the two, you know, though he lived longer than she, you know, she did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I worked with--you know, I was blessed on the comedian front because not only did I work with Moms, and even in that film, Slappy White was in that film, Lincoln Perry, better known as 'Stepin Fetchit' was in that film, Butterfly McQueen.  So, and that was my first exposure to the old, you know, the funny people.  And then I worked with, with Redd.  And I did a special with Flip Wilson in the early '70's [1970s].  I worked, I worked extensively with [Richard] Pryor during the, the mid to late '70's [1970s].  And I actually shot part of the "[Richard Pryor] Live on Sunset Strip" film.  So, and then went on to have relationships with, with all of the poet--all of the comedians for 'Def Poetry'--'Def Comedy' (laughs).  And, in fact, one of the reasons that I was so aware of comedy was because of my, my history with the, with the older comedians.  So when Russell [Simmons] and I got together, it was, comedy was an area that, you know, I was already kind of into.  And black comedians were people that I had a great deal of respect for, the good ones.
Story_ID: 9925
Speaker 1: I think the best comedians are the ones that have just a natural gift of being able to, you know, to make people laugh.  And it's, it's like any other--it's like a painter.  It's like there're all kinds of painters that are good.  You know, their, that have different styles, you know, different things about their work that makes them good, or singers.  There are comedians with all different kinds of approaches to their comedy and all different kinds of things that inspire them.  I find that when you look at people like Richard Pryor and Bill Cosby, you know, there's, you know, there are a lot of things about them that are similar, but they really do come from two totally different points of view in the way they approach the work, not necessarily what the work is about, but the way they approach it.  The same with, you know, Redd Foxx and Richard Pryor though, you, you could find a lot of similarities, but there's a lot of differences also.  And I think that it's a natural gift.  It's like the gift that Kobe Bryant has as opposed to the gift that Oscar Robinson has.  It's a, you know, they both, you know, are magnificent in what they do, but they do it differently.  And it's hard to, to, to kind of verbalize what it is.  So, and so, you know, I'm--it's interesting because you look at Bernie Mac and you look at Cedric the Entertainer.  Once again, totally different, and their, their material is different, the way they relate to the art is, but yet they both have that gift.  And I think that the good comedians are the ones that really want to sell that gift, really want to get out there and make people laugh.  Moms Mabley was the first person I met that was like that.  If there were three people in the room, she was on.  Redd Foxx, if there were two people in the room, he was on, the whole time.  It never ended.  There was never a moment when he wasn't looking for a way to elicit a laugh.  If there were five or six people in the room, it was, it was only about Redd because he was, he would take it over.  And people would be, would be falling out.  Steve Harvey has that same kind of thing about him, you know, and yet he's a very serious man.  Here's a man who has to do strong convictions and commitments to, you know, to, to--trying to do the right thing as far as society is concerned.  He's a, he's a strong father and, but there's something about, you know, his ability, even when he's down, to make other people just feel good.
Story_ID: 9926
Speaker 1: Now, the story of "Amazing Grace", how did that happen or come to be?  Do you know, I mean--
Speaker 2: Matt Robinson wrote the, wrote a script called "Amazing Grace", about a woman in Baltimore [Maryland] who, who helps to kind of turn around a crooked politician.  And he wrote it for [Jackie] 'Moms' Mabley because he, Matt was a, sort of a, an authority on the old comedians.  You know, he, almost a, almost a comedic historian.  And he sold it to United Artists.  They bought it, and, and a lot of it had to do with the fact that they knew that, that there was a, there's an, a executive at United Artists, David [V.] Picker, who was the president, who also appreciated the contribution that Moms Mabley had made to American comedy.  And we all wanted to see it happen before she wasn't around any more.  And we all knew that, you know, that she was at a point in her life where her career certainly was, was coming to an end.  So we rushed and made that movie.
Speaker 1: And the movie did, the movie did relatively well, didn't it?
Speaker 2: It did okay.
Speaker 1: Did okay, okay.
Speaker 2: It did okay.  Well, you know, we suffered from her inability to really show up, you know, for the, for the whole thing.
Speaker 1: Now, how had you met Matt?  Do you--?
Speaker 2: Matt and I kind of grew up together in New York.  He was, he's a little older than me.  He was a buddy of my older brother.  So, and he was a, he worked at WCAU in New York.  And then he went off to do "Sesame Street".  He was the original Gordon on Sesame Street.  And right about the time I was coming out of college with my, my filmmaking ambitions and television ambitions, he and I kind of hooked back up together when I got to New York in '68 [1968], '69 [1969].
Story_ID: 9927
Speaker 1: Martin Lawrence is also a comedian, and you had a long affiliation with that show.  And you were actually the producer, right?
Speaker 2: No, I directed the pilot.  Martin Lawrence was another person, who in the mid-to late'60's [1960s] [sic.1990s], you know, started to emerge in Los Angeles [California] as a--I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: I was gonna say (laughter).
Speaker 2: I know, he wasn't born yet.  Martin Lawrence is another person who in the late--mid to late '90's [1990s], you know, started to emerge in the Los Angeles area in the clubs as a comedian who was building an audience.  It was a local audience, of course.  He had also, you know, he was from D.C., so he kind of had a, a little following there, along with, you know, a real kid named Dave Chappelle at the time, who was like fourteen or fifteen, was actually going on stage.  And Martin, in, in L.A. there was a, a kind of a developing comedy scene that was at the Comedy Act Theater.  Every Thursday night, there would be a comedy night.  And there were all of the, the young comedians were there.  And they, and they were, they were, you know, they built an audience.  Every Thursday night, it was Comedy Act Theater night.  And Martin was one of the rising stars, along with D. L. Hughley, along with J. Anthony Brown, and, you know, people like that would go through there.  So we--Russell [Simmons] and I would go there on, you know, on occasion when he was in town.  And we also went to another club in New York called the Comedy Act Theater, where there was another group of the kind of New York, East Coast comedians.  And it was, there were clubs in Atlanta [Georgia] and Chicago [Illinois].  And this was all in the late '90's [1990s], where there would be a night, one night where people would go to see the black comedians.  And it was raw, and it was exciting and it was very, very, very popular among the young, young crowd.  So we--Martin was our favorite.  And when we, when we finally, when we finally got to a point where we were, we had figured that this would be a good thing to put on television, and we knew that HBO was the only place to do it, we actually got HBO executives to come to the one in L.A. and the one in New York.  And we convinced them that they should let us produce four comedy shows.  And we thought Martin Lawrence was the guy to host because he kind of exemplified the young, brash, you know, very talented, and yet, just audacious comedian that we wanted to, you know, that had the kind of a--it was, it was kind of a hip-hop sensibility, you know, sort of a comedic approach to the same kinds of, of issues that the rappers were dealing with at the time.  So it worked, and Martin was the one that, that really kind of stood out in the, in the early, in the early stages, so much so that HBO, HIP, which was the HBO production company, developed a sitcom for him, that I directed, called "Martin", and it became a huge success, and now in, in syndication, it's a huge success.  So, and now he's a big star, making movies, one after another.
Speaker 1: And you found him?
Speaker 2: I really can't say I found him.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) but you made that--?
Speaker 2: I took advantage of his, his availability at a time when other people didn't, you know, weren't paying attention.  I certainly didn't discover him as such, and I certainly didn't, you know, didn't give him his start.  I, you know, Russell [Simmons] and I were there in the beginning, and we kind of worked together.
Story_ID: 9928
Speaker 1: And how did you, how did you and Russell [Simmons] come to know each other?
Speaker 2: Russell and I kind of traveled in the same circles in the mid-80's [1980s], early '80's [1980s].  I, I directed a film called "Beat Street" in '84 [1984].  Russell--it was about the hip-hop, you know, culture.  Russell, at the time was a, kind of a figment in, in the hip-hop culture as he is now.  But then he was, he was a, he was a young hustler that was making things happen.  He was producing concerts.  He was, and he had his record company [Def Jam] starting.  And he was involved with a lot of the artists.  So we naturally kind of crossed paths there.  And then he did another thing--and then he was involved in a film called "Krush Groove", which my friend, Ralph Farqhuar wrote, my friend, Michael Schultz, directed, George Jackson and Doug McHenry produced it.  And they were all close friends.  So we all, you know, the--we kind of, the crowds started to merge and the relationships started to develop around that time, around mid to late '80's [1980s].  Russell and I eventually started talking about doing things together.  He respected the fact that I was a, kind of a Hollywood television director and movie director who had, you know, experience and contacts and connections.  I believed that he was a, a driven entrepreneur who had great potential.  And, and then we kind of came together to kind of see how we--what we could do to, you know, together and, you know, that might develop into something.  The first project that we did together was "Def Poet--Def Comedy Jam."
Speaker 1: And how did that come about?
Speaker 2: We, as we looked for something to do together, that's when we started visiting these comedy clubs.  And we, I had a relationship with HBO because I had been doing work for them.  And we got our HBO, my HBO contacts to, you know, to, to agree to do this, this TV show.  We wanted to do it raw.  We wanted to do it late night, and HBO didn't have, really have a late-night presence.  So they were very interested in doing something late night.  And we also wanted it to feel, we wanted it to feel like, feel like it was in a dangerous place that people wouldn't go, the HBO audience wouldn't go, and never would, wouldn't dare go.  But yet the comedy was undeniable.  The early shows, the first four--we, we got, we got an offer for four shows.  The first four shows that we had, had Martin hosting and Chris Tucker, Bernie Mac, Steve Harvey, Cedric the Entertainer, Adele Givens, Sommore, Eddie Griffin and Bill Bellamy, J. Anthony Brown.  It was just, you know--Vickie Harris--it was just packed with comedians who are now stars in their own right.  And we were worried that we wouldn't be able to get (mic disruption)-- we were worried that we would be able to find twenty comedians to do four shows.  And we figured it would be five comedians in each show.  So we taped thirty, figuring it would, there would be some that would fall out.  And we ended up squeezing them all on the four shows.  The shows were so successful that HBO wanted eight more.  So we started looking, you know, we hired a, we had, we hired a producer named Bob Sumner who was, had, you know, plugged into the comedy.  And he began to establish relationships in the major cities across the country with the club owners, getting them to--and, and he would visit these clubs on black night in places like Norfolk [Virginia] and, and Los Angeles and San Francisco and Oakland [California] and Miami [Florida] and Dayton, Ohio.  And once this show started to air, these clubs started to proliferate.  And Bob was the man to call.  And they would have comedy nights, Def Comedy nights where, where all the top comedians in the area would show up to audience for Def Comedy Jam.  And out of those places, you know, people like Mike Epps and Flex Alexander, and I can name a number of comedians, Monique, Tracy Murray, people like that started to emerge from those kinds of, of nights.  And, and before we knew it, we were, you know, on a roll.  We actually shot ninety shows by the time it was over.  And on the second year, we started the Def Comedy tour which was huge.  It just sold out everywhere.  In fact, there were--there was a point in the early '90's [1990s] where we had two units out, going in two different directions.  So a given Friday night, we'd be selling out in, in Cleveland [Ohio] and we'd be selling out in St. Louis [Missouri] at the same time.  It was, it was big.  And the industry started to catch, the Hollywood industry.  So you started seeing more and more of these comedians being given television deals.  And you would show up, and you, we could show up at a concert in, in, you know, in South Bend [Indiana] and, you know, you'd see five or six Hollywood agents there, like there to, to scope out two or three of the, of the comedians that were starting to get reputations.  So, it was, for us it was quite an exciting adventure in the early days of Def Comedy.
Speaker 1: You know, what's interesting about that because there had been comedy clubs, I think really in the 80's [1980s], like the mid-80's [1980s] where, not, not the Def Comedy, but, you know, just really there had been a proliferation of comedy clubs that had come to being, and then had sort of waned by the time that Def Comedy came into being, which is--you know, it's sort of, you know--
Speaker 2: It's true.  We were a shot in arm for the whole comedy industry.  And you can talk to certain club owners in, in, in major cities, and they'll, and they'll attest to that.  And when you look at, you know, the number of shows that have starred African American comics, all of them had their, you know, had their early, an exposure on Def Comedy.
Story_ID: 9929
Speaker 1: What do you think was done right then?  I mean, what were the magic ingredients?  I mean you clearly see you had this talent, you were sort of jam packed with talent with those early shows.  But what were the other things that you think, you know, really--HBO, that was--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think that, once again, and HBO was smart enough, and I think we helped them to, to understand that this was a phenomenon.  And I think the magic, you know, all we needed to do was find people who were really talented and, and give them exposure and enough promotion to, you know, to let people know about it.  HBO, HBO's subscriptions were, you know, went way up.  And they, and then suddenly they had, they had African Americans coming in droves.  People were, were getting HBO so that they could see Def Comedy.  One second (interruption).
Speaker 1: So everything, so you're saying HBO, the black market had just started coming in droves.
Speaker 2: Oh, the black market started coming in droves.  And they, and they--we actually put them, and this is no--there's no question about this.  We actually put HBO in the late-night business because in the, in the cities, in the HBO cities, in the HBO homes, there were, there were--the ratings were, were the highest in the market.  They were beating out  [Tonight Show with] Jay Leno, everybody, yeah, 'Nightline', all of that on Friday nights at midnight.  People were turning off Jay to go to, to Def, Def, I mean to Def Comedy Jam.  They followed that with, with shows like, you know, eventually--the 'Chris Rock Show', certainly, the, the groundwork was laid for the Chris Rock Show, which was a show that came on after we went off the air.  And interestingly enough, Chris Rock was one of the early comedians who said he wouldn't do it because it was too vulgar in the first two seasons.  The third season, he hosted a show because on the road, you needed to have Def Comedy on your, on your resume.  And you, and it was a, it was an instant exposure to the national black audience.  If you're going on the road, you wanted to have been on the show.  You want to be able to say you've been on the show, but you want to, you want people to know--if you're really good, you want people to see you.  And so it, it helped create, not only the Def Comedy Tour, but many other tours.  You know, eventually, the' Kings of Comedy' were the four guys that had been on Def Com--Def Poet, Def Comedy repeatedly.  One of the things we realized is that, the--it's like, it's like singers.  It's like MTV.  If you, you know, the, the repeat factor really worked.  So they loved Martin [Lawrence].  He was on all the time.  And they loved Bernie Mac.  The first day that he was on, and he, he blew it away, we knew he was huge.  So he was on, he was on a couple of times.  Steve Harvey was on four times.  Cedric the Entertainer was on four times.  There were, you know, Mike Epps was on a couple of times.  Adele Givens was on four times.  Adele Givens right now is, has never stopped working since then.  And that's, that's now, you know, twelve, twelve years later, she's, she has a great career as a stand-up comedian.  She travels all over the country and gets paid really well to--and her comedy has evolved.  She does poetry now.  Monique, we know what happened with her.  She's a huge star.  She was on several times.  And Chris Tucker was on, you know, several times.  So we believed that that was important because now people were, there were people that they wanted to see, they--that we were building personalities that would, would be easily identifiable to an audience.
Speaker 1: And this also was reflective of the urban audience, right?  I mean, I'm just saying at the same time that this happening, Hip-Hop was definitely in its stride.  You have, is UPN at that point--
Speaker 2: No, UPN came along a little later.
Speaker 1: Little later, but we have, you have, the other one--?
Speaker 2: WB [Warner Brothers Network].
Speaker 1: WB.
Speaker 2: Yeah, cause the WB was the first ones to, WB put, you know, bought the 'Steve Harvey Show' in the mid-90's [1990s].  And I was, I was, you know, part of the team that created that.  And Cedric was a co-star on that.  That was before the 'Kings of Comedy'.  And so, and then UPN came along, and, and both of those--it's interesting because the WB was run by the people that had originally gotten Fox off the ground.  And one of the things that helped to, to launch Fox was "In Living Color."  So they were very wise to, you know, to, to get some, some African American programming.  And they lit the--they bought the Robert Townsend Show, Family--what was it [Parent Hood], well, I don't know.  I'm sorry, I don't remember.  I'm embarrassed that I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Not "Family Ties", (unclear) I was gonna "Family Ties", and that's--
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Robert Town--
Speaker 2: Robert Townsend Show [sic. Parent Hood], they bought that.  They bought the, they bought the "Jamie Foxx Show".  The bought the "Steve Harvey Show", and they, they wise very wise to do that.
Speaker 1: So, are you saying that once--was it HBO first and then WB?
Speaker 2: Okay, so, but I'm just trying--
Speaker 1: I was on a roll, huh?
Speaker 2: You are.  WB.
Speaker 1: Do you want to do a tape change right now?
Speaker 2: No, WB, I'm just trying to understand.  Was it HBO--when did, I'm just trying to understand timing.  It was HB--it was Def Comedy on HBO--?
Speaker 1: Def Comedy was sold to HBO first.  HBO, without HBO, there wouldn't have been a Def Comedy--
Speaker 2: But was WB in existence around that same time?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The WB was started, kind of starting.  The thing was that the reason why it worked, and the reason why it--was that HBO was allowing, was able to let us do it raw.  They let us, they let the language flow and, and thus, the subject matter.  Had it not been for HBO, and if we had to do it on broad--we couldn't have done it on broadcast.  So for that reason, it was, there was nothing like it on television anywhere.  Sure, you know, they had--HBO would have other concerts.  It would have George Carlin and somebody that might, you know, say a couple of, say the "F" word one or two times.  But to really get, you know, into, you know, get down and, and deal on a level that people do in the streets, you know, on the street, and tell the kind of jokes that we used to sneak and listen to and do Redd Foxx records, it was something that was, I think, a very important factor in helping to build this, what is now a big industry in comedy.
Speaker 2: And that cemented you and Russell's [Simmons] relationship then in many ways, right?
Speaker 1: We kind of, yeah, we kind of hit the ground running with a, with a real successful venture.
Speaker 2: Okay, and that went from like 1991 to, you know, with the tours and everything to--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) I think it was '97 [1997] or something like that.
Speaker 2: Ninety-seven, okay.  And so, you--
Speaker 1: The tours actually continued beyond that.
Story_ID: 9930
Speaker 1: Okay, I want to go back to "Beat Street" because one of the things, wasn't Harry Belafonte one of the producers?
Speaker 2: Harry Belafonte was the producer of "Beat Street."
Speaker 1: He was "Beat Street".  Okay, so, have you--
Speaker 2: He and, he and David Picker, who--
Speaker 1: Okay, had he brought, had he brought you in or were you just sort of part of that.  I'm just trying to understand.
Speaker 2: No, I was hired as a director.
Speaker 1: Okay, (laughter).  Tell me, okay, okay.  Had you worked with Harry before or--
Speaker 2: No, I hadn't--
Story_ID: 9931
Speaker 1: Can you talk about 'Roc' and how it came about, you know, how the whole project even came into being?
Speaker 2: Well, 'Roc' came into, into being because of Fox's interest in Charles Dutton who was, at the time, you know, a really successful Broadway actor, had won a Tony for "Piano Lesson" and he was, he was just a, you know, a terrific actor--he still is, of course.  And they were very interested in working with him.  And so Stan Daniels created this series called 'Roc', and it was kind of based on an idea that, that Charles Dutton had.  It was set in Baltimore [Maryland] where he was raised.  And they were smart enough to cast it with the actors from, that Charles had worked with in "Piano Lesson".  It was the very same cast, with the exception of S. Epatha Merkenson who wasn't available.  But they hired Ella Joyce who was a wonderful, and who had also--who was also an actor who had worked in a lot of August Wilson shows.  So they, they really, you know, we put this, you know, we put this show on Fox, and I actually got involved after it was, after it was, it was launched.  And I was kind of, I was, you know, I was around in the, you know, kind of hardly available.  And once it was launched, I came in and, and produced and directed for three years.  And it was great for me because I got to work with the amazing actors, all of whom were still close friends.  And we really tried to do some, some bold things.  We tried to keep it funny because you have to do that, but we tried to keep it as real as possible.  And in some cases, we actually got into some pretty serious territory.  We did a couple of shows about drugs and about drug dealers and about, you know, poverty and, and it was a kind of, this, this, this vein of, you know, the fact that they were living on the edge as working-class people who really worked hard.  But still, you know, had, had to work to make ends meet.  And so we dealt with that in a sober way, many times. And sometimes Fox would feel like we were getting too dramatic.  But it, it worked for three years.  And then I think that it kind of ran its course with Fox.
Speaker 1: You know there have been people that said that he had gotten--that Dutton wanted to speak out and be more political and, and that was one of the issues.  Is that not the case?
Speaker 2: I think that that kind of ate away at the relationship with Fox.  There's no question that he, that Charles wanted to do that.  And he, and we did it, we did it.  You know, we had a show that was live for two seasons, actually live.  And there were times when that show got pretty intense.  And we had a really dedicated and, and loyal audience, but I don't think it was as big as, as Fox would have liked it to be.  Other people don't want to be confronted with, with serious issues on television.  And if you look at the tot--the shows that are on now, and even in prime time, you'll find very few serious issues are really dealt with in, in the dramatic and comedy shows.  You know, they--you, you look at shows like "NYPD Blue" and, you know, they don't, they, you know, it's about crime and punishment as opposed to, you know, the condition of society and, you know, the political and social truths aren't really dealt with as much as they should be.  They, you know, they are touched upon.
Speaker 1: Now, the others--how was the decision to make that live?  That was the other, I--
Speaker 2: Well, there was a, it was initially a marketing kind of promotional gimmick, you know.  And one of the reasons why they, they--and Fox actually would love, have loved for us to mess up.  They would have loved for actors to like miss their lines and things like that.  They wanted to have that kind of thing go on, and it didn't happen because we had a cast.  And there were times when they wouldn't go up, but they were so skilled that you wouldn't know it because they would cover it.  They would, they'd step in say somebody's line for them, you know, but, but turn it around so that they would--and it was because they were, they were act--they were theater actors.
Speaker 1: They had come out of the Yale Repertory [Theatre, New Haven, Connecticut], hadn't they?
Speaker 2: Well he had--No, he came out of there, yeah, right (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Dutton, right, right.  Okay--
Speaker 2: And they had all worked in the Yale Rep in the original, "Piano Lesson," but, but I think--but Charles actually had a masters degree from Yale [University School of Drama, New Haven, Connecticut], went to Yale and then, you know, did work in Yale.
Story_ID: 9932
Speaker 1: Now, was this, (unclear), it was the first time, but did you enjoy playing the role of, you know, of producer?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you talk about that because--?
Speaker 2: Well, that, that's something that I, I think that, you know, and somewhere around the mid-80s [1980s], maybe even before that, I had, you know, I, I had aspirations or, or thoughts about having more control of the work.  You know, I'd--for twenty years now, then, I had been, just say for fifteen years, I'd been a director for hire, and I'd never had to worry about working.  And I made a pretty good living.  But there's something to be said for one having control of the material that you work on.  And, and more importantly, have ownership in the material.  So part of what drove me to kind of seek out Russell [Simmons] and that, you know, that, was the fact that, you know, he had very strong entrepreneurial aspirations and especially in the entertainment business.  And I wanted to own the material.  I wanted to, to have ownership.  I wanted to be in a situ--in a position where I didn't have to answer to anybody, and that when I know that something goes into heavy profits, that I'm involved.  You know, we're hear to make money at the end of the day.  The entertainment business, if you, if you're working the commercial entertainment business, you're making somebody money.  If, you know, if--as a director, I put together a great show, somebody's gonna get, gonna, gonna benefit from that.  I want to be a part of that.  So that, that goes into television and as well as into, into all the other things that we do.  So it, and 'Roc' was the first sitcom.  After that I did many, many sitcoms, and I've done a lot of pilots.  So as a pilot director, you kind of have a royalty of all the shows that are shot.  And in some cases, they will negotiate a backend participation which is part of the syndication profits.  I was just at a point, going into 'Roc' when I was able to start making those kinds of deals.  So part of my deal with 'Roc' was that I was able to negotiate a producer's credit and responsibility.  And so, for three years, I helped wage the war against, the war, you know, kind of mediate the war between Fox and, and 'Roc' that had kind of developed.  But coming out of that, and kind of having the, the Def Comedy Jam experience, I then went into to do, do, you know, the, the 'Martin' show.  And now, as I started to do, to direct more and more pilots and became a, kind of a sought-after, not sought-after, but certainly hirable pilot director, then I could start to negotiate backend.  Then when 'Steve Harvey Show', I kind of helped put that together, so, you know, I kind of hit the ground as an executive producer with a, you know, a share of the profits.  And, and all of the stuff that we do, Def Comedy Jam, we own the negatives, we--outright, we, we--and it's been very, very successful, and as a DVD title, very successful.  We, you know, we have the same kind of deal with, with Def Poetry and we, you know, we did it with the, we own the Broadway show and the, then the national tour.  And it's important, and, and we had a great deal with PolyGram [Filmed Entertainment, acquired by Universal Picures] for six years, a film development deal.  We did, made a couple of films.  And we had, you know, it just, it's just that now producing, it's, it's a responsibility of anybody in this business, I think, who has creative tendencies, to try to find ways, as they develop their career, and also develop their, their share in the work that they do.  I have quite a few friends who are extraordinary directors, who had made a lot of money in their careers.  And whatever they have now is based on how they saved or invested and, and yet, certain projects that they might have worked on are still making money that they're not a part.  And I don't think that that's the way to do it.  So my, my goal from the mid-80s [1980s] through the rest of my career is to work on things that I, you know, have some sort of stake in.
Speaker 1: And that you can sit and, that the money will still keep coming in?
Speaker 2: So that my kid's, kids, will somehow benefit from my hard work.
Speaker 1: Now, what lessons have you learned, though, as a producers, cause it's one thing to think you want to do it.  It's another thing to sort of do it, you know, because as a director, as you say, you're more of a hired hand.  And so were there lessons that you learned in the--I mean you had a pretty, I won't say, you know, it seems like a pretty easy, you know, transition, but were there lessons that you learned?
Speaker 2: Sure.  You learn a lot of lessons.  I think the key is that you're responsible.  And, you know, I work in the, in the entertainment business.  I work in communications.  I do work that is, you know, is out there.  It's on the screen.  It's on the television; it's in some--it's in the movies.  And it's, and there's a responsibility that goes along with that.  So one of the things we learned is that whatever we put out there, we're gonna have to live with.  And, and so it's important, if you care, and we care, we care.  I have kids, you know.  The things that are, that, that they see and the things that they experience that has to do with stuff that I do, is very important for, you know, it's very important that I'm able to justify it.  And with 'Def Comedy Jam', there were times when it got really, really raw.  And we had, we caught a lot of flack about it.  But we believe two things.  One is, it was, it was on at midnight.  And it was on with a disclaimer saying, you know, this is raw material, if you don't want to see it--if you don't, you know, if it's gonna bother, if it was gonna bother you or whoever, you shouldn't be watching it.  But more importantly, it was us, you know, you know, kind of allowing a cultural phenomenon to find itself.  And there were those comedians who were really raw, whose material has, you know, adjusted.  Nobody was more raw than Bernie Mac, but you know see him on television doing, you know, amazing stuff that's, you know, that speaks to, to a lot of people.  And we believe that the stuff that we have that's now historical Bernie Mac material, is--we, we feel that we can justify it, that it's, you know, it, it--Russell likes to you say that, you know, people were talking about what was important to them.  And if it was, if it was sexual in nature, then so be it.  Many people probably have that, you know, that kind of prior--priority, I don't know.  But we followed Def Comedy with Def Poetry because we're now trying to be even more relevant to, you know, as art--as artists to what's going around us and what people are thinking about and what people are feeling and our state of, the state of our condition in this country, and the state of this country's condition in the world.  So we, as, as producers, you know, we do feel a great responsibility.
Story_ID: 9933
Speaker 1: Now, but Def Poetry was a, it's a sort of a different thing that, you know, it has a little more culture than comedy--I mean I'm not saying that comedy isn't really--
Speaker 2: Comedy has more culture--(laughs)
Speaker 1: (Laughs) Okay, I'm not--
Speaker 2: There nothing, you know, what's more cultural than, than [comedians] Sommore, or than people like J. Anthony Brown.  That's cultural.
Speaker 1: Well, I'm saying, I'm not talking--I'm saying "culture", like the arts (laughs) poetry and writing.  I'm just saying that, you know, there was an underground movement occurring, you know, that a lot of people didn't know, you know, with poetry slams and things like that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but it's--you know, I like to say when people say, "Wow, where did you get the idea?"  I said, you know, we didn't, you know, I--poetry has been around since man started talking.  As soon as he was, you know, able to put a few words together, poetry, you know, somehow came about.  And poetry readings have been going on.  Every since I can remember they were, you could go somewhere and hear poetry.  I remember going to coffee houses, quote, unquote in Rittenhouse Square in, in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] in the, in the, in the '60's [1960s] to hear poets and folk singers, but poets for sure.  So, and I've been aware of poetry throughout the '80s [1980s], '90s [1990s].  There was the Time Café in New York, you know, there were, there were poetry places in, in Los Angeles.  And, but what we became aware of over the last several years, and Danny's--Danny Simmons, Russell's brother and a couple of his partners, Bruce George and Debbie, Deb, Deborah Pointer, pointed out to us that, you know, there are many more young African Americans who are doing poetry, who are younger and are probably, you know, they're capable of being rappers, but they choose to express their feelings in, in more traditional ways.  And they, but they talk about things that, you know, are reminiscent of the same kinds of things that, you know, that the rappers are talking about in some cases.  And in other cases, talking about things that they feel are more, that have more depth than what we hear in the music.  So we started going to clubs in Brooklyn [New York] and Chicago [Illinois] and places where these young people were performing.  And we realized that there was real--there was really something here because not only were, were they, were they great writers, but the ones that were really successful were great performers also.  And we felt that this was what, that kind of, that African American spirit was bringing to the poetry world; the ability to like, to not only write the words, but to express the words in a way that's moving.  And I went to, to a reading in, at the Brooklyn Museum [Brooklyn, New York], you know, four years ago and was so moved.  And it was every--you know, there were young poets, Sonia Sanchez was there.  There was this, this amazing audience of young art, artistic, you know, African Americans and mixed with hip-hop people and, it was, it was so moving.  And, you know, Russell was, was sitting next to me said, "What do you think?"  He said, you know, it's, "can we do this on television?"  I said, "Absolutely."  The same thing that sold 'Def Comedy Jam' will sell 'Def Poetry Jam' to HBO.  So we brought on, brought in the same executives, only now, they were vice presidents rather than, you know, and development execs.  We had a, we had a couple of shows in New York, a couple of showcases and we sold four shows again, just like, just like the first time.  And we got the thirty greatest comedians, I'm--excuse me, I always do that.  This is what I do with my kids--I call them all out of their names.  So now I get poetry and comedy mixed up.  But we got the, we got thirty-six or so of the, of the best poets, brought them to New York, put together a really--when I say, put together, you know, elicited, you know, responses from the right audiences.  We hired an audience development person that reached out to colleges and to clubs and to, you know, so that we could put together the right people.  And now, the, the, the attempt was to create an environment that people would want to be at, that was, you know, that would seem like this cool, late-night club, somewhere in Brooklyn or Manhattan that you really would want to go to.  And so it was sort the opposite of the Def Comedy Club where we had, you know, kind of a thuggish audience.  And they said, "Damn, I don't want to be there, but, man, I sure wanted, you know, to be in on it".  So, we, we actually had, you know, four great shows again, and HBO did the same thing, picked up more.  Now, we're, we just finished shooting ten more.  So we're up to thirty.  This is the, we're in the fourth season.  And as a result of the success of the first four shows, we put together the Broadway show, Def Com--Def Poetry Jam.  And, and ran in San Francisco [California] for a few months to rave reviews, went to Bost--went to Broadway [New York, New York], got the best reviews I've ever read, consistently across the board, and ended up winning a Tony Award, which was overwhelming for me, at least.  And now, we're, we have a international tour.  We've been to the, to the Edinburgh Festival in Scotland.  We've been to the Sydney Festival in Australia.  We're going back to England next fall to do the West End [of London].  And we're gonna do fifty cities next fall, and we have sponsors now, and we're rolling, and HBO has become a sponsor of the tour.  And it's, it's--once again, it's, it's finding something that you love, something that you feel a strong commitment to, putting that love and commitment to work so that it's really done well and drawing on--we drew upon all of my experience and my contacts and my knowledge of, you know, what works.  And then, and having ownership in it so that, you know, it pays off in more than just a paycheck.
Story_ID: 9934
Speaker 1: All that explains itself, the Def, you know, Poetry, after Def Comedy, what doesn't, what is not explained, and you just sort short-shrifted, why would you even think to take something, you know, to Broadway or to do, you know, a theater run with it?  I mean whose idea was that cause that was--neither you or Russell [Simmons] had done that before.
Speaker 2: That's why we did it.  We knew--we did it because--I'll tell you.  It was a very, you know--I think that the thinking was, okay, we can't go out here on the road and do the 'Def Poetry' tour like we did the 'Def Comedy' tour.  You know, comedy sells.  Comedy, people are, you know, we'd have to educate the, the theater-going or not so much the theater-going, but the concert crowd, the--you know, to, in order to get them to go to see a poetry show or pay for a poetry show.  They're used to seeing it in the clubs.  So we had to reinvent the concept of Def Comedy--Def --we had to reinvent the concept of Def Poetry.  So Broadway figured to be a place where we could really kind of validate the fact that we had something special.  So I chose the nine most popular poets that happened to be a cross section ethnically and kind of just, you know, just their own, their, their kind--their, their styles.  And we put together, I got, put together a workshop.  And we spent, you know, several weeks trying to figure out what we could do, how we could put together a show that would, would be worth the cost of admission.  And it would be different from anything that they see on television or that they saw in, in clubs.  And that's how the show was developed.  And the poets got together.  They read to each other, they kind of critiqued each other's work.  And we ended up putting small groups together.  We had a couple of duets, a couple of trios, a quartet.  Then we had (unclear) a couple of group pieces.  And everybody, all the poets were really great writers and they became an ensemble.  And what's interesting is that poets, historically, are very competitive.  You go out, you read your think, you want the audience to respond to you more so than to the person before you or after you.  And then there's a slam mentality where, poetry slams, where, you know, had become very popular.  And there were competitions.  Poets would go out and try to read with the most emotion and, and really get the crowd riled up so that they could get high scores.  Well, I had to kind of play against that.  And a lot of the younger poets, that's what they do, they slam.  Slam means fight in, with words almost.  And so we tried to build an ensemble.  We tried to get them to not only, you know, to listen and to share and to somehow, with their, all the desperate material that they have between them, to try to get this to feel like a night that was cohesive; brought in a DJ to help that, to help use musical transitions, transitions of music that the audience would recognize and be, and, and respond to, from Al Green to John Coltrane, to, to The Cure, Ani DiFranco, people, Bruce Springsteen, and so we had this, this mélange of music and poetry and, and we started doing it.  We, we and I went out to Phoenix [Arizona] and, and Long Beach and San Diego [California] and played, you know, we, we played in front of smaller audiences just to see how they responded.  And then we ended up going to San Francisco and, and sitting in the theater for six weeks, while we developed--as if we were off-Broadway, as if we were, you know, on the road, putting together a Broadway show.  We had Broadway in mind, now.  A Broadway producer and an agent from William Morris named Susan Weaving, who was a Broadway agent, and it, you know, it--we, we called her in.  We got her input, and she felt--she believed in it, and she felt she could sell it.  We put it together.  We started running it.  We started, we finally did for reviewers.  They loved it.  We felt like we had a show, and the show has a beginning, a middle and an end.  And there's these wonderful--it's like a review only it's poetic as opposed to songs.  And the success on Broadway really did validate it.  So, you know, we're just finishing the--it's now, you know, June of 2004 or, you know, what is this now?  May of 2004, and we're finishing the first year of touring.  And it was a very successful year.  And we're, you know, we're kind of poised to develop next year's tour that will go out in the fall.  As I said, with sponsorship, with definite engagements in the Caribbean, in Australia and New Zealand and in, and in Europe, London, Stockholm [Sweden], Paris [France], Frankfurt [Germany].  So, and not to mention fifty cities in the United States.  So it was, it was the Broadway validation that helped launch it, and it helped open it up to white audiences who wouldn't have gone to see anything that has Def Jam on it.  And so our audiences are very, very mixed.  We know we can pull in the core, core African American audience, but unless we can get, you know, the theater-going audience involved, with the theater-going audience involved, we can, we can raise the ticket prices a little bit and we can play larger houses.  And then we find ways to, to do specials and the, and to do nights where, you know, everybody has a chance to see it.
Speaker 1: You know, it's amazing, you know, your beginning was in theater.  I'm just saying, you know, Broadway, what is amazing is Broadway has been dying, you know.  And you have your musicals and that's it.  And then you take something on, you know, that is not particularly done on Broadway, and you snatch a Tony Award, I mean on top of it.  So that's very amazing.
Speaker 2: I like the way you say that, "snatch a Tony Award" because it really was like that.  It was like, "Wow, we got a Tony?"  And everybody on Broadway said, "they got a Tony?"  Well, they, you know, they deserved that, so.
Speaker 1: And, and you created a new audience, and it was fresh, you know.
Speaker 2: I think that we, that the, the fact that we were there, and that we had the success we had, probably helped the people that are doing "Raisin" right now, make the, make up their mind to go.  I think it helped Puffy decide that this might be something for me cause he was, he was a big fan.  You know, everybody in New York, you know, they went to see it at one time or another and had their minds blown and were, were--many, many people were exposed to a Broadway house for the first time.  Not many people that live in New York, how many African Americans, go to 42nd Street area and walk past those theaters and never even have the slightest inkling of ever going in one, no matter what is on the marquee.  Well, now you can believe with Puffy, with, with P Diddy or Sean Combs and Felicia Rashad and Sanaa Lathan and, and Audra McDonald, people are paying to that.  And there's gonna be people in that theater paying those huge ticket prices that, who have never been in a Broadway house before, screaming and jumping to their feet with standing ovations and so forth.  And we believe that we probably helped just pave the way a little bit.
Story_ID: 9935
Speaker 1: Now, that's--what does Stan Lathan want to do now, you know, because people look at you and they're like, he's always current.  You know, I mean, you know, you act like, okay, well, Russell [Simmons] and I were hanging out in the same crowd together.  But I mean, you know, but you were older than he, you know, and I mean, but you always have been, you know, whether it was, you know, "Say Brother" to, you know, the dance thing, to "Sesame Street," you know, to--you've been there.  And so that's what people say, you know, if something is happening, Stan Lathan is there.  So I'm just saying, you know, you haven't gotten older, you haven't, like become passé.  (Laughs)
Speaker 2: That's true.  I mean, I mean, you know what, I sometimes, I wonder, you know, I, I marvel at that.  I think that I'm really blessed.  I really believe that, I haven't been obsessed with staying young or staying, you know, or worrying about staying, keeping up with, with whatever is going on.  You know, Russell and I have, have been partners for fifteen years, but even beyond that, I--if I had never met Russell, I still would have directed, you know, the, the pilot I just did ['Second Time Around'] with Boris Kodjoe and, and Nicole [Ari] Parker who are gonna be huge stars.  I still would have directed "All of Us" with Will [Smith] and Jada [Pinkett-Smith] and, producing and, and the cast, the great cast that they have.  And, and 'Eve', the show with Eve.  It's starring, you know starring Eve, and those shows are gonna, are on the air now.  And I think it's just because I--it, I don't know if I talked about this the first time, but that I always felt like, I was always the guy that did this, you know, that said, I'll, I'll try that, you know, and didn't hesitate.  I have this feeling, that I was born to kind of direct and to, to be in charge to a certain extent, say to a certain extent.  And I, and I say, and so that, and that's why I think it grew to, to--from being a director to being a producer and being more in control of the work.  So when, so when you say, "what does Stan Lathan want to do?," well, you know, I want to, I want to help other directors.  And I want to, and I--there's a, you know, if you look around at the entertainment industry now, there's a lot of African American directors that I've, you know, that I've had some kind of involvement with.  And--
Speaker 1: Can you give some of their names?
Speaker 2: Sure, Gina Prince-Bythewood who did, who directed "Disappearing Acts" and "Love and Basketball," Reggie Bythewood  who just directed "Biker Boyz," and up--you know, a really strong, up and coming director. Tim Story, who did the original "Soul Food" and, you know, I'm friends with F. Gary Gray and John Singleton.  We helped him get--helped, actually helped him sell "Boyz N' The Hood," Russell and I.  Bret Ratner is a, a close friend and sort of someone that, you know, we've given--I've given advice to over the years.  He's the director of both "Rush Hours" and "Red Dragon" and films like that.  And there are others, there're, you know, several in the, that are actually doing television now.  So, but beyond that, I'm not hanging up my directing, my directing shoes so to speak.  However, I do believe that the next logical step is to, now that we're starting to own more and more material, more and more of the things that we do, all of the things that we do, actually, is to now find ways to get, you know, into the ownership of the ability to distribute and disseminate them.  So in the next couple of years you'll see the Simmons-Lathan Entertainment or Simmons-Lathan Media Group will be much more of a presence in cable television, not just as a little name you see at the end, but actually controlling some of the, the, you know, the, the airways, so to speak; being able to--I want to start that again.  Okay, because this is important.  So in the next couple years, you'll begin to see Simmons-Lathan become more of a presence in cable television.  We'll actually have real estate that'll be branded, "Def on Demand," which will deliver great programming to our audience and that we'll control.  We're trying more and more to, you know, to have control of the material, control of the way we produce it, control of the way we deliver it.  And hopefully, as my career, you know, develops and I start to grow up and really start to achieve some things, then that'll become more, that'll become larger and, and more effective and more important in, in the communications industry.
Speaker 1: You sound excited about this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I'm very excited.  I'm very excited about what is front of me right now.  I'm very excited about the fact that my partner, Russell, has grown into a, a very powerful man in the, in the, in--not only in entertainment, but in communications.  And he's starting to, you know, to really become a force in politics.  He's socially active, and I'm proud to be a part of his, of his, of his business life.  We have a firm commitment to, to make some changes in the entertainment industry, changes that are, you know, help to, you know, benefit, you know, many of our colleagues and also our audience.
Speaker 1: So you think that, you think that the two of you have the potential to sort of have ownership, that has eluded black people, you know, in this industry.
Speaker 2: Not only, we don't, we not only have the potential of ownership.  We, we have ownership now of much--
Speaker 1: I'm talking about the distribution, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, well, not only, not only do we have ownership, but we will control distribution to a certain extent, I mean to as much as you can.  I mean there's still delivery systems exist in the hands of the mul--major multinational corporation.  We can't do it without them on the level that we would like to do it unless we were out on the street selling DVDs, which we're, which we're not, you know, opposed to doing.  But we will absolutely, have control over how our material reaches our audience.  And it will be on a major scale.  And this is one of the things that we're really working towards right now.

Speaker 1: Now, you just--two other quick questions, your daughter, Sanae, she is--
Speaker 2: Sanaa.
Speaker 1: Sanaa, sorry.  Sanaa, sorry--has had tremendous success.  Have you played a part in that?
Speaker 2: Only--
Speaker 1: Or is that--
Speaker 2: I think that Sanaa has, her success has, is not something that just happened.  You know, her mother is an extraordinary dancer and actress and teacher.  And she grew up, you know, around me and, and the business that I'm in.  And she, you know, spend many time--much time on sets and so forth.  She was surrounded, as a, as a small child on the, on, you know, with, shows like "The Wiz" on Broadway and "Timbuktu" and, and--because her mother was a Broadway performer.  So she's kind of got it in her blood.  So when she went to [University of California] Berkeley [Berkeley, California] as an undergraduate, she was committed and decided about what she wanted to do.  And I had always steered my kids away from acting because I believed that, you know, there's a ceiling for, for African American actors and actresses, especially.  But when it came time for her to graduate and to move on, you know, she, she--we knew she could get into law school.  She thought about entertainment law.  She knew she wanted to be in the entertainment business.  I was, you know, hoping that she would be a, you know, that she would eventually be a producer or director because she's very talented, obviously--I mean she was, I--it was obvious to me because of things she had done in college.  And then she auditioned and was accepted at Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] and NYU [New York University, New York, New York] for graduate school.  And, you know, Yale [School of] Drama is this hugely difficult place to get into.  And they accepted her and offered her money and all of that.  So I actually had to acquiesce.  And then I started going up to all of her--I went to up to all of her productions and I was, you know, soon aware of the fact that this is what she was born to do.  She certainly feels that, and she's proven it by the, you know, the kinds of rolls that she's gotten, the fact that she's been very selective about what she'd--about the offers that she's accepted.  She's been offered many, many things that she's passed on.  And I think she's made the right choices.  And now, it's, you know, she's on Broadway, and she's got movies coming out and, and offers that are, for better things.  So I think that my involvement was kind of a life-long kind of role model as, along with her mom.  And then we talked often about the work and the things that were in front of her, but she's pretty much in charge of her own destiny, and takes that responsibility.  And I've given her advice and she hasn't taken it, so--and she was right (laughter).  It's prove--it's come to prove that she was right.

Speaker 1: What do I want my legacy to be?  I don't know.  I don't know how to answer that.
Speaker 2: What do you want to be remembered for?
Speaker 1: I think I want to be remembered for, you know, having--I think I want to be remembered for having made a positive contribution as an artist and as a producer to African Americans and African American culture.  I think that ultimately, all of the stuff that I do has some sort of crossover potential, I guess, but since the beginning of my career, it's been about being black and being proud to be black, and, you know, and wanting my family, who are all black people, to--and I'm not just talking about kids.  I'm talking about my family.  It was always this thing about Stan is the, you know, is the one we're proud of.  We see his name on television, you know, and we love what he does.  And, and that's what I want to be remembered for, for, for, you know, having, just dedicated my work and my life and, you know, to not only make, building business--a strong business and making money, but, you know, having done positive material for black people.
