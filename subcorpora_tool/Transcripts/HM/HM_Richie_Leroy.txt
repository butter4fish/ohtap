Speaker 1: I'd like to start out by asking about your mother.  If you could give her name and what you know about her family and her growing up?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Julia Allen.  I never knew her as Julia because she took her mother's name, Mattie Allen.  And I always knew her as Mattie Allen.  She has a brother--she had a brother, had two brothers, one Sebia and one Buster.  Her mother died when she was very young.  She was raised by her father and her aunt, her father's sister in Macon, Georgia.  Her brother Buster died in prison in Cleveland, Ohio.  And her brother, Sebia, was in Buffalo [New York] with her and lived until he died there.
Speaker 1: Do you--how did the family go from Macon to Buffalo--
Speaker 2: Buffalo?
Speaker 1: Buffalo, yes?  Do you know any of that story?
Speaker 2: I do not know that story.  I believe my mother was brought to Buffalo by my father [Leroy Richie, Sr.].  I believe he married her and brought her to Buffalo.
Speaker 1: Now did she--was she a talkative person, sir, and, you know, did she talk any about, you know, growing up or any of--
Speaker 2: Just a very little.  She never talked about--she, she did not enjoy the South.  And she never let my brother and I go south.  We, we, I didn't go south until I joined the service, and I went to Kentucky.  I'd never been south when I was nineteen and joined the Service.  I do know that when she was sixteen, she had her own car.  Her father had a, a block of houses and a store that he lost in the, in the Depression.  She never drove because she turned over her car at sixteen, and she would never drive after that.  That's all I know about her, her, her family.  I didn't know--I know her mother was, was half Indian.  I never knew anything about her father.
Speaker 1: What kind of person would you describe her as though?
Speaker 2: She was friendly.  She was a homemaker.  She stayed home and raised us.  She laughed at my father's jokes.  She was a very kind person.  She was short, she was five [feet] four [inches].  And she finally had a daughter, and that was the love of her life, the light of her life.  And my sister [Arlene Richie Dixon] is just, you know, she benefited from being the light in my mother's eyes (laughs).

Speaker 1: Your father, can you talk about him 'cause--are you a Junior?  I didn't--
Speaker 2: I'm a Junior, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Can you talk about your father [Leroy Richie, Sr.] and what you know, you know, similarly on his side?
Speaker 2: My father was a Pullman porter.  And actually, he's in the book that was written about Pullman porters, the name of which escapes me at the moment.  I'll think of it and put it on the, put it on during the interview.  He, he was a tall man.  He was six [feet] one [inch].  He was, his family was from Hamlet, North Carolina, and he landed in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  And he came to Buffalo [New York] from Pittsburgh.  I suspect it was on the railroad, and that's where the railroad, the New York Central [Railroad], one of its major stops.  And he, he landed there, and made his home there.  He was a formal man.  He was, he was dark brown skinned, and my mother [Mattie Allen Richie] was very, very light, exceptionally light.  And at the time, the way you identified yourself as, as important in the black community was you married the lightest woman you could find, and that's what he did.  And he and my brother, my--I have a brother [Peter Richie]--I had a brother a year younger.  And they were very, very good friends.  I mean they used to go drinking together and, and my, and I was never permitted to drink with my father.  He, he would always order me a Coke (laugher).  And he and Pete would, would drink together.  We were good friends though, my father and I.  And he visited me often when we were in--when I lived in New York.
Speaker 1: Now, did he--was he, did he share any stories about growing up or being a Pullman porter?  Were you, you know, aware of that part, you know, besides him traveling?
Speaker 2: I was not actually.  He did not share stories, but I knew his family because every vacation we ever took was to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to, to visit his family.  So I'm very close with that side of my, of my family.  I have many, many cousins, and they--we, we share time together.  And I remember my, my paternal grandmother and grandfather and his sisters and brothers.  He had eleven brothers and sisters.  And--
Speaker 1: Did they work in the steel and coal mining, in the mills there or do you know?
Speaker 2: They did not.
Speaker 1: They did not?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, no.  My father was a Pullman porter.  His, the brother next to him, Marion, was a--owned real estate, owned and managed real estate in Moon Crest Village, which is right outside of Pittsburgh.  His father worked in a building.  I think he was a porter in a building in, in Pittsburgh.  None of them were in the, were in the steel mill or the, or the coal mines in Pittsburgh.

Speaker 2: I have, I had one brother.  And he died in '92 [1992].  And I have a sister.

Speaker 2: Yes, my brother is named Peter Allen Richie.  He was born October 15, 1942.  And my sister is Arlene Faye Richie or Arlene Faye Dixon now.  She was born December 15, 1949.
Story_ID: 19426
Speaker 1: What was your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sitting, after my, my--my earliest memory currently of, of growing up was, was my mother [Mattie Allen Richie]used to invite us to--my brother [Peter Richie] and I, to get in bed with her and listen to the radio.  And I remember doing that when my sister [Arlene Richie Dixon] was two years old.  And it was a Saturday night, and my mother was looking at, looking up at the closet where she had all my sister's dresses.  And she was shaking her head, and there were at least eleven or twelve freshly ironed dresses on the, on the, the extension from the closet.  And my mother looked, and she said, "Faye has nothing to wear to church tomorrow morning."  And I will never forget that.  The other very vivid memory I have as I walked in the house one day, my mother had decided that her boys were growing up.  And so she used to put--she worked at, as a hat check girl in one of the restaurants in town.  And she got tips.  And she used to put money in a box, and she would leave it for us so that when we came home from school, she would, we could take--if we needed money, we could take it out.  And we'd have to write a note what the money was for.  We could take a quarter or a dime and go to the store and do whatever we needed to do.  But it was a way of--we were ten or eleven years old.  And it was a way of, of helping us to grow into adults, I guess.  And I walked in one day, and my mother was literally curled up in a corner crying on the floor.  And I walked over, and I, I said, "Mom, what's, what's wrong?"  And she looked up, and she was laughing.  And I said, "What, what is wrong?"  And she, she pointed to the box.  And I looked at the box, and it was empty.  This was the third day that the box had been there.  And it was empty.  And all the money had been taken by my brother, and he had misspelled the word "miscellaneous" (laughter) on the note that he left in the box.  And she lost it (laughter).  I do remember that.  The other memory I have is, is my mother and father [Leroy Richie, Sr.] used to have card parties.  And, and we--my brother and I used to sneak down the hall, okay, to try to listen to what was happening at the card party after we were, after we went to bed at night.  And I remember my father, he, he and my mother had a fight.  And he wouldn't, he never touched her.  He just stood there.  And she was so angry at him that she grabbed him, and when she grabbed, he had a t-shirt on, an undershirt, one of the classic undershirts, you know, the string undershirts, and she ripped it.  She ripped his undershirt.  Okay, she was so angry.  She ripped his undershirt.  And he took the undershirt off, and he, he calmed her down and everything was okay.  But for at least a year after that, every time they had a party, he would explain how his wife abused him, and he'd bring out that undershirt and show people the undershirt (laughter).  And, and I remember him doing that.  And everybody was just dying laughing.  And I remember the next day, my mother made us help her look for that damned undershirt (laughter).  She was gonna find that undershirt and get rid of it.  (laughter)  I do remember that.

Speaker 1: Do you know how your parents, how they ended up in Buffalo [New York]?  I mean I know you said, he--were they, as newlyweds, they moved to Buffalo?
Speaker 2: He [Leroy Richie, Sr.] moved to Buffalo because of his job because of the railroad.  He ran out of Buffalo.  He ran on the New York Central, out of Buffalo.  And so he moved there from Pittsburgh, and I think he brought her [Mattie Allen Richie] there.
Speaker 1: Now, what was, what street did you live on and what was your, you know, your community that grew up in like?
Speaker 2: I lived on Purdy Street.  It was in Coal Spring in Buffalo.  It was 287 Purdy Street.  It was, it was an African American community, and the--I, I remember it well because one of my views is that we have been hurt in a very fundamental way by integration.  When we lived--when I lived on Buffalo, the, the man who lived across the street from me was a dentist.  Okay, the, the neighborhood lawyer lived three doors down.  His name was Hezekiah Curtis.  I will never forget him.  A school teacher lived on the block.  The pharmacist lived on the block because I used to work for them, you know, as a, as a child.  In other words, it, it was a fully-contained community that was very economically diverse.  It was not racially diverse, but it was economically diverse.  And I had an opportunity to see how various professional men acted and I could choose what I wanted to be, okay.  Now, we live in very, very racially diverse communities, at least middle-class African Americans do, but they're very economically--they lack diversity in economics.  And, and what happens in the inner cities is that, you know, our, our children have no role models.
Speaker 1: Well, let's take ourselves back to Purdy Street, and I'd like you to just sort of remember what, like sights, smells, you know, and sounds remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: There was a community center across the street when we were--well, I don't know.  I was old enough to go--I couldn't cross the street, but I could go play on the sidewalk all the way to the end of the block, okay.  And I remember I could go to the community center, which meant I could go--it was on the other side of the street, but I could go to the front of the community, to the street across from the community center.  And the director could come across and get me.  And I remember doing that every summer.  I had to take a nap from one to two o'clock.  And I never wanted to sleep.  But I always did sleep.  But I would play at the community center.  I remember being popular, but not being a leader.  I remember thinking that I, that I enjoyed my, my childhood, that it was, it was a peaceful time, you know.  And I, I got in a couple of fights, but I had a younger brother [Peter Richie] who was, who was very, very bad.  And he was the kind of fellow that mothers told their boys, I don't want you to be around him (laughter).  And so, he, he protected me.  He was a year younger than I was, but he used to, he did all of our fighting.  I remember when Fish chased me home.  And I ran up on the porch, and Pete ran up behind and hit him with a stick (laughter) and knocked him down.  And those are my memories.
Speaker 1: How about any smells that remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Greens, greens, black-eyed peas, fried chicken.  Every Sunday, we had fried chicken, every Sunday we had fried chicken.  It was, it was a tradition.  And my mother would cook it.  She actually cooked two chickens.  One she'd hide because the one that she left out, we'd all steal pieces of chicken and there would be nothing left at dinner time.  So she had one hidden that she'd bring out.  And we'd have dinner.  And I all--I do remember, whenever my father was there, but he always got fed first.  She would pass him each bowl of food, and he would take what he wanted.  And then the rest of us could, could eat.  But he always got fed first.
Speaker 1: Any sounds?
Speaker 2: None come to mind, none, none were--none of the sounds were remarkable.
Speaker 1: Was there a lot of radio listening in your--you know, you had mentioned at one time--
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, there was a lot of radio listening in our home.  But it was, it was an incredibly poor home.  I mean the house I grew up in, we used to leave for three months in the winter because the pipes burst.  And we couldn't, we couldn't stay there.  And we'd--I'd go and live with one aunt and my mother--and my brother would go and live with another aunt.  And my mother and sister would go and live with a third aunt.  And we used to have to do that--I can remember, we, we were very poor.  I can remember sitting down with my mother with, with seven dollars and having one of those accordion day things and with a dollar in each day and trying to figure out how we were gonna eat for a dollar a day.  And what was it, brown, brown apple jelly.  We used to eat apple jelly and bread for dinner sometimes.  Yeah, no, we were very, we, we grew up very poor.  In fact, I remember one game that my brother and I used to play that we used to close our bathroom door and turn the light out.  And then we'd open the door, turn the light on and one of us would go in to see how many roaches we could kill.  And then we'd--the other one would go, and we'd compete with how many roaches we could kill.  Before my mother moved, she left my father and moved the family--and moved her kids.  And, but before she moved, we used to have to use an umbrella when we went and sat on toilet to make sure that the--because there was a hole in the ceiling and the toilet upstairs would leak.  Yeah, it was a bad--and we had to close off one room because the rats invaded it.  And we had these huge rats in the, in the back of the, in the backyard.  We never played in our backyard, never played, never played on our back porch because we were--the rats would, you know, we were concerned about, about--we were afraid of the rats.  I'm still today deathly afraid of a rat.  I can't watch movies with rats in them.  If I, if I, if, if a movie comes on with a rat in it, I just turn the movie off.  I just won't watch it.
Story_ID: 19428
Speaker 1: Were you aware or were you a typical older, you know, oldest child?  And did you--and when I say, were you the one who had to be responsible?  Was that--
Speaker 2: I was the one that had to be responsible.  I was the one that did well in school and I, I always thought that my parents were, they lacked the sophistication necessary to help my brother [Peter Richie] adjust to that.  And he picked other ways of demonstrating, you know, his, his, of acting out because I took up school as my, as my, as my thing.  And so he didn't.  And I always thought that it was in reaction to, you know, your brother's doing so well in school.  Why don't you?  And he just did something else.  My, my brother was a, was a criminal (laughs), most of his life.
Speaker 1: So as a middle child, he had trouble finding his way is what you're saying.
Speaker 2: He had, he--no, he didn't have any trouble finding his way.  He just wasn't--we just weren't thrilled with the way he found.  And then when my sister [Arlene Richie Dixon] came along, she competed with him directly.  And, and it didn't bother me that all of my mother's [Mattie Allen Richie] and father's [Leroy Richie, Sr.] attention went to her, every bit of it went to her.
Speaker 1: And that didn't make you feel, you know, like a lot--cause she was six years--
Speaker 2: Eight.
Speaker 1: Eight years younger than you.  Okay, but that didn't bother you at all?
Speaker 2: No, not at all, no.  I, I understood it.  I was old enough, and, you know, I wasn't used to the younger child attention.  My brother, apparently was, okay.  And he, that's what he lost, all right.  And he never really got along with my, with my sister, you know.  And I just replaced my father with, with my sister.  I'd taken care of her all of her life.
Story_ID: 19429
Speaker 1: Where did you go to elementary school?
Speaker 2: Public School Number 17.  Buffalo, New York.
Speaker 1: Oh, so they have that in Buffalo too, the public schools.  I just think of that as New York, you know.
Speaker 2: Oh, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Public School Number 17.
Speaker 1: And do you, do you remember any of your teachers there?
Speaker 2: Mrs. McDonald was my first grade teacher, and I, I remember my second grade teacher.  I don't remember her name.  I remember Mrs. McDonald because I got in more trouble one day.  I walked home from school and when I went in the house, Mrs. McDonald was laying on the couch in the living room crying.  And my mother [Mattie Allen Richie] and father [Leroy Richie, Sr.] were ministering to her, okay.  And she was crying because I had acted so badly in school.  She, she lost it.  And so she came home to tell my parents (laughter).  And I (laughter), and this was in the era before Dr. Seuss said you couldn't use corporal punishment with your children.  And so my father literally beat the hell out of me (laughter).  And I knew it was coming.  I mean I, it, it meant all my expectations when I saw her there.
Story_ID: 19430
Speaker 1: Were you a mischievous child because it doesn't seem like you would--but were you mischievous?  Were you acting out at that age or were you--
Speaker 2: I never did act out.  I was never mischievous.  I just--there were times, three or four times in my life when I did things that I wasn't supposed to.  But no, I, I've never acted out.  I left all that, all of that to my brother [Peter Richie].  He, he did enough for both of us.
Speaker 1: But what type of child were you, would you--how would you describe yourself?
Speaker 2: I was a member of a gang called the El Torianos.  It was one of the biggest gangs in, in Buffalo.  It was a, it was notorious gang.  My role in the gang was as the gang's lawyer (laughter).  I was not expected to fight.  But I was expected to go to the principal of the grade school and the high school and arrange for gang members to get back in class or to get back in school when they needed it.  That was my role.
Speaker 1: Wait, are you saying that everyone in the neighborhood had to be part of gangs?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no.
Speaker 1: No, so you, okay.
Speaker 2: No, but they asked me to join the gang for this, to perform this role (laughter).  And I did (laughter).  My wife [Julia Thomas Richie], my wife dies when I start talking about being a member of a gang because I didn't explain to her when I initially told her that I was a member of a gang that my role was simply to, to--
Speaker 1: To be the lawyer (laughter).
Story_ID: 19431
Speaker 1: You had mentioned Hezekiah Curtis, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you said that he was an interesting man, you know, and did he, is that the reason that you, you know, developed an interest in law at, you know--?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so.  I did develop an interest in law very early.  I lost it, and then when I was a senior in college, I, I reacquired that interest.  But, no, I just, I mentioned Curt because I liked him, because he gave me my first pen because I used to run in and out of his house because he had a very interesting relationship with, with Ruth Miller, who was one of my, my mother's good friends and who--she lived with, with Curt.  And he, he made the money that supported her.  She had been married to a man who lived around the corner, who had caught her with another man who lived across the street, who was our Scout Master.  And he pushed her down the stairs, and she ended up walking on crutches and she had no place to go and so Curt, Curt took her in and cared for her--.
Story_ID: 19432
Speaker 1: I mean I simply had no choice.  And my brother [Peter Richie] did.  But I did not have a choice.  And I went right to, right to college.  It didn't last very long, but I went right to college.
Speaker 2: But what I'm trying to understand is during your, you know, formative years, you know, from the time you, you know, enter elementary school to the time you graduate, I'm just trying to see what sort of significant, you know, or if you can share some other memories, you know, of growing up and things that, you know, influenced it, really, you know.  And I'm just trying to understand, you know, what you were like as a young child.
Speaker 1: Boy, I don't remember.  I was, I think I was fairly nondescript.  I mean I just--it, it, I think back a lot because for most of my adult life, I've been fairly driven.  And I haven't been able to figure out why I was that driven.  I grew up in an incredibly poor environment, but we never even--I don't know that welfare was available at that point.  I think it was.  But we never even thought about it.  My mother [Mattie Allen Richie] simply had too much pride, you know.  And I, I--it just, it, I--it never--I've never been able to figure out where it came from.
Speaker 2: Would you say, were there any subjects that you were particularly, you know, that you gravitated to?
Speaker 1: English and history.
Speaker 2: And why?
Speaker 1: I enjoyed, I enjoyed writing, and I enjoyed memorizing dates and remember dates.  And I was, I was good at, at both of those.
Speaker 2: Were there--were you a reader of comic books, were you, you know, into sports?  I'm just trying to--
Speaker 1: I played basketball, but I wasn't, I wasn't a superstar.  I was a reader of comic books, although I didn't read my first book until I was seventeen.  I mean I was seventeen when I read--I, I remember being thrilled that I read--finally finished and read a book.  So it really, I--the, the one incident I remember where I acted out was, was--let me two when I was in high school.
Speaker 2: Now, where did you go to high school?
Speaker 1: Lafayette High School in Buffalo, New York.
Speaker 2: Was that, now, your PS, was it seventeen [Public School 17, Buffalo, New York], you said?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: PS-17, was that primarily the--was it a mixed population or primarily black?
Speaker 1: It was--
Speaker 2: Were the teachers white?  I'm just--
Speaker 1: The teachers were white.  It was practically all black.  We had a few white students, but primarily black.  Lafayette was an Italian high school and with a few blacks.  I mean 25 percent of the population was black.
Story_ID: 19433
Speaker 1: When I was thirteen years old, I took the bus home.  And when it got to Jefferson [Avenue] and Ferry Street [Buffalo, New York], I walked off the bus, and I took a, a water pistol.  I pointed it at the bus driver.  I said, "So long, sucker."  And I squirted him in the face with that water pistol, several times.  And we all jumped off the bus and ran, okay.  What I didn't know at the time was he thought that someone had put acid in his face.  And he jumped off the bus and just, I mean crawled around, you know, until he realized he was okay (laughs).  But it showed up in the headlines the next, the next morning in the paper, "Bus Driver Shot in Face", you know, by "By Student".  And they name me 'cause they didn't know me at the time, but they--the police figured out who I was and, and by Sunday, they had identified me.  And they came to the house and got me, and I was suspended from school and arrested and the whole, the whole bit.  And I remember Abraham Axelrod, J. W. Hays was the assistant principal and Abraham Axelrod was the principal of the high school [Lafayette High School, Buffalo, New York].  And he was out that Monday.  He got back to school Tuesday morning, okay, heard what had happened and--and immediately reversed my suspension and said, "This is silly," you know.  Tell them--I must have--I was fourteen, not thirteen when this happened.  He said--and he called me up, called, called up my parents and said "Bring him back to school."  And I went back to school.  Now--and because I had never gotten in trouble before, and I mean it was, and I, it was water that I used.  It was just a--you know, a gross misunderstanding.  And no record was ever made, I mean even of the arrest.  So that was, that was okay.  I remember that because one of the most significant and character-defining events--it probably was nothing, but occurred the day that Abraham Axelrod died, the day after.  He died one evening in his sleep, and we were informed by radio the next morning that he had died.  I was sixteen or seventeen years old.  And I, I remember getting on the school bus that morning, and everyone on the bus--it was all black, on its way to Lafayette High School, everyone on the bus was congratulating themselves because Axelrod had died because he was such a mean son of a bitch, you know.  And they just, they were just as happy as they could be.  And I remember joining that celebration, okay, and just laughing and whoa, you know, we're free, we're free.  This turkey's dead, and we're, you know, and I got to the back of the bus.  And I sat there, and I thought about the things that Axelrod had done for me.  And I have never felt that bad--I've never felt as bad as I did then since.  It just, it--I, I, you know, I, I, I cannot tell you how awful I felt.  I got off the bus and walked to school.  I just got right off the bus.  I, I couldn't handle having been that duplicitous (laughs).  And, and because he was a good friend.  And he, he, you know, if, if he hadn't what he, what he did, my life might be completely different.  I mean it just--because this was a big thing.  I mean this was, not only the head, the headlines on Sun--on Saturday, but on Sunday, the headlines were still, you know, "Bus Driver", you know, "Shot in Face".  They neglected to say it was just water.  So I, I just--it was a character-defining moment for me because I swore I would never let that happen to me again.  I would never be that duplicitous and I don't think I ever have.  I've done a lot of other things.  Just ask my wife [Julia Thomas Richie], but that's not one of them.
Speaker 2: So when you were arrested, did that have any impact on you or were there any, you know, fear or was it, you know, was it youthful, and you weren't really impacted?
Speaker 1: I, I was, I wasn't, I wasn't impacted, no.
Story_ID: 19434
Speaker 1: You had said that, you know, you had an interest in law early on, and then it went away.  And I'm wondering, are we talking about during your high school years or later?
Speaker 2: When I was a senior in high school, I wanted to be a lawyer.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: I just liked to talk.  I used to play a game where you had to be able to speak on any subject for sixty seconds.  And anyone in the room could define the subject, and you had to begin immediately speaking on that subject and speak continuously on that subject for sixty seconds.  It was a game we used to play.  And I used to always win.  I could speak on any subject sixty seconds, you know, and just go on and on and on.  And I guess people told me that that was a--I sounded like a lawyer.  And I just began to see myself as a lawyer, and I wanted to be a lawyer.
Speaker 1: And so was it Hezekiah [Curtis] who was your image of a lawyer or were there other, you know, did you have contact with other lawyers or?
Speaker 2: I guess it was Hezekiah that, that formed my image of a lawyer.  He was, yeah, he was formal, and he was--yeah, I guess that's right.

Speaker 1: In high school were there other thing that, you know, were you a part of the--were you part of school activities?  Were you part of the debate team, you know, were your grades, you know--?
Speaker 2: I remember two things from high school.  One was when I was a senior in high school [at Lafayette High School, Buffalo, New York], my English teacher sent a note to my mother [Mattie Allen Richie] that I was not going to graduate because of--I was going to fail English.  And my mother came to school the next morning and we were in English class.  And she invited my mother into the class, and my mother stood there, in front of the class, and said, "What can I do?"  This was March of my senior year, and what can I do to--my son must graduate.  Please tell me what I can do?  And the teacher said, "Nothing.  There's nothing you can do.  I'm sorry."  And my mother said, "You old biddy" and walked out.  And it broke up the class.  It literally broke up the class.  I was so proud of her.  I, and she couldn't fail me, and--she couldn't fail me.  And she knew it, and she was angry about it.  And I graduated fourth in my high school class.  And so, I, I always--that was the other thing I remember, that had I known then what I know now, I would have graduated first.  I just didn't work hard.  And I graduated fourth.  And it, it always disturbed me that I, that I was fourth because there wasn't a point difference between the, the four of us, not a point difference.  It was, you know, percentages of a point difference in our grades.  I mean one different grade and I would have graduated first, and I--so you know what I did?  I did graduate first in college (laughs).
Speaker 1: I saw that valedictorian there.  I want to ask were you a good student from the time that you entered school or did that sort of--was there a time that you went from an average student to a good student?
Speaker 2: I was always a good student.
Speaker 1: From the beginning?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It always came easy for me, and I never, I never had to work at it.  The only--I had to work in law school, but I never.  No, I'm--I was never an average student.  There was no epiphany that made me a good student.  It just, it just happened.
Speaker 1: Was that congratulated at home, you know, your grades?
Speaker 2: It was expected.  I, I can remember when I was in second grade I came home with a C, and the C had been--something had been erased and the C had replaced it because I was acting up in, in assembly.  And my brother [Peter Richie] came home with all D's and one C.  And he was congratulated for getting the C.  I came home with all A's and one C and I was punished because I got the C.
Speaker 1: What was pushing you on?  That's what I'm trying to understand.  I'm trying to--or just it all came easy, but you-
Speaker 2: It, it really--
Speaker 1: It all came easy.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it really came easy.
Speaker 1: Were you an internal thinker?  Were you a person who sort of lived inside your mind in any way?
Speaker 2: (nods for yes) Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And what were some of the things you would think about?
Speaker 2: When the world would end.  How big the universe was.  Whether there really was a God, you know, whether we lived--one of the thoughts I've never been able to get rid of is, is after I, after I became familiar with 'Gulliver's Travels', whether we live in a, whether the whole world exists inside of a bubble, you know, a, a drop of water.  And whether there're, you know, whether we are one drop of water (laughs), you know, and, and how big the universe is.  I used to cry about that.  How long we were gonna live.  Lots of questions.
Speaker 1: Those are pretty, you know, serious thoughts for a young person.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, they are.  My daughter used to have them too, my youngest daughter [Darcy Richie] used to--I used to have to talk her to sleep at night 'cause she couldn't--she'd cry.  She couldn't figure it out.  You know, but I remember having those, having those thoughts and just not being able to, to come to grips with, with that.  Why people use different languages?  How that happened?  Why, why are there different languages?  I just couldn't, couldn't get it.
Story_ID: 19436
Speaker 1: You mentioned the community center.  Did you--was that a, the community center across the street, was that important to your growing up?  Were you on the Boy Scouts?  Were you--
Speaker 2: I was in the Boy Scouts.  That was probably more important, and Freddie Anderson was our, was our scout leader.  And Ruth Miller was responsible for me going to the Episcopal church.  My mother [Mattie Allen Richie] never went to church, but Ruth took us, took us to church every Sunday.  And we'd go to the Episcopal church.  That's where Freddie was the scoutmaster.  And Freddie lived across the street from, from--I can't think of Miller's first name.  And I noticed one day that Ruth Miller and, Ms. Miller and you had the same last names.  And I wondered why?  And my father [Leroy Richie, Sr.] told me.  He told me the whole story.  And my mother was devastated that my father would tell me that story about her friends (laughs).
Speaker 1: Because they were, it was an illicit relationship?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, what, did your mother leave your father?  Was that when you were--were you young?
Speaker 2: I was fourteen.
Speaker 1: Fourteen, okay. Did that have a, was that hard on you or was it because your father still was traveling a lot?
Speaker 2: My father was traveling a lot.  He came home, and his family had gone.  We moved four, five blocks away to Glenwood Avenue [Buffalo, New York].  And my father moved right around the corner.  He left the house and moved right around the corner.  I always resented the fact that, that my father moved so close.  I was entitled to a divorced parent relationship because there the father wants to do more for his kids, okay.  My father, whenever my mother went out anywhere--she had bridge meetings or bridge lovers' meetings or book lovers' meetings.  And he'd come over to babysit, you know, and, and, and they'd, they'd continue to argue about money, you know.  And my brother [Peter Richie] and sister [Arlene Richie Dixon] and I would sit there and watch.  And it was so funny.  It was the funniest thing 'cause my father was a natural comedian.  And whenever, whenever--even after they split, my mother was an extremely good-looking woman.  And so men would come over to visit her.  And my father would drift around the corner (laughs), and sit on the porch.  He'd sit on the porch (laughs) with my mother sitting in the living room with one of her friends.  (laughs)  And they're sitting there, and he'd sit on the porch and he'd knock on the window, "Hi, Jim, how are ya?" (laughs)  And my mother was outraged, and just outraged.  And, and the guy would eventually get so embarrassed he'd leave, you know.  And my father would come in house, and my mother would laugh (laughs).  And the week she died, he called me.  I was in, living in New York at the time, and he said, "Roy, you'd better come home.  We, we're bringing Mattie home from the, from the hospital."  And I said, "Okay, Dad, I'll be there tomorrow."  He said, "Well, you'd better come tonight."  And I said, "Okay."  And I did, and I got to spend the evening with my mother in the hospital.  And we just talked.  And she died at five, five o'clock the next morning.  But that whole week when she came--she came home from the hospital and spent a week.  And then they put her back in the hospital that last day.  He moved back in with her to take care of her.
Speaker 1: How old were you when your mother passed away?
Speaker 2: Twenty-five.  Twenty-five, yeah.
Story_ID: 19437
Speaker 1: You graduate from high school, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And it's--you said it's assumed at that point that you would go on to--
Speaker 2: Going to college.
Speaker 1: And so what are you--what do you see as your options or what colleges are you looking at?
Speaker 2: Oh, just one, Buffalo State Teachers College [now Buffalo State College, Buffalo, New York].  And that's where I went.  I went to Buffalo State Teachers College.  I lasted a year, and they asked me to leave, at the end of my first year.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: Because I had achieved the lowest grade point index of any student that had ever attended the college.  I had taken two semesters of courses, and I had in twelve credit hours, you know, with--is it a twelve a semester or twelve a year?
Speaker 1: I think twelve a semester.
Speaker 2: I think twelve a semester.  So I had taken two semesters of twelve credit hours, and I had achieved one C minus in my career.  Everything else was D and F or E.
Speaker 1: Why, why the difference?
Speaker 2: I was having fun.  I was voted Most Popular Man on Campus.  There were girls.  I had a significant emotional event when I was a freshman in college because I had a girlfriend, okay.  One of my first legitimate girlfriends was from New York, okay.  She was white.  She wore all black, okay, and I--she was incredible.  And I took her home to meet my mother [Mattie Allen Richie].  And I knocked on the door.  And my mother wouldn't open the door.  I went to the window, and I looked in, and she was sitting in the living room.  And I said, "Mom, open the door".  And she said, "Nope".  And I said, "Why?"  She said, "Roy, this is not your house.  This is mine.  In your home, you can do what you want.  But in my home, white people don't come in here unless they're service people.  I do not entertain white people in my home."  I was devastated.  I, I didn't know what to do.  I did not know what to do.  I was eighteen years old.  I had lived with this woman for eighteen years, and I never knew that that was her view.  She never shared that with me.  And she never told me why except that her experience in the South was such that, two things occurred, that affected me.  One, she never let me go south or my brother [Peter Richie], and two, she never invited white people into her home unless they were service people.  She did not entertain--they would not be entertained by them--but she, and the third thing that was significant, she never shared that with me.  I, I never knew why she did that or shared in, it just wasn't a part of my life.  It was her life.  And she dealt with it, but it was not a part of mine.
Speaker 1: But this 1959?
Speaker 2: 1959.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 1959.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was actually, yeah, yeah.  This was actually 1960.
Speaker 1: Okay, but that's still, you know, interracial dating was still, I mean always still or had been taboo.  So was that just, I mean someone you met and you liked and--okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and she was from New York, and obviously avant-garde and, I mean, you know, her parents were, had sent her upstate to go to school.  And she was at Buffalo State Teachers College, and I was there, and, you know.  We met and, you know, and--
Speaker 1: So your mother is probably thinking, what did my boy do?
Speaker 2: That's right, my mother was just, she just--
Speaker 1: She was like, this is totally going the wrong way.
Speaker 2: Oh, boy.
Story_ID: 19438
Speaker 1: You fail [out of Buffalo State Teachers College his first year], and then what happens?  What are you doing at that point?  You go into the service?  No?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I worked in a pool room, okay.  I, I--they asked me to leave, leave school, okay.  And I left, and went to work in a pool room, racking balls in a pool room.  And then I joined the service.  And I went to Kentucky for my--Fort Knox, Kentucky for my basic training and Fort Gordon, Georgia for my military police training.  While I was in, the first day I was in Fort Gordon, Georgia, the first day--(pause)-- I, I was put out of the USO [United Service Organizations] office for being black.  And while I was there, I must have been put out of twenty-seven, twenty-eight places as a military man for being black.  It was just incredible in Augusta [Georgia].  We, I had a friend who was Italian.  And we used to, we used to go to different places.  And I mean he would introduce me as a superstar.  You know, we'd go to white places, and he'd introduce me as a superstar.  And I'd come in, and when they realized I wasn't a superstar, they'd put us both out (laughs).  And then we'd go home.  But I was put out of the USO office.  I was put out of a black shoeshine stand.  I mean it was incredible, you know.  And I understood why my mother [Mattie Allen Richie] never wanted me to go south.  It was hard for me to handle.  Then I was, then I was, then I went--I left Fort Gordon.  Then I went to Huntsville, Alabama, to Huntsville, to Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama.  And I, I had joined the service for two years, voluntary draftee for two years.  And so this was 1961, and it was in my second year 'cause by the time you get through all of the training your first year is pretty much shot.  So it's, it's in my second year that I went to, to Huntsville.  When I arrived at Huntsville, at the train station, this guy named John Backscheider (ph.), who was from Cincinnati, Ohio, he was white, he asked me, he said, "Look, let's share our cab."  Well, the cab wouldn't take us both.  And when we got to the, to the post, everything was okay.  But when we went into town, you know, you know what it was like there.  It was segregated.  Well, I had never encountered segregation.  I didn't know how to handle it.  And I, I remember there were sit-ins in Huntsville.  And I used to, I sat in once.  I, I remember sitting in at a lunch counter in uniform.  And the police came in, and they asked me to leave.  And I said, "No, I'm not--I don't think I will."  And my sergeant came in, you know, they called my sergeant, and he came in and asked me if I would, if I would please accompany him back to the post, that we, we'd get it dealt with.  And I, and I aloud said, "Yeah, I would."  Now, I need to tell you, as a military policeman, I had my gun with me.  And, you know, and it was fully loaded, and I, I was waiting for somebody to spit on me or do something like I had heard, you know.  And, and (laughs) I was fully prepared to shoot them, fully prepared to shoot them, okay.  And I wasn't alone.  I mean John was with me, three or four guys.  We were there together.  And we wouldn't leave the lunch counter, and our sergeant came in, and he understood exactly what was going on. And he, he said "Okay, let's see if we can't diffuse this situation." And he took us back to camp with us.

Speaker 1: So you were shipped off to Europe, where in Europe?
Speaker 2: I actually was stationed in Stuttgart [Germany].
Speaker 1: Did you like your Germany experience?  A lot of bases in Germany.
Speaker 2: A lot of places in Germany.  I, it--I learned German there. Ich habe da Deutsch gelernt.  And I've never forgotten it.  It was the most intense experience I've ever had.  There were a hundred of us.  We were sent to German language school.  It was three months long.  The first day they said, "If you speak a word of English during the next three months, you will be asked to leave the school.  If you speak a word of English, anytime within the next three months, and you are heard, you will be asked to leave the school.  We have cameras watching you.  If you speak it in your sleep, you will be asked to leave the school.  This is the last word of English you will hear for three months, for ninety days," they said.  And he said, "Take out your pencils and look, the word, toilet is"--and he gave us the German word for toilet.  Food, okay.  He gave us some very basic words.  He said, "Folks, that's it."  Welcome to the whatever German language it is, enjoy your experience.  And as he turned to walk out of the room, one of the guys said, "Wait."  Gone.  There were seventeen of us that graduated.  Everybody else, gone.
Speaker 1: Out of the hundred?
Speaker 2: Out of a hundred.  One word in English, and you were gone.
Speaker 1: Now, you said that was part of the, you know, CIC [Counter Intelligence Corps] and what was, what was CIC, and how were you chosen?
Speaker 2: Well, it was Counter Intelligence.  And, and I, I had been to, I had been to college, you know.  I had some college under my belt.  I guess I appeared fairly bright.  And they needed, you know, this was a time when the whole German, the whole European experience was to, was to keep the Russian hordes busy for eleven minutes while we, you know, got some more troops lined up to come to Europe.  It was a completely different psychological experience and so they took some of us in the military police and trained us to, to be ready.  I actually didn't have any counter intelligence assignments, you know, but to be ready for whatever, whatever came.  But that was a short time, and when I got there, I signed up for another year and stayed until '64 [1964].
Story_ID: 19440
Speaker 1: You said, you know, you had participated in the one, you know, sit-in.
Speaker 2: I did not perceive of myself as having participated in the Civil Rights Movement.  I, I was not doing that.  They just told me I couldn't eat there.  And I said, you know--
Speaker 1: But I'm just saying, when you came back, you know, to the States, I mean, first of all, that experience, in, you know, in Germany, did it change you at all or were there things from that experience that--or were you sort of isolated on the base?
Speaker 2: Well, I wasn't isolated on the base, but what was happening in America didn't affect me.  You're right.  I missed that, that whole, that whole part of it.  Yeah, I did miss that.
Speaker 1: Are there ways that you grew up, you know, in that, during the time in the service that--or things you learned that's, you know, stayed with you or have stayed with you the rest of your life?
Speaker 2: Not that I can, not that I can think of.  I don't attribute much to that except, I guess, I guess that whole--from '60 [1960] to '65 [1965], the, the one thing that happened--I went back to Buffalo in '64 [1964] and I actually wanted to go back to school.  And they still wouldn't let me in the school in Buffalo State Teachers College [now Buffalo State College].  And I'll tell you how I got in, back in school.  But I remember being in New York.  And when I got to New York, I had cousins living in New York so we, we started to talk immediately.  And I remember getting to know Malcolm X and seeing him and thinking what a wonderful human being he was and how significant he was.  And then remembering what I thought of him in Buffalo.  I thought he was lousy rabble rouser.  He was the worst thing he--that ever happened to black people in America.  And I--it, it just amazed me that I thought that.  And I became convinced that we needed our communication medium, that we needed our own newspaper because my mind was completely blown.  I mean what I thought of Malcolm X is what I was told to think of Malcolm X.  And I, I mean I hadn't, I wasn't particularly conservative.  In fact, I was, I was liberal.  I was, I was inclined, you know, toward, not radical, but certainly on the, on the left edge of liberal.  So how could I think what I thought of Malcolm X?  It had to be that that's all the input I was getting, I was given.  And it really did scare me.  But that's what I thought of him.  And when I got to New York, I mentioned this to my cousin, and whoa!  (laughs)  And they took me to hear him, and, and it was, it was--the difference was just phenomenal.  Anyway, I, when I, when I left the service, I went home.  And I went to work for Bethlehem Steel Company.  And there came a day when I was arrested in, in Williams Pool Room.  The police came in.  They searched my jacket.  They looked around, they search my jacket, felt it down, and said, "Is that yours?"  Nope because that they plant drugs in your jacket, and so you, I mean, you can't claim it 'cause if you claim it, you're going down.  So I didn't claim it, so they arrested me anyway.  They took me over to a police car on Chester Street around the corner and took me out of the police car in handcuffs behind my back.  We went up, and this woman said, "Yeah, that's him".  And they arrested me for armed robbery in the first degree, for robbing a liquor store; put me in jail.  This was in September of 1965.  And I stayed in jail until November, until after the election, after the Sheriff had been elected.  This was big headlines, major headlines.
Speaker 1: This is in Buffalo?
Speaker 2: In Buffalo, yes.  And I took a lie detector test.  They eventually concluded that I wasn't guilty.  I passed the lie detector test.  The grand jury no-billed me and, and I was set free in November and went back to my job at Bethlehem Steel.  I was a millwright, member of a union, working my way through, you know, just as happy as I could be.  In June of 19--in July of 1966, I decided to buy a new car.  I had a Pontiac, I think, or some, some GM [General Motors] car.  And I wanted a Cadillac.  So I ordered one.  It was white on white in white (laughs) with a six-way seat and a little knob that you, (laughs) oh, this was the biggy.  And I went one morning to get my car.  And I stopped by to pick up my mother [Mattie Allen Richie] because I wanted her to be the first woman to ride in my car; picked up my mother.  And I--on Greenwood Avenue, drove to Utica [Street] and Jefferson [Avenue] and went in the bank and got $10,000 in cash to make the down payment, and went to Tinney Cadillac on Main Street, got there at four minutes to ten for a ten o'clock appointment.  And the salesman wasn't there.  He was not.  He, he was not in, in yet.  He showed up about 10:15.  So we were sitting outside of Tinney Cadillac waiting for the, the salesman to show up.  And my mother said, "Here's your mail."  And she handed me my mail.  And in the mail was an acceptance to Bronx Community College in New York City as a non-matriculated student.  I didn't know what the word non-matriculated meant.  And I asked her, "How did this happen?"  And she said, I had, had taken my sister somewhere in January of '66 [1966].  I had gone over to the house to get Faye.  And Faye had her applications for college sitting around.  And I started doodling on one.  And she completed the application and sent it in for me, and they accepted me as a non-matriculated student.  And she handed me that acceptance.  And as we were sitting in the car, I said, okay, Mom, here's $10,000 you got to live on this for a while, cause I'm going to school.  And the guy knocked on the window, the salesman knocked on the window.  He said, "You ready?"  And I said, "I changed my mind."  He said, "What?"  I said, "I just got accepted into college, and I'm going."  And I said, "I want you to take this car, and give me a car that I owe no payments on."  So he gave me a 1962 Ford, and took my Pontiac whatever it was.  And I took my mother home.  And I said, "Mama, I'm going to school."  And I went to New York to go to school.
Speaker 1: So you had your mother to thank.
Speaker 2: I had my mother to thank.
Story_ID: 19441
Speaker 1: I went to Bronx Community College--
Speaker 2: Is that where you met your wife, right?
Speaker 1: Night school, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's where I met, I met Julia [C. Thomas], my first year there, my second year there.  My first year, oh, I had fun.  The fun ended when I met my wife (laughs), but it was actually list--looked--I went one evening to a, to a Paul Boutelle lecture.  He was a, a--I don't think he was Communist.  I think he was a Socialist.  He was a Socialist.  And I went to a lecture of his.  And after the lecture--actually, in, in the interim, I mean in the break, I was standing outside of the lecture hall.  And I was explaining what Paul had just said to about four or five very nice-looking young women who were just looking up and me and with their (laughs) eyes wide open and believing everything I had to say of interpreting Mr. Boutelle's words.  And everything I would say, this voice kept disagreeing with me (laughs), you know.  And I kept saying, well, you know, get your own group.  I've, I've got mine here (laughs).  And she wouldn't let me say what I wanted to say.  And so this group broke up, and I went over, and we started arguing and they eventually asked us to leave the lecture hall so that Mr. Boutelle could say what he wanted to say.  And we left and walked home.  And we've been together ever since (laughs).
Speaker 2: Now, did you say you had so much fun the first year.  Were you happy to be in school or?
Speaker 1: I was delighted to be in school.  I was absolutely delighted to be in school.  I had, I had a job, okay.  I had an apartment in New York.  I had-it's interesting because I would occasionally run out of money.  And I, and I wondered how I could just go to New York and set up an apartment without a job, just quit my job, with no money, you know, and, and start school and start my life.  I mean I always wondered where I got the security to do that.  And it actually came from my mother [Mattie Allen Richie].  My mother had nothing, okay.  She was living on the money I left, I left her.  And I knew that I had to send money home for her.  But if I ever got in trouble, when--and a couple of times I got in trouble, I needed financial help, I'd call Mom and tell her.  And she'd get it for me.  And she, she didn't have it herself, but she'd borrow it from friends.  But I, I was--it was that confidence.  I absolutely knew that she would get-that she'd be able to help me.  And that's what allowed me to, to, to start my life.  But I, I enjoyed school.  And I, and I, I went to--it's interesting.  This is, this is true.  I took two courses my first year.  I took German and I took college math.  I needed math and German, I knew.  Well, I got four points in both of them.  I got A's in both of them.  I got A's in German because I, I could speak German.  I got A's in math because the first test we took, I was the only one to get a hundred on the test.  And after the test, two or three people asked me if I wanted to form a study group with them.  And I had my own apartment.  We formed a study group.  We met every Sunday at my house.  And I ended up teaching them the subject.  And in teaching them the subject, I learned it, you know.  And it was a, it was a great social event.  It was very enjoyable.  I had a ball.  And I discovered a year and a half, two years later, I found the test paper.  And I hadn't gotten a hundred.  I'd gotten ninety, just like half the class did.  But in grading the paper, the professor missed the one mistake that I had made.  He, he, he gave me minus ten points on it.  But then in going through, he missed a page and he gave me a hundred.  And it created an image in the class with him and with me that just carried me through it.  And he, he expected me to get an A, and I got an A.  And, and it, because I, because of the role that I had because, because the other students expected me to know more, I had to learn more to teach them.  And so I'm telling you, it was self-fulfilling prophecy.  It was just incredible.  But I didn't discover that for another year and a half.  And then I went to Bronx Day School for a year, okay.  And I got--I aced all my classes there.  So I went to, when I transferred to City College for my last two years, I went there with a four-point index.  And I just, just kept it up.
Speaker 2: So that's where expectation meets reality.
Speaker 1: That's where expectation meets reality.
Speaker 2: So then when you graduate, it's 19--
Speaker 1: Seventy.
Speaker 2: Seventy, okay.  And at this point, are you deciding you want to--what did you major in?  That's the other thing.
Speaker 1: Philosophy.
Speaker 2: Philosophy.
Speaker 1: Theory of action.
Story_ID: 19442
Speaker 1: When you went to Bronx--Teachers, I mean, I'm sorry, not Bronx, but--
Speaker 2: Buffalo State Teachers [College, now Buffalo State College]?
Speaker 1: Buffalo, yeah, were you looking to be a teacher?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so where did the philosophy--were you thinking you still wanted to teach at that point or what did--?
Speaker 2: I just enjoyed it.  I really enjoyed philosophy, okay.  And I, and I, I liked Kay Irani, my Philosophy instructor.  I had wanted to take as many classes with him as I could.
Speaker 1: Can you spell his name?
Speaker 2: I-R-A-N-I.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Kay was K-A-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, but, so that, that really was, it was sort of exploring issues--?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --of the philosophical, okay.  Has that been helpful to you in your career, your philo--you know, your degree philosophy or your approach with life, do you think?
Speaker 2: I think my approach with life, yeah.
Speaker 1: In what way?
Speaker 2: Well, it, it--especially with raising my, my girls.  I'm, I'm just deciding that maybe I'll tell you the whole truth about, about my, my sons too.  But anyway, I, I treated my girls, I mean I forced them to think philosophically from the day they were born.  I mean I used to have long, involved philosophical conversations with them, you know, when they were a year old, you know, (laughs) asking them to respond intelligently to what I'm telling you here.  I mean what, what are you, what's going on?  What is this goo-goo?  If you can't speak English, don't say anything (laughs), you know.  But it, it, it has, it's had a mellowing effect, you know, and it makes me--it's helped me to understand, you can't take yourself too seriously.
Speaker 1: And so you graduate valedictorian.  Your mother [Mattie Allen Richie] and father [Leroy Richie, Sr.] at graduation?  Are they at graduation?
Speaker 2: Yes. Yep, they are.
Story_ID: 19443
Speaker 1: You know what amaze--you've had these, like two or three brushes with the law, two was it--
Speaker 2: Well, no, no.  It--the most significant brush is yet to come.  You haven't heard about it.  I'm in college.  My brother [Peter Richie] is in New York, okay.  And my brother is a major league pimp in New York, okay.  And he's living at, in the penthouse of the apartments on the--what is the thing on the East River, United Nations Apartments, okay.  He's living in the penthouse of the United Nations Apartments, okay, with his, his girlfriend, all right.  And I am living in the Bronx.  And he's supporting me.  I mean he's giving me money, and, you know.  And then he tells me one day that he's--and now, by now, I'm living with Julia [C. Thomas].  Julia and I have, moving in together.  And he, he tells me one day that he's getting busted, okay, that he's got to go back to jail for a year because he violated his parole.  So he calls me, and he says that he wants me to come with him, okay.  And I said, "Okay, Pete."  So he comes to my apartment.  And we go up to the Bronx.  And we sit there for a couple of hours.  And he's interviewed and I'm interviewed.  And they violate him, okay.  And he says, "Roy, take my clothes and take them to your apartment.  Okay, I don't want Dee to have my clothes, okay."  So I go down to the, to the, to his apartment to get his clothes, okay.  I knock on the door.  Dee comes and, "Who is it?"  I said, "It's me, Dee."  She opens the door, and I go in.  And I said, "I came to get Pete's clothes."  Okay, so I, I take his clothes, okay; take all of his suits.  He's got fifteen suits.  I take his suits.  He's got two guns there, okay.  And he's got $30,000 in, in cash, okay.  So I take the $30,000 in cash, and put it in my pockets.  I take the two guns and stick them in here, and I take the clothes and them over here, okay.  And I get a--and I leave the apartment.  Well, when I get to the door, I looked at Dee, and she looked at me, and she's looking unhappy.  I said, "This doesn't make any sense, does it?"  She said, "No, it doesn't."  So I hand her the guns, okay, and I hand her the money.  I swear to God, I hand her the guns and I hand her the money.  And she hands me $5,000.  She said, "You take that."  I said, "Okay," 'cause, all, all the money I get from Pete, I, I actually get from her, okay.  And I take the, I mean I, I put the money in my pocket, take the clothes, and I go downstairs.  I get off the elevator, and I'm walking through the lobby and there are forty-seven policemen in the lobby, forty-seven policemen, yelling and screaming at each other, "Here he is, here he is; he's coming out, he's coming out now."  When I get outside, I call a cab.  The cab opens up the door, okay.  I get, I put the clothes in the, in the back of the cab by the time they figure out what they're doing and they stop me, okay.  They arrest me.  They're fooling with--they, they put their hands in, in the car, okay.  They're patting down the clothes, and they come out and here's are vial of, of heroin, okay.  They say, "Got you," and they arrest me possession of heroin, okay, put me in jail.  Julia comes down, gets a lawyer to defend me.  My lawyer stands up in court and says, for 300 years we've been oppressed, okay (laughs), and now, they're trying to do this and do that.  And they finally, they eventually dismissed the charges after, after about two weeks.  Okay, I'm, I'm ready to graduate--they had designated me valedictorian of the class already when this happens, okay, (laughs), and I'm arrested for drug dealing. (laughs).  Now, I always thought, on reflection that they set me up, that that, that, that those drugs were not in Pete's clothes, that they had, they planted those drugs on me, okay, in the clothes.
Speaker 1: Why do you think that?
Speaker 2: Pardon?
Speaker 1: Why do you think that on further reflection?
Speaker 2: Because I don't think Dee would have, would possibly have allowed me to walk out of there with any drugs in, in--I mean she--that's why, I mean I looked at her, and she was saying, "Roy, what are you doing?"  And the, the--God must have intervened to make me give up those guns in there 'cause if I--I wouldn't be here today (laughs), you know.  I mean in one sec--how close I came.  So what they did was, they took me back upstairs.  They said, "We won't arrest you, we won't arrest you.  We know you're not, you're not Pete.  We know you're not guilty.  Okay, we're not gonna arrest you.  You just help us get into Pete's apartment, just knock on the door, like you did before, okay?"  And I knocked on the door, and they were all hidden.  Dee came to the door, "Roy?"  I said, "Hi, Dee, it's me, and I've only got twenty-seven policemen (laughs)."  And they started knocking down the door, okay.  Dee said, "I'm not letting you in."  "We have a warrant."  "I don't care, I'm not gonna let you in."  Well, they broke down the door, and by the time they broke down the door, there were no drugs.  They found the money, and they found her, her book, I mean where she had her clients' name and everything, arrested her, and they arrested me.

Speaker 1: When do you get arrested?
Speaker 2: In January of--
Speaker 1: 1970.
Speaker 2: 1970.  Yes, that's right.  That's right.
Speaker 1: So did you get arrested before or after you applied to law school?
Speaker 2: Before.
Speaker 1: Oh, 'cause you got--okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, now, okay, so--but what is motivating you to go on, at this point, to law school?  What is, what's making you even think that that's what you want to do?
Speaker 2: I, I took a class.  I really--boy, I wish I had some magnificent answer to that question.  I took a class in Constitutional law.  And my professor and I ended up debating most of the year about, about different positions.  And he, he pushed me, and he made me, he made me defend state's rights in Alabama and, and he challenged me, and I enjoyed it.  I loved it.  And he said, "Boy, you ought to go to law school."  And I said, "That's exactly what I'm going to do."  I remembered that I had wanted to be a lawyer when I was in high school.  And I said, okay, I'm gonna do that.  It's nothing more dramatic or significant than that.
Speaker 1: And you chose those three law schools to apply to because?
Speaker 2: He suggested them.  I got in all three; wanted to go to Harvard [University Law School] 'cause I'd heard a lot about it.  It really was a good, good school.  And Julia's [Julia Thomas Richie] mother said, you may be living with my daughter, but you're not taking her out of the [New York] City without marrying her (laughs).  And we weren't ready to get married.  So I said, "No, I'm, I'm not gonna leave the city.  We're gonna stay here."  And I chose NYU [New York University School of Law] just because I didn't--I couldn't handle Columbia [University School of Law].  Columbia was, at that point in my life, to see Harlem, to walk through Harlem to that pristine Greek setting of Columbia.  The contrast was too great for me.  I enjoyed NYU.  I liked NYU.  I liked being downtown, you know, right on, right on the park.  It worked for me.  And it was a great, great experience.  We got married in the law school, you know.  We really got (unclear)--I enjoyed that experience tremendously.
Speaker 1: So when you get there, when you--are you, you know, are you helped, financed through scholarship or some?  Are you paying or, you know--
Speaker 2: I'm paying my own way.
Speaker 1: You're paying your own way.  Now, did you find the first a little daunting?
Speaker 2: Well, I worked during the first year.  My, my--as I'd finished college and I worked for the Urban League in New York.  I worked for Ron Brown, and I ran the, the National Student Summer Program.  I actually worked for Jewel Cooper who worked for Ron Brown.  And--
Speaker 1: And Ron Brown was doing what at that time?
Speaker 2: He was working for the Urban League.  He was in charge of the Youth Department there.  And we were the same age, I mean, and we were, we were pretty good friends.  And I helped cover for him.  His reputation was well earned.  And I don't have to tell you what reputation it was.  So I worked, pretty much full time during the summer.  And then when I, when I needed to during the year, I got a, got a salary.  But the only way I got--I mean I'd figured it out.  And actually, my thinking was this, I said, look, most of the people here can write better than I can.  And probably 60, 70 percent of them are smarter than me.  And they're younger.  But there's one thing that they don't have, that I have, and that's the ability to work twenty-four hours a day.  They can't outwork me.  My first year of law school, I studied seven hours every day, seven days a week.  I don't care whether I went to class.  Class time was an addition.  I studied seven hours a day.  And I did all right.  I couldn't write for the 'Law Review' because I just didn't have the time (laughs).  I mean the 'Law Review' was--I didn't appreciate what 'Law Review' meant.  So I didn't, you know, they, they asked me and I said, "No, thanks.  I, I don't have time for that."  That's what kids do.  I've got to make a living (laughs).  And I, and I, I worked until November or December of my second year.  Then it just, I mean, then it just got to be too much.  I mean I just, I didn't, I couldn't do it anymore.
Story_ID: 19445
Speaker 1: Do you remember your teachers that you had your first year?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Did you have any preference for any of the subjects that you gravitated to, towards or, or property or criminal law, I mean any preference there?
Speaker 2: Not that I, not that I recall.
Speaker 1: Do you feel that you had a natural affinity to legal training or thinking like a lawyer?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: It just came so easily.  It came so naturally.  I understood so much.  I guess, I guess corporations really turn me on and being able to manipulate corporate law.  That, that's what got to me because I, I was gonna be a, a criminal lawyer.  And it's just another serendipitous event.  My second year of law school, you know, you get a legal job after your second year.  When my legal--in March, I signed up for a job working for a lawyer in the Bronx.  My job was to go to the courthouse every morning and sit at a bench near a telephone.  And he would call me, okay.  I'd have papers.  And I'd have to write up, okay, what he told--he'd call me and tell me what to write up and go file it in court.  And he's gonna pay me to do that, okay.  That was my job after the second year of law school.  And what happened was, I applied, literally true, I applied for an Arthur Garfield Hayes Civil Liberties Fellowship, with Norman Dorsen.  You know who Norman Dorsen is?  He's head of the ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union], okay.  He was our Constitutional law professor.  And Norm Dorsen (laughs) Norman Dorsen was interviewing me.  I wrote the application, and Norman Dorsen interviewed me.  And in his office, he doesn't have a chair for you to sit down.  You have to stand up when you're interviewed by him.  So I was standing in front of the desk being interviewed by him, and there's a knock on the door.  And a young woman who had worked at the [John F.] Kennedy White House named Terry Rose Saunders came in the room.  And she was one of the best built women I had seen in my life.  She was unbelievable.  And she bounced up to the desk and put her application for this fellowship (laughs) on, and she bounced away (laughs).  And she bounced out of the office.  I looked at Norman, and I said, "If you give her one, you give me one too (laughs)."  And he did (laughs).  And the three of us used to sit and drink sangrias all (laughs), and we had a great time.  But I, again, I, I think being a little bit older, it helped a lot.  Well, once I got the fellowship.  I rushed it on my resume, and I gave it to Leroy Clark.  Okay, and Leroy Clark, who was a black professor there, and who was my--had become a friend by that time, gave it to a fellow named Steve Piega (ph.) who was a tax lawyer at White and Case [LLP].  And Steve Piega took it down to White and Case, and they gave me an interview late in the year to, for a summer associate position.  And I remember the interview because I wore a blue jacket and light pants to the interview.  And halfway through--I'm talking to people and talking to people, and I, and I said to them, I said, "You know, one of the things I notice about you guys is that you all have suits on."  I said, "Is that the uniform?"  The guy said, "Yeah, it is."  I said, "All right.  If you hire me, I'll wear a suit.  You got my word on it (laughs)."  And they hired me for the summer.  They hired me for the summer, and I loved it.  My God, I loved it.  It was the summer that [President Richard] Nixon the, instituted the Pay Board.  The Pay Board--when did you graduate from law school?
Speaker 1: I graduated from law school in '77 [1977].
Speaker 2: Okay, well, you missed the Pay Board.  But the Pay Board was, was an organ of government that had to approve all increases in corporate pay because there was pay freeze on, okay.  So any pay, any increase that you had, you had to go through the Pay Board.  So executives were all, from all over the country were filing these petitions to get pay increase and, and demonstrating why they needed pay increases.  And they were having their lawyers write it up, and it, it fell to me to do this.  They gave me this job.  I was writing seventeen-page letters on behalf of Newmont Mining CEO [chief executive officer], and Bankers Trust CEO.  And after I'd write the letter, I'd then go around and try to get some lawyer in the firm to sign the letter 'cause I couldn't sign it.  And they wanted to have nothing to do with it.  And I would, I, I remember Bert Abel (ph.).  Finally he said, "Okay, Roy, I'll sign your letters."  He was a senior associate, never would make partner, okay.  (laughs)  And they kept him around because he was blue, blue sky, State Blue Sky [Laws] expert, okay.  But he used to sign the letters for me.  And I, and so I had this practice all to myself.  Any time a Pay Board request came in, they gave it to me.  And, and I remember when I left after the summer, they--well, they did two things.  One, they continued to send me Pay Board stuff, okay; made me an offer to come back, continued to send me Pay Board stuff.  And when they found out that O'Melveny and Myers [LLC] and the other big law firm on the West Coast had, would--they were paying for a trip for me and Julia [C. Thomas] to come out there and spend a week.  One was paying Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.  The other was paying Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday.  And I was going out there from Monday to Monday, to spend a week out there with both firms, okay.  And they called me up and said--I will never forget this conversation.  Mort [Morton] Moskin called me and said, "Roy," he said, "You can't be unethical if you're gonna practice law.  If you have decided to come with the firm of White and Case, then you cannot ethically accept those trips to the West Coast.  If you've not decided to come with us, then, if it's still an open question, then you may ethically accept those trips, but not if you've decided to come with us.  You can't do it.  And we just want to warn you that it would an ethical violation."  Do you believe that?  I'm young, dumb, what do I know?  They know I'm coming with them.  I know I'm coming with them (laughs).  I've still got cases that I'm doing for them.  Those turkeys--do you know I passed the New Jersey Bar, and they wouldn't let me get admitted.  They did not want me to have any reason not to join that firm.
Story_ID: 19446
Speaker 1: Put things in context because White and Case [LLP] is like a silk stocking, New York firm.  And how many blacks were at that firm?  I mean you--
Speaker 2: There was one.
Speaker 1: One, and how--when would he come with the firm?
Speaker 2: Oh, he came with the firm two years earlier and had failed the Bar [Examination].  Oh, he, and he, and I, I got mad at them for offering him a job.  They never should have done it.  He graduated from Columbia [University School of Law], okay.  And I got mad at him for staying.  I said, "You've got to quit.  You've got to quit, get out of here."  I told him that summer, during the summer.  And he did quit.  I was the only one when I started 'cause he quit.  I said, "Get out of here.  Go, go make a life for yourself.  It doesn't make sense for you to be here.  This is not what you do well."
Speaker 1: So they took to you and you took to them.  I'm just wondering--you--
Speaker 2: I did take to them.  I enjoyed the atmosphere.  I enjoyed how you got assignments, so that I ended up not working with anybody I didn't want to work with, and nobody who didn't want to work with me, asked me to work with them.  So, it was a completely consensual relationship.
Speaker 1: But what about the culture, the corporate culture, I mean besides the whole suit description.  There are, there are cultural things.  This is--you know, had you been in that white an environment before?
Speaker 2: No, I never had, never had.  It fit.  I fit.  They fit.  I decided that they had to know who I was.  I did decide early that, that I couldn't become them; that they had to know who I was, okay.  And, and so I was me.  I was me.  I--this was very funny.  Before they decided to make me the offer, the managing partner invited me to dinner and insisted that I bring my wife.  "I'm not married."  "Well, bring your fiancée."  "Well, I, you know, I'll bring somebody."  "No, no, no.  Bring your fiancée."  They wanted to meet Julia [C. Thomas], okay.  They sat us at different tables. They sat us at different tables.  They wanted to find out who she was, okay.  After dinner there are, you know, fifteen couples, okay.  After dinner, the men are downstairs, and we're shooting pool.  And, and I remember the, the balls broke, and I'm shoot--playing this guy.  And we're laughing and talking.  And he missed a shot.  And I looked at the table, and it was natural run.  So I chalked up, okay.  And I started hitting the ball; made one, made two, made three, made four, and drew the ball against the rail.  And it came out a little bit, okay.  And I went back, and I had--behind my back, I had to put the ball behind my back, up like this, okay, and stab at it.  And I stabbed at it, okay.  And it stabbed across the table, and went in the pocket, and the cue ball came back around.  And Julia said, "Roy!"  And I said, "Oh, God, was I lucky."  (laughs)  And I just put the pool cue down, and noticed that they were all standing there--(mouth hanging open, laughing).  Julia said, "What are you gonna--blow my life now?"  She was, she said, "Roy!"
Speaker 1: She just called it out?
Speaker 2: Yeah, because I was--.
Speaker 1: In the moment.
Speaker 2: I was in the moment.
Speaker 1: You were back at the pool hall.
Speaker 2: I was back at the pool hall.
Speaker 1: (laughing).
Speaker 2: (laughing), and, and I remember Dave Blair saying, "No, no, no, no.  You didn't learn that at City College (laughs)."  I said, "Well, I was in the service, remember?" (laughs)
Speaker 1: The cases you got assigned and everything, they were good cases.  You, like how many interns--the summer that you worked, your second year, how many--
Speaker 2: Well, remember, I'm a few years older.
Speaker 1: You're a few--so you think that really helped?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think it helped tremendously because I was one of them.  I was, you know, they, they treated me like an equal because I was an equal in age with them, you know.  And, I mean we'd laugh and talk and we had the same kind of, same kind of concerns, same kinds of issues, you know.
Story_ID: 19447
Speaker 1: Were you aware of other black lawyers entering into--you know, this is still the point where--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --blacks are new to even corporate law firms.  So--
Speaker 2: Only the one other, only one other black from NYU [New York University School of Law] went to a corporate law firm.
Speaker 1: And who was--do you know who that was?
Speaker 2: His name was Walter Lewis, yeah, and he--
Speaker 1: He went where?  Where did he go with, do you know?
Speaker 2: No, I don't remember, but he, it didn't work out well.  He called me a few years ago, and he needed my support.  They were gonna disbar him for something.  I mean it just didn't--his life hasn't, hasn't worked out that well.
Speaker 1: So, okay, okay.  So your age--
Speaker 2: I, I don't--
Speaker 1: No, it's not just your--I mean, but your age--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but, you credit it to your age.  And what are you, what kind of cases are working on besides the--you said, the--
Speaker 2: Well, I, I went there to be a litigator because that's what I thought I wanted to be.  And I decided while I was there that I'm--I mean you, you work four months in each department [at White and Case LLP].  And I worked first in the, in the corporate department, and then I went to litigation.  But they never--I always kept my cases.  I mean they never, you know, my, my clients that I had from, from the corporate department, I kept (laughs), even through litigation.  So I never really left the corporate department.  And I also went to tax, which I didn't, didn't particularly enjoy.  But it--and, and I started in, in July, right after the Bar [Examination], I started.  And in September, they put me on the hiring committee.  They did.  And, and I remember, we went to Philadelphia, okay, went to Philadelphia to interview at Temple [University Beasley School of Law] and the other law schools in Philadelphia.  There were eight of us that went, okay.  And we'd meet every night, okay, and review the interviews and, and talk about who was coming back for a second interview.  And, and the, they had identified three black students to come back for second interviews, okay.  And I said, "Let me see those, those, those resumes."  And I looked at them, and two of them clearly didn't make the cut, clearly didn't make the cut.  I said, "What are you doing?"  I said, "First of all, why excite people if you don't mean it, and secondly, if you do mean it and you do hire them, if they can't do the work, why give them a miserable experience?"  I said, don't--I mean people can have a good life and not work for White and Case or at any of these firms.  I said, "Hire people that are ready."  And they, they eventually did.  Geraldine Reed Brown.  Geraldine Reed Brown was wonderful.  She was a black woman who was a lawyer (laughs).  I remember cause Gerri, (laughs) the second--and she was very formal, very formal, married to a black lawyer who was head of the ITT [Industries] legal department.  But Gerri, one day we had this law student, black woman, come to work for the, for us.  And she came to see me when she heard I was black.  And she said to me, and I told her we had a black woman working there.  And she said, "A sister?  You have a sister working here?"  (laughs)  And she, and I said, "Yes."  She said, "Oh, my God, where?"  And I said, "She's right down the hall, across the hall."  And she went over there (laughs).  And she said, "Sister."  (laughs) And Gerri, Gerri got up and walked out of her office and walked down to my office.  And she said, "Roy."  "Yes."  "Would you please take this young woman in hand and explain to her where she is and how she should act?  And do not ever, ever permit her to call me 'sister' again.  Is that clear?" (laughs).  I said, "It's perfectly clear, Gerri."  (laughs)  And she laughed.  But the woman was devastated.  And I said, "No, you don't understand."  And I explained it to her. (laughs).  But I, I just mean--one thing that they made me do at White and Case that I didn't like, the year after I got there, they hired a guy.  He was Italian.  And he showed up.  He was a summer clerk.  And he showed up in a dark blue shirt and a white tie and a silk suit, okay.  (laughs).  He showed up for work like that.  And they came to get me, and said, "Roy, take him to lunch."  I said, "Take him to lunch?  For what?"  "Well, you see how he's dressed, just, you know, if it, if it comes up during lunch."  I said, "Why me?"  I said, "This is a white problem.  It's not my problem."  "Roy, this is not a request.  Take him to lunch (laughs)."  So I had to take him to lunch and explain to the guy that this wasn't the way you dress in this, in this environment.

Speaker 1: Why don't you describe for our audience (laughs) what the whole hist--White and Case [LLP], what kind of firm it is?  I mean I've referred to it as a 'silk stocking' firm, but can you just give people context for the firm, its clients, its history?
Speaker 2: Well, it, it's clients were CBS [Columbia Broadcasting System], Prudential [Financial, Inc.], ABC [American Broadcasting Company], Bankers Trust.  It was the number six law firm in the country when I, when I joined it.  If you want me to put it in context, the secretaries on the twenty-fifth floor wore white gloves.  They did.  Haliburton Fales was the managing partner.  And Haliburton Fales was, you know, he was the upper crust of the upper crust.  And that's the kind of firm it was.  I loved it.  I absolutely loved it, and they, they loved me.  I mean they wanted me to come back after I--I left after five years to go to the FTC [Federal Trade Commission].  And they wanted me to come back after the FTC, you know.  I suspect they'd take me back now.  I mean we, we had a, we had a great relationship.  I had a, had, had good friends.  Julia [C. Thomas] has never forgiven me for leaving the firm because it was her turn to plan the Christmas party the year we left (laughs).  And she never got to plan the Christmas party.
Speaker 1: The acculturation process, when did that happen?  How did you so easily fit?
Speaker 2: I have--
Speaker 1: This, I'm just saying, age is one--how did you so easily fit into--
Speaker 2: I have no clue.
Speaker 1: --blue blood America?
Speaker 2: I have no clue.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have absolutely no clue.  And, and it, it had to be my mother [Mattie Allen Richie], but I don't know enough about her to know how it happened.  But this has happened, I mean I went from White and Case to running a federal agency, to being an assistant general counsel and then the first black vice president at Chrysler [Corporation].  In that, in that context, I joined, you know, boards of the oldest institutions in America and it all fits.  And I don't have a clue as to--I know you can't say MF in certain situations.  I learned that (laughs).  But I'm, I'm, I'm being funny now.  I, I don't know.  I don't--I can't, I don't get it.
Story_ID: 19449
Speaker 1: I represented AB Bofors, a foreign--these, they wanted to buy--Bofors is the company that actually built the German war machine, okay.  But they were an aircraft company.  And they, they were buying a company in Boston, okay, using Eurodollars to do it.  And the company in Boston was in three divisions.  One division, they were selling to the president, okay.  And the president was buying it through a lockbox arrangement with the, with the Bank of Boston.  And the Bank of Boston was our, Bank of Boston was actually facilitating the Eurodollar exchange too.  So it was a very complicated deal involving--and there was, there was a Japanese connection because the second division was doing an inventory borrowing from, an inventory-based borrowing from a Japanese bank.  So I mean it was just an incredible deal.  And what happened--I remember what happened.  There was a guy, there was a senior associate, about to be partner, had been there [at White and Case LLP] eight years.  He was running the deal.  The partner on the deal was Tom Ramser (ph.) and it was me, okay.  There were three of us doing the deal at first.  And then, you know, we'd get other people as we needed them.  Well, as the deal got structured--and this was about two months into the deal, as the deal got structured, we were in a meeting.  And the, the, the Swedes were all there, okay.  And they were looking for board approval from their board, all right.  And the only way we had to communicate with them, the fastest way was a telex machine.  Do you know what a telex is?  So Tom looked at Jim, the senior associate and said, "Jim, dictate a telex explaining the deal so we can get it approved."  And Jim said, "Okay."  And he walked over to the telex machine.  There was a secretary sitting there.  And he started dictating, all right.  And it didn't happen.  I mean it, he'd start a sentence, and he'd stop, and then he'd start another sentence.  And he'd stop.  And Jim--and Tom finally looked at him with--'cause the clients were in the room.  And he looked at him and said, "Jim, let's, we'll, we'll do it later.  Get me a cup of coffee, would you, please?"  And Jim looked at him.  He said, "Now, Jim."  When Jim left the room to get him a coffee, he said, "Roy, dictate that."  And I got up.  I got my notes.  I walked over to the machine, and I dictated the, the, you know, (laughs) the memo.  And it was a three and a half, three and a half-page memo.  But I just dictated the whole deal, okay.  And we sent it, okay.  And when Jim came back in the room with the coffee, he said, "Jim, let me talk to you."  He took Jim out, and he was sent to Japan.  He was sent to Japan, and he spent six months, minus one day in Japan.  And when he came back, it was over.  Tom got stuck in Panama.  There was, this was a time in the late, in the mid-'70s [1970s] when they closed down Panama and the troops were there.  And you couldn't get out of Panama.  Tom was there, okay.  So it was my deal.  I did the whole deal, okay.  And it was so tough, I'm a first-year associate, okay.  It was, the toughest part was finding people to work for me 'cause you know, people couldn't--wouldn't work for you.  And it was fortunate, during the summer, 'cause I had summer associates.  They used to call it "Richie and his and his thousand minions," because I had all the summer people working for me (laughs).  They were the only ones that would.  Nobody else would work for me.  But I got the deal done.  I remember I closed the deal.  And it was great.  I mean I, I enjoyed it.  Now, that was the biggest deal I did there.  But then I did Prudential [Financial Inc.] deals, and I did, I did all kinds of--
Speaker 2: Did you have a mentor there, someone who took you under their wing?
Speaker 1: Tom.
Speaker 2: Oh, he's the one, okay.
Speaker 1: Tom, Tom Ramser, yeah, he, he, and Mort [Morton] Moskin took me under, under his wing too.
Story_ID: 19450
Speaker 1: Mort [Morton Moskin] was real tough.  Mort and I had this wonderful conversation.  Mort is the smartest human being I've ever met.  And I always told him that the thing that was wrong with the American legal system is that he never ended up on the Supreme Court because we needed him on the Supreme Court.  He was the best and the brightest, and he ended up working for corporate America [at White and Case LLP] and making money.  And that's a shame.  But he called me one day.  We had two wonderful conversations.  I did something wrong, something he really didn't like.  And he called me up, and he just reamed me for it.  And I said--and when it was over, and when he was finished reaming me, okay, he said, "Roy," said, "I've been assigned to give you your feedback this year."  He says, I said, "Yeah."  He says, "Well, take everything I just said and put it in context, but you're doing a great job."  (laughs) That, that was my feedback.  That was my performance review for the year. (laughs) The other conversation we had was, he called me up one day--cause he was at midtown [New York, New York], and I was downtown.  Mort called me up, and he said, "Roy, I just faxed you a, a, a balance sheet that I want you to look at."  I said, "Yep, it just got here, Mort.  I'm looking at it as we speak."  A balance sheet and income statement.  He says, "Our client--" and he told me what the client wanted, "But I really need this balance sheet to be analyzed.  Would you, would take it home this evening and really take a careful look at it?  And let me know what you think.  And I've got some specific questions."  And he asked me four specific questions.  He said, "See if you can get, see if you can get, get the answers for those questions for me."  I said, "Mort, okay, but I, I've got the answers to the questions now.  I, I've been thinking about it."  "Well, I really want you to spend the night thinking about it carefully and getting, getting--and get, get back to me tomorrow and let me know what you think."  I said, "Okay, Mort, but, Mort, I know the answers right now.  I've thought about it, and I can give you the answers right now, if you want them."  Whew. "Roy, take the God damned papers home and show them to Julia [C. Thomas], please."  (laughs)  I said, "Yes, Mort."  He said, "Goodbye."  And he hung up the phone. (laughs) Julia's an accountant. (laughs)  He didn't want my--I was so.  I, I, I thought, "Can I sue him?  What, what can I do?" (laughs)  He didn't care about my thinking about accounting issues.  He--because I'd come in with these wonderful accounting scenarios and, and, and analyses, you know.  And he used to, "Roy, how do you, how do you get, how do you know this stuff?" I said, "Well, I took accounting for lawyers when I was in law school, and I'm--"  "Yeah, but it seems a little sophisticated for that."  "Well, I--Julia's an accountant." (laughs) And so he, so he decided to use that. (laughs)  I will never forget that because I was so confident that I had the answers.  And actually, I had three of the four.  I missed the fourth one.  And Julia straightened me out.  But, yeah. (laughs) But it just fit.  I, I can't tell you why it worked as well.  I can tell you this, that I used to get term sheets from, from Prudential [Financial Inc.] especially, very, very complicated term sheets.  And the senior guy would, would do the negative covenants, the, the negative covenants and the, oh, the default provisions, okay.  And the junior guy would do the, the, the boilerplate and the, and the affirmative covenants, okay.  You--cause you divide the, the loan agreement up into four ways.  But the negative covenants were and the, and the, and the default provisions were the most complicated in terms of, you know, how you had to read through it and write through it.  And I remember working with a guy and getting his negative covenants.  He was senior guy, getting his negative comm--his, his negative covenants and, and getting his write-up at six o'clock in the evening.  We were due at the printers at 7:15 [P.M.].  And I had done my part, and I was gonna integrate them.  And I read his, and his didn't work.  Now, he was an eight-year associate, just about to be made partner.  And it just devastated me that his didn't work.  And so I had to redo them.  It took me two and a half hours to redo the whole thing to make them, to make them work.  Well, I did that, okay.  And you have to have a mind--I don't think that's a matter of intelligence.  I think it's a matter of how your mind works.  You know, do you--can you get through those, that kind of stuff.  And if you've ever read, you know, the Pru bible or, or you know, one of these negative covenants that's--you know exactly what I'm talking about.  These things are, are convoluted, you know, in terms of what the lenders get and, you know, when they, when the defaults and what happens if there is a default.  And if you don't get it, you don't get it.  I mean if you can't read it, and this guy couldn't, couldn't read it.  And he had just, you know, he was able to stick it out, but they figured it out.  And he never made partner, you know.  And he's off doing something else.  He accepted a general counsel's position at a small company.  And then he, he lost that pretty soon after that.
Speaker 2: So what year were you doing--what year did you do this, you know, that you're talking about?  What year associate?  Were you second year or third year at that--the negative covenants situation?
Speaker 1: Third year, third year.
Story_ID: 19451
Speaker 1: What else are you learning about lawyering at this, you know, at this juncture?  Are you learning--cause there're other aspects of being success in a firm and, you know, working, you know, the incredible hours, lawyers work incredible hours.
Speaker 2: As I did.  What happened to me at, at--well, I was doing all right.  I mean if you are assess, you have to assess who you work for and the quality of your work, okay.  And I was right up there, me and Joe Hudson were the two--there were twenty-nine associates in my class.  And we were the two leading associates.  I mean we were the two that everybody sought, everybody wanted to work with, okay.  The year is 19--I'd been there, this is fifth year.  I'm a five, fifth-year associate, okay.  And I finished the Bofors [Defense BP] deal as a five-year associate.  I'd just finished the Bofors deal, okay.
Speaker 1: So that was a five-year deal, Bofors?
Speaker 2: Bofors was a, was a--
Speaker 1: The--the--what did--
Speaker 2: It was a two-year deal.
Speaker 1: That was a two-year, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.  I, I wasn't first year.  I was fourth and fifth year, yeah.  So I'd just finished that deal, and I came back in the office.  No, I'm sorry, third and fourth 'cause I'd been there four years when I finished Bofors, 'cause it took me another year.  I came back in the office.  And I took the morning off to play tennis.  So I got in the office about eleven o'clock, 11:15, you know.  And I went to my office, put down myself, and asked my secretary, "Are there any calls?"  She said, "No."  And I'd just walked out, just to look around and, you know, accept people's congratulations on finishing closing the deal.  Everybody knew about it.  It was the biggest thing that happened at White and Case.  So I did all that, and I walked by Joe Hudson's office.  And his door was opened, and he wasn't there.  And I walked into his office.  And I'm standing there looking in his assignment book, okay, at his slips, just seeing the quality of assignments that he's had and who he's working for.  At this point, I'm thirty-five years old, I'm a thirty-five year old man, making close to a hundred thousand dollars a year, and working at one of the top law firms in America.  And I'm standing, looking at a guy's assignment book to see whether his assignments are better than mine.  I don't want to live like this.  I don't want to do this any more.  I don't want to care about that.  I don't ever want to get caught sneaking in somebody's office (laughs) to see whether his work is as good as mine.  That's not what I signed up for.  And I decided then I had to get out.
Speaker 1: So that was--you caught yourself?
Speaker 2: I caught myself.  I said, "Jesus Christ!" And then I got a call from Norman Dorsen.  And Norman Dorsen said, "Roy, you'll get a call from a fellow named Mike [Michael] Pertschuk.  He works for the Federal Trade Commission.  In fact, he's the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission.  And he wants you to come work for him.  And Roy, you've been there long enough."
Speaker 1: Norman Dorsen from law school, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: He was your--okay, oh.  So why did he think this was gonna be a good opportunity?
Speaker 2: What, at?
Speaker 1: At the, you know, the call that you were gonna get?
Speaker 2: 'Cause he didn't want me to go to Wall Street anyway.  He didn't think--he--I guess I--
Speaker 1: 'Cause he was the ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union], he--
Speaker 2: And I worked for the ACLU.
Story_ID: 19452
Speaker 1: I did work for the ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union].  I worked for John Shallock (ph.) at the ACLU.  I need to tell you, my daughter did too.  Brooke [Richie] did too, when she, when she went through, she wanted to work for the ACLU her first year.  And she did.  So Norman [Dorsen] wanted me to leave [White and Case LLP].  He, he didn't want me to be on Wall Street.  And Mike was looking for somebody to run the New York office of the Federal Trade Commission [FTC].  And it worked.  I mean I went to Washington [D.C.] and fell in love with the Commission.  And he said, would you like a job, and I said, yes.
Speaker 2: So what worked for it, because this is a totally different--it's, it's a totally different environment.
Speaker 1: Completely different environment, absolutely completely different environment.  One thing that had happened at White and Case that probably helped facilitate the--the other, one of the other really big deals I did, I did a, a merger for First Mortgage Investors, which was the third largest real estate investment trust in the country at the time.  And it had ten debt issues outstanding, ten public debt issues.  Each one of those debt issues had to have a meeting at which the merger had to be approved.  I worked for a week without sleep, one solid week without sleep.  I ended up in the hospital with pneumonia twice.  But I used the Appeal Printing to get all my printing work done.  And a friend of mine at Appeal--a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine, but he's the biggest redneck I've ever known (laughs), you know.  But I'm okay, I'm an okay one (laughs).  But I decided to give, Red--(laughs),
Speaker 2: Redneck (unclear).
Speaker 1: I decided to give Appeal Printing all of, all of my printing on these ten deals.  And it just made his life.  I mean it was, it was sufficient for him--he, his bonus was large enough for him to pay off his mortgage on his house, you know, suddenly his wife, I mean it just made such a difference in his life.  And we were pretty good friends.  As a result of having done though, he gave me the ability for five years that I ran the FTC, I had something called, Magic Cabs available to me.  Magic Cabs are cabs that are magic cabs.  They're, when you need a cab, you call the printer.  The printer arranges for a cab for you, not, not, not--I mean if you're working on a corporate deal, you call the printer.  The printer arranges for a cab, okay.  And then it just, the cost of it is just added to the printing, you know.  And when you get the printing bill, the transportation and everything is in there; it's dinner and whatever it is, okay.  Well, after I left the FTC, I had that for five years and because we didn't regulate printing companies, I could accept it.  For five years, me and my staff, we just--we lived on Magic Cabs.  You know, whenever we worked late, whenever we went to a party, whenever we were out drinking too late, we used Magic Cabs.  It made a, quite a difference in the office.  I took naturally to managing people.  I took absolutely naturally to managing people.  I did, I also taught trade regulation law at NYU [New York University School of Law].
Speaker 2: When did that happen?
Speaker 1: In 1980.  I took over for--
Speaker 2: Wait, okay, so let's--in 19--isn't it 19--is it 1975 that you leave--1976 you leave the firm?
Speaker 1: No, '78 [1978].
Speaker 2: '78, you leave the firm, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'd been there five years, '73 [1973] to '78.
Story_ID: 19453
Speaker 1: Now, are you managing the FTC [Federal Trade Commission], the, the New York office of the FTC?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was the largest office at the time.
Speaker 1: Now, who was the, who was--you're under what administration?
Speaker 2: [President Jimmy] Carter's, Carter's administration.  Michael Pertschuk is the Chairman of the FTC.  He, he couldn't get appointed until he got married because he was living in sin with his, with this woman, and Carter wouldn't appoint him until he, (laughs) until he married her.  And so he, he married her.  And he got appointed, and then he appointed me as head of the FTC.  And I remember--
Speaker 1: Now, but how, how did you get that job though?  I mean I'm just saying, I understand that you got a call from Norm--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Norm [Norman] Dorsen.
Speaker 1: But Norm knew then--
Speaker 2: Mike had called him up and said, "I need some help in New York.  You got anybody in mind?"  And Norm said, "I've got just the right person."  And I went down and interviewed with Pertschuck and I said to Mike, after I talked to all of his people, I said, "Mike, I got to tell you.  I came here on a lark.  I came here because it was a trip to Washington [D.C.], and I thought it would be an interesting thing to do.  But I'm leaving, really wanting this job.  This is exciting.  This can--this, this I think, I want to do this.  So I hope you like me as much as I like you 'cause I think this is great."
Speaker 1: And what appealed to you about it?
Speaker 2: The ability to make a difference, the ability to, to do, to mesh what I wanted to do with what was right, okay.  I, I never felt comfortable at White and Case [LLP] with the fact that teachers made less, made less money than we did.  I, I just--it just seemed to me that the world was, was--the world had it wrong in terms of its values, that this country, at least, had it wrong in terms of its values.  We entrust our future, our children's education to people who are underpaid, unionized and undereducated, okay.  And we pay huge dollars to transactional specialists, who add no value at all to the, to the trans--to the deal.  I, there's something wrong with that, you know.  And I, while I, while they were paying me a few hundred thousand dollars a year, I just never investigated it.  But (laughs) given the opportunity to, to get out and do something else, I, I thought I'd take it.
Speaker 1: Now, so when--what were the issues that were, at that point in time, you know, sort of key areas, when you--issues when you were at the FTC?
Speaker 2: We were doing the, the rules.  We were doing the funeral rule.  We were doing the credit rule.  Mike really wanted to put in place some rules that would, that would govern the relationships between consumers and, and business.  And that's what we worked on a lot.
Speaker 1: And what about your White and Case training did you feel helped you or with the transition or was very little of it appropriate?
Speaker 2: Most of it was, was appropriate, especially the attention to detail.  I mean you'd, you know, you couldn't make a mistake at White and Case.  You just couldn't make a mistake.  I mean I learned to read backwards (laughs), you know, while I was at White and Case.  Okay, well that skill helped me a lot.  But, but I had to remake the office.  I mean this was a completely different--Mike promised me that I could hire fifty people the day I walked in.  He said, "Roy, you can hire fifty people the day you walk in.  I promise you, the day you walk in."  I said, "Well, Mike, okay, I'll take the job under those circumstances." So I left White and Case, July 5th, 1978, gone.  I'm out of here.  And I started at the FTC--I told them I'd be there August 5th--take a month off and relax.  Well, I forgot that I didn't have any money. (laughs) So when Julia [C. Thomas] asked me on the 6th of July, "Well, how are we gonna eat?" (laughs) She was still working, but it--we needed the money.  I had completely forgotten that when you take a month off, you have to have money here. (laughs) In '72 [1972], Julia took over our finances.  And so my check went to her, you know, and it had, I mean it has for thirty-five years.  So I never think about money.  I just, if I need money, I get it from her.  I had forgotten about that.  The reason that's significant is I had to go to work.  I called back and told him, Mike, I got a problem and I had to go to work two weeks earlier--three weeks earlier.  Okay, I took a week off.  He sent me to a conference in Canada on management for a week.  Then I started two weeks earlier.  Well, when I got to the FTC, there were three kinds of people there.  There were lawyers, there were secretaries, and there were something called Consumer Protection Specialists.  These were mostly fifty to sixty-year old men who had been federal postal clerks.  And they had come over as what we called, 'Woolies'.  They had come over to enforce the Wool Products Act and the Fur Products Act, okay, which were acts passed in the '60s [1960s] by [U.S.] Congress to stop fur traders, foreign traders from bringing their furs into this country, okay, and protect the industries in the, in the South, the fur and wool-trading industries in the South.  And these were guys that went around the country inspecting wool and, and other fur, okay, to make sure, animal fur, to make that they weren't foreign.  If they were foreign, they pulled them off the racks, and you couldn't sell them, okay, and it was simply protectionism.  And in the '70s [1970s], we were moving away from that.  Those acts were no longer as popular.  And so these guys, they had no jobs, okay.  And they had no pensions because--well, they had no social security protection because the federal government has a separate system, okay, and doesn't contribute to the social security system.  So, I walk into the FTC the second week of July in 1978, and there are thirty-two of these guys who are getting ready to leave in two weeks.  They're getting ready to be fired, thirty-two fifty-year-olds with no jobs and no retirement, they--nothing.  And that's so that I can hire, I can hire my fifty lawyers.  Well, after a week of watching these guys and getting to know them, I called Mike, and I said, "Mike, do you want me to make this the best office you've ever seen?"  And he says, "Yes, that's why I hired you."  I said, "Are you willing to trust me to do it my way?"  I said, he said, "What do you mean by that?"  I said, "Mike, I don't want to fire anybody.  I don't want to fire anybody.  I, I'll make this the best office in the country, but please, don't make me fire anybody.  Let them stay here.  Let me take the next six months to find them jobs, okay.  And I'll replace them with lawyers, as I find them jobs.  But over the course of that time, we'll be the best office you ever saw."  He said, "Roy, you got a deal."  And so I walked out and announced, nobody is leaving.  One guy--I had to go in on Saturday 'cause one guy, his wife called and said he was about to commit suicide.  He was in a bar across from the office, drunk at four o'clock in the afternoon on Saturday, having said goodbye to his wife for the final time.
Story_ID: 19454
Speaker 1: You were sitting in the office, and the poet, Walter--came, you know, the--.
Speaker 2: Walter Benton, the poet came to mind.  And I just love poems, but the poems he wrote about being in Europe at the end of World War II and watching what, what was happening to the German people and saying, he didn't want to be "he one to wield God's swift sword".  And I, and I remember standing on the 22nd floor and looking out of the window and saying, I'm gonna fire these guys because the world is about people.  It's not about things.  It's not about places.  It's simply about people.  And these are people.  And we've got to figure a better way to work this out.  And that, that's when I called Mike [Michael Pertschuk].  And Mike said, sure.  Take your time, but make it the best office.  And we didn't fire anybody.  And we did, we were--we got, that year, we were recognized as having the best office in the FTC [Federal Trade Commission], that year, by the end of the year.
Speaker 1: So what other things besides--.
Speaker 2: But it's interesting.  Let me just say this, and then you can ask your question.  At the end of the year when we got our plaque, everybody cheered, okay.  We had submitted one case, okay, which was a good case, but it was prepared before I got there.  And it was in Washington [D.C.].  We just had to enhance it, okay, after I got there.  And it went through, all right.  And when I, when I spoke to the, to the entire staff assembled, I said, "Folks, we have just been recognized as the best office at the FTC.  But keep in mind, we did nothing to earn it.  All we did was submit one case, and that case was submitted before I got there, before a third of you started."  And my point is simply this, don't let--if people want to recognize you for being great, accept it, but don't believe it.  And when people want to recognize you as not being great, as being lousy, maybe you have to accept it, but don't believe it.  Always figure out whether you think you're doing a good job or not, you know.  And that helped us 'cause two years later we were the worst office ever.  And it's because they wanted to get rid of me.  Miller was in, and he wanted me out. (laughs)
Story_ID: 19455
Speaker 1: You say you took this week's training course, you know.  So that week, you became a good manager or you had that instinctively?
Speaker 2: I had that instinctively.
Speaker 1: Okay, and when, the other thing is, you're not talking about one aspect.  And I'm wondering if this is a factor.  You had been, sort of been the, you know, within the Wall Street environment, which is its own sort of voice cloistered protective environment.  Government is very visible.  So was there a lot made about the fact that you were FTC [Federal Trade Commission] and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And so how did, because it's going from a very sort of private world to a public world, and being able to handle that.  And, and really managing more.  You know, I mean you found, also, you had, that was instinctive too.  But I'm just saying, being able to handle that, you know, part of it.  Were you--
Speaker 2: Well, I, fortunately, there was a guy there named Salvatore Sangiorgi (ph.).  And he was the PR [public relations] guy, and he really took me under his wing and taught me how to, how to run a public agency.  I, I had to learn that.  It wasn't easy because the view of White and Case [LLP] was, you never compete with your client for publicity, okay.  The lawyer is always in the background, okay.  And the safest response is just hang up the phone.  Don't even say, "No comment." (laughs) And so, starting from the perspective, it took me a while to get to a point where I was real comfortable.  But I, I ended up making, you know, three speeches a day sometimes for weeks on end.  I mean just going from place to place making speeches.  And Sal really did help me with that.  And he will tell you stories about how miserable it was to listen to me when I first started (laughs).  And I'd stand up in front of eight people to make a speech, and I'd read it.  And he said, (laughs) he was just dying (laughs).  But eventually, it, it--I learned it.  And I don't think I had any problem handling the press because I never trusted the press.  I always knew that when you asked me a question, you already know the answer that you want me to give and therefore, that's the answer I'm going to give.  And so anything I say is just--once I open my mouth, I've already committed the faux pas, you know, if I'm gonna commit, you know.  And so, and--but I had fun.  I thoroughly enjoyed my five years running the FTC.  It was the, of all the parts of my career, it wasn't the most lucrative, but it was the most fun.

Speaker 1: What other things are you learning and what, you know, and what are you experiencing that's helping you grown as a professional?  And what affiliations are you making also?
Speaker 2: I can't say that any, any of my affiliations helped me.  I'm really learning--
Speaker 1: Now?
Speaker 2: --to handle people, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, no, you mean, now?
Speaker 1: No, no, but I'm saying, what--or you were just learning to handle people then?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, at that point.
Speaker 2: Oh, you meant now?
Speaker 1: No, no, no, I didn't.  I thought you were making reference.
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no.  I'm, I'm, I'm--at that point in time, the affiliations I was making really didn't help me that much, but I'm--I was really learning to handle people.  I mean I handled some, some situations that were just--a fifty-nine-year old man sits in my office at 7:30 in the morning and cries his eyes out because his daughter, who was just offered a Rhodes Scholarship, dropped out of college and went to work at a 7-11 in Newark with a thirty-two-year old, one-eyed guitar player (laughs), you know.  And he (laughs) and he just couldn't handle it.  He, he was just, you know, "What do I do?"  And, you know, I had to help him solve that problem.  I mean, because otherwise, he's not gonna be functional, you know.  And, I mean, and there were, there were many of those situations where people--people used to cry in my office all the time (laughs), men and women.  And, you know, I'd, I'd help them deal with it.  But I really did learn how to manage people.  I really did enjoy it.  I made some mistakes.  I, I can tell you the mistakes I made--I won't, but I remember them.  And that, that helped me greatly when I got to Chrysler [Corporation].
Speaker 1: Now, what, you know, sometimes though people get sucked up by public life.  And so they end up staying there.  I mean that could have happened to you. No?  I mean, just saying, you know, it's, it's can be so freeing in some respects, you know--
Speaker 2: And it, and it--
Speaker 1: And it's part of that you're setting agendas as you go along cause you have to be reactive to the issues of the day, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  It was freeing.  It was very enjoyable.  It was a huge power trip, but after three years, I knew I'd been there long enough.  I knew I had to get, I mean--
Speaker 1: Why, why are you saying that?  What about Leroy Richie was saying that?
Speaker 2: When I walked into the FTC [Federal Trade Commission] office, I looked around and knew instinctively that it needed help.  It needed a complete restructuring.  And in six months, I had done that.  I worked hard at it.  I did diagrams.  I interviewed everybody in the place.  And I changed the way that office functioned.  And I made it function much, much better.  I created a turkey farm.  And people who would not work hard, okay, I put them in a, physically-separated them in another part of the office that I called the turkey farm, okay.  I couldn't fire them, but put them on the turkey farm.  And they couldn't come off the turkey farm, okay, until they started working.  I mean I'd--and it was a marvelous office for two and a half years.  It just kicked but, and it, it just worked smoothly.  But three years later, after I had done this, the office needed help.  It needed to be restructured again.  It just needed, it just--things, change is constant.  New people had come in, okay.  Some folks had retired, new assignments.  It just needed, not just a freshening.  It needed a completely fresh look.  And to my chagrin, I discovered I couldn't do it again.  I had shot my load.  I had--all the creativity I could give to it, I had given.  So, you know what I did?  I took my secretary, and I went to the movies.  And I told my number two and my number three people, I said, "You restructure the office.  And I'll come in every morning and check in with you, make sure you don't need me for anything.  And then I'm going to the movies.  And you've got three weeks to completely restructure it, any way you want.  Don't ask me my view cause I've shot my load. (laughs) You're my, (laughs), you're, you're my answer, and you no longer work.  So fix it."  And they did it.  And they did it, and I wasn't happy with it.  But everybody else was.  And I said to myself, "I've been here long enough.  I've been here long enough.  I've learned some things.  I've had some ethical challenges, okay, that I've met, all right.  I, I've, I'm very proud of having done the right thing when, when called upon to do the right thing.  But I can't do--I don't need to do this anymore."
Story_ID: 19457
Speaker 1: What were some of the ethical challenges that you had that you met?
Speaker 2: Barry Barnes came into my office one day and said, "Roy, we got a big one.  We've got a big fish.  He's engaging in antitrust violations, and we got him."  "Okay," and I said, "How do we have him?"  "Well, we've got this little fish, and the little fish will confess."  It turns out the little fish wouldn't confess, would not give up the big fish, okay.  His lawyer said to me, "Roy, if you promise not to go after my client, I'll give you the big fish."  I said, "You got a deal."  He said, "All right."  And we didn't go after him.  He gave up the big fish, and we got all the accolades with the big fish.  Six months later, they're doing the same thing.  So Barry goes after him, gives him a subpoena and says, "We're gonna lock you up for this."  He tells Barry, "Nah, nah, you can't.  I got transactional immunity from your boss."  So he calls me, and he says, "Roy--" and, and Barry comes to see me.  And Barry says, "Roy, because I care about you and because we're good friends, I'm gonna live with this deal, and we're gonna let this turkey go.  But you made a bad deal.  I didn't tell you, but we knew it at the time.  We could have gotten that turkey.  We didn't need his help to get the big guy."  He says, "You made a bad deal, but I'll live with it if you made the--since you made the deal.  But I'm not happy about that."  That's what Barry said to me.  So I called, I called the guy.  And the guy says, "Roy, you made the deal, buddy.  Tell your guys to back off."  And I said, "No."  He said, "Roy, you made the deal."  I said, "I made the deal for then.  I didn't mean for you to keep doing it.  You knew you were supposed to stop.  And they got you again, you're going down."  And he said, "I don't think so."  He said, "Because I don't think the [Federal Trade] Commission would like to know that the Regional Director of the New York office ever made the kind of deal you made with me.  You can't afford for me to make that public."  You know what my response was?  I said, "What the hell are you talking about?  If making that deal with you was a mistake, then it was a mistake."  I said, "You publicize.  What do you get?  One Regional Director.  I'll go find something else to do with my life, but you are going down, my friend, now."  And I hung up the phone.  And I was so proud that I, I didn't even think about it.  I didn't even think about, except to regret having ever made the deal (laughs) because I probably shouldn't have made that deal.  Barry was right that I shouldn't have made that deal.  But I'm not gonna compound it, okay.  He called up and he said, "Roy, I was only kidding ya; we're, we're not, we're not gonna say anything about that."  I said, "Look, you have reminded me, and I'm going to."  And I told Mike [Michael Pertschuk] that I had done that, okay.  And Mike said the same thing Barry said, "Roy, you can't make deals like that."  Well, now I know.  That was, that was one of them.  The other one was when, when--and I mentioned Barry because he walked in and he told me that he was gay.  And he was one of my best--one of my top performers.  And his boss was a guy that I had brought over with me from White and Case [LLP] and was a good friend.  And he was as homophobic as any human being alive.  Tough, tough situation, tough situation.  But again, my instincts were, were, were I, I hoped right, but they were very, very clear.  I said, "Thank you, Barry, for informing me."  I said, "Please don't screw anybody in the office." (laughs) And I, I called Bob in.  I said, "Bob, Barry just told me he's gay."  And Bob jumped up and walked over to the window and looking, and I, I went over there.  I said, "Bob, the reason I called you and told you myself is, if I have to choose, I'd choose Barry.  Understand, I want you to continue to do your job, but if you force me to choose, I'd choose Barry.  You've got to know that." And that happened within literally a five-minute timeframe.  And as I thought back on it, I said, boy, that was the right thing to do, and I, I'm so happy that wherever I got those instincts from, they clicked as quickly as they, as they did.  And, and I, you know, I did the right thing.
Story_ID: 19458
Speaker 1: So when did Chrysler [Corporation] come then, 'cause Chrysler came--that's 1983, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  Tom Ramser (ph.) was working on the Chrysler bailout--
Speaker 1: Let's--now, Tom Ramser--
Speaker 2: Is the White and Case partner--
Speaker 1: Partner who had been your mentor?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And he was working on the White and--on the Chrysler bailout.  And the General Counsel--
Speaker 1: Oh, and this is the Lee Iacocca days and everything.  Okay
Speaker 2: And the General Counsel, Dick Goodyear, said to him, boy, I'm looking for somebody to run labor shop.  And Tom says, I got the right guy, Roy Richie.  He's at the FTC [Federal Trade Commission].  He's been at White and Case.  He's great.  He's looking to get out too.  Dick walked into my office, looked around and said, "Well, I'll tell you this, when you work for me, your office won't be this big" (laughs).  And I introduced myself to him, and we started a dance.  Now, it turns out--and I'll tell this story, and then I have--then I'll leave, okay.  How's that?  It turns out that when I was at the FTC, I did--no, I won't this story.  I'll finish, I'll start with this story because it's a, it's just the story about our management of Jeep and, and me starting at Chrysler and, and the Vice President of, of--it's a wonderful story.  But I'll start with that one.
Story_ID: 19459
Speaker 1: I want to start out by slating it again.  And my name is Julieanna Richardson, and I'm the interviewer.  And Witold?
Speaker 2: Witold Janzek.
Speaker 1: --Janzek is the videographer.  And I'd like to have you by--start out--by stating your name and spelling it for us again and today's date?
Speaker 2: My name is Leroy Richie.  L-E-R-O-Y, R-I-C-H-I-E.  And today is July 30, 2003.
Speaker 1: And our location?
Speaker 2: Is 1900 S. Michigan Avenue, Chicago, Illinois, on the third floor.
Story_ID: 19460
Speaker 1: When we ended the, you know, our last interview, we were just at the point that you were leaving the FTC [Federal Trade Commission] .  And I'd like to start at that point--,
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and, you know, talk about how you came to end up going to Chrysler [Corporation], how that came about.
Speaker 2: I had been at the FTC for five years.  And the Republicans had taken over, and had made it clear that they didn't want me anymore.  The deal I made with them was that I could stay long enough to get my staff relocated, to help them find jobs, and then I would leave.  And I called my old law firm [White and Case LLP], and told them that I needed a job.  I didn't necessarily want to go back to the law firm.  But I, I would if I had to.  It turns out that one of the partners was a, was assigned to the Chrysler case, the Chrysler recovery case.  And he was working with the general counsel at Chrysler.  And the general counsel mentioned that he needed a senior legal manager.  And my mentor at the firm said, "Boy, have I got a solution for you."  They were in Washington [D.C.] when he said this.  And heading back to Detroit, they--Dick Goodyear, who was the general counsel, got off the plane, got on a plane to New York, flew to New York and walked into my office, and said, "Well, when you work for me, your office won't be this big."  And I said, "You assume I'm going to work for you?  Who are you?"  And he said, "My name is Dick Goodyear, and I'm from Chrysler Corporation.  Welcome on board." (laughs) And true enough, about four months later it happened, and I went to work for Chrysler.
Speaker 1: Now, let's just go back to one, one statement.  You said that I didn't really want to go back to White and Case, and why was that?  What had changed in that period of time?
Speaker 2: Oh, nothing had changed at White and Case.  It was--.
Speaker 1: But with you, and your experiences?
Speaker 2: The thing I, I did not know when I went to the FTC was how, how much I would enjoy managing people.  I found that an incredible experience.  And I didn't want to give that up.  If I could find a position that was both legal and managerial, then I wanted to do that.  And at Chrysler I could or at a company I could.  At a law firm, I really couldn't.
Speaker 1: And why do you think you had this sort of knack for managing people because nothing had really prepared you up to that point?
Speaker 2: I don't have a clue.  I, I have always attributed, attributed it to the personality that my father [Leroy Richie, Sr.] gave me.  I, I'm good with people.  And I, I always have been.
Story_ID: 19461
Speaker 1: It turns out that I'm good with people.  I'm a good listener.  I--during the five years that I spent at the FTC [Federal Trade Commission], very often I'd come in at seven o'clock in the morning, and grown men would be in my office crying about a personal problem that they were having or a woman was, would be asking me whether she should get pregnant or not or one of the guys who was gay wanted to discuss with me relationships that he was having, that he wanted to have with people in the office.  I mean it was--and, and for some reason, they trusted my, my sense of propriety, my judgment, my ability to give them good advice.  And, and I enjoyed it very, very much; much more than I anticipated.  And so I wanted to continue to do it if I could in my next job.  And that's not a law firm.  That, that was the only thing.  It wasn't--I loved White and Case [LLP].  And I had fun there, but I had more fun at Chrysler [Corporation].
Speaker 2: So let's talk about this.  So four months after, Mr. [Dick] Goodyear shows up in your office, you are at Chrysler--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So you move--now, what?  You go back and tell your wife [Julia Thomas Richie], "We're leaving, we're moving, I've gotten this offer?"  What is the--
Speaker 1: Well, it was actually fairly traumatic because Julia is a politician.  And she was, at the time, running for Union County [New Jersey] Freeholder.  And, as you may know, she's a Republican.  I'm not, but she is a Republican.  And the, the Republican fathers had designated her--she ran for city council in Plainfield [New Jersey] and lost by ninety-nine votes, from a standing start.  She ran a, an incredible race and lost by ninety-nine votes.  And it impressed them very much in a completely Democratic town.  So they, they designated her as the next Freeholder.  And at the convention, they nominated her on the first ballot.  And it was, it was a classic backroom deal because there was a sitting Freeholder that she had to, had to beat for the nomination.  And she did.  So she was running for Freeholder, and--which is a Union County manager.  And I walked in the house and announced that I'd been offered a job at Chrysler in Detroit--that's in Michigan as you may know.  And I wanted to take it.  She said, "Okay, I will join you after the election, but I want to be elected and then designate my successor."  And I said, "Well, what about the kids?  I mean, what about their school?"  And she said, "Well, they'll just have to transfer school in the middle of the, in the middle of the semester, but I want to do this."  And I said, "Well, Julia, how will you answer the question, 'Where's your husband?'", because this was announced in every newspaper in New Jersey, that I was leaving the FTC.  And I'd, and I'd received this offer.  And she said, "Well, I'll just say my private business is my private business."  And we tried that for a while at a couple of coffees.  It didn't work.  And I, I remember the day she concluded that she would have to drop out of the race.  And it was not a happy moment in her life because that was very important to her.  It validated for her, all of the ambitions that she had because she had stopped--she had left Arthur Andersen [LLP], you know, when, when our daughter was born.  And, as you may know, she's not a woman to stay home and just raise kids.  I mean she's always worked harder than I did.  So it was not easy for her to, to make that, make that decision.  But we made it, and she appointed a successor who ran and won.  And we went to Michigan.  I went out August 1st to start the job.  And she went out, she came out September 1st.
Speaker 2: And this August 1st of what year?
Speaker 1: Of 1983.
Story_ID: 19462
Speaker 1: Let's talk about the Chrysler [Corporation] that you came to.  Can you sort of paint a picture of the state of Chrysler at that point, Lee Iacocca  there.  I'm just wanting to set a context.
Speaker 2: Lee Iacocca had been at Chrysler four years when I, when I got there.  And he was in the process of replacing every officer, except one.  And it took a couple of years, after I'd been there a couple of years when he completed that process.  But it was--I, I joined the company right in the middle of that.  We had--I joined the company six days after we repaid the billion dollar loan guarantee from the federal government.  So we were on our own, and trying to make money.  It was a year before the minivan was created.  We, we, as you may know, Chrysler invented the minivan and had that market exclusively for two or three years.  And this was a year before it was, it was created.  I was asked my opinion because, on the safety of it, because I had just left the Federal Trade Commission [FTC], and we had just sued Jeep.  My office had sued Jeep because of their rollover propensity, the alleged rollover propensity.  And so, and my view was that Jeep had a high center of gravity, and that would--that contributed to the problem.  And so I was asked to look at the mini-van to see whether it had the similar issue.  And it did not.
Speaker 1: Now, just create a context though also for, you know, the financial shape of Chrysler at that time.  Was it, you know, you're saying it, you know, a year they--well, they had just completed the buy-out, I mean the--
Speaker 2: The repayment of the--
Speaker 1: Repayment.
Speaker 2: It was not financially strong.  Everyone was still getting paid in paper, I mean in options.  There were no salary increases.  A year after I got there, I received my first bonus, and it was pretty small.  But then Chrysler became increasingly strong over the, over the next several years.
Speaker 1: Now, the legal department, what was its structure within the organization and who had been your predecessor, and--?
Speaker 2: I didn't have a predecessor.  They created a job for me.  Dick Goodyear believed that if you hired smart people--he, he, his philosophy was hire smart people, and they will find a job for themselves.  And it will work out.  And so he hired me to manage labor relations.  Now, he had a vice president--no, he had an assistant general counsel for personnel and labor.  He split that position and gave me the position of assistant general counsel for labor.  And I had two people reporting to me.  It didn't make a lot of sense.  He knew it didn't make a lot of sense.  He had nine Assistant general counsels reporting to him, nine Assistant general counsels.  And the first job he gave me was restructuring the law department and telling him how it ought to work.  And we, we agreed that several of those positions had to be eliminated.  And you had to consolidate that.  Nine months later, I was promoted to associate general counsel.  There were two associate general counsel positions created.  And I got one, and a fellow named Bill O'Brien got the other.  He was chief international lawyer.  He had the international lawyers and the purchasing lawyers working for him.  And I had all of--he was chief international lawyer and I was chief domestic lawyer.  I had litigation and marketing and employee relations and all of those things.  And he had purchasing, contracts and, and international law.  So we split it in two.
Story_ID: 19463
Speaker 1: Now, you're saying you were given a task of looking at, you know, the structure and making some recommendations [at Chrysler Corporation].  What did you look at and how were the divisions, you know, I know you said that [Bill] O'Brien got moved up through international [law], but what were the existing--
Speaker 2: Well, he was doing international.
Speaker 1: He was doing international.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, but what were the divisions between these nine?
Speaker 2: I can't tell you all of the, the nine, but they, but, but basically, employee relations was, was separate from marketing was separate from dealer, lawyers were separate.  They just had all of the lawyers.  We had about 130 lawyers, and they had them divided up into nine boxes, some of which made sense; some of which didn't.  We had litigation divided in three different ways, with three assistant general counsels responsible for litigation.  It just didn't make, it didn't make a lot of sense.  And so Dick [Goodyear] asked me--because I had virtually nothing to do, to, to take a look at it and make some recommendations.  Now, I do need to say that when he hired me, I said to him, "Dick, do not hire me to do marketing law because I don't want to do marketing law.  Is that clear?"  He said, "Oh, yeah.  No, I'm hiring you to do labor relations, not marketing."  Three months after he hired--I, I remember this because I, I was standing in my, in my family room on a Sunday afternoon, about five o'clock and the phone rang.  And he said, "Roy, on Saturday, yesterday, I met with Bob Talbert Stern (ph.)," who was chief of the marketing section of the law department.  He said, "And Bob and I agreed that he would step down from his position.  He's not leaving the department immediately.  But he is stepping down from his position.  And so, I need someone to take his job as assistant general counsel for, for dealer and marketing.  And I thought about you, and I wanted to ask you if you would take that position?"  I said, "Dick, you do recall that I asked you not to give me that--not to hire me for that position."  He said, "Yes, Roy, and I didn't, I did not hire you for that position.  This is completely fortuitous."  I said, "It is?"  "Well, Roy, would you take the job?"  I said, "Dick, I'm standing here talking to the only boss I have, looking around me, the only home I own.  It's in Detroit, Michigan, and we're talking about the only job I have.  I'd love to take that job."  He says, "Roy, thank you so much.  I really appreciate that," as if I had a choice.  And I said, "Will Bob remain in the department?"  "Yes, Roy, he will, if you want him.  Now, if you don't want him, then you need to get rid of him.  But, if not, he would, he will remain in the department."  And I took over marketing.  And with, with the former manager in the department, he had hired everyone else in the department.  And they did not like the fact that he was, he was being fired.  But we had a good time, really.
Speaker 1: Did he stay in the department?
Speaker 2: Yes, he did.  He stayed in the department for a year and a half.
Speaker 1: And now why were you so, why were you so closed to taking marketing?  Were you concerned about your path within the corporate--?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't know anything about it.  I didn't know anything about marketing law or dealer law.  I, I wasn't an auto lawyer.  And I wanted time to learn it before I took it over.  And he threw me in it, and I learned by fire.  It was, it was not easy, but I asked Bob to teach me.  And Bob taught me.
Speaker 1: And you were able to manage that relationship too, with--?
Speaker 2: Oh, I didn't think that would be difficult to me, and it was not difficult for me.  And I helped him a lot in dealing with the fact that he had been, he had been fired, and helping him to understand why and what his best response to that was for, for his life, you know.  And I--we had, we had a good time.  We really did have a, have a good time.
Speaker 1: So tell me what, this is within your first six months--,
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, of being at Chrysler.
Story_ID: 19464
Speaker 1: So are you still doing labor at this point and, or are you doing mainly marketing [at Chrysler Corporation]?
Speaker 2: No, I'm doing both.  I'm doing labor and marketing.  In fact, over Christmas of that year, I was in, over Christmas of '83 [1983], I was in Milwaukee [Wisconsin] because we sold the boat company.  We sold--we owned a boat company, and we sold it in December of '83 [1983].  And the union [United Automobile Workers] blocked us, got an injunction against the sale because we had not given them the sixty-day plant-closing notice that we were required by the law to give them because it was our view that it wasn't a plant closing.  It was their view that it was a plant closing.  And therefore, they were entitled to the notice, and they found a judge who agreed with them, at least on preliminary basis, and issued an injunction against that.  So I was sent to Milwaukee with a million dollars in my pocket to solve the union problem.  And I, I had to take one of the labor relations guys with me.  And we had a ball, had a good time.  I learned a lot about labor relations, made a very good friend, Tom Gallagher, who, who remains a friend today.  And he taught me plant politics.  He taught me labor relations, I mean over a two-week period, just before Christmas of '83, every night we'd go back to the hotel.  We'd get these peel 'em--'you peel-'em' shrimp and beer and we'd--just the two of us would sit in the bar.  And he would educate me.  He, his boss and my boss did not get along.  So my boss told me, "Roy, this is a legal show.  You run it."  His boss told him, "Do not let this turkey screw it up." (laughs) So we walked in the law firm in Milwaukee, when I walked in the law firm, he was there already.  I introduced myself to him because we hadn't met before.  And I said, "Well, let's meet with the union."  He says, "No, we don't want to meet with the union yet."  And I said--we were the two senior Chrysler officials there, and I said, "You and I should talk outside for just a moment."  And we went outside, and I explained to him that I was running this show.  And he needed to get comfortable with that.  And he said, "I'm perfectly comfortable with it.  We're just not gonna meet with the union."  I said, "Why not?"  He said, "Because it doesn't make sense."  And he explained to me in graphic detail why it didn't make sense.  And I said, "I've got a million dollars to spend, and I'm going to spend it."  He said, "No, you're not."  I said, "Why?"  And he said, his answer was, "Roy, they don't care about your money.  They want a contract from the buyer.  And until the buyer gives them a contract, they're not gonna deal with us.  Now, once they get the contract from the buyer, and the buyer will be forced over the next thirty days to give them a contract, once they get a contract from the buyer, then they'll want to negotiate with us.  And any offer you've made them, that's where it will start.  If you've offered them $50,000, it'll start at fifty.  If you've offered them the whole million, it'll start at a million.  But until they get that contract, you're irrelevant.  There's no point to meeting with them, and do not make them any offer."  I said, "I have to make them some offer."  And we agreed--because he was right, and he knew it and once he said to me, I knew it.  We agreed I could offer them $75,000.  They were insulted by my offer, and they walked out of the room.  My boss was livid.  He was screaming over the phone because he wanted me to offer them the whole million.

Speaker 1: So you say in December of '83 [1983]--
Speaker 2: Right.  I went to Milwaukee [Wisconsin] to solve this, solve this problem.  And I met Tom Gallagher and learned the way the real world worked in labor relations and in the auto industry.
Speaker 1: But can you talk about this, I think we were was the offer of $75,000 on the table and [Dick] Goodyear furious.
Speaker 2: When we walked out of Jerry [Gerald] Greenwald's office--Jerry Greenwald was vice chair.  And he looked at Tom Minor, who was labor relations vice president and Dick Goodyear, okay, and he said, "Goodyear, this is your problem to solve.  Go get it fixed."  And Dick said, "Okay."  And he, he--Dick took me outside, and he said, "Roy, we've got a million dollars.  I'm sending you to fix this problem, okay.  It's a legal problem.  It's not a labor relations problem.  Go fix it."  And I went to Milwaukee and found out very quickly that it was not a legal problem.  It was a labor relations problem.  And Tom Gallagher said--I mean many things he taught me during the two weeks we were there together, but the essence of it was, the union [United Autombile Workers] didn't care about Chrysler [Corporation].  The union cared about a contract with the purchaser.  Once they got that contract with the purchaser, then they would focus on Chrysler.  And in order to get the injunction lifted, in order to get the injunction dissolved, for, for them to stop their opposition to the injunction, they'd be willing to negotiate a settlement with us.  But the settlement that they would negotiate with us would--the negotiations would start at whatever dollar level I had put on the table.  If I had put a million dollars on the table, then it would start at a million dollars and go, and go up from there.  If I had put $50,000 on the table, it would start at fifty thousand and go up from there.  Once I became convinced that Tom was right, they weren't even gonna talk to us until they got their contract.  And then once they got their contract, then they'd sit down and start from where I made an offer.  We agreed that I could offer them $75,000 in an effort not to--not to insult them.  He didn't care about insulting them, but I prevailed upon him that I had to offer them something.  And so he agreed the seventy--that I could throw away $75,000 of Chrysler's money.  I offered them $75,000.  They were insulted.  They walked out of the room.  My boss was absolutely livid.  He was pounding the phone.  He was so, he was so mad that I hadn't followed his instructions and offered them a million dollars.  And I simply said to him, "Dick, you're not here; I am.  This is my call, is it not?"  He said, "Well, yes it is."  I said, "Thank you very much.  We'll get this done, and we'll get it done the right way."  And we did get it done the right way.  The boat company finally said, "Okay, you can have a contract," and negotiated a contract with them.  They then called and said, "Okay, let's continue our negotiations."  And when Tom said to them, "Those negotiations that you had before don't matter, we're starting all over."  The union's response was, "No, we're not.  We're starting--we've been offered $75,000.  That's unacceptable.  Let's go from there."  And it would have been, "We've been offered a million; let's go from there."  And so Tom was absolutely right.  And the relationship we ended up with was, he was the client, and I was acting as his lawyer.  And that was the appropriate relationship.  He was comfortable with that.  I was, and, and that was the best relationship to get the job done.  I did, I did tell him in no uncertain terms though, I mean I was clear about one thing, and that was that if we won, which we did, that I would get all the credit since it was a legal problem as defined by my boss. (laughs)
Speaker 1: And Tom was okay with that, though he had tutored you well (laughs).
Speaker 2: (Laughs) Tom made a remark that his, his tutoring would show through. (laughs) And we, we became and, and remained pretty good friends.  And it worked out well because I absolutely screwed him to the wall later after I became a vice president, and then two years later, he became a vice president, okay.  And so we were again operating on the same level.  And there came a time when I had to make a call, and I made the call, and it just put him under the bus, just threw him right under the bus.  And, and I called him to try to explain how it happened.  And he said, "Well, can you fix it?"  And I said, "Yes, I can."  And he said, "Roy, you don't need to explain.  I know you weren't trying to do it."  And it was simply the relationship we had that didn't, didn't cause him to say, "This guy's out to get me," okay, 'cause there were vice presidents at Chrysler--and I suspect every other company--where those relationships don't exist.
Speaker 1: So Tom was--correct me, he was in labor relations?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, so--
Speaker 2: He actually--the end of the Tom story is that before he left Chrysler, he left three years after I did.  Before he left Chrysler, he hired my son in labor relations.
Story_ID: 19466
Speaker 1: So you're four months on the job [at Chrysler Corporation], and you have a victory.  You come back from Milwaukee [Wisconsin]--you know, victorious.  Now, what is the process, you know, when we get into, you know, early '84 [1984]?  What are the issues on the table?  You're still getting learn--you're still learning the marketing area?
Speaker 2: Well, let me, let me, just one other thing.  I got a call December 27th, 1983.  I'm sitting at home, and I got a call from an assistant controller, okay, in the finance department.  And he told me that one of the, one of the tanks in, in--I can't remember the circumstances exactly now, but we were leaking an environmentally hazardous fluid into the ground, okay, in someone's backyard in Birmingham, Michigan--I can't--not, not in Birmingham, somewhere in Michigan, but in someone's backyard, okay.  And the EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] had come in and said, this can be harmful to the health of the people in the yard.  What are you going to do about it Chrysler?  Okay, and Tom--this was a very sensitive time financially for Chrysler, but Tom wanted to--this wasn't Tom Gallagher.  This, his, his name was, this assistant controller's name was Tom too.  He wanted to get diggers out there and dig the--dig the ground up.  I mean, and it was a very expensive solution.  But he wanted to dig the ground up.  He didn't want to take any chances, but he didn't, he didn't think he had the authority to do that, okay.  And I said, "Do it," over the phone, once I became convinced that we had the problem he, he said we had.  "Do it."  He said, "What about the money?"  I said, "Do it, and we'll worry about the money later."  And that turned out to be exactly the right call to make.  Another situation I had, I'm sitting in my office in November of '83 [1983], and I get a call from the fellow in charge of our (unclear) Italy station, okay.  And he is--over there, there's a dealer trip in Italy.  And one of the dealer's wives has broken his--her leg.  Okay, she broke her leg several hours ago, according to him.  And she refused to go to a hospital, okay.  And the next plane didn't leave for the United States for another seven or eight hours.  And the dealer said, "Charter a plane, get my wife back to the United States so that she can go to a hospital because she will not go to an Italian hospital."  And he called me in the legal department because he was unclear about the insurance coverage and whether the dealer had to pay for the plane or Chrysler had to pay for the plane.  And since he wasn't authorized for Chrysler to pay for the plane, and the dealer was--he wasn't even addressing the issue.  I mean he wouldn't even discuss who would pay for the plane, okay, he needed some authority from me--well, he didn't, he needed an explanation from me.  He did not call me for authority.  He couldn't get in touch with anyone else.  So he called me.  My answer to him was, on the phone, in the moment, I said, "Listen, turkey, charter a plane, get that woman back here to the United States; get her some medical help that's acceptable to her.  And then we'll worry about who pays for it later.  But don't spend one second addressing that issue before you get her some medical help.  And create a record that you got that medical help just as soon as you possibly could.  Is that clear?"  He said, "That's clear.  Your name is?"  And I gave him my name and my title.  He said, "Thank you, sir," hung up the phone and did it.  And by the time we got to March of '84 [1984], Dick [Goodyear] walked into my office, my boss walked into my office and said, "Roy, I hired Bill O'Brien to replace me.  And I'm now gonna create an associate general counsel's position to make it clear to the rest of the staff who's number two in the department.  And I just wanted to make sure you were comfortable with that."  I said, "Well, Dick, I got to tell you the truth.  I'm not."  I said, "I, I certainly want to compete for a vice presidency."  I said, "In order to do that, I need to be an associate general counsel too.  So my, my preference would be that you create two of them."  He said, "I thought that would be your position.  Congratulations."  And he handed me an associate general counsel position (laughs).  I'd been in the department since August.  This was March.  The bad news was they couldn't pay me.  The Chrysler system did not permit them to give me a raise that, that soon after starting.  So I had to wait until August.  But then I got a hell of a bump in August.  But things worked out fairly well.  Two years later--well, I need to--
Speaker 1: Well, could I ask--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --as Associate General Counsel now, what were the areas you were involved in?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was chief domestic lawyer and Bill was chief international lawyer.
Story_ID: 19467
Speaker 1: So I had all litigation, and I had employee relations.  I had dealer, all the dealer lawyers worked for me.  I mean I had--we had 180 lawyers in the place.  Bill [O'Brien] had thirty and I had a hundred and fifty.
Speaker 2: Yet, Bill was still his appointed heir or was that changing?
Speaker 1: Well, that was changing.
Speaker 2: It was changing, okay, okay.
Speaker 1: Well, what happened was, Chrysler [Corporation] decided in, in January of '86 [1986] Chrysler decided to split the company to create a car company and a holding company, which gave them more flexibility in terms of buying and selling different assets, non-car assets.
Speaker 2: Like what?
Speaker 1: A holding, a bank holding company, an aircraft company, a technology company, all of which Chrysler did then.  But what, what happened was, they were creating a Chrysler vice presidency to be another legal vice presidency for the car company.  So that the next vice presidency in the legal department was not going to be Dick [Goodyear]'s replacement, but a separate vice presidency reporting to the car company, okay.  And they intended to split the legal department in two so that the holding company would have twenty-two, twenty-three lawyers.  And the operating company would have 160, 170 lawyers.  So that vice presidency they were creating, okay.  And the question was whether Dick was, was going to get it or whether he--they were gonna go outside and hire someone or whether they were gonna hire from inside.  Dick walked into my office in January of, of '86 [1986]--this was two years after they had promoted me to associate general counsel, and said that he had just met with the executive committee of the company.  And they had decided, in their infinite wisdom that they were going to make, they were going promote from inside.  They were not gonna go outside and, and, and get that vice presidency, and that Dick had taken himself out of the running.  So that it was between me and Bill, and that he would make the call.  He wished me luck, and he left my office.  Dick graduated from Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut], as did Bill. Three months later, Dick decided, "It's Bill."  But he was too late because every other vice president in the place said, "Wrong," and went to Lee Iacocca and said, "Lee, that's the wrong decision.  It's Roy."  And Lee decided it was me.  Dick wasn't happy about that, but I suspect by now he's gotten over it.  He's had twenty years so he's gotten over it.  I think the single thing that happened during that period of time was this, I'm sitting in my office.  The day that we have a shareholders' meeting in New York, Dick and Bill are going to the shareholders' meeting.  Dick always goes, and he's taking Bill with him, not me.  This is in May of '86 [1986], okay.  I am on my way to Washington [D.C.] to try to settle and EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] problem that we're having, okay, where they, they are willing to settle the problem, but they're gonna charge us a million dollars.  And, and Jerry [Gerald] Greenwald called me into his office and said, "Roy, three years ago, that would have been insane because we didn't have the money.  Now, that we have the money, I'm not paying a million dollars.  Get that fixed.  I'm not gonna pay a million dollars.  Get that fixed."  And so he sent me to Washington to fix that.  So I came into the office because my plane left at 10:30 [A.M.], okay.  It's now nine o'clock in the morning.  I need to leave at 9:30 to get to the airport.  Okay, car's waiting to take me to the airport, and the phone rings.  And it's Lee Iacocca.  And Lee says, "Roy, got a group of shareholders here.  There's a problem with the plane.  It's still in the air, and Goodyear is not here, and I need some answers.  I've got three questions."  And he had three questions related to stock--.
Story_ID: 19468
Speaker 1: He's [Lee Iacocca] got me on the phone, and he's asking me these, and I'm writing the questions down, okay.  And he says, "Roy, I need the answers as soon as you can get them to me."  I said, "Lee, you'll have the answers in thirty minutes."  He says, "That's great."  I said thirty minutes because that's all the time I had and still make my plane.  So I picked up the phone, and I called Dickinson Wright [PLLC], got a hold of a woman named Beth Duncombe.  And I said, "Beth, you got twenty minutes to get the answers to me."  And she got the answers to me in twenty minutes, and she called up.  She dictated them to my secretary.  My secretary ran in with the answers, I mean written out.  I edited them, got them back to him; put them on the fax machine and didn't even wait for a response.  Faxed them to him.  He was waiting by the fax machine to walk into an analyst meeting, and he had, had--and he had to know the answers before he did.  He grabbed them from the fax machine and just--and was walking down the hall reading them, okay.  I'm in a cab, heading for Washington [D.C.].  When I got to Washington, my plane landed at noon.  And I walk into the Washington Airport, and I get a call, a page.  I walk over to one of the page phones, and it is Glenn White, who's vice president of personnel and who was in New York with Lee.  The meeting is now over.  The answers have been given, and Glenn called me to thank me, from Lee, for, for responding to him so quickly and so well.  And he just--he was incredibly effusive in his praise.  A month later, he called me and said, on June 10th, my wedding anniversary, June 10th, 1986, he called me, he said, "Roy, congratulations. You've just been elected the first black vice president of Chrysler Corporation."  I said, "Thank you very much, Lee."  It was an incredible experience.
Story_ID: 19469
Speaker 1: I had come to Detroit [Michigan] in 1983, August of 1983 and I can't say that I was that well accepted.  I had made a few friends in Detroit, but Detroit had not embraced me.  And I guess I'd began to believe that this was my victory, that I had done this pretty much on my own, that I had, you know, that I was smart and tough and in the right place at the right time.  And without the support of the community, I had won this battle.  Something changed--something happened to change my mind.  And what happened was, I received, in the next--it was announced in the paper.  It was in paper.  Jerry [Gerald] Greenwald called me to tell me that Francis Kornegay, who was the, then President of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] in, in--of the Urban League in Detroit called him and cried on the phone, thanking him for making me a vice president.  My house looked like a, a funeral parlor, my home and my office.  I received over a hundred plants, flowers, terrariums, I mean over a hundred.  I, I didn't know where, I didn't know what to do with them.  I, I--they were just lined up in my house and on--you, you couldn't, on the table in my office, you couldn't get any more flowers, plants, gifts.  A young woman who, who was the wife of a friend I'd come to know, saw me in the grocery store, and walked over and just start hugging me and crying.  I, the cards and letters that I got that, that Jerry Greenwald got, that Lee Iacocca got, were, were three or four hundred telegrams.  He allowed me to do three interviews for newspapers.  Tom [E. Thomas] Pappard who, who was Vice President of the U.S. auto sales and one of my best advisors, then told me, "That's enough. (laughs) You don't want to compete with Lee," and no one competed with Lee.  It simply overwhelmed me.  And the message that I got, the very clear message was that I was not in this alone.  This was not just my victory.  The--I was closer--the, the image that emerged in my own mind was the image of a tortoise on a fence post.  However high he is and however wonderful it is to be there, you know he didn't get there alone.  And I know I didn't get there alone.  And I had come to this conclusion that this--and shared it with my wife [Julia Thomas Richie] and had, and had really, you know, chastised myself a little bit for the, for the initial feeling I had.  But I had fully reached this conclusion, and I was sharing it with Greenwald, you know, that this really was a victory for the, for the black community as much as for me, you know, and, and I wanted to thank him for his part in it.  And Jerry started laughing.  And I said, "What, what's funny?"  He says, "Roy, you, you don't know about the, the, the star, do you?"  I said, "The star?"  He says, "Well, we, remember we, we went to Italy in, in November.  Lee and I took a, took a dealer trip to Italy?"  I said, "Yeah."  "And we were on the, we were on the, the water on a boat, and we were dancing and having a ball. And the two of us were standing at the rail talking when Jesse Jones, who was our only black dealer at the time, walked over to have a conversation with us.  And Lee immediately started complaining to Jesse that, my, you know, there were, that there were no black executives ready for promotion in the company.  And Jesse said, 'What, are you crazy?  Why would you say that?  You've got Roy Richie sitting there with, with, with all the hair he needs on him, with all the experience he needs.  Why don't you promote him?'  And Lee said, 'Let me think about that.'"  And five months later, I was promoted.  Now, did Jesse do it?  Did I do it?  Was it a combination of things?  One thing is clear, I didn't do it alone.  I know that.  And that, that really did inform my vice presidency because I never did believe that I was there just for Lee.  I really made an effort, while I was the Vice President of Chrysler, to share the wealth, to hire black lawyers, black staff, to give work to black lawyers though, you know, they had to be good.  They had to be competent.  There's no question about that, but I think if you ask people, they will tell you that I, I did, I did a lot for the black legal community in Chrysler, I mean in, in Detroit, and, and around the country.  I ran the--the--Dennis Archer started the Minority Counsel Demonstration program.  Now, when he left that chair, I took it over, and ran it.  I was personally responsible for over 250 participants, participating companies.  I personally recruited over 250 companies.  They, they would sit--we had a, we had a, we contacted a law firm in a town, in Seattle [Washington], contacted a law firm in Seattle that the ABA [American Bar Association] knew and asked them to set up meeting with the general counsels of the ten top companies in town.  I would fly in, have dinner with the lawyers, with the law firm, and then the next morning, I would start visiting those companies.  And I would visit ten companies.  And out of ten, I'd get six or seven participants.  And I'd leave town three days later, come home and spend a couple of weeks and fly to Houston [Texas], do the same thing.  Los Angeles [California], do the same thing, flew all over the country, recruiting companies to participate in the Minority Counsel Demonstration program.
Story_ID: 19470
Speaker 1: The [Detroit, Michigan] community all comes out.  You're appointed, I mean you're selected, hired [as Vice President at the Chrysler Corporation].  And this is a new position, right.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.
Speaker 1: It's a new, it's--
Speaker 2: It's a new company.
Speaker 1: It's a company with, okay.  What are the expectations of this company?  And tell me--
Speaker 2: Oh, this is just a car company, just to keep doing the car business.  And, and we--
Speaker 1: So are your responsibilities much different than they were before?
Speaker 2: My personnel responsibilities were a lot different because I didn't have any before.  I just had legal responsibilities.  Legally, I picked up a couple of--I had the patent office that I hadn't had before.  So I got a couple of other organizations.  Politically, Dick [Goodyear] wasn't happy with the split, and something happened immediately after that, that just--we bought AMC [American Motors Corporation], okay.  We bought it from the French.  And Dick walked into my office one morning, 'cause I didn't know anything about it because it wasn't an operating company issue.  The holding company had bought AMC.  But they were folding it in to the operating company, okay.  So he walked into my office one Monday morning, and said, "Come on, let's go visit AMC."  "Okay."  So we take off, and we go up.  And we begin the process of integrating these two companies.  So then we had a meeting.  And [Gerald] Greenwald was in charge of the integration because they were, they were gonna be in his company.  And he looked at me and said, "Roy, I want you to be responsible for due diligence."  And Dick said, "Nah, it's okay, Jerry.  I got that."  And Jerry said, "No, I want Roy to do it."  And Dick said, "Well, we'll, we'll talk after the meeting."  And so after the meeting, Dick went right to Lee [Iacocca] and said, "Lee, this is a holding company issue.  I want to do this."  Lee said, "Dick, go work it out with Jerry.  I don't want to even know about this."  And Jerry said, "Dick, I've already told you I want Roy to do it.  It's Roy's responsibility.  He might like you to help him, but it's his responsibility."  And our relationship never was the same after that.  And three months later, Dick left the company.
Story_ID: 19471
Speaker 1: So, Dick [Goodyear], he leave--okay, so he left the company [Chrysler Corporation], okay.
Speaker 2: It's, it's, it's incredible--let me tell you one Jerry [Gerald] Greenwald story.  We were building the plant in--this is a good story too.  It'll take a little, minute to set it up, but I'll, I want it, I want you to understand this.  We were building the plant, the Jefferson Avenue North Plant in Detroit [Michigan], okay.  Now, when we started building that plant, we agreed with the city what product we'd put in there.  And we agreed that we'd put our, one of our new trucks in there, okay.  And that's what we were gonna make in, in the Jefferson Avenue Plant.  And we agreed on the date that it would be, and we agreed that Christmas of '92 [1992] we would be ready.  We'd build the, what's called the A-275 truck.  Well, then we go off and buy AMC [American Motors Corporation].  And, you know, we, we had a planning document that represented our strategic plan.  And it said, in the strategic plan, A-275 truck, the Jefferson North at Christmas '92--the 12, 12/92.  Well, I knew that way down deep in the bowels of engineering, the guys were beginning to conclude we didn't need two trucks and that AMC had a better truck than we had.  So maybe we would do the AMC truck, not the A-275.  The strategic plan said we're gonna do the A-275, but the guys down there that make the plan were beginning to think, well, we're not gonna do that.  Well, I gave Jerry--Jerry met with us to sign the contract with the city.  And in the contract, it said, build the A-275 truck by December of '92 [1992].  And he looked at us on Friday, this was a Friday.  And he looked at everybody in the room.  He had the pen in his hand.  He said, "Can I sign this?"  Personnel said, "Yes."  Community Relations said, "Yes."  He got to Legal, I said, "Jerry, I, I don't think you can sign it."  He said, "Why?"  I said, "It, it might be fraudulent."  He looked at the pen, then he looked at me, and he tossed the pen at me.  He says, he tossed it to me.  I know he tossed it at me.  He said, "I'll sign it on Monday morning."  And he got up and walked out.  Nobody said a word to me.  They just got up and left, and I got my papers together, and I walked out of his conference room, past his office to get to the hall.  And he's sitting in his office.  And he says, "Roy, come here."  And I walked in.  He said, "Don't ever let that happen to me again.  Do you understand me?  Don't ever put me in that position again."  I said, "Jerry, it, I, I apologize, but at that moment, I only had one choice."  He said, "Then create some different ones.  Goodbye."  One other Jerry Greenwald story.  This happened before I was promoted, okay.  We had a little company that used--a van pool company, okay.  When we stopped selling the big vans, we created a van pool, okay, where we'd hire--where people would take vans and go around and pick up people to take them to work.  And we called these van pools, okay.  We created a company, van pool company.  All right, and we used to make them buy vans every three months.  So we kept selling the vans.  I mean it was great.  And we used our insurance to cover so it really worked.  But it stopped working as well after about four years.  And somebody wanted to buy the van pool company.  And because we had, we had personnel, we had, what, fifty people working in the van pool company, and it was under marketing.  And the, and the marketing V.P. [vice presient], Ben Bidwell, had to get rid of fifty people, the easiest fifty people to get rid of are the van pool people, okay.  That way he doesn't mess up his organization and all.  And we started a van pool company.  When we wanted to sell it to another good friend, Carroll Shelby. Shelby wanted to buy it.  And I said, "No."  I said, "Jerry, you can't sell that."  And he said, "Ben, this is Ben's call, not mine, Roy."  He said, "If Ben wants to sell, let him sell it."  I went back to him.  I said, "Jerry, that's a mistake.  That's a mistake."  He said, "Roy, I've told you this is Ben's call, and we're gonna let him do this.  Do you understand me?"  I said, "Yes, Jerry."  I left.  I called for another meeting with him, third meeting with him.  And I said, "Jerry, it's a mistake.  You can't do it."  And he went off the page, called Steve Miller, who was the CFO [chief financial officer] and said, "Steve, would you take a look at this transaction, selling the pool, the van pool company?"  Steve said, "Yes."  "Roy, I've had it.  Do you understand me?  Steve, take a look at it.  Whatever decision you make is fine."  I said, "Okay."  And I walked out.  Steve took a look at it and came back and said, "Jerry, it would have been the biggest mistake of our lives to sell the van pool company." (laughs)
Speaker 1: And why was that?
Speaker 2: Because it was a money maker, and because if we sold it, we couldn't control production.  We needed--the only reason we needed the van pool, the company was selling--we could smooth out production.  If the market stopped buying the big vans, then we'd sell them to the van pool company.  And we could determine that whenever we wanted to.  We'd lose that ability if we sold it.

Speaker 1: So Jerry [Gerald Greenwald] and you became a true team?
Speaker 2: We--Jerry really began to rely on me.  And he knew he could trust me.  He knew he could trust my judgment, and he, he knew that I, I was loyal to him.  And so he wanted me to do his, his dirty work, I mean to do the due diligence.  And it caused [Dick] Goodyear a good deal of heartbreak, I mean heartache.  And he eventually left the company [Chrysler Corporation].
Speaker 1: So why did Goodyear, so just because Goodyear's role had been minimized as it relates to the car company--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, dramatically.  Okay, now, why did Good--what was the, sort of the difference between, you know, Jerry and, what's [Bill] O'Brien--
Speaker 2: Bill?
Speaker 1: Bill, yeah.  What was the difference between them?
Speaker 2: Between Jerry and Bill?
Speaker 1: Yeah, in terms of, you know--because Bill had brought you into the company?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Dick had brought me in, Dick Goodyear.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I meant to say Dick, I'm sorry, Dick, I'm sorry.  Okay, Jerry and Dick, okay.  What was the difference between them?
Speaker 2: Jerry was Vice Chairman and he was Lee Iacocca's boy (laughs).
Speaker 1: But I'm talking about even as mentors so to speak.
Speaker 2: Jerry was, Jerry was a car guy.  He was calm, he was--you know, Jerry took over United Airlines [Corporation].  That's the Jerry Greenwald, yeah, no, he, he was a big-time player in saving Chrysler.  And he was Lee Iacocca's right-hand man.  He, he should have taken over Chrysler when, when Lee stepped down, but it wasn't to be.  He had given up that dream and moved on.  But, yeah, and, and Goodyear, he was a little too political.  I mean he was very, very political.  And, you know, I had my own brand of politics.  You know, I, I knew, you know, I went to [Tom] Pappard (ph.) and I went to George Butts, and I went to other VPs [vice presidents] and, you know, said, "I need your support."  And they said, "You got it.  Now, what do we do?"  I said, "Tell Greenwald."  And they did.  And so, I, I would have been comfortable with Dick being in charge of integrating AMC [American Motors Corporation].  I was also comfortable doing it myself.  But I didn't, I didn't want him to leave the company like that.  And he, he did.  And it left a bitter taste in his mouth.  We've not spoken since he left the company, you know.
Speaker 1: Where did he go?
Speaker 2: I have no idea.
Story_ID: 19473
Speaker 1: You were talking about working with Dennis Archer on the Minority Counsel Demonstration program.  And I want you to talk about what that program was.
Speaker 2: It was a program.  We started out with seven law firms, seven majority law firms, twenty-one minority law firms, and seven clients, seven companies.  And it was a program designed to demonstrate to corporate America that black attorneys could do as, as good a legal job for them as white companies could.  It, it had two components.  One was black firms, and the second part was black lawyers in, in major firms.  And I basically concluded that, you know, the real difference was between large and small.  You're not gonna give a small law firm work that's inappropriate for them.  I don't care what color they are.  If you've got comp--small-firm work, you ought to give it to black firms.  But if you've got big-firm work, you can't give it to a small firm, just to give it to black lawyers.  You got to find and promote lawyers within major firms.  And so the program branched in two different directions.  And general counsels were, were comfortable with that.  And we grew the program too.  We had--over three hundred companies participating at one point.
Speaker 1: Now, talk about--can you put this in historical significance?  I mean, what, in terms of what minority law firms were getting or even minority lawyers, and I want to say this because as a young lawyer, when I was, came out of school, in a corporate department, the partner, you know, said that they would have screen clients because clients wouldn't want to deal with me.
Speaker 2: When did you come out of school?
Speaker 1: 1980.
Speaker 2: 1980?  Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Because there were not blacks in significant positions on the other side.  So I'd like you to just talk about the historical significance of this, you know, at the--what the state was at that point, you know, both blacks in corporate law firms and, you know, and black law firms?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was just growing, just, just starting when you, when you came out of school.  And over the next five or six years, it, it did not expand that tremendously.  Dennis started the--the Commission started in, the ABA [American Bar Association] Commission, that housed the program, started in '84 [1984].  The program started in '86 [1986].
Story_ID: 19474
Speaker 1: That organization started with a meeting we were having in Florida.
Speaker 2: That organization, just refer to it again as Minority--
Speaker 1: Minority Partners in Majority Firms.  That, that started as an outgrowth of the Minority Counsel Demonstration program, all of that did.
Speaker 2: But what, when you--just talk about sort of the status.  Why, what was happening with minority lawyers, I mean period.  I'm just trying to get the context to a time, you know, to a time that you emerged out as, you know, the top person at Chrysler [Corporation]?
Speaker 1: Oh, there were maybe two or three.  There were, there was no legal officer in America, no black legal officer in America as significant as, as I, with a role as significant as mine when I was the general counsel at Chrysler.  It was just too early.  It just hadn't happened.  Now, there are, there are quite a few.  But there were none at the, at that time.  That's why it was important that I participate, that I--and because I was a general counsel, I could explain to other general counsels how to get it done, okay; how to make it happen with your--within their shops and what the risks were, you know.  The risk wasn't bad lawyering.  It was political.  But it began to develop more and more and more over time.  And, and I, I was making forty speeches a year about--on this topic.  It was, it consumed a lot of my time.
Speaker 2: But, one, why were you so passionate about it, and two, what were you communicating in terms of what needed to be done, and three, how did you even put it in play?
Speaker 1: I was so passionate because I did not want to leave the profession until there was a successful law firm, black law firm in America.  I, I do believe that if, if we don't achieve economic success in this country, integration is not gonna work.  Integration only works when both parties have, have substance.  It doesn't work when one party doesn't have substance.  What was your second question?
Speaker 2: My second question was, and why did you think it was necessary, you know, to do that, and, and I think my third question was how did you go about doing it?
Speaker 1: It, it became clear to me that I had to both model the behavior and convince my peers that it was a reasonable thing to do.  I also became convinced that once it started, it would fuel itself; that if you could get a relationship started, it would make it on its own or it wouldn't, having nothing to do with race.  And I was convinced that the 'Old Boys' network was alive and well and needed to be, that that's the way lawyers were hired via the 'Old Boys' network.  We just had to create some new 'Old Boys' and 'Old Girls'.  And that's what we were doing.  We, we--and, and how did I go about it?  I had an elaborate, elaborate programs, ABA [American Bar Association]-sponsored programs.  We'd go off for three days, okay.  We'd go off Thursday, Friday and Saturday.  We'd have a program Thursday, a reception Thursday night, programming on Friday, programming on Saturday, lots of speeches that were totally irrelevant.  We built in soak time.  We built in plenty of time for the lawyers to get to know each other, to play golf, to play tennis and to drink.  And that's what it was all about, golf, tennis and drinking.  And by the time the weekend was over, when folks left on Sunday morning, on Sunday noon, they had played together.  They had drank together, they had eaten together, and yeah, they'd gone to some meetings.  And they had debated and talked about issues, but mainly, they had gotten to know each other.  They had established relationships that would continue after the meeting.  And so folks would call, and they'd get together, okay.  And that led to business because that's how business was, was done.  You got to remember, we live in the, one of the most segregated countries in the world, okay.  We don't eat together.  We don't worship together.  We don't belong to the same country clubs.  We don't, we don't do anything together except work together, and we're, we work together because we're required to.  If we weren't required to--and go to school together, if we didn't, if we, if we, if we weren't required to, we wouldn't.  So when do we have an opportunity to get to know each other?  What we did was create opportunities for folks to get to know each other.  And when they got to know each other, they fell in love, sometimes literally (laughs), which could get to be a problem, but most of the time professionally.  And, and, and those relationships lasted and some still lasts.  Some worked and some didn't work, okay.  But, but eventually the program got too big.  And you, you just can't--it's not informal when it's too big, you know, but, boy, we had some marvelous sessions, marvelous sessions, till eleven, twelve, one o'clock in the morning, you know.  We'd all get together and just laugh and talk and drink and play tennis and play golf, and lots of lunches and that's what it was all about.  We'd create the, the meeting time because there had to be reason to get together.  But we kept it to a minimum, and we kept the issues light, you know.
Story_ID: 19475
Speaker 1: Now, what did Chrysler [Corporation] represent as, you know, in terms of its legal department?  How much money was actually there?  I mean how much money did you contract out?
Speaker 2: A hundred million a year.  Lots of money.  Lots of money.
Speaker 1: And here is a black man in charge of a hundred million dollars a year in contracting out.  Did you get any resistance though from the, a majority law community to this?
Speaker 2: In Chrysler?
Speaker 1: Well, for people who already had existing relationships?
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.  Oh--I got resistance from the guys at Chrysler.  I mean one of the little things I found out, and I used to make speeches to tell people this, is that, I couldn't pick the lawyers.  I couldn't say, this piece of work is going to that firm.  I'm general counsel.  I'm all powerful.  I could not make that decision.
Speaker 1: And why was that?
Speaker 2: Because somebody in-house was responsible for that piece of legal work.  And if I had made the assignment of the lawyer, that lawyer would fail.  It would be tragic how badly that lawyer would fail.  But if I encouraged the guy responsible to pick that lawyer, that lawyer succeeds.  And this guy is not gonna let me pick his lawyers for him, okay.  If I tell him, "Hey, man, you know, see that.  Pick one that looks like that."  "Who?"  "I don't care who, as long as he looks like that.  Okay, I can do that for you, Roy."  But if I have a suggestion, it doesn't work.  It didn't work.  I had to learn that the hard way, okay.  But, so I had cajole.  I had to befriend. I couldn't--it wasn't a matter of pushed down.  I mean it wasn't a matter of power and authority.  It was my personality that helped me convince the guys in-house.  Hiring was a different story.  I do remember that I got four general--assistant general counsels in a room and said, "You all need people.  I only can hire two people, but I'm--which, whichever of the two of you come up with black candidates first, get to hire people."  Now, I, I could do that, okay.  And, in fact, I did that two or three times.  The first time I did it, the guy walked in the, in the door with a white candidate, and I hired him. Excuse me (coughs).
Speaker 1: Do you need any more tissue or anything?
Speaker 2: No no, I'm okay.  I hired him because he was just wonderful and, and Paul, who had brought him in said, "Roy, you know, his only deficiency, he's not black.  He's got everything else." (laughs) I said, "Okay, Paul, hire him."  And Paul did.  But he also found, you know, we, we made it work.  But it's, it's not a push down.  It's not something you can do--you have to convince people to join the team.  You can't threaten them or force them to do it.  It just doesn't work that way.

Story_ID: 19477
Speaker 1: When we last ended, you were talking about, you know, having gotten, you know--being head of Chrysler [Corporation]--.
Speaker 2: Legal department.
Speaker 1: Legal department, and what your whole, you know, what your intent was there.  And I wanted you to just sort of talk about--you were talking about really going around, you know, cause it was great excitement about it.  No, you were--.
Speaker 2: What happened was, I, when I was promoted to Vice President and General Counsel of Chrysler Motors, Lee [Iacocca] called me and congratulated me.  It was June 10, 1986, and he--.
Speaker 1: (Whispers) That's your wedding anniversary.
Speaker 2: That's my, that's the day I found my bride [Julia Thomas Richie].  Yes, we were married June 10, and he called me that in 1986 and told me I had been promoted to vice president by the board.  And I thanked him, and I sat back and reflected on what a tremendous accomplishment that was for me.  And I felt very good about that accomplishment.  What happened surprised me.  Within a week, I had received several hundred messages of congratulations from people all over Detroit and the country, but primarily from the Detroit [Michigan] area.  A young woman who was a lawyer working for the UAW [United Autobile Workers] came up to me in a grocery store and just put her arms around me and started crying and said, congratulations.  My home and my office looked like funeral parlors because there were so many flowers and plants.  One fellow who worked in the plant just walked in my office and said, "Mr. Richie, I don't want to bother you.  I just, I just wanted to say how wonderful it is to see you here," and he handed me a terrarium and just left, and wouldn't stay and talk.  He just left, and he had tears in his eyes.  What I, what I began to realize was that this wasn't my accomplishment.  It was one that I had to share, and it was one that I may not have been primarily responsible for, but it was a wonderful thing to happen to me, and I certainly appreciate it.  But I began to feel--I honestly felt that I, I wasn't there for me, that, well, as I said it to myself, God didn't put me there just to, just to get wealthy and to, and to make new law.  He put me there to do something different.  And so I began looking for opportunities to, to make a difference.  And I think I found some.
Speaker 1: And that's what, you know, when you were talking about the fact that you were trying to increase business for lawyers.
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: And that you had to learn that process, you know, that you couldn't just make the edict.
Speaker 2: I did, I did tell you that.  (laughs) Yes, I said, well, Dennis Archer who also will be here this evening was at the time a justice of the Supreme Court of Michigan, and he was working for the ABA [American Bar Association], working with the ABA, and had started a program for black lawyers to--a, a, it was the Minority Counsel Demonstration program.  And it was designed to demonstrate that minority lawyers could do corporate work in America.  And he asked me to join him, and I said, "Dennis, I, I'd be pleased to."  And we started working together with the top lawyer at Ford [Motor Company] and the top lawyer at GM [General Motors Corporation] to try to put together this program.  And I thought it was easy.  I'm general counsel so when I walked in and told my guys, "This is your new best friend, this is the lawyer you're going to work with," they politely looked at me and said, "No, no, we, we've decided not to."  And I explained to them that tens beat nines, and I'm a ten and you're at most a nine.  Therefore, you will do what I say do.  And they explained to me, "No, we won't."  And their enforcement mechanism, which was very effective, was simply to find any lawyer I forced on them incompetent.  And it was a, it was a very effective weapon, and it stopped me in my tracks.  And I had to go back and learn that I had to negotiate within the company, that I had to build a consensus for what I wanted to do.  And I set about building that consensus.  And I was able to build that consensus and put around me a bunch of guys who shared my views.
Speaker 1: Now, how long did that take you, to, to, you know, build team.  You're talking about, you know, still the mid--you know, 1986--I mean how long did it take you?  Did it take you three years, four years?  How long?
Speaker 2: It took me a good three years.  It took me a good three years.  I, I didn't want to bring in people who, who agreed with me.  I brought in a couple of lower level people to carry out the program, but I really wanted to convince my guys that I was right.  And that took, that took a little longer than it ordinarily would, but what happened was, once they became convinced, they took it on themselves.  And it was, it was--some of the transitions were wonderful.  I, I took my head of my products unit to one of the meetings, and he (laughs) made his first speech.  He stood up and said, (laughs), well, I'm happy to work with you people (laughs).  And, and everyone was tolerant in the room because, because (laughs) they, they had been through that before.  And he didn't want to be there.  He went there because I asked him to.  But after he had dinner with a couple of people, he found some folks that he wanted to work with, and he turned out to be a tremendous advocate for the program.  And he actually made it work within, within my shop.
Speaker 1: Now, how many lawyers were you supervising?  How large was the legal department--?
Speaker 2: I had about a hundred and thirty lawyers.
Speaker 1: That's what I thought you--and with that, weren't they divided, you said, I think in nine different--was it nine different?
Speaker 2: When I got there, they were divided in nine different sections.
Speaker 1: But you said that some of that made sense, and some of it didn't, and I'm wondering what--but we never got around to what you did to sort of change that or if you did change it.
Speaker 2: I did change it.  I consolidated several sections, and I changed the head of some sections so that it was litigation oriented or business oriented or corporate oriented.  And I gradually could--as people left or as I got the opportunity to evaluate them over time, I would move them into the right, right positions.  And so, yes, I did consolidate that.
Story_ID: 19478
Speaker 1: So can you talk about your tenure there [at Chrysler Corporation] and what things were significant and what, you know, happened?  I mean first of all, you had come, you had both the blessing of Lee Iacocca and Jerry--.
Speaker 2: [Gerald] Greenwald.
Speaker 1: Jerry Greenwald, and, and so that helped.  And so there was no question about your, you know, ability to--you know, I mean that you had not--there's no question because you had been the heir appointed or there.  So that wasn't the case, but still you had to sort of win your team over.  But what's interesting to me is that you had been, you know, you had had a very good experience at the FTC [Federal Trade Commission] managing people.  So this was like managing your own law firm.
Speaker 2: It was--that wasn't difficult for me.  I, for some reason, managing has never been the issue.  What was more difficult for me was managing in a corporate environment, and, and my peers, managing my peers was, was more difficult than managing my subordinates.  The people who worked for me tended to like me, they liked working for me.  We had a good time together.  But my peers were, were sometimes jealous.  They were my clients, and, so that, that I found much more difficult.
Speaker 1: So who were your peers?  Who were some of the people?
Speaker 2: Different vice presidents--.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --who, who wanted to--some of them were very friendly and were my mentors.  Some of them did not necessarily want me in the position and wanted me to fail.  And some of them needed to be--I mean some of them were doing things that were not in the corporate best interest.  And so I had to stop them from doing those things.  And that was very difficult.  And even outside, I mean I can remember one--one incident I had where I represented the company in connection with a plant we were, we were building.  And we were negotiating with the mayor of the city of Detroit [Michigan], who at the time was Coleman Young.  And I had negotiated a position for the company with which Coleman did not agree.  And when he came to sign the papers--he and Jerry [Gerald] Greenwald were gonna sign the papers to actually build this plant, one of his guys started challenging Jerry on the agreement that we had reached.  And I asked Jerry not to respond, and when he insisted, Coleman said, "Wait a minute," looked at me and said, "Wait a minute."  All, he just wants to hear what, what Jerry has to say.  "Let Jerry speak for himself."  And so I asked Jerry to leave the room.  I said, "Jerry, would you mind leaving the room?"  He said, "You, you want me to leave?"  I said, "Yes.  Wait, wait in your office.  I'll, I'll come back and get you."  And he got up and left the room.  And I looked at Coleman, and I said, "You know, I'm not gonna negotiate this with my client in the room.  If we're gonna negotiate it, then we'll do it now, and when we have an agreement, my client will come back and sign the papers.  But I'm not gonna negotiate with my client in the room."  And he absolutely exploded, absolutely exploded.  Because we're taping, I can't tell you exactly what he said, but it began with the letter M (laughs).  He just exploded on me, and he finally--when I abs--when I refused to let Jerry come back until we had reached an agreement, he finally settled down and agreed.  And Jerry came back, and we signed the papers and shook hands and left.  And one of the lawyers who represented me in Detroit at the time, a good friend, came to me a week later and told me I had to resolve my differences with Coleman Young, said I could not live in the city and have him saying the kind of things he, he was saying about me.  And so I went and arranged a meeting with him, and I sat down with him.  And it was just the two of us in the room.  And I said, "Coleman, listen, if you want black lawyers to represent corporate America, then you have to let us do our job and represent corporate America.  I can't represent you or help you when I'm supposed to be representing Jerry Greenwald or Lee Iacocca."  I said, "If you don't want that to happen, you can stop it from happening.  But if you want us to, to be there, then you've got to let us do our jobs."
Speaker 1: So he was--how did he take to that?
Speaker 2: Well, he did two things.  One, he agreed with me, and he, he resolved to allow me to do my job and represent him--represent the company against the city, and, two, he called me six weeks later and asked me to take six months and fix his law department.  And so I put a team together, and I spent six months and spent $140,000 dollars of Chrysler's money at--with their permission, to restock his law firm with computers, reorganize the personnel in his law firm, and actually get them new offices.  And I think we paid the rent for a couple of months until the city council approved.
Speaker 1: So did you become friends with Coleman after that or Coleman--Coleman was a, he was, you know, it's an interesting story you tell because he was--he probably wanted that, but at the same time, you know, to have a black man representing was, you know, he wasn't used to someone like you.  Let me put it that way, was--is that--?
Speaker 2: No, he was not used to someone like me.  When you say did we become friends, no.  And, and I always respected him and he always respected me, and we would laugh and talk and he would invite me to his parties.  And I went to a couple of them.  Coleman didn't like lawyers, and he never forgot I was a lawyer, and he simply didn't like and didn't trust lawyers.  But I was used to that, because Lee Iacocca doesn't like lawyers (laughs).  And we, we were pretty close, but he just, you know, he never forgot I was a lawyer because he had had a terrible experience with, with lawyers at Ford [Motor Company].  They had given him some very bad legal advice.
Story_ID: 19479
Speaker 1: You started in 1983, right?
Speaker 2: 1983, yes.
Speaker 1: And so by 1986, I mean you have this meteoric rise, really in three years, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yes (laughs).  And so--.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And there are a lot of people who, even black people who've been in queue longer, you know, who've been there, but okay, we, but we won't go there.  Okay, but my question--.
Speaker 2: Frank Fountain.
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: Frank Fountain.
Speaker 1: Frank Fountain is one of them.  I mean I'm just saying that, 'cause he had started in 1973.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So my question for you is, what state is the company [Chrysler Corporation] at that, you know, at the, at the time, and what are the issues facing it?  You know, because it wasn't until 1995 that there was the--what is it?
Speaker 2: [Kirk] Kerkorian.
Speaker 1: Kerkorian and [Lee] Iacocca--.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Take, you know, attempt a takeover.  So, I'm just wondering because--wait the van, the minivan, right, had--.
Speaker 2: It was 1984.
Speaker 1: 1984, so that, you know, had set--and the profits were going--.
Speaker 2: They were going right through the roof--.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at that, at that, at that point.
Story_ID: 19480
Speaker 1: What were the issues that you were dealing with, you know, cause the company's profits were going up.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And I'm just trying to sort of understand--you know, the Jeep had come out.
Speaker 2: Well, no.
Speaker 1: The, the--I'm sorry, not the Jeep.  I'm sorry, the minivan.
Speaker 2: The minivan.  The minivan had come out.  It had been out for a year, two years when I was promoted [in 1986].  And they, the corporate issues where we were selling some companies and buying some companies, and then we bought AMC [American Motors Corporation].  That was the first big thing that happened.  And that's what, that's what cause the problem between the general counsel for the holding company [Dick Goodyear] and me, the general counsel for the operating company.  Jerry [Gerald] Greenwald put me in charge of buying the company, of doing the due diligence and making sure that the two companies were compatible and integrating the companies.  And he thought that should have been his job, and so he left.  And, and--.
Speaker 1: And the key thing was that this was the person who had brought you in?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right?  Yes.
Speaker 2: This was the person who had brought me in.
Speaker 1: Brought you in.
Speaker 2: Yes, and we have not spoken since he left the company; have not said one word since he left the company.  He wasn't very happy.  I don't, I don't think that being black at Chrysler [Corporation] influenced me.  I mean I wasn't a black general counsel.  I was general counsel, and I mean I played the same corporate games as everyone else, and they, sometimes they were tough.  I remember we had, we had a big fight with NHTSA [National Highway Traffic Safety Administration], and we called a meeting.  And three of us, three vice presidents were going to meet with NHTSA, and they violated a condition of the meeting.  And we were sitting and planning for the meeting, and, and they called up and said that a person who was not scheduled to be at the meeting would be there.  And I, and my, my response over the phone was, "No, no.  We're gonna have the meeting that we planned to have.  We're not gonna have another meeting, and, and that's it."  And when I said that, they called back fifteen minutes later and cancelled the meeting.  And this was a very important meeting to Chrysler, and they cancelled it.  Well, when they cancelled the meeting (laughs), the vice president from the Washington [D.C.] office jumped up and ran into Lee Iacocca's office to tell him that they had cancelled the meeting.  And, and (laughs) it was--Lee called me in, and said, "Roy?"  I said (laughs), I started laughing, you know, because it was, it was Corporate Politics 101.  I mean, and I said, "Lee, we got this handled."  I said, "We're not gonna have the meeting that they want to have.  We're gonna have the meeting that we want to have.  And they're not gonna do anything until we have the meeting."  And so we had the meeting.  And it went fine.  I made a settlement with, with one of the agencies for--we, we were being sued by the agency for something like thirteen million dollars.  And I made a two million dollar settlement, which I thought was a wonderful settlement on Chrysler's behalf.  And I had authority to do it.  I mean it was fine.  And I went to tell Jerry about the settlement, and Jerry looked at me and said, "You know, five years ago when we didn't have a dime, they wouldn't have even tried to get this much money from us.  I'm not gonna pay it."  He says, "I'm not gonna pay a million dollars.  I will not pay any--I will not pay a million dollars."  I said, "But, Jerry, I've already agreed."  "Well, then unagree 'cause I'm not gonna pay it."  And he walked out.  (laughs) So I had to go back and renegotiate.  I had to call the guy and say, "I lost my authority.  I can't, I can't do it."  I mean I remember sitting in, in the room with, with, with, with Lee and looking at some papers, and Lee, and Lee asking, "Can I sign these?"  And we had negotiated everything, and we were ready to sign them, and when, when he said, "Can I sign these," I realized that something had happened, which is a story too long to tell, but it made those, those papers misleading.  And so I said, "No, Lee, you can't sign them."  And he, he pushed them at me, and he said, "All right, I'll sign them on Monday."  This was Friday.  And he got up and walked out, went back to his office.  And I--then I told the guys what was wrong with the papers and what had to be done.  And when I left the conference room to go back to my office, he called me, he said, "Roy, come here."  He said, "Don't ever let that happen to me again."  I said, "Okay, Lee."  And so there was some good news and some bad news, and, and what's interesting is that happened six months before I was promoted to vice president.  So, I mean--but it was a, it's--corporate America is a struggle.  You have to, you have to be ready.  You have to keep in mind that the only thing you have is your word.  And you have to use it judiciously and you cannot be sloppy with it.  You cannot be, you cannot be sloppy with your judgments because they will come back to haunt you, and there is someone willing to take advantage of every, every mistake you make. (laughs)

Speaker 1: Is it NHTSA [National Highway Traffic Safety Administration] deal?
Speaker 2: NHTSA.
Speaker 1: NHTSA deal.  What were the issues around that deal?  What were you--you told about the result, but what were the issues and, and were you successful?  You did go back and you successfully negotiated a settlement under a million?
Speaker 2: Yes, I went back and negotiated a settlement under a million.  We had--there was some advertising that, that Chrysler [Corporation] had done.  Chrysler had, had begun to use accident statistics as a basis for its advertising because we had very good accident statistics.  And I, I was personally against doing that because they change quite rapidly, and one accident can change the, the statistics dramatically.  Well, we had a campaign going.  It was a thirteen-week campaign and halfway through the campaign, the numbers changed.  We had a couple of accidents in Virginia and one person was killed, and boom, the numbers changed dramatically.  And it took us several weeks to get the, get the advertisements changed, pulled and changed.  And, and during that time, there was a, a technical violation occurred and NHTSA said, "You know, we're gonna, we're gonna prosecute this because we need some heads on the stick, and Chrysler, you're a good head.  So we're coming after you," and, and I was able to negotiate what I thought at the time was a good settlement.  It turned out that it was a terrible settlement, which I now know (laughs).  And I went back and negotiated a better settlement.
Speaker 1: So did it take you long to negotiate that, that other settlement?
Speaker 2: It took me just a day to negotiate that other settlement, I mean--.
Speaker 1: Under a million?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  NHTSA is a bureaucracy and all bureaucracies work the same way.  And I had to--I mean I've been had because, because people that I was negotiating with knew my bureaucracy better than I did.  And this time, and this time I was able to use it to my advantage.  Once the guy at NHTSA told his bosses that he had a settlement, the congratulated each other.  They felt very, very good about that.  And the settlement was more important than the amount of the settlement.  So when I went back and told him we don't have a settlement, he was then faced with the proposition of either going back and saying, "I'm sorry, I was wrong; we don't have a settlement or, I was right, we have a settlement.  It's not worth as much as I thought it was worth, but it is a settlement.  It's a scalp.  We can hang it on our wall, and we can take credit for it, okay."  And he was unwilling to go back and say, "I was wrong," because his bosses had moved on to something else.  And I knew that would probably be the case, and I learned that that would probably be the case because when I was selling companies at Chrysler, I would sell a company, and I would make a deal with a, with a, a guy from the, from the other side, a small company, okay.  And I'm dealing with the president of the company.  And I would negotiate with him, and he'd say, "We have a deal."  And I'd go tell my boss, we've got a deal.  I'd tell Jerry [Gerald] Greenwald, who was at the time, president of the company, "Jerry, we've got a deal."  He'd say, "Congratulations Roy, that's a fine result."  And then the guy would call me up and say, "We don't have a deal."  And I'd say, "That's outrageous.  That's unethical."  He says, "Yes, I'm very sorry, Roy, but we don't have a deal.  Go tell Greenwald we don't have a deal.  I'm still willing to negotiate, but we don't have a deal."  And I'd have to say to him, "What would it take to get a deal?" (laughs) And he knew he had me.  He knew he had me.  Well, you know, that happens to you a couple of times, and you start getting smart, okay.  And so I always kept something in my pocket.  Whenever I made a deal, I had something else in my pocket, okay, so that when he backed out of the deal, I had something else, or I wouldn't tell anybody that I had the deal.  I did something not to get caught in that situation again.

Speaker 1: Was there other things about running the legal department [at Chrysler Corporation]?  You're saying running of the legal department was not the, I mean was not the problem.
Speaker 2: My--.
Speaker 1: It was the politics of corporate America.
Speaker 2: Well, that, that was more difficult for me.  My management philosophy is simply to--I manage by agreement.  I don't ask you to do anything you don't agree to do, and everything I want you to do, I ask you to agree to do it.  If you don't agree, then I either do it myself, find someone else to do it, or continue to, to negotiate with you until we--we find something that you can agree to do.  And that's what, that's what you do.  Once you agree, I expect you to live up to your agreement.  It's very simple.  And if you don't live up to your agreement, then we, we have a performance issues, but it is clearly defined by your failure to keep your word.  And I always keep my word to you.  That is the simplest management philosophy I could ever think of, and it is one of the most effective.  It's the way I managed my kids.  It's the way I manage the people who work for me.  It's the way I manage my peers.  The only person I don't manage that way is my wife [Julia Thomas Richie] (laughs).
Speaker 1: I thought it worked all the way around.
Speaker 2: (Laughs).
Speaker 1: (Laughs) There're exceptions to every rule.
Speaker 2: (Laughs) Every rule (laughs).
Speaker 1: Now, you had--are there other stories of things that stick out in your mind, you know, that you would consider, let's say--I'd like to hear your success stories, I mean other things that happened, you know, during your tenure.  I mean you were the first, right, black?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, right.
Speaker 2: Until Frank [Fountain] was promoted I was, I was the first for several years.
Speaker 1: But all, but also even in terms of the whole United States and, you know, corporate legal departments, right?  You were vice--weren't you the first?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You weren't.  Were you--?
Speaker 2: Otis Smith was the first at GM [General Motors Corporation].
Speaker 1: Otis, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I was the second.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, okay.  So, but can you talk about some of your other successes?
Speaker 2: You mean at Chrysler?
Speaker 1: At Chrysler.
Speaker 2: Frankly, none come to mind.
Story_ID: 19483
Speaker 1: Well, let's talk about the product liability and the acquisition of, you know, of Jeep and how that, you know, you had started to start of mention that.
Speaker 2: Well, I, I--it was a two billion dollar responsibility, and it, it involved forty-five people, additional people that I had to manage.  And, and a, and a responsibility that, I mean had been--it was very tricky, very, very tricky.  And no one tripped to it.  When I was at the Federal Trade Commission [FTC], I started the lawsuit against American Motors Company [AMC] that resulted in the, in the disclosures that they have on Jeeps today, okay.  I started that lawsuit against American Motors and negotiated a settlement with them.  When I then--and I signed the settlement, working for the FTC.  When I then went to Chrysler [Corporation], and Chrysler acquired Jeep, and I ended up in charge of, of the Jeep responsibility, it was the agreement that I had signed at the FTC that many plaintiffs' lawyers were trying to enforce against Jeep.  And they regarded Jeep's noncompliance with that agreement, occasionally, as evidence of wrongdoing, that subjected Jeep to punishment.  They never tripped to the fact that I was defending the company, and I was the one that had signed--my name was right on the agreement that they were holding up in court and, and trying to enforce.
Speaker 1: So you said they never, they never--.
Speaker 2: They never discovered it.  No one ever discovered it.  No one ever discovered it.
Speaker 1: Were you ever worried that they would?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, because that's--.
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: They would say here they went and bought the--(laughs), the--.
Speaker 2: Oh, once, once, once it was discovered one time, it was over.  It was over, and I'm sure that I could have continued in my--.
Speaker 1: In the position.
Speaker 2: In my position--.
Speaker 1: It could have been a hot potato.
Speaker 2: It could have been a very hot potato.  It really could have.
Story_ID: 19484
Speaker 1: You had talked also about the fact that when you, I think were put in that position, was there just that time--there weren't that many black [automobile] dealers, right?  Or there were?
Speaker 2: There were not many black dealers.
Speaker 1: The dealers, okay.  And I think you talked about Jesse Jones.
Speaker 2: Jesse Jones was one of the few--.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and Jesse Jones had, probably had more to do with my promotion than I knew.  Jesse Jones met with [Lee] Iacocca and [Gerald] Greenwald on a ship in Italy one evening and started berating them about not having any black vice presidents.  And they took the position--Lee took the position at that, at that meeting I'm told, "That we'd love to make a black vice president, but we don't have anyone ready."  And Jesse called him a liar, and said, "Yes, you do have someone ready.  You got Roy Richie standing there ready."  And Lee looked at Jerry and Jerry looked at Lee, and six months later I was a vice president.  I told Jesse to his face he had nothing to do with my promotion.  And he smiled and walked away (laughs).  At that moment, I was very, very happy that I had come to the epiphany that I had and concluded that maybe I hadn't done all of this on own--(laughs) on my very own (laughs).
Speaker 1: So did, did the number increase during your time?
Speaker 2: Of black vice presidents?
Speaker 1: Dealers.
Speaker 2: Of dealers?
Speaker 1: Dealers.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, but it, they increased because of Tom [E. Thomas] Pappert.  I mean Tom Pappert was really committed to, to finding black dealers, and he had a guy inside, and what Chrysler [Corporation] did was different from GM [General Motors Corporation] and Ford [Motor Company].  Every dealership point that became available in the country was first offered to a black dealer.  And if it was rejected by all qualified black dealers, then it went to--it was offered to a white dealer.  But every point was offered to a black dealer first.  And that happened for several years, and it was a wonderful system.  It really was.  Now, Tom stole some points, okay, some really, really good points, he would steal and offer them to his, to, to his favorite white dealers.  And I once asked him about that.  I asked him why he did that, okay, because the conventional wisdom was that he just wanted to give the white boys the special deals.  And he said, "No, Roy, that's not it."  He said, "Look, in order for this program to survive, it has got to be commercially successful.  I have got to be able to demonstrate that the program I have of giving black dealers the, the points first, that over the period of time, the whole program is making money for the company.  One dealer can be losing money, two dealers can be losing money, but the whole program has to be making money for the company.  If I get a really hot point, I want to give it to--every now and then, I want to give it to a really hot dealer, a guy that's been making millions and millions of dollars for years and years and knows exactly what he's doing because I want him to come in and continue to makes millions and millions of dollars because he covers all of those dealers that are not making a lot of money."  Yeah, yeah, that's a deal where a black dealer could make some money, but he can't make money like a guy who's been doing it for thirty-five years and has a whole network set up.  And so you got to leave it to my judgment that I know what I'm doing, but I've got to be able to stick around and when, and when I go in and say I've offered a point to John Brown and John has accepted the point, okay, and they want to look at me and say, well, John Brown has got a point over here.  He's a black dealer.  He's got a point over here, and he's making a little money, but he's not, he's not really making a lot of money, okay.  Can't you do better for this point?  My answer is, look at the program.  Look at the whole program and see how it's doing, okay.  Don't look at the individual dealers.  You let me keep making the choices I'm making because I'm producing a successful program.  And that made perfect sense to me.
Speaker 1: So between, let's say the years--what was the growth of the black dealer program between like 1986 or '87 [1987]?
Speaker 2: 1987 it really was.
Speaker 1: '7 [1987].
Speaker 2: And 1993.  We quadrupled the number of black dealers that we had in that, in that period of time.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me what--do you know any of the stats today?  Are those dealers--?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I've been hearing--I talked to someone who's, and they said the Ford dealerships, every--they're losing them each year.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: At, at rapid numbers.
Speaker 2: They are.  They are.  Ford wasn't--I don't think Ford was as careful as Chrysler in terms--we never put anyone in a deal that hadn't been to school, that hadn't--and Ford did take more risks.  They had more dealers.  They had--their, their numbers required them to have more dealers.  And, and so it was more difficult for them to get, for them to get dealers.  We had a, a steady program.  We started from a smaller base, I mean, that's what Ford would tell you (laughs).  Chrysler had nothing when it started, and Ford's right about that, but it was, we quadrupled the number of dealers we had.  And, and in the law department, I mean we--I had hundreds of black lawyers working for me around the country.  One of the, one of the nicest things that happened to me was I went to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] because my daughter [Darcy Richie] got in some trouble with her with parking tickets.  She had an excessive number of parking tickets, and we had to go to court.  And so I called a law firm here to find me a lawyer in Philadelphia, and they found me one, and he called me, and he represented--and he met with my daughter, and I flew in.  And we went to court, and he negotiated a settlement, which was wonderful for my daughter.  And when we came out, I asked him, I said, "What do I owe you?"  And he said, "Mr. Richie, don't embarrass me.  I would never charge you."  I said, "Why not?  I'm a client."  He says "Yes, but you're also the guy who got my law firm started back in the '80s [1980s] when you gave us that work from Chrysler."  And I didn't know I had given him work for Chrysler, from Chrysler.  It was part of the program [Minority Counsel Demonstration Program] that I started, actually with Lewis and Munday [Corporation].
Story_ID: 19485
Speaker 1: You contracted out, Chrysler [Corporation] contracted out, was it a hundred million?
Speaker 2: A hundred million, yes, a year.
Speaker 1: Year, I mean that's a huge amount.
Speaker 2: It is.
Speaker 1: So when you started, how many minority law firms--how many were getting any of that business?
Speaker 2: When I, when I started, let me see now.  Oh, I remember, none. (laughs)
Speaker 1: (Laughs) Okay, and so, so--but you know you--this, now, it's an interesting thing, you said, you know, I was sort of--you didn't say I was colorblind, but I was, you know, I was a lawyer, you know, I was a lawyer for Chrysler first, but at the same time, you were determined to try to make some inroads and to diversify.
Speaker 2: Oh, because diversity was clearly in the corporate interests, clearly in the corporate interests, and it was, it was supported by the corporation.  So that wasn't--it wasn't a stretch, okay.  How I did it may have been a little bit of a stretch.
Speaker 1: So, so talk--you talked about, you know, you did talk some about the, you know, outsource, you know, the--.
Speaker 2: Outsourcing.
Speaker 1: Out, outsourcing, but, now, you didn't--and you talked about the obstacles, but I'd like you to talk about how you built that and also how you hired in.  I m mean I don't know.  What were your numbers in terms of lawyers in house for, for minorities?
Speaker 2: I told my guys, at one point, I just said, "Look, I've got five guys working for me, and each of them were authorized to hire either one or two lawyers."  They couldn't--I, I hadn't released those authorizations because--and I explained to them, said, "Look, fellows, the, I got--there are six of us in the room.  We're entitled to hire, according to our numbers, we can hire nine people.  But I can't hire but three."  I said, "Right now, you know, they've, they've shut me down.  I can't hire but three people."  I said, "So, I'm a tell you what.  We, we need to, we need some diversity here.  The first three black lawyers through the door, I'll hire.  In other words, you want somebody, make them black."  And that worked.
Speaker 1: But what--.
Speaker 2: But let, let me tell you what I did with, with Lewis and Munday because it, it wasn't just about outsourcing legal work.  It was about building an institution.  I'm probably not the most popular guy in town because I didn't spread my legal work around.  There are many, many black law firms here--not many, many, but a few black law firms here that never got any work from Chrysler because I concentrated my work at Lewis and Munday [Corporation].  I gave them, I developed a warranty program where we stopped settling warranty cases in house.  We stopped negotiating warranty cases in house.  I gave them all to Lewis and Munday.  I gave them, I made them--first, I gave them half the country, and then a year later, I gave them the whole country, okay.  And they had to go out and hired lawyers.  And that's the program that the guy in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] was in.  They hired lawyers all over the country, and managed those lawyers, and helped with those lawsuits, and we either settled those cases or litigated those cases, depending on what we did.  But, but Lewis and Munday got a, got an administrative fee for managing those cases.  They handled the ones here in Michigan, and they managed the ones that were across the country.
Speaker 1: Now, that's interesting.  Why--was that a trend?  I mean how, why did you decide?  Was it just it was too mundane or too much a waste, waste of time?  You know, how companies make decisions about what they outsource and what hey keep in, you know, inside.  So, I'm just wondering why you, why you chose that, you know, to give out?  And the how much money did that represent?
Speaker 2: It represented over a million dollars a year.  And the reason I, I chose to outsource that was because it was an, it was a neat package that I could outsource, and I could still manage it fairly well from, from, from in house.  And I couldn't afford to bulk up.  I tried that.  I bulked up, okay.  I hired lawyers in house to do a lot of the work that I could done outside, and the first time there was a downturn, they came to me and say we need a ten--and said, we need a 10 percent personnel cut.  Well, that's easy to say, but when you have to walk up to someone who's been working for you for five years, who has a family, who has a wife at home and, and a couple of kids and say, we're gonna lay you off, that's very difficult.  That throws a pall over the whole office.  That's just not the way to run a railroad.  So I stopped doing it.  I started outsourcing my work, and kept a much lower in-house base, and 25 percent of my lawyers were always on contract. 25 percent of my lawyers, my in-house lawyers--lawyers were always on contract because it's much easier.  You--they don't develop the same set of expectations, and, you know.  I'm now working with a couple of lawyers that I hired on contract, and they were on contract for four or five years, and then they came in house, once they had been around for so long, they, you know, they have the same problems as in house people.
Story_ID: 19486
Speaker 1: That million dollars was significant with Lewis and Munday [Corporation], right?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was.
Speaker 1: Okay, and can you--did you--why did, why did you choose them?  Was it because they were in Detroit [Michigan]?  Because you had, you know, you had, had--you knew them, you know, and knew of their work, and you were--?
Speaker 2: Because I met the partners there, and I trusted their work.  I had worked with Reuben [Munday].  He represented in the city in this, in the, in the Jefferson [Michigan] plant that I, that I built.  We had become very good friends after he threw a book at me and told me to go read it.  It was 'The Spook Who Sat By the Door' (laughs), yes, he did.  I've hated him ever since (laughs).  And (laughs), and he threw the Bakke case ['University of California v. Bakke'] at me too and said, "Here you need to read this." (laughs) And, and all I could do--I felt so simple-minded, I just sat there saying, I've read that case.  I, I know that case (laughs).  I couldn't think of anything.  I was so angry.  I, I had met David.  I have a tremendous respect for David Lewis.  He is a very, very competent, very good lawyer.  And so, I, I appreciated their legal skills.  They were growing at the time.  I remember when I negotiated this with Reuben, I said, "Reuben, I'll give you this work [with Chrysler Corporation], but you have to do three things for me, okay.  First, the first has to make you a member of the board.  Secondly, you've got to get your own personal secretary because when I want to reach you, I want to reach you, and I want somebody to know where you are, and I do not want to call and have the receptionist tell me 'Mr. Munday's not in, and I don't know where he is'.  So you have to get a secretary, and when you price it, when you tell me how much it's gonna cost me, you add this to it.  You have to be on the board; you have to get a secretary, and you have to pay all of your lawyers and your personnel, you have to pay their healthcare costs."  I said, "Because I can't invest in a firm that's not building toward an institution.  So you tell me what you need, okay," and he added computers to that, and I bought computers for them.  It was cheaper than, than hiring people because Jerry [Gerald] Greenwald was right.  Every person that comes on represents a nine million dollar expense to Chrysler, if they're under thirty-two years old.
Story_ID: 19487
Speaker 1: Who else were you talking to around the country who were in like positions with you, you know, with you and trying to do some more things?  I mean were--because you're talking at the early stages of, you know, a lot of these things happening--.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --because even, and I don't even know if the numbers are any better today, you know, blacks in corporate law firms, you know--anyway.  That's another story, (chuckle), but I'm just saying that, who, who were you counting on?  We know that you were talking and working with Dennis Archer.  And I think I had asked you about the MCCA, Minority [Corporate Council Association]--.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right, and you--.
Speaker 2: I was not--the, they weren't in existence--.
Speaker 1: They weren't in existence then--.
Speaker 2: --at the time.
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying, you were the precursor to that.
Speaker 2: Yes, exactly, yes.  We were at Longboat Key [Florida] when that organization started.  We were down there for a meeting.  But I, I mean the truth of the matter is I wasn't talk--speaking with anyone.  I mean this was really, I was really out there on my own in terms of that kind of thinking.  I was institution building.  You know, I was talking to Reuben [Munday] who helped me a lot in terms of clarifying my thinking about that, but it, it really was just trying to think up ways to make sure that the institutions got built, you know, trying to bulk the law firm up.  And I guess they had to hire ten or fifteen people to accommodate that work.  And they kept it for years.
Speaker 1: And they kept it for the whole time that you were there?
Speaker 2: Oh, and several years after I left.
Speaker 1: And after that, okay, okay.  And you left in 19--?
Speaker 2: 1997.
Speaker 1: 1997, so you left two years after the merger, right?  Didn't the merge--?
Speaker 2: No, I left a year before the merger.
Speaker 1: You left a year before?
Speaker 2: The merger was announced January--.

Speaker 1: Do you have any other like favorite [Lee] Iacocca stories that you haven't told?
Speaker 2: I, I really don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not, not that I can think of.
Speaker 1: Okay, so let's, let's talk--.
Speaker 2: Well, yes, I, I don't know if I've told it, about odometers?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Did I tell, I didn't tell odometers?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Oh, I have to tell odometers.
Speaker 1: You didn't tell odometers.
Speaker 2: The year is 1987.  And I get a call at twenty minutes to five in the morning that two of our guys have been stopped outside of St. Louis for driving a car with the odometer disconnected.  I hired a lawyer in St. Louis [Missouri], told him to go into court and get the guys; make sure they didn't go to jail.  And eight months later, I had to walk into Lee Iacocca's office and tell him that we were being indicted for odometer fraud in St. Louis.  And the government had conducted a grand jury investigation and they indicted us for odometer fraud on Wednesday, June 27, 1987.  I walked into Lee's office on Tuesday, and I told he and Jerry [Gerald] Greenwald together that we were gonna be indicted for odometer fraud the next day.  I also told them that we were gonna suffer a $2.7 million fine from OSHA [Occupational Safety and Health Administration] on Monday.  Things were going well at that point in our (laughs) lives.  It was one hell of a week.  I walked in on Tuesday, and I told them that I--they asked me what we could do about it.  And they asked me whether we were guilty, and I told them what, what I knew at the time and what my investigation had revealed.  Thursday, I took a company plane and I flew to Newark [New Jersey], and Newark, it was our Newark plant that was subject to the OSHA fine, okay.  And I met with OSHA officials, and they told me that on Monday, they'd doing--to, to investigate the plant.  And they based their recommendation on what they found then.  I called my secretary, and I told her to get on a plane and come to Newark because I wanted her to coordinate the weekend.  I hired, I brought in over a hundred guys to clean up the Newark plant.  And I set up a schedule for cleaning it up, and I said, "I'll be back Sunday night to take a look at it because Monday morning, OSHA will be here."  I did that all day, and then at eight o'clock Thursday night, I flew out of Newark back to Detroit [Michigan].  I got to Detroit, and I went to a nine o'clock meeting with Iacocca, nine o'clock Monday morning--Friday morning meeting with Iacocca.  He wanted to know about the indictment and what I had found out.  We sat in Iacocca's conference room.  And when you're reporting--it's an oblong table.  He sits on one side, just inside the door, and you sit on the other side.  And every--all the other vice presidents sit around the table.  There must have been fifteen vice presidents in the room at the time, and I described the indictment, told him what they had found.  There were four or five instances that they had found of really egregious things, like we had unhooked the odometer and gone deer hunting, okay, and then rehooked it and sold the car as new.  We had unhooked the odometer and run off the road and tumbled two cars, okay, took them to the repair area, fixed them up, hooked the odometer and sound them as new.  I mean there were some things that we had done that we probably shouldn't have done.  And I described those to Lee and said, "We've got a problem." The way those meetings go is Lee, after he hears the, the report, he says, "Roy, before you make a recommendation, I'd like to hear from some other folks."  And he starts around the room and asks everybody in the room, what do you think?  And I remember he went around the room, okay.  And everybody--Jerry Greenwald had a view.  He said, "I remember what it's like to be dead right, okay."  And he got that from selling warrants in 1983 when we paid back the billion six [$1.6 billion] loan guarantee to the government in 1983.  Because we paid it back so early, we had issued the government warrants, okay, to buy Chrysler stock, and we thought we were entitled to those warrants back because we had paid the loan back before those warrants became effective.  And so we asked for those warrants back, and we were right legally.  We had a legal opinion, we can go get our warrants.  The government went public with the fact, went public with the fact that we had, after begging them to lend us a million--a billion six and having gotten an act of [U.S.] Congress to, to do that, now, we were trying to renege on the cost of that billion six.  And they took us public and beat the mess out of us publicly, okay.  And Jerry said, "I was right, but I was dead, I was dead right.  And I don't want to be dead right again."  Ben Bidwell said we should do nothing.  Ben Bidwell was our chief marketer.  He said, "Let's find out what the dealers think.  I'm scheduled to talk to all the dealers tomorrow.  We'll find out what they think, but this is not something we should decide in a hurry."  Everybody had a view.  My view was, "Lee, I'll take care of the lawsuit.  You take care of your customers."  And Lee sat back and won my heart that day.  He sat back after listening to everyone.  We had been meeting for a couple of hours, and he said, he said, "You know, we're in a funny business here."  He said, "I could make more money taking the, the investment we have in Chrysler and put, putting it in a mutual fund because the return is greater in a mutual fund than it is off this business."  He said, "We do this for one reason.  We do it for our customers."  He said, "And right now, we have a problem with our customers.  Our customers--," and, and he used an analogy that I will never forget as long as I live.  He said, "It's like you walk into Bloomingdale's, and you buy a pair of underwear.  And when you get home, the sales person at Bloomingdale's calls you and says, 'Mr. Richie, the pair of underwear you bought today, it's perfectly clean, but it had been used before.'  How would you feel?"  He says, "Our customers don't trust, and we've got to get our trust back."  He says, "I want you--," he said, "Sunday afternoon, we're gonna meet here." He said, "And you have a plan for me to get our customers back.  I want to know what we can do for them."  We met on Sunday.  Ben spent the day Saturday calling all the dealers.  Sunday we met with our advertising people, our marketing people and the legal people, and we devised a plan to go public on Wednesday.  The other thing that happened at the Friday meeting is, we had hired Princeton Research to find out how serious our problem was.  Let me see if I've got these numbers right.  72 percent of the American people knew about our odometer problem, 72 percent of the adult population of America knew about our odometer problem.  58 percent, of that 72 percent, had concluded that Chrysler had done something wrong.  And 32 percent of that seventy--of that 72 percent had concluded that they would never buy another Chrysler, okay.  This was on Friday.  Sunday we met.  Monday and Tuesday I spent, first, going to Newark [New Jersey] again with the company plane to make sure that, to follow that inspection and make sure that we got a--I knew, by this time, I knew, okay, if I went back with Jerry with a settlement under a million, he'd be happy (laughs).  And so I wasn't gonna make that mistake again (laughs).  And I told the guy, "You want me to agree to a million seven, I will, I'll agree, but I can tell you what's gonna happen when I get to Chrysler (laughs)."  And so, we agreed on nine hundred ninety thousand dollars, okay.  Then I went to Saint--I flew to St. Louis [Missouri] because I knew that the U.S. Attorney in St. Louis would regard anything we did as jury tampering or witness tampering because we were talking about free inspections.  We're talking about free oil replacements.  I mean we were, you know, free warranty for five years.  I mean we were gonna do a lot for the people in this--that had been, that had bought these cars.  I got permission to do what we needed to.  Wednesday, at 1:00 o'clock in the afternoon, there was a press conference.  The mea--the 'mea culpa' press conference where Lee Iacocca said, "Not telling our--unhooking odometers was dumb, not telling our customers about it was stupid.  It'll never happen again.  The buck stops here.  And I'm telling you, it's my fault mea culpa, it'll never happen again."  Ben Bidwell pulled our advertising in our top seventy-seven markets for Thursday, for the next day, and replaced it with that ad, with a big poster board, okay, with check marks on it.  And Lee Iacocca standing there, mea culpa, okay.  And we had a press conference that a hundred reporters in it.  The next morning, when you picked up your paper, in twenty--in the top twenty-seven markets in America, the first thing you saw was Lee Iacocca on the front page standing there with this poster board and his hand over his heart saying, mea culpa.  When you opened up the paper, there was a full, two-page ad, okay, with Iacocca standing there with the poster board saying, okay.  Friday, we took, took another survey.  And 69 percent of the American people thought Chrysler had done a wonderful job to solve its problem.  It's now the subject of a Harvard [University] Business School study because it is, it is the greatest turnaround in American history.  It's bigger than Tylenol.  It was faster and bigger than Tylenol.
Speaker 1: You mean the whole odometer.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: On the--right, not just his takeover of Chrysler, but the--.
Speaker 2: No, no, no, this wasn't the-- this had nothing to do with the takeover.
Speaker 1: Tell me, why was the company--what was the problem?  You didn't, you told the--but what was the problem with the odometers that the--?
Speaker 2: We were unhooking them.
Speaker 1: But why were you unhooking them?  You didn't explain--I know--why were you hooking--what was the defective about the odometers that you were unhooking them?
Speaker 2: Nothing was defective.
Speaker 1: So why were you unhooking them?
Speaker 2: It was an employee benefit program.  The guys in St. Louis didn't have to buy two cars.  They had to buy a car for their wife, and they didn't have to buy a car for themselves, because they had new cars to drive every night.  They just unhooked the odometers and drove a new car home every day.  They had, they kept another new car over the weekend.  They had a car to use every day.  If they went deer hunting, they took their car.  If they went on a--on vacation, they took their car.  And they just unhooked the odometer so that when they returned their car, it could be sold as new.

Speaker 1: Lee Iacocca's whole story with Chrysler [Corporation] is amazing because he had been the number two person at Ford [Motor Company], was it--?
Speaker 2: He--.
Speaker 1: --and then he had, he had gotten passed over, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And so he came in, and you know--.
Speaker 2: He took a dollar a year and options.
Speaker 1: And then, and then their--.
Speaker 2: And turned Chrysler around.
Speaker 1: But now, people said that once you had, you know, that he had done that original, you know, sort of turn around, and you paid the, the [government] loan back so quickly, that there were, over the next years, let's say, you know, between--that there was a series of some mistakes or Chrysler got lazy, you know or--that or careless or, I mean that you had, you know, you had the success with the minivan.  And you owned that market for a while.
Speaker 2: We owned that market for eight years.  We owned the Jeep market.  We were the only car--in 1989, Chrysler had minivans and it had Jeeps.
Story_ID: 19490
Speaker 1: I want you to talk about first when Lee Iacocca decided he was going to retire or it was decided he was going to retire and that whole process, you know, within the Chrysler Corporation?
Speaker 2: The, the, the question of who would be Lee's successor was, as you, as you might imagine, a huge question.  And everybody was involved in the process at the top of the company.  I mean the board was involved and, and Lee and the speculation was rampant as to who, who it would be.  The inside contender was Bob [Robert] Lutz.  I think I know what happened.  Lee wanted--Lee didn't trust anyone within the company to take his place.  And one of the finance guys whose name I can't remember now, was a friend of Bob [Robert] Eaton's.  They were good friends, and he suggested to Lee that Lee take a look at, at Bob, that he had the experience.  He had run GM [General Motors Corporation] of, of Europe and said, "You ought to interview him and take a look at him."  Lee did, liked what he saw and recommended Bob to the board.  And they hired him.  There were a lot of politics going back and forth around whether Bob Lutz could get the support at the board level that he needed, and obviously, he couldn't, and that's why Eaton was selected.  He was brought in from outside.  At the time, I thought it was a mistake.  I didn't think he had the experience to run the company.  It turned out that he made a very wise decision.  He left the daily operations to Bob Lutz.  And the two of them did a pretty good job of running the company.
Speaker 1: Now, that was in nineteen--give me the year, nineteen--?
Speaker 2: 1970--1993.
Speaker 1: '93 [1993], okay.  And so from '93 [1993] to ninety--?
Speaker 2: '7 [1997].
Speaker 1: '7 [1997], that period of time, can you say what--how, what was the status of Chrysler at that time, you know, just in the whole sort of, you know, economy?
Speaker 2: It was, it was recovering.  We had, we had sold our furniture.  We were trying--selling furniture--I meant we had sold the airplane company and the bank and we were trying to sell the technology company to get money to invest in the car business.  We had to refresh our products.  It was a pretty good run because Lutz was a product genius, and he developed a team that put some pretty good products on the road.  And so we had a, we had some pretty good years during that, during that time period.
Speaker 1: Okay, now was Lee Iacocca, he--did he still remain on the board at that time or he had literally retired?
Speaker 2: No, he left.
Speaker 1: Okay, he left.  Now, what do you think happened, of his interest in, you know, this whole thing of taking, as you, you know, you--.
Speaker 2: Taking it private?
Speaker 1: Taking it private.
Speaker 2: I think he found [Kirk] Kerkorian and, and persuaded him to invest in the company, and they approached Eaton.  And I think the conver--I wasn't at the conversation in New York, but I'm, I'm reliably informed that Lee made, made that suggestion, made that offer, and, and Bob chose to view it as a takeover attempt.  And that's what he called it, and I think that hurt Lee very deeply.  But be that as it may, it was regarded generally by the public and, and more broadly inside the company as a, as a takeover attempt by Lee.
Speaker 1: Now, how did your role play in that?  You know--.
Speaker 2: Not, not very much.
Story_ID: 19491
Speaker 1: So even with the takeover, the inside counsel--I mean your role as the legal department, did it change or, you know, were you preparing documents or the, no?
Speaker 2: No.  I, I really was--my, my role in terms of the day-to-day legal activities of the company [Chrysler Corporation] didn't change.  We still--they kept suing us, and we kept defending those lawsuits.  And the dealers kept doing things that required legal intervention or legal assistance, and the environment stayed what it was.  The plants still had problems, and so those problems remained, and I continued to manage those issues.
Speaker 1: Now, with--did you find that the role of the department changed any between, you know--now, Jerry [Gerald] Greenwald, did he, where was he?
Speaker 2: He left early.
Speaker 1: He left early, before--okay.  Around the time of [Lee] Iacocca or before?
Speaker 2: He left before Lee did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, why do you think, why, why did Jerry--?
Speaker 2: Jerry left, I think because he decided he was--.
Speaker 1: He saw the writing on the wall?
Speaker 2: I think he had a conversation with Lee, and Lee told him.
Story_ID: 19492
Speaker 1: Was there any change between Lee [Iacocca] being there and Bob [Robert] Eaton being there in terms of the functioning of your department [legal department at Chrysler Corporation]?  Did it change much or it was sort of transparent?
Speaker 2: Bob was more hands on than Lee.  And he, he--his experience with the legal department was colored by his experience at GM [General Motors Corporation] with its legal department.  I wasn't thrilled with Bob as a, as a manager, and ultimately, I left because I decided, and I said to him, "You need a general counsel that you can trust.  You need to go find one (laughs), you know, and have one because you don't trust my judgment."  I mean I--he wasn't listening to me, and clients ought to listen to their lawyers or they ought to go get lawyers they can listen to.  So I wanted to give Bob that opportunity.
Speaker 1: And how--when, so what do you mean?  Was he looking over everything or you're saying his experience at GM, you know, that he had gotten some bad advice, that--?
Speaker 2: No, no, he had a good experience at GM.  He was very close to their associate general counsel, the guy who ultimately took over as general counsel at GM.  And he wanted to have that same relationship at Chrysler, and he was in a different role, and I don't think he appreciated the difference in his role.  What I meant by listening to me, is he had to testify in certain cases.  And I remember one case in North Carolina where he had to testify and he just refused to prepare for the case.  He just wouldn't, wouldn't listen to the guys, wouldn't--you know, I talked to him personally about, "Bob, you got to get ready."  He didn't.  His testimony went horribly, and we lost the case.  And it was the first case I had lost; lost sixty-two million dollars.  It was reversed on appeal, and we settled for a lower amount, but I decided that I didn't want to be a part of that anymore.  It wasn't fun so I decided not to do it any more.
Speaker 1: And your credibility is on stake in things like that.
Speaker 2: My credibility was on, was, was on point there, and I just didn't like that.
Speaker 1: Now, what did you find?  When you were back at, you know, the time when you were running the department, what things did you learn, you know, in that process?  You were very articulate about what you learned, you know, with the FTC [Federal Trade Commission] and doing that, you know.  And, and that you also learned that you were a good manager of people at that time.  I'm wondering what, you know, how, when you look back through sort of your career path, what that, you know, what the experience represented in your, you know, your career trends, progression?
Speaker 2: I don't think I applied most of the lessons that I learned while I was at Chrysler.  I had an--I had an opportunity to apply those lessons to the practice of law.  I don't know that I learned very much in the last three or four years that I was at, at Chrysler.  My view is that the job of a manager is to work himself out of a job.  You hire very competent people, and you give them the responsibility they need.  You give them the authority they need to carry out the responsibilities that you've assigned to them.  And I did that.  I hired good people or promoted good people, and gave them the responsibile--the authority to do their jobs.  And they did a good job at it.  They know when they needed to check with me, but generally speaking, they were pretty good at doing their jobs.  And so the last couple of years, they did their jobs, and I didn't have very much to do.  And I just decided that I had had enough of that.
Story_ID: 19493
Speaker 1: Your role with the [automobile] dealers, can you describe what that role was and also--?
Speaker 2: We [the legal department of Chrysler Corporation] provided legal counsel to the dealers--I, I mean to the company in their dealings with the dealers.  There were--we, we had to do most of that in house because that's not something that outside law firms do a lot of.  And we had experts in dealer law and in, in working the relationships with the dealers.  And so the sales department had their lawyers, and I managed those lawyers, but they pretty much knew what they were doing.
Speaker 1: And in that, was there--that whole thing of dealer law was new to you, is what I'm saying, right?  No?
Speaker 2: In 1986, yes.
Speaker 1: In 1986, okay.
Speaker 2: Well, in 1983, it was, but then I took over managing the dealers, the dealer-lawyers in 1984, and I managed them until I left.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they were the same lawyers generally speaking.  I mean they were there when I got there, and they were there when I left.  I mean they, so they, they knew what they were doing.
Speaker 1: So, as you looked forward to--were you thinking you would retire or were you thinking that you wanted to sort of go on?
Speaker 2: I was thinking that I would retire.  I really was.  I, I was fooled by that.  Retirement is a, is a pretty lousy concept (laughs), and it--I'm now comfortable with the notion that I will never retire, I mean in the sense that I will, that I will never spend most of my time relaxing.  That's just not who I am, and I don't want to do that.  I will always be busy doing something.
Story_ID: 19494
Speaker 1: Can we talk about South Africa?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, we can.  Remember, I was the chief domestic lawyer [at Chrysler Corporation].  And Bill O'Brien was the chief international lawyer.  So that the guys who legally represented South Africa reported to him.  There came a time in early 1980--'94 [1994] when [Nelson] Mandela was going to be released from jail, when he--when apartheid was on everybody's lips, and changes were happening in, in South Africa.  And we decided that we wanted to go into South Africa and sell cars.  And I remember I became involved because the effect of apartheid--if you violated the apartheid laws, one of the effects was you couldn't sell cars to municipalities and, and, and state and federal governments.  And that was a huge issue for us.  So I became involved that way, and, and at some point, they asked me to review a press release.  I remember I was on a plane going to Buffalo, New York, and I was reviewing this press release where we were announcing that we had established eight dealerships in South Africa.  And I took a look at the press release, and I, and I called from the plane and said, "Hold the press release.  Don't issue it; don't have the press conference."  And they said, "Why?"  And I said, "You haven't appointed any black dealers."  And I said, well--and they said, "Well, there are no black dealers in South Africa.  How could we appoint any?" (laughs) I said, "Well, we, we got to do better than this."  And so I was able to stop the press conference from going forward and stop the press release.  And then I said, "Look, let me find out what's going on here."  And so I became involved in South Africa, and I started representing the company in South Africa.  And I went to South Africa several times, and it was a fascinating experience.  It really was.  I remember the first time I went to South Africa.  I was absolutely incredible.  I stayed in Sandton, which is just outside of Johannesburg.  I, I arrived about midnight.  And I went to the hotel in Sandton, and I checked in, and I went up to my room.  At the time--I, I haven't told you this story.  At the time, I was on the National Judicial College board, and they gave us workout outfits to use, to have actually.  And I had one of them with me.  So I got up the next morning at a quarter to six, and I went down--I went up to the workout room, to the health club to work out.  And I walked in the health club, and there was no one there at the time, just me.  But there were four or five people working there, and they were all Aryans, tall, blonde.  I think they had blue eyes.  They were in long, white pants and white t-shirts and white sneakers.  I mean it looked perfect.  And I, I remember walking in, and they all looked at me and said nothing.  And they had walking machines, some facing the window and some facing in toward the facility.  And so I got, I chose one that faced in.  And I got on it, turned it on, and started walking.  And I walked for an hour.  That was my principal workout.  Every morning, I'd walk for one hour on the, on the walking machine.  And they would come by, and they'd stare at me.  And they wouldn't say anything, and then customers started coming in, and they would come by and just look up at me and everybody was white.  Everybody was white.  I was the only black person in there, okay.  And they would look at me and then walk away.  And as they would come in, guys would walk over to them and ask if they could help, and they would explain the machines to them and help them get started with their workout.  No one said a word to me.  No one spoke to me.  No one came close to me.  And I remember thinking at the time, folks--because they had released Mandela.  He wasn't president, but they had released him, and they were planning elections.  And I said, "Folks, get used to it.  This is the new reality, okay."  And I finished my workout, and I, I took the towel that I had taken at the beginning, and I toweled off, and I went outside.  And there was a young woman sitting there at the desk when I got outside, and she looked up at me, and then she looked at her--she averted her eyes.  And I, I remember throwing the towel at, in the, in the bin and saying, "Folks, get used to it, I'll be back tomorrow morning, and we can do this dance all over again."  And I went downstairs, and I, I was on the fourteenth floor, I think.  And I got to the floor, and I, I had a suite.  And the entrance, when you opened the door, there were mirrors all along the wall.  And it was, it curved around into the living room, and then the bedroom was behind the living room.  And I walked by the wall, and I noticed my reflection, and I just started laughing.  I started laughing because I was wearing a t-shirt, a blue t-shirt and gray trunks, and the blue t-shirt I had gotten from the National Judicial College, and it said, "Take the law into your own hands, hug a judge."  And I started laughing, and it occurred to me that maybe they had not spoken to me--maybe it wasn't the fact that I was black.  Maybe it was the fact that they thought I was a judge, and universally, no one speaks to judges (laughs).  The next morning, I put on a plain blue t-shirt, and I went up there, and I started my workout, and everybody who came in waved to me.  The guys came over and, and started the machine for me.  They treated me completely differently.
Speaker 1: That's amazing.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, completely differently because I wasn't--it, it, I didn't look like a judge (laughs).
Speaker 1: That's an adorable story.
Speaker 2: Oh, it's just wonderful.  And I was, I was convinced, oh, I, I knew, "This is the new South Africa, and get ready for it, folks.  I'm here to stay.  You're not going to intimidate me with your racial prejudice (laughs), 'cause I know how you are."
Story_ID: 19495
Speaker 1: I actually found South Africa--I have not been able to explain to myself the difference between the prejudice we, we suffer here in this country and, and apartheid.  It just, it's different.
Speaker 2: And different in what way?
Speaker 1: It's, apartheid is much more respectful.  It--I, I--it's just--it was, the difference was, was amazing.  The South Africans were, were amazing.  I mean I, I, I had another one of, one of my other experiences was meeting [Nelson] Mandela there.  I mean the first time I met Mandela, I've met him a few times, but the first time I met him was in ANC [African National Congress] headquarters.  And my lawyer who was his fifth cousin, took me to meet him.  And we went in the back of ANC headquarters, and we walked up five flights of stairs, and went into, went into his reception area.  And Thabo Mbeki was walking through, and I was introduced to Thabo, and then the, the three of us walked into Mandela's office, and we sat there and talked for forty-five minutes.
Speaker 2: So what was that experience like?
Speaker 1: Talking to Mandela for forty-five minutes?  You really want to know?  It changed my view of, of life.  I'm not a, I'm not a very strong religious man, but reincarnation had never occurred to me as a viable option, religious option.  But after meeting Mandela, I'm now willing to consider that there a limited number of souls in the world, and those souls inhabit bodies for as long as the--that interaction lasts, and then they go back into the pool of souls.  And, and they are recycled.  I don't know exactly how it happens, but I believe that the same soul may have inhabited Jesus, [Mahatma] Gandhi, Mandela, and several other people.  I won't, I mean I could, I could give you the path of this soul, but I have, I've never met a man like that in my life.  He was--he just, he just lived on a plane that was different, higher, better, more thoughtful than the plane I lived on.  I mean he, he--it's--he was incredible, just to listen to him, it--was to know that he was thinking in a different, in a different way.  I attended his inauguration.  I went over there to attend his inauguration.  It was an amazing experience.  I, I think I attended the most important meeting I've ever, I've ever attended there.  There were seven South African billionaires, Mandela, Ron Brown and me at a meeting.  It was just amazing.  I heard them offer Mandela, give Mandela one hundred gold mines, and when he asked, "Why?"  They said, "Because when the Afrikaners took over from the British in 1949, the British had quite an investment in South Africa, and the Afrikaans--and they wanted to make sure that the Afrikaners shared that investment.  So they gave him a hundred gold mines.  And now that blacks were taking over, you get a hundred gold mines too.
Speaker 2: Who gave that to him?
Speaker 1: The Afrikaners.
Story_ID: 19496
Speaker 1: Were you successful in getting the black [automobile] dealers there [to South Africa], 'cause--?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was that process?
Speaker 2: Well, when I say, successful, we appointed black dealers, but it was several years before we could actually implement the plan because we had to build an infrastructure.  We wanted to give [Nelson] Mandela a Jeep before he was named president.  We couldn't because we had no infrastructure in the--in the country.  We had no way of servicing them.  We had none--not sufficient gas stations.  I mean it was a different, it was, it was setting up a whole network.  And we, we eventually did.  I mean we're--but yes, I, I--when you say, was I successful?  The company [Chrysler Corporation] was successful.
Speaker 1: In making that happen.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so there're black dealers in South Africa now?  They're--?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yes, okay, yes.
Speaker 2: They were appointed.  I don't know what the state of our--.
Speaker 1: Right, right, no, I understand, I understand.
Speaker 2: --South African business is.

Speaker 1: We were talking about retirement, and, you know, and that facing.  So you, you left in 1997.  Now, what was your thinking that you wanted to do, you know, with your life, at, you know, at that point--?
Speaker 2: I didn't have a clue.  I didn't plan for retirement very well.  I played golf every day for six months, and then I bought a business.  And it failed in about a year and a half (laughs).
Speaker 1: What was the business?
Speaker 2: It was preparing heavy truck engines for Detroit Diesel [Corporation].  The bottom dropped out of their business, and therefore, it dropped out of mine.  They were my principal customer and when they lost their franchise, we lost our business.  It was not a very good adventure for me, and it was a terribly expensive adventure.  But it took me some time to adjust to retirement.  I mean we built a house in Florida, and I started spending more time there.  But it took several years to adjust to it, and to figure out that retirement is garbage.  I mean it's not a viable concept, and people shouldn't, shouldn't think in terms of retirement.  They, they may need to leave the workforce.  They may need to leave the job that they have, but they need to find some other way of contributing, and I think, making a difference.
Speaker 1: Now, you have joined, you know, recently, the law firm of--?
Speaker 2: Lewis and Munday [Corporation].
Speaker 1: Lewis and Munday.  And tell us how that, you know, even came, you know, came about, and your sort of progression into that because you, you know, you've said that I didn't enjoy retirement, but you didn't know what you wanted to do at the beginning, right?  So you're back practicing.
Speaker 2: Well, what happened was, I'm a good friend of, of Reuben Munday.  He's one of my best friends.  And they had a palace coup.  Several lawyers left the firm in early '94 [1994], in early 2004.  They had a real falling out with these lawyers, and they left.  And they took some business with them.  When they did, it devastated the people who remained at the firm.  They had just signed up for larger offices, more expensive offices.  They had increased their overhead to accommodate all of the lawyers they had, and now half the lawyers walked out.  And the rumors in town--I was in Florida at the time.  When I got back to, to Michigan, the rumors were that they were going out of business, that they would not survive.  And A--it was my view that the walk-out had helped them rather than hurt them, and B--the rumors were patently untrue.  And so I asked Reuben if I could--if it would be helpful if I took an office there.  And he--they both, he and David [Lewis] leaped at the opportunity.  And they wanted, wanted to announce it that, and we waited a, you know, an appropriate period of time until I actually had an office there.  And they gave me an office, and the thought was that I would just work out of there, and just let--lend my name to the enterprise.  I said at the time, you guys have to have a corporate practice if you're gonna be successful.  And some corporate work started coming in the door, and they didn't have any one who could, who could do it.  And I volunteered to A--bring in a corporate lawyer, and B--help him do the work to make sure that it got done well.  And it's turned into a full-time job (laughs).  And recently, they indicated that they might even pay me for it.

Speaker 1: This had been your dream of building, you know, a black law firm up--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and so you have--you're back sort of in the saddle, so to speak.
Speaker 2: Well, I'm trying to do the same I was trying to do at Chrysler [Corporation] from the other side.
Speaker 1: Now, tell me this, would you do law all over again?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh, absolutely.  You know, I've insisted that my children [Brooke and Darcy Richie] become lawyers.  They don't have to practice.  In fact, I don't think they intend to--my daughter certainly doesn't intend to practice, and my son isn't practicing.  But I want them to have the legal education, and would I--would I, would I choose the life that I've lived if I had to do it all over again?  Yes.  I'd just make more money doing it, but I would--I'm only kidding about that (laughs).  I, I've made--.
Speaker 1: Done pretty okay (laughs).
Speaker 2: I've done all right (laughs).
Speaker 1: Now, what do you--what would you say, though, makes a good lawyer, you know, what makes a good corporate lawyer?
Speaker 2: I don't know that I can answer that question.  I think what makes a good corporate lawyer is what makes a good person.  I mean you've got to be--first, first, you're not gonna be successful as a lawyer or as anything else if you don't have your ethics together.  You've got to cut your corners very sharply.  You've got to be mindful of, of your relationships with people.  You've got to value your reputation, and you have to act like the word you say means something to everybody you say them to.  And that's, that relates to being a person, not just being a lawyer.  Lawyers need that in abundance, but everyone, everyone needs that.  So the first thing you have to do is you have to build an ethical person, if you're gonna make a good lawyer.  You've got to be a responsible person because you have people's lives in your hands.  I just represented a, an Arabic fellow in, in a--selling his business.  And I represented him simply because he asked me to do it.  I--it's not the kind of work I do, and, in fact, I gave it to one of the guys in the office to, to review because I had no clue what I was, what I was doing.  But he didn't have a lawyer.  He didn't have anyone he could trust.  And he had to have someone, you know.  And he trusted me.  And that was the only thing that, that we had going was he trusted me, and I was in a position to do him a favor.  And I pretty much did it as a--I charged him a little bit, but it was pretty much a favor.  But, so you, so you have to be responsible.  You have to take responsibility for, for what you're involved in.  And then I think you're on your way to being a good lawyer.
Speaker 1: But, I guess what I'm asking is, why was it a natural fit for you?  You know, why do you think--you said, I would do this, you know, again.  This was the best thing for me.  I've encouraged my kids to do it.  Why the law?  Why that?  What does the law--what has the law done for you?
Speaker 2: It made me a rich man (laughs).
Speaker 1: No, I know that this--.
Speaker 2: But, it--you get excited to get up in the morning, you know, to sort of tackle--that's what I'm wondering.  What is it that has such appeal and that you think, why other people should, you know, enter into it?
Speaker 1: I don't know that other people should.
Speaker 2: But even your children.
Speaker 1: I want them to have the education.  I'm not sure that I want them to practice.  I do want my daughter to practice.  I will admit that.  Brooke is incred--Brooke is brilliant.  Brooke is absolutely brilliant.  Darcy is brilliant too, but she's, she's a teacher.  And she's just a--she's a wonderful teacher.  Her, her students love her.  Her, her, her parents love, I mean the parents of her students.  I mean she really does it well, and she's got a sense of humor that would, that is just a knock out.  But Brooke is incredible.  Brooke, Brooke is a person--you're a lawyer, so you will, you will appreciate this.  Brooke bought a couch, and something was wrong with the couch and she called the store and spoke to the salesman and told the salesman to come get the couch.  And--to come get the couch because there was something wrong with it.  And the salesman said, "That ain't the deal."  And Brooke says, "What do you mean?"  And he says, "Well, if you had read the papers that I gave you, you would see that we're only responsible for thirty days."  And Brooke said, "I'm a lawyer.  Of course, I read everything you gave me, and it doesn't say that." (laughs) And, and I said, "Brooke, you didn't read every piece."  She said, "Of course, I did, daddy.  That's what lawyers do." (laughs) Now, I don't think, I don't think you've ever read everything (laughs) in, in, in one of these sales contracts.  I know I never have (laughs), but, and, and I've seen a couple of other occasions where she, she reads everything and knows everything about the contracts that she, that she deals with.  I mean that's just--I, I think she's gonna be--I think she's gonna make a marvelous contribution. (laughs) I really do.  So I want her to practice, but (pauses)-- Why?  I'm a verbal person.  I love--I like talking.  I like thinking on my feet.  I like problem solving.  I like managing situations.  I like figuring things out.  I can tolerate the uncertainty of result that lawyers have to tolerate.  I can, I can leap off into a situation not knowing where it's gonna end up and I'm okay with that.

Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: I don't care.  I want to make a difference while I'm here.  I, I--.
Speaker 1: What do you think--what do you want people to say about Leroy Richie?
Speaker 2: I don't care. (laughs) I'm being very honest with you.  I don't, I don't really--.
Speaker 1: Care.
Speaker 2: --care.  Julia [Thomas Richie] cares deeply.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, can you just say something about why you and Julia have had such a successful marriage.  You've been partners in the truest sense of the word.
Speaker 2: I got lucky.  Julia and Julia's mother and father split up.  And well, my mother [Mattie Allen Richie] and father [Leroy Richie, Sr.] split up too.  But on--it had a tremendous impact on Julia.  She decided she was not going to lose her marriage.  She just wasn't going to do it.  She was going to have a successful marriage.  And it has benefited me tremendously.  I mean I have, I have participated in it, but I'll, I'll tell one quick story.  Early in our marriage--we're both fighters.  And we used to argue a great deal.  We, we had to stop arguing because our kids [Brooke and Darcy Richie] would always ask us whether we were gonna get divorced.  So we, we just changed our style because of the children.  But the first eight years we were married, we didn't have kids.  And we would, I mean, knock-down, dirty arguments.  Not, not cursing and not disrespectful, but I mean we, we, we didn't speak for a day because we were arguing over whether the Nigerians or the Igbos had the--had right on their side in the, in their civil war.  You know, I'm relying on 'Time' magazine.  She's relying on 'Newsweek', and we are going at each other.  And we agreed at one point that we would not go to bed angry because it was having serious consequences in our relationship.  And then we violated that the very next day because we were angry with each other.  And Julia came up to me at one point--we had, we had just had an argument.  We had walked away from each other.  And she came, she came over to me, and she said, "I'm sorry."  And I said, "For what?"  And she said, "Because I was wrong, and I want to apologize."  And she came over, and we hugged.  And I said, Julia, "I accept your apology.  Thank you."  She said, "Okay."  And we went on, and I was happy and she was happy.  The next time we argued, I mean we--and, and it got dirty, I mean, and we left angry, okay.  We walked away from each other angry.  And she came over to me, and she said, "I'm sorry."  I said, "For what?"  She said, "I apologize because I was wrong, and I really sincerely want to apologize."  And so we hugged and we walked away, and I (laughs) thinking now, you know.  The next time we argued, you know, and we walked away angry, I'm looking over my shoulder, and sure enough, here she comes, "I'm sorry."
Story_ID: 19500
Speaker 1: She [wife, Julia Thomas Richie], I was looking over my shoulder, and she came and apologized again.  And it took a couple of times, but I began to get the message.  So that the next time we argued and walked away angry, before she had an opportunity to apologize, I did (laughs).  And, and it, it taught me.  It taught me that she was simply not willing to, to give it up.  We, we have--I mean we've been together thirty-five years, and we have never discussed divorce.  I mean we've, we--it's never, it's never, we never even thought about it.  And we've had--we used to have, I mean really big fights.  Once the kids [Brooke and Darcy Richie] were, were born and became of some age, you know, where they could understand what was going on, we had to stop because it intimidated them.  And we weren't willing to raise kids who were intimidated so we just, we stopped arguing in front of them.  And we just changed our style.  And, you know, after thirty-five years, the issues are pretty much resolved (laughs).  But, and the, I mean I remember sitting out, going to a party and coming home at eleven o'clock at night and having an argument with Julia in the, on the way home.  And sitting in the car until 3:30 in the morning continuing the argument, you know.  I mean it was incredible.  What's the secret?  I respect her, I trust her, she's my best friend, you know.  I don't want to do anything to violate her trust and violate the relationship, and I don't believe she would do anything to violate my trust, you know.  And that's been a fairly successful formula for us.
Story_ID: 19501
Speaker 1: Do the two of you talk about what plans you have--you know, for the future, what you want to see for each other--,
Speaker 2: What do you mean?
Speaker 1: --or for your families?  Plans for the future?
Speaker 2: You mean--?
Speaker 1: Plans, I mean just the things that you would like to do or see done?  Do you talk?  I mean she's [wife, Julia Thomas Richie] very involved with her YES Foundation--,
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, you have your interests, but is there any sort of thoughts--you know, or do you have things that you want to still do that you haven't done?
Speaker 2: Play a lot of golf (laughs).  I want to play, I want to play more golf.  I want to--I've never had five-year plans.  I've never had long-term plans.  I've pretty much made it up as it goes along.  I'm now--I, I walked in, I'm involved with this law firm [Lewis and Munday] now because I walked in and Reuben [Munday] and said--I said, "Reuben, would it be helpful if I joined the firm?"  He said, "It would be tremendously helpful.  Thank you, thank you, thank you."  And I did, and so now I want to make this successful.  I'll do it as long as it's fun.  When this stops being fun, I'll go do something else.  I'm on several boards because it's fun, you know.  And, and so I, I'm not--no, I don't have long-term plans.  We want the YES Foundation to be successful.  And we're working hard to make it successful, Julia is.  And I'm trying to help her fund it, you know.
Story_ID: 19502
Speaker 1: When you look at the black community, what hopes and concerns do you have for that community?
Speaker 2: That it will--my hope is that it will reacquire its middle class.  I, I think, I think that education is the key.  We have a unique opportunity in this country, at this point in history.  We have created the only mechanism the world has ever known for changing social class.  If you go to Europe.  If you got India, if you go to China, if you go almost anywhere in the world, people who are born in the upper ranks of--of that society stay there and people who are born in the lower ranks of that society stay there.  I mean what comes to mind immediately is in India, you know, the untouchables.  If you're born an untouchable, you just have to be reincarnated as something else because you're gonna be an untouchable all of your life.  That's the way it is pretty much around the world.  In this country, we get to, we get to change our social class.  And the way you do that is through education.  It's a marvelous, marvelous social mechanism.  And I want to see it be available to more--I don't mind different economic classes.  I don't mind the, the natural consequences of free enterprises, that there are different social economic classes.  And that doesn't trouble me.  I don't want them to be so black and white, and I think education is, is the key.  Am I troubled by racial prejudice in this country?  Yes.  Would I be personally happier if black people were on top and white folks were on the bottom?  No.  I mean I don't like having first and second-class citizens.  I don't care who's first and who's second.  I don't like that social model.  I am, I am personally committed to doing what I can to make it a better place to live by making sure that folks--by giving folks the opportunity to be educated.  And, I mean, I, I want blacks to be educated because it's better for the society.  And this is the best society the world has ever known.  We have come closer to dealing with an issue--no, no society has dealt with racial differences.  No human society has dealt with racial differences.  And we've come closer than anybody else has.  And, yeah, there are problems, and they're gonna, they're gonna continue until we find a way to educate everybody.
Speaker 1: Concerns, you--that's your hope.  What about concerns?
Speaker 2: I take the long view.  I take the, a, a really philosophical view that if you compare the world today with the world fifty years ago, we're better off, and fifty years from now, we'll be better off because, because of technology.  Because of, because of changes that occur in the way we live and our expectations, people are getting generally healthier and we're exercising more control over, over life and death.  So, so I don't have any real concerns.  I have momentary concerns.  I wish, you know, I wish I could stop smoking, but (laughs) I don't have any, any, any major concerns.  And I don't believe in controlling life from the grave.  I want to live as long as I can and be as healthy as I can, and once it's over, it's over.  And I'm gone (laughs), and I'm, and I'm comfortable with that.
