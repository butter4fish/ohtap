Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers project.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Sir, could you please state your full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: My name is Ernest Lee Lassiter.  E-R-N-E-S-T, L-E-E, L-A-S-S-I-T-E-R.
Speaker 1: Now, you generally go by the name of E. Lee Lassiter.
Speaker 2: That's how I've referred to myself since college days.
Speaker 1: Okay. Is there a story behind the emphasis?
Speaker 2: There is.  In the south, they have a pattern of calling you by your first name and your middle name, you know.  Patty Mae, Johnny Lee, and growing up, they called me Ernest Lee but they southernized it so it came out Erst Lee (ph.) and its really to me as a kid kind of something I disliked when you called from a distance Erst Lee (ph.). So when I went off to college I decided to get rid of the Ernest and I did, and so it's been E. Lee Lassiter since then.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And sir, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I was born July 11, 1936 in Carpenter, North Carolina which is a rural--you're stretching it to call a hamlet, near Raleigh, between Raleigh and Durnham, almost midpoint between Raleigh, Durnham, Chapel Hill, Apex, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And sir what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm a retired newspaper man.  People like to say journalist but I prefer newspaperman and I'm retired from a second career as a college professor.  I taught English, and I taught journalism for thirteen years.
Speaker 1: Okay, and when you taught at Coppin State--
Speaker 2: --Coppin State University.  It is now.  It was Coppin State College in 1986 when I started teaching there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now can you give us today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is July 16, 2010.
Speaker 1: Okay. And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're in a suburb of Baltimore City [Maryland].  It's called Woodmore, and it's in the western part of the city.  The city is surrounded by a county, Baltimore County.  So the county is actually West, South, North and East, because it circles the city, but I live in Baltimore County in the western part of the county.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth there are five lightweight 'People' magazine-ish type questions that management compels me to ask and they only require a short answer.  The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite is food is hot dogs and beans.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's the second hot dogs I've heard this week.
Speaker 2: (Laughter)
Speaker 1: I'd never heard it before.
Speaker 2: (Laughter)
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: I have a favorite combination of colors, black and yellow.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: The fall.  I prefer the fall of the year.  It's something nostalgic about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Home.  North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last one is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  Nothing comes to mind that I use to convey any special message or feeling.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 37404
Speaker 1: Well, I'm going to ask about your family history?--
Speaker 2: --(clearing throat).
Speaker 1: --I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, but we'll start with your mother's side first so we don't get them confused.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My mother's name is Margie Ree Upchurch Lassiter, and the Ree is unusual spelling, R-E-E, and I suspect that was meant to be Marjorie, but in those days, we did it our way and it came Margie Ree.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And her maiden name, Upchurch.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in Chatham County, North Carolina, and I can't remember the year of her birth.  I know it, but I can't, I don't--
Speaker 1: Can you?  Is there a rough guess?
Speaker 2: I have it written down over there, but I don't--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I don't remember.  I don't have it in my memory.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: She died in 1976.  She was sixty years old.
Speaker 1: In 1916 then, I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, 1916.  Okay.  Now, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace that side first, and--
Speaker 2: On--I knew my grandfather, her father.  His name was Claude, C-L-A-U-D-E, L, for Last, L-A-S-T, Upchurch.  And he was a farmer, and--but he owned his own stock and tools.  So he was a tenant farmer, but not an out-and-out sharecropper.  In North Carolina at the time you could be a farmer, a tenant farmer, and but you--the arrangements were that you as a tenant got two-thirds and the landowner got a third.  He was that kind of a sharecropper tenant as opposed to being a sharecropper who cropped on halves where the landowner got half, and, but in order to be a tenant farmer and give up just a third you had to own your own mule and your own stock and your own tools and that kinda of thing, and that's what he did.  He lived in Chatham County in an area where major staple was cotton, corn and some tobacco.  He raised a great deal of cotton and some tobacco, not a lot.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tobacco would be more of a cash crop.  Well cotton too I imagine.
Speaker 2: Cotton was--in that county, the very next county, Waken County, it reversed itself such that tobacco was the major cash crop for most farmers and they would raise some cotton or no cotton, corn for the stock, and some sale.  But for him, cotton was the main crop and some years he would raise tobacco.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 37405
Speaker 1: Now on your mother's [Margie Ree Upchurch Lassiter] side of the family, is there a, any tradition that goes all the way back to slavery?  Do you have any stories about that?
Speaker 2: I have no stories that connect them to slavery itself.  I remember her, my mother's mother's father, her maiden name, my grandmother was a Baker [Bethenia Baker].  And I can remember my great-grandparents.  I remember when he died and his funeral and that kind of thing, but I don't go back to slavery.  I never heard them talk about any slave tradition or anybody who was actually in slavery on (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: It's something they didn't mention at all?
Speaker 2: --None, that I recall.  My parents didn't, and I never heard my grandparents talk about anything that they remembered from slavery times.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, the tradition is that the family was always in North Carolina?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They were as far as I can go back on my maternal side, they were in North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And very--pretty much in the area of Chatham County, Sanford, North Carolina and surrounding areas.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what about your grandmother?  Did you know her too?
Speaker 2: Yes, I knew my mother's mother, Bethenia, B-E-T-H-E-N-I-A, Upchurch, married to Claude [Upchurch; Lassiter's maternal grandfather].  They had thirteen children.  My mother was one of the thirteen.  Where she placed, I'm not sure.  But I knew my grandmother and the Baker--she was a Baker and I knew her father.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She lived to be 101 [years old] so she was still alive when I became an adult.
Speaker 1: Okay, when did she pass away?
Speaker 2: I can't remember the year specifically although I have it written down here somewhere, but it was maybe fifteen years ago.
Speaker 1: Just fifteen years ago?
Speaker 2: It's fairly recent.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so 1995 or so?
Speaker 2: Something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was living in this house.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Well she would have born in 1896, I guess?
Speaker 2: Something like that.
Speaker 1: --or '94 [1894], yeah.
Speaker 2: It's either '96 [1896] or '97 [1897], something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 37406
Speaker 1: All right.  Well what did your mother [Margie Ree Upchurch Lassiter] say about growing up?  Did she have any stories about growing up?
Speaker 2: She talked about it, and she described it, it sounded like a hard life but a good family life.  She talks about her father [Claude Upchurch] and his parenting approach.  We used to sit around as children, my siblings and she would tell tales about his handling of the family, how he set the rules and how he set the pace and he made the decisions.  He was apparently very stern but they loved him because he was a comedian to a degree.  Part of his way of handling life was to put some humor in it.  So he kept them entertained.  He kept them happy and in spite of hard times and that kind of thing.  So the stories that she tells mostly relate to something that he did to a child or required of a child, or denied a child that in retrospect when she would tell it she found it amusing and loving and she appreciated the experience.  What I remember about him that he passed that same demeanor relationship to his grandkids, my siblings and myself.  So he loved to let his beard grow out and he loved to press his face with a three-day beard against a child and then he would laugh when we would react because he knew we wanted the hug, and we hated the feel and we would tolerate it and we would kind of inch up to him until we were really ready to feel the pain but we wouldn't give up that hug that's how we felt about him and he got a big kick out of punishing us in that way, knowing that we loved it.
Speaker 1: (Laughter)
Speaker 2: And that's one of my biggest memories about him.  Another is his pride and his courage.  He would walk around barefoot.  He was a farmer and lived on the land so he didn't always have on shoes, but you would think he was dressed going to a Boule or something the way he carried himself and the way he sat.  And he would cross his legs when he talked to you.  He always sat like he had a million dollars.  (Laughter)  And acted like he had a million dollars, but he didn't look the part.  But that always impressed me as a child.  I imitated that to a degree, and I think it rubbed off on all of us that here our grandfather is dignified and we didn't connect it.  We didn't make the contrast of him being poor.  We just appreciated the fact that he thinks he's somebody, therefore we think he's somebody.  He acts like he's somebody and so we kind of copied that.  And it made an impression I now know, you know, I wouldn't describe it as that as a child, but looking back, I know that it influenced my feel for him and my feel for who I was.  I felt important because he felt important.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 37407
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Margie Ree Upchurch Lassiter] have a chance to finish school in North Carolina?
Speaker 2: No.  My mother went only as far as the fourth grade, but she could read and she could write and just how she acquired her additional learning, I don't know, but I eventually attended the same elementary school that she attended at the time that she was in Apex, North Carolina which is near where she was born and grew up.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I--I know that she either went to the fourth or sixth grade, I can't remember right this minute whether it was my father [Narvie Hester Lassiter] who went to the sixth, and she went the fourth, or whether it was reversed, one or the other.  For the two of them that was the degree to which they got formal education.
Speaker 1: And did she talk about why she only went that far?
Speaker 2: It was the matter of the fact that her father [Claude Upchurch] was a farmer and the pattern was that you kept your children out to do the work, at the will of the need for the work or at the will of the landowner.  If he said keep the children home and get the crop in, using the kind of terms I've heard, then that's what happened.  And I think to a degree they as kids would lose interests because they couldn't excel.  They couldn't finish it.  They couldn't go regularly.  Going to school didn't seem to be her priority.  But somewhere along the line an appreciation of the importance did become a priority with my mother because she and my father acted it out later in how they made sacrifices for their kids to go to school.  And it was kind of around their idea, that they would sometimes talk to us about schooling.  I couldn't get it.  I couldn't go, and look at the differences it has made in my life because I couldn't.  Therefore, I'm going to see that you do have an opportunity and this kind of thing.  And somewhere along the lines she must have tried to learn reading and writing on her own because she could write and she could read and she could comprehend very well.  So where she learned it, how she learned it, I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 37408
Speaker 1: Now, can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My father's was Narvie Hester Lassiter.  N-A-R-V-I-E, Hester, H-E-S-T-E-R, Lassiter, L-A-S-S-I-T-E-R.
Speaker 1: Now is there is a story behind the name, Narvie?
Speaker 2: None that I can, have ever been able to get him or anyone else to piece together.  There's nobody else in the family named that.  Nobody else prior to him was named that.  I've run across the name in life.  I knew, I met a lady in Baltimore [Maryland] named Narvie, spelled it the same and one other instance, I've heard of somebody named.  That's the only time I've ever heard the name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And none of his kids did he name--
Speaker 1: (Laughter)
Speaker 2: --Narvie.  (Laughter).  He let it end with him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What's about Hester?  Is that someone's last name in the family, or something?
Speaker 2: None that--and I have looked at some of the chronology of others and there doesn't seem to be another Hester in my father's family and it hasn't been repeated either.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born in Chatham County, North Carolina in 1909.  January 21, 1909.
Speaker 1: Okay.  1909.  Now what can you tell us about your father's side of the family?  How far back can you trace that side?
Speaker 2: On my father's father's side, not very far.  My grandfather's name, my father's father was Clarence L. Lassiter.  The "L" in one reference I've seen didn't stand for anything.  In another, I've read in another account, it stood for Lonnie, L-O-N-N-I-E.  So which is accurate, I don't know.  But his name was C.L. Lassiter.  He was a minister.  Reverend C.L. Lassiter.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And in searching some of my siblings have tried to discover his background, and we cannot determine his parents, his mother, his father at all.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--
Speaker 1: Now, are there any traditions on your father's side that go all the way back to the slave experience or the, any--
Speaker 2: The only reference I have is that he is not a descendant of slaves.  That he came to North Carolina on a merchant ship as a freedman.  Now, his father came over a merchant ship as a freedman, free man and was subsequently, one account I read, subsequently made a slave but in recounting in the family, we choose not to believe that account.  (Laughter)  We choose to believe the account that he was never a slave, that he came over on a merchant, sea (unclear).
Speaker 1: Now, would this be your great-great grandfather?
Speaker 2: My grandfather's father.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, so is there a tradition about where he came from?  If he was--
Speaker 2: --No.
Speaker 1: --a seaman.
Speaker 2: Where he was coming from, I've never heard or read in an account.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what about your grandmother on your father's [Narvie Hester Lassiter] side?  Do you know very much about her people?
Speaker 2: Yes.  She was a Hackney, H-A-C-K-N-E-Y.
Speaker 1: What was her first name?
Speaker 2: Her first name is Daisy, D-A-I-S-Y, middle name Jane.  She was Daisy Jane Hackney Lassister.  Apparently she met my grandfather [Clarence L. Lassiter] in Chatham County [North Carolina] and, but her father, there are recorded--I can't, I cannot run down their chronology of her parents and their parents, but it has been looked up,--
Speaker 1: Has been done, okay.
Speaker 2: --and it is recorded.  I have a book over there that the Hackneys in North Carolina.  It's a whole chapter in that book, and so her ancestry can be traced back to her father's father.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Names, names and dates of birth, all of that is a matter of record.
Story_ID: 37409
Speaker 1: Now what did your father [Narvie Hester Lassiter] say about growing up [in Chatham County, North Carolina]?  Was he born on a farm too?  Was it?
Speaker 2: His father, my grandfather, Clarence [Lassiter], was a farmer and a produce salesperson so that he raised tobacco.  He raised corn and he farmed but his major income was to take his produce, load it on a wagon, take it into town and sell it from the wagon, later a truck, or take it to a series of stores that he would place his goods, sell his goods to.  So he was part farmer and part tobacco farmer and part produce farmer.  And he never owned his land.  He rented it.  So he could be called a tenant farmer but he was also independent.  Somebody else owned the land, but he only had to pay the rent.  He didn't have to run his farm according to their dictates.  He ran it--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the way he wanted to.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.  So he was similar to your mother's [Margie Ree Upchurch Lassiter] father [Claude Upchurch] in that regard?
Speaker 2: In that regard.  He was, he also did it on thirds as they called it because he owned his horses and his tools and so he ran the farms the way he wanted to.
Story_ID: 37410
Speaker 1: Now was your father [Narvie Hester Lassiter] able to go very far in school in that [Chatham] County [North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: At most he went to the seventh grade.  And, but he could read and he could write well.  Not the grammar part, none of that, but he could write and he could read well.  And at a early age--they had a tradition in that area that I saw as a child but didn't understand what was happening, but I understood later.  I understand it now.  When the sons became of age in my area, in my community their, his (laughter) community, you had to leave home.  You, you became an adult.  You had to go out on your own and I actually heard them refer to--we would go visit my grandparents on my mother's side and my father's side and you would ask for a particular uncle, and they would say, oh, daddy ran him off last week.  Daddy ran him off last month.  And it wasn't a negative thing.  The father wasn't being mean.  It was just time for him to leave the roost and that tradition is how my father kind of got out on his own.  And I think at first he worked at mills, lumber mills, saw mills.  And what would have to happen, you had to fend for yourself.  You had to cook for yourself or find a way to do it and so the territory was dotted with shanties, one room cabins and the young men would live in them, work wherever, mostly as a mill hands and that kind of things or they might work for somebody's farm and they would live in those shanties.  And I can recall seeing some and my father actually showed one or two just so we would know that the dimensions and just how stark they were.  So that's kind of how he started out and I think that was his status at the time that he met and married my mother [Margie Ree Upchurch Lassiter].  He was on his own.  I think he was twenty-five [years old], and once he married then he became a farmer, a tenant farmer.
Story_ID: 37411
Speaker 1: Now is there is a story about how your parents [Narvie Hester Lassiter and Margie Ree Upchurch Lassiter] met, that they tell?
Speaker 2: They use to entertain myself and my siblings telling about their courtship.  Over and over and over they would tell us, and the fun of it was just as I now understand how mates do, they always tell it from their perspective and whoever's telling it is the hero and the one who always had the upper hand and it's always your father, my mother would say, walked thirty miles to see me.  He walked all the way from wherever to see me and he could only stay a little bit of time.  In order to get back home he had to leave and head back and so she would tell those tales and he would say, oh I was coming that way anyway.  I was also going to do this or that.  I wasn't just coming to see you and we would press them as kids to tell us about the time he did this or he did that.  And one of her favorite stories is that my father was playing with, had a knife, pocket knife, and they were sitting in a courting room, living room, or whatever it was and my father had the knife and her father, my grandfather [Claude Upchurch], came by and upgraded him and told him, and I can remember the quote "Mind your playing boy," you know, because (laughter) he had the knife out and all of that and she, then she would elaborate on and if he had not put it away, or if he hadn't acted stubborn, or if he had rebelled in anyway what my father would have done to him.  Then it's my father's turn to say, oh that old man wouldn't have done this.  I would have done that.  And if I've heard that story once, I've heard it fifty times and every time you hear it gets a little better (laughter), depending on who was telling it.  But apparently they--I can't recall how long they courted, but it was the standard go through the motions of how people courted back then.  You come, first you ask permission, "Can I come see your daughter?"  And then when you come you got to spend a little time with the father and then they kind of withdraw and then you all court.  And then you got to the courtesy thing when you leave and they went through all of that and so she was eighteen [years old] when they got married and he was twenty-five and they moved to not far from where they courted to Carpenter, North Carolina, a matter of miles.
Story_ID: 37412
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.  We're rolling again.  So your parents [Margie Ree Upchurch Lassiter and Narvie Hester Lassiter] got married.  This is 19--when is it?
Speaker 2: I can't remember the year off hand.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You were born in '39 [1939], right?
Speaker 2: I was born in '36 [1936].
Speaker 1: '36 [1936].  Okay.
Speaker 2: I have an older brother who was born two years before me, and they got married--he was born shortly after they got married.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they were born, I say about 1934--
Speaker 2: Yeah,--
Speaker 1: --or '33 [1933], '34[1934]
Speaker 2: --it's either '33 [1933] or '34 [1934] that they got married.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, kind of tell us about your brothers and sisters, how many do you have and where do you fall in there?
Speaker 2: Okay.  It's eight of us, and I'm them, I have one older brother.  I'm second.  Then there's a four year gap and a sister.
Speaker 1: You can name them if you want.
Speaker 2: Okay.  My older brother born in 1934 is Willis Clarence Lassiter, named after that grandfather [Clarence Lassiter; paternal], and then I'm second, and then Mary--that noise is picking up, Louise [addressing off-camera]..
Speaker 1: Mary, you said.
Speaker 2: The first girl after me is Mary Gladys Lassiter.  Then Jean Elizabeth Lassiter.  Then Janie Carolyn Lassiter. Then Louis Irvin Lassiter.  Then Raymond Howard Lassiter.  And the last girl Ava Bonita Lassiter, born in 1959.
Speaker 1: So is that like six or seven--
Speaker 2: It's eight, altogether.
Speaker 1: Eight, eight altogether.
Speaker 2: Seven siblings.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 37413
Speaker 1: And when you think about your parents' [Margie Ree Upchurch Lassiter and Narvie Hester Lassiter] talents and dispositions and even the way they looked, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I look particularly as I grow older, I look in the mirror now, and I see my father.  I look like him now.  As a child, I didn't see that much resemblance, but I really look like him when he was this age and when he was in his forties as I look back I realize I looked like he looked.  When I was forty, I looked like when he was forty.  So I take a lot after him and the stature, we're short and we're chunky, broad shoulders, I call it no neck. (laughter) short neck.  That's a Hackney trait, my [paternal] grandmother [Daisy Jane Hackney], my uncles had that trait.  So that's very prominent in me and my siblings.  So we take our stature, particularly the males and even the girls from my father.  The face, the facial make-up particularly in the girls come from the mother, the broad round, what we used to call a dish face comes from my mother's side.  And her uncles had that kind of make-up, broad flat face.  The complexion is kind of mix.  On my mother's side, the African, real dark complexion was prominent, beautiful, black, really black skin and that kind of faded out in my generation.  So it's more of Hackney, brownish complexion, but we use to love our uncles on my mother's side, their complexion.  They were really, really dark and white eyes and white teeth and they used to flash that smile and my grandmother, Bethenie [Baker], my mother's mother, had some lankiness and that came out in my mother's brothers.  But it didn't come out in my siblings and myself.  Her brothers were tall, handsome guys, really made an impression when they came into a room or into an area just by their stature, but we took on the Hackney trait, short, blunt, big chested and so that comes through my father from his mother.  His father was short, and rotund, round head, round face, round body, very strong, took a lot of pride in his strength.  That's my father's father.  So much so that even when things were invented to make work easy, he wouldn't use it.  He wanted to do it the hard way because he had the muscles and the strength and that came out in my father.  My father had a broad chest, huge muscles, could pick up 200 pounds in each arm and just take a walk.  We didn't inherit that, or maybe we just got smarter, my brothers and I.  (Laughter)  We choose not to do it that way.
Speaker 1: Probably hours of not--
Speaker 2: (Laughter)
Speaker 1: --working on a farm probably--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --softened you all up.
Speaker 2: If there's an easier way, we tried to learn it.  But disposition in all of us is a combination of how my mother was and how my father was, and I really appreciate that now because my father, he was not a plotter but he was cautious in terms of making decisions.  He wanted to think things through.  My mother liked to act quickly and growing up I really cherished my father's way.  Think it through and then act, and secretly I admired that tremendously to the detriment of how I judged my mother.  Although I showed more love for my mother, I admired my father's way of doing things until I got older and then what I learned was, it was the combination that marriage, their coming together that made things work.  Without her he would have plotted too long and without his caution we would have made some dangerous decisions in terms of when to move to another farm and that kind of thing.  But they were a perfect blend.  She would push him when he wasn't moving fast enough, and he would slow her down when were moving too fast.  I could appreciate now.  I, then it was just them doing things.  We listened and watched, but it was a good combination, and I really am glad at how it worked out.  But they both were extremely unique in their approach to life.
Story_ID: 37414
Speaker 1: They [Lassiter's parents, Margie Ree Upchurch Lassiter and Narvie Hester Lassiter] were both really high on education, and we didn't know as youngsters what was happening, but they told me late in life that they made an agreement when they got married that they were gonna see that all the children got through high school and not have to go through what they had gone through as kids in terms of not being able to go to school.  So although we were farmers, and the tradition and the pattern in our community was have as many children as you can.  White people would get tenants who had many children and the second part of it was you keep them out to work that crop when necessary and that's what was going on when I was growing up.  The farmers, other black farmers, thirteen kids and this kind of thing.  Kids didn't get to go to school maybe two months out of the year.  We almost never missed a day.  If we missed three days out of a year it was because we were sick or the bus broken down.  They bused us to our schools and that kind of thing.  And I was out of college having a conversation with my father and I asked him about that, and he said he and my mother agreed when they got married they were gonna do whatever was necessary, gone work as hard as they had to, work as many hours as they had to, to make sure we went to school.  And so that's what happened, and we did and they went to PTA [Parent Teacher Association].  My father would work plowing, two-horse plow, all day long and then come home, take a bath, and take us to PTA would be twenty miles away, after we got a car. That was in later years, and they would religiously go to PTA and participate in it and check up on us.  They'd go see every teacher and see how we were doing, how we were behaving, what our grades were?  And it was a real thing when you brought your report card home, sit you around the table and you--if you didn't have As and Bs and Cs and if your deportment grade wasn't really to their satisfaction, you got a lecture and how important it is that you go.  This is how I want you to behave and this kind of thing.  And it's made all the differences in our lives.  We didn't realize what a sacrifice it was until we would look back, and all of us finished high school and all of us eventually went to college.  I was the first to go and get a degree.
Speaker 2: --All-- --All of my siblings--
Speaker 1: --All eight?
Speaker 2: All eight have attended, didn't finish, all of them, but all of them went to some college because after I went I passed the idea down that, okay, we help the next one.  We help the next one.  My older brother went back late in life and got his AA, and did some work after that and then he's studying, he became a minister like my grandfather.  And then he's done seminary study.  But all of them went to some junior college or training school based on what our parents had put in us that you take it further if you can.  But the thing that I am emphasizing is the idea came from our parents.  They were set on us getting education.  Back then if you went high school, finished high school, you've done pretty good.  Now, you know, it needs to be college so the younger sister who was born the year I came out of college, we enrolled in college at A and T and insisted that she go and that kind of thing.

Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I guess the thing that I remember most in terms of nostalgia early, early--
Speaker 1: Yeah, the first thing--
Speaker 2: --were the--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --that you remember.
Speaker 2: --the Christmases when it was just my brother [Willis Clarence Lassiter] and I as children before the others came.  Christmas was very special in two ways.  One the toys were just, I don't know to describe them.  Mechanically, my father [Narvie Hester Lassiter] always chose something that did something extremely unique.  He bought my brother a Lionel train back when having a Lionel train was kind of rare, that would smoke.  It would choo-choo.  The light in front would come on.  It went around on a little track and make the train noises and a caboose and all of that.  I can remember him buying me a plane, airplane, that once you wound it up and the propellers started spinning.  It either had guns or something.  It would spark like they were firing and that kind of thing.  I remember a truck that one of us got one Christmas that had figures in it with large heads sticking up out of the truck.  But the unique part was when it would go forward until it bumped into something, the figures would turn their heads in the other direction, and it would start backing up until it bumped into something.  And they would turn the other way and they would go.  And I, you can't forget (laughter) toys like that, and that's--the Christmases were unique.  And then as other kids came, it was, they couldn't go to that extent and later we always got a toy, but the emphasis became on the fruits and the nuts and the candy and the things that my mother [Margie Ree Upchurch Lassiter] would bake.  So I still remember the smell of the house at Christmas when she would bake five and six cakes.  And she would do the rolls and you could smell the yeast, and she made a big to-do out of making the rolls and then showing them to us and putting them behind the stove and covered them over because they were going to rise and she would tell us, now you watch how large they're gonna be tomorrow morning and this kind of thing.  And to a child that's kind of fascinating.  So I have very cherished memories about the smells of Christmas and those are kind of the, one of the early memories.
Story_ID: 37416
Speaker 1: What about the sights and sounds?
Speaker 2: Well we lived where I was born [Carpenter, North Carolina] until I was about seven [years old], and my sister was born there, the older sister, Gladys [Mary Gladys Lassiter].  And we lived near train tracks and we lived near a lumber mill.
Speaker 1: About how many rooms?
Speaker 2: We had a kitchen and three, two bedrooms.  This was the landowner's house.  We just lived in it as tenants, and what we called a front room where you had your best furniture and entertain guests and it had a hall that ran the length of the house and that hallway was fronted by a porch.  So I can remember that house very well and it fronted on a gravel, dirt road.  Carpenter, the area that I mentioned that I was born in, consisted just two country stores, one on each side of the road, one building where the stores stored things and that was delivered by train.  So that train that we could hear was on a track that ran through the middle of Carpenter.  And that's all there was there, the two stores, the track train and the storage place and then it became residential.  And half a mile from that was the lumber mill.  So in terms of sounds, you were never without the noise from the train or the lumber mill, the whistles.  And if you walked which my father [Narvie Hester Lassiter] made it an adventure to walk by the mill to the country store, so about a mile and a half from where we lived.  So one of my early memories is walking with my father and my brother [Willis Clarence Lassiter] to the country store where the farmers would gather and chit chat and run the government down and talk about neighbors and brag about their hound dogs and their hunting skills and brag about their crops.
Speaker 1: Can you give me an idea of, who was in the community?  Was it mostly a black community, or?
Speaker 2: It was mostly a white community, but it was mixed because the tenants for the most part were black.  But there were some white people who also tenant farmed.  But the landowners were mostly white, all white.  I don't remember any black person owning any land.  So it was a mixed community, but it was, you lived separately.  You worked together, but the divide between haves and haves not was very clear, and it was primary along racial lines.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But when you gathered at the store, everybody was there but there was a protocol, you know.  A black person buying waited until he was absolutely sure no white person was getting ready to buy (laughter) anything, then he sidled up to the counter.
Speaker 1: That would take a lot of time, wouldn't it?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 37417
Speaker 1: So if you were with your father [Narvie Hester Lassiter] you'd hear a lot of conversation [at the local store as they waited for service] I guess--
Speaker 2: That is, that's what made it entertaining.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: And that's part of my father's make-up was he had a gift for gab, and he had charisma. And he--and he was very respected as a farmer and as a person.  So he could engage in the conversation.  If they wanted to talk about what's going on in terms of crops and stuff, his opinions were valued because he was a good farmer and the farm we lived on, the male owner died and so we were tenant-farming for the widow and she didn't know a thing about farming.  So my father ran the farm for her after her husband died.  So that gives you some idea of the respect he had as a farmer, and his reputation was absolutely, you know, he paid his bills and mind his business.  That kind of thing.  So he was respected so the conversation, he was in the middle of the conversations.  And he told jokes that they liked to hear and so it was a treat to go to the store and one of the most valuable things I ever heard him say related to that because he would always buy a five cent soda pop for myself and my brother and a five cent bag of peanuts.  But I knew he didn't have any money.  But he always held something back to do that for us.  So when I was a grown man, I asked him about it 'cause although he always told us to be thrifty and save your Sunday School money and save your other money.  So I asked him when I was grown, I would say--matter of fact married, out of college and I was visiting home.  And I asked him why would he spend his last dime to buy us sodas when I knew he didn't have any money and this kind of thing and what he said was, I'll never forget, he said I figure if I could buy you all happiness for a dime, I was getting off cheap.  (Laughter)  And so he knew what he was doing and that was kind how he ran the house.  We were poor.  It was hard.  It was a struggle, but he always had a way of distracting us from our circumstances either by philosophical stories or jokes or entertaining us or just keeping our minds off and he did the same things when we--it was part of his make-up, part of what I admire about him.  We would be laboring but he would take our minds off it, by either telling us stories like you're asking about, or sharing his dreams that someday we're going to own our own farm.  And this is how we're going to do it.
Speaker 1: And did he ever reach his--(unclear) (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: He did, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That very farm that my grandfather worked as a tenant-farmer, eighty-eight acres, my father bought--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --one year before I went to college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He paid $7,000.00 for the whole 88 acres.  Now one of those acres is worth $15,000.00.
Story_ID: 37418
Speaker 1: Now, tell me, now what did you like to do coming up?  I mean, I know when you were coming up I guess there was no television, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Not until the year I went off to college.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you remember the radio shows and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you have a radio or did you access--
Speaker 2: We had.  First we had access to our neighbor's radio to a degree for big things.  He was a tenant-farmer too, but he was white and he had a radio.  And one of my earliest experiences is when Joe Louis fought Max Schmeling [boxing], we went to his farm, his house, to listen to the fight.  And when Joe knocked him out, our neighbor got up and turned the radio off.  We never heard (laughter) the rest of it.
Speaker 1: So do you think that he was for Max Schmeling?
Speaker 2: I get the feeling (laughter) he was for Max Schmeling.  But, of course, I didn't understand it at the time.  I didn't know what the dynamics of it was, but I recall.
Speaker 1: So do you think that black people, you know, that Joe Louis had a special meaning for the black folks in those days?
Speaker 2: He was Cassius Clay [Muhammad Ali] of the time.  He was symbolic of hope for the race.  Just like a King [Martin Luther King, Jr.], or Jackson [Rev. Jesse Jackson] or that's still prevalent with us.  So much of what we dream and hope about is wrapped up in symbolic individuals and that's why our president, so much of what our hopes are embodied in him as part of the weight that he has.  Well, Joe Louis had the same thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But later we had our own radio and my mother [Margie Ree Upchurch Lassiter] loved 'When a Girl Married' soap operas.  I remember--this is not in Carpenter [North Carolina], but later, listening to the 'Shadow', the 'Lone Ranger', things like that.  And I often talk to my wife and to younger people how amazing it was and a show like the 'Lone Ranger', and 'Amos & Andy', 'The Lone Ranger' was only fifteen minutes.  Most of that was commercials, Wheaties and Merita Bread sponsored them.
Speaker 1: What kind of bread?
Speaker 2: M-E-R-I-T-A.
Speaker 1: Merita.  Okay, that's a local brand of bread?
Speaker 2: I guess it was.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: When it went out I'm not sure. But it was the big bread at the time and so only about at most 7-1/2 minutes was devoted to action, but to us as kids it seemed like at least an hour.  We would--and all you heard was "Cut him at the paths", or "You go into town," "I'm gonna to ride East," "You follow me," clabboty (ph.), clack, and that's all there was.  And we were so devoted to it, my brother [Willis Clarence Lassiter] and I, that we should be out in the yard cutting up wood for the night and my mother sent us out there.  That's our chore for that evening after school, go get the wood ready.  You're not going to listen to the 'Lone Ranger'. You're going out and do the chores.  We take a drop cord, run it out the window under the house where she couldn't see out to the woodshed, put it under a wash tub, put the radio under the washtub and we're sawing woods and listening to the Lone Ranger (laughter).  And she never caught us.  (laughter)  That's how devoted we were to it.  So radio was extremely big.  But we also had a wind-up record player, Progressive owned they called it at the time, which I had here until recently.  It finally fell apart.  I kept it all that long.
Speaker 1: Umm.
Speaker 2: But part of the entertainment was playing records on that wind-up phonograph player.
Story_ID: 428431
Speaker 1: Did you like 'Amos 'n' Andy' [sitcom]?
Speaker 2: I loved Amos 'n' Andy.  Most blacks loved Amos & Andy.  It wasn't until the '50s [1950s], '60s [1960s] and this kind of thing, when we realized the majority's laugh was not based on the same thing that we were laughing at.  And we started to dislike Amos 'n' Andy.  We had no idea that parts were being played by white people and others.  But we could identify with the jokes.  We could identify with the language, the situations.  The writers knew the folklore of black people pretty good.  So we loved Amos & Andy.  And at Christmas they would do that serious piece in which they explained the Lord's Prayer.  And I remember being confused the first time I caught on that this is not, they're not playing tonight.  What's going on?  And this is serious.  And then I realized it's Christmas and they're teaching, and I still remember that and the rest of the time.  One of the things that I learned and liked about Kingfish was that he played that henpecked man role, and I would have disliked that as an adult except he got his way in the end.  So it taught me a little about how to be married, (laughter) just listening Amos 'n' Andy, that you don't--that it's not what people make it out to be in couples' relationship.  That everybody who appears henpecked or every wife who appears to be overbearing, it's necessary.  It's good dynamics, and I learned that just from listening to Amos 'n' Andy.
Story_ID: 428432
Speaker 1: Now did you get newspapers at your house?
Speaker 2: We didn't subscribe.  What we got was and why I'm not sure.  We got old papers from the big house, from the landowners.  They wasn't so much the newspapers that we cherished, it was the magazines.  That was the period of 'Life' and 'Look' magazines when they were in their heyday.
Speaker 1: Now did your mother [Margie Ree Upchurch Lassiter] do day work in the white people's house, homes?
Speaker 2: Very little.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was consumed by being a housewife and worked fields.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And had all those kids.  So she mothered us beautifully.  Worked the fields and ran the house.  In addition, she ran her own business.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was an Avon-type person before there was Avon.
Speaker 1: It's Lucky--
Speaker 2: --Lucky Strike--Lucky Heart.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she did that.
Speaker 1: Lucky Heart.  Now can you give us some history about what Lucky Heart was?
Speaker 2: The only thing I know is how it worked for her.  The company and this kind, I don't know.  But the line was toiletries, the lotions, the perfumes and the deodorants and no medicines, but just toiletries for men and women.  And she would take orders.  She had a sample case of different products, and she would show the samples and push it.  And she would convince people who had no money hardly that you needed this to stay pretty, to hold your husband, to be a lady.  She convinced them you need this.  And so sold them and so she always had an order coming and going.  She had people putting in the order and she would fill it.  And then they would either come and pick it up, or she would, when she could find a way, deliver it.  But you're talking about in a small--most of them she could deliver walking from neighbor's houses and this kind of thing.  But I remember she worked it a long time.  And one of my childhood memories is once--one of the products we were going to my grandmother's house, and she had the sample case and one of the products broke and the car smelled sweet (Laughter) for I don't know how long because of, you know, I could remember that because that stuff spilled out.  And as I remember it was mostly colored, good smelling useless (Laughter) stuff.  But so is what you buy now.
Speaker 1: Most cosmetics (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah so.  And she also sold candy.  She would order it somehow and then she had a good luck board.  You pick a number and whatever was under it, you paid the price for the products, something (unclear).  But she made, there was a profit in it and she did that and then later she sold produce.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Milk and butter and eggs.  So she was an entrepreneur in addition to being a housewife, mother and working the fields.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But you said you did get like some of the mainstream magazines--
Speaker 2: We got the mainstream magazines--
Speaker 1: --after they were used.
Speaker 2: Yeah, after they were used, stacks and stacks of them.  And that was part of how I got into being a read-aholic.
Speaker 1: Now how did you get them?  I mean, how.  The mean the--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: After they were used, was there a formal process of him giving them to--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: They would stack them up and when my father [Narvie Hester Lassiter] would go up--I always refer to big house.  The landowner lived in it.  It wasn't all that big, but it seemed big then, brickhouse, a very fine brickhouse and they would stack them on the back porch and he would bring them home, and we would enjoy looking at them.  One of the things I most remember was during the Second World War.  The 'Look Magazine' pictures of the bombs raining down.  It was probably before your time.  But the photographers were really, if you go to the library, it was beautiful pictures on the cover.  A B29 or B24 flying over and the bombs are raining down, looked like a chain almost.  And I remember the beauty of it.  I had no idea of the destruction and the death that went with it.  But the pictures always attracted my attention, and this was during the time of the Jane Russell's and ladies like that.  And they made a big display of that kind of photography.  But by being introduced to the magazines young, later I learned to read them and appreciate that they were good magazines and good information--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and all of that.  And it bothered me to see them dwindle, you know, in our times--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --'cause I remember them, and they were big, thick, beautiful.
Speaker 1: Do you remember getting any of the black newspapers, like the 'African-American', or the--
Speaker 2: No.  I didn't become acquainted with black newspapers until my high school days.  I went to school in Raleigh, North Carolina and there's a black paper in Raleigh.  'The Carolinian' I think it was called, and I became acquainted because it was in our school library.
Story_ID: 428433
Speaker 1: Okay, now, let me take you to school and your first school.  What was the name of your first elementary school?
Speaker 2: Apex Elementary.
Speaker 1: Apex.  So you had to go Apex, North Carolina for that?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And that was about how far away?
Speaker 2: In junior high, elementary to junior high, where we lived, not that far from where I was born, it was 20--it was sixteen miles to school.
Speaker 1: And how did you get there?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) We were bused.  As a matter of fact, we--let me take you back to elementary.  I went there as an elementary student.  We were living where I was born in Carpenter [North Carolina].  There was a school 1-1/2 miles from where I lived, a white school, just walk down the road, 1-1/2 miles.  It was elementary school.  Across the street from the elementary--road, from the elementary school, was the bus driver for the bus we had to walk down and get on which is across the road from the white school.  Get on the bus and drive, ride, sixteen miles to get to Apex.  School right in the back door.  My aunt, lived with us worked, down there as a janitress at the school.  The janitor at that school, white school, was black and he would hire us as kids to come down help him clean it up in the summer.  It was as far from where I lived as that first street out there.  But we couldn't go there.  We had to get on a bus and ride sixteen miles to elementary school.
Speaker 1: Now, did it take a long time to get there?  I guess it would take--.
Speaker 2: He had to stop and pick up people.  It took an hour and a half or more.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: So, if you got up and got ready to go by--well, how soon would you have to be ready?
Speaker 2: It would just barely be light, maybe seven [o'clock].  School took in probably at eight [o'clock], and I'm not remembering this precisely.  The school took in maybe 8:00 or 8:15.  That rings a bell in my head.  So we had to leave home 7:00 or 7:15, which means you had to get up thirty minutes earlier or so than that.  And when you're picking up, you fill the bus up, and you didn't go a straight route.  You know you could take a straight road to Apex and be there, but you got to go wander through communities and get close enough to pick up black people from all kinds of places.  It was a consolidated school.  So there were kids at the Apex School from my direction.  There were buses coming from every other direction and bringing the black kids, passing by white schools and there was a school, white school in Apex that kids lived in Apex couldn't go to.  They had to come to consolidated school.
Story_ID: 428434
Speaker 1: Now what kind of student were you?
Speaker 2: I was an excellent student.  I made good grades because we attended every day and because we were encouraged.  We were expected.  Grandparents, parents [Margie Ree Upchurch Lassiter and Narvie Hester Lassiter] expected us to make good grades.  And we didn't have to be convinced that that was the least we could do because we knew how hard our parents were working, the hours they were putting in and the kind of work.  It would have been so much easy on them, and we knew this if we had stayed home and worked all day, particularly my brother [Willis Clarence Lassiter] and I.  And then in later years, when he had maybe four kids, he could have increased the acreage and the landowner would have done very well.
Speaker 1: They were convinced there's a different way, a better way.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They knew--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --they knew what they were doing.
Speaker 1: Okay. And they never complained about it.  They didn't want it any other way.
Speaker 2: Now, did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 1: I was drawn toward the reading oriented.  I liked math, did well in math, but it was not my better subject.  I liked the reading, literature, science kind of things.  And I liked being in plays and what they call operetta.  So I participated in the extra-curricular.  I did the sports stuff but I was not good in it.  So I was what they call an awkward child.  (Laughter)  So, I was one of the, not the last one chosen to play softball, but I was close. (Laughter)
Speaker 2: Okay, but you all had operettas in--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in elementary school?
Speaker 1: In elementary school and--
Speaker 2: You would have a sing an opera? Yeah, you had to sing a part, speak a part, and I always had a lead part.  The biggest one I remember was called "Sunny of Sunnyside."  It was about a little girl.  She supposed to be sunny all the time and something made her blue that particular day.  And I could still remember some of the lines from it.  But then another big one had to do with, I was the Indian Chief and I can still remember some of the lines.  "I am the Chief of the Tomahawks" and the group behind me would say "Tomahawk, Tomahawk, Tomahawk."  So it was an operetta.  (Laughter)
Speaker 1: "Sunny and Sunnyside."
Speaker 2: "Sunny of Sunnyside."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I remember a line from one of the girls.  They couldn't find Sunny, and she blew the line.  She said, "All over the neighborhood I have looked and not a Sunny can I found."  (Laughter)  I remember the humor that created when she said it that--.  We would do it in school because we had assemblies every week, or every other week.  And all the classes would come, and at the end of the year you did the operetta.  But then we do it again at the PTA [Parent Teacher Association] and the parents would come.  And so you got to do the operetta twice.
Speaker 1: This is one of the PTA meetings at the school?
Speaker 2: At the school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 428435
Speaker 1: How big was the school [Apex Elementary School, North Carolina]?  And how many students and about what size building was it?
Speaker 2: I don't know how to describe it.  It had, it was reasonably large.  When my mother [Margie Ree Upchurch Lassiter] went there, it was small and then they built two wings onto it and I would say that each wing--it was sea-shaped.  The auditorium was here.  That was there at my mother's time.  Then they built a wing over here and, let's say a West Wing and East Wing.  And each one of those wings must have had five rooms and a hall and then the auditorium and some rooms on the side of that.  So it was larger than the one, it was quite a step up from the one-room schoolhouse day.  This was the beginning of upgrading that kind of thing.  But it was consolidated where all the one-room schools that kids had been going to, they pulled them out of those schools and brought them to that school.  So it was one--it was reasonably large, but one school--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --serving for miles in all four directions.
Speaker 1: About how many students in the whole school?
Speaker 2: Now, honestly I cannot--I cannot estimate.  I--well, maybe I can.  The auditorium probably held 300.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that would be the whole student body?
Speaker 2: That would the whole, that would be it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Everybody came.  It filled up, at most 300.
Speaker 1: Now, did, were you.  How was your equipment?  Was it, did you get the cast-off books--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --or did you get new books?
Speaker 2: We got--every book you got already was filled up with names from somebody else.  Somebody else had had them, and the buses were hand me downs.  All the new buses went to the white school and then two years later after they'd run them for two to three years, we would get them and keep them forever.  I can remember when we got the first new school bus.  I was getting ready to finish junior high.  We got a new school bus.
Story_ID: 428436
Speaker 1: Now, your family had a car, you said, you remember they had a--
Speaker 2: We bought a car just before we moved from where I lived.  So that had to be about 1941 or '41 [1941].  We bought a 1929 Ford A Model.
Speaker 1: So you were about five [years old], I guess?
Speaker 2: Five or six.
Speaker 1: Okay, five or six.  It was a 1929 A-Model Ford.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  Interestingly, well, it's interesting to me, one of my memories.  That same country store I'm talking about and it was about a mile, two miles from where this bus that I had get on, that family, he bought an A-Model Ford the same day--I mean same time.  And he and my father--no, he bought a Buick, a 1940, must have been a 1941 Buick.  He had nineteen children and he never let them go to school.  So he had a huge crop, made money, didn't know what to do with it and bought a car.
Speaker 1: He bought a Buick which is a step up.
Speaker 2: Bought a Buick, yes.  And so my father [Narvie Hester Lassiter] challenged him to a race from the store to his house, '29 [1929] Ford.  And to tell you something about my father, and a '41 Buick.  So, the man accepted the challenge.  So they jumped in the car and my father beat him.  And I asked him about that years later, and he said well it was a Ford.  It was little, and we didn't have far to go.  By the time he could get his revved up, I'm gone.  (Laughter) And if we had a few more miles, he would've killed me, you know.  (Laughter)  That's how my father worked life.  (Laughter)  So he beat him.  And the man was crestfallen, but my father knew he was going to beat him.  He knew why he was gonna beat him.  (Laughter)  He knew how he was going to beat him, and that tells you as much about my father as there is to know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's how he ran life.  He did things like that.  My brother [Willis Clarence Lassiter] and I talk about it now and it is amazing how he would beat--how he would survive the system.  He didn't beat the system.  How he survived the system, using just that kind of wit.

Speaker 1: Now tell me, did you have any mentors or special teachers in school that took a particular interest in you?
Speaker 2: All of them did all along the way.  Of course, there were some special.  But because of the grades and because of the potential, teachers in those days really wanted success for you and if you showed ability and interest, they worked with you.  I feel now perhaps they lean too much towards the bright ones in the world.  It's still that way.  Some of the others probably needed it too, you know.  But they worked with you and if you--they made sure you were in the plays.  They made sure you, we had something called supplemental readers.  And if you were kind of at the head of your class, these books stayed on the shelf until you got through the others.  Well the plotters never got through the required books.  But if you had potential, they made sure you got to the supplemental readers.  And so that's how you got to read biographies and read about famous people if you were kind of at the top of your class, things that the kids who were not at the top of the class never got exposed to it.  It was there, but they hadn't gotten through the required stuff.  And so they made sure you got the required.  So in ways like that, and if there were conventions, since they were consolidated, it was a consolidated situations then you had, there were other consolidated schools.  And those schools, periodically, would have conventions for the Glee Clubs, other clubs, 4-H Club, that kind of thing.  They made sure you got to go to those kinds of things.  They made sure you got to do inter--I recall introducing a state legislator when I was a little boy.  Well, I understood he was he was a big--I didn't understand state legislator, but I knew he was a big man and it was an honor to present him.  And you're the one chosen to do that.  So in those kinds of ways, you got mentored.  You got pushed ahead and try to make sure you maximize the limited opportunities that were there.
Speaker 1: Now did you do things like run for class officer, anything like that, when you were there?
Speaker 2: I was always a class officer.  I don't volunteer--give you an example.  This is the third time you all have asked me to be interviewed.  I don't volunteer for a lot of things.  (Laughter)  But I would, my classmates would always nominate me to be and so I was always vice-president, president of everything that could be, vice-president of--and that was a great experience.  You know, I really would have cheated myself if I had been left to my own devices because I would never have done it.  I was a quiet person, and I don't like attention.  I don't like to be the center of attention.  But my classmates always nominated me and then I would go play the role and I enjoyed it and I tried to do a good job.  So when you look at the record I was either president, vice-president of the major clubs, the class, all the way through.  And it was very valuable in terms of learning how to lead and how to run a meeting and stuff like that.
Story_ID: 428438
Speaker 1: Now was church very important to you--(unclear)
Speaker 2: Extremely.  Because of my father [Narvie Hester Lassiter] being a minister and a role that he played in church and something the Hackney family that I mentioned, loaded with preachers.  They founded the church that became our community church although it was far away.  It was located where my father was born.  But we, he stayed attached to it although he lived twenty miles away when we lived at Carpenter [North Carolina].  As we moved from farm to farm, he moved back in his direction of the farm he eventually bought and that church.  So the history of that church and my family are interwoven.  They founded it.  They were the pastors, names on the cornerstones and all of that.  Then my grandfather, Clarence, the way they organized churches out in the country because they were far apart, they organized them into unions.  Then the union was organized into an association.  For twenty-seven years, my grandfather who could not read, but the moderator for the association and for many years president of the union,  He had all of the ministers in that area were under him, and many of them were doctors of divinity, educated from Shaw University there in Raleigh [North Carolina] and all around.  But his leadership skills and his stature and his Christianity, and the way he lived it, he stayed moderator for twenty-seven years.  So church was central to my upbringing.
Speaker 1: Now, what was the name of your church?
Speaker 2: New Hope Missionary Baptist Church.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, so, did the church provide leadership opportunities for you?
Speaker 2: Tremendous.  It was unique.  It was the center of the community.  It was in the middle of the country, you know, rural, fifteen miles outside of Durham, North Carolina.  But the people from Durham left town to go to church at New Hope.  It was that progressive and I don't remember the first church.  You know they kept rebuilding.  I do remember when, the second church and the rubble from the first church was still around.  I could remember it when I was a kid, and then they built a third church a few years ago, a million dollar church out there in the middle.  The judges from Durham, the people from the college, North Carolina Central attend that church.  Many--not all of them not all of them, but many of them.  That's the kind of church it was, and so my grandfather was associate pastor there and moderator of all of the churches for all those years.  He took us--my father would follow his father and my father took us to the union meetings and the associations where he explained to us, look how its run, what the moderator does, what the committees do, how the sermons are structured?  You have educational sermons.  You have a doctrinal sermon and you have what he called an emotional sermon, and that was so the people who were educationally heavy could preach, and those who were less heavy there was a space for them.  We saw it all.
Story_ID: 37427
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell us about high school?  What was the name of your high school?
Speaker 2: Berry O'Kelly High School in Method, North Carolina.  It's a suburb of Raleigh [North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Okay.  How do you spell O'Kelly?
Speaker 2: O-'-K-E-L-L-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And it's in Method?
Speaker 2: Method.  It's a suburb of Raleigh.
Speaker 1: Method.  M-E-T-H-O-D.
Speaker 2: O-D.  That's, that was what it was called then.  Heaven only knows what it might be called now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there a story behind that name?  Method, North Carolina.
Speaker 2: Not that I ever heard.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well.  So this is a segregated high school too?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so it drew basically from the same group of students that went to grade school.
Speaker 2: By being in Raleigh which is twenty miles from Apex [North Carolina], when we finished elementary and junior high at Apex, we were bused to Raleigh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: By that time, my father [Narvie Hester Lassiter] has bought the farm, and we're living in Chatham County which is connected to Wake County where Raleigh is.  And this is necessary in order for you to understand getting to Berry O'Kelly.
Speaker 1: Is this closer to Berry O'Kelly?
Speaker 2: Farther away.
Speaker 1: Farther away.  Okay.
Speaker 2: So we, I leave--I graduate from Apex Elementary and I go to Berry O'Kelly High School in Raleigh which was a good thing because Berry O'Kelly had a good reputation.  It had been a private school, it had a campus, Teacher Ridge, principal's house was on the campus, founder's grave is on the campus.  There's a chapel on the campus, and high school building, and an agricultural building and this kind of thing.  It's pretty compared to Apex.
Speaker 1: Now, I just need to ask this.  I mean, can you confirm this.  Now, Berry O'Kelly was a black man who founded this school?
Speaker 2: It was named after him.  I'm not sure he founded it as such.  Now, I'm really not sure--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --how it transition--how it came into existence and how it transitioned to public from private?
Speaker 1: But he was a black person.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I met his daughter, Beryl O'Kelly once.  But--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm sure we were required to read the history and all of that.  But that was almost sixty years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Well, I just think it's always good to get the names--
Speaker 2: Yeah, true.
Speaker 1: --of the people that founded these schools, you know, it's probably some more history that somebody could follow-up on (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I tried to find the yearbook.  I'm sure it's in it.  But I couldn't find it around here.  I have it.  But I couldn't find it.  I'm sure it has a brief history.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in there, and I would have had that in that in my head.  So I went to Berry O'Kelly from Apex Elementary.
Speaker 1: Now did very many of your classmates go with you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: By what percentage? Would you think most of them?
Speaker 2: Yeah, most of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My senior class went.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that too pulled people from Apex but it also drew its students from Raleigh and other suburbs of Raleigh, black.  So now you have mostly kind of suburbanite kids at Berry O'Kelly.  But you also have, you have the city kids from Raleigh, some them coming to Berry O'Kelly.  Then you have kids from surrounding suburbs that's far away as, in other directions as Apex.  But the atmosphere was under the principle maintained, retained a lot of the private school atmosphere.  You had to wear a tie every day.  And if you didn't you had to take off your, take a shoestring and put it around your neck.  And the next day after that embarrassment, you would have a tie on.  And you had to wear a dress shirt and this kind of thing.  The curriculum was not strong compared to what a high school curriculum can be.  But it was strong for a black school.  I think it took you to plane geometry and that's about as far as we went in terms of math, which crippled me in college.  But the spirit of excellence was honed into you.
Story_ID: 37428
Speaker 1: Who was the principal [of Berry O'Kelly High School in Method, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Johnson.  What's his first name? I can't remember his first name right now.  His last name was Johnson.
Speaker 1: Did you call him Mr. Johnson or Professor Johnson?
Speaker 2: Mr. Johnson.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And if you had told me I would not remember his first name sitting here.  I'm surprised I don't remember.  And he was succeeded by Wilbur D. Moore in my junior year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We called Mr. Johnson by his nickname so much, I've forgotten his real name.
Speaker 1: What was his nickname?
Speaker 2: We called him Hoss.  H-O-S-S (laughter), 'cause he was a heavy man who wore soft sole shoes so he could move about and you wouldn't know it.  But what he didn't know because of his walk--he was not fat.  He was just thick.  We knew when he was coming because the floor would, it vibrated (laughter).  You knew and that kind of thing.  But he was very strict, very stern.  He was heavy into philosophy, I now understand.  So he was forever trying to inspire us by referring to the--to sayings of the philosophers.  "Eat, drink, and be merry for tomorrow you may die."  But if you don't die you're gonna need this education. (laughter)  If I heard that once, I heard it fifty times.  But he drummed it into us, and we understood after a while.  And so he used things like that to motivate us.  And he was a good principal and we appreciated it, just liked to pick on him.  Mr. Moore, who succeeded him was a mathematician.  And he took us as far as time would allow him in terms of upgrading our math skills.  And he was very high on character building and maximizing your brain skills.  And he fussed and taught and cajoled all the time trying to bring out the best in you.  One example he would used was his bricklayer story.  There's two kinds of bricklayers out there.  The skilled men and the boneheads he called them.  He said, the skilled guys go in and work a couple of hours and run the corners up on the building and they're through.  The boneheads lay bricks all day long in between the corners.  That's how it's done.  That's all they can do is lay a straight line of bricks.  It takes a lot of skill to do the corners.  And he was trying to show us that you can choose.  You can be the bonehead or you can maximize what you learn here and all through life, take to the highest level as you can, and those kinds of stories over and over and over.  He would feed us, trying to keep us going.  And he managed the Honor Society, the Crown & Scepter Club, it was the Honor's Society.  So he spent a lot of his time taking us to special levels, teaching us extra things that you didn't get in the classroom.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were a member of the Crown & Scepter Society?
Speaker 2: Crown & Scepter Club.  I guess I was president probably.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What kinds of things would you learn that other people didn't get?
Speaker 2: Well he would extend the math theory.  He couldn't take us to class and teach us trigonometry and this kind of thing, but he would let us know it existed.  And he would extend our under--he would try--he never used the terms sociology, and social logical underpinning anything like that.  But he tried to help us understand that there were laws and rules that governed how things happened, took place and how they could be managed and changed.  And he would do it on an academic level.  And because some of us had farming backgrounds, they also had, they taught agricultural kinds of courses.  And the instructor down there would try to take that same kind of attitude and perspective and relate it to what we really did which was farming, some of us.  So he would teach us.  I still remember some of it.  I believe in the dignity of farming.  And that I shall prosper in proportion as I learn to put knowledge and skills into the occupation of farming.  Tried to take us to a different--that's the kind of school it was.  So you got the chemistry.  You got the basic courses, the history.  They were very strong on teaching you history.  And they put in--this was not required by the state, but they put in a piece on black history.  That's where I learned about Tuskegee [University] for the first time.  That's how I ended up going there.
Speaker 1: This is in school, in high school?
Speaker 2: High school, yeah.  And so they definitely tried to prepare you for more than what you had gotten in elementary school and those kinds of things.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneous]
Story_ID: 37429
Speaker 1: So did they [Berry O'Kelly High School in Method, North Carolina] teach you about Booker T. Washington and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and George Washington Carver?
Speaker 2: George Washington Carver, Booker T., and the literary giants and made you learn the major poems, you know.
Speaker 1: Whose poems would you learn?
Speaker 2: Langston Hughes.  Countee Cullen, the major ones.  And so we would learn them, recite them, learn their biographies and this kind of thing.  I don't know that the state and county really knew that was going on. (laughter)  But they made a big deal of it.  And you might be assigned a person, and you would learn about them and you were that person for a week or whatever.  But I distinctly recall, really coincidental, that I learned about, that there was a Tuskegee, put it up there.  Forgot about it.  Then out of the blue in a history class somebody asked how many of you going to college.  So I raised my hand.  And I had no idea how I would get there.  Where are you going?  The only two that I could mention was Shaw [University, Raleigh, North Carolina], there in town and I remembered Tuskegee [University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  So I promised her I'm going to Tuskegee.  (Laughter)  But I was just talking.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 37430
Speaker 1: But they [Berry O'Kelly High School in Method, North Carolina], too, were very strong on giving you training in how to lead organizations, how to be president, how to be vice-president?  You got to do the role playing.  If you're in a position, you ran the organization.  And it was excellent training and learning.
Speaker 2: Now, did you run for any class officer or anything there?
Speaker 1: I was always a class officer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The way it worked in high school, my best friends were good students.  And one year if I was the president of the junior class, I would be vice-president of senior class and my buddy would be president.  We flipped flopped it.  We could have either position ,you know, and this kind of thing so we would, we would--if I was president of a class, he would be president of the, what's that security group, that--
Speaker 2: Patrol Board.
Speaker 1: Patrol.  We'd switch off and stuff like that.  But we were all--I was always in a leadership role.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Two or three every year.
Story_ID: 37431
Speaker 1: Now, tell me, you said you first encountered a black newspaper, 'The Raleigh'.  What'd you call it?
Speaker 2: I think it was the 'Carolinian' is the name of it.
Speaker 1: Carolinian, okay.
Speaker 2: It was in the library. And I ran across it.  And the other way that I knew it was there, my father [Narvie Hester Lassiter], after we moved to our own farm, would take my brother [Willis Clarence Lassiter] and I to Raleigh [North Carolina].  There was a black library there and he took us there to see it.  And there was a museum in Raleigh.  And he took us to that museum.
Speaker 1: What was the theme of the museum?
Speaker 2: It's a black, Afro-Americans.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, this some time before--
Speaker 2: Long before.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  The wave of black museums hit the U.S.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Raleigh was fortunate to have it. And he knew it.  And he would take us to Durham because it had a black bank.  C.C. Spaulding.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they had Mutual Insurance Company.  So he took us to those sites while we were in high school.
Speaker 1: Now what was the name of the museum? Do you remember?
Speaker 2: I can't remember the museum.  I know the library was the Richard B. Harrison Library.  But I can't remember--
Speaker 1: Now Richard B. Harrison if I'm not mistaken, was an actor, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I think so too.
Speaker 1: Was he from that part of the country?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  'Cause I know a lot, many cities, including Chicago [Illinois], had a Richard B. Harrison (unclear) Players,--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --and they, you know, out of the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association], they would do plays, you know, they--
Speaker 2: So those kinds of things.  I was talking about the kind of father I had.  Those are the kinds of things he did that I didn't question at the time in terms of why are you doing this?  We loved it.  We enjoyed it.  But as I look back, he knew what he was doing.  We didn't know what he was doing. (Laughter)  But he knew what he was doing.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did the--now, this museum, I'm still fascinated by this.  What was in it basically?
Speaker 2: Just memorabilia and pictures of literary figures and (unclear) ports and people out of history.  The names would be a little bit familiar from the classes we'd had and this kind of thing.  So we saw it as us doing things, good things--he didn't preach it.  And he didn't know enough about it to, you know, now you must be like or this man stood for this or that.  It was just the atmosphere.  And that it's there, and it had been done and it sank in.
Story_ID: 37432
Speaker 1: Okay, now you say got copies of, used copies of 'Look' and 'Life' magazines--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and that sort of thing.  Did you ever--was there ever a time when you were in high school student that you ran across a black journalist or wanted to emulate any kind of journalist?
Speaker 2: No.  I got interested in journalism as a senior at Berry O'Kelly [High School, Method, North Carolina] because they had students doing their internships from Shaw [University, Raleigh, North Carolina].  And they were gonna be a teacher, they would come and do their internships at Berry O'Kelly from Shaw University, St. Augustine [Saint Augustine's College, Raleigh].  It seemed like there was another one, but I--the name escapes me.  They would come over and they would be assigned.  And one year they sent too many in practice teachers.  And they had one teacher without an assignment.  But they didn't send her back to the campus.  They told her--I now understand, create a newspaper.  The school doesn't have a newspaper.  So she started a newspaper.  And I think I was the editor of it.  You know, I told you I gravitated to the top of things.  I didn't know anything about journalism, called the 'Busy Bee'. (Laughter) And I became editor of the 'Busy Bee' and I got fascinated.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have any kind of popular culture notion of what an editor does, or what they, you know?
Speaker 2: At that time?
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: No.  It was like being president to me.  You run it and you--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Did you write some of the articles there?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I really, I can't remember writing an editorial or anything like that.
Speaker 1: Did you get--well the paper came out, right, I guess?
Speaker 2: It came out.  We probably put out two--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --one first semester and one second semester, a lot of poems and--. that.
Story_ID: 37433
Speaker 1: Well, what about favorite teacher at Berry O'Kelly [High School, Method, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: I guess Mr. [Wilbur D.] Moore [principal] was my favorite.  I got to be a student assistant in his office and I got a feel for there's more to running a school than discipline, you know, being a disciplinarian.  I got to see all of the things he had to hold together, and answer the phone, take messages to the teachers and all that kind of thing.  But I, what most impressed me was that he was--he taught life all the time.  And I was very much interested in trying to figure it out because I was not happy with my lot on the farm.  And I was not happy with my father's [Narvie Hester Lassiter] status economically, you know, the return.  You work all year and then start the credit thing all over again.  You pay your debts down to the penny, work all year and then you didn't have enough money--I won't get too deep into it, enough money to run you the next year, and you got to start the credit thing all over.  I knew.  I felt something was wrong, I felt something was wrong with, and I couldn't understand it, and he taught--he would answer questions if you asked, about why is this?  Why does this have to be?  Why are we passing white schools to come here?   And why?  You know this kind of stuff.  And he would answer.  He would answer anything you asked him.  And I liked, and being in his office one on one, you could ask troubling questions.
Speaker 1: Were you aware of the movement going on in the civil rights field in those days?
Speaker 2: Not until 1954, the year I graduated.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and the "Brown v. Topeka" decision.  He called the Crown & Scepter Club together.  He didn't even bother to tell the whole school that segregation had been outlawed.  He called the Crown & Scepter Club together, I remember it very distinctly and told us the decision had been made and what it meant.  And I have to admit (laughter), we didn't take it seriously. (Laughter)  We got on bus--we told the other kids on the bus.  When we left Berry O'Kelly, we had to ride back to Apex Elementary School, change buses and go home.  On the bus back to Apex we told all the other kids.  We passed the white schools.  Your little black butts gonna be going to school up there at Miss Sally next year.  Ha ha, ha.
Speaker 1: You got kind of a silly idea.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had no idea how critical that decision was then.  Although he explained it, we didn't see it for what it was worth.  Nobody could appreciate the turmoil it would create because you kind of took it for granted if you make this advance, that's a step forward.  It's gonna to stay a step forward and then step forward a little more.  That's kind of how he explained it to us.  But of course, we took a step backwards (laughter), you know, the resistance and all of that.  We didn't anticipate that.  And that it would be all of those years before you got up to those schools. (Laughter)  It didn't happen.  But he explained it to us.  And that was my and then 'Ebony' magazine came out, and I remember reading it in detail as a high school senior, you can understand that kind of thing.  I read it in detail, the legal part of it, the drama of going in front of the [U.S. Supreme] Court.  And I could identify with what the lawyers must have gone through.  I didn't understand the law.  But I understood--what I really felt was they must have been scared to death to go up there and challenge that court like that.  But his speech and 'Ebony' magazine opened my eyes to that it was bigger than just something to talk about.  This is monumental.
Story_ID: 37434
Speaker 1: All right.  So when you're a senior in high school Berry O'Kelly [High School, Method, North Carolina] then how did--who made it possible for you to go to Tuskegee [University]?  How did you pin that down?
Speaker 2: Okay.  In Apex [North Carolina], my mother [Margie Ree Upchurch Lassiter] had a friend who had a son, one year older than I am.  Her son went to Tuskegee one year before I did.  At the time, I had no idea how I was going to go to college and I'm getting ready to graduate.  I'm a senior.  And my mother talked to his mother, and his mother explained to her how he got there.  And that's how I was introduced to Tuskegee's five year plan.  And I talked to his mother, and I talked to him when he came home.  And he told me how to get the paperwork and I sent for it, and applied.  But that senior year, or the junior year, my father [Narvie Hester Lassiter] bought that farm I talk about and moved the family to the farm, that moved me twenty miles away (laughter) from Apex.  But we, my brother [Willis Clarence Lassiter] and I, although he's two years older than I, we graduated together because he fell behind two years. So I caught up with him.  He had never learned to study.  I taught him how to study.  For the first time, he started enjoying school.  So we graduated together.  And, but we were living on my father's farm, twenty miles away from Apex.  In order to go to Berry O'Kelly and not go to the sorriest school system in North Carolina where our farm was located, my father said if you can get back to Berry O'Kelly you can go.  If it means I have to get up early, and do twice as much work, whatever, if I can get there, you finish up Berry O'Kelly rather than finish this poor school over here.  My brother and I would get up at 4:00 in the morning our senior year.  Walk four miles, catch that Apex bus 'cause it couldn't cross the Chat [Chatham]--County lines.  We had to walk our county end of it until we got to the bus line that went to Apex.  We walked four miles, got on that bus that went twenty miles to Apex School, changed buses and rode sixteen miles to Berry O'Kelly for a year (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Huh.
Speaker 2: --in order finish and get our degree from--get our diploma from Berry O'Kelly because Chatham County where our farm was, had the poorest system in the state.  And that would have been, if you wanna go to college, you cannot finish over there (laughter) and go to Tuskegee.  But that's how we got to finish Berry O'Kelly.  We had--and sometimes we would miss the bus.  We would see it turning around, 'cause it couldn't wait.  And we would walk four miles to a main highway that lead to Apex and we would catch anything smoking.  Sometimes we flagged down the state trooper, a couple of the teachers took that route from Durham [North Carolina] down to Apex.  We'd flag them down.  We would get there in time to catch that bus to Raleigh [North Carolina] one way or another to finish.  So that's a story in itself. Then we would reverse it in the afternoon.
Speaker 1: So it was before daylight.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Four o'clock in the morning.
Speaker 1: --and it happened all year round.
Speaker 2: Walking through the dark woods, and animals and everything.  I remember one time a screech owl which is a kind of hooting owl, screamed.  And we were walking through the dark (laughter) and both of us, his foot and mine's said swish.  You could hear it on the gravel.  He started to run, and I started to run.  But we both knew if you start running, and one you separate.  And two, you can't see, so we stopped.  But it really frightened us.  Most of the time we made it.  We talked and kept our spirits.  But that time, we almost lost it (laughter).  And it was dark.  It was scary.  It was cold, you know.

Speaker 1: So, your high school [Berry O'Kelly High School in Method, North Carolina] graduation.  This is in what year?
Speaker 2: 1954.
Speaker 1: Okay, the year of the 'Brown vs. the Board [of Education]' decision.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, were you--did you have any special honors at graduation?
Speaker 2: I was Salutatorian.  I qualified--I really had the grades for Valedictorian, but an incident occurred in chemistry that prevented me from being--one of the kids put zinc oxide in a beaker full of sulfuric chloride or something like that.  Anyway, it was making oxygen, and that's what we were supposed to been doing.  We were supposed to been using little beakers, tiny bit, and the chemistry who would then have a stick--a match to it, and it would poof, you know, this much.  But if you put a handful in a big beaker, you're filling the room up full of oxygen.  And one of those matches would have taken the side off that building.  So the instructor was livid when she found out, and opened the windows and all of that.  So she asked who did it.  And we wouldn't tell, just like kids today.  I think about it when we talk about kids--what's the term they use now, "Don't--
Speaker 1: Don't--I don't know.  I know what you mean.
Speaker 2: Yeah, squeal.  So we wouldn't tell.  And I knew who did it.  I'm not gonna mention his name.  He's a principal now, a retired principal (laughter).  So she punished us all, and that brought my grade down.  And I missed being Valedictorian because of that.  It didn't really bother me.  She eventually moved to Baltimore [Maryland].  She passed here, but I got to know her here after I'm out of grad [graduate] school and everything else.  And that was a tremendous reunion.  She was only four years older than I was because it was her first year teaching.  But at the time, she seemed, you know, she was an adult, and I was a kid.  But she was only four years older than I was.  And a wonderful lady.  Her best friend was the teacher who introduced me to journalism, who--that lady's--who introduced me to journalism is still alive.  My brother visits her in Durham [North Carolina] now.  She's very old.
Speaker 1: Can you give us their names?
Speaker 2: The journalism teacher's name was Suzie--it escapes me.
Speaker 1: Okay, I--
Speaker 2: And Barbara Council was the chemistry teacher's name.
Speaker 1: Barbara Council.
Speaker 2: Barbara Council, and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I can't think of Susan--Suzie's name.  But I wrote some columns about Wilbur Moore [principal of Berry O'Kelly High School], and his teaching and all of that, and I sent them to her.  And I never sent them to him, and he retired and lives in New Jersey, my brother tells me.  But I never sent him a copy of the columns.  That shows you, kind of the impact, what he said to us then, has followed me all my life.  And I gave him credit after I got into journalism.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 37436
Speaker 1: Now, Tuskegee [University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  So I take it you turned in your papers and you were able to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I sent off, applied, had no idea how I would get there.  And they send me the information on the five-year plan.  And the process, after you're accepted, was bring Tuskegee $150.00.  We enroll you into the five-year plan.  You work full-time three years, and go to school part time.  And then the second two--fourth and fifth year, you work part time and go to school full time.  And then you get your BS [bachelor of science degree].  So I didn't have a $150.00.  And my father [Narvie Hester Lassiter] didn't have $150.00.  And when school opened, it was too early to--my father gave one acre of the crops that year to my brother [Willis Clarence Lassiter] and I.  Whatever that acre made was to be ours.  This was the second time that he tried to give us a foot up in life.  The first time, we were high school.  He gave us a hundred dollars each, put it in the bank and said this is your start.  You'll never start where I started, and this is your start, took us to the black bank in Durham [North Carolina].  We put it in.  We met C.C. Spaulding.  He patted us on the back, and we took the money out.  We had an opportunity to take a trip to visit Washington, D.C. [District of Columbia].  We asked him could we take thirty dollars of it, make that trip.  And we did.  So his nest egg was broken.  So when he gave us this one acre of land together, that was his second attempt to give us a nest egg, a beginning.  But school would open before we would have sold any of that tobacco and had money.  So I didn't have the 150 [dollars].  It was in the ground.  It was harvested, but had, was not sold.  So I went to an uncle who had gone to A and T [University].  He was one of my role models in terms of "go to college."  My grandmother's brother had gone to A and T.  He was a role model, but I didn't wanna go to A and T.  I didn't wanna go to Shaw [University].  I went to a white store owner in my area and asked him to lend me the $150.00.  He said he didn't have it, and I don't think he did.  He was just scraping out a living.  You know, I know now.  I thought he had money.  He had a store.  You gotta have money, but I now realize, he didn't have any money.  (Laughter) But I couldn't raise the $150.00.  So my father interrupted the harvesting process to do what you call work up a load of tobacco and go sell it, couldn't sell it in Durham, had to go a long distance where the warehouses had opened already.  And he sold it, and that's how I got the $150.00.  It earned $150, but technically, $75.00 of it was my brother's, my older brother's.  So he said, no, take it all, go to school.  I'll get mine when we sell in.  You won't be here.  And that's how I got the $150.00 to enroll at Tuskegee.
Speaker 1: Was your brother intending to go too?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it was his money just the same (laughter), you know, his half.  But, and that's the kind of big brother he's always been.  So it wasn't a surprise that he would take that route.  But it took his actual acquiescence to do it.  You know, I couldn't just claim it.  He had to agree.  Some brothers would have said, oh, no, give me mine, you know, this kind of thing.  He wasn't like that at all.  So that's how I got the $150.00.  But that's all I had.
Story_ID: 37437
Speaker 1: We got the train ticket, and I got on the train.  I took it, 900 miles, almost a thousand miles to Tuskegee [Alabama] from Raleigh [North Carolina].  And one of the experiences that I remember--two.  One, my family was there, and I'd never been on a train.  And they said their good-byes.  And I walked away to get on the train, and I never looked back because I had read that when you--one of these philosophical things that I took too far, when you change directions, and you set a new sight, don't look back.  So I didn't look back.  Years later, I found out it broke my mother's [Margie Ree Upchurch Lassiter] heart.  She wanted me to look back and give me that last wave as I get on the--you know how mothers are, any parent.  I never looked back, and she cried and cried and hurt for years.  I didn't know.  But that was the reason.  I'd heard, when you change course, don't look back (laughter), so I didn't.  So I got on the train, and after thirty miles on the train, we went through Sanford [North Carolina].  That's where my grandparents on my mother's side had grown up, and I mean where she had kind of grown up.  The nearest town was Sanford.  And I realized, going to visit my grandparents in Sanford was the furthest I'd ever been from home.  That was the last sign I saw that I'd ever seen, recognized, knew anything about, thirty miles from home, going 900 miles.  It was the end of the world for me.  I had never--and it registered with me, what you're really doing, you know, and this kind of thing.  So I took the train ride to Tuskegee, and that's how I got there.  And no pocket change, arrived on Saturday, and school doesn't really crank up till Monday.  You can't register, you can't anything.  I had no way to eat for two days, no money, no anything.  But my friend who had been there one year before me, broke the rule and let me eat one meal on his meal ticket.  And that's how I--I wouldn't have starved, but I had, didn't have a dime.  Interesting that my wife had come from another town, same lack of preparation for (laughter) those two days.  So she starved for two days too.  But we didn't know each other (laughter).  But the 150 [dollars], on Monday, you gave--I gave it to the school and started the five-year plan.  And it was a hard experience, so I didn't go home for four years.  I never saw my family again for four years.  And that, when I went home for four years, it was just for overnight.  And I went back to Tuskegee [University] to finish that one year.  Then I went.  When I finished, I didn't have money to go home.  I had to borrow fifteen dollars to have enough to catch a bus to go home with my diploma.  So--
Speaker 2: So nobody from your family was able to come to see you graduate?
Speaker 1: No.  Her family--we had kind of gotten engaged by then.  Her mother was there.  No one from my family.
Story_ID: 37438
Speaker 1: In the whole time I was at Tuskegee [University, Tuskegee, Alabama], I got eleven dollars from home.  The first Christmas, I wrote home, and everybody was writing home or going home.  And I wrote home and said, it'd be nice if I had a few dollars for Christmas.  And my father [Narvie Hester Lassiter] didn't have it, which I should have remembered.  But I forgot, you know.  So I wrote and asked, and he sent me ten dollars, and that was it.  And then I had one aunt, one cousin, who sent me one dollar in a card in those five years.  And I still have it.  I have the card, and the dollar.  She's passed, but that's what it meant to me.  And she was a special cousin because in all of these thirteen children that my mother's [Margie Ree Upchurch Lassiter] mother had, they had children that I grew up with, cousins.  She was in an awkward age, and there were no girls.  So she played with the boys.  So, she was a special cousin to me.  I knew her, you know, I think she knew me.  So when I went off to college, she sent me a dollar (laughter).  And when I went home years and years later, looking forward to telling her how much it meant to me that she had done that, she had been in an automobile accident, and her mind was damaged.  She hardly knew me.  So I never got the chance to tell her like I'm telling you, but I still have it.  I can put my hand on the card and the dollar.  But in those five years, that's all I got from home.  So I had to work it.  At one point, I had five jobs, back-to-back.  I would do my Tuskegee regular job.  Then I had a job cleaning the faculty clubhouse, and drinking their sodas and playing their music.  Nobody came, nobody--two faculty members came to the clubhouse, two younger ones.  The older ones never came over, so I had the run of the place.  I studied, and I drank their sodas.  I watched Bill Russell play his first game on their television (laughter) and listened to Edward Griggs [ph.].  There was only one classic album in the building.  So I listened to it all--Pierre Gent suite over and over and over.  I love it.  And every time it plays, I can't resist telling her, that's Edward Griggs.  She says, you know so much about classic music.  [Whispering].  That's the only one I know (laughter).  But that was--and then I'd leave that job and I went to a shoe store and sold, supposedly sold shoes.  And then I would leave there and go to the Dean of Men's Office and work during the night in the Dean of Men's office, one summer--not every, but--
Speaker 2: Okay, now--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --that's how I got through it.  And the one student who went before me, from Apex [North Carolina], he was majoring in veterinary medicine, and he never finished.  He was brilliant--we were talking about Dr. Dibble, earlier, you and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right, Dr. Eugene Dibble, yeah.
Speaker 1: --who managed the hospital, one of his friends was a Dr. Ford who had a daughter.  And my friend became the boyfriend of Dr. Dibble--Dr. Ford's daughter, living the life, and had access to their home, had access to their car.  So he got off the five-year plan.  Then Dr. Ford moved to California.  And his last year there, he couldn't eat because you--once you get off the plan, you can't get back on it.  And he was real good in school, and I used to watch him--and I got to repay that favor where he let me eat on his card.  I let him eat on my card, which was illegal, but we did it.  And I used to watch him dissect those animals, eat crackers, soda crackers, white crackers.  That's all he had.  And eventually he just--and he would go down to the edge of the campus.  There were some plum bushes.  This is a true story.  He wasn't the only one eating those plums (laughter).  You know, a lot of five-year plan, you had to make it the best way you could.  And he would eat plums, eat those crackers, dissect those animals, and keep trying, but it was just too much.  So he never finished.
Speaker 2: Did he just leave school?
Speaker 1: He left school.  I think he was a junior.
Speaker 2: Did he go back home?
Speaker 1: Went back home, and then what exactly became of him, I don't know.  One of the reasons that's so significant to me is because that was my motivation to stay on the plan, to maximize the plan, don't get carried away with whatever might happen to you in this process.  This is your ticket out from the farm and poverty and all of this.  Act like it.
Story_ID: 37439
Speaker 1: So I tried to do the jobs well and eventually, the first job [at Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] was janitorial, cleaning the building I talked to you about, the Huntington Hall and polishing those banisters and that kind of--it was a good job, in the sense that I found a way to study on the job, you know.  I gave them--I did the work, but I would into the building--I'll make this short--I'd go into the building at four o'clock, clean it, sparkle and all of that, and I learned how to anticipate my supervisors checks, more than anticipate.  And I studied all day, and that's why my grades were good.  And I'll make this a real quick story.  The storage room for the janitor was, had an outer compartment and a huge metal door.  And he had to come through that door, take about eight steps, and then the storage room where I was studying, I took an old clock, took the cover off, tied a string to the alarm, hooked the string to the outer door, and wound the clock up.  When he would push the outer door, the alarm would go off.  I would hide it, and I would busy as all get out (laughter).  When he would come, I'd be folding clothes, washing 'em.  He never caught me.  I studied all day (laughter), kept the--you know, I had to go out and clean the halls and all of that.  And I made sure I did that.  When the students were changing classes, I made a point to be in the way.  Excuse me, they would say.  I'm busy.  They'd say, boy, this boy is ambitious, and he really does his job (laughter).  And soon as the class was over, I would go back downstairs and hit those books.  And that's--it wasn't brilliance that kept me at the top of the class.  It was study.
Speaker 2: Now, the five-year plan, as you were describing it before we started this session, consisted of full-time work, and part-time school for the first two years--
Speaker 1: Three years.
Speaker 2: Three years?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: And then full-time school and part-time work for the last two years?
Speaker 1: Two years.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And every aspect of the campus had students working.  Some of the jobs were fabulous, you know, secretary to the president, a student, in addition to an adult, professional--(simultaneous)--
Story_ID: 37440
Speaker 1: Now, the school [Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] is basically staffed by the students, right, and that was--
Speaker 2: Sub staff, second levels--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Booker T. Washington's plan--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That's his plan.
Speaker 1: --was to sustain the school with student labor.
Speaker 2: And if you kept your grades up, they were not gonna let you leave, if you--no good student would they let leave.  If you kept your grades up, and you ran into a financial problem, on the plan or off the plan, they would find that money.  It was a struggle, but they would keep you there.  And they would tell you that.  And, but a key part of the plan was if you came there poor, and most of the plan--all of plan students were poor, there was no loss of dignity associated with work.  Work at Tuskegee was noble, and that's what you read about Booker T. [Washington] all the time.  And the inculcated that throughout the campus.  You were respected just by being a work student.  One, they knew you had to be a valedictorian or a salutatorian pretty much to have been chosen to be on it.  Two, you had to have a desire.  Your intent was to maximize that school and the third part of Tuskegee's philosophy is they teach you to serve.  You get your education, to contribute something, not just to make money.  I'd be a lot richer if I'd gone to a different school and got the same training.  I'd have had a different philosophy.  And I would have had more money, but I would not be as happy.  But that service thing, they inculcate into you, and especially, since it's there, you're working, you do a good job.  If your supervisors can say good things about you, you're somebody at Tuskegee.  And then we held all of the positions, most of the positions of leadership on that campus, were five-year plan students.  And as plan students, you became a sub family within the Tuskegee family.  You worked together, you helped each other and this kind of thing.
Speaker 1: What would be the other categories of students?  They've got students on the five-year plan.  So I assume you have students that could pay the full tuition that they--
Speaker 2: And they were regular students, paid their way.  And they did college the way college is painted in the books, and, you know, you had the time for the courting and the playing around and postponing a class that got tough, you know, take it next year, and stay here five years 'cause you can afford it.  They got to play college like college.
Speaker 1: Fraternities and sororities.
Speaker 2: Fraternities, and this kind of--five-year plan students, we joined Greek organizations, but it was after you had gotten your grade level at a point where you could afford to lose a few points one semester and then you'd break your back to build it back up.  But you didn't--that wasn't first.  That class work, work, then you try to do the Greek thing because the payoff, you understood it like everybody else.  But you had an opportunity to--you got two educations.  You got the regular curriculum.  Then you got a life education, survival.  Well, let's call it that.  You got a survival education.
Story_ID: 37441
Speaker 1: Who were some of the major influences on you at Tuskegee [University, Tuskegee, Alabama] in terms of the--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: It could be faculty, staff or students?
Speaker 2: One faculty student, a Dr. Stanley Smith was the greatest academic influence.  He taught in the Social Science department.  He taught sociology, "Marriage and the Family" basic sociology and eventually left Tuskegee and became president of Shaw University in Raleigh, North Carolina.  But he was the instructor who took me to a new level in terms of what study and education was all about.  And two influences.  One was my first male teacher in junior high school, a Mr. Yokely (ph.), and I won't go backwards too far.  But he came and we were learning mathematics by saying two and two are four, four and four are eight.  And we would literally say it, and if you did a long column, we would say--say, you were seven, six and five.  Seven and six is whatever that is, plus, so and so, is whatever that is.  Mr. Yokely said, oh, no.  I'm gonna hit this yardstick, and you tell me the next seven, thirteen, nineteen.  Do it up here [pointing to head] like this.  That taught me a whole--moved me to a whole new level of math study.  Well, Mr.--Professor Smith did the same kind of thing in terms of human dynamics.  When he taught "Marriage and the Family," he made us understand why families break up, why men were beginning to have a hard time because they were no longer running the farm and they were the boss.  And see, I came along at the time when that was just starting.  And he explained what was happening.  He explained what was behind, not only why blacks were beginning to push so hard, you know, the Civil Rights Movement, sociologically and psychologically, he explained why whites were resisting so hard, you know, morays and values and just totally changed my appreciation of why I was there studying for because then he--it helped me to understand physical science, you know, why an airplane flies.  I would have gone to physical science and came out being able to tell you why an airplane stays up there (unclear).  But once I understood that there's a law and some theories behind everything, physical and sociologically, that's when my education really--.
Story_ID: 37442
Speaker 1: Now, you graduated from Tuskegee [University, Tuskegee, Alabama] in 1959?
Speaker 2: 1959.
Speaker 1: '59 [1959] and--
Speaker 2: Went in 1954.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and when you graduated, you taught school at, on the campus, right?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?  Okay.
Speaker 2: No, when I left Tuskegee, I went home [North Carolina] for the first time to stay, and I stayed that summer.  And I worked as a janitor at a hospital in Durham [North Carolina], and I applied to Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts] because Tuskegee gave me the biggest scholarship they had, the James Foundation Grant, $1,000.00.  I wanted to go to grad [graduate] school to get journalism because I couldn't get it at Tuskegee.  So I took secondary, a secondary ed. [education] degree, and sociology, history and all that, the social sciences, preparatory to going into journalism.
