Story_ID: 89205
Speaker 1: All right, now before we go into depth, there are five "People" magazine-ish type questions that we ask, and they only require a brief answer.  The first one is, sir, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food is French cuisine and I would say coq au vin, chicken and wine, so that's what I, I, I would, I would, I would say.  I like everything, and I'll tell you the truth, I eat--I've been to the most fabulous restaurants in the world, and I'll eat just about anything, except when in, in '99 [1999], I went with Mayor [Kurt L.] Schmoke [HM]'s, Schmoke's delegation to China and Japan.  And in Hong Kong they served us goose feet, which I nibbled on, but I put back, so that's not my favorite.  But I'll eat just about anything.  You can tell that from the weight that I've put on.
Speaker 1: Coq au vin is your favorite?
Speaker 2: I like coq au vin, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: I like blue.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Favorite time of the year.  Well, let's see, the spring or the fall, and oh, I guess September might be.
Speaker 1: Okay, now do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I guess I enjoy going back to Paris [France] when I go out.  I used to go almost every summer to Paris, so Paris is I guess my favorite destination.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you, sir, have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: A favorite phrase or saying, I, I just have so many of them.  Let's see, one in French is Le temps c'est de l'argent (time is money), that's one.  Let's see, right now I can't think of one off hand, but--time is money--let's see--my memory is kind of disappearing (unclear)--
Speaker 1: It'll probably come out in the course of the interview.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 89206
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about your family history.  How far back can you trace your family?  How far back do you go?
Speaker 2: On my mother [Gladys Means McIntyre Moore]'s side I can go back to my grandparents.  My, my grandfather was Louis Means, and his wife was Rebecca Means.  I knew them fairly well.  I didn't know any of my great-grandfathers--great--grandmothers.  I know practically nothing about my father [Sandy John McIntyre]'s side, practically nothing.  I met an adopted sister of his, supposedly, at (unclear) in Chicago [Illinois].  But I found that I'd never met any of his family I didn't know, so I really don't know anything about his side.  I don't even know exactly where he was born.  I know I think I he was born in Louisiana, but I'm not sure, I'm not too sure.  But I, I, I grew up knowing my mother's parents fairly well 'cause we would go there and spend a lot of time there at their home in Pine Bluff [Arkansas].
Speaker 1: Okay, were there, there, there any stories about slavery or-
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: I was asking of there were any stories about slavery or reconstruction or what life, or early life, you know, in your family that, that they passed down, the stories, songs, or any--
Speaker 2: I know of none.  I, I know I was, I was told that the grandfather of my--well, my great-grandfather was a slave, but I knew nothing of him.  They never discussed this with me.  I never knew anything about that at all.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Any interesting thing about the history of the region there, Pine, Pine Bluff--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I, I know very little about Pine Bluff, except I was there to an age about five or six.  And of course, I don't recall very much about this particular period.  So I don't, I don't anything about that region particularly, except that we would visit in, during the summer months occasionally my grandparents in Pine Bluff, a lovely big white house and, and it accommodate two or three different families, you know, but that's about all I remember.  I enjoyed being with my grandfather.  I enjoyed playing checkers with him, who was expert at checkers.  And I would occasionally beat him, and that was a thrill 'cause he was supposed to be unbeatable, you know.  And my grandmother was extremely religious and thought this was the work of the devil, checkers and chess, so that she didn't particularly approve of the playing of checkers and all.  But he was adept at it, and I enjoyed playing with him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had--my mother had three brothers.  There were seven kids in all.
Story_ID: 89207
Speaker 1: What was your mother's full name, and can you spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Gladys, G-L-A-D-Y-S, Means, M-E-A-N-S, McIntyre Moore, because she married my father, McIntyre, and then she, eventually after his death, married a Mr. Moore, M-O-O-R-E, so it's Gladys Means, M-E-A-N-S, McIntyre Moore.
Speaker 1: Now what is her birth date and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born--let's see--April the 24th, 1900.  She died in, in '94 [1994].  At the age of 93, she died in, in 1994.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now you were saying that she had brothers and sisters, right?
Speaker 2: She had, yeah, there were seven of them.  Let's see, that was Emery, Bourbon (ph.), Eurin (ph.), James, and then my mother, and Mildred, and Uncle James.  Uncle James, by the way, got--I think was the first--I understand he was the black to get a Ph.D. from the University of Oklahoma, mathematics and physics.  He's still alive.  Aunt Versa (ph.), my favorite aunt, is still alive.  The rest of them are dead.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Aunt Versa lives in East St. Louis [Illinois].  She taught French and Spanish in St. Louis.  She taught also at Morris Brown College [Atlanta, Georgia] and several other colleges, and then she ended up teaching--marrying a principal in East St. Louis, and she's lived there ever since.  But those are, those are the members of her family.
Speaker 1: Now, so would you say that you come from, on, on her side of the family, of teachers and educators basically?
Speaker 2: Well, my, my grandfather was a teacher.  And he became a postman afterwards when he--'cause he made much more money, and so he left the teaching field and became a postman.  Her, one of her brothers was a teacher and principal.  My Uncle James is--was head of the Department of Physics and Mathematics I think at Houston (unclear), if I'm not mistake, Vern (unclear).  He's 90-something now, so I'm sure he's retired.  I don't keep in touch with him.  My mother was a teacher and so was my father, before he became a minister.  And I understand that my--I don't know the background of my, my grandmother, but my, one of my cousins said that she taught, but I didn't know anything about that.  I'm not too sure about that part.
Speaker 1: All right, well, tell me something about your mother.  What was she like and--
Speaker 2: My, my mother was a, as I say, was a teacher.  I think she taught, if I'm not mistaken, the first grade.  And then after she married my father and then we started moving, she didn't teach.  She was just a housewife, very energetic, very religious woman.  I think for about almost forty years she was about to--she was the president of the National Women's League of her church, so she traveled lecturing.  And in fact, her church named a dormitory after her.  But she was, she was a very, very strong wrong woman, extremely strong.  And even though my father was a titular head of the family, one can almost feel the strength of the mother, you know, and, and determining what we did and did not do.
Speaker 1: What was the name of her church?
Speaker 2: Church?  She, she was a member of the Church of Christ Holiness, that was her church.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that's a very strict church apparently--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, very strict.  I think the (unclear)--it was of origin was something like Baptist in the beginning, and then they, they, they developed a program all their own.  And my father eventually became a minister in that church, and that's where we went around, after leaving Arkansas, with him to the various, various churches mentioned later on.
Story_ID: 89208
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so well, tell us about your father.  What was his full name, and what, what, what was his date and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His name was Sandy McIntyre.  He was born September the 18th, the same day that I, in 1899.  He died at the age of 41 or 42.  I think that we're not too sure, but '40 [1940] or 4--I think he died in, in September of '40 or '41 [1941].  I'm not too sure of that.  We, our family, will disagree on the dates.  Some same '4--I thought it was '40 [1940].  My sisters thought it was '41 [1941], so I'm not too sure, but a very brilliant man, a person whom I adored, a person who, who believed in education.  He taught for a while, before he became a minister.  But amazingly enough, he would read by turning a page, turning a page, turn a page.  We'd stop him.  We'd say okay, what was on that page?  And he would almost tell you in photographic fashion what he saw, what he had just done, brilliant man, a man I admired very much.  He was not one for tremendous praising.  All the honors that I got in high school and all, he would occasionally say "very well done. I'm proud of you," but that's it, you know.  And I would expect all kinds of accolades, you know, and adulation.  My mother [Gladys Means McIntyre Moore] would do it, but--quite often.  He didn't believe in praising too much.  I think he thought it might cause my ego to rise, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, now were you named after your father?  He spells his name slightly different--
Speaker 2: It, it's slightly different, and e--eventually, my father said that my name should be with an "e" on the end and Jean.  And that--he was--I was told that an early age, and so he eventually changed my name to Sandye Jean McIntyre, II, 'cause it was not--
Speaker 1: He spelled his J--his John's a--
Speaker 2: D-Y.
Speaker 1: --J-O-H-N.
Speaker 2: John, yeah, then he changed it Jean.
Speaker 1: And he didn't, he didn't have an "e" on the end of the Sandy?
Speaker 2: No, he didn't have an "e" on there, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it was a--okay.
Speaker 2: This was the decision that he told me.  He said this is what your name should be.  And you didn't argue with my father generally, you know; you, you accepted more or less what he said--
Story_ID: 89209
Speaker 1: Now did, did you suspect or did he ever mention having a French background?
Speaker 2: Yes, but it's something I don't really like to discuss too much, because I don't have no proof of any of this.  And I had a feeling that there was something French involved in my father's past, and--but he would never, ever discuss it.  His best friend was a Emile Blais De Sauze, who is my godfather, who is the, as I said to you before, the head of the Department of Foreign Language of [Case] Western Reserve University in Cleveland [Ohio] and also the head of the, the superintendent--the head of foreign language studies in, in Cleveland public schools.  And in fact, he's the first one to inaugurate the so-called "Cleveland Plan", a multiple approach system where no English was allowed.  Here at Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland] I have never used any English.  I don't allow a single word of English in my class, not from the very first day do I allow a word of English, nor does my colleague, Dr. [Carleen] Leggett, whom we met.  We, we grew up on the idea that you learn the language by using the language itself.  Now, my students can never, ever use the language.  I may translate a statement that I've made that I may consider a little difficult, but I don't ever--I've never taught in my 55 years of teaching, I've never, ever explained a point of grammar in English.  Everything has been in French.  And I've gotten a few accolades, a few re--awards for the system, and I've tried to introduce it.  My students basically have followed the same kind of system of you, you--not allowing any use of English in the language, language.  And when I travel and lecture--I've done this, of course, in Thailand, and, and I received a, well, some recognition for having insisted in Thailand they're not using Thai in the classroom, were using this foreign language, whether it be Spanish, or Japanese, or whatever.  And they thought this was brilliant, you know.  It was just the ideas that if you are forced to use the language, you use it, and you use it in authentic and automatic fashion.  And I've always done this.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your, your father was best friends with a, with a French--(unclear), you know--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, he, he, he, he was French.  He, he was French, yeah.  Emile Blais De Sauze, who was very well known if you're in, in the foreign language program, he was the innovator in 1919 on, on the so-called multiple approach system, where you, you insist upon--where you cater to, to all the basic skills.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so, but your father has kind of a mysterious past in terms of--I mean not, you know--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: There, there are things about my father that I would love to know.  And in fact, I have, I have just begun to make inquiries to see if more people know things about him, but I, I have so far, I have not reached a, a, a final point of recognition of some of the things that he's done, a very brilliant man.  He had a doctorates in I'm not quite too certain in what, but very brilliant man.  But--
Speaker 1: Did you know where he got his doctorate?
Speaker 2: No, I, I really don't, I don't, I don't really know, I don't know.  So much about my father--my father was not very revealing, a charming, but he was a charmer.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: Everyone adored him, but he didn't reveal very much about himself.
Story_ID: 89210
Speaker 1: All right, well, can, can you reflect back on growing up, I guess, both in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, and in Cleveland [Ohio].  Now you were briefly in Kentucky you said?
Speaker 2: I was there for--after leaving at the age of five or so--I think I was in the first grade in, in Arkansas--then we went to Kentucky for a year or so, and then to Omaha, Nebraska, for a year, and then to Cleveland.  And I, I recall very little of my Arkansas period except that I enjoyed occasionally being with my Aunt Versa (ph.), who would take me downtown.  And the people would think that that was her child, and she would never tell anyone that it wasn't.  I was a very attractive little boy, and I was, I was pretty smart too because I was reading at the age of almost two years, just, just before two years I was reading.  And I was always rather gifted in school.  I skipped the second grade, and I skipped the fifth grade.  I did very, very well as a kid, but I, I would read almost--I had a habit of reading two books a day, even as a kid.  And all the little--they used to give prizes at the library for the number of books, and I would always win, you know, because I, I did a tremendous amount--I loved to read.  And of course, this helped my imagination, and I was a very imaginative kid.  I would find myself occasionally getting in the closet.  And there was a--closed the closet, and there was a keyhole, and there was a, a drycleaners establishment next to my house.  And the vapors would come out, and I could see the vapors coming through the keyhole.  And they were projected on the wall, and I would imagine that I was the, a little superman.  I had, oh, I called myself the head of the 21, and I was the head of 20, and we'd go around the world righting wrongs.  I was very imaginative.  I was very fond of Zane Gray.  Fairytales encouraged my imagination.  But I did, I read, I had read by the age of eight or nine all of [Charles] Dickens.  And I, I did a tremendous amount of reading.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, that, it sounds like you're the, almost 19th century approach to reading--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --did, I did tremendous amount of reading.  I played tennis too.  That was--I, I did a lot of playing of tennis during my life, and that is the reason why I have problems with knees now and my hips.  I was Baltimore Tennis, Tennis Club champion, I guess, for about five, six years, 1962 to '67 [1967], something like that, and played singles and doubles.  And I played in Mexico, in Canada.  I won tournaments in France, played Arthur Ashe.  He was a good frat brother of mine, and whom I always respected and admired, one of the persons I've admired the most.
Story_ID: 89211
Speaker 1: Let, let me go back to growing up, and can, can you describe some of the sights, and sounds, and smells of growing up, things that you remember that made an impression on you?
Speaker 2: Oh, I recall the--my mother [Gladys Means McIntyre Moore]'s cooking.  She's an excellent cook.  And I could recall going in the kitchen and smelling that Sunday chicken.  That, that comes to my mind.  It's one of the--I always was close to nature 'cause I was play outside, and the smell of fresh grass cutting.  I'd do all the cutting of the lawn.  My father [Sandy McIntyre] was extremely strict.  He didn't want me washing dishes.  He felt that a, a man should be doing men--a man's thing.  And I would--my job was at 5:00 in the morning to stoke the coal in the furnace, keep--make certain that the furnace (unclear) stoked at night.  And all of the snow I would remove, and I'd cut the grass, but for some peculiar reason he didn't want me to stay in the kitchen.  So just right now I can't cook (laughter) except put--use a, a TV meal and put it in the microwave.  I can do that, but--
Story_ID: 89212
Speaker 1: Do, do you have any brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: I had no brothers.  I have two sisters.  I have one who's in, in, in Cleveland [Ohio] now.  Her name is Eloise Lesane, L-E-S-A-N-E.  And I have one in Chicago [Illinois], Dymple, D-Y-M-P-L-E, real weird names.  But my sister in Cleveland is now, let's see, she's two years old--she's 80--she'll be eighty-two this year.  And my sister in Chicago is two years younger, so she will be seventy-eight in July, yeah, but very charming sisters.  I had no brothers, and I always wanted a brother.  And I would adopt occasionally some male as my brother, but had charming sisters, and we're on the very best of relations now.  We call each other often and talk to them.
Story_ID: 89213
Speaker 1: Now, now why did the family move from Arkansas to--
Speaker 2: Well, my father [Sandy McIntyre] because a minister.  He left the teaching profession and became a minister.  And he, he was the minister of a church in Kentucky and then in Omaha [Nebraska] and then in Cleveland [Ohio].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well, what are your memories of Cleveland?  Was Cleveland radically different from, you know, what you were used to?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  I, I--Cleveland was considered one of the two most liberal cities in the country, along with San Francisco [California].  And I, I enjoyed Cleveland; I liked it.  I went to Central High School there, which is, which is the oldest school, high school, west of the Allegheny Mountains, where I, I excelled.  I had straight A's.  And it, it was a school of the Rockefellers.  I think Langston Hughes may have gone there once.  And I, I, I enjoyed it.  I had fabulous teachers.  Especially the one I recall perhaps the most often is my Latin teacher.  I had five years of Latin.  And she wrote the book for the Lat--for all of Cleveland's schools, and that was [Helen M.] Chesnutt.  She was the daughter of the poet Chesnutt.
Speaker 1: Charles [Waddell] Chessnutt.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, what was her, what was first name?
Speaker 2: Right now I can't remember (laughter) it.
Speaker 1: Ms. Chesnutt.
Speaker 2: Mrs. Chessnutt, yeah.  And I also recall, and I can't think of her name, the name of my tenth grade English teacher who was a German, and we thought she was a Nazi.  But she knew English from a theoretical point of view and, and insisted upon a recognition of parts of speech in their relationship to other parts of speech.  And she's the one who drilled me in, in--for--I won several spelling championships citywide, citywide, schoolwide and citywide, and she's the one who drilled me in this.  And really, I, I, I've always admired her along with another teacher in Omaha [Nebraska] whose name I recall vividly, and that's Ms. Gitter (ph.).  And she was the one who, who, because I loved literature so much, who encouraged me to continue to read.  And I think I had a little crush on her too.  But those are memories of teachers.  And I, you know, I--it's right now at this stage of my life it's very difficult to come up with specific facts and dates and all, but those people stand out in my, in my mind.  My--I had a good, excellent French teacher too whose name I've forgotten.
Speaker 1: Now, now where did you go to grade school--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I, I, I went to grade school--
Speaker 1: --started in Pine Bluff [Arkansas], right?
Speaker 2: I started in Pine (unclear) the first year.  Then I skipped and went to Madison I think I--a year or so in, in Kentucky and then a year in, in Omaha, and then the other was done in Cleveland, a public school there, and then I went to junior high, Central High was both junior high and senior high.
Speaker 1: Okay, but your name of your grade school (unclear)--
Speaker 2: You know, I, I, I, I don't, I don't remember.
Speaker 1: But it was a--what was it, a segregated school?
Speaker 2: No, it, it, you know, Cleveland was not segregated.
Speaker 1: No, Pine Bluff in grade school.
Speaker 2: Pine, Pine Bluff was segregated for us, and Madison, Kentucky, Madisonville, Kentucky, was segregated.  Omaha was not, of course; in, in fact, I was one of the few blacks there, and they, they skipped me too.  But--
Speaker 1: Okay, well, well, when you were in high school, now you were a gifted student apparently.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Were you involved in other high school activities?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, I was, I was in--I, I helped--let's see, what did I help do?  I helped run the, the movies, and I was in theater club.  And when any--I was the, elected the most outstanding student there.  So when a celebrity would come, I would generally present them, such as Langston Hughes when he came, Josephine Baker.  And in fact, I knew Josephine Baker very well, and when in France, I got to chat with her and talk with her.  And then I even, just before she died I'd gone to Norway.  Well, no, I was in, no I was Tivoli [Gardens] at Copenhagen [Denmark].  She was at Tivoli, and we spent the day together, eating.  Personally, I admired her very much.
Story_ID: 90697
Speaker 1: Okay, Sir, I want to go back to Langston Hughes.  What was Langston Hughes like?  You know, did you--
Speaker 2: You know, I only met him a student and met him several other times in formal places.  I didn't really know him, but we spoke French, and of course, he know, he knew French and he knew Spanish.  And I was very impressed by Langston Hughes, of course, but I didn't know him personally.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I thought I'd ask, you know.  And later on we'll talk about Josephine Baker.  But your impression of her in high school was--I guess you knew she was an international star?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.  She, she was--at that time, I guess I must have had a little crush on her too, just as most young men did at that time, you know, but--
Speaker 1: Now this is in the '40s [1940s] when you met her--
Speaker 2: But I knew, in, in, in the '30s [1930s].
Speaker 1: Thirties [1930s], okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I, I finished high school in January of 1940.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, she--
Speaker 1: That's before the war.  That's before she became a war hero, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: She was--she got the, the Scroix (ph.) de guerre.
Speaker 2: Croix de Guerre.
Speaker 1: Croix de Guerre, yeah.
Story_ID: 90698
Speaker 1: Yeah. Okay, well, tell us about--now, now when you were on the verge of graduating from high school, you said you were, you were one of the top students, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, there were four of us that had had straight "A" averages, and so they picked some--picked one to, to be that then.  We were all considered the, like valedictorian as such.  The--I, I, I finished (unclear)--they thought I was too young to go to college, so I took a post-graduate course in high school and took French, Latin, and typing, which has really saved me, made, made my [U.S.] Army career, typing.  And I recall vividly starting off.  There were about fifty of us in the class.  And I started off as not--as the last person in the class, number fifty.  And after each exam you'd move up.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And I ended number one that class.  So I learned to type 110 words a minute, you know, in that one semester.  And I think a lot of my (unclear) (unclear) to write my plays and other things from typing.  And typing did as much for me as perhaps any other course I've ever had.  Then I took, because I was very poor, I took chef.  And, and I was--and in fact, when they had the Parent Teachers Association [PTA] I was chosen as the number one chef, had--I couldn't cook a thing (laughter), but I had my little hat on and everything, but I enjoyed that.  Then I went to, I went to Johnson C. Smith [University, Charlotte, North Carolina].
Story_ID: 90699
Speaker 1: Now okay, so you went to Johnson C. Smith [University, Charlotte, North Carolina] before the [U.S.] Army?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I went, I went to the Army at the end of my junior year at Johnson C. Smith.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, Johnson C. Smith, now how did you choose Johnson C. Smith?
Speaker 2: Well, John--I wanted to go.  I had gotten, being the godson of [Emile Blais] De Sauze, I received a lot of offers, Ohio State University [Columbus, Ohio], Oberlin [College, Oberlin, Ohio], full scholarship.  But I wanted to go to a black school.  And at that time, I was beginning to feel some of my African heritage, so I went to a black school.  And there was a professor there, Monsieur Adam, who was Haitian.  And I had heard of him and had gotten in touch with him, so I decided to go there, got a scholarship there.
Story_ID: 90700
Speaker 1: How do you spell his name?
Speaker 2: A-D-A-M, Adam, Monsieur Adam, Jean Adam, who was my professor.  I had in [Johnson C.] Smith [University, Charlotte, North Carolina] three majors and three minors.  I took 27, 28 credits just about the entire time I was there.  The--I considered myself a premed student.  I also had a, a major in philosophy and one in French.  And French I took because all my life I'd been speaking, all my life I was speaking French, not all my life.  My godfather [Emile Blais De Sauze] had a radio program on Saturdays.  Quite often I would be his student.  And even before I took any courses of French in, in school, on Saturday mornings he would--I would be his pupil.  And--
Speaker 1: His radio pupil.
Speaker 2: Radio pupil.  And I did this for a long time.  And so I, I spoke fluent, fluent French, even when I was in high school, and I won the medal, the Latin medal and the French medal.  And so I took French as a major, major just because it was something easy and I enjoyed it.  But he [Monsieur Jean Adam] was very charming.  He had [Ordes] des Palmes Academiques, the, the highest award ever given to a French professor.  I was made a knight, and then I was made an officer in des Palmes academiques.  He was a knight, and he--I'll, I'll never forget this ribbon that he used to wear.  And he was very proud of it, and it's rarely given to foreigners.  And he, of course, being Haitian, received it.  I think he studied in France too.  But I, I decided this is the place for me to go (unclear).  So I thought that I was going to be either a psychiatrist or a surgeon.
Story_ID: 90701
Speaker 1: Then I was drafted.  I was drafted in 19--let me see, I was drafted in 1943.  And I went to, to basic training--very interesting.  I went to Fort Hayes [Columbus, Ohio] first, and there I took an AGCT.  And I think they said it was the highest that, that they'd ever seen AGCT.  Then they sent me to Fort Benning [Georgia], where I think I had one of the highest A--AG--American--I don't know what--what is AGCT--the General Classification Test, the Army General Classification, AGCT.  I had one of the highest ones there.  And, and I was put in ASTP, the Army Specialized Training Program.  The program, I think they had almost--I guess, I would say they had five hundred whites, and there were five blacks that were chosen, five or six, and we were all segregated.  This was a very segregating experience for me.  Now, I had encountered segregation before, having spent part of my youth in Arkansas and Kentucky.  But this was, no this was institutionalized segregation because we were, we were--we weren't allowed to go to the PX [Post Exchange], where, where you couldn't go to the barbershop.  They made us eat in a, in, in a cafeteria--not in a cafeteria.  We, we didn't call it a cafeteria.  We called it the--
Speaker 2: The mess?
Speaker 1: Mess hall, in, at a, a special table, and we were placed in the dormitory, in the very back of the dormitory.  And we had a rough time of it.
Speaker 2: And that was different from Cleveland [Ohio], right?
Speaker 1: Oh, of course, of course it was.
Speaker 2: Cleveland was a liberal city.
Speaker 1: Oh, very liberal.  This was very, this was a very--and most the non-coms [non-commissioned officers] were Southern and kind of vicious.  But their job, of course, was to train you, and so they were very rough on us, very, very rough.  And then, too, they thought we were, all of us, or the five or six, were, were either juniors or seniors in college.  And that's we were chose, why they chose you for the Army Specialized Training Program.  And they, they kind of resented the fact that we were college boys, and they were kind of rough on us.  But I got a lot of discipline out of this.  I learned, my three years in the [U.S.] Army, I learned a tremendous amount of discipline.  I've always been a kind of disciplined person for working and doing what I had to do at a specified time with specified resources.  But in the Army you learn to do things the way they want you to do it.  And they occasionally accept your opinion, but not too often.  And I got along very well in the Army.  I went, went to England first, and then we went to Belgium.  And the Germans were still in France.  I occasionally made a sortie in France when I--did I--when did I go take--I, I, I was in--I had a brief stint in the Intelligence Corps.  I went to intelligence school and had a brief stint working with black market, but that was in Belgium they sent me to school.  And then occasionally they would send me into France as a Moroccan.  But--
Speaker 2: As a Moroccan?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yeah, but it's--
Speaker 2: So, so your job was to go in and basically (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: --information as a Moroccan?
Speaker 1: I had--well, I was--let's see now.  So much of this I'm not supposed to even reveal.  But--
Speaker 2: Well, it's 19--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yeah, I'm just--
Speaker 2: --it's 2003.
Speaker 1: I, I know, but we made a pledge.
Story_ID: 90702
Speaker 1: But anyway, I, I, I did pick up a little bit of information here and there, but it didn't last too long.  And then I went to--I just--oh, how I got there, when I went in the [U.S.] Army, after leaving Fort Benning [Georgia], the (unclear)--(unclear) Breckenridge, and, and since I was a premed student, they put me in charge of an infirmary.  So I was in--I even had--I did a few operations and things.  And the, the, the head major, he was a guy I just really liked, he's, he became the medical--the coroner for cow--Cook County, you know, in Chicago [Illinois]; he, he, he, he became the coroner, but he was a major there.  And, and he'd been around blacks a lot, and he, he would talk jive talk, you know.  He's a Jew, but charming.  I visited him after the war.  I was, I was crazy about him.  But I, I, I was in charge of that group.  Well, one of the companies that came there was a quarter master company that--and the officer--the, the command--the first sergeant there, he and I became very good friends.  And he invited me to come to his company as his major clerk, and they'd give me a raise to--from corporal to, to sergeant so I accepted it.  And then one of the reasons I wanted to go there because my company, which is the chemical company, was going to be shipped to South Pacific, and I wanted to go to Europe.  So, since they were going to be shipped to Europe, I, I joined that company.  I eventually became, I was sergeant, chief clerk, and then I was sent to Antwerp, Belgium where I became the--they made me a first sergeant.  And just--let's see, what time did I go?  Let's see--anyway, I got, I get the, the intervals mixed up real good.  But I became first sergeant there, and then I was sent to France to head a company.  Each time I reorganized 'cause that's one of my things.  I, I would reorganize all the files and everything and got a lot of awards for that.  Then, let's see, I--let's see, I stayed there.  We--this, this company they wanted me to really work with because they had a lot of people from the stockades, prisoners, Army prisoners who had, had left the stockade and come there.  And they wanted me to see what I could do with this.  And I never will forget, one of the first days I got there I called (unclear).  And this--they said this guy was--he refuses to leave; he's not gonna leave this building.  I went over to his, to his room, up to the, to the barracks, and I said let's go soldier.  He pulled out a .45, had it at my head.  He said you gon' make me go?  So we had a little talk, and I explained to him, you know, that he could do one or two things: he could shoot me and be hanged, or he could join the company and, and enjoy the privileges of the company, you know.  I talked him into it, and he became one of my very good friends afterwards, you know.  This was a rough group of people I had to deal with, but I did very well with that.  Then after this time, I was sent to, to a school in Paris [France].  And there I was asked to act as a administrative assistant to the inspector general of the U.S. Army.  I accepted that position and went with him all ov--over the world.  And I've been trying to think of his name and all, but I, I think it slips me now.  I think it's Lee, but I'm-General Lee--but anyway, I worked with him, went with him all over the world traveling to various bases.  And I, I also was given then a, a, a direct commission for--and it lasted only about three or four months because they wanted me to make a career of the Army, which I did not want to do 'cause I wanted to go back and finish my senior year.  So they allowed me to go back and take--put my stripes on, so I became a first sergeant again, and I was discharged.  So I lasted in the Army from '43 [1943] to '46 [1946].
Story_ID: 90703
Speaker 1: When I left the Army in '46 [1946]--by the way, during the summer months, I would always work.  I worked--I never will forget the first time in my life I really worked.  In 1940 I--was it '41 [1941]?  Anyway, I worked in a bedspring factory where I had to put the coils together on the bedsprings.  And at the end of eight days, eight hours a day for five days, I got a check for eleven dollars.  I got eleven dollars for that whole week's work, and that's what I got generally, eleven or twelve dollars for the entire time, but that was in 1941 so, you know.  I, I recall when you could buy a coke and a donut for five dollars--I mean for five cents.
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) you know.
Speaker 2: Now it's five dollars.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I recall, you know, things have changed.  I remember gas used to be 29 cents.  You, you can't, you don't remember the 29 cents for gasoline.  But my, my father [Sandy McIntyre] died in 1941, and he had left me this 1936 Chevrolet.  And this is--it is an old Chevrolet, and the running--had a running board.  And we had covered up--we put a piece of--where the running board had fallen off, we had put a piece of lumber and put some rubber over the top of it.  And I used that car to get to Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland].  And I never will forget the trip coming from Cleveland [Ohio].  It took me two days to go from Cleveland to Baltimore, two days, and I could go no faster than 35 miles an hour.  There was no turn--turnpike so I had to go through Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], up and down the hills.  And (unclear) off at the top of the hill, the hot car would heat, so I stopped, let it cool off (laughter) and then go back down.  It took me two days to get here.  I arrived here at about one--twelve or one o'clock in the morning and went to two or three of the hotels downtown, which would not let me come in.  I, I, I--for some peculiar reason I should have known better.  You know, they always said that Baltimore was east and not south, so I went around and couldn't find the places.  The only place I could go was on Pennsylvania Avenue was a, a hotel for hookers, for prostitutes.  And I spent my first night here in a hotel for prostitutes on Pennsylvania Avenue.  The next morning when I went to Morgan, I went to see the president, Dr. [Martin D.] Jenkins, who had followed my career.  He'd--I, I was one of--part of--he had made a doctoral study on bright Negro youngsters, and he'd followed my career all the way through.  And that's one of the reasons I came to Morgan, because of Dr. Jenkins.  But--and I'd said--I had had, as the godson of [Emile Blais] De Sauze, I had about twenty-five offers and had the straight "A" average and all, so.  I'd said, told him, I said I, I really think that I should be--I should not stay here, and thanks so much for the offer.  One of the other reasons, too, is that the other school, like Ohio State University [Columbus, Ohio] and University of Connecticut [Mansfield, Connecticut] offered me some, somewhere between $2,500, $2,600, $2,700, and Morgan had offered me $3,000.  So that was an incentive too at that day.  Three thousand dollars in 1948 was a lot of money, you know, at that time.  But he, he, he encouraged me to stay.  And that's perhaps one of the best decision I ever made, 'cause that--this is fifty-five years.
Story_ID: 90704
Speaker 1: Okay. So, well, how did you find Morgan State [University, Baltimore, Maryland]?  Well, well, I guess you liked it because you've been here fifty-five years (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, I like--I, I've enjoyed Morgan.  I've enjoyed working with the presidents.  I've been something of an advisor quite often to most of the presidents over here.  Dr. [Martin D.] Jenkins has called me in quite often after faculty meetings where things were very rough, and the faculty members were sometimes not too polite.  And he'd call me up 'cause I was a generally in my office till very late in the morning.  He'd call me up and say what do you think of those?  And I'd say no do you want the truth, or do you want me to flatter you?  He says flatter me first, so I'd flatter him.  Then he--I said well, you, you didn't show much tact, Mr. President.  And--but we got along very, very well.  I really admired him very--he's--they named a building after him, Jenkins Building.  He was a tremendous president.  And the president here, today, is a tremendous president.
Story_ID: 90705
Speaker 1: But I didn't finish telling you--I forgot--left the [U.S.] Army.  I went back--
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--
Speaker 1: --and finished my senior year and had tremendous success.
Speaker 2: You fin--you finished your senior year at Johnson C. Smith [University, Charlotte, North Carolina]?
Speaker 1: At Johnson C. Smith.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: I, I won many awards.  I wrote poetry, and I was in theater.  I, I was in charge for one year.  I was in charge of the theater.
Speaker 2: What plays did you produce?
Speaker 1: We did "Night Must Fall," and oh, oh, I, I can't think of all of 'em.  We did "Night Must Fall" and "Wuthering Heights."  And Mr. [Arthur C.] Lamb was the, the theater director at Johnson C. Smith, and he left there to come here [Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland].  They've named the, at the fine arts building, Lamb-Turpin Theater [Turpin-Lamb Theater], so he was--he left and came here.  They didn't have a person so they chose me and another person to, to direct, direct the plays.  So for, for that last year I, I directed plays.  I was also in the president of French Club and, and won the oratorical contest.  I've, I've won a lot of awards in all, and I, I enjoyed Smith very, very much.
Story_ID: 90706
Speaker 1: Then I left [Johnson C.] Smith [University, Charlotte, North Carolina], got my master's at [Case] Western Reserve [University, Cleveland, Ohio].
Speaker 2: Now how did you choose Case Western Reserve?
Speaker 1: Well, I'm from Cleveland [Ohio].
Speaker 2: Well, that's where your ment--your mentor is too.
Speaker 1: And then Dr.--and then the--Dr. [Emile Blais] De Sauze was there and encouraged me to come and be there with him.  I was very poor.  In fact, after my father [Sandy McIntyre]'s death, I had to help my two sisters in college.  I worked three jobs all the way through college.  I, I, I was secretary to, student secretary for the president, and I worked in the--as an aide to the dietician at the Charlotte hospital, and then I worked at the railroad, rail, rail station, railroad station throwing sacks of mail.  I did, I worked awfully hard, plus carrying 27, 28 credits.  So I enjoyed working, and I had a tremendous amount of success.  Then I left there and went to Western Reserve.  And I had the G.I. Bill, so therefore I didn't have any great financial problem then and did very well there, straight A's.  Then at the--
Speaker 2: Who were some of your, your teachers at Case Western Reserve that you remember?
Speaker 1: Oh, I, I remember I, I won the Duday (ph.) Award, excellence in literature, the, the--oh, there are several, Larry.  (Unclear) was primarily Duday.  I have it here, but--
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--
Speaker 1: --I, I just can't think of it right now, but I won that award too.  I won the Ode (ph.) (unclear) Award there.  What they did at Reserve was, I'd go back every summer, and they would have a visiting professor from the Sorbonne [University of Paris, Paris, France] or some university.  This (unclear) Duday was from the University of Cannes [Cannes, France], who became the president du jury, which in France is the number one professor in France.  And I had another one, Ode Bair (ph.), who became the president of the jury, president du jury, who was number one, and we became very--I won both their awards there.  The Agnes D'or (ph.) Award, that's right, I won that.  She was one of my favorite teachers.  But I would go back each summer, working on my doctorate, taking courses.  The interesting thing is I couldn't go to the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland], and the University of Maryland paid my tuition at, at Western Reserve, 'cause no blacks were there then, you know, interesting things.  Things have changed tremendously.  But anyway, I--and I got--I finished the, the two-year program in one year in a summer.  Then I came to Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland] in September of '48 [1948], just after receiving my master's.
Story_ID: 90707
Speaker 1: Okay, now how did the Fulbright Scholarship--when, when did that come in?
Speaker 2: In 1951, on May the 1st, 1951, Dr. [Martin D.] Jenkins-(clearing throat)--we had, had, we had invited to the campus in the fall of '48 [1948]--of '50 [1950], Senator Fulbright come to speak.  And I'd become very close to Senator Fulbright, and he and I were very, very close to his death.  In fact, most the canes that he, that he took with him were the canes that I gave him.  Well, anyway, he came, and he had invited me to apply for a Fulbright 'cause no blacks, they had no blacks.  And the major program they had--the program started two or three years before, but they were--what do you call them?  Programs that were--well, not temporary in nature, but I don't, I don't know the term.  They were pivotal.  Well, they, they were not full programs.  In 1951, '52 [1952] is perhaps the biggest, the first full year.  And I think I was the first--one of the first blacks to get a Fulbright.  That's what I was told at least, and the first ser--especially to France.  There were several of us blacks to France, and I was given a Fulbright to, to University of Grenoble [Grenoble, France] and the Sorbonne [University of Paris, Paris, France]; I went to both.  And this was one of the most exciting years of my life, perhaps the only year in my life where I never had to worry about money 'cause I had not only the Fulbright, I had the G.I. Bill, and then I had a couple of other grants that were given me.  So I not only did well there, but I traveled all over Europe and, and Morocco (unclear).  Really, this was one of the most exciting years.  That's a chance--I had a chance to meet some of the great literary figures, Camus.  I don't know if you've ever heard of Camus.
Speaker 1: Albert Camus.
Speaker 2: Albert Camus and I became very good friends.  We traveled in the South together.  I also had worked with Jacques Prevert, who looked at my plays and gave me advice on that, got a chance to meet [Pablo] Picasso through him, and [Henri] Matisse, went to Saint-Paul de Vence to his chapel and had dinner with him and--.
Story_ID: 90708
Speaker 1: Enjoyed Grenoble, 'cause I'd go skiing.  I stayed with Madame Jacqueline (ph.).  I had written previously to--they'd give us a list of addresses.  I'd written to her and said I'd like to, to--I was interested in getting a room there with her.  And so, when I arrived I rang the bell, and she opened the door.  And I said, Madame, je suis Monsieur McIntyre.  She said, ooh, [speaking French] (unclear)--Monsieur McIntyre.  The name Sandye McIntyre suggested a Scot (laughter).  When she saw me, said ooh, ooh, Monsieur McIntyre, ooh.  Anyway, she said I don't--she told me in French, of course, I don't think perhaps you would like being here.  You know, I don't know whether this is elegant enough for you.  I said no, I think--said I have two daughters here, and I don't know whether you would enjoy being here or not.  I said I'm certain I would, because it was close to the university, and I wanted a place where I could walk to the university.  Anyway, she became my mother, second mother, and the two kids are like my sisters, and a fabulous time; I, I really enjoyed that, that particular year, exciting year.  Then I spent the next--I spent the at, spent the previous summer at the Sorbonne, and the next summer I spent at Sorbonne.  I finished with a Diplome de Hautes Etudes de Langue et de Litterature Francaises and got a doctoral equivalency for this.  Then I came back to Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland], but I had--when made--I was made the Fulbright advisor May the 1st of '51 [1951] before I went on my own Fulbright in '51, '52 [1952], and when I came back I started working for Fulbright.  The first year I had no success.  Then the next year I had one Fulbright and then two and three.  I don't know whether you know it or not, but we had, for a long time, the highest number of Fulbrights of any college or university in the country.
Speaker 2: Right (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, and we had over a hundred Fulbrights, of course, and we certainly have more than, than any historically black institution.
Story_ID: 89681
Speaker 1: You were in Paris [France] in the years 19--
Speaker 2: Fifty-one [1951], '52 [1952].
Speaker 1: Two, okay.
Speaker 2: I was there in Paris during the war [World War II], of course.
Speaker 1: Now you--were, were you familiar with some of the contributions of the black people of French expression at that time, or did you (unclear)--
Speaker 2: I had, I had read about it, and I'd heard of, of course--I'd heard of Senghor became president [of Senegal] in 1960.
Speaker 1: Leopold [Sedar] Senghor.
Speaker 2: Leopold Senghor, and he's the one that appointed me in 1970.  I think I was his first honorary consul, and of course, I'd, I'd heard a lot of about [Aime] Cesaire and, and Du--and [Leon] Damas.  And, and I, I had a very good friend from Martinique who had, who we called him the prince, but who told me a lot about this.  So I learned an awful lot about the Negritude, and of course one of my lectures, of course, is generally on Negritude 'cause I've, I've, I knew personally Senghor, Cesaire, and Damas--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --who, who was at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], and who died, you know.  And when I go to Martinique, which I do every now and then, I spend a little time with Cesaire.
Speaker 1: Now who would you consider as the father of the Negritude movement, and could you explain what it is for the sake of those who watch this tape later?
Speaker 2: Yeah, negritude is the, the cultural expression of people of African descent.  And it's a kind of--it's not a, a symbol of superiority, but it's a symbol of recognition of what black people have accomplished, the legacy they have accomplished.  And in, you know, I went through college and except for the fact that I had a Haitian--I knew of Toussaint Louverture, of course, but I knew very little about black people.  And then in my courses in the master's and doctorate, I don't think I once--they do now, but they didn't ever talk about the great writers.  I didn't know that [Alexandre] Dumas was black.  You know, I, you know, I just for a long time didn't know [Alexander] Pushkin was black, you know, in Russia, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, now let's stop a little minute now.  Alexandre Dumas, we're talking about the author of "The Three Musketeers"--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and his, and his son [Alexandre Dumas, fils].  You know, there were, there were, they're mulattos, you know, they were black.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: But, of course, they were--Dumas was perhaps as popular as Victor Hugo in his day.  He was one of the most popular persons there.  And no, no one ever told me that he was--he was never in any book that (unclear).  He was, you know, he's French, and that's all we were, we were taught.  And so I knew very little about this.  And then I, I developed an interest later on in France, talking quite often to some of the, from the kids from the Senegal--from Senegal--and from Ivory Coast and what have you.
Story_ID: 89682
Speaker 1: But I was trying to think.  There's something I wanted to tell you about France.  I played tennis there, of course, and did well.  But what else did I--I, I met so many fabulous people there it's just incredible.  Being black in '51 [1951], '52 [1952] in Paris [France] was a fantastic thing.  Everybody--being black in Europe--an example would be after, after I finished the Sorbonne [University of Paris] in the summer of '52, I took that money that I'd gotten from the sale of the Matisse and the Picasso to go to Scandinavia.  And I had a friend--I met a friend who was, who--I met a guy and who became friends, and he--we drove to Oslo [Norway] and we split the costs.  From Oslo to Sweden I hitchhiked.  And the moment I stuck my thumb out, ten cars stopped, and they say I saw him first; he's mine (laughter), you know, that kind of thing.  And I was treated so royally there, and I, and I could think of how I was treated in the United States.  But I was treated royally all over.  I was invit--I--when I went to Stockholm [Sweden], you won't believe it.  On--I finally got on the train and someone paid my, paid, paid for my ticket, and I had on the--I had about ten invitations to come and spend time with people in, in Stockholm.  And this was all over Scandinavia, Scandinavia.  I had tremendous friends in France, tremendous friends.  People were very, very nice to me, very, very nice, and I enjoyed the experience.  Of course, this all has helped make my French more accurate, and more authentic, and automatic.  So I, I was fluent before I went there, but I became, I, I began to--oh, for a long time, even, even high school, I started writing in my diary in French and, and all, all--if I write any notes down now they are in French.  I think in French.  I, I think I dream in French (laughter), but I'm not too sure, you know, because I've been doing this all--just about most of my life, you know.
Story_ID: 89683
Speaker 1: But the, the, the coming back from France, I worked with my students and they had tremendous success with the Fulbright Program.  And many of them went to France.  I just had lunch--I had dinner night before--when was that--Thursday night with Ambassador of France at the Council of Foreign Affairs.  He spoke here, and we had dinner with him.  And we were talking about some of the success of our students in France, and he had asked me to even write him about some of the things that had happened.  We received many awards.  Once we--of the 120 (unclear)--(unclear)--we had more (unclear) for Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Marylands] than all of those put together.  And, and five years ago, there were only five Fulbrights to historically black universities, and all five came from Morgan.  I'm, I'm a member of the--I was a member of, of the National Team.  I'm their national lecturer consultant.  I've gone around speaking, you know, on behalf--trying to--evidence to advisors, what they can do to help speed up their program and to facilitate their program.  I've been--one of the things, interesting things, she's from Mississippi, my associate director.  She's from Mississippi, Millsaps College [Jackson, Mississippi].  One of the places I was there to, to speak was at Millsaps College.  And I arrived there and spoke on my birthday, September the 18th.  That day, in Mississippi, they gave me a birthday party there; at lunchtime, had a big cake for me; and that night they invited, the governor, invited me to a restaurant with some, with some of the members of our Ful--Fulbright group, on my birthday.  You know, this is Mississippi, you know, just I, when you think of, of Mississippi, you just can't conceive of the kinds of treatment that a black will receive there.  But they were very, very nice to me, extremely nice, changed my whole opinion about Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Things have changed, I guess, since--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 89684
Speaker 1: But, let me go back a minute to 1951 in France.  Did you meet any of the Negro expatriates in, in France there, the writers, and I know at one time it was a favorite place of--
Speaker 2: Wright--
Speaker 1: Richard Wright.
Speaker 2: --went there.
Speaker 1: James Baldwin and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I, I, I've met Baldwin; I've met Wright, and I can't--I've met them on several occasions, and, and right now I can't remember whether it was first there or here.  But I, I, I, and I never knew them personally, but I'd go to, to conferences where they spoke and I'd then I'd have a chance to talk with them or something like that.
Speaker 1: Some of the musicians there--
Speaker 2: Oh, musicians?  Well, you know, one of my favorite people was Dizzy Gillespie.  I even taught Dizzy Gillespie the French that he knew.  In fact, we were at Paris [France] together and in Grenoble [France].  And he'd call me mon petit [speaking French] (unclear) my little pal.  And we were good friend.  In fact, I interviewed him on the radio in Cleveland [Ohio].  I did a little disc jockey work, just a little bit and interviewed him.  But we, we became very good friends, Dizzy Gillespie, from Cheraw, South Carolina.  Don Byas, he--Don Byas, I don't guess you would know him, but he, he was born in 1951, '52 [1952].  He was one of the leading saxophonist, black saxophonist, and they all loved France because they were treated like gods.  You know, you go, that place was packed (unclear).  And then I'd be invited to go backstage and have dinner with him and all--fabulous, fabulous time.  I've met some-Brigitte Bardot--(unclear).
Speaker 1: She was--yeah, that was in the six--she started emerging in the late '50s [1950s], I guess, when she started.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in, in '50s, yeah.
Story_ID: 89685
Speaker 1: She [Brigitte Bardot] was an attractive woman.  I have been kissed on the cheek by Sophia Loren, Jacqueline Kennedy, and I, I can think of as lot of people whom I admired and had little crushes on, but she is one of the, one of the most exciting people I met, you know--"...And God Created Woman," was the name of that movie, and she would start off with her completely naked, with her little derriere showing---"Et Dieu...crea la femme"--And she, she really was a--I used to go to some of the clubs with some of my friends, and she was in one of the clubs when I met her.  But I really liked her very much, yeah.
Speaker 2: Now, Josephine Baker, did you see her again--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I, I, saw her two or three times and went to the chateau in Southern France and met her in Paris [France] once or twice.
Speaker 2: You went to her chateau [Chateau des Milandes], that, that--
Speaker 1: I went to the chateau--
Speaker 2: --that castle that she lives--
Speaker 1: Yeah, un-huh.  I went there once, yeah.
Speaker 2: Now what--can you tell, tell, tell us some more about her.  Now this is--now you, you--
Speaker 1: You know, you know, you know--
Speaker 2: this is a person now that you actually get to know, and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, you know--
Speaker 2: --she is a fascinating person--
Speaker 1: --Well, you know--
Speaker 2: --(unclear)--
Speaker 1: --she, she made herself famous, of course, by dancing with bananas in front, you know, and covering up.  And the Folies Bergere, she was just the star; she was the number one star there.  And of course, as she grew older, some of her popularity disappeared, but she was admired all over Europe.  When I went to the Tivoli [Gardens] in Copenhagen [Denmark] to see her, and that was about the year or so before she died, the place was packed.  And she and I had dinner together that night and talked to about two or three in the morning, you know.  She was really, really a fabulous person, and that's all I can say about her.  It's just that she, a very courageous woman.  As you know, she, she was with the resistance, resistance.  And--but, but France forgot her after a wee bit.  They--she lost her chateau and her children, you know.  She was--
Speaker 2: She really dealt some risky finances, from what I understand, so.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: (Unclear), but when she died, she had, I heard she had the, the grandest funeral ever, ever in France.
Speaker 1: It, it, it was one of the--it was a--
Speaker 2: (unclear) de Gaulle (unclear).
Speaker 1: It was a fabulous one.
Story_ID: 89686
Speaker 1: By the way, I, I, I--as a member of the [U.S.] Army, I won a, I, I won a Bronze Star Medal.  And it was pinned on me by whom?  [President Charles] de Gaulle.  There were about twenty-five of us, and he came along in, in Paris [France] and pinned it on.  I also got the (unclear)--after I got a brief commission as a second lieutenant, I got the oak le--oak leaf cluster.  But I never will forget de Gaulle.  And I jokingly say I was kissed on the cheek by de Gaulle, but I don't recall his kissing me on the cheek (laughter).  I think he just shook hands, you know.  But de Gaulle was a person whom I admired very much--very arrogant, extremely arrogant, but a brilliant man, really brilliant.
Speaker 2: With the nose and--
Speaker 1: With the nose, oh yeah.  And of course, I, I met his son, who's tall and, and similar to him.  But I've, I've been extremely fortunate with my connections in France.
Story_ID: 89687
Speaker 1: And this, these are things that--memories that come back to--and you say to yourself sometimes: I worked for fifty-five years.  I have no money to show for it as such.  I've only got fabulous memories.  I've been to every major country in the world, and I've talked with heads of state and all.  I've got paintings and artifacts from all over the world, but I have very little finance to show for it, you know.  But I say is--what's more important, that or the memories, or the contacts you made, the people you've encountered, and I have encountered some fabulous people, not only heads of state and dignitaries, but people like cab drivers.  I recall Dr. [Carleen] Leggett and I went up to see La de Falls (ph.) and we were with, with an Algerian cab driver who told us about the tremendous, the terrible treatment.  That's, by the way, this is one of the things that [Albert] Camus and I had together because Camus is Algerian--considered himself a second-class citizen where France is concerned, and I consider myself as a second-class citizen here.  One other thing I didn't tell you is while going to--while with the, the inspector general, I had a chance--he had a 15-minute session with Mahatma Gandhi, and I went with him.  He had to leave, and I stayed there two more hours and chatted with Mahatma Gandhi for, for at least two and a half hours.
Speaker 2: Now what did you talk about?
Speaker 1: We talked about: one, segregation and South, and South Africa.  Of course, he was segregated tremendously and mistreated, and I talked about how I was mistreated.  And--
Speaker 2: Many people don't know that Gandhi was from South Africa.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: They assume he was from India.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Though he was an Indian, he was a South African Indian.
Speaker 1: South African Indian, yes.  But he, he was so--and [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] invited me to talk with him a couple of times.  I think I had, I had dinner with him once.  But the fact that I had met Mahatma Gandhi, who, who, who was his--you know.  That was the man, you know.  But I'll tell you, that was a very simple man, very simple.  I recall the little, the little bittersweet tea we had, the biscuits, and the little (unclear)--and very simple life.  But I think he's one of the persons I admire the most.  I admire him.  I admire him.  I think the people I admire the most, I think my father is one of them, Mahatma Gandhi, [President Anwar] Sadat, whom I, I'd met.  And Sadat, at one of the dinners I went to with him, called me his little brother because we both had nappy hair here, you know.
Speaker 2: Anwar Sadat.
Speaker 1: Anwar Sadat.
Speaker 2: President of Egypt.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Just, I--
Speaker 2: Did, did--
Speaker 1: I, I met Malcolm X when he came here.  He and I debated in one of, had a little debate 'cause I was an internationalist.  And I never believed in, in--I always felt that we were all brothers.  That's the kind of stuff that I've always lived with my life, taught to me by my father.  We were all brothers.  There were many Jewish people that lived near us, and they were all considered brothers as far as my father was concerned.  But I, I, I was a part of the organization, or the BLEWS (ph.) here, the blacks and Jews.  I worked with them for a very long time.  I haven't been able to go out in the last two or three years, but I've been very close to them.  And I've always felt that people are my brothers.  I, I don't know.  I, I grew up with that idea, yeah.  But, I was talking about Mahatma Gandhi.  It's an impression that lives with you the rest of your life, you know.
Speaker 2: He, he--
Speaker 1: He was killed in 1948 I think.  I thought I saw him in '46 [1946], '45 [1945] or '46, when I was with the inspector general.
Speaker 2: Did he have any advice about what black Americans should be?
Speaker 1: You know, all I can recall is our talking about philosophy in general.  He, he, he knew that I had one of my majors I had done was philosophy.  And we talked about philosophy and the nonviolence and what America should--blacks should do, not become violent, and that eventually there's a cycle, and you overcome with the passage of time.
Story_ID: 89688
Speaker 1: Okay. --we were talking about a Fulbright Program.  I told you I served as a lecturer and consultant.  I was also consultant for the Board of Foreign Scholarships, which administered the Fulbright Program.  The--among one of their national committees.  The--Senator [J. William] Fulbright was one of the persons I admired the most.  What he did, he did more for making people recognize the value of the United States and its culture through his program of international understanding than all of the money we have given to countries for armaments.  He, he was a Rhodes Scholar himself, just as [President] Bill Clinton was.  By the way, that's another person I like.  I don't care what anybody says about Bill Clinton; I like him.  He's a Rhodes Scholar, and he recognized the value of international education.  So when this was approved by Congress, tremendous--you know, you have approximately a thousand pre-doctoral students going abroad every year, and you have maybe fifteen hundred people coming over here e--doctoral to pre-doctoral.  The, the, the doctoral program, of course, is administered not through the Institute of International Education out of New York, but out of CIES [Comparative and International Education Society] in Washington [D.C.], and you have to have a doctorate to get that.  Well, we don't, Dr. [Carleen] Leggett and I, do not administer the, the doctoral Fulbrights.  We counsel them.  When they have problems, they'd come in.  We'll talk to them about that.  And we've had numerous professors to get Fulbright, doctoral Fulbrights.  They are lecturing or research Fulbrights (unclear).  The U.S. Student Program is for study abroad, and there they go to study.  Now we have a French student right now in France who's working with, with a Fulbright related grant, the Fulbright, the Teaching Assistantship Award.  We have a, a Teaching Assistantship Award also in, in South Korea.  This year we, so far, we have two people who have Fulbrights, one to South Korea, again, as a teaching assistant and one to India.  We've had, we've had, I guess, thirty or forty countries that have been represented and all of the departments here at Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland], 'cause they're not just the foreign language.  It's for anybody who's interested in traveling abroad.  So we've had many, most of the--most of the departments have had a least one or two Fulbrights.  We had more, of course, from the foreign language department 'cause the whole idea was the study to improve their language, language skills.  But I've enjoyed working with them.  I really have--this, right now, I'm not teaching.  I'm, I'm working only as the director of the Fulbright Program.  But up until two or three years ago, I was teaching a graduate course and also an undergrad--one of the undergraduate course and a graduate course.  The undergraduate course was Advance French Conversation Composition, which I've taught for the whole time since I've been here, and a graduate course in, in interpretation, translation and interpretation.  We've had fantastic success here at Morgan.  At one time, one third to one half of all of the foreign language teachers in the Baltimore Public School System were graduates of Morgan, were my former students, one third, one half.  That has changed recently, but we have a tremendous amount of success with our students.  And some, some of the, some of the notables, I'm thinking are the people in the, in the Maryland legislature were our former students, and some were Fulbrighters.  The dean of our college of liberal arts was a Fulbright scholar to India, and many of the teachers here who were Morgan graduates were former Fulbright students, and they've done extremely well.  I, I can look at my students in French who, who were not only Fulbright students, went out and got their doctorate.  Some are teaching at--one is teaching at Dartmouth [College, Hanover, New Hampshire], another at South Carolina, University of South Carolina [Columbia, South Carolina], and one at Univer-UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles].  They get, they get a good background here, very good background.  But time is changing, and emphasis is not placed as much on French now as it once was.  Spanish has become all enveloping.  Many of the French kids that I taught are now teaching Spanish because they have a need for Spanish teachers.  And since, if you had a major in French, you'd have a minor generally in Spanish, so they're teaching, yeah.
Story_ID: 89689
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask you about the importance of French expression in the African-American experience on some level.  They--you know, we have--one of the blackest cities in the United States is Detroit [Michigan], Detroit (French pronunciation).
Speaker 2: Detroit (French proununciation) (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--one of the key figures from the post-colonial period is [Jean Baptiste Point du Sable]--
Speaker 2: DuSable, yeah.
Speaker 1: --which is how we say it here, but it should be--
Speaker 2: DuSable [French pronunciation].
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you know, can you, can you speak to some of that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, only I don't--I know--I told you about DuSable.  Only thing I knew is, of course, that he had influence, and in Chicago [Illinois] they named a high school after him.
Speaker 1: Does the name mean--
Speaker 2: Sin.  LeSable means sin.  In fact, my name Sandye is Sablonneux (laughter), you know.  The kids used to joke with me about my name occasionally.  They, they would call me, they'd say Monsieur Sablonneux, Sandye, de ma ceinture.  Ma ceinture means my belt, but McIntyre is the closest they could get to that, so ma ceinture, Sablonneux ma ceinture (laughter), they'd joke.  I write--I wrote French plays, and of course, my, many of my students, we always had--I wrote generally four French plays, two of Christmastime, an advance one and a, and an intermediate and one--and at the end of the this, the year, that is in May.  And I have some, some fifty French plays that when I--generally they're one act plays.  And we presented here [Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland], and we traveled to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], and Virginia State [University, Petersburg, Virginia], and Salisbury, and we, we, we've given them all over to New York, we've gone with our plays.  And kids enjoy it of course, the week we'd take off to, to travel with the plays and all.  And once you--I wrote the plays primarily because if you memorize a play (unclear), and you get an authentic pronunciation, 'cause we insist upon authentic pronunciation, 'cause authenticity and automaticity are perhaps the two most important things of language learning.  You have to be automatic, where if I ask you something about what is your name, you don't hesitate; you tell me that very quickly, and it's automatic, and it has to be authentic.  In many--before 19--before World War II, there were only two colleges and universities in the country that insisted upon the exclusive use of the language in the classroom; that was Middlebury [College, Middlebury, Vermont] and [Case] Western Reserve [University, Cleveland, Ohio], only two.  And Dr. [Emile Blais] De Sauze insisted upon the automatic use of language and the authentic use of the language so that the pronunciation is, must be exact and accurate, so when they learn to pronounce roles in a play, they not only learn their own role, but listening to the others, they learn the others.  They developed a kind of ability to speak that's just amazing.  So even in my first year class I never used any English and using cognates, even after the first week after they'd learn pronunciation.  Did you wanna, wanna talk to him.
Speaker 1: Just finish your sentence and I--
Speaker 2: But at, at the end of the first week, I could talk to them about, in French, about le gouvernement Francais, the French government, 'cause they're syn--they're cognates, the words that are similar in both languages, le capitaine, and so forth.
Story_ID: 88418
Speaker 1: All right, let me ask you about Haiti.  You were a counselor--
Speaker 2: I was consul.  I was vice-consul, then became consulate of the Republic of Haiti back in '56 [1956], '57 [1957], and of course I made many trips to Haiti.  The language there is spoken by most people is Creole.  There are many people in Haiti who don't speak French, but they speak Creole.  The, the learned speak excellent French, because many of them go to France to get their degrees.  Haiti's a country that I've, I have always admired.  First because my teacher, Jean Adam, who is Haitian, because they're, they're a beautiful people, but the one of the most impoverished people, people on, on the face of the earth, very poor and--
Speaker 1: Can, can you speak to the importance of the history of Haiti (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, you know--
Speaker 1: --the black people in this hemisphere.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, that goes back to the time when the, the French, of course, controlled Haiti.  And then there was an uprising when Toussaint Louverture and some of the other great--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--from Haiti--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--all--
Speaker 2: And they, they threw the French out, basically, and they had tremendous problems in the beginning, just as they have tremendous problems now.  But I became very close to, to the Haitians, to the president of Haiti and to the ambassador of Hai--in fact, before Papa Doc [Francois Duvalier] came to power.  When Papa Doc came to power, I lost my, my position as honorary consul of Haiti.  We, we kind of broke off relationships basically with them.
Speaker 1: Papa Doc was the infamous dictator of Haiti--
Speaker 2: He was, he was--
Speaker 1: --Jean-Claude [sic, Francois] Duvalier [Francois' was succeeded by his son, Jean-Claude].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And of course I did not go to Haiti during that period of time.  In fact, I don't think I've--let's see--no, I haven't been there since then.  I, I went two or three times before then, and I was treated royally by the president and--but the people are so warm.  And, and you know, the--some of the things there that I saw--I saw--I was invited--because this is rare for a non-Haitian to go to a voodoo ceremony.  I've been to several voodoo ceremonies, real ones, where they were, the blood was thrown all over the chicken and everything.  And I just--at first I thought this was rather primitive.  Then I realized that this was a religion for most of these people based on the Catholic faith and their African legacy.  So they took some of that, their African legacy, and mixed it with, with the Catholic faith and, and produced a, a kind of religion, which is voodoo.
Story_ID: 88419
Speaker 1: You have similar kinds of things done in, in, in Brazil.  I went to a ceremony in Brazil, which reminded me so much of the Haitian voodoo ceremonies.
Speaker 2: I think they call it Candomble.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Candomble, yes.  And--
Speaker 2: You can speak Portuguese too, don't you?
Speaker 1: Well, I, I have never had a course in Portuguese, but I, I lectured in Portuguese because I took my Spanish, got a nasal sound (laughter), you know, and, and gave, gave an A--well, they had (unclear)--and I took tapes.  I, I worked as an interpreter and consultant for Phelps Stokes Fund program.  And I was there interpreting consul (unclear) all over Africa, and Brazil, and Morocco, and India.  And I went with them, people I'd admired very, very much.  Dr. [Samuel] Myers [HM] was the head of it.  He's a person you really ought to, to work with.  History, HistoryMakers would really be pleased to have someone of his caliber.
Speaker 2: This is, who, who, who's this?
Speaker 1: Dr. Myers.
Speaker 2: Doctor--
Speaker 1: Sam Myers.
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--
Speaker 1: And he was pres--he was president for a long time of Bowie [State University, Bowie Maryland], Bowie.
Speaker 2: Bowie State (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, very close friend, and I'm a very close friend of the family, very close with them, very close.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But I spoke Portuguese.  And one of the interesting things, I, I was on television, and I spoke in Portuguese.  And I was telling them that, that Brazil was one of the melting pots of the world and one of the places I admired the most, 'cause they didn't have the kinds of segregation that I'd seen in the States (laughter).  When I got back to the hotel, I had at least a hundred black Brazilians ready to string me up (unclear).  And they said what do you mean?  If you go to the university, one--less than one percent of the teachers are black.  You look at the government, less than five percent are black, are, are black, you know, colored, you know, whatever you want to--what term you want to use, of African descent.  And it's just they just said this is, this is the most segregated country in the world.  And I had to apologize because I really didn't know.  And some of my lectures I'd made in Thailand and China and all about the, the, the great melting pots of the world where people disappear as far as their color is concerned.  I mentioned always Brazil.  Now I found out (laughter) they--you know, that I was wrong, that they have problems there too.
Story_ID: 88420
Speaker 1: I've been to every major country in the world, and there are color problems all over.  If you go to India, you, you go to Southern India where people are dark-skinned and all, you rarely see them in, in, in, in, in high forms of government.  And some of--you know, and that's one of the things that Mahatma Gandhi tried to fight against, the caste system as--and also the color system, you know, dark-skinned people being treated differently.  And I just wonder sometimes, and that's one of the great, my great problems, one of the great problems which I would like to see a solution.  Is there any hope one day for erasing the basic fear that people have of dark-skinned people?  Now, you, you don't find this tremendous fear--you didn't when I went to Scandin--I've been to Scandinavia at least five or six times, but every time I went, I never had a problem.  But there are so few dark-skinned people there, there's no problem.  And in France at one time I didn't discover any real problem, but I understand now from some--when I go back to my African friends that there are problems.  There's a tremendous amount of--
Speaker 2: The Algerians and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: The Algerians (unclear)--(unclear) Algerians are not--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --necessarily black people, they're African-- Senegalese to--
Speaker 2: --Senegalese there--
Speaker 1: --people from (unclear).
Speaker 2: --(unclear), yeah.  And so, there are problems.  And of course, when I, when I used to discuss this with [President] Francois Mitterand, said oh no, no, no [speaking French], we don't have that problem.  I said, Monsieur Mitterand, what about the Algerians, you know?  [Speaking French]--(unclear), it's different, see, [speaking French]--(unclear), you know.  But we'd have different discussions about that.  Will there ever be a solution of that problem?  Well, my great-great--I have, I am a grand--the proud grandfather of a five-year-old boy and a five-month-old girl, who is the most beautiful thing in the world, Camille.  I went to--about a month ago, I went up for her christening.  I wonder will she ever see the day when one will not look at her out of her--out of her beautiful, of course, they'd be looking at her because she's a, a beautiful child, but the fact that she's brown.  I think of--my, my daughter [Monique McIntyre Brown], my daughter got her master's from Brandeis University [Waltham, Massachusetts], and she's an actress.  And she's been in many plays.  She, she was in, for two years at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival.  She's played all kinds of roles and in--she lives in Boston [Massachusetts].  And she says that she doesn't notice any real problem because of her color except for certain roles that she would want, and then she has a little difficulty with that.  I just wonder sometimes, will this ever happen in the lifetime of my great-grandchildren or my great-great-grandchildren.  I don't know.  Because I've always felt a, a, a friendship with people of all races, you know.  Wherever I go I always make friends.  The first place, I treat them as equals; I'm, I'm tolerant of their different beliefs.  You know, you don't believe as I do, it doesn't mean that you're a bad person.  It's just that we don't agree.  We have different religions, and I've learned to accept the fact that I really--I have a, a religious belief, but I don't necessarily insist upon the fact that you do have the same belief that I have.  I might try to persuade you to accept my belief or disbelief.  But I've, I've dealt with Muslims.  I've been to Saudi Arabia, and I've been all over, and I've seen a different world.  And they have been--they've grown accustomed to their world, and I would like to change some of this.  But who am I to change; who am I to say what changes should be made.  All I can do is try to live a moral life, a good life, and to be tolerant of others.
Story_ID: 88421
Speaker 1: You received many awards, as we--the room we're sitting in is covered with awards, and--but we, we don't pan around a room.  But for anybody who wants to read about 'em, they'll be in your archive box at The HistoryMakers, all of the, all of the list of awards.  But we're all--we're also surrounded by African art, and African art and Haitian art, and there's a particular story about a devil mask I think you wanted to tell.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.  On one of the conferences that--on one of the conferences I helped establish for, for the American Association of Teachers of French [AATF], to be, to be held in (unclear), in Sen--in Dakar [Senegal], I arranged it with the president.  And we--I, I, I used to go every two or three years to Senegal, but I never--we--I--we got there that Sunday, and then that Monday we went walking down streets in the markets.  And we saw this huge devil mask, which is--how, how many feet would that be, you'd think, about--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)-
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  Two and a half.
Speaker 1: Two and a half feet.
Speaker 2: Two and a half, two and a half to three feet.  And I fell in love with it.  And I asked the guy, I said I'd like to buy that.  He says "attention c'est un masque de diable", it's a devil mask.  I said yes, that's okay, thank you very much (unclear).  I said how much?  Well, he, he quoted some tre--outrageous price like five or six hundred dollars.  I said [speaking French]--(unclear).  No, I'm, I'm a black tourist. I'm not a white tourist.  I don't have money like that (laughter), you know.  So we joked and talked for a while, ended up, he says okay, four hundred, [speaking French]--(unclear), [speaking French] (unclear) dollar (ph.).  Then we talked a little bit.  I said well, I'll come back.  I came back the next day, he--was about 300.  Then the next day I came back it was 250.  Marchander is to haggle over the prices, a term used in French, marchander, and so that, that is the, that's what is done in Africa and in many other places in the world.  That is an insult to accept the price that they give you because that means you don't want to talk to them.  So we talked, and we talked, and on that Friday, just before he left, I think I got it for a hundred dollars, something like that.  But he was so nice, I, I gave him--I bought him all, practically all my clothes that I had, and I gave 'em the clothes and gave him some, some stuff for his children, bought, bought a lot of things or his children.  We've become very good friends.  And I said--I went--I had a series of lectures to do through Africa, the Ivory Coast, in (unclear).  And so, Dr. [Carleen] Leggett, my associate, was there with me, and I said I'm going--you're going back to Paris [France].  Would you take the mask with you to Paris, and I'll join you in Paris after this two-week lecture tour?  She said certainly.  She, she put this mask on the, the luggage--what do you call that, you know?
Speaker 1: The rack?
Speaker 2: --luggage rack, and on, on the bus going to the airport, and it fell down and put a gash in her head, and, and it--you see the sharp points there--and a gash in the head of the woman behind her.  And--oh, oh, in the airport--then they got to the airport.  In the airport, they had it on one of those carts, and it cut a guy on the side.  And we kept thinking--she kept thinking about the (laughter) devil mask.  So we came--we got back to Morgan, and that was--my office was then over in Holmes Hall--and I was putting it up--and there were a lot of boxes there--and I was putting it up and I fell.  And when I looked up, that mask was looking at me.  I said now I'm not superstitious person.  I don't believe in this nonsense, you know.  I just don't believe in this.  And we--another time, we just mentioned the word mask, and her name plate fell off.  And so I said okay, I'm gonna fix this.  I took that thing down.  I put a cross on the back, a crescent, and a Star of David, and I haven't had (laughter) any problem since.  And then I say, I say that I don't know whether that had anything to do with it.  But we, we often think about the, the, the devil mask.
Speaker 1: So it's a Wolof mask, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah, it's--
Speaker 1: Does it represent a particular deity of the Wolof people?
Speaker 2: Not to my knowledge.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: I ask him--
Speaker 1: --you know they have same devil as Christians have?
Speaker 2: No, but I ask him to ex--tell me why he called it devil mask.  He said [speaking French]--(unclear), that's all I have to say, it's a ma--and be very careful, he says, faites attention, be careful.  And we did give us a few problem, yeah.

Speaker 1: Okay, Sir, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: I, I suggested to you in a moment--a few moments ago, I suggested to you that, that there ought to be a solution to the so-called color problem, and whether it's going to happen in my time or the time of my great-grandchildren or my great-grandchildren I don't know.  But I would like for, I would like--'cause I taught at a black university for 55 years, and they are bright kids, eager kids.  But some of them are lacking in intensity of purpose.  Is there a real reason for being here except economic or being able to get a better job, a better salary?  And the, the, the loss of a desire to really be proficient in your own language first, be knowledgeable about English, and using English as it should be used.  I was--I, I did a program for the broadcasting for--I've done many programs for the French broadcasting system, and I've done a Canadian broadcasting system.  But one, they asked me about [clearing throat]--for as one I did on the problems of blacks in America and also one about how we should be called.  When [Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson [HM] brought up the, the element of--we talked about once Negro, then colored, and then Afro American, then African American and all of that, then I had--I gave my comments on that.  I, I personally, black--I have--in other words, there's--I don't know of a single African who mind being called noir, black--[speaking French] (unclear)--and he's proud of the fact.  There is--I don't find the inferiority complex with an African black, with an African generally they are black except in some aspects of Northern Africa.  And there is no inferiority complex.  But I find that many black Americans have an inferiority complex, and that bothers me a little bit because in reality they're strong people, they're, they're, they're beautiful people.  And if they start comparing their economic situation to somebody else's who happens to be of a different color situation, there comes a, a feeling of inferiority.  Well, is that inferiority due to their, their color, or is it due to their lack, or their lack of purpose, intensity of purpose?  And if, if, if they would concentrate, it seems to me, on, on doing the very best that they can, whether it's in teaching or whether it's in the commercial avenues or venues, whatever it is to be superior, try to be superior in whatever you do.  Now, African athletes have developed that feeling.  Many--I mean not all, of course; you can't generalize.  But many African athletes have developed a feeling of superiority, and they want to be superior, superior, and they want to win.  I admire that.  If this could be placed in the realm of academia, if this could be placed in the realm of, of the business world, this would be a fantastic suc--we could be a fantastically successful people, but we don't do that always.  One, are we willing to make the sacrifice?  To do anything well, you have to make a sacrifice.  If I have garnered a couple a hundred awards, it's because I would stay up here many a night to two and three o'clock in the morning.  And unfortunately, I sometimes was scolded at my home for doing this.  And I think sometimes my son [Sandye Jean McIntyre, III] would, would occasionally say that, you know, daddy, you spend so much time there that you, you don't spend much time here.  But I, I always spent, always--before my kids would go to bed, I'd go up and read them a story, or I'd, every night for a long time, I'd make up a story.  I'd say, what do you want me to talk about tonight?  And, and we'd talk.  One time my daughter said doorknob, so I made up a fabulous story about that poor little doorknob that was ignored.  Nobody even noticed a doorknob, and yet it was a means of entering a room.  And all of a sudden people began to understand the importance of that doorknob, and it began to shine; light came from it.  Then they went to sleep.  I'd do this every night.  They would choose a subject, and I'd make up a story.  Then I'd go back to the office and work.  And I did, of course--I, I never got a day off for being Fulbright advisor.  I never got any money for it, my regular salary.  I was well-paid as, as a Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Marlyand] professor, and I just accepted this as one of my responsibilities and that I accepted this also out of pride, 'cause anything I do, I like to do well.  If I play tennis, I want to win, whatever I do.  If I debate, I want to win.  When I was on the debating team, I didn't wa--I, I didn't lose 'cause I, I prepared for it and did well.  And that's been the story of my life.
Story_ID: 88423
Speaker 1: Okay.  Sir--well, this is almost seems redundant from what you just said, but we always ask people what would they consider as their legacy.
Speaker 2: What would legacy be?  My legacy, of course, would be, of necessity, the Fulbright Program, trying to evidence to other historically black college and universities that they, too, can be successful. Second, French, getting people to understand that you don't learn French by using English, but by constantly using the language in authentic fashion. And third would be, having an international perspective on things.  I've been involved with the international life for so long that I see us all in kindred fashion, that we, we have responsibilities toward peoples of the world, people who are different from us, people who don't think as we do.  I have a tremendous amount of sympathy for the Iraqi people.  I don't agree with what's been happening in Iraq, you know.  I'm a pacifist basically.  I got that from [Mahatma] Gandhi.  I'm a pacifist, but basically at time--I think at times force is necessary.  But I, I don't, I don't look at people as being other than a, a brother who may be distant from me at a given point, who may think differently from me, whose religion may be different from mine.  And so I, I'm an internationalist, and I would like for other blacks to become more internationally-minded, become more interested in com--commerce outside of the United States; there's fantastic fields for that.  [C.] Payne Lucas [HM], I think, is another one who's, who's tried to get blacks interested in business outside of the United States.
Story_ID: 88424
Speaker 1: Okay.  And sir, one final question.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: How would I like to be remembered?  Well, one is a, as a good father and a good grandfather, as a sincere and dedicated teacher, as an internationalist, one who's interested in the problems of the world, not just the problems of Baltimore [Maryland] or Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland]; I'd like to be remembered as someone who cared about other people.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: My pleasure.
Story_ID: 88425
Speaker 1: Ready? This is the newest addition to my family.  This is Camille Illian (ph.) Brown, who, on June the 10th will be--let's see, was born in January, January, February, March, April, May, June--she'll be five months old.  I just recently attended her christening in Boston [Massachusetts].  That's--I have two grandchildren, and that's the latest.
Speaker 2: The president of Israel, [Ephraim] Katzir.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: That's the president of, of, he's the president of Israel.  And I was invited--I was the dean of a group of, of black educators, presidents and what have you who were invited to go to Israel as the guests of the Israeli government.  And then, then I was invited to his, to, to his home there to have dinner.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  What was the year?
Speaker 2: I have it written down there.  I'd be 1973, '74 [1974].  This would be 1974.
Speaker 1: That's my, my wedding, 1953, to Rosalyn, Rosalind McIntyre.  She was Rosalind Lynn then, Rosalind Lynn McIntyre.  We are separated now, but that was my wife then.
Speaker 2: That was taken back in the '70s [1970s].  I don't know exactly what year, but back in the '70s and at one of the lectures that I was giving.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  Do you remember where?
Speaker 2: At this particular one, I think this was at Virginia State College [now Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia].  That was at Virginia State College.
Speaker 1: This is, as I, I am, an officer.  She--in the Order of the Academic Palms.  And my colleague, Dr. [Carleen] Leggett, was received the, the knighthood.  I was a knight before in, in 1973, and I became an officer in 1981.  But she's receiving her knighthood with the council, the cultural council of the embassy.  I was with them at the time.
Speaker 2: Top is when I received my first knighthood from the French government.  And this was about--this is the consul of--one of the consuls from the embassy.  They gave me my knighthood.
Speaker 1: And this is a picture of my daughter [Monique McIntyre Brown] and my son [Sandye Jean McIntyre, III], when she was about, I guess, about four years old, and he was about one and a half or two years old.
Speaker 2: Oh, that, that, that's back in the '70s [1970s], too, so that was probably taken in, in, in the foreign language laboratory at Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 1: This is a photo of me in the [U.S.] Army, and this was in Belgium in Moushieno (ph.) Pune (ph.)  Wait a minute, hold on.  That was in France.  I believe that one was in France at, in Amiens, France.  I was just before--let's see--that was just before I went with the, the inspector general (unclear).
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  Do you remember who's with you?
Speaker 1: On the trip to France?
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  In the photograph here.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's, that's, that's my, that was my supply sergeant, and his, his name escapes me.
Speaker 2: I was about, about eleven, ten or eleven there, in Cleveland [Ohio].
Speaker 1: What is that?  Oh, that was a, a trip to--in 1952--to Italy with a friend of mine in the gondola in Venice.
Speaker 2: When one of the actors did--wouldn't show up, I would take the role myself.  And I loved to do this 'cause, as I said, my daughter got her master's in theater arts, and she got it from me.
Speaker 1: I never would have thought that you would love that (laughter).
Speaker 2: I loved--and I've been in, I've been off-Broadway.  I've done a little of everything.  I, I love the theater.  But I was getting ready for a role in one of the plays.
Speaker 1: That's an award I got as the outstanding Maryland educator.
Speaker 2: That's the top one.  That's a--I was, I guess, about fourteen or fifteen in, in Cleveland.
Speaker 1: And here I was in France in Alpe d'Huez, in the Alps skiing.
Speaker 2: About what year?
Speaker 1: That was in 1952, 50--it was 1951, '52 [1952], 'cause we'd go almost every weekend, pretend to study, take with us our books and all and never look at a book, of course.
Story_ID: 88426
Speaker 1: That's in Grenoble, France, and outside of the window of my room at Madame Jacqueline's apartment there.  They had just plaited my hair while I was asleep.
Speaker 2: And then a tennis photo.  I told you in nineteen fif--1962 to about 1967 I was number one in Baltimore Tennis Club.
Speaker 1: My [U.S.] Army photo from--that could--I would imagine that was in also in Amiens, France. A-M-I-E-N-S, France. I was top sergeant over the company, first sergeant.
Speaker 2: This is when I received, about four or five years ago, the International Award, and with a sash and a medal that I received, established the Dr. Sandye Jean McIntyre, II International Award for students going abroad.
Speaker 1: This is one my trips to--one of my many trips to China--and going up the, the Wall, the, the Great Wall of China.
Speaker 2: Did you ever go to Vietnam?
Speaker 1: Yes, I was there too.
Speaker 2: This was at time of the same award, with the Secretary of Labor, who was there to help present me with the award.  The-[President] Bill Clinton's Secretary of Labor.  What's her name, you know?
Speaker 1: Alexis Herman [HM].
Speaker 2: Alexis Herman, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's in my old office, and that was back in the 1980s, 1980.  I took, took a series of photos.  They did a lot of--for both of these, they did write-ups in, in the Baltimore Sun and in the, in the--about ten newspapers they did articles on me.  And that's one of the arti--pictures they took for their article.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  Do you remember this, the article in this case?
Speaker 1: Baltimore Sun--I, I have the names of 'em written down over here.  But it's the Baltimore Sun--oh, I can't think--there were so many articles written, I just can't think.  It's Baltimore Sun.
Speaker 2: Now this was--as I said, I enjoyed being in the plays, so this was one of the, one of the actors didn't, didn't materialize, so I took the main role.  And this is one of my first plays, Casino Para--let's see--"Casino de Paris," I think the--"Casino Paris."
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Dr. Samuel Myers [HM], M-Y-E-R-S, and he was president of Bowie State College [now Bowie State University, Bowie, Maryland] and became president of NAFEO, National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education.  All--in other words, all the black universities.
Speaker 1: The same NAFEO group?
Speaker 2: Same, same group.  This one's in Brazil.  We went to Africa, Brazil, Morocco, India, to many places.
Speaker 1: That's the national herit--I won the Black Heritage Award.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  And who gave that award?
Speaker 1: This, this award was given--oh, I think that Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland] gave me that award, Black Heritage Award.  I guess--yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  What was the year?
Speaker 1: I had written (laughter), (unclear)--it's, it's, it's somewhere up there.
Speaker 2: Many awards for the original plays and for other things.  We have always every year a big dinner at a French restaurant.  And there's my associate, Dr. [Carleen] Leggett, along with Florence Obi of first from Nigeria, who majored in French, or who had a double major in French.  And this we were (unclear)--yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, that was on the Queen Mary.  And I won the dancing championship going.  And coming back on the Île de France, I won the dancing championship (laughter).
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: [No picture] I'm pictured there with my daughter and my son, the one I like very much.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: Oh, that's one of, one of my lectures my son came and joined me.  That's about, that was about, about 10 years ago, so that's--subtract it.
Speaker 2: And what's your son's name?
Speaker 1: Same name, Sandye Jean McIntyre, III, Sandye Jean McIntyre the--
Speaker 2: And that's my son, and that was taken two years ago--a year ago.  That was taken in Boston.  My ex-wife [Rosalind Lynn McIntyre] is in--living--she has Alzheimer's disease, and she's living with my, my daughter [Monique McIntyre Brown].  That's my--
Speaker 1: And that's my son-in-law.  He's an engineer, my daughter, my ex-wife, my--that's my first grandson.  That was my, my first grandchild, and that's Ian, I-A-N, and that's my son holding him, so I have two grandchildren.  That's, that's good enough.
