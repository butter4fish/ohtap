Story_ID: 138961
Speaker 1: How appropriate for the day (laughter).  So I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna start with your--I'm, I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side.  We'll start with one side first so, so we don't get them mixed up.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name, her maiden name is Julia Mae Troutman.  Married name is Cherry.  So Julia Mae Troutman Cherry.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her--and, and Troutman is spelled?
Speaker 2: T-R-O-U-T-M-A-N.
Speaker 1: Mae, M-A-E?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born on November 17th--I'm sorry, November 19th of 1927.
Speaker 1: Okay and where about?
Speaker 2: In, in Leslie, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now where is Leslie?  Is that close to Daytona [Florida]?
Speaker 2: No, Leslie is sort of south central Georgia, it's a, it's 100 miles up on I-75, 5, then the closest major city would Albany [Georgia].  And it's about twenty miles away from Americus [Georgia], which was [James Earl] Jimmy Carter's hometown.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right right.  Okay.  Now what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them and what were they doing--what were the stories on that side?
Speaker 2: Well, the--we've done the DNA testing on mom's side and as far as the African ancestry test tells us that she is, she was from the Bamileke ethnic group which is in the Cameroons [sic, Cameroon] in Central Africa.
Speaker 1: Can you spell Bamileke?
Speaker 2: Bamileke is B-A-M-I-L-I-K-E [sic], I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm not, I, I could spell it if I could write it down.  (laughter)  Read you the letters.
Speaker 1: Now this is special because so many people don't know anything about their African ancestors, specifically, we all know that African Americans have had an African root but very few know anything specific.  So are there, are there any--do you--have you done any research on, on the Bamileke people?
Speaker 2: We did some, some, some internet research.  I'm, and I'm trying to arrange a trip to, to that particular area once we can get passed hopefully this Ebola situation that's, that's, that Africa is dealing with and once--even though that that's not one of the countries that's been affected at this point, what, from what we understand, the Bamileke are very entrepreneurial folks.  I would, I would, I can see that on both sides of my family, but particularly on, particularly on hers, very artistic.  They--there's a large, they're, they're I think may be either the majority or the second largest of the ethnic groups in, in the Cameroons from, from the sort of brief research that we done.  And, and since my grandfather was a, was a builder, he was a, a contractor, master carpenter, I can see where you know that that may be something known and you know that was brought sort of entrepreneurial spirit and sort of you know having owning your own maybe it may be something that came over in the family.
Story_ID: 138962
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So are there any, any stories about the ancestors on your mother's side after they arrived here?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my, my--I don't know much about my paternal [sic, maternal] grandfather [Willis Troutman] other than the fact that he was a, a carpenter and, and we have visited actually houses in the Leslie, Georgia and De Soto, Georgia, which is the small town right next to it.  That the houses that he built that, that are still, still standing, so I've taken my grandkids to sort of put their hands on the house and say, "This is something that your great-grandfather built you know during the late 1800s or early 1900s."  He died suddenly.  My mother [Julia Troutman Cherry] tells me that he had a--just dropped dead on the house one day, had a heart attack.  My grandmother [Emma Harris Troutman] had been married and, they had been married as a young girl relatively speaking sixteen, seventeen years old.  And I think she might have been thirty when, when her husband died.  She then had two kids including my mother and my, my late aunt.  And then what happened after that was I mean the, the financial situation of the house was pretty much devastated.  My grandmother didn't have to work while my grandfather was, was still alive, but once he, once he died, then she was forced briefly to go and, and pick cotton in the fields.  And eventually she became a hairdresser there as well as a domestic.  She never got past the--I think the fourth grade was, was as far as she got in the school system, the, the, the deep, the segregated school system in Georgia at that point in time.  And my mother tells me that it was initially it was a struggle financially and but her mother said that she was not going to let the girls work, they worked briefly.  And, and then her mother said that, "I'm just not gonna let y`all chop cotton" which is what they called it and eventually she saved up enough money to put my, my aunt who is older than my mother in a, in a small black private school about thirty miles away.  So she went to boarding school.  My mother picked cotton for a while.  She said it, it was the worst experience of her life.  And, and my grandmother was able to, to scrape up enough money to, to, to prevent her from having to work.  So eventually, both girls went to college.  My mother went to Morris Brown College [Atlanta, Georgia].  My, my aunt I believe was at Clark Atlanta [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], now it's Clark Atlanta.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, so she was able to get them both through high school, get them in college.  Eventually they both got married.  My aunt has a a died in the late '60s [1960s] and she has a family of four kids that are all doing well in Atlanta [Georgia].  My mother had of course three in my family, that's myself and my two siblings.
Story_ID: 138963
Speaker 1: And one of the stories that, that she [Cherry's mother, Julia Troutman Cherry] tells us is that my grandmother [Emma Harris Troutman] just didn't--she was, she was, she was a serious woman.  You know she didn't take any--she didn't take no mess from even white folks at that point in time.  She tells us that she always slept with a gun and a knife in the, in the, in under her pillow.  She said that she, she was not gonna allow any courting so she never had after, after my grandfather [Willis Troutman] died, she never had a man because she thought that if she brought men in the house, that the men would actually be taking--looking at the two girls that she had to raise.  And she said that she didn't want any man to come in and, and have a chance to molest her girls because she'd kill 'em if they did.  She tells us that there is an anecdotic story where my grandmother was working as a domestic.  She was washing, basically washing white people's clothes.  So she, she'd go get the clothes from the from rich white folks houses and then take 'em, bring 'em and wash 'em at home, hang 'em up, iron 'em and then take 'em back folded up.  She said that she went to this white lady's house one day and the white lady had just come out of the shower.  And the white lady came up in a towel, wrapped up in a towel, saw my grandmother knocking on the door, and then opened the towel and said "Emma, don't you wish you looked like me?"  My mother--my grandmother said she got a, a towel that she had washed and folded, wrapped it into a cattail and popped this white woman (laughter) with the, with the towel and told her, "Don't you ever do that to me because you don't dis--because you disrespected me, I'm never gonna work for you again."  And then the white woman was you know ran back half naked, or naked into the house screaming saying that, "This nigger is crazy.  I'm a tell my husband and he's gonna kill you when I tell him."  So my grandmother said "You tell him and you tell him don't knock on my door to do any work for you anymore."  So the--my mother says that the white man came to my grandmother's house, knocked on the door and then basically said, I, I guess he apologized and said and went and basically told his wife that you know "You shouldn't have messed with her but the woman is crazy anyway.  It's your fault."  So you know, said and--but that's, that's sort of the anecdotic story but my grandmother was, she was a serious woman and from the perspective of, of it seemed that the white community sort of respected her because she just, but she just wasn't gonna, gonna be disrespected by anybody.  And I think that's, that's something else that's, that's, that's sort of genetically you know sort of like a DNA in, in this family you know.  We, we, we're serious folk.  And you know we're gonna stand up and, and, and speak and do the things that we think are, are right and we're not gonna let anybody disrespect us.
Story_ID: 138964
Speaker 1: Now, let me ask you what was your grandfather--what were your grandparents' names on your mother's [Julia Troutman Cherry] side?
Speaker 2: Grandfather's name was, is Willis Troutman.  My grandmother's name is Emma Harris Troutman.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you said that the--now how many siblings did your mother have?  Just her, her and her sister?
Speaker 2: Yes, just her and her older sister.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the sister went away to boarding school?
Speaker 2: Yes, went away to boarding school as a, in high school.  Graduated from high school and then went to Atlanta [Georgia] where she was in the Atlanta Uni--in one of the schools in Atlanta University Center [Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Now did your mother go to, to the boarding school too?
Speaker 2: No, she went to Staley High School [A.S. Staley High School, Americus, Georgia] which is a high school in the Americus [Georgia] which is actually where she met my father [Charles Cherry, Sr.].  My father lived in Americus, Georgia, so mom went about twenty miles away from Leslie [Georgia].  And they were in school together at Staley High School in Americus.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, did, did, did your mother ever talk about what life was like you know growing up for her there, if you recall?
Speaker 2: She said it was, it wasn't a bad because they and I know I'm sure that a whole lot of black folks have said this, they didn't know that they were poor.  They didn't know how bad things were.  They understood that white people were dangerous.  They, they stayed on their side of the road.  They understood I think that perhaps life was not as from a financial or from a, from a, from a you know the materialistic perspective, they didn't have what white people had.  But the, the, the community was very close knit.  She said she got anything that she wanted.  I mean she always had money to walk down the street to--they had a little town square where you could go in and get penny candy and you know she could you know she--my mom, my grandma [Emma Harris Troutman] grew her own fruit, food in the, in the backyard.  They had a pump, a community pump actually for fresh water that that was in, in the backyard of my grandmother's home.  So you know she would, they were, they were responsible, they were essentially the water supply for, for the community and anybody could come on the property and you know pump water because they didn't have running water at that time.  In fact, my grandmother did not get a, a running water until I was in college.  So that was in the 1970s.  Before then, we had what's called a slop jar, which is a, a, a ceramic pot that you would use and it was always in the corner.  So we hated as kids going to my grandmother's house.  We would much rather go to my grand, to my grand, to my father's people's house because in Americus, they had, they had plumbing.  They had indoor plumbing.  So it wasn't until I was a sophomore in college that I went to my grandmother's house and with paved roads and indoor plumbing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, but from, from my mother's perspective, life was really pretty good.  Once she, once my grandmother was able to sort of cobble together enough money to get her out of the fields and picking cotton, but she said that she would you know she, she was--her kids, her two daughters were gonna get educated.  And whatever she had to do to do that, that's what, that's what she would do, so that's what she did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 138965
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Julia Troutman Cherry] talk about what she wanted to, to ultimately become you know when she finished school or--?
Speaker 2: You know I, she--(simultaneous])
Speaker 1: --Or, and did she become what she wanted to be?
Speaker 2: You know at, at that time, there were limitations on what a black woman could do.  You could even with an education you could be a nurse, you could be a teacher, you could be a domestic.  You'd always get a job cleaning, cleaning somebody's house.  And as a college graduate from what she went, she went--mom graduated from Morris Brown College [Atlanta, Georgia] in Atlanta [Georgia].  She, she was a teacher.  So she, she was in home economics and then she, she eventually taught home economics in high school and then at, at--once she married dad [Charles Cherry, Sr.] and then they moved to Daytona Beach [Florida].  She taught home ec [economics] in high school there and then finished her career as a public school teacher in both the segregated black schools and then the schools were desegregated in the South and started '68 [1968], '69 [1969] from then she went into desegregated schools and finished up her career.  I think she did twenty-five years in the public school system.  So she's been retired I think as long as she as she's actually been working which was a blessing 'cause my dad [Charles Cherry] was, an entrepreneur, was able to you know keep things going where she didn't have to work you know once, once we got, once we got to Daytona [Beach, Florida] and once the three of us got old enough to sort of you know not eat him out of house and home.
Speaker 1: Now did she have any particular mentors at Morris Brown [College, Atlanta, Georgia] or any stories about Morris Brown?
Speaker 2: None that I was aware of.  I just know that the, the HBCUs [Historically Black Colleges and Universities] were tough.  I mean they, they were, you, you had to go there and you had to get work done.  If you had to work you worked while you went to school and it wasn't easy, I don't think as easy as it is now for, for kids going to college.  Because if, if you didn't get the work they just sent you back home.  You know and that's one thing that any kid did not wanna be sent back home to, to these 'cause they were pretty much all most were first generation college grads or college students.  So you know--I know it was difficult for her that was that--when she was up there so but I'm not aware of, of any particular mentors that she's mentioned to me during her college career.
Story_ID: 138966
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about your father.  Now can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's full name is Charles William Cherry, Sr.
Speaker 1: And what is date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: October 13th, 1928.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Americus, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's the hometown of [James Earl] Jimmy Carter?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: That's right, Americus, Georgia.  And so what can you tell us about the ancestors on your father's side?  How, how far back can you trace them and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: DNA test tells us that the males from the Barlow family which is where, where--what he was which is just sort of the key foundation of his family are, are, are from the Kru tribe, K-R-U, which is West Africa primarily in, in West Nile, Liberia.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And that's another sort of the interesting thing that we find out.  I did that test myself.  He had already died when we decided to do it so.  The, the research that we did on the Kru indicates that they were, they were very aggressive from the perspective of not wanted to be enslaved and in fact would kill themselves rather than submit to slavery.  (laughter)  And it seems that word got around amongst the slaveholders, the, the English, the Dutch at that time, that Kru folks won't survive because they'll kill themselves before they you know.  So obviously some did survive because you know we're, we're here.  But I, I, I, it's just interesting to me when you look at some of the, the, the cultural characteristics generally speaking, some of the folks, some of the ethnics groups that, that, they, they seem to have things that, that have been passed on for--in, in, you know in an ironic way from my perspective any way.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  Kru are very well known in Liberia, you know the Vai and the Kru.  So, now your father is a, is a quite a figure here in Florida history, so I guess we--tell us--well who, who were his parents and how did he grow up?
Speaker 2: His, his mother is Janie Mae Barlow Atkins.  His father's name was Grady Cherry.  I, I don't know anything about the Cherry side.  And I have to take, take the responsibility for that.  I mean he, he began as, as he got older to contact the Cherry family and I met his brother Grady Cherry, Jr. over the years, but we have--we--it's been--we just haven't kept up the, the, the relationship and this is something that--
Speaker 1: Was he estranged from his father at some point?
Speaker 2: --Yes.  His father, he knew--yeah--his, his--he got his mother pregnant and then left.  And I think it took years.  His mother died in I believe in about 1968.  And I think it was after his mother died that he reached out to the Cherry family or the Cherry family reached out to him.  And it took a long time finally before I think he went to New York.  There's, it's a large family contingency of Cherrys and a black Cherrys in New York.  So I know they--he went to a couple of family reunions.  I was either in college or something at that point.  And he, his brother his half-brother has visit--did visit us a few times, but you know, we just never, we never you know sort of leaned toward that side.  So the Barlows are, which are his paternal, the paternal side of his family which are, are the ones that he grew up with.
Speaker 1: We still have--
Speaker 2: The maternal side?
Speaker 1: --yeah, yeah on his maternal side.
Speaker 2: On the mother side?
Speaker 1: Yeah on his mother's side.
Story_ID: 138967
Speaker 1: His [Cherry's father, Charles Cherry, Sr.] mother was a Barlow.  And the Barlows were a large family in Americus [Georgia].  There was a Barlow plantation--
Speaker 2: Hmmm.
Speaker 1: --in Americus and the, the genetic research that we have, have, have done just sort of internally seems to indicate that there was the, that the, the, the key patriarch was a young Barlow man who was, who appears on the slave of the, of the census in about 1830.  So we can trace at least the beginning of and we don't know how or when a Barlow man got from, from Liberia, from West Africa here but we, we see where, where we at least we're looking at probably the 1830s and we can probably do some research to see where we can go from there.  So he grew up as--and, and his, his mother became pregnant as a young girl.  She left and then moved up North, left him with, with her sisters and brothers.  So he grew--he was raised by his aunts in Americus, Georgia.  And the family tradition--here's, here's and here's what happened.  I think that is the key event in my, in his family's history.  At some point in the eighteen, 1880s, 1870s, the family was able to amass about 180 acres to land in, in Americus.  The family patriarch known as old man Steve Barlow had nineteen children.  So of those nineteen children, they, they, they start to leave the plantation.  So folks were going North and going other places in George so on and so forth.  But as the children left, the old man was getting a little older and white people who were, who wanted the land eventually began to take land you know the acreages from the family you know they, they, they, he'd sign off on something.  He was illiterate.  He sign off something, they tell him it was something else when actually it was or they would say so the you know signing documents, 'cause he illiterate, they were taking it, taking it for tax money and so on and so forth.  So according to the family elders, the remaining nineteen got around, got around the table and decided that somebody in this family is gonna have to go to school to get an education.  So of those nineteen, my, my great, great aunt Leila Barlow was selected by the rest of the family including the old man to, to go as far in school as she could.  So she went from, she went to [A.S.] Staley High School [Americus, Georgia].  Graduated from Staley High School from there, went to Spelman College [Atlanta, Georgia].  Graduated in Spelman I think in 1924, '25 [1925].  From there she, she, she got a Bachelors in English.  And then went from there to the University of Wisconsin [Madison, Wisconsin] as a black woman and graduated from I think Wisconsin as a--in 1929 or 1930 with a masters in English.  And then she comes from there and goes to the University of--to, to Alabama State University [Montgomery, Alabama] where she is an English teacher.  She teaches English for forty years at Alabama State University in Montgomery [Alabama].  Then, as, as when she goes back to Americus, the other Barlow kids including my dad [Charles Cherry] who, who are now there, they get together and say okay now that Leila has gone through school, we can now began to put other Barlows in, in school.  So then from the next generation, my aunt Mable who is my, my great aunt who is my, my father's aunt, they put her through school.  So she graduates from [A.S.] Staley High [School].  She goes to Alabama State [University, Montgomery, Alabama] where Aunt Leila is gets an undergrad degree.  Then she goes to Columbia University [New York, New York] where she gets a master's in education in 1939.  She comes--then, she teaches briefly in Georgia, teaches, comes down here in Florida, teaches in Vero Beach [Florida] for a while, goes and ends up with a career in Miami [Florida] where she taught for sixty years in the public school system in Miami.  So by this time you got two generations of Barlows that have been college educated.  So now my dad comes along, his generation.  Now any kid that's a Barlow can now go to college because you got one you know one great aunt his great, great aunt is, is a college instructor.  His, his aunt is a, a, well his great, great, his great aunt is a college instructor.  His aunt now is an instructor here and she--neither one of them got married by design.  So they both and I've seen this in some of the letters and stuff that they saved that they had guys who wanted to court them which is what they call it at that point and time, but they would always tell them that, you know, that's not, that's not in the, in the cards for me.  I got kids and nephews and nieces that are going to have to be put through school. So neither one of them got married.  So one was in the school system for forty years, one is in the school system for sixty years.  Now any Barlow could go to school.
Story_ID: 138968
Speaker 1: They sent dad [Charles Cherry] to [A.S.] Staley High School [Americus, Georgia].  He then goes from there to Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], graduates from Morehouse in 1949.  [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] graduated in 1948 so he was in school with Dr. King at that time, goes from Morehouse to Alabama State University [Montgomery, Alabama] where Aunt Leila is still there.  He gets a master's in accounting and then goes to--from there to the [U.S.] Military in the Korean conflict [Korean War].  Comes out of the military, then goes and teaches briefly at Claflin High--Claflin College [later Claflin University] in Orangeburg [South Carolina], then comes to Bethune-Cookman College [later Bethune-Cookman University, Daytona Beach, Florida] as the business manager at the request of Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune.  So that's sort of the educational foundation.  So by this time of course any Barlow, any Cherry and of us could go to college.  So when I go to college, I'm, I'm a fourth generation college graduate.  And on both sides of my, my mother's and my father's family, we got seven, there are seven of us.  Everybody has at least a college degree and then we've got five of the seven that have terminal degrees, Ph.Ds.  My brother's [HM Dr. Glenn W. Cherry] got a D.V.M. [doctor of veterinary medicine], got cousins that have a Ph-Ph.Ds in, in masters or doctorates in divinity.  So education is something that is, is really a critical foundation I think to the success of, of my family.  But it took three generations for us to get there.
Story_ID: 138969
Speaker 1: Okay, so we were talking about the educational culture in your family and your father's [Charles Cherry, Sr.] going to school.  Now is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: In high school,my dad was--walked twenty miles to see my mother [Julia Troutman Cherry].  And she, she says that her mother [Emma Harris Troutman] would see him coming and, and say, "Here comes that Charles Cherry with those dusty shoes," 'cause he would, he would--she said once my mother told him that he would stop before he got to her house and then sort of you know brush his shoes off and so that her, her mom, her mom wouldn't talk.  So, so and so you know I think he had his eye on her but I, I don't think he [sic, she] was the first girlfriend, but he never told me so.  I don't know if that's the case or not.  But she says that he thought he was--she was you know she had, I know she had more boyfriends and but she thought he was a nice guy.  And her mother told him and she says you know, "If you gonna marry somebody you need to marry that boy 'cause he's gonna be a good provider."  And so she, I think she took her mother's advice and she'll have to tell you 'cause I don't know if it was love at first sight or not or if-(laughter) if you, you have to--you know he had to grow on her you know.  But they, they were, they were pretty much linked up through high school from the time that, from that time until he died, they was so they were married fifty-two years at the time that he died in 2004.
Speaker 1: Okay.  At the time that they got married, was, was he going to school or was he working or what?
Speaker 2: He was in school.  He was actually a year younger than she was at [A.S.] Staley High School [Americus, Georgia].  So he lived in Americus [Georgia], she lived in Leslie [Georgia].
Story_ID: 138970
Speaker 1: Now what did he [Cherry's father, Charles Cherry, Sr.] do for a living when he got started?  I know what he ultimately did, but you know what did he start to do?
Speaker 2: Well he had, he had odd jobs I know in Americus [Georgia] and, and there was a story I think that he told us that he would also say at various functions about what--because everybody essentially had to work during the--in the Barlow family.  My, my aunt told me that the family--I mean, they, they had, a big, it was a big laundromat, a laundra, laundra company in Americus that they were ironing and washing and all the rest of this kind of stuff that, that were there at that point of time.  I think he was, he was probably you know doing that as a--so he worked as a kid and he was a hustler.  He said that you know the guys, older guys would have him running errands and, and you know guys at the pool hall and you know he go probably do a lil, a few little things that probably would be illegal at this point.  He'd probably be put in juvenile facility but he didn't, but he didn't mention that too much.  He just said that you know the guys would have him just running you know doing errands for 'em and they call him Merlot--Merlin.  I said, "Why, why they call you Merlin?"  He said, "Like Merlin the magician 'cause I'd go get something and then they look around and I was already back."  So I think he had sort of a hustler's mentality from the time he was a kid that seemed to bode well as far as you know his, his entrepreneurial activities were concerned as he got older.  So he, he--so once, once he, he went to college [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] and then went to the [U.S.] Military, got into the, the academic track in terms of being an instructor, he was a business manager at Bethune-Cookman [College, later Bethune-Cookman University, Daytona Beach, Florida].  At the time he would--and I think he might have been even teaching classes at the same time.  I know that he opened a restaurant called A College Corner.  I think that might have been his first entrepreneurial venture in Daytona [Beach, Florida] while he was still working at Bethune-Cookman College] because it was a college at that time.  I remember walking back and forth from my house with his dog.  He had, he had a cou--he had twin boxers called--named Chet and David after you know Chet Huntley and David Brinkley.  And they would walk me back and forth from the house to the, to the restaurant.  And so he close--he open and close the restaurant.  He got into--he became a bail bondsman and was was one of the I think probably the first black, one of the few black bail bondsman that could actually get black people bonded out of jail during that period of time.  Then he became a real estate broker and, and opened the first black brokerage in Daytona.
Speaker 1: Good.
Speaker 2: And that, that lasted up until he died for more than fifty years.  So he you know, he did a lot of different things and I think it sort of comes from that, that hustler kind of attitude that he had as a kid growing up in Americus.
Story_ID: 138971
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  He launched a paper called the Westside Rapper in--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --sixty-nine [1969]?  Was that his first paper?
Speaker 2: That was the first paper and that was--I mean it was it was pistol.  I mean 'cause I mean and we, we did a, a retrospective of the Westside Rapper actually in Daytona Beach [Florida] as a part of a historical project early this year.  I mean the headliners will be you know, "Maids are enslaved in Daytona Beach," and you know and this kind of thing because he--it was really our--a, an, an instrument to try to move black people forward.  I mean it was it was radical.  I mean, I mean he was he was part and parcel of a small the sort of local version of the Black Panther party.  And it was sort of the, the, the print outlet of, of that organization which was called the Citizen Coordinating Committee.  So you know dad, I mean he just, he, he just that's what he believed in and he, and he always said that black people in this town need their own voice.  And so from, he started that, that voice from a media perspective with the Westside Rapper.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then Westside Rapper he moves on to establish the Daytona Times?
Speaker 2: Correct.  Daytona Times is established in 1978.  That was the year that I graduated from Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and, and the first issue we printed a week before I left going to law school.  So, and he basically came home you know in January, February of that year and told my mom I was in--my brother and I were both in college.  My sisters still they're going to high school and then he told mom, "We're gonna start another newspaper."  And she's like, "What are you talk about?  You know whose gonna start it?"  "We gonna start."  So that's, and that's what he did.  He just, he, he got some folks, he told, he told me once I came back home getting ready to go to law school, "You gonna write until you leave.  Your brothers gonna sell advertising."  And that's what we, that's, that's what we did.  So he had, he had gathered a bunch of folks some of them who, who had some journalism skills, some of them had who some reporter, or computer skills.  But the computers at that point in time were room size.  So you had headliner machines and all the rest of this kind of stuff.  You had big developing equipment.  And so he bought all that stuff and invested in it.  And so the first issue of the Daytona Times was in August of 1978. And we've been in continuous print ever since.  And the interesting thing is that he never lost a dime.  I mean it made money from day one which is unbelievable to me.  Right now contin--considering what print is, where you got I mean well newspapers are having difficulty.  But back then you know you could still even make money and, and make a, a it was a viable business model to have a weekly newspaper.  And we, so we've never lost a dime from 1978 when they actually started the paper. Which is which is phenomenal.
Story_ID: 138972
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now he [Cherry's father, Charles Cherry, Sr.] goes on to buy radio stations, I mean, a radio station and some other things, but I wanna maybe go back to now just ask you when you consider the personalities of your parents [Julia Troutman Cherry and Charles Cherry, Sr.]--
Speaker 2: Un huh.
Speaker 1: --their dispositions, the way they walk, talk or what they look like, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: On my mother's side I get the height and probably a, a certain amount of sense of humor.  On my dad's side the seriousness and the concern for black, for black people, the love for black people.  And the feelings--'cause my dad wasn't afraid of anything.  And you know I, I find it difficult to shut up some times.  Because I, I--you know my dad was surprised I've said often he was the freest black man I ever knew.  He and part of the freedom was, was he financially, he was free.  And I look back at my life and I see where, where he made a lot of strategic decisions that, that led to that freedom and that in he acted like he was free.  You can't be free until you act like you free.  You know, you, you can't be afraid and always talking about we need freedom, we need freedom.  When, when, when anytime that somebody threatens you or you, you perceive a threat then you go into a shell.  I mean you have to act free.
Story_ID: 138973
Speaker 1: Act unafraid and I, I saw that on a regular basis.  The other thing is I think I get from him [Cherry's father, Charles Cherry, Sr.] is a thick skin with regard to black people.  Black people are difficult.  Particular for if you, if you're, if you're out, out up front.  I saw many times where and my mother [Julia Troutman Cherry] is still is bothered by this fifty years later where when he was, when he was almost a village chief.  So people will come to, "Mr. Cherry I need this you know my kid is having difficulty in school.  A landlord is, is about to evict me 'cause I can't make the rent.  My, I'm, I'm suspended from a job and I need somebody to go and talk to my boss."  You know these kinds of things.  I mean all day all night.  And many times he'd get a phone call one, two, three o'clock in the morning where you got your two kids here, you got your wife here and then he'd get up and do some things for black folks.  But those same black people will not speak to him or acknowledge him publicly as they walked around during the day time.  Because they didn't wanna be seen as having any kind of relationship with this radical you know a guy in this small town in Daytona Beach [Florida] that had newspapers and radio stations and was bonding black folks out of jail and, and was on a bullhorn in front of, in front of a, a, a, a police department saying you know you, you know--that, that you're arresting black people and there's police brutality and we're not gonna stand for it any more.  They just didn't wanna be associated with him.  I think, I listen to Mr. Farrakhan [HM Minister Louis Farrakhan] and he talks about the same kind of phenomenon that you, you stand for the people, you do it with not for self-aggrandizement because but because you have a mission and as our mission here, but the people don't, they don't appreciate it and they--and not just don't appreciate it, they talk to you badly.  They, they bad mouth you, they criticize you.  But you do it anyway because you don't do it for, for, for a pat on the back so he often told us if you gonna, if you gonna get appreciated, appreciate yourself in the morning.--
Speaker 2: I think (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --You get out there and do what you gotta do.
Speaker 2: --yeah, I think you made a good point earlier saying that his independence, his financial independence you know, pursuing entrepreneurial activity--
Speaker 1: Un huh.
Speaker 2: --allowed him to act you know independently without fear of losing his job or losing his livelihood, right?
Speaker 1: There was, yeah, there was it, there was a unit as I look back in his life, there was a unity.  He had, he had one wife.  He had one house you know.  He had one mission that he--you know you, you--he didn't move around.  I mean right now look at--look at our generation. Our generation is well you--before, before the crash of 2007 and 2008 people were jumping from house to house.  And back then folks didn't do that.  I mean, we, I'm, I'm on my second marriage.  You know 50 percent of the marriages in, in America are divorced at some point in time.  He stayed; he stayed married to my mother for life.  So from a financial perspective, that, that and, and I didn't figure this out until really, really late in the game.  That he, he, he, he, he built a house.  The house that he built they stayed in for, for like forty-five years and then when he built his house, he built it where they had apartments.  So, so there were four apartments in, in the house that he built.  He rented three of them out so that means that he was out of debt for a mortgage inside of five years.  So they, so if you don't have mortgage debt, that's the, that's the largest single debt that most, most, most American have, most Americans have.  So now you got three kids, you're mortgage free, you have a, a stream of income from a job that you have at Bethune-Cookman College [later Bethune-Cookman University, Daytona Beach, Florida], you have a stream of income coming from, from, from at least two or three entrepreneurial activities as a broker as a, as a, as a bail bondsman, as a restaurateur.  And so now you can, you don't have to go into debt for anything.  You can do everything in cash.  You can buy a car as cash.  You can buy any, and then so nobody can--so, so, and, and if you just bank that money.  You know you keep your, your, your, your living moderate, then you are free to say and do anything that you wanna do because there, there is no threat.  For instance if he's, if he's advocating for somebody's job at the, at the commercial bank which was there, that bank at--if that bank holds your mortgage at that point in time, these white folks will call your loan.  But you don't, if you don't have a loan.  So you have, you have no control over this man because this man financially is completely independent.  So that, that's, that's where I think from a, from a practical perspective he was independent.  But unlike some folks nowadays who are financially independent and put their heads down and say, "I'm a shut up, I'm a make mine, I'm a put my kids through college, I'm gonna you know enjoy my life and so and so forth."  That's not what he did.  You know he said, "I'm gonna use this because and, and I'm gonna, gonna self-fund everything that I do.  And I'm gonna do it from a strategic perspective particularly as far as media ownership is concerned because we need our own voice."  So he--it's, it's, it's almost I mean right now you can't find in America a many places that have a, an independently family-owned newspaper and an independently family owned radio station in a small town and that is owned by the same group that's not in debt to somebody that's completely free and clear that's owned by this particular family who is now free to do whatever they wanna do with it.  So he used that as a bully pulpit.  I mean in a, and in a small town of thirty-five, forty thousand people that Daytona was at that point in time.  I mean that's, that's a tremendous bull--pulpit and a, and a bull horn that he used to move that community forward.
Story_ID: 138974
Speaker 1: Now, I know you have a brother named Glenn [HM Dr. Glenn W. Cherry], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Is it just the two of you or is it?
Speaker 2: No, I have a sister named Cassandra [Cherry Kittles].  And so it's three of us.
Speaker 1: And you're the oldest, right?
Speaker 2: I'm the oldest.
Speaker 1: And then comes?
Speaker 2: Then comes Glenn and then comes Cassandra.  So we're all eighteen months apart.
Speaker 1: Okay, well tell us a little bit about your siblings.
Speaker 2: Well, well, my brother we, we sort of switched the, the birth order as far as the business is concerned.  He's been the CEO of the various family owned and operated businesses for most of the years that we've had them and I've been you know general counsel and you know sort of manager so we and that's, that's what we did that by design you know.  He, he, he's, he's got the--I think a, a good strategic mind and I feel better and more comfortable and sort of a, a counseling role, because I've been a lawyer for thirty some odd years now and I just feel better you know in terms of giving recommendation, but ultimately, up until the last few years, we, we agreed that the buck would stop at, at his door in terms of the, the, the strategic decision made on behalf of the company.  My, now my mother's [Julia Troutman Cherry] in charge and, and which is interesting because she's eighty-six but she, she's, she's still sharp and but I serve sort of the same function which is I just advise.  And then we, we sort of get together and we make strategic decisions and then and I, I sort of advise and facilitate and implement if necessary.  My sister is a shareholder and she has, she, she has a--moderate kind of, of, of, of you know involvement in the family businesses.  And she, she worked actually outside of the businesses up until about two or three years ago.  So you know it's been a family-owned and operated, truly family-owned and operated for especially in the last ten years since my father [Charles Cherry, Sr.] died you know.  He was, he was the key person for the first thirty, forty years of, of the family-owned businesses and then he died.  And then it's been more of an operation by committee since then.
Story_ID: 138975
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: My earliest childhood memory is coming back from Halifax Hospital with my sister [Cassasandra Cherry-Kittles] as a newborn.  My dad [Charles Cherry, Sr.] had one of these Dodge, I forgot what they were, but these big fins with the big fins in the back and I remember mom [Julia Troutman Cherry], mom with my sister in the front seat you know.  This is before baby seats and required seatbelts.  So she got my sister in her arm, my brother's [HM Dr. Glenn W. Cherry] on one side, I'm on the other.  So that was I was three and a half.  So that's my first conscious memory was, was coming home with my sister.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Three and a half years old.
Story_ID: 138976
Speaker 1: Can you describe the neighborhood you lived in and what were some of the sights and sounds and smells in growing up?
Speaker 2: Sights, sounds and smells?  Daytona [Beach, Florida] was a small southern town and the, the sights, we had--we were sort of citified in sort of in a certain way.  We had paved roads for the most part around most of our, our streets in, in Daytona Beach.  And we had, we had running water.  Of course nobody had air conditioning.  The sights and sounds, well anytime that I hear cicadas and crickets and frogs, that takes me back to, to my childhood because that's what you heard at night.  Of course we had, we had a television.   You had three, three channels.  You had the channel signing off you know with the, with the, the target kind of thing in, and the black and white screen at night and then you had the, the Star-Spangled Banner in the morning if you were up at six o'clock.  And we had a, a, a very close knit community and I, and I often--the last conversation in fact I had with my dad [Charles Cherry, Sr.], was about the unintended consequences of desegregation on our little city.  I had a radio show that I was going to do on the day that my father died, which was November 13th, November 16th of 2004.  The night before I told I asked my dad, I wanna talk about this town and what it used to look like you know and he--and how we would have entrepreneurs up and down the street you know black-owned businesses, you know four-star restaurant.  We had rooming houses, hotel houses--I mean hotel rooms, and boarding homes.  We, we had dry cleaners.  We had gas stations you know.  We had all this stuff of entrepreneurs on two of the main drags and then what you, when you go up and down the street even ten years ago, I mean it's, it's like it was a ghost town.  And so the last conversation that we talked about was what whether the things that he had done in the city really would, would benefit black people, because he wasn't sure at that point in time.  He was dead the next morning.  And what, so when I think about my home town, I think about the teachers and my, and my little elementary school which was in, right in my backyard less than 100 feet away from my front door who, who would have, who could have been anything that they wanted to be right now had they been born thirty-five or forty years later.  But because they were black, women could only be teachers or domestic as we talked about before.  But they were, they were, they were fabulous.  I mean they drove the kids.  They had expec--high expectations of kids succeeding.  There weren't any excuses about failure.  There was no ADD [attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder] or anything like that.  If you didn't get your homework, they call home.  Again, well first they punish you. You held books and you stood in the corner or you know if you were really disruptive, there was a, a, one of the male teachers who is Mr. Goodman [ph.], would take a razor strap and beat you in front of the, in front of the classroom and, and every kid got the message.  And okay you call it terrorism, call it child abuse or whatever you want, but it, it served, it served the, the, it actually served us very well.
Story_ID: 138977
Speaker 1: And so I look back and then, and when I go home [Daytona Beach, Florida], I have to shake my head sometimes 'cause it's, 'cause it's just, it's, you know it's, it's nothing like it used to be and it's not, it's never gonna come back.  But to answer your question, sights and sounds, we would be outside because it was too hot to be inside in, in Florida.  Nobody had air conditioner.  There were always an--in a typical day particularly when you didn't have school, your mom would get you up at eight o'clock, she would cook breakfast for you so those, that breakfast would include, include grits, eggs, sausage.  I mean you go to--what you would get at Waffle House right now you have to pay for it, 'cause mom's [Julia Troutman Cherry] cook three squares a day.  You get your breakfast.  You go outside, you on a summer day we'd go with some kids that lived in the projects.  So we lived in a, in a home of two blocks away from the public housing authority development that everybody calls the project then.  So all my friends were in public housing.  There was a pool nearby.  You, you--at nine o'clock you know you walk around by this time if you walked around the neighborhood, you got five or six of your friends, you go jump in the pool and you know you stay in the pool for a couple of hours.  You get a towel, you dry off, you go back home.  Everybody go back home and eat lunch.  Mom, mom has lunch ready for you.  Then you, you leave for lunch, you go back to your friend's house and you walk around and get a slurp, well not a slurpee, they called them icees then because they were just ice.  You, you walk around town.  There was another pool on the other side of town.  We'd go over there and get into it sometimes a dispute with some of the kids that live on that side.  Then you, you by this time it's three, four, five o'clock.  You--there was another pool that, that was desegregated.  That's how we learned to sort of you know deal with white kids.  And so summer time you just be walking around going from activity to activity and you pick up kids along the way and if you had ten or fifteen, twenty cents, you get some cookies or you get a belly wash, which is a sixteen ounce of Nehi soda.  And you know that's, that was a summer day.  And then you come back.  If you were not back when the sun--when the street lights came on, then your mom would start yelling for you.  "Chuck, come home."  You know so they, she get in the, in the kitchen and start yelling.  And then we--she--is we were coming down the street we say, "Okay mom we're coming home."  And then when you came home dinner would be ready and that's what a summer day was like as a, as a black kid in the South in the '60s [1960s].  No TV, none of that stuff.  At night when you went to bed, all the, all of the windows would be open.  You'd have a hassock fan, a fan that, that, that sits up that's round where the, the wind comes out all around and then you sleep with that fan in the room and you know my brother [HM Dr. Glenn W. Cherry] and I slept in bunk beds so he slept on the bottom I slept on the top, until we switched, we switched sides one year and then he got his room when we went to high school and I got mine.  But it was, it was an idyllic childhood really.
Story_ID: 138978
Speaker 1: The, the adults did a great job of shielding us from racism.  It wasn't until I was early--I was, I was, I was past elementary school that we really understood what racism was.  We tried to go to some of the places that we couldn't go and adults would tell us that we couldn't go.  We still saw colored and white water fountains.  There were, there were department stores that we couldn't go into.  I lived, I'm, I'm born and raised in Daytona Beach, Florida, but I couldn't go to my own beach.  I had to go twenty-five miles to go to the beach, to, to go to Daytona, because black people were not allowed--until there was a, a wade in that my dad [Charles Cherry, Sr.] had put, put me and some other kids in front of the line so that black kids, 'cause they did not believe that the Daytona Beach Police Department would attack black kids.  So we waded into the, the water at Daytona Beach when I was probably ten, eleven years old.
Speaker 2: So this was about 1966?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  '66 [1966], '67 [1967].  And that's how eventually Daytona Beach got desegregated.  Black people had to go to Bethune-Volusia Beach, which was twenty-five miles away.  But the interesting thing was that black folks owned the beachfront property.  They owned beachfront property.  So you, when you went there, there were juke joints.  There were people who had hotel--little boarding houses across the street.  There were, there were folks who had concession stands and so folks would make money that, that which, which went away during desegregation.  And that's one thing that my dad I think as an entrepreneur really just hated the fact that with desegregation and I don't use the word integration, I use desegregation.  America is not integrated, it's desegregated.  Desegregation is a legal term which only means you can't prevent me from going someplace as a consequence of the color of my skin.  Integration means I'm part of your family, I'm part of your, your, of your culture.  We're not a part of this culture you know.  I, I, we're, we're you know we're, we're still, this is not a mix, a mixing pot in America, it's, it's a quilt you know.  Everybody's got you know little things that is American quilt and black America's particularly black southerners have a certain square in American quilt that does not mix with other stuff.  I mean that's just the way it is.  So, so I think black leadership like my dad thought that they were getting integration when really what they got was desegregation.
Speaker 2: No, now--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: And desegregation hurt probably as much as it helped.
Story_ID: 138979
Speaker 1: I have often heard that, that stated by people who though they championed it so-called desegregation, they, they did not you know, they look back and see stronger black community pride--
Speaker 2: Un huh.
Speaker 1: --in that.  But I mean it's a dilemma people face.  Did your father [Charles Cherry, Sr.] stay in touch with [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] or did, did he have any stories about Dr. King when he was a young Martin Luther King?
Speaker 2: Well, he said everybody called him M.L. you know.  He was just another guy and, and he spent as much time at Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] as all the Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] guys did.  He said that he went up to--there was some of the guys from Morehouse who would do summer work at--in tobacco fields, so I think he said M.L. went up, went up one summer you know and picked some tobacco for a while and came back with some new clothes and stuff, but you know he, he, he said he like, he liked--he was one of the guys who liked to dress.  And the, the, the, there are two stores actually that he told us.  Dr. King once he left Atlanta [Georgia], went to Dexter Avenue Baptist Church [in Montgomery, Alabama] which was his first stop in--once, once, once he got his, his first church that he was a pastor of, which ironically my Aunt Leila was the chairman of the, the pastoral selection committee.  So my Aunt Leila actually was the person that welcomed him because she was in charge of the committee that came--that at, at Dexter Avenue Baptist Church and so she called dad and said, "Well what about this King kid?  I mean well tell me something about 'em."  So they had conversations with dad says he had conversations with King said, "Look, my aunt's over there at the church.  I'm a give her the word for you."  And so you know that's how he got in according to him.  And my Aunt Leila never, never told us that story; that's what dad said.
Story_ID: 138980
Speaker 1: All right.  So the second story.
Speaker 2: Second story, dad [Charles Cherry, Sr.] was leaded was to lead a march in 1969 during the Apollo missions.  There was a, there was a real concern about spending billions of dollars for to, to send human beings to the moon when it--when America was having so many problems particular with the--in the '60s [1960s] with poverty and, and, and, and everything else that was going on at the time.  So my father put together a march that was gonna be in 1969 from, from Daytona Beach [Florida] to, to, to Cape Kennedy [Air Force Station, later Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida] to protest I think it was the either Apollo 11 or Apollo 12.  It was before [Apollo] 13.  So I think it was eleven or twelve.  And he had gotten a commitment from [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] that he would show up and help lead the march for a couple of days to protest the, the, the billions of dollars that was going into NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] and the space program at that point in time.  Dr. King was killed on August [sic, April] 4, 1968 as we know. So dad went along with the, with the march any way in 1969.  I think it was January or February.  And so but instead of Dr. King marching, Dr. [Ralph David] Abernathy came in.  So we got pictures of him leading the march from Daytona with my father and Dr. King would had, had he lived would have been leading that march with my father from, from Daytona to, to Cape Kennedy.  I was and I was in that march.  That was one of the first marches that he allowed me to be a part of.  He--
Speaker 1: So you were a teenager then right about thirteen?--
Speaker 2: I was a teenager.
Speaker 1: --About thirteen.
Speaker 2: Yeah you know I was about twelve or thirteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my brother [HM Dr. Glenn W. Cherry] stayed home.  He told him that you know, "Somebody's gotta be here with the women."  We had guns in the house.  So my brother was, was basically say "Hey, look if something happens then this is, you, you could handle the situation, but you know some, I'm not gonna take you, I'm gonna take Chuck."  That's what he called me. "Chuck's gonna go with me, you gonna stay in the house and guard, guard the women."
Story_ID: 138981
Speaker 1: You, you, you spoke about your grandmother [Emma Harris Troutman] you know going to bed at night with a gun and a knife near the bed.  And your father [Charles Cherry, Sr.] you know being armed you know.
Speaker 2: Un huh.
Speaker 1: Are there any stories of actual attacks by--
Speaker 2: They, they--
Speaker 1: --hostile people?  (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: --they, they would have running, running gun battles with Ku Klux Klan [KKK].  The Ku Klux Klan is between Daytona [Florida] and Ocala [Florida] as well as in the back, back roads between St. Augustine [Florida], Daytona and Ocala.  He will go there, bail some folks out 'cause he, he part of what he was doing was he was bailing civil rights folks out.  He bailed--he actually bailed [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] out when he came to, to St. Augustine.  So he tells me that, that there was a, an there was an insurgency of black ex-military guys who are armed and were not non-violent that and particularly, they had a, a one of the dentist there Dr. Halen [ph.] was involved.  And Dr. Halen is still alive.  And they would to make sure that, that, that, that the welcomes could be iden--unidentified, they would take, take the dental drills and take the serial numbers off the guns, but that they, they, there was a lot of, of, there was a lot of, there was a formal ex-military, black ex-military group of folks who were having regular battles that was, that was underground with the Klan.  He said that happened on a frequent basis.  And one thing I think that we, we didn't find out until we were kids was that he built our home as a bomb shelter.  He--there was a bombing in 1951.  Harry T. Moore [Harry Tyson Moore] and his wife Harriette [Vyda Simms] Moore were killed in Mims, Florida which is about an hour north, I'm sorry, south of Daytona Beach.  Dad built our house I think in 1955, '56 [1956] and what they did was with the, with the Mims, I mean with the, with the Moore family was it would sit--the house was, was one of these wooden houses that sat on bricks so there was room underneath and then some, some ex-military, some Klansmen with ex-military training with explosive training essentially roll a bomb underneath the bedroom and, and it blew up and killed them both.  So my dad built, built a house that was concert rebar that had no space underneath it.  So it went to, to bedrock about six feet under and it was custom built.  We--it's, it's pour concrete walls with rebar in between and he built that house essentially 'cause our, our--at that point I think he knew he was gonna be involved in a civil rights movement.  So we didn't know growing up but, but we did have, we've have shootings at the house.  People of turned, turned, come round, around the corner, shot, shot at the house.  We've had crosses burned in front of our house.  We've had the threatening phone calls.  All this happened when, when we were kids.  So--
Speaker 1: Now, the Harry T. Moore bombing I think is a subject of a, a book that just won a Pulitzer Prize [Devil in the Grove: Thurgood Marshall, the Groveland Boys, and the Dawn of a New America" by Gilbert King], I think by--
Speaker 2: Un huh.
Speaker 1: --a, a it's about Thurgood Marshall.
Speaker 2: Un huh.
Speaker 1: --down here in Florida investigating--
Speaker 2: Un huh.
Speaker 1: --the Harry T. Moore incident.
Speaker 2: They, yeah they, they--
Speaker 1: I can't think of name of the book now I've got it at home and I can't think of it.
Speaker 2: --Okay.  It's, it was serious business.  And it was, it was, it was, it, it you were putting your life on the line if you really want to fight for black folks you know in those days.  And that continue to actually til, til the early part of the 1970s.  You know it wasn't until I was in high school that things began to change or and, and then you, you saw, you saw, you saw the system begin to change.  But before that, I mean if a black man like my father well he was, he was a constant target.  And I think again the fact that he was financially independent and then not, not just financially independent, but the businesses that he, he owned and operated were, were supported by the local black community, that's the other thing.  You know you couldn't have, you couldn't be an independent entrepreneur at that point and then have your, your customer base to be white.  I mean 'cause they, they could take you out of business and then again there is that financial control that prevents you from doing the kinds of things for your people that you wanna do.
Story_ID: 138982
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I wanna go pick your story up again in grade school.  Now where, where did you start in grade school?
Speaker 2: I started grade school at Campbell Elementary School [Campbell Street Elementary School, Daytona Beach, Florida], which was a, an all-black elementary school from first to fourth grade.  And the, the, the desegregation activity began to pick up.  It took twelve years of law, I think about twelve years of lawsuits before the 1954 decision, the, the Brown v. Board of Education [1954] and the, and the Volusia County [Florida] School District decided that they were actually gonna desegregate schools.  So my dad [Charles Cherry, Sr.] was involved in that.  You know I, I was one of the name plaintiffs in the school desegregation suit of Volusia County.  And--but it took, it took a, a good decade before they decided, decided to actually desegregate the school system.  And, and the way that they did it was mean-spirited.  Just like it was done around other places in the south which is you just immediately and automatically close all the black schools and that's what happened.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So you had Campbell High School [Daytona Beach, Florida], which was an outstanding school.  Campbell Elementary School, which had outstanding teachers, but rather than look around and then you know look, look at and do some type of logical analysis by looking and evaluating all the schools, essentially what they did was we're gonna take this--we're gonna shut these, these black schools down, regardless of the fact that the kids are performing well.  We're gonna disperse all of the, the teachers with elsewhere in the school system.  We're gonna bus those kids to wherever we want 'em to go and then our--the, the black principals and the black leadership will never be able to ascend to become principals themselves, they're always associates and assistants.  So they dispersed our black teachers and the black students, and, and, and I mean that was, that was probably a fork in the road in terms of, of, of destroy--I mean essentially destroying the unity of, of, of the black community in our city at that point.  I mean it; it was never the same after that.
Speaker 1: And I imagine quite a few people lost jobs.
Speaker 2: Lost jobs.  The, the community began to be split apart.  The school--the teachers were--because it--the teachers were ten, fifteen, twenty miles away sometimes.  You know even five miles away in a city where everybody doesn't have a car and there's, there's limited rapid transit.  So you, you couldn't--the black, the black kid for--for a PTA [parent-teacher association] meeting at, at Campbell Elementary, you got, you got mothers who are in public housing that's a block away, two blocks away from the school.  I'm a hundred, a hundred feet literally away from the school where my mother [Julia Troutman Cherry], where my mother was teaching.  So it was easy for people to be a part of a community institution which is, which is what schools used to be in the black communities at that point in time.  And, and there were only three ele--black elementary schools and Campbell--were and they were all strategically located within the black community.  So, so they were very strong community institutions.  And that's, that's part of the problem with black, black America right now is the weakness of community based institutions.  Our community based, the churches, the schools, you know even the fraternities the soror--they could be, they're weak and they, they I think that desegregation had a point.  Now whether that was something that was intentional or not, I don't know.  But looking back from a historical perspective, desegregation, school desegregation was a, was a, was a major factor in, in the, in the weakness of community institutions and I think in the, in the, and the dysfunction that you see in the, in the black community right now.
Story_ID: 138983
Speaker 1: Now, now how old were you when schools are desegregated then?
Speaker 2: I was, I was in fourth grade, so I was what, ten.
Speaker 1: Un huh.
Speaker 2: Ten, about ten ten or eleven years old when, when the desegregation actually picked up speed in, in Daytona Beach [Florida].
Speaker 1: I mean when you actually had to go to another school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I mean--
Speaker 2: Yes, so, what, what, when, when, my, my, my mom [Julia Troutman Cherry] and dad [Charles Cherry, Sr.] saw it coming, they thought that if I stayed in the system that I would not get--two, two things, one, they thought that, that, that there would be some retaliation against me as a kid as, as I'm shipped out to an all white school with my father doing the things that he was doing.  Secondarily, they were, they were concerned that I would not get the level of education that I was used to getting in a black, in a, in a black elementary school.  So they put me in a Catholic school from which was another issue, a, a predominantly white Catholic school from fifth grade up until ninth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now at Campbell [Campbell Street Elementary School, Daytona Beach, Florida], any particular teachers or mentors there?  And what were you interested in?
Speaker 2: I mean, I had different--I had extreme difficulty in reading.  It, it, and I remember my, my first I gave a, gave a eulogy of my first grade teacher that was called See Jip Go because that's the first sentence that I learned to read.  And it was from the 'Alice and Jerry' [Mabel O'Donnell] reader and my, my teacher was Edna Barker Washington.  And it was Miss, it was--she was Ms. Barker at that time.  Ms. Barker stayed with me.  She, she, she you know she, she used that book repetitively and I, I still remember even fifty years later the, the, the mental click, the, the light bulb going off in my brain when I could finally understand you know and put together the fact that this, this sentence meant that this, that, that the book was, was correlated to this dog that was chasing the ball.  And so the first sentence that I was able to, to recognize was See Jip Go in first grade.  And from that point on, I learned, I mean I love words.  You know I was a writer, a speaker and so and so forth so that, that set me on a journey to become a lawyer and all the other things that I've done.
Story_ID: 138984
Speaker 1: Now with your father [Charles Cherry, Sr.] involved in a newspaper and your mother [Julia Troutman Cherry] having gone to college, what, what kind of literature is coming in the house?
Speaker 2: We, we, they had the 'World Book Encyclopedia.'  And once I learned to read that, that's what I would read.  When they bought it, my--I mean when--what she tried to do to punish me which didn't make sense after a while was that, they, they isolate me and said look go sit in the corner.  If, if there was a book in there.  That's fine.  I was gonna read it.  So she, she said look I had to try to change the, the, the method of punishing you because if I put you--if I sat you alone and said go in the room and sit down.  I'd have to turn the lights off.  'Cause if I come in there, you got the encyclopedia.  If it's a book in there, I'm gonna read it.  So she, the, the way that she would punish me would, would be in isolation with nothing to read.  Now, I, now you got a--now I got a problem.  But so I, I--and I just worked my way through this, through the 'World Book Encyclopedia' as a kid.
Story_ID: 138985
Speaker 1: So, so Campbell School [Campbell Street Elementary School, Daytona Beach, Florida] was just summarily closed down once desegregation--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --hit and so what, what was the name of the Catholic school?
Speaker 2: It's St. Paul's Catholic school [St. Paul Catholic School; Basilica School of St. Paul, Daytona Beach, Florida].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that, that was a cultural shock.  Nuns, Catholicism, my, my, my mother [Julia Troutman Cherry] was a Baptist and father [Charles Cherry, Sr.] was a Methodist and now I'm in a Catholic school trying to learn Catholic doctrine, which I did.  And 'cause my dad said, "Well you, you know we might as well get you baptized so we can get the discount (laughter) for being a Catholic."  (laughter)  So he's an entrepreneur so he's thinking about the money.  So we, we, we were all baptized Catholic so the, the, the, the payment that he had to make to the, to the diocese went down.  But--
Speaker 1: Was your household very religious?  I mean was religion a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: --No, no it wasn't you know.  Dad was, he--you know again talking about the unity of his life you know he was, he was, he was a Methodist you know was always a member of the same church, gave religiously, went there every Sunday.  My mother was Baptist I mean so but there was no overt you know like some, like some folks have it.  You're praying day and night and all the rest of that kind of stuff.  We, we went to church and, and we would always be in one or the other typically but, they didn't, they didn't I mean they didn't press us.  They sort of left it, just a, just a normal part of the family rhythm that you gonna go to church on Sunday.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But you know during the week, there was, there was you pray at meals but that's about all.
Story_ID: 138986
Speaker 1: Now did--were you involved in I guess you were involved in your father's [Charles Cherry, Sr.'s] business from an early time?
Speaker 2: The first job he had me was, was he had a sign on the side of the house that, that Charles Cherry Bail Bonds and it wasn't--didn't have a, a mechanical timer.  I'd have to plug it in at night and unplug it in the morning.  And he gave a couple of dollars for that.  So that was my first job and I wasn't very good at it 'cause sometimes I'd leave the--"Chuck, Chuck you left the sign on all night?"  "Well sorry, dad," (laughter) you know it was like sorry I just--yeah I plug it in at dusk and then before, before I go to bed I was supposed to unplug it, but it didn't always work out that way but?  Yeah he, he tried to groom us but I think like most kids that are, that are probably sons and daughters of entrepreneurship, entrepreneurials, you take it for granted it's not something you necessarily wanna do.  You feel like you got my--you got your own thing this is dad's thing, it's not mine.  You know and you know I'm just--but, but, I, I tell second and third generation entrepreneurials now to keep the lights on for the kids you know.  If you just keep doing it and sometimes they'll come back but it's good to have a family owned business to come back to so that you can write 'cause I'd rather have--I'm, I'm proud of the fact that my brother [HM Dr. Glenn W. Cherry] signs my paycheck you know.  That's a pretty good thing.  You know if, if I--if, if somebody--I don't want anybody else that's a, not, not, a not, that's a non-family member signing a regular paycheck for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 138987
Speaker 1: Now were you involved in any other activities like Boy Scouts and stuff like that or?
Speaker 2: Some boy scouts.  Dad [Charles Cherry, Sr.] was a Scoutmaster.  So you know but, but the camp and all that wasn't my thing.  We did, I, I, I was on the first basketball team in fifth grade so I got into basketball and that was sort of my sport up through, through high school and then track in college.  I was a high jumper that sort of went along with the basketball and actually got to be a pretty good high jumper who was second in the state at the state meet my senior year.  And then from--was, was a high jumper in college all four years at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] held, held the state record there for about twenty--the school record for about twenty-five years.  So, that, so but other than that, you know we were in baseball a little bit but we didn't--the ball was moving too fast for myself and my brother so you know baseball sort of scared us.  It was one of, one of few things in my life that I was scared was a, was a fast ball as a kid.  But at then, again at, at that point, you didn't--I mean the organizer--you don't have to have organized sports like you did now.  Kids would just get a bat and a ball and there's an empty field in my--right behind my fence and we go play what's called roll ball which means you, you hit the balls.  You have somebody pitch, somebody would, would hit the ball and then as long as you caught the ball before it stopped rolling, then you'll get a chance to hit it.  And so you have, you can have twenty-five kids out there with a single ball and a single bat and everybody is probably gonna get a chance to, to hit which is what everybody want to do.  You had the Soul Bowl or the Turkey Bowl which is kids would get out on a field and on, on a Sunday or on a Thanksgiving you, you got, you got a football that you're playing out there and there's no, there's no organization, there's no parents.  It's just the kids from, from the neighborhood and we're gonna go out here and it's gonna be twenty or thirty of us and we're gonna pick a team and then you know you gonna play and then if your team loses you, you know, you get off the field.  Same thing in basketball, I mean as long as somebody's got a basketball, you play three on three til twenty-one and then you know I'm, I'm up with you and then if we, we keep playing as long as win.  So, so kids organize themselves.  And again that just doesn't happen anymore.  And the parents could--I mean it's not like they didn't care but it's like you know my folks [Julia Troutman Cherry and Charles Cherry, Sr.] like, "Who the hell is gonna snatch you?  Nobody wanna feed you.  You know I'm not worried about you getting kidnapped or, or, or, or abused or anything like that.  You know if they got to feed you they gonna bring you back home."  So it's, it's I mean, we, we, so, so as I even prepare for this, we've lost a lot.  I mean a lot from the perspective of, of, of our culture and the things that, that, that we grew up with as, as kids and you know if you are middle class or upper middle class black person, you living in a gated community and you know you may have a GPS tag on your kids and you know you gotta make a play date and all this kind of foolishness, I mean it's just like I'm sort of like jeez, is this--is this what we've come to?
Speaker 1: I guess so.
Story_ID: 138988
Speaker 1: Now high school, where, where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: Seabreeze Senior High School [Daytona Beach, Florida].
Speaker 1: Seabreeze okay?
Speaker 2: Un huh.
Speaker 1: S-E-A?
Speaker 2: S-E-A-B-R-E-E-Z-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The home of the Sand Crabs.  That's, that was my mas--my high school mascot.
Speaker 1: Now this is a desegregated school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And-(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: First black student went there I think in 197--1969 and I got there in 1971, '72 [1972], it was hell.  It was hell.
Speaker 1: Was it?  I mean--
Speaker 2: It was--
Speaker 1: --What was the ratio of black students to white students?
Speaker 2: It was probably ten to one white to black.  And we were the first.  I mean it was a, a small wave of black students that went and, went to and went to all white schools and we, we, we were a small town so there were only two high schools--there were three high schools.  One black that was shut down that I would have gone to had desegregation not just you know had they not taken the tactic of just closing all the black schools automatically.  So there were only two high schools, Mainland [High School, Daytona Beach, Florida] and Seabreeze.  So the kids that I grew up with were split and my, my street was sort of dividing line.  So kids south of where I lived including me went to Seabreeze which was about fifteen miles away.  Kids north of where I lived went to Mainland.  And we were all bused there and I think though as we told our teachers, had we not had a I think a strong foundation in a black community in a predominantly black school it would have been much more difficult than it would have been particular we probably would have been violent.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because it was clear that the, the white folks they didn't want us over there.  We were fighters from day one.  I mean one way shape or form.  We had to fight to be treated fairly.  You had to, you had to fight to be accepted in the extracurricular activities.  You had to fight to get there for extracurricular stuff because again you got folks who don't have transportation.  Now you have to go fifteen miles you know for a, a, a, a conference for a teacher--with a teacher.
Speaker 1: If you're after school for an activity, how do you get home?
Speaker 2: You stayed there.  What they did was they were on split sessions.  So when I got there, the juniors and seniors so the tenth, the, the tenth graders who are sophomores went to school from twelve noon to five p.m.  The juniors and seniors went from seven a.m. to twelve noon.  So if you had for instance I was in basketball, so that mean I had to get to the school early because basketball practice for JV [junior varsity] was at two o'clock.  So I'm sorry, yeah, you see no it was, it was in the morning.  So you had to get there in the morning.  So times--sometimes you would have to take a seven o'clock bus to get to a practice and then you'd have to stay until twelve to go to school from five and then it was a forty-five minute bus ride back.  So you're, you're at school all day.  'Cause your parents are working, they can't you know can't take time to drive you back and forth--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) twelve, thirteen hour days at school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh huh.  And so I mean black students were fighting literally but we I think we had seen how our parents had tried to fight the system so nobody was picking up bricks and throwing them through a plate glass window at school.  You know I, I, I knew how, how, how protest works, you know boycotts, lists of demands you know those kinds of things, you know strategic thinking.  So the kids I think had seen what the parents had done in Daytona [Beach, Florida].  So what the--my, my, my sophomore year, my first year there from at, at Seabreeze, the, the cheerleading, the cheerleaders had decided that they were, that they had already been a tryout and then black girls were not invited.  So you had all white cheerleaders on my tenth grade cheer squad.  The black jocks essentially got together and said that's unacceptable.  So you had key guys who were JV [junior varsity] football players.  I was on the JV basketball team.  We got together and we said that we have a list of demands and one of those is that there will be a new tryout for these black girls to give them a chance.  If not, we will not, we're gonna boycott both football and basketball.  We, we, we went to our coaches.  The coaches then went to administration and eventually they caved in which is basically, we're not gonna play unless you and so what they did, they, they opened the, the, the process again and then so you had four, these four girls who made it and eventually those four girls were our varsity cheerleaders, so you know but it started out--that, that's, that was the first semester when we got to this, to this school.  So you were constantly fighting one way, shape or form.  But one thing that I see, that I saw that we did that kids again today as I'm looking at Ferguson [Missouri], is that there was a strategic thinking with a, with specific goals and understanding how to leverage whatever you have to try to get what you want.  And, and but that's, that's it, it continued that way that whole--my whole three year career at, at what's called then a senior high school.
Story_ID: 138989
Speaker 1: And even going back.  So, so going from Campbell [Campbell Street Elementary School, Daytona Beach, Florida] even to Catholic school [St. Paul Catholic School; Basilica School of St. Paul, Daytona Beach, Florida], you know, I, I had--I was just catching it from, from, from the time that we--from the time that I left that black elementary school man it was, it was just that, you just felt unwanted.  You felt like you know you are always pushing.  Nobody really just respects you for being just a human being.  You know you are a black kid that's trying to push in places where you're, where you're not wanted.  And it was it was a constant struggle from the time that I left Campbell elementary.
Speaker 2: Was there any--did you have any allies at Campbell, I mean, at--I'm sorry, not at Campbell, but at Seabreeze [High School, Daytona Beach, Florida]?
Speaker 1: The same kids at yeah, the same kids that we, that we were all on the same side of town so we pretty much grew up together so everybody knew everybody and, and I think and, and we were able to go to dad [Charles Cherry, Sr.] and say, "What, what should we do?"  And his--so part of, part of what we were mentored by folks in the community who saw what was going on but they left it up to us basically to sort of make the decisions on how we were gonna handle it.
Speaker 2: I was, I was mainly asking about Seabreeze itself.  There was any, anybody who was already there, any of the faculty, or staff that--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: If there were, there were, there were I, I tell you what I saw.  On the football team, I saw a hand full of black--of white parents who I think understood that, that this can't be stopped.  That you can't just--you, you have to make these kids a part of what's going on in this school.  And I remember a lady named Mrs. Lee [ph.] who made it a point that black athletes were being invited to lunch or dinner at her house.  That was a big thing then.  And I'm sure that she, she, she was ostracized from a lot of these folks because this was a, this, this remember now this is a small town, you got two high schools, both of 'em were all white and now you got these kids who, who have been playing basketball on their own and playing football and running track that these white folks didn't even know that we were on the other side because we were, we are also physically separated by a river in Daytona Beach [Florida].  So there's the Mainland [High School, Daytona Beach] which is on the mainland side of, of and then the Seabreeze or is essentially there's a it's separated by the Halifax River which is, which is all white.  And Seabreeze was on the, was on that sea breeze side which is why they called it the Seabreeze.  It was two blocks away from Atlantic Ocean.  And so I think they felt like we were an invaded army and that now these kids have, have had a, have a chance now to, to be all state basketball, football, baseball players, track.  And now you got these black kids who are, who are competitive as hell and skilled.  And now you know you, you are going--my kid was supposed to start and now you got Charles Cherry over here who's gonna be a starter as a junior where my kid or as a sophomore who could have been a starter as a sophomore who is now is a senior and my kid's gonna have to sit, that's unacceptable.  So we find out that there was pressure on the coaches to have a quota of how many, how many kids, black kids that you're gonna have on the court or on the field or on the, on, on, on the at any point in time.  My basketball coach had a quota.  The football coach had the quota.  The, the track coach refused to have a quota.  He told the people, "I don't give a damn who, how, how--I don't care what you say.  These kids are skilled."  And so it was a--my track coach got, who, who just died a couple of years ago, name Richard Epson [ph.] who was also a teacher there.  So there were isolated allies 'cause, who, who stood against the sort of prevailing wisdom or, or the prevailing winds of racism who said, "We're gonna judge these kids by whether they can do the job or not.  And it's simple as that."
Story_ID: 138990
Speaker 1: All right Seabreeze High School [Daytona Beach, Florida], now what, what kind of a student were you?
Speaker 2: "A," "B."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And let me go back to something.  Before I got to Seabreeze, I was, I spent one year at Father Lopez High School [Father Lopez Catholic High School, Daytona Beach, Florida], which was a Catholic high school.  And I had an incident there on my grade--I had always been an "A," "B" student mostly "A's" from, from the time that I been at Campbell [Campbell Street Elementary School, Daytona Beach, Florida].  The first "C" I got was from a biology teach in ninth grade who the first nine weeks I was getting "A's" who gave me a "C" after I asked her daughter to go to prom  (laughter).  And this girl I had been in, I really liked her.  I was in ninth grade.  I was just starting to smell myself as the white--as, as old folks say.  And, and the, the hormones were starting to rage a little bit I think.  And I asked her for, for, to go to prom.  She initially said yes, but her mother was my biology teacher at, at the Catholic school.  When she went and told her mother that I was gonna take her to prom, the mother cussed her out said it wasn't gonna happen and it's not, it's not something you're gonna do so on and so forth.  So I got about a nine page letter from this girl saying that, "I'm sorry, I can't do it.  I mean I know that this is it hurts you.  I like to go, but my parents won't let me.  You know it's, that's the way some Americans are.  It's an old way of thinking but it's nothing I can do about it."  I went and told my parents [Julia Troutman Cherry and Charles Cherry], "I'm done.  I can't take it."  I say because at that time I said you know this is somebody who knew me.  The parents knew me.  I was on the basketball team with their son.  I had been in, in, in school since fifth grade with this girl that I liked.  And by this time, there was also backlash from the black community.  The kids I grew up with who, who felt like now all of a sudden the, the, the Cherrys are all of that and a bag of chips.  They trying to do something you know.  They going to Catholic school so now the same kids I play basketball with are now trying to kill me on the basketball court because I they think that I'm, I'm my, my head is too high.  I told my mother, I said, "I can't take it from both sides.  You know, I can't and I'm not gonna be in this Catholic school where all I am, is a jock.  You know as long as I play basketball for them and then take 'em to win games, then everything is fine.  But you know I can't be an "A" student and if this lady is gonna do this and then, and, and then I go to the administration and there is nothing that anybody does about it, I'm not gonna stay at this school."  Now my father said, "You old enough to make your own decision about these kinds of things."  My mother thought that it was--I was still gonna get a better education in the Catholic school, but I think they talked about it and they said, "Well you know he's gotta make certain decisions for himself."  So they let me, that's how I ended up at Seabreeze.  So and when I got to Seabreeze you know I didn't have any friends there because again there was this, this ostracism from the black kids during the time that I was in the Catholic school and so but I was a, I was an excellent basketball player and when I tried out for the JV [junior varsity] squad in tenth grade, I tried to kill everybody.  I didn't say a word.  I was just you know, just doing it, doing what needed to be done, and made the team.  And then it was make it--it was the athletics that essentially you know sort, sort of opened the door to, to again to sort of make the friends that, that, to let them know that look, I'm still the same kid.  You know nothing's changed.   Y'all knew me when I was at Campbell [Campbell Street Elementary School, Daytona Beach, Florida] you know, yeah I walked away and then I went to Catholic school, but I'm still the same guy and so you know we were able to sort of restore some of those friendships.  But it was, it was, it was difficult.  It was, it was difficult so but I remember--I remember, I just remember not having a friend in the world you know during that--at that point in time where you just feel like you know nobody, nobody want--and, and I--one thing--another thing that stayed with me til the day is that I said I'd never let a white woman reject me again.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So therefore I have never been out with a white woman, never, never looked at 'em again.  Because from my perspective it was like it was your loss, not mine you know.  I'm, I'm--but that's, that's, that's the impact that, that very personal racism had on me at that point in time and I think that even as I look back there was probably a fork in the road from the perspective of you know which is a, which were a joke.  It's not a joke, it's just it's almost a truism where you know black people say, "What'll you call, what'll you call a, a you know black doctor?  You know a nigger.  What do you call a black lawyer?  A nigger."  We call a black boy a nigger which means that you're gonna always in some people's eyes you're gonna be a nigger no matter what you do.  It doesn't matter.  And you know I think that's, that's I think that you know once you sort of embraced that, it's a certain amount of freedom in that because then you understand where some people, not everybody, but where some--the, the perception that some people have about you and then you can move forward.
Story_ID: 138991
Speaker 1: Now did you have any counseling or did anybody talk to you about some of these, these events?
Speaker 2: There was no counseling at that point in time.  If you, you, if, if you talk counseling to a black, to black folks in there, they thought you were crazy.  You had to be crazy to be counseled.  There was no such thing.  And there weren't, there weren't black psychologists.  There were--I mean even now, if you talking about--I mean there's an issue of whether racism in and of itself is considered to be an illness or the impact of racism.  I mean maybe it right now might be post-traumatic stress or something.  But back then, it's just, you just dealt with it.  You know you, you move forward.  You, you sort of recognize that, that was what the deal was and so you, you just you move, you move forward with it.
Story_ID: 138992
Speaker 1: Okay.  So well what kind of academic counseling did you get in terms of where you're gonna go, what your career trajectory was gonna be?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I didn't get much academic counseling because, 'cause they, I mean they, they didn't care.  I mean they didn't, they didn't particularly for a, I mean I, I was, I was looking at either being a doctor or lawyer.  Once I had that--because this was a biology class, so, so but I, I, I think I've figured out around that time I didn't like blood.  So you know being, being a M.D. [medical doctor] wasn't something that was in the mix for me.  But I always like words and from that first grade experience with Ms. Barker [Edna Barker Washington].  So, I, I sort of meandered into journalism and you know audio visual and film and all the rest of that kind of stuff.
Speaker 1: Were you on the school paper?
Speaker 2: Yeah, was on the school paper.  They had an AV [audio-visual] club, of course it back at that point in time they had reel-to-reel video so you know we'd shoot everything and, and you had 35 mm film and 8 mm little, little cameras that they have but you had to develop all that stuff.  So schools didn't have a lot of budget for that so you know and they yeah well so, so I was on the, on the school paper through actually my whole--pretty much my whole academic career from, from college through--from high school through college.  And then went to Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  I actually was a journalism major and then worked in TV for the last two years I was there.
Story_ID: 138993
Speaker 1: Now when you were contemplating college, did you have any doubts about where you were gonna go to school?  Did you al--did you know you were going to Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  It was only a choice between Morehouse and, and Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  And Howard was in DC and it was cold.  So I'm not--I know I was gonna--at that--see that was another--I think you know even those choices were dictated by racism to a certain extent.  I had, I had you know feelers to go to the University of Florida [Gainesville, Florida].  My--but here's another interesting thing is that my basketball coach even when I was MVP [most valuable player] quote MVP and started as a junior among, among other seniors, I had two, so two, two, two years of varsity.  The coach never told us that anybody was even looking at us or even interested in us even though they had look--so we never got letters from anybody and I didn't know that, that, that there were folks that were looking at me my whole basketball career.  'Cause, my, my, my coach didn't tell me you know.  I was, I was a black kid.
Speaker 1: Did, any of the white students get scholarships to play?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they got scholarships you know.  I, I--one, he did have some conversation with me, The Citadel [The Military College of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina] was interested.  That was military.  My dad [Charles Cherry] was trying to get me interested in going to either to one of the military academies.  I'm like, "Dad, the military, that, that, that doesn't quite fit you know.  I'm, I'm a budding black, a Black Panther, I mean you know, you know I'm a, I'm a black liberation.  I'm wearing red, black and green sweatbands on the basketball team and getting into trouble behind that.  The military is not gonna work dad."  So, so no, no, not the military academy, not, not the [U.S.] Air Force you know, none of that.  So I didn't even look at the University of Florida or FSU [Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida] or UM [University of Miami, Coral Gables, Florida].  I looked only at HBCUs [Historically Black Colleges and Universities] because I wanted to be in school with black people.
Story_ID: 138994
Speaker 1: So did--was there anything special about graduation [from Seabreeze High School, Daytona Beach, Florida]?
Speaker 2: About high school graduation?
Speaker 1: Yeah, high school graduation?
Speaker 2: Just, just getting out.  I mean it was, it was, we--graduation was at a dog track Daytona Beach Kennel Club because our graduation was so huge I think it was about 1,800 people and that was one of the biggest facilities in the, in the, in the city because again we only had two high schools and then when you, you, you shut down one school and then you put your black students there, we were I think we were the only class in the history of both of those schools that graduated from Daytona Beach Kennel Club (laughter).
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: So but I mean look I was just--we was just glad to get out.  The first time that I, I spent up, that I, I spent the night out past midnight was my high school graduation the night before, 'cause my folks [Charles Cherry, Sr. and Julia Troutman Cherry] let me have a party in the, in the garage.  I was the DJ [disk jockey] and everything.  And then and I almost got put in jail that night.  I got caught in the, in the, in the Tuscaloosa park which was the park with, with one of my high school crushes and the cop knocked on the door.  We were back in the back seat.  And but he let us, he let us--"I'm like I'm Charles Cherry's son, you know, please don't arrest me" and thank God that he decided, you know, "Okay you graduate from high school tomorrow, I'm a let y'all go."
Speaker 1: Okay.  Fortunate.
Speaker 2: Fortunately.
Speaker 1: All right so--
Speaker 2: 'Cause my dad would have killed me you know.  I'd be better off in jail.
Story_ID: 138995
Speaker 1: Now did you--when you went off to college, and you were--when you were about to go to college, were you thinking about becoming a lawyer at that point?
Speaker 2: No, no that came late in the game.  Actually there--I was, I was, I thought I was gonna be in film or in television.  But I took the LSAT, the law school aptitude test and did well on it.  Just on a--I had a couple of my good friends were going to law school.  They said and I said that sounds cool you know.  So I took the LSAT and then--
Speaker 1: I don't wanna skip too far ahead.  I just wanted to find out if you were--
Speaker 2: No, no
Speaker 1: --aiming for that when you started school.
Speaker 2: Un huh.
Speaker 1: So, so you, you thought you were going into media actually.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Which is where you are as well?  So, so did you work at your father's [Charles Cherry, Sr.] paper during the summer before you went to Howard--to Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Yeah the paper just started, the, the first issue was the week before I left going to law school.
Speaker 1: No, not law school but I'm talking about for high--from high school to--
Speaker 2: High school?
Speaker 1: --to Morehouse.
Speaker 2: Not, not for the, the, the--
Speaker 1: Westside Rapper (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: The Westside Rapper had already closed down at that point.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: It, it had closed down years before.  It was really short-term kind of deal and then he so there was a gap of probably of four or five years from the time that he shut the Westside Rapper down until he started Daytona Times.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when he started Daytona Times he was resurrecting the paper or, or in certain ways, yes?
Speaker 2: More or less, more or less.  I think it it--the tone of it was a little bit less stride and I think that was probably because daddy was strategically I think he was looking at working more inside the system instead of throwing a plate, a, a brick through the window.
Speaker 1: Yeah now, the word rapper in those days meant you know communicating--
Speaker 2: Communicating.
Speaker 1: I mean, I guess it still is today but it's a whole difference--it's got a hip hop spin to it today.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Where people don't understand what it meant back in the days when people would say, "Okay brother let's rap."
Speaker 2: Let's rap, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: We're gonna sit down and have a heart-to-heart conversation.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Yep, yep.
Speaker 1: Right.  Instead of performing on stage that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Correct.  Yeah
Speaker 1: So, so Westside Rapper was like a message from the you know--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --to the people.
Speaker 2: To the people.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 138996
Speaker 1: So, so Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia] your father [Charles Cherry, Sr.], your father's alma mater you're there in 1970--what, two [1972]?
Speaker 2: '70 [1970], started in '74 [1974].
Speaker 1: '74 [1974]?
Speaker 2: Fall of '74 [1974].
Speaker 1: Fall of '74 [1974]?
Speaker 2: Un huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this is a year that the I think the Watergate hearings are going on, on television, right?
Speaker 2: Un huh.
Speaker 1: Vietnam [War] just closed down.
Speaker 2: Right.  Yep.  And, and I you know we breathe a sigh of relief because you know the, the draft had been shut down just a few years before I was still in high school 'cause folks would, fellows were still very worried about whether we were gonna be drafted and going to Vietnam.  So yeah, so, so [President Richard] Nixon was pretty much on his way out.  But there was not--you know our focus wasn't on, I mean we were just focused on the fact that I'm in college and you know trying to, trying to get accustomed to this new relatively free environment and sitting around and watching Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] girls you know day in and day out and trying and I'm trying to figure that whole thing out.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  All right.  Were there any special teachers or mentors that are--at Morehouse?
Speaker 2: [HM] Dr. Na'im Akbar who was then a--in the nation of Islam and was Dr.--his, his name was Dr. Luther Weems then was my psychology one on one teacher and based on being in his class actually I almost selected psychology or psychiatry as a major.  Because he just, he just made it so interesting and then he, he talked about it from the black perspective which was something I mean and that's what I got from the whole Morehouse experience.
Story_ID: 138997
Speaker 1: The Morehouse experience was just, you were steeped in the black perspective which is something that I, I needed at that point and then and then also and then just the friendships.  I actually you know I thought about seriously about leaving Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] after my first semester.  I, I had one of my best friends and my point guard in coll--in high school Percy Williamson went there with me.  What there were three of us that went to, to Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] from Seabreeze High [School, Daytona Beach, Florida].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And two, two of them were two of my best friends.  Both of them were jocks, fellow jocks with me.
Speaker 2: Did you have athletic scholarships?
Speaker 1: No, no, that was and that was the issue.  So we were all, it was need based.  Percy and, and, and here's the other thing.  Percy had a problem with essential, sexual harassment in the, in the, in the financial aid department.  So he--
Speaker 2: Explain what, what happened, what happened?
Speaker 1: --He, he, I mean the, the financial aid person was there and then took afoul that, that, that, that was talking about his money and then came from around the desk and then put it in his lap and started feeling him up.  And he, I mean you know you're a country boy.  You know what do you know about this?  And he came to me it's like, "Man, this is crazy.  Is this what we're gonna expect here?"  It was like, "Man I'm, I'm just as new as you are" so we told dad [Charles Cherry] about it and I think he went to the administration and I don't know whatever happened with that 'cause again this is not something that, that you know I was still a young kid from his perspective.  So you don't have conversation about what happens in these kinds of things.  But and then Percy I think made that was part of the decision and then also he wanted to play basketball.  Morehouse did not have open athletic tryouts at that time, at least for basketball.  So you had to be sort of preselected when you got there.  He wanted to play.  I wasn't interested.  So between that experience I think he was sort of torn 'cause it, 'cause it, cause--and so I remember him writing a, a letter to my dad sort of quoting Henry David Thoreau that he had--which was a class that we had taken.  [Laughter] an English class we had taken as freshmen at Morehouse where every man has essentially walked to the beat of his own drummer 'cause you know so that's what he wrote a letter to my dad 'cause my dad helped get him in and he knew that, and, and I think he was a bit of a mentor to, to Percy.  He knew my dad was gonna be disappointed.  So long story short, he ends up going to Bethune-Cookman [College, later Bethune-Cookman University, Daytona Beach, Florida] on an athletic scholarship and did well.  You know came out, you know did his thing.  But he told, he always told me that that, that first semester at Morehouse he was much more advanced when he came into Bethune-Cookman just based on that single semester at Morehouse.
Speaker 2: So the academic stand is [unclear] [simultaneous]
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  So the academics did him well and he did, he did well--he could have, he could have, he could have survived.  He could have done well at Morehouse.  He could have graduated if he wanted to.  But I think he just wanted to play college basketball and, and the fact that there was, that the team was pretty much selected and we 'cause we all thought that well you know, you got a new class here. Your basketball guy who is also the athletic director is gonna say, "Okay, everybody that thinks they can play we're gonna have a two or three day tryout and see what you got."
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's, that's not how it worked there.
Story_ID: 138998
Speaker 1: Now what did you--I guess what did the classes of [HM] Dr. Na'im Akbar teach you or reinforce in you?
Speaker 2: Well, what, what he taught, what it--I think the thing that he said look the first day he said that if-- "I'm a tell y'all what the white folks are teaching you about psychology.  There's a, there's a Jungian side and, and, and, and of, of, of what it's all about and then there's a Freudian side," and he went through all the terminology and basically taught, taught, and then basically told us it was bullshit.  And then here's if you really wanna talk about what is the, the human mind, here's what you need to start with.  So that was, that was the first, my first day of college and I was too--I was clued in from that I'm like okay I'm in the right place here.  Because I want, I want somebody that's, that's not--I don't want somebody that's gonna teach me something by rote that's gonna be said, say hey--so he says, "I'm gonna give you everything that, that the, that, that, that this industry, this, this, this discipline says you should know.  So don't, don't worry about that.  But let's talk about where this sort of hits the road with regard to black people and the mindset of black people, and the problems of black people and the pathology of black people.  And we're gonna,"--and that's so, so he laid that out for us from the first day and that, that is something that, that stuck with me and I you know I said you know what and, and then at that point, that point in time there was a very active Association of Black Psychologist [ABPsi] where you had folks who were enable--they call it ABPsi who were trying to come up with almost a separate understanding of the impact of American culture and racism on the minds of black people.  And so they were coming up with a whole, with a whole sort of philosophical structure and he was deeply involved in that.  And I thought you know maybe this is something that you know I can get involved with on a ground level and you know sort of on this try to help black people to try to deal with some of the psychosis that we deal with that's not, that's not in, in, in any of the you know the DSMs [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders] or any, anything like that.  And, and so that, that I mean that, but that was essentially my first day at Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia] and my first class.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was, and, and, and as I look back on, on my, my educational history or experience, a lot of my classes were very similar to that.  You know it's like--it, it's not like we're gonna--we're going--we're not --that you're not gonna come out of here with an understanding of what you would normally get at the University of Florida [Gainesville, Florida] or [University of] Georgia [Athens, Georgia] or [University of] Mississippi [Oxford, Mississippi] or [University of] Alabama [Tuscaloosa, Alabama], we're gonna give you that.  But we're gonna, we're gonna put something else in you that's so that you come out of here thinking strategically and logically about how does this fit into our lives as black, as black men and as, as black people.
Speaker 1: Now did you go to any of the conferences that was you know facilitated in the black colleges?
Speaker 2: Over the years, I did.  Un huh.  And after--but I you know, I, I think I was just more interested in, in the media side you know.  The, the--so, so even though I, I, I look at that as sort of a--I could have gone either way actually.  And my--as I, as I was growing up, I'm a, I'm sort of a, a smorgasbord kind of person.
Story_ID: 138999
Speaker 1: You were talking about your career trajectory in college you're majoring in journalism even though you were greatly influenced by psychology.
Speaker 2: Greatly influenced by, by psychology and [HM] Dr. [Na'im] Akbar but decided to go ahead and, and just make the media the main career and so we went over to Clark [later Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  All of, all of the media folks at, at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] actually were taking classes at Clark.  And which was a great thing because they had a top notch journalism, you know journalism and, and broadcast school there.
Speaker 1: Who was in charge of that?  Or who was the main influence over there?
Speaker 2: My main influence was Nellie Dixon who was the, the journalism instructor and we had a, a Herb Eichelberger was over the, the, the broadcast school.  And what happened was at that point in time, this was, this was, this was early in, in TV broadcast with regard to having black folks as part of, of, of there was a, there were issues in the TV in, in the TV industry in Atlanta [Georgia] because they had maybe one or two black, black reporters.  And so we were told folks from--in journalism at the AU Center [Atlanta University Center, Atlanta, Georgia] so that was Morehouse, Clark, and Morris Brown [College, Atlanta, University] and Spelman [College, Atlanta, University].  We, they had a conference with those of us who were in journalism and broadcast and said, "all right we are going to take some of y'all 'cause and y'all gotta be top notch because we have told these white folk that we have some, some kids over here who can get the job done.  We're gonna put, put some, we're gonna put some of y'all in some internships in some of these stations over here and here's what our expectations are of you.  You will do well.  If you can't do well, you know you're not gonna embarrass the AU Center, you're not gonna set this project back so tell us right now if you're not gonna be able to get it done."  So I was one of those who volunteered and they, they gave me an internship at WAGA-TV which was Channel 5 in Atlanta for my last two and a half years at Morehouse.  And that was, that was a great experience.  I was a sports producer.  On the weekends I did a certain part of the six o'clock news.  So I wrote and produced small sections of the six o'clock news and 11 o'clock news on some week days and on the weekends.  And they put me with Bill Hartman who was a guy who was a, a sports guy who's been there probably thirty years.  And I, I functioned well.  And [Bill] Hartman says I was the best intern that he had.  He was hating to see me go but I tell you what happened?
Speaker 1: What?
Speaker 2: I decided to take the law school aptitude test my senior year did well on it.  Again on a humbug decided to apply to the University of Florida.  University of Florida came back with a full ride of, of grants not, not loans but grants and told me if I came that they, they'd make sure I got a grant as long as I could make it through the first year.  So I decided to go to law school and not because, because of the money and at that point in time again, the University of Florida [Gainesville, Florida] was under the Consent Decree so they had to have black students.  I knew I was gonna be coming back to Florida I figured that a law degree would probably be a pretty good thing.  So I accepted that.  But before I decided to actually go I had a conversation with the, the station manager because they offered me a job.  So I, I was when I went to the meeting with the station manager, I expected that he was gonna say, "Well Charles you done a great job, you're, Bill Hartman, your boss likes you.  You know the six o'clock news, the major producers like you.  You know you done a great job.  Gonna put you on salary X amount of dollars and you got a great career here."  Well, he, what he told me was, "That what we're gonna do, we're gonna give you forty hours, but we're gonna extend that at the minimum wage that we're paying you as an intern right now."  And I, I, I was flabbergasted.  I was like, "I'm sorry, sir, but I worked here two and a half years.  I done an excellent job as you, as you have told me and are you saying that I have a forty hour job but that even with a college degree and two and a half years of experience at this station, that I'm only gonna make minimum wage?"  He said, "Yes."  I was done.  That was my media career.
Story_ID: 139000
Speaker 1: Right, eleventh, eleventh largest media market and I'm doing as a student, I'm doing production on a CBS affiliate as a, as a sophomore and as a junior at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  And then I mean I took it as a serious slap in the face that I'm only going to be making minimum wage but I'm gonna have a fulltime job at making--and doing forty hours.  And so I, if and my thinking was if I can't depend, if I can't depend on you seeing the value that I bring to this organization, as I'm coming in right now, how can I depend that, that you're going to promote me and pay me what I'm worth in the future.  So, as, as a, as, as the child of, of, of, of an entrepreneur and a, a second, a third generation entrepreneur, I said, "I'm gonna bet on myself.  So I'll, I'll invest in the education and because I'm going back to Florida I know I'm--that's where I'm gonna live my life God willing.  And a law degree is always gonna be a good thing to have.  Even though I don't even know I don't know what I'm gonna do with it."
Speaker 2: Hmmm.
Speaker 1: So that's that, that, leads me to Gainesville, Florida at University of Florida.
Speaker 2: Now I wanted to ask you about, I was trying to ask you about the, the Morehouse paper before we get completely off of that.  Can you--you worked for the paper the entire time you were in (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Yes, I worked for the, for the Morehouse Maroon Tiger which is the school newspaper.  It, it, it was, it was in and out and up and down, off and on I mean.  It--we didn't, we didn't, we, it, it, it just wasn't a serious endeavor for the most part but I, I, I put that probably on the, on the--to the certain extent the administration.  So you--we, we wrote whenever, whenever they told us it was gonna come out.  But and, and but there were, there were a lot of other outlets that we could write for in the AU Center [Atlanta University Center] and but I think the most important influence on me as far as my writing career even right now was Nellie Dixon who was my journalist major, my, my journalism, my instructor because she was a drill sergeant.  I mean you would get your papers back and at that point in time you, you only typed.  She said "look, I'm a get y'all ready to work in newsroom.  You're not gonna write stuff in, in long hand on, on legal pads, you will type.  And if you don't learn, if you, you, you, if you don't know how to type, you better take a class."  I had taken a, a typing class in--at Seabreeze [High School, Daytona Beach, Florida] because I thought that I would need that.  As well actually as a home economics class at Seabreeze 'cause I thought I was gonna be single for a while, I need to learn how to cook.  So but Ms. Dixon, I thought I was a writer until she got a hold of my stuff and she, and it will come back home bleeding I mean with red ink.  And she would always address us as Mr. Cherry or Mr. So and so or Mrs. So and so it was very formal.  But she, she was a stickler for detail.  And I think I got that from her in terms of how I, how I run our journalism and our newspaper.  I mean the--her, her training and teaching as well as my legal background, you gotta get it right you know.  You gotta put the extra effort in.  You have to make subject and verb agree.  You know you can't have a, a major flaws particular on the front page and that's what dad [Charles Cherry, Sr.] and I would get really upset--I get upset with him about that.  Because he looked at it as essentially a media outlet as a rapper you know, as a, as a conversation.  And so if the subject and verb okay we can, we can live with that.  We can live with a misspelled word in a, in a headline on your lead article.  I'm like, "Dad, man, come on man."  You know and it's like so we go back and forth about that when he and I would work together on both papers to the point where I said, "If it's not gonna get better take my name off the masthead."  And he said, "Okay fine."  And he did.  And but the, the, the Morehouse experience through Ms. Dixon and that mass communications department where they just you know made you go further than you thought you could because you already thought you were good was a great, great experience for me.
Story_ID: 139001
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Great experience for me.  So between that and looking back at my Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] experience, the academics were fabulous.  The social atmosphere, I'm a member of Omega Psi Phi fraternity so I and I pledged at Psi chapter Morehouse where Dr. [Benjamin E.] Mays founded the chapter.  You know we had a great group of guys there including guys who were Phi Beta Kappas and you know academicians.  The Morehouse College track team with Ed [Edwin] Moses--I mean I was surrounded--
Speaker 1: I didn't even mention that.  Now you told me that before we got started and you went to school and you were on the tract team with Edwin Moses--
Speaker 2: Un huh.
Speaker 1: --one of the great track stars of this century so--
Speaker 2: Un huh.
Speaker 1: --tell us something about that?
Speaker 2: Ed was just a, he was a outstanding athlete in every way shape or form and one of the smartest guys I know.  When, when we got there, we were--my freshmen year we were in, we were in between coaches.  Our, our coach was there for the first semester and, and Ed was already on the team and then the coach left and then we didn't even have a coach my second semester which is actually during the track season.  So we had a volunteer coach, Reverend Jackson, who came in and then Ed was running everything.  Ed was running a 110 high hurdles.  Ed was running a quarter mile.  Ed was running the two--what was in the 220 which the 200 meters and excelling in everything, but the Olympic tryouts were coming up and I think Ed got together with Reverend Jackson and decided that if we really wanna try to make the Olympic tryouts, you need to focus on something.  And so they decided it--I think jointly to focus on the four or what's now called the 400 meter hurdles.  And Ed's a year ahead of me.  I was a freshmen and, and I had been a high jumper at Seabreeze [High School, Daytona Beach, Florida] coming out of and placed second in the State.  And so I was sort of coaching myself at that point, but I, I jumped six feet eleven inches as a freshmen at Morehouse before I start having knee problems.  So Ed and I would, would also that was, that was enough to qualify for the upcoming Olympic tryouts.  So, but still I didn't have a coach so you know I sort of wondered around on my own.  We, we did, you know we drove ourselves to meets and so on and so forth.  Ed was still doing--running everything and then the next year comes around and, and so once Ed decided that he was gonna go and try to qualify for the 400 meters, that's what he did.  And he, he, he broke the race apart.  You know he's a, he's a, he was a physics major.  So you know you, you do physical calcula--he was a physi--combination physically engineering because he was in a dual degree program.  So you use what you have to figure out how many steps it's gonna take.  He, he was always a beast in terms of training so he, he, he, he was--we were running cross country and stuff and, and so he decided that he was gonna take a scientific and irrational approach to this race and try to understand and break it into component parts and sort of focus on those component parts so that he could get the time down as low as possible.  And that's what he did.  And, I--all, all I can say is the rest is history.  But he was the smoothest running guy that I ever saw.  He, he never broke stride as he was running either a 200 or a 400.  He always finished strong.  And he was a, and he was a great guy off the, off the track.  I mean I can't tell you some of the conversations that we had or some of the things that we did together, but you know he was and, and to be in that kind of greatness is in, is in fact an, an inspiration and that, but that's what we had at Morehouse at the time.  You had great guys, great friends, you had great instructors, you had a great social environment with some of the most outstanding black women on a planet who were smart, who were beautiful, who were, who were focused on what they were doing over at Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and at Morris Brown [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and at Clark [University, later Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  I mean it was just; it was a great time to be there.  You know, I, I and one of those (unclear) that's, that's probably one of the best decisions that I made in my life is to go to Morehouse College coming from the background that I did.
Story_ID: 139002
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So now University of Florida at Gainesville [Florida] right?
Speaker 2: Gainesville [Florida].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Culture shock from Morehouse [College], Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 1: 1978?
Speaker 2: 1978 all black, small, you know everybody to the University of Florida 35 to 40,000 students, all white, majority white, large classes and alpine rooms that you have my first class I had 150 people in it.  You do, you, you didn't know the language.  Had never you know my, my, my experience with the law was watching Perry Mason.  I said I can do that.  I can make somebody fess up at the end of the--at, at trial.  Says, "Oh, I did it.  Charles, I did it."  So it was difficult culturally.  I mean every, every other weekend I was back in Atlanta 'cause I--it was difficult to, to cut the tie from between Atlanta and going to Gainesville.  Gainesville was a small town Atlanta, big metropolitan city at least from a, from a country boy's perspective.  And then my white classmates let me know that I was not wanted there.  And they let all of us know.  It was about; it was about, about ten, ten blacks in the--in my first class of about 150 in my first class.  Now the, the class itself was about 300 people so you might have between the, the two classes of you have a maybe 300 folks in class, you got about1 fifteen black people.  And I remember my first, my constitutional law class where a white girl raised her hand and said I don't understand why the black students are here when affirmative action you know they only got here by affirmative action and that means essentially, that, that they are not--they did not qualify to be here.  So this, this, this came up.  This was when we had, when we started talking about equal protection and so on and so forth in my constitutional law class.  So I had [unclear]--that was the first, the first academic difficulty I've ever had in my entire academic career was my first semester at, at, at the University of Florida in law school.  And it was twelve hours a day you know and, and it was, it was just a grind and then you did this and it was like learning a separate language because the law has its own jargon and if you have not been exposed to it in any way shape and form is like really learning a new language.  So you had to put--I was putting eighteen hour days in and I was driving--riding a bike you know six miles back and forth to campus and so on and so forth, but at that time you know it wasn't a big deal but it was difficult.  At my--but I made it through first semester.  Second semester I, I heard that there was free money, grants that were being given out to students in a, in a JD MBA program.  So I decided to apply for that.  The M--and again not having taken a business class at Morehouse, I--but I needed the--actually rather than having a loan I, I, if I could get the free money to subsidize the education, I'm a do that.  So I took the, the Graduate Record Exam, the GRE, did well 'cause I've always done well on those kind of subsi--standardized tests and was admitted to the University of Florida, master of business administration with the J.D. my second year of law school.  And that's when all hell broke loose as far as the academics are concerned because now I'm in a graduate level program where I've gotta keep a "B" a "B" level to get out but I'm with people who have come out of University of Florida or [University of] Miami [Coral Gables, Florida] or whatever who have engineering degrees and finance degrees and accounting degrees and statistics degrees.  And I have a journalism degree from Morehouse College.  And it was, I was catching it, I was flunking exams left and right and I, I remember that I, I for the first time I cried about an exam as a second year student after flunking a test in, in accounting that I had really studied for and I couldn't get it.  So then I decide I had to just throw everything away.  I say I gotta start afresh, I gotta come up with a system that's gonna, that is going to help me to get past and pass these classes because otherwise I'm gonna flunk out of here which would be an extremely embarrassing.  I have to go back to my small town where people know I'm here and then say Charles Cherry flunked out and it wasn't gonna happen like that.  So I start doing research.  Time management, goal setting, memory system, so on and so forth put together a system and then long story short that's now I got through the University of Florida and with both a master's degree in, in business and a law degree over the course of took me four and a half years.  And, and what I did with that understanding was I wrote a book about it called 'Excellence without Excuses: A Black Student's Guide to Academics Excellence' [Charles W. Cherry II] but it comes out of my experience of flunking out almost after coming out of Morehouse and having to retool my academic learning structure and to get through that program and pass the bar exam.  So that's, that's sort of what I did.
Story_ID: 139003
Speaker 1: Well, what, what kind of guidance did you have in this regard?  Was there any, anybody you know in authority that, that was able to advise you or guide you--
Speaker 2: No guidance.
Speaker 1: --or did you turn to other people that you knew?
Speaker 2: No guidance other than the other students themselves so you had--you--the black students in those environments cling to each other.  And so the generous speaking is very difficult to have for a black student any way at that point in time, it was almost impossible to have any kind of relationship with an instructor.  They, they, they, they when you ask questions, they refer you to a book or refer you to a library or something like that and, and what we--but we did what we did have was tutors.  So I, I had some of the best tutors but they were all black tutors 'cause there were, there were, there was a Black graduate organization" on the undergrad side and then on the law school side there was the black students BALSA which is the Black American Law Students Association.  So between those two organizations you know the black students sort of clung to each other for mutual support and then you were able to get some of the tutors and what not that you needed to help so, so there were ment--they were formal and informal mentorship relationships within the black organizations themselves.  And without those man I would not have I really I would not have made it especially on the law school side because you, you, we, we had enough there were enough more experience you know year two and year three students who had an understanding what, what you needed to study and how you needed to do it and it would, it would carve out some time to help you.  Same thing only and I had, I mean I had some African brothers who were so tight on the undergrad side, I mean guys from Nigeria and from Ghana that helped me through the statistics, the accounting, the Bayesian analysis and all these other kinds of hard numbers that I just you know as a, as a qualitative kind of person come out of a journalism major that I had just difficulty with the, with the, with anything that was, that was, that, that was numerical.  So you know with, I couldn't, couldn't have done it without, without the blacks--the black my fellow black students.
Story_ID: 139004
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So you graduated in 1982?
Speaker 2: Eighty-two [1982].
Speaker 1: Eighty-two [1982] all right.  So, you got a dual degree now.  It seems like the world is wide open for somebody with a dual degree.
Speaker 2: Well, at that time you had to make a decision whether you gonna go to law or to business.  And I chose the law.  You know once again, you know I looked at working for some, some I had some, some, some queries from some big eight accounting firms and now you know that, that didn't float my rim--I'm not going to an accounting firm you know with a, with a journalism background and an aversion to a certain extent to numbers.  So and nobody knew what to do with both degrees at that point.  So you weren't, you weren't on a management track event for, for a, for a fortune 500 company.  It's like so that nobody was paying you for one or the other.  They were only paying you for one or the other so I had a conversation with the great Gwen Cherry [Gwendolyn Sawyer Cherry] who was the first--I think it was the first female black state legislator in the State of Florida who is also an attorney.
Speaker 1: No relation to you?
Speaker 2: No.  No, relation actually, it was a good friend of my father's [Charles Cherry, Sr.] but no, no relation to us that we were aware of.  So Representative Cherry said, "If you're gonna go get in the law, then go to be a prosecutor; don't be a defense attorney you know.  If you're a prosecutor, you can control what goes on in the courthouse."  And so that's what I did.  I applied for jobs in Tampa [Florida], Orlando [Florida] and, and Fort Lauderdale [Florida].  Fort Lauderdale took me first and then I had a black men--another black mentor who was a black prosecutor so I came here in Fort Lauderdale in 1982 right after I passed the bar.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So what was your--did you--were you a city prosecutor?
Speaker 2: State, state prosecutor.
Speaker 1: State prosecutor?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: With--
Story_ID: 139005
Speaker 1: So first day I remember vividly.  They gave me a box of about fifty to sixty case files and they just said go do the job.  I walked down to the courthouse and then looked to my right and then there were, there was a jury that you know it was like you know pews here in the church.  There were a bunch of guys sitting handcuffed in the jury box.  And I asked somebody well what are they doing there?  They said well they the defendants and so they, they put six of 'em at a time 'cause you have at, at that point they had like twelve, twelve seats, two rows.  So of the six, six guys that were sitting there, four of 'em were black and then three of them may have been under the--about the age of twenty-five about my age.  And that, that's, that, that always sort of stuck in my head and then as I got further my prosecutorial career and I began to sort of look at, look at some of the presentence investigations, you know you find that most of the defendants were black.  Most of them had, had problems with school you know.  And, and it wasn't that they were not smart it was that they had difficulties in navigating through the, the school you know, the, the system, the academic system and the educational system here which took me back to my experience at the University of Florida, which is why I, I wrote--finally wrote the book two years after, after two years or so after I got through the State Attorney's office.  You know and, and so I, so I put that experience together and then wrote this book really to try to assist young blacks, black kids to try to understand how they can navigate through this education system and, and succeed.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.  So how, how is the book received?
Speaker 1: Well I mean I wrote in 1992, '93 [1993].  It was doing great then 'cause I was pushing it.  And I mean I was everywhere and I mean I--but I got bored with it after a while and then we got into at--and then we took a, a, a detour to get into the media business.  Dad [Charles Cherry, Sr.] had had--so I was out from like 1992 to about 1995 doing seminars and speeches and everything on and, and then dad was still running both the news--newspapers.  So he had this at this point Daytona Times, the Florida Courier and the radio station.  And was making money and having a good time.  So my brother [HM Dr. Glenn W. Cherry] and I, he--we looked at what we were doing and we was like man let's try to go into the media.  Dad is having great time he making money.
Story_ID: 139006
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --So, so soon after that, I, I dropped the book ['Excellence Without Excuses: The Black Student's Guide to Academics Excellence'] and then had, had you know at, at after I wrote the book I also practiced law for a while.  And, and then Glenn [HM Dr. Glenn W. Cherry] and I decided we were going to try to start buying radio stations.  That's how we got started.
Speaker 1: Well I wanna back track a little bit.
Speaker 2: Yelp.
Speaker 1: 'Cause we skipping over some, some stuff.  Now, now in '78 [1978] the year you came out of Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia],--
Speaker 2: Un huh.
Speaker 1: --your father [Charles Cherry, Sr.] started the, the Florida Courier, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: This is state wide?
Speaker 2: No, no the Cour--the Daytona Times was in '78 [1978].
Speaker 1: '78 [1978] Okay.
Speaker 2: He started the Courier I think in like '86 [1986], '87 [1987].
Speaker 1: Okay.  '86 [1986], '87 [1987].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  I see.
Speaker 2: And then the Florida Courier was, wasn't gonna stay, it was only for Fort Pierce [Floria] which is that's St. Lucie County [Florida].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Once he died in 2004, we extended the Florida Courier.  The Florida Courier became a statewide paper in 2006.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So he ran--he had two small independent papers.  They was running out of Daytona, but and, and then, when, when he--so he ran them with the, with the radio station in Daytona.  He dies in 2004.  We said, "The, the Courier is too small."  So we, we at that time we had, we had, we had, we're used to running an eleven station radio group over three states so we can't run a small paper in a small town so let's, let's think big.  So what we did was that's when we launched a statewide two years after he died.
Story_ID: 139007
Speaker 1: And I wanted to ask you about Dr. William H. Lindsey.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He was a mentor of yours, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  He, he was, he was a mentor, friend, he was a client.  He would, Lindsey was one of the smartest guys that I knew with regard to public housing.  Long story short, he was a, he was a, a hippy who was a, who was I mean a peace corps volunteer who came back to America after serving I think in, in Africa.  And he looked and, and was, was, was frustrated with the, with system you know just like a whole lot of folks were coming out of the '60s [1960s] at that point and here in Fort Lauderdale [Florida], Lindsey started a boycott against the conditions in public housing and he threw garbage on the City Hall and so on and so forth.  He was doing that kind of non-violent kind of you know street theater kind of stuff.  And then the powers that be came to him and cut him a deal and said well if you think you can do it, we'll make you the executive director.  So he comes in and he's the executive director and he begins to turn Fort Lauderdale housing around, but he had a drug problem.  Not, not him, but the Fort Lauderdale Housing Authority had a drug problem because they had drug dealers who were selling drugs in public housing.  They couldn't get, couldn't get 'em out.  So our black city commissioner then who was the late Carlton Moore said, "there's a young lawyer who is outside a state attorney's office who is fearless.  If you want him to, what you should do you should go he just, just opened his law office.  You should go talk to him Bill [Lindsey] and see if you can get him to start evicting the drug dealers from public housing in Fort Lauderdale."  So Bill Lindsey walks into my office as a young lawyer and he's talking, he's talking what I wanna hear which is I'll put you on retainer.  You know you can pay your bills if you can come in and help me with this, this.  So what I did was I started doing evictions of drug dealers.  And we fought legal aid tooth and nail even to the point of going to, to jury trials to, to get these drug dealers out and once the word got around that they were gonna be evicted and we also evicted some grandmas and some, some girlfriends who allowed it to go on then they, then the problem stopped.  And then so I began to, I was outside counsel to the housing authority, but as Lindsey began to do more innovative things, he, he sort of made me also a strategic brain to, to some of the things that he, that he tried to do.
Speaker 1: But where did that idea come from to evict the drug dealers and [simultaneous]?
Speaker 2: Well he couldn't, he, he they tried to do it with the crim--you know through the criminal justice system but they, they, they couldn't--I mean the cases were very difficult to make.  You know they gotta find 'em in possession and, and, and nobody would testify and so on and so forth.  So it ended up being the charges would get dropped criminally or they it was misde--it was a misdemeanor possession of marijuana which for a first offense wouldn't even involve jail.  So they, so they never, they were never able to actually get 'em out until they used Florida, the Florida law to actually to get folks to get 'em thrown out of public housing.  And so once word got around, the, the folks start I think to, to enforce themselves like look son I mean you know I'm not gonna let you come in here and sell drugs 'cause, 'cause they'll put me out you know so if, if you out here.  So once it took about a good year and a half for that to get it to, to, to so we can control the issue and then you know legal aid stopped defending people because it was--because they understood that we would take the cases to trial and we wouldn't settle them.
Speaker 1: I understand.
Speaker 2: You know, you're not gonna stay.
Story_ID: 139008
Speaker 1: I would imagine there would be some dangerous moments in this kind of work.  Were there any?
Speaker 2: It, there, the most dangerous moment was when, when I had a, a cop throw me on the ground as part of the trial that I, that I tried.  You know there was a question about whether there was police brutality because the, the officer had arrested one of the, one of the girlfriends.  And the girlfriends had alleged that the way that she was handled it was so brutal that you shouldn't believe anything that this officer says because he's lying so I had the, the officer essentially put me on the floor to demonstrate to the jury of how he was arrested.  And it was pretty--it was--that was the worse thang.  I, I didn't get any threats from any drug dealers.  And my and my office was in the neighborhood.  So I mean I didn't consider it to be dangerous and I just, it was just like, just like and even when I was a prosecutor you know I, I, I functioned in the, in the community so I mean I had my, my barber was the same.  Sometime I'd go to my barber.  I see guys that I prosecuted.  I go to the Morrison's [ph.] cafeteria, I see guys that I prosecuted.  They come up to me and say, "you Charles Cherry?  I say, "yeah."  "You don't remember me?"  "No, I mean where did I meet you?"  "In court.  You don't remember my case?  No brother, I, I handle 200 cases a week."  "Well I was, I was a defendant."  "Well, how did I treat you?  Did I treat you with respect?"  "Yeah, I mean, you know you did.  You know and I."  And so I mean because I treated them with respect, they may not have liked what I did, but I didn't treat them any differently which is what I saw as a prosecutor.  I saw disparage justice being needed out if a, if a, if a, if you got a big time attorney who, who, who was and you're, you have a case that involves possession of marijuana, and I saw deals being cut for the attorneys, that wouldn't be cut for a guy who was defending themselves.  And I said that that's a problem with me.  I saw young brothers who had criminal records unnecessarily because they didn't understand that what the deal they cut with another prosecutor gave them a criminal conviction.  I told them I'm gonna give you the same thing I'm gonna give the best defense attorney where somebody spent $10,000 to try to, to try beat a possession of marijuana charge.  So if you don't have a first defense, a first offense even though you don't have an attorney, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna adjudicate you guilty.  I'm gonna give you a withheld which is a free ride the first time which is the same thing I give somebody that's, that has an attorney.  And then I'd explain to 'em let me have this young brother, "let me tell you something.  Do you understand what I just did?"  And they, "no, I don't understand."  You do not have a criminal record but if I see you again, it's gonna be a different thing.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so I you know, that, that began and actually the reason that I, I love that job, but the reason I eventually left that job is that, that became a problem with some of the judges that I had you know.  They didn't like that.  They didn't like the fact that you had a prosecutor, particularly a black prosecutor is gonna say, "This is unfair.  I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna cut a deal because this is an attorney that you do business with on a regular basis or, or, or this attorney is, contributed to your, your, your campaign fund."  And so the, the, the state attorney started getting complaints because I wouldn't cut deals on some, on some of these, some of these cases.  Because I would tell them that these guys who are coming in here you're--it's a nod and a wink and they're back out in the streets.  I'm, I, I live in these--in this neighborhood.  So if you wanna cut them a sweet deal, then the judge is gonna have to do that.  You can't say that Charles Cherry the prosecutor cut that deal.  You cut the deal.
Story_ID: 139009
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were a prosecutor for twenty-one years?
Speaker 2: No, no just, just for two.
Speaker 1: Just for two years.
Speaker 2: Un huh.
Speaker 1: Oh, two years. Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: And then I began--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --to prosecute it you want to call it that drug dealers in public housing for the rest of my career with the housing authority [Fort Lauderdale Housing Authority]  until we went into the media.
Speaker 1: Okay so how long was that with?
Speaker 2: It's about ten years.
Speaker 1: About ten years?
Speaker 2: And [William] Bill Lindsey was just--he's a, he was a great man.  He died in 2001 unfortunately.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: But he left a real legacy and particularly in safe public housing and, and here's an interesting story is that he and I actually talked about getting the Nation of Islams and the Fruit of Islam to be a, a private security for us in public housing here.  And but the only reason that we didn't do it was that politically it just was untenable.  But we really--
Speaker 1: (unclear)
Speaker 2: --here in Fort Lauderdale [Florida].
Speaker 1: Yeah, this, this was tried I think in Chicago [Illinois] and [Washington] D.C.--
Speaker 2: Chicago and Baltimore [Maryland].
Speaker 1: I think yeah right, right.
Speaker 2: Baltimore.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: And they did a great job but it was the politics that did 'em in.  It wasn't the fact that crime did not go down and, and, and it was the fact that the politicians got involved and then they started going into the whole [HM Minister Louis] Farrakhan anti, anti-Jewish you know kind of mean and, and it was--it become political--it became politically untenable.  It was the same situation here.  We, we really were, were gonna do it but the local politics when we started floating it around as a trial balloon, it's like, it's just not gonna work.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Nation of, of the Fruit of Islam's reputation for discipline is well-known in the black community.
Speaker 2: Un huh.
Speaker 1: And they have respect for the people in the community.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: So.
Speaker 2: That's right.  So but for, for Bill [William Lindsey] to think about that and to ask for us to actually take action on that sort of let me know the kind of guy that I had as a client and as a, as a friend and because he was just really interested in the results.  He, he wanted things that were gonna work.  He believed in decent, safe and sanitary housing for, for low income people which is sort of the mantra of, of the department of, of Housing and Urban Development [HUD] and other problem, yeah, of, of HUD which is, which is what, which is what's in control from a governmental perspective of public housing.  He even put together a, a, a step up program which is a jobs apprenticeship for construction that's still going on now.  And they sent me up you know African gear and all 'cause I was "African-ized" even back then to go and lobby Tallahassee [Florida] for, for some favorable treatment in Florida law that we actually got to, to, to get that thing rolling.  So 'cause he believed that if he could get jobs for kids that were coming out of public housing, that he could change their lives and then public housing would no longer be necessary for them.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now, let's just, just picking up on that statement you were "African-ized" even then.
Speaker 2: Un huh.
Speaker 1: What do you mean by that and where do you--and when did it start?
Speaker 2: I went to Africa for the first time in 1983 with the National Bar Association.  And it was the first time, my first time there was on a trip with them to Senegal and Cote d'Ivoire and I, I remember, I remember how nervous I was when I first set foot on African soil but it felt like I was coming back home.  My mother [Julia Troutman Cherry] was there with me.  My sister was there and they, they sort of felt the same thing.  My mom said you know I see a whole lot of folks here that I, that I saw growing up with even the, the trees, the smell, the, the, the look of the place reminds me of growing up in Leslie, Georgia.  And in Senegal, what I'm, what I'm wearing is sort of African business wear.  So, I, I loved how the brothers walked around in, in, in, in grand boubous and, and what not over there.  So I brought some back and then I started wearing it and the first time that I went to court in it, one of the judges asked me was it a, you know was I Muslim, was this religious significance or was it a choir robe or what have you?  And I just told the judge, "No it's just African business, business attire."  And the good thing is that here in south Florida in the courtrooms I mean we're relatively relaxed, so you can come in without a tie.  You could come in you know with, with sport coats, not necessarily a suit.  So it, it's, it--this was probably the best place that I could think of to actually began to sort of change you know how I dress even, even as I go to, to court.  So I've, I've worn this consistently pretty much since 1983.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You know when we interviewed [HM] Isaac Hayes; he was dressed in a blue, sky blue boubou.
Speaker 2: Un huh.  So, so I guess I can say I'm--it's sort of my personal brand now.  The only times that I can remember a couple of times I've worn suits, one of 'em was when we were going on, on dog and pony shows to get money from Wall Street.  My brother [HM Dr. Glenn W. Cherry] told me I had to wear a suit.  You know he said, "Look, you--we are going to try to ask people for millions of dollars in venture capital.  You cannot go to Wall Street and not wear a suit."  "Okay.  All right.  I'll do that."  And then now once, one occasion other a good friend of mine asked me please wear a suit for I think her fortieth or fiftieth birthday party and then one time for my mom.  So that's about three times in the, and since in the last twenty years that I've actually worn a, a, you know a traditional suit.
Story_ID: 139011
Speaker 1: Now let me go well, I'm gonna go to 1989 with the purchase of WPUL [-AM].  Your, your, your father [Charles Cherry, Sr.] and your brother [HM Dr. Glenn W. Cherry] were involved in this right?
Speaker 2: Yes, my father, my brother and a group, a group of my fraternity brothers from Omega Psi Phi fraternity at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, University] we had established a venture capital fund so we got funds from Morehouse's venture capital fund and we got, got some, some friends and some family put some money together and bought that station in Daytona [Beach, Florida] that dad ran in conjunction with the Daytona Times for a number of years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now was this a station that was black-oriented at the time you purchased it?
Speaker 2: Country western.  So it was a country western station.  We made the biggest mistake that we, that we made as radio owners which is a rookie mistake which is to change the format from country western to black, basically R&B and all of our, our white clients just, they, they just left.  You know we thought that it doesn't matter what the format is and, and it did matter.  Because we lost every dollar from the little country western bars and the, the, the, the saddle stores and the, the, the shoe shops and all the rest of that, that had put money into this so.  If we had to do it over again, we would have left it alone.  But I think at that point in time we, we were just so happy in Daytona Beach [Florida] to have our own station that could play Earth, Wind and Fire and Teddy Pendergrass and all that 24/7 that we just--it was a big, it was sort of a big juke box for us when we, when we first started.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But did the advertising come?
Speaker 2: No.  Well advertising came but it didn't come from there.  So we when you are in a black format and once--that's one thing we've learned along the way that you pay a, you, you pay a disproportionate penalty for targeting black people in almost any business because you sort of, you sort of pigeon hole that white owned businesses or traditional or mainstream businesses.  You have to sort of prove to them that you'll bring value that, that black people do consume and, and, and it's, it's, it's an uphill struggle for the most part, particularly post--post-desegregation.  Again black folks can take their money anywhere.  And so you have to prove your value to both your black consumers as well as everybody else.  And that's sort of a double standard that I think that a whole lot of, of black businesses deal with.  But unfortunately that, that's just of sort of where we are right now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So, where does your advertising revenue come from now?
Speaker 2: Well it comes from, from folks who, who--well let me, let me back up.  What we decided to do particularly when we started having multiple stations is that we have multiple formats.  So you have, you have a chance to go to multiple customer, customer bases.  So we have a--you have a R&B format, you're looking at people who are targeting a black/urban audience.  You know you have a, a Hispanic format.  You have a jazz format.  You have a religious format.  You have a top forty format.  So when we, when we got, where we had eleven stations, we sort of run the--ran the gamut in terms of the number of formats and so you have a better chance of, of, of having a, a much broader consumer base that you can, that you can serve and then you have different formats that you can sell to, to an advertiser.
Speaker 1: So, so you started, well you started with WPUL was that sort of like a testing ground for what you would do with the rest of your stations?  'Cause the other stations were purchased from what I understand from 2000 to--from 1998 to 2000,--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --I guess?
Speaker 2: Yep, yep.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Un huh.  Well we--I think we learned how to be broadcasters at WPUL.  You know we, we learned, we learned how to, how to tell time 'cause radio time is very exact.  You learn what people respond to and what they don't.  You learn how to, how to, how to carve expense.  I mean the whole issue of revenue and expenses in radio is, is different from, from other kinds of industries.  You know you learn, you learn, so you learn it and it wasn't something that I think we did consciously originally to go and get bigger, but when we--what we saw, when we saw how daddy was having fun and he was making money, we looked at it from a, from a financial perspective that radio has value and that there are stations out there that we can get and we learned enough about radio to turn it around and a sort of get stations that may be undervalued or that maybe, that may have too many, too much expenses and then from a business perspective put 'em in a--shape, pick a format and then move, move it forward.
Story_ID: 139012
Speaker 1: Now, now did you form Tama Broadcasting when you purchased WPUL [-AM] or was it some--something you and your brother [HM Dr. Glenn W. Cherry] did?
Speaker 2: Tama was formed after we, we began to grow.  So the original station with WPUL was Psi Communications which was named after our chapter of Omega Psi Phi fraternity at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  So that was the Morehouse connection that, that helped us to, to get that, that station originally.  Tama Broadcast was formed after, after we linked up with Black Enterprises venture capital fund and then we began to buy stations in Jacksonville, Florida and then we bought another group of stations in Savannah, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  All right.  So this is, so all--now okay so you were general manager of [W]PUL in the beginning, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, general manager.  I mean, I, I--we were doing cheap dish, bottle washer, had a show, recorded shows.  I mean we did everything.  When you are a small owners of a station, you do everything.  I mean you, you do a little light weight engineering or you learn how to, to do a little, fix up every pair of various pieces of equipment.  So you do everything.
Speaker 1: So what were your days like?
Speaker 2: Days were, were you're up early six or seven in the morning.  You're at the station.  You're making sure you know we have, we had live, well we were pretty much live for the most part so you making you know--the, the first thing you always got the station on the air.  You know you used, you used to carry before cell phones, you used to carry transistor radio all the time to make sure that the station was always on the air.  And, and if somebody was absent, you go in there and, and play some music or whatever you did.  And you were just always around.  If, if, if I needed to record a, a somebody that for like a church or something, then I could do that.  So one thing that we learned is that you never let somebody make themselves indispensable in a radio station.  The only indispensable person is your engineer because some things you just gotta have a professional to do, but a voice talent, a DJ [disc jockey], somebody like that, you know somebody that can, can load, that can work, run a computer or whatever, you, you, you, we always learn everything that, that we had to know in terms of operating a station so that nobody could, could, could hold us hostage.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So in terms of the urban format, you'd start off with a morning man I guess?
Speaker 2: Morning--yeah we had in, in--we had a morning DJ who was--her name was Mattie Howard.  Ms. Howard was actually a gospel promoter and we started out from the beginning with her from, she started out from six to seven in the morning playing gospel and praying and that kind of thing and then we, we expanded that from six to nine.  And she was there like clockwork for years.  Even to the point where she had strokes on the air and I had to actually go in and take her off because the, the folks were saying there some problem with Mattie.  Her voice is slurred you know so but she kept, she loved what she was doing and so, but you, you--we, so we built that station on that kind of dedication.  It was really a community oriented station and with somebody like Ms. Howard there, she was, she was always there.
Speaker 1: Had she had a previous radio experience?
Speaker 2: She had yeah, she had, she had previous radio experience, actually at the same station.  So she, she would come in at just--but, but she was only doing an hour.  And she would use it--we didn't have to pay her.  She would basically you, you know we traded out some time for her gospel promotions and whatever else she was doing and she had a, she had a right to, to sell some time to other folks so on and so forth so.  But it, you know, radio has changed substantially from that kind of live and local flavor to now you have syndicated shows like Tom Joyner on and you know that's taking a lot of jobs from folks who and, and which is why radio for my perspec--it's tough for me right now to listen to radio any more.
Speaker 1: Un huh.
Speaker 2: For a number of different reasons you know.  You go from one town to other; it's always the same thing.  You know it's no different local personalities.  You can't figure out what's going on in a community anymore for the most part by turning on the radio station.  In particular for black and, and they are, are a handful of black-owned stations anymore.  And, and they, I mean it's, it's, it's a tough industry to be in right now.  But and it's, it's difficult for me to listen.
Story_ID: 139013
Speaker 1: Now when you bought, when your family purchased WPUL I mean with the help of the Omega Psi Phi and the other investors, what was there--was the tax, the tax incentive program or the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] still in effect?
Speaker 2: No, no, it wasn't.  It came in effect afterwards.  And before we bought, started buying stations in numbers, it had already been eliminated.  So, so we missed pretty much the window of the tax certificates, which was unfortunate but I, I tell you, I'm glad you mentioned that because one of the things that, that has destroyed black radio is, has been government policy.  Particularly the Telecommunications Act of 1996, when essentially all or most of the limits were taken off radio and then now you have a clear channel that can, that can own and operate 1,500 stations out of the 10,000 you know a, a around the country.  And that impacted our ability to stay in radio because we were competing against these large behemoths who, who would essentially cut their, their, their prices so low that that you couldn't' compete.  And then when, and then when the government would not, would not enforce anti-trust regulations, the FCC wasn't enforcing its rules.  So it, it made it very difficult for a small not even black owned but small locally owned stations to survive because you're, you're on top of.  You're trying, you're trying to work underneath these large stations that have three, four or five groups of stations to sell different formats and you only got one.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.
Speaker 2: They'll put you out of business.  And that's that's what, that is, that is really what has happened and now that Wall Street is involved in radio, I mean they could care less about anything local.  And so now the, the and from a historical perspective, people don't understand the importance of black radio to the civil rights movement, they really don't.  They don't understand it when you had independent voices because you had black people who owned stations locally.  They weren't concerned about things necessarily that happened in New York or you know our, out station in Daytona [Beach, Florida], we, we're concerned about what's happening here and you could listen to us and you could know what's happening here.  What you need to do.  The things that you need to know about.  It's so homogenized now so nationalized that, that you know it's just, it, it doesn't serve the, the, the real public interest purpose that radio was always supposed to serve.
Speaker 1: Do, do you see any signs of, of the independence coming back or?
Speaker 2: No.  No.  It's, it's--if, if, if no.  I don't see it coming back.  Radio is capital intensive you know and it's a regulated industry which means you gotta, you gotta have lawyers involved, you gotta have engineers involved.  And, and because of the, of the financial difficulty in, in, in, in--first you got to put money in the operation and then you have to go out and sell advertising and it's competing against digital and newspapers are going down and, and television.  So, so it's, it's a tremendous amount of competition for the advertising base.  And radio is not, is not competing well.  And it's, and it's probably more difficult to compete locally.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So do your stations now carry any of the canned digital programs?
Speaker 2: We carry; we carry some, some canned stuff because you have to.  The, the, the one of the other issues is that because of the, the, the down turn in revenue, you can't pay people to come in on a local basis like you want to.  You have to pay for the content.  And a, a lot of the, of the canned content is free and free in quotation marks.  What you do is that they run, they run commercials so that you don't, you don't pay them, you pay them essentially you barter the time the commercial time.  So they give the content in exchange for being able to run advertisements in certain holds in the program.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you're allowed to run your own ads and certain other holds, that's what?
Speaker 2: Correct, correct.  So, so but it's a, it's a tough business model right now.  Particularly for somebody that's, that's a standalone station where all you have to sell is, is this one, one station in a small market where the competition has you know one or two or three different--because you're competing against larger company you know Clear Channel, Cox Broadcasting, Cumulus [Media], Salem [Radio Network] you know these kinds of, of multinational, not multinational but large publicly traded companies.
Story_ID: 139014
Speaker 1: Now when you, you served as general manager of the Greenville, South Carolina station WCSZ, did you have to move there to do that?
Speaker 2: Moved there for three years, had a great time in Greenville [South Carolina].  You know so I shut my law office down here in, in Fort Lauderdale [Florida].  We just you know we moved up there and, and tried to turn that, that station, radio station around.  It had signal problems.  It was a 50,000 watt station which means that it could, it could broadcast over two states.  But it had some technical issues.  It had been off the air when we bought it.  And eventually we did turn it around but we turned it around essentially by going to a Hispanic format.  So it's, it's a Spanglish station.  So you know sort of a combination between English and Spanish right now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  And you own that one and then you own you said five now, right?
Speaker 2: Well we, we owned, we owned eleven affiliated stations.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But right now we, we own just, just the two.  So we own WPUL in Daytona [Beach, Florida] and we own WCSZ in Greenville.  So the other stations that are, are back with so we essentially sort of parted ways with our investors.  So we, we downsized, took out, we, we, we got our two stations back and then we--when dad [Charles Cherry, Sr.] died in '04 [2004], we, we transitioned to, to back to the newspaper fulltime.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So Tama Broadcasting owns eleven stations, is that what you said?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah (simultaneous).  We owned--when we operated it.  (simultaneous) It's no longer under our, our operation.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: So we own eleven stations.  Right now it's under other operation and ownership and, and they've sold off some of the stations so I think they may own four or five right now.
Speaker 1: Hmmm.  Was it difficult to get rid of I mean to--
Speaker 2: It's, it's a tough market to sell radio stations and to make money.  And it, the, the market has been sliding for some time.  And so Tama sold stations but I don't, they don't--didn't make you know they didn't make the money that I think they thought they were gonna make when they sold those stations.  So I mean, media right now is very, very difficult because of the, the impact of the internet and the amount of money that people can pay essentially for internet advertising is pennies as compared to what, what you would sell for advertising for newspapers, radio, TV.  So, so the, the, the, the eyeball you know the, the, the price per eyeball in, in, in digital is so low as compared to everything else that it's just thrown the whole media revenue model out of whack in the last ten years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you have--you and your brother [HM Dr. Glenn W. Cherry] have two stations--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --now?
Speaker 2: Yeah, family and [simultaneous]
Speaker 1: Two newspapers?
Speaker 2: Yes, two newspapers.
Speaker 1: Two newspapers okay.
Story_ID: 139015
Speaker 1: All right.  Now I haven't talked much about the newspaper, well in terms before we leave radio, you've had your own programs?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: On your stations and, and what programs, what, what are they like, what do you do?
Speaker 2: Free, 'Free Your Mind' of--I've had that, that program for twelve years just, just actually put it on hiatus this year.  I started out as an, as, as an hour in 2000 as, as sort of a call in local talk show once a week.  And then I quit taking phone calls 'cause people were afraid to talk to me 'cause I was, I was a little too aggressive so for, for a couple of years after that, then I--it was an hour and I would do research and you know we talked about sex and the Bible.  We talked about homosexuality and whether it was, it was something that was, was developed or genetic.  We've talked about the [President George W.] Bush administration.  We talked about [HM President Barack] Obama whether he was good for black people.  And then so, and then so it sort of morphed into the last five or six years it was just a half hour monologue featuring me.
Speaker 1: Now, now do you talk about anything that was really controversial?
Speaker 2: Everything controversial.
Speaker 1: I'm just kidding you.
Speaker 2: (aughing) Everything.
Speaker 1: I' just kidding you at this point.  That's, that's quite a lineup of subjects--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --to talk about.  I could imagine there'd be a lot of heat generated there.
Speaker 2: We generated a lot of heat and I had a great time and I told, I, I had to thank my listeners because for me it was a, it was a half hour of venting frustrations once a week at Tuesday to noon and then we rerun it on Sunday.  And I tell you one of the most interesting things was that I, when I would talk particularly about the black people in, in, in my little town and some of the problems that I saw, especially when we had an issue where some young, young brothers were selling drugs off of one of our--off the, the steps of one of our oldest churches.  And I challenged the, the local preachers to say how--"What kind of God do you serve if you allow drugs to be sold off a church that has been in this community and in continuous operation for more than 100 years and you do nothing about it?" And I told him, I told him, "Because y'all are punks.  You not gonna do anything about it."  And so and, and I, and I told him I said, "If I'll meet you out there."  I said, "If I, if I were y'all I'd be having revival.  I wouldn't be calling the cops on them.  I'd say we gonna have revival right here and we're gonna sit down and talk to these brothers and say there's something that we got for you and we're, and we're--but we're gonna stay here and if you wanna stay here, you're gonna have to listen to what we got to say and then have twenty-four hour revival."  I said, "I'll give y'all a radio station and we'll, we'll run advertising to get the folks out there.  But y'all ain't gonna do it because you're sorry."  And, and so I went, I went sort of deep on 'em and I got word back that some of them were talking about boycotting the station.  And I got back on the air the next week and told them, "So y'all are, y'all are gonna boycott me for telling the truth, but you not gonna boycott young brothers that's sitting there still right now selling drugs on your, on, on your front stoop?  What kind of sense did that make?  That, that tells me that y'all are just what I told you.  What y'all are punks.  And you not, you not gonna boycott either one of us.  You not gonna boycott them and you not gonna boycott me."
Speaker 1: Now, now some people would even think that that might indicate some kind of collusion between the drug dealers and the pastors.
Speaker 2: I, well, I, I didn't you know.  That could be possible you know (simultaneous).  I mean, I mean it's possible you know.
Speaker 1: I mean, I mean you were involved with the housing authority where people were being evicted from public housing for selling drugs.  What, what would happen if a community moved on the pastor to close his church down because of drug sales?
Speaker 2: The pastor, let me tell you something, and I'm in a church.  But I still gotta tell the truth.  Some of these pastors and not all of them, but some of the use the Bible as a, as a whip against the people because they, the people are so afraid of holding pastors accountable because they believe God will punish them if they do.  So and I think these, these pastors understand that.  They can come up with, with, with all kinds of scriptures to justify the lack--and that was a problem with my father [Charles Cherry, Sr.].  My father often talked about the fact that he had a mission in Daytona [Beach, Florida] to speak for people who could not speak to--for themselves, but he also, he always he, he, he didn't respect a lot of the local preachers because he always said, "Y'all should be doing what I'm doing.  You know I'm just one man with a business that's standing up for this black community and y'all, you  all, you all are an organization that, that, that, that, are but you're not doing what I'm doing."  But still he was a member of a black church and he, he, he was a, a tither for the whole, whole fifty years he was, he was in this church, but he was, he was just sorely disappointed and he let it be known that he was very disappointed in the, in the, in the performance of the church in our little town, the churches in our little town.
Story_ID: 139016
Speaker 1: So, do you mind telling us what the name of the church was or, or-- (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Let's see, this was I think this was Mount Bethel Institution of Baptist Church in Daytona Beach [Florida].  I'm pretty sure, Mount Bethel Institution of Baptist Church [sic, Mount Bethel Baptist Institutional Church].
Speaker 1: Whatever happened?  Did they ever resolve it?
Speaker 2: Nothing.
Speaker 1: Nothing.
Speaker 2: Nothing, I think the, the drug dealers just decided you know what I, I, you know I think they may still be there just not in the numbers and just not as frequently.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All gone to a better site.
Speaker 2: Gone to a better--where they just you know they move around.
Speaker 1: So there's no?
Speaker 2: But there was, there was never any ecclesiastical you know resolution to that issue.  And, and I continued it--and I mean that's, I've, I've been very hard on our local churches in Daytona Beach.  Because as I said there are seven of 'em in the, in the less than half mile between as I make a right--a left turn going to our radio station, there are seven of 'em in half a mile.
Speaker 1: These are you know a lot of the problems that exist in Daytona Beach are like coming to you know two to four again all around the country the police brutality.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Dope dealers.  But what, what are the--what's the major issue in the Daytona Beach community today?
Speaker 2: The major issue is the joblessness.  The--we have not as much anymore perhaps but you know babies making babies.  We still have the you know the single family head of household and it's and it's worse than it was before because for, for young sisters who find themselves in that situation they can't get a job.  There's, there's no--if they can get a job, it's a low wage job; it's a minimum wage job.  So we have minimum wage issues some--that, that folks will strike about you know on the fast food industry.  And Florida's minimum wage is I think is maybe $3.80 or something, I'm sorry, maybe $7.80 'cause we did have--we voted a minimum wage raise a few years back.  But it's, it's nowhere near, it's nowhere near a living wage.  We have week community institutions as I indicated you know our churches you know our, our schools.  We don't--we have our middle class just like every place else.  Black middle classes moved to the suburbs.  We're in gated communities now.  We come back to go to church perhaps.  We got our kids in private schools.  We're, we're trying to look out for our own and keep our heads down and keep our jobs and keep our pensions.  And we're just saying if there for the grace of God go I.  And I, I, I just, I'm, I'm, I'm an optimistic person generally speaking but I'm a realist.  And I just don't see a move toward doing anything different.  And I don't, and, and that's, that's very frustrating to me.  I mean, I think personally that the solution to many of black America's problems are in Africa from both a resource perspective from the standpoint of entrepreneurship in Africa as well as a cultural perspective.  Black culture in this country is, is gone to hell.  You know we, we, we got flat screen TVs.  We, we, we can go and, and sit down any place we want if we got the money to, to buy, to buy things.  And you know we, we've become as lazy as anybody else in, in American culture.  And we've been put to sleep you know by the Internet and, and I mean I, I, I'm, I'm pessimistic right now about where America, in particular where black America is going.
Story_ID: 139017
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let me ask you about the newspapers.  The Daytona Times, now did your father [Charles Cherry, Sr.] work on the paper up until his death or did--?
Speaker 2: Yes, he worked; he worked on the paper up until he died.  The--generally speaking, he had a, he was more of a publisher than, than a writer.  He, he only--he wrote very, very seldom.  But he set sort of the editorial tone for the paper.  He, he sold our ads on the paper.  And he pretty much controlled everything.  And up, up until he got, he, he was just too, he, he died of colon cancer so up until the time that you know he start taking chemo therapy and, and that stuff start to wear on his energy.  Yeah, he, he did everything.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, well what kind of staff did he have at the time?
Speaker 2: A couple of writers and one, one graphic designer, a couple of photographers and he, he, he just say go here, go there and that's how he got it done every week.  You know he'd, he'd be shocked that we're able to do what we do now because right, right now we're a virtual operation.  Everything is done in cyberspace.  If I'm over in Africa, and, and which is in fact where I was when the Trayvon Martin case broke, I had a--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --call from Ben Crump [Benjamin L. Crump] and I was over in Africa, that he could not get traction on Trayvon's case when he had been going to mainstream media to try to get people to understand what happened.  And I told him, "Well Ben, let me get on that right now."  I was, I was in Accra, Ghana.  Got my MacBook Pro, sent an email to a couple of my folks and say you know here's, here's a story here.  We need to, we need to put that front and center.  And so we were part of sort of the first, first media group that sort of broke Trayvon.  Now he made other calls to other black folks but we were part of the sort of first group that saw Trayvon's death as a, as a major story and because of what we do and how we do it now, I could do that even you know being out of the country. Dad couldn't under--he, he--it was very difficult for him to transition from sort of the, the, the pony express way of doing things with, with the, the, the light boards and the wooden wheels and the spray adhesive to doing PDFs [portable document format] and having stringers and not standing over some a graphic designer shoulders because we've just got a--we got a, a, a pretty much a, a, a, a group of, of folks who are stringers and independent contractors and everything is done by FTP [file transfer protocol] and Word files and PDF files.  I--and I only see a hard copy of the paper when everybody else sees it on Thursday in the Daytona Times and on Friday on rest around the state on the Florida Courier.
Speaker 1: So you don't see it before it's out?
Speaker 2: Not, because--
Speaker 1: Who?
Speaker 2: --it's virtual.  You know so I see it in PDF--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and we correct the PDFs and then finalize them and then the PDF is sent to the printer and I, I get there's a paper out there that I get just when the folks here at church get it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it's most--I mean how, how many copies or hard copies do you print out?
Speaker 2: Of the [Florida] Courier, 90,000 a week.  And I think about 7,000 in, in the City of Daytona [Beach, Florida].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So ninety thousand, so you actually cover black communities in most of the major Florida cities?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And Miami-Dade County [Florida], Briar County [Florida], which is Fort Lauderdale [Florida] and surrounding areas, West Palm Beach [Florida], which is West Palm Beach County [Florida], St. Lucia County [Florida] which is where we started.  That's, that's Fort Pierce [Florida], Orange County [Florida], which is Orlando [Florida], Duval County [Florida], which is Jacksonville [Florida], Hillsborough County [Florida], which is Tampa [Florida] and Pinellas County [Florida], which is St. Petersburg [Florida].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So all the high density black populations of those areas the Courier goes.
Speaker 1: All right, all right.  So is, this comes out once a week right?  Every week?
Speaker 2: Once a week, every Friday.
Speaker 1: Every Friday, okay, all right.

Speaker 1: Do you have any major features of the paper that people look forward to that are, are unique I guess to?
Speaker 2: We you know you go back to the future.  We, we got our 'Jet Beauty of the Week' male and female we call Florida's Finest and people look to--look for that.  And I think they also look for our editorial--we got a very strong editorial pages.  One, I have a, a, a, a weekly column called Straight, No Chaser and I do only about 325 words but, so I don't have time to waste.  And I'm getting straight to the point on things that are and, and one of, one of the things that I, I know that people look to us is to have a very wide range and independent editorial stance.  So we got you know folks from black conservatives from Project 21, we've got you know black leftists from, from, from Black Agenda Report, we've got stuff in between.  We've got local stuff you know based on stuff that I see in Florida from me.  We've got some, some folks that, that do nothing but sort of handle things here in the state of Florida and then where ever I see something that I think is a, a compelling guest editorial that just makes folk, makes folks think you know we'll put it in there.  I mean we've, we've had stuff even from, from, from black Confederate supporters (laughter) in, in the Florida Courier and I like being able to surprise the readers and not just have sort of the, the usual sort of democratic you know leaning kind of, kind of editorial stuff that they, they think that you know that sort of pigeonhole the black press.
Story_ID: 139019
Speaker 1: So I, I have a--we have a great time I think putting together our editorial pages because it's--because we just like to mix it up like that and get people upset you know.  And I, I, I especially keep 'em upset 'cause I'm--I think I'm probably one of the few journalists black journalists that's trying to or not black journalists but, but one of the few black folks have--that have any kind of media outlet whatsoever that's trying to hold the President [HM President Barack Obama] accountable for black people.  We have been lulled to sleep in the last six years.  And I get a whole lot of grief from my readers about the fact that I put that and, and say that, that [HM] Barack Obama will not be considered a transformational leader.  He will be considered perhaps at best a trans--a, a, trans, a transitional leader that gets us past the, the second Bush [George W. Bush] administration.  Now we were, we were, we had major problems.  But from when I look at what he has done with regard particularly to the issues of black America, he's been absent without leave.
Speaker 2: Now did you have high hopes when President Obama was elected?
Speaker 1: No.  But I had--I, I what I didn't expect is that he was gonna be you know do worse than other presidents.  I expected him that what I, what I hoped I had, I had high hopes but modest expectations.  I--my hopes were at the very least he would make the, the argument for black America being treated differently from the perspective of the disproportionate pain that black people find themselves in.  And that if you have, if you in dispropor--and I, and I as I tell my, my readers, I say look you know you go to the hospital, there's a issue, there's a protocol of what do you call it when you have to, to basically say somebody's got a broken arm, somebody's got a broken leg, somebody's had a heart attack you know.  So, so, so you have to sort of cate--and there's a you know the term for that.  Triage.  There's a, there's a, there's--you have to have you know a triage where, where those people who deserve, who are in the, the desperate straits are treated first and treated disproportionately even with regard to resources than anybody else.  And when you look at the, the unemployment situation, when you look at the disproportionate mobility and mortality; when you look at the disposition of joblessness, the disproportionate and, and, and incarceration.  All of those things means that there, there are issues in black America that have been deferred for, for decades and part of it as a consequence of government policy.  So if you are the head of this government, it's your responsibility to begin to change governmental policy.  And if you can't change it at the very least you should be making the argument that it should be changed.  That's what I expected.  I, I would have, I would have expected during the time that he had control of the government of, of both the, the house and senate, that those issues would have been addressed, but they weren't.  They weren't even on the agenda.  And then the black, the black, the Congressional Black Caucus you know and the, the, the "Civil Rights Leadership," in quotation marks, let it slide.  They said well he'll get to our issues.  Well he's not gonna get to our issues.  He can't get to our issues now.  But we still should make him accountable for that.

Speaker 1: Now, this summer has brought to light a lot of, of a number of specific justice issues in the black community, in Ferguson, Missouri, in Dayton, Ohio other places--
Speaker 2: Un huh.
Speaker 1: --where black men were shot or downed by--
Speaker 2: Un huh.
Speaker 1: --police officers, what do you think of, of the [HM] Eric Holder's term as, as attorney general?
Speaker 2: Holder's term has been okay.  I think that he's done a, he's done a good job of, of, of, of addressing some of those issues but they're all being addressed sort of in isolation.  There's no systemic changes that you can point to.  You on--you have, you, you have a situation where there was a law that was passed that, that they tried to do, to, to not eliminate but to moderate the disproportionate punishment of, of powered cocaine versus crack cocaine.  That's, that's, that's a drop in the bucket.  Because you still don't deal with the disproportionate incarceration level of black men and our black women in America.  You know so, so, so what I see are, are, are sort of band aids, you know appro--an approach rather than a systemic approach that's taken some of the ills that that black America have.  I mean and, and then when, when he talks, he talks about personal responsibility.  Well I'll, I'll take, I'll take that, that, that hit in terms of personal responsibility, but, but isn't that in that isn't that also a governmental responsibility with regard to policies and procedures that can be used because part of this comes as a consequence of government, of, of governmental policies.  But, but, but the government is, is abdicating itself and, and, and from these responsibilities and some of 'em are, are as a consequence of laws that were, that were passed fifty years ago.  Redlining it was a governmental policy of Department of Housing and Urban Development.  You know the loans.  I mean that--those were official policies of FHA [Federal Housing Administration].  You know so, so I'll, I'll take my responsibility as a, as a man, as a parent and all and as, as a community member, but you take some responsibility for, for, for doing the things that, that it takes because certain, certain things only a government can change.
Story_ID: 139021
Speaker 1: All right.  As a publisher and a broadcaster here in Florida, what are some of your thoughts about the Trayvon Martin case?
Speaker 2: As a prosecutor you know, I understand--I, I knew this was gonna happen.  And I told again, we told the readers to expect an acquittal because of the way that the, the Stand Your Ground Law [2005]was written and because of the, the the whole issue of the, the prosecutors have the burden of proof in this case.  And I, I just, I just, I saw it coming.  And we told our readers that, that it was gonna come and we told them that based on Florida law, it was gonna happen again and that it's, that other than again, a governmental change is gonna get worse before it gets better.  Now Florida has what they call a Warning Shot Bill [2014] which means that you can shoot at somebody as a warning shot to back them off of you if you have a licensed weapon and then it's no, it's no longer considered an aggravated assault.  So it's not a felony any more.  So I can take a gun and then I can aim to your left as long as I don't hit you, if I feel that you are a threat to me and that threat doesn't have to be armed, that threat is a subjective threat which means, that means if I believe you are a threat, I have a right one to shoot a warning shot at you or and if I decide that, that you are a threat enough to shoot you at by using deadly force, the Stand Your Ground Law will acquit me.
Speaker 1: Hmmm.
Speaker 2: That's the law in the State of Florida.
Speaker 1: So it's going to happen again?
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No doubt about it.  And you know it's a governmental policy by that, that, that has nothing to do with personal responsibility of me or anybody else.  It's a govern--it's a law passed by the, the Florida Legislature.  So the only change that you have is that you--it has to be a change in the law.
Story_ID: 139022
Speaker 1: What, what kind of African American leadership do you have in Florida legislation now or in the State of Florida?
Speaker 2: The, the, the legislative leadership, the black legislative leadership is weak and it's all Democrat.  We are, we are a Republican dominated state.  You don't have any black Republicans in the, in the Florida legislature.  And the, the Re--the Democrats are not strong Democrats.  They don't make the case.  And when they do make the case, they, they don't do it in a way in which I think is, is strategic.  I'm, I'm, I'm, I've been very--I'm disappointed in it, but I also understand this that because gerrymandering in Florida, is difficult to do anything any different.  Because if we're, we're just like a lot of other states, we've been gerrymandered to the point where the Democrats have--the Republicans essentially have said, "We will allow you to have more black, more black elected officials in exchange for us having more Demo--more, more Republicans."  So, so, so, so when, when you, you, you, you cut your state up where yeah you, you can--you'll have a all black districts, but the dis--but the folks who represent those districts will all be Democrats.  You can't reelect--elect a--you probably can't elect a black Republican.  So, so that satisfies and the, the, the--I, I think the Republicans are much more strategic in counting, in, in counting heads and counting votes and, and count--and, and understanding the whole issue of, of, of leverage and control.  So they'll, they'll give you know you'll have twenty-five or thirty all Democrat or Democratic black officials in exchange for a majority republican house and senate.  That's what you have.  That's what you're gonna have for the next ten years.
Speaker 1: So the proportions are gonna stay the same?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Regardless of you know.
Speaker 2: So the solution to my problem from my perspective is that, that black people need to start walking away from the Democratic party and moving toward the middle.  We've been talking about having no party affiliation in Florida and people actually I think are starting to do that here even though we have closed primaries.  So what does that mean?  That means that you can register to, to vote in a Republican primary thirty days before the primary starts.  So and, and, and you can and, and--but for instance in my, in my, my personal voting affiliation is N.P.A. [no party affiliation], which is--which means I don't have a party.  If I, this year, I wanted to, to vote in the Democrat primary, so thirty days before the primary, I change my registration to Democrat.  And then after I voted, I'll change it back to Republican, but you have to be, you have to understand how important your vote is and you have to be willing to, to do the extra, walk the extra mile to do that.  But what, what the numbers say is that black people are walking away from the Democratic party.  But the question is will the Republican party see that as a way for them to say okay we see that you walked away.  We want to try to, to convince you to join us.  I think that's the only way that we can, we can get through and, and begin to have some leverage is to start walking away from either party and then have them to essentially to become swing voters.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Story_ID: 139023
Speaker 1: Now, what do you see as the future of, of your media enterprises?
Speaker 2: The future is, is there.  It's, it's, it's difficult let's put it that way. It's challenging.  Because of the digital penetration which is why we have, we have began, begun to put a lot more time and effort in, into our social media and into our, our web presence.  The--I think eventually probably hard copies of newspapers maybe almost print on demand.  Which means that you know you, you're not gonna do what--you can't get what you, what you getting now which is we're doing mass, we're doing mass drops because our papers are free model, so we're dropping it in small black businesses and churches and schools and so on and so forth.  Probably what you're going to have to have at some point in time as the message began to change is that if you want a printed copy you're gonna have to pay for it.  And then it's almost, almost a subscrip--on a subscription basis and then because--and then also because of the fact that black people over index or we use a disproportionate amount of bandwidth in our phones for, for on our smart phones for internet access for Twitter and Facebook and everything else that we're gonna have to target our folks on, on cell phones in order to get them the message because I--it's no doubt in my mind that there's, that, that from a perspective of information it's more important than ever to have a black--the black press.  Our voices are more important than ever because of, of because of, of all the issues that our folks are facing that they're not, that, that they don't even understand some sometimes.  But the--from a newspaper print perspective, I think we have some, we got some uphill climb--challenges that we have to, we have to face and as an industry just as, as daily newspapers have a challenge that they have to face.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And for you personally, are--what are your future plans?  Do you, you plan to ride out media? (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: I'm, I'm gonna be here long as we, as long as we have it.  And as long as I'm in health and as long as God gives me the--to, to move this forward.  I love the fact that I have a voice and that our voice is distinctive and that is necessary and that we bring a different perspective to, to in a proudly and unapologetically black perspective to what we do.  I'm, I'm gonna do some more writing and I got some--I'm a, I've, I've reissued 'Excellence Without Excuse [The Black Student's Guide to Academic Excellence,'Charles W. Cherry II] as a, as a classic version because I know that that's more necessary for our black students than, than ever.  Time management, goal setting, academic skills and, and, and, and being able to do those things that are necessary in, in the school system.  I got another book out called, that's gonna be coming out called 'Grief and Words' which is essentially eulogies.  And speaking to you know to at, at death of some things that I've written and some, some great eulogies that I've read you know and, and heard over, over the space of time.  Because I, I just personally believe that everybody who is on this planet deserves a remembrance and I just think that's one of the important sort of points in, in anybody's life and transition through this, through this lifetime.
Story_ID: 139024
Speaker 1: So I've got some other things that I'm gonna do.  We, we're also looking at both non-profit and some, some for-profit activity in western Africa.  Unfortunately, we were getting ready to get involved in some for profit activity in Sierra Leone, but now that, now that Ebola is there, we sort of put that on hold.  But I, because I just believe, I, I love Africa from the culture perspective and I think that as, as difficult as it is for small businesses here in America for particularly small black businesses, the sky is the limit actually in Africa, which is ready to do business.  And I think black Americans bring, bring a lot to the table to, to Africa, particular with regard to the American brand of business which is still pretty good in most places.  And I think that American work ethic and sort of the, the the, the, the technological sophistication and I think the understanding of how small, of how technology can be a small business equalizer and I think the, the level of, of excellence that we, we think of when we do business here that we can bring that to a world class level of Africa if we can get with the brothers and sisters there and with the governments and sort of understand you know how we, how we can fit together and, and as important to me is that African culture can help us to do some things here and to deal with the whole psychology of being black in America that we, that we have--that's a piece of the miss--the puzzle that's missing for us here.
Speaker 2: Now are your contacts in Africa, like business contacts, mainly or do you have any governmental connections?
Speaker 1: We got, we got business contacts.  We got governmental contacts.  We've got non-governmental contacts.  So we, we've got a lot of folks in Africa that, that are, that we can sit down and then we got some contacts here in the diaspora.  There's some Africans here who see opportunities and I think who see a willingness in certain places in Africa to begin to do some things on a business and on a cultural level that, that have not, they have not seen previous to, to now.  And but once again, and once, once we can get past Ebola, you know I think that things will begin to pick up again.  'Cause they were picking up actually before this year and I think that it's unfortunate though that the President [HM Barack Obama] has been a day late and a dollar short and American has generally with regard to doing business in Africa as a Chinese are just you know all over the place.  And that, that's been a problem.
Speaker 2: Are your ideas for African business primarily involved in--I mean centered around media?
Speaker 1: No, un un.  From my perspective, that's a very risky ven--a venture because of the two things, one is that and, and when you have most of the time you have--you're--we're looking at stable governments, but if that, when the first time that there's government instability, the first target are media outlets.  And there are other, other less, less risky ventures that we can get involved with where and then from the infrastructure perspective you know you have the electricity problems and some of that kind of in--basic infrastructure that is difficult to, to have a consistent--we're, we're used to twenty-four hour media here.  And that's difficult and still in most places in Africa because you're gonna have brown outs that are accepted part of doing business over there or in you know the lack of technology and so on and so forth.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So now we're looking at, we're, we're looking at other kinds of things that just and it's just based on an evaluation of what's necessary and what you can do given the existent of business climate and the existing infrastructure in the, in the, in the nations that we're looking at.
Story_ID: 139025
Speaker 1: Sir, when you look back on your career at this point in your life, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could back and change something?
Speaker 2: Hmmm, a few things.  You know I--procrastination has, has hurt me and so there's a few things that I, I, I think that earlier I took time a little bit more for granted than I do now that as I've said to, to my listeners.  I have more, more life in the, in the rear view mirror than I do in the, in the front windshield.  But I think that, that, that sort of goes with, with an understanding and with age and a certain degree of wisdom.  So as a young person I know I always felt I had the time to get things done and it was gonna get done and I could you know and, and then secondly, I think I've always been a smorgasbord.  I love life.  And I love things and we've tried to do a whole lot of different things.  And to a certain extent you become a, a jack of all trades and a master of none.  I feel like I'm good at a few things, maybe I'm great to a certain extent at what I do in terms of the journalism.  And if I--and I, I think probably I try to get my kids to focus a little bit more on things because I, I think that when you find that focus early, then you can, you can begin to do things that you wanna do and I--there was something that, that, that I always remembered from [Hilary Hinton] "Zig" Ziglar who said that if you can do the things that you have to do when you have to do 'em, eventually you can do the things that you want to do when you want to do 'em.  And so I, I, that's what I try to tell my kids.  Do the things that you have to do and then get them done at a high level and then eventually you can turn around and do the things that you want to do.
Story_ID: 139026
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well tell us about your children, and, and your family.
Speaker 2: Family, mom [Julia Troutman Cherry] is still alive eighty-six years old.  We're, we're, we are very happy about that.  Still sharp, still driving you know her car except at night when she doesn't wanna go anywhere.  My brother [HM Dr. Glenn W. Cherry] is again my CEO, he's married, been married twenty-five, thirty years now to his wife Dr. Valerie Rawls Cherry.  I have a nephew, Jamal Cherry, who just graduated from Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York] with a, an engineering degree who's now in Stanford [University, Stanford, California] at, at, in a master's program.  I think it's in petroleum engineering and a M.B.A.  So he's a, he's a smart kid, I mean not kid, a young man, very proud of him.  I'm married to Lisa Rogers Cherry, who is a graduate of Spelman College [Atlanta, Georgia] and from University of Florida [Gainesville, Florida] with a also with a Juris Doctor, who, who actually is the administrator of this beautiful church and so she allowed us to come here.  I had to pay her a little bit for it, but so that's what you have to do.  My daughter is Chayla Cherry.  She's fourteen just started high school this year.  She's in band and in volleyball and is at the age of fourteen, no thirteen, fourteen, she'll be fourteen this year, five feet eleven and you know 130 some odd pounds.  So we put a volleyball in her hand and hopefully she'll go get a scholarship and save dad from having to spend that money.  My son Charles [Charles W. Cherry III] is ten.  He's in fifth grade, smart.  He's in the martial arts, and plays a little baseball.  And I'm, I'm an older father so I, I get mistaken for a grandfather all the time but that's, that's good and now I know I'll be a different father if I were a younger man 'cause I raise 'em like grandkids.  I'm, I'm yelling and pointing and sitting, while I'm sitting down instead of grabbing 'em, but I'm past that point where I have to grab 'em I'm thankful for that.  We did have a, a middle child who was stillborn, Chip Cherry, who would, would be Chip would be nine years old now had, had she lived, no eleven years old.  And that sort of, that experience actually one of your questions was what's one of the challenges that one of the biggest challenges that you face, that was a real challenge to see that, that child come out and not be breathing and my book 'Grief and Words' comes from me essentially eulogizing her.  And so that's, that's my family, and we consider her a part of the family even though she never drew breath.  The kids, we visit her, her grave every year.  My kids sort of consider her as to be a, a middle sister almost.  But I'm, I'm, I've--life has been very good.  I hope I have more.  I think I still have something to give to, to the world.  And I'm just I'm having a great time with, with all the challenges that we have faced in challenges particularly in the, in the, in the light of my father's [Charles W. Cherry, Sr.] death and just like the president [HM President Barack Obama] start to go gray right after he, he was elected president, I started going gray after my father died.  'Cause we had to really pick up from where a key man has left off and you know he was the really the foundation of the family and you when that happens from a business perspective and from a personal perspective you feel like the ground is sort of shaking under you.  But we've been able as a family I think to, to move forward and to thrive in a way that would have probably made him very proud.
Speaker 1: As you stated before, your mother is working full time.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, she's, she's working with me in the, in the company, but basically what she does is sort of keep us in check and don't let us make you know decisions without checking with her first.  So yeah, yeah, she's, she's doing her thing and you know, it's interesting that my father didn't really use her as, as, as the kind of asset that we do.  Because from a perspective I mean he was a black man, you a black woman I mean you know.  Hey you take care of the kids, that's, that's your thing.  But what we, what we, but what we notice with her that the questions that she ask are not direct business questions they're common sense questions that you have to answer before you make serious decisions.  So we've learned to sort of lean on her to say, "Mom this is what we're thinking about doing.  What do you think about this?"  And she's not gonna give you an M.B.A. answer, she's not gonna give you a legal answer, she's gonna give you a common sense answer and the question is probably gonna be as difficult as, as one you would get from anybody with one of those degrees.
Story_ID: 139027
Speaker 1: All right.  And once again, when you look back over your career and everything you've done, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I think my legacy is probably thoughtfulness and mind--mindfulness.  I try to live a mindful life and something that notices details.  I've, I've tried to get people to think differently from what they have been sort of trained particularly in, in the American educational system to think.  I've tried to get people to sort of open their minds because again you know as I told you I've always remember what George Clinton, Parliament, "Free your mind and your ass will follow."  If you can, if you can begin but part of freeing your mind is, is to be able and, and being willing to question the assumptions that you have about what you been taught, the things that you see, the things that you hear and to look around you and notice the nuances in the details.  So if I--over, over my journalistic career and I even my career as an attorney and doing the things that I've done in, in, in my family owned businesses, I think if I can get the folks who have had--who have had in contact with me--have contacted me to question and to ask questions and to begin to think strategically, I think I mean that's a great legacy.  I mean in addition to the kids and the writing and the book and all the rest of that kind of stuff but that, that would be my, my best I think my favorite personal legacy which is just to get people to think.  That's all.
