Speaker 1: Our very special HistoryMakers guest today is Ms. Marla Gibbs [HistoryMaker Marla Gibbs].  Ms. Gibbs, we welcome you to The HistoryMakers, ma'am, we welcome you (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Thank you.
Speaker 1: First of all, I'd like to ask you, did you sign the release form?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: All right. Please--
Speaker 2: And that was one of the things I faxed back.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Can you please tell us your full name at birth, and spell it?
Speaker 2: Margaret Bradley, M-A-R-G-A-R-E-T, B-R-A-D-L-E-Y, no middle initial.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm the only girl in the family that did not have a middle name.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us, what is today's date, ma'am?
Speaker 2: Today is July 8, 2007.
Speaker 1: All right.  And what is your date of birth?
Speaker 2: Six, fourteen, nineteen thirty-one [June 14, 1931].
Speaker 1: So, June 14, 1931.  You just had a birthday.
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Congratulations.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: Where were you born, ma'am?
Speaker 2: Chicago, Illinois, Cook County Hospital [John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital of Cook County].
Speaker 1: Cook County Hospital in Chicago, Illinois.  Okay.  You don't happen to know what time were you born?
Speaker 2: I think it was 5:44 A.M.
Speaker 1: A.M., 5:44 A.M.  You came and started the day out all right for somebody (laughter).  Had a whole day out here. Where did you grow up at?
Speaker 2: I grew up on 31st Street in Chicago, well, not on 31st Street--3136 Vernon [Avenue], in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay. Is that on the South Side?
Speaker 2: The corner of 32nd [Street], South Side, yes.
Speaker 1: South Side, Chicago.
Speaker 2: Around the corner from Olivet Baptist Church [Chicago, Illinois], which I think is still standing.
Speaker 1: Oh, is there anything significant about this church, Olivet Baptist Church?
Speaker 2: Well, when I was a kid, when I was in grammar school, I'd go there to play after school, even though I was going to Catholic school [Corpus Christi School, Chicago, Illinois].  I would go there, and they had a gym.  They had basketball, they had everything there.  I was a tomboy, so I was only interested in what the boys were interested in, which was basketball, ping pong, things like that.  And so, they had boys and girls, and there was a man, Mr. Jim Brown [ph.], who was like a counselor, and he was the head of the center, and he was so nice.  He would take us--I didn't realize how phenomenal it was at that time--he would take us to his house, he would take the boys sometimes, sometimes take the girls, and give us Cokes [Coca-Cola] and cookies and sandwiches, and sit down and talk to us and ask us questions, and we could ask him anything we wanted to ask.  So, he was like a mentor.
Speaker 1: So, you had a Jim Brown in your life many, many years before the other Jim Brown came along (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. Right. And then, he used to take the boys out to vacant lots to play baseball, and we, of course, would go to cheer them on, and then if they were winning, we'd be ready before the last run to really start running, because if we won, then the girls would want to beat us up (laughter).  And then they took us to Altgeld Gardens [Altgeld Gardens Homes, Chicago, Illinois], I remember that, on the bus.  And the girls who were for the other team would try to intimidate us.  So, it was rough (laughter), but it was fun.  You had to run for the bus, and you better not miss it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Where are we today?
Speaker 2: Today, we are at the Hilton, (laughter) and I'm sitting across from Ron Brewington [HistoryMaker Ronald H. Brewington] being interviewed.
Story_ID: 420858
Speaker 1: Now, here are some of the crazy little questions they ask us to ask.  These are what they call People magazine questions.  What is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: I would say my favorite food would have to be salmon.
Speaker 1: Why salmon?
Speaker 2: Well because it's heart healthy and I like salmon a lot, and the traditional black folks' food, chicken--
Speaker 1: I notice you didn't say chitterlings in there, I didn't see that either.
Speaker 2: No pork.
Speaker 1: No pork?
Speaker 2: No pork.  I haven't had pork in over thirty years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What is your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Ah, I don't think I have just one.
Speaker 1: Go for it.
Speaker 2: Beige, white, black, pink, purple, and red.  When I was younger, my favorite color was red. Whenever my mother [Ophelia Kemp Cady] sent a gift, when she sent sweaters, the blue one was always my sister's, the red one was automatically mine.
Speaker 1: That's a lot of colors you like--beige, white, black, pink.  Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: I like earth tones, generally.  Green, I didn't say green, green too.  At one point, I guess I thought red was too loud, too out there, brought too much attention.  So, when I was growing up, I switched to gray and black. I didn't want to be noticed (laughter).
Speaker 1: What is your favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: I would have to say summer now.  I used to say spring.  But spring is unpredictable now.
Speaker 1: Especially with this crazy warming that we got, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, it's too cold.
Speaker 1: Yes.  What is your favorite vacation spot?
Speaker 2: I don't really vacation.
Speaker 1: Okay, what is your imaginary vacation spot (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'd have to say, maybe Maui [Hawaii].
Speaker 1: Oh, Maui, love me some Maui. Been out there many times.
Speaker 2: Maui and Nassau [Bahamas].
Speaker 1: And Nassau?
Speaker 2: Because I've been to those places, and they're really nice.
Speaker 1: They say Nassau's gone funky, and Nassau's got soul.  Nice place to be, yes.  What is your favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Stay in the now.
Story_ID: 420859
Speaker 1: Can you tell us your favorite, your earliest, sights, smells and sounds that you can recall?
Speaker 2: The sights would have to be 31st Street and Vernon [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois].  The smells (pause)--smells and what else?
Speaker 1: And sounds.
Speaker 2: Sounds.  The sound of music.
Speaker 1: Any kind of special music?
Speaker 2: Jazz, it would have to be jazz.  Everything was jazz then.
Speaker 1: But, no smells that you would remember?  Any special smells?  Momma's [Ophelia Kemp Cady] cooking, pie or cake?
Speaker 2: That wasn't going on in my house (laughter).
Story_ID: 420860
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your mother.  Her name was?
Speaker 2: Ophelia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Ophelia Kemp [Ophelia Kemp Cady], K-E-M-P.
Speaker 1: O-P-H- can you spell it?
Speaker 2: O-P-H-E-L-I-A.
Speaker 1: Kemp, K-E-M-P?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did she have a middle name?
Speaker 2: Birdie, B-I-R-D-I-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your mother, what do you remember about your first thoughts and remembrances about your mother?
Speaker 2: Her smell and her legs.  She used to come and visit, and we'd go up to South Park [South Parkway; Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive] to pick her up.  She'd ride in a cab, and we'd be looking at the legs to see her get out of the car (laughter).  And then she had a favorite perfume, Toujours Moi by Corday.  And she kept that perfume.
Speaker 1: Toujours Moi by Corday?
Speaker 2: Yes, it's T-O-U-J-O-U-R-S, M-O-I.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Your mother, early memories that you have of her, who was her mother's mother?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Your grandmother?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  When your mother was young, do you remember any of her background?  Did she tell you about her father?
Speaker 2: Well, her father was Theodore Kemp.
Speaker 1: Okay, Theodore Kemp.
Speaker 2: Yes, and he came from Waterproof, Louisiana, where she was born.
Speaker 1: Theodore Kemp, K-E-M-P.  And the city he came from was?
Speaker 2: Waterproof.
Speaker 1: Waterproof?
Speaker 2: Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Just like it says, Waterproof?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Interesting town.  How big is Waterproof?
Speaker 2: Very small, I think about seven hundred fifty people in the whole town, if that many.
Speaker 1: Near Louisiana, I mean near New Orleans [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: Not that far from New Orleans.  I never did know what that meant on my birth certificate, because I never heard about talk about Waterproof until I was in the club, and a lady came in, and she said, "I'm married to your cousin."  And I didn't know I had a cousin.  And the Strange family.  So, she invited me to come down to, what's the name, it was the Optimist Club [Optimist International]?  Anyway, they invited me to come down to speak and then she said, "We'll take you over."  So, it's not that far from Monroe, Louisiana.  So, I flew into Monroe and did that.  We stayed at the Chattanooga Choo Choo Hotel [Chattanooga, Tennessee].  It's a train actually outside the hotel and people can stay in the train, and it was really luxurious.  I'll never forgot that hotel.  It was really, really lovely.  And then we went over to Waterproof, and that was the first time I had, what do you call it, crawfish.
Speaker 1: Crawfish?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: They look like little lobsters.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I've never tasted them.  What do they taste like?
Speaker 2: They're pretty good.  I guess they taste a little like lobster.
Speaker 1: Do you take the head off, and you just eat the body (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: And pull the other stuff off?
Speaker 2: And some people boil them, and then some people, they suck the stuff out of the head.  I haven't done that (laughter).
Speaker 1: Your mother, Ophelia Birdie Kemp.  Do you remember when she was born, the date of her birth?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you remember or know of where she was born at?
Speaker 2: She was born in Waterproof.
Speaker 1: She was born in Waterproof, the same place as your grandfather?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she left there I guess when she was about four years old, so that's why I never heard of it, and she never talked about it.  She probably didn't have any recollection.
Story_ID: 420861
Speaker 1: Like you said, she had pretty legs?  You used to watch those legs?  And she had that smell about her?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was she an elegant lady?  Did she like to--
Speaker 2: She was an entrepreneur, what we know as an entrepreneur now.  She had a haberdashery shop, a men's haberdashery.  I know this from stories, and then, she was a singer on the radio.  So, she used to sing, and she could play two songs.
Speaker 1: Interesting.  And also had two stores--two songs, sang two songs.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know what those songs were?
Speaker 2: One was 'Mighty Lak' a Rose,' and I can't remember the other one.
Speaker 1: These are gospel songs, or just contemporary songs?
Speaker 2: Contemporary songs.
Speaker 1: Contemporary songs, okay.  What were some of the memories that you have of your mother [Ophelia Kemp Cady]?
Speaker 2: Well, she became a minister later.  I went to live with her when I was sixteen, then I left her and came back to Chicago [Illinois], and graduated from Phillips [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].  She was very elegant, a very pretty lady, and she ran the numbers (laughter), she headed up a numbers operation (laughter), and then she became a minister of the Guiding Light Church.  It was more of a spiritual church, like Prophet Jones [James F. Jones] was.
Speaker 1: When she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And she put most of the church--she was a radio salesman--she put some churches on the radio.  I think it was WGPR [WGPR Radio] in Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she also had a two-hour program herself, on Sunday and she had a program on Monday.  And she would take people to the water at Belle Isle [Belle Isle Park, Michigan].  They'd have a service down at Belle Isle.
Story_ID: 420862
Speaker 1: Numbers operation, huh?
Speaker 2: Um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That was--a lot of people don't understand what the importance was for numbers in the black community back in those days.
Speaker 2: It was very important.  Most of the people bought their homes with it.
Speaker 1: It's something that people didn't understand.  If you weren't living there at that time, you didn't know it.
Speaker 2: That's right, because I didn't know until I went there, because Chicago [Illinois] was policy.
Speaker 1: Which is the same thing?
Speaker 2: No, I think it's completely different.
Speaker 1: A little bit different?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But, the numbers runner--this was a person who remembered all these numbers.  You drop twenty-five cents, you get the (unclear)--and if you could strike it, you could make a lot of money for twenty-five cents.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yes you could.  It was thirty-five, sixty-five, I think.  You pay a dollar.  And I ran the books myself later, after I moved there, and you get a run-out, so you get a salary.  I might get thirty-five dollars a week, depending on the size of my clientele.  And, then if they hit, I can give them a discount, and if they hit, I get 10 percent of what they got.  So, if they get five hundred dollars, I get fifty dollars.  And people have their favorite numbers.  My mother's [Ophelia Kemp Cady] number was 234, I think it was.  Mine was 618.  And I remember mine came out on a holiday, and I was so upset because it came out on a holiday, and I didn't play it, and it came out the next week.  And everybody called me, "Oh I know you're rich," (laughter).  I was sick, I had to go to bed.
Speaker 1: What used to amaze me was the odds of the numbers, how you can hit it.  Some people would hit it one time, twice, two or three times, some people never hit it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  That's right.  It's like going to the racetrack.
Speaker 1: The numbers--I was born and raised in Harlem [New York, New York], and it was part of our lifestyle, was the numbers (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  Well, most of the people in Detroit [Michigan] bought big homes and everything, you know, working the numbers or they hit the numbers.  I know there was a guy at the Gotham Hotel [Detroit, Michigan] who hit the numbers for fifty thousand dollars or sixty thousand dollars, twice 'cause they had a lot of money.  Then I worked at the Gotham Hotel, and Sammy Davis [Sammy Davis, Jr.] and all them used to come through there.  I was on the switchboard.  And they played the numbers in there, they had a numbers book, so it was really something.
Speaker 1: It was.
Speaker 2: I was on the fringes of all of that. I was never in it, just on the fringes of it.
Speaker 1: But, it was part of our lifestyle, it was what we lived every day.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right. I mean, it's just us, as a people, we're very unique in some of the things that we do.  Like, as they say in the ghetto, there's always a liquor store on every corner, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, and I just saw Joanne Bratton [Joanne Jackson Wingate], who was married to the boxer, was it Johnny Bratton?
Speaker 1: I believe so.
Speaker 2: She was with [HistoryMaker] Berry Gordy.  They came to church on the last day, of O.C.'s [O.C. Smith] church, City of Angels [City of Angels Church of Religious Science, Los Angeles, California], and it was good to see her again.  She married a man named Wingate [Ed Wingate], and Wingate had a, he was a big numbers man in Detroit, then they moved to Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada], and he passed away.
Speaker 1: When you said numbers, you definitely caught my attention.  I hadn't heard that in a long, long time.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was a big thing.
Speaker 1: Yes ma'am, that was a big thing for us.  Like you say, it gave us hope.
Speaker 2: And for a while, I worked in the numbers, and I'd be running them at night, and then I would go around and pick them up, and I'd have a skirt that had pockets in it I had made.  It had pockets in it, and I'd put the books, you know, in there, all around when I pick them up, and then I'd take them to the house, and in the basement, I would run them.
Speaker 1: Sounds like something out of the movies.  It does.  Wow but that's what people had to do back in those days and they're still doing it now but back in those days they really--it meant a lot for us.  Yes.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: My mother [Mosetta Smalls] always told me about the numbers.  She made sure I knew about that. In fact, you ever heard of Small's Paradise in Harlem?
Speaker 2: No, I never was in New York [New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't go to New York until 1991.  Right after the 9/11 [September 11, 2001], I went there and worked on a show called 'Vagina Monologues' ['The Vagina Monologues,' Eve Ensler].  Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you did 'Vagina Monologues,' okay.  I'll come back to that a little bit later then.
Speaker 2: Off Broadway (laughter).
Speaker 1: Off Broadway, yes.  Off Broadway.
Story_ID: 420863
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your father for a moment.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay. You say you don't remember him?
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  I remember my father.  I grew up with my father (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay. And his name was?
Speaker 2: Douglas Bradley.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And now that I think about it, my father was somewhat of an entrepreneur also.  He taught himself to be a mechanic.  He had these books, and he became one of the best mechanics in the neighborhood.  Everybody would bring their car.  Attached to our house was a big garage, it was almost like an eight car garage. It was my grandmother bought Big Jim Colosimo's [James Colosimo] house from his father [Luigi Colosimo].  She lived next door to his father then, and I guess they became friends.  So, when Big Jim Colosimo was killed, his father's heart was broken, and he went back to Italy and he sold her the house, and she made it a rooming house.  So, that's what I grew up in.
Speaker 1: I hate to sound dumb, but I don't know the name Big Jim Colosimo.
Speaker 2: Well, do you know Capone [Al Capone]?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well, Colosimo was at the same time--he was another--but he was killed in a restaurant.
Speaker 1: In Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: No, in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: In Chicago.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Big Jim Colosimo. I've got to do my homework then.  Colosimo, he was a gangster, okay.  And your father, you say he raised you?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Do you remember his mother?
Speaker 2: Yes, she was there too.
Speaker 1: And her name?
Speaker 2: Hattie Sims.
Speaker 1: H-A-D-D?
Speaker 2: H-A-T-T-I-E, S-I-M-S.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you remember what her birthday was?
Speaker 2: They never had a birthday, and they never discussed their age, and they never discussed their birthday.
Speaker 1: Do you know where she was born at?
Speaker 2: No idea.  I think it must have been somewhere around Memphis [Tennessee] and Louisville [Kentucky], because she always talked about Louisville.  I'd hear her talking to other people about Louisville and Memphis.  So, I said she must have come from one of those places.  Nor do I know who my father's father was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Father unknown.
Speaker 2: I heard her mention Big Jim Bradley [ph.], but I never--they never answered questions like that, so you didn't ask.
Speaker 1: Do you remember where your father was born at?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head).
Speaker 1: Do you remember the date he was born, do you know his birthday?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head) I only know his age because in the kitchen one day, he said "I met your mother [Ophelia Kemp Cady] when she was sixteen, and I was twenty-five."  So, I think she had my sister [Frieda Rentie] when she was seventeen, so I figured I'd just start counting and figuring the age from that, and from when I was born, I figured out how old she would have been.  And she died in 1967--
Speaker 1: This your mother--
Speaker 2: --right after the riots.  My father died in 1947.
Speaker 1: Okay, your father died in 1947?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Do you know what he died from?
Speaker 2: He had a hernia, I heard hernia, but I think it might have been cancer, because nobody knew what the cancer was then.  They might say he died of consumption (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yes that was a word they used a lot back in those days, consumption.
Speaker 2: Right, you figure out, what was consumption?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: So, I figured, that must have been cancer.
Speaker 1: Yes, which is what we talk about now when you talk about cancer, you don't see people, men like they keep in their minds about the Tuskegee syphilis experiment [Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male]--those old days, those old diseases that were in our race.
Speaker 2: And he might have had prostate cancer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because he became an ice man, and he had a fleet of trucks, and he had drivers and he sat in the kitchen and he ran his books, and paid the drivers.  And he learned how to chip that ice, and they'd buy a big block of ice, maybe three hundred pounds, and they'd chip it into seventy-five pounds, fifty pounds, twenty-five pounds.  People had ice boxes, they didn't have refrigerators, so we would get the chips and we would like to eat those (laughter).  But he would carry those up the stairs, like three flights sometimes, on his back and I think that's how he got sick.
Story_ID: 420864
Speaker 1: Now, you also had a sister.  Her name was Susie Garrett.
Speaker 2: Susie was my mother's [Ophelia Kemp Cady] husband's daughter.  She was my stepsister.  My mother married Charles Cady, C-A-D-Y, and her and Charles started a numbers business, and Charles had two children, Donald [Donald Cady] and Susie.  Garrett was Susie's married name.  Their names was Donald and Susie Cady.  So, we met when she was like, fifteen, and we liked each other so we remained family even when they divorced.
Speaker 1: Now name the gentleman that your mother married after her divorce was Charles Cady?  C-A-D--?
Speaker 2: Y.
Speaker 1: C-A-D-Y. Okay, this was after she divorced your father [Douglas Bradley]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, that's when they moved to Detroit [Michigan], when she moved to Detroit.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your father and also your sister was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I guess I was like four.
Story_ID: 420865
Speaker 1: Now, your life is moving on, now you're up and around, running around in a little place called Chicago, Illinois, moving around.  Now, did you ever go to that place in Waterproof, Louisiana as a young child?
Speaker 2: Never.
Speaker 1: Never?
Speaker 2: I used to go to Racine.  My grandfather [Gibbs' maternal grandfather, Theodore Kemp] lived in Racine, Wisconsin, so I'd go there in the summer.  And we stayed with a cousin, Esther [ph.].  I guess she was on my grandfather's side, and my grandfather lived around the corner from her.  We stayed with her.  He had married again, and they had Hardick's [sic. Mr. Hardwick's] chocolate milk, and they used to come and deliver milk to the house and I liked the Hardick's chocolate milk, so they would always get that for me.  And she had also a tomato patch in the back.  And she had grapes overhead.  They made the Concord wine, so you could just sit there and pick grapes, and I'd get a basket of tomatoes. I love tomatoes, and I'd get some salt and sit there and eat tomatoes (laughter).
Story_ID: 420866
Speaker 1: As your life continued and you're living in Chicago [Illinois], and then in 1944 at the age of thirteen, you did something interesting.  You got married.
Speaker 2: No, I didn't.  I don't know where they got that from.  I have no idea where that came from.  At thirteen, I did not get married (laughter).  I was in St. Gregory--not St. Gregory, that's my children--I was in Corpus Christi School [Chicago, Illinois], graduating from grammar school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  My God, there's a lot of the wrong history running around.
Speaker 2: Yes, it is.  I was in shock when somebody asked me that question.  I said, "I have no idea where that came from."  Maybe somebody transposed the numbers somewhere.
Speaker 1: Well, did you get married at thirty-one?
Speaker 2: No.  I got married [to Jordan Gibbs, Sr.] at twenty-five.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Wow.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) So I have no idea.
Speaker 1: So, at age thirteen, you did not get married.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: I don't think you could get married at thirteen, not in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Not in Chicago, no. I was going to say not in Chicago (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm sure in the South some places you could.
Speaker 1: Oh yes, yes.  You did not get married.  Instead, you graduated from Corpus Christi?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Is that elementary school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. In Chicago? Elementary school (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Chicago, 49th [Street] and South Park [South Parkway; Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive].
Speaker 1: Wow.  Sometimes for example when you use IMDb [Internet Movie Database], or Wikipedia, or some things like that, they'll have these little statistics, and on both of them, they said yes.  You know, we need to get you some information to have them change that, because that's something you want (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't even know who they are.
Speaker 1: Well, I can get that information for you, ma'am.  Google and Wikipedia, is what they call it.  Because I referred to both of them, and they both said--
Speaker 2: I never know where they get this stuff from.  I never have been a fan of those things.  They give out my address, they give out things they should not give out.  I get all kinds of mail at my house.  If I was not in a secure community, people can come to your house--you know you can be stalked very easily.
Speaker 1: Very easily, yes.  You go up on some of these websites and you put your telephone number in there and they can get your address.  It's not safe.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  No, it's not.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Do you keep a big dog around your house?
Speaker 2: No, but then, I'm in a guard gated community, so they'd have to come past them.  Someone could probably think of an elaborate lie to get in (laughter), but I'm not that important, so (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes you are.
Speaker 2: I don't worry about it. I just go where I want to go.
Story_ID: 420867
Speaker 1: Here's another fact that they said, okay.  Now, you didn't get married at thirteen, they said that you had three children by the age of twenty.
Speaker 2: I had my first child at twenty-three (laughter).
Speaker 1: That was Angela Elayne [Angela Elayne Gibbs] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, right.
Speaker 1: First had--let me make a note here.  Had first child at twenty-three, and that was a daughter?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Angela Elayne?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And where is Angela right now?
Speaker 2: Angela right now is at the mall with my grandson [Amilcar Gibbs] (laughter).  She's picking up some shoes because he's going to a wedding at five [o'clock].
Speaker 1: She lives here in Los Angeles [California]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: And then later, you had a son, Dorian Demetrius Gibbs [Dorian Gibbs]?
Speaker 2: No, later I had Jordan Joseph Gibbs [Jordan Gibbs, Jr.], named after my husband [Jordan Gibbs, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Okay, and you had him when (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At twenty-five.
Speaker 1: Had your second child at twenty-five.  I say these historians, we didn't do our work here (laughter).  And that was a son, Jordan?
Speaker 2: Jordan Joseph Gibbs.
Speaker 1: Nice name, Jordan.  I have a daughter named Jordan [Jordan Brewington].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yes.  And what is Mr. Gibbs (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He's the fourth.
Speaker 1: The fourth?  Okay.  And what does Mr. Gibbs do now?
Speaker 2: Jordan?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: He's a real estate broker.
Speaker 1: In L.A. [Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Lives in L.A., and a real estate broker in L.A.?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Then you had your third child.
Speaker 2: In 1963.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Dorian Demetrius.
Speaker 1: And how old were you at that time?
Speaker 2: How old was I?  Well if you subtract sixty-three from thirty (laughter)--thirty-one from sixty-three, I had to be thirty-two.
Speaker 1: Thirty-two, okay.  And that was a son, Dorian?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: D-O-R-I-A-N, Demetrius?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Gibbs.  And where is Dorian now?
Speaker 2: Dorian is here. Dorian is a real estate investor.
Speaker 1: Real estate investor.  He lives also here in the city?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And an inventor.
Speaker 1: Ma'am?
Speaker 2: An inventor.
Speaker 1: He's an inventor?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What has he ever invented?
Speaker 2: He invented an office product that you attach to a desk, and it has, there's like a middle post and then it has three--you can attach prongs to it, so one holds a bottle of water, a liter bottle, the other one you can put your cup of coffee in, and the third one has two compartments that you can put your post-it notes and your paperclips in.  So, it's like your desk is free.  And at first he fixed it for draft people, so you know, they're working at the draft table, they never spill anything.  As a matter of fact, people spill a lot of stuff in their computer, so that eliminates that.
Speaker 1: Has he made a lot of money off this invention?
Speaker 2: No (laughter).
Speaker 1: Is it out there in the street now?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we went to the city and everything, but their desks are so--they're old, and so he made one for the desktop for them.  But we never did really get a good investor for that, but he sold a lot of it--
Speaker 1: Excellent (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) but more to the craft people.
Story_ID: 420868
Speaker 1: So, three children.  How about grandchildren.  Do you have any grandchildren?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.  How many grandchildren do you have, ma'am?
Speaker 2: One.
Speaker 1: Just one?
Speaker 2: Only one productive child (laughter), that's my daughter.
Speaker 1: And this (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) His name is Amilcar [Amilcar Gibbs], A-M-I-L-C-A-R, Gibbs.
Speaker 1: And how old is this young man?
Speaker 2: He'll be the same age as me in August.  I'm thirty, and he'll be thirty on August 16, unless he decides to hop over or back up (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I like the way you said that, he'll be the same age as me.  And his mother is your daughter (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Angela [Angela Elayne Gibbs].
Speaker 1: It's Angela, okay.  And maybe if he was to hurry up now, you can get you a great-grandchild going.
Speaker 2: Oh, I've got two.
Speaker 1: You've got two great-grandchildren?  Oh, my goodness (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I have GGs.
Speaker 1: Oh, my goodness.
Speaker 2: We're not great-grand at thirty, so I have two GGs.  I have one GG son, and one GG daughter.  GG daughter is a year and two months, and GG son is eight.
Speaker 1: Eight years?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And the other one is one year, eight months?
Speaker 2: No, one year and two months.
Speaker 1: One year and two months, I'm sorry. And what is the GG son's name?
Speaker 2: GG is Sammy [Samuel Christian].
Speaker 1: S-A-M-M-Y?
Speaker 2: S-A-M-M-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Middle name?
Speaker 2: Sammy's a stepson, but not to us.
Speaker 1: His middle name is?
Speaker 2: I don't think he has a middle name.
Speaker 1: His last name is?
Speaker 2: What is his last name?  I don't have it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the daughter?
Speaker 2: Is Aila [Aila Gibbs], A-I-L-A, and no middle name.
Speaker 1: No middle name? The last name?
Speaker 2: Gibbs.
Speaker 1: Gibbs, okay.  And, they're all products of Amil Gibbs?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Amil and Adriana [Adriana Gibbs].
Speaker 1: Okay, his mother is Angela.
Speaker 2: Adriana, she's Hispanic--Beltran.  So, I guess--well, Sammy's name is not Beltran, he's named after his father.
Speaker 1: Okay, wow.  GG, that's nice, that's nice.
Speaker 2: He calls me GG Ma.  My grandson calls me G Ma.  The moment he got married, I said, "We better change this, with all friends--"; everybody calls me Grandma, so I said, "You all are too big and old to be calling me Grandma," so I said, "From now on, I'm G Ma (laughter)." So, they call me up and say, "Hey G Ma."
Speaker 1: Do they ever see you on TV?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: Do they ever see you on television?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And what do they say?
Speaker 2: Sammy said, "Grandma, you're famous, huh?"  And he has an agent now, very talented, and he raps.  My grandson is a music producer, and he makes beats, and now he's writing for R&B, so he also has a song on the Allstate [Allstate Corporation] commercial that's getting ready to go on, what do you call it--iTunes.
Speaker 1: Yes, iTunes yeah.  Eight years old, and he's a songwriter already?
Speaker 2: No, no, that's my grandson.
Speaker 1: Oh, your grandson, oh I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but that's where he gets it from, because he shows you how to do the music and everything.  So he raps.  So, he did raps for the producer, I mean, for my agent, and he almost got thrown off, because Aila, she seemed to know that he was auditioning, and she wanted him to pay attention to her, so she did everything she could to distract him (laughter).  (Makes sounds) She bounced up and down and did everything, and he never--Angela said, "I was so proud of him, he never got distracted, he kept right on rapping (laughter)."  So we're getting their pictures made.

Speaker 1: When was the last time the Gibbs family got together for a reunion?
Speaker 2: On my birthday.
Speaker 1: This year?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: How big was it?
Speaker 2: We just went to dinner.  We have a thing where on everybody's birthday we go to dinner together.  So, we went to McCormick and Schmick's [McCormick and Schmick's Seafood Restaurants, Inc.] because they were downstairs from my agent, and I had been to them when I did a show in Kansas, and I was very impressed, so we went there and everybody had a good time.  Dick Anthony Williams joined us, and Angela's [Angela Elayne Gibbs] friend, Eileen Hunter [ph.] joined us, and Berlinda came, Berlinda Tolbert, from 'The Jeffersons.'  She's like family, so she was there.  And of course, Aila [Aila Gibbs] and Sammy [Samuel Christian] and Adriana [Adriana Gibbs] and Amil [Amilcar Gibbs] and Dorian [Dorian Gibbs], Joey [Jordan Gibbs, Jr.] and Angela.
Speaker 1: Sounds like you ladies had a great time.
Speaker 2: We did.
Speaker 1: Outstanding. Oh birthdays.
Speaker 2: And then of course, every holiday we get together.
Speaker 1: When you say holiday, that means like 4th (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Thanksgiving and Christmas.
Speaker 1: Thanksgiving, Christmas.  Okay.  4th of July?
Speaker 2: Not the 4th of July.
Speaker 1: I was upset this year, and I'm sure a lot of people were, because the 4th of July was on a Wednesday.
Speaker 2: Just it was too hot, too hot, and you can't cook out in Briarwood [Briarwood Canyon, California], anyway, around there.  And everybody had someplace to go.  I didn't want to go anywhere.
Story_ID: 420870
Speaker 1: So, now, you're--you weren't married at thirteen (laughter) didn't have those kids so let's go back, let's see if we can get back on line here.  Then, in 1945, according to our records, at the age of fourteen, you went to school in Chicago [Illinois] at Wendell Phillips High School [Wendell Phillips Academy High School]?  Correct?
Speaker 2: No, I went to St. Elizabeth [St. Elizabeth Catholic School, Chicago, Illinois] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, let's get that straight.  So, at the age of fourteen, you went to St. Elizabeth high school--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in Chicago?
Speaker 2: In Chicago, for two years.
Speaker 1: St. Elizabeth high school for two years?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That's freshman and sophomore year?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then you transferred to?
Speaker 2: I transferred to Wendell Phillips for a half year.
Speaker 1: Just a half year?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then I went to Detroit [Michigan] to Northern High School, which was sort of an international high school.  We had kids there from Italy and Germany, and different places.
Speaker 1: Could you repeat the name of that school again, ma'am?
Speaker 2: Northern.
Speaker 1: Northern.  So, you graduated from Northern High School?
Speaker 2: No, that's when I went to stay with my mother [Ophelia Kemp Cady].  I was at Northern about a year, and then I went back to Chicago and graduated from Wendell Phillips.  That's why nobody really remembers me.
Speaker 1: I see.  So, let me see if I have this right.  At the age of fourteen, you went to St. Elizabeth high school for two years?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Then you transferred to Wendell Phillips High School for half a year?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Then you went to Detroit's Northern High School for?
Speaker 2: A year.
Speaker 1: One year.  And then?
Speaker 2: I went back to Phillips.
Speaker 1: Then returned to Phillips.  For graduation?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in June of 1949, that's when I graduated.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Graduated high school in June of 1949.  Okay.  God, I'm going to have to shoot those people (laughter).  June of 1949, okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: While you were in school, what do you remember about being in high school?  Since you had such--let's start with St. Elizabeth.  What do you remember about being at St. Elizabeth?
Speaker 2: I was taking Latin.  I liked Latin.  I wanted to take French after two years of Latin, but they made me stay in Latin (pause), which would have been good if Latin was still being spoken, but the priest stopped speaking Latin, and it became obsolete, then I forgot it.
Speaker 1: I share the same thought. I was a Catholic, and they were speaking Latin, then they stopped doing it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so it's fine in church, because you understand everything they're saying, you know, and the prescriptions, but nobody writes prescriptions in Latin anymore.  So, it's just not used.  And see French would have served me so much better if I'd been able in my junior year to move to French.
Story_ID: 420871
Speaker 1: Now you said you were a tomboy when you were younger.  Were you still a tomboy back around this age now, when you were in high school?
Speaker 2: Not so much.
Speaker 1: A little makeup, a little lipstick, a little eye shadow every now and then?
Speaker 2: Nah.
Speaker 1: No?  What was it like for you then?
Speaker 2: I was kind of a recluse, I suppose, and shy.  My dogs were my favorite--anybody's dog (laughter).  I used to sit on my porch and a dog would come down the street, and he would come right up on the porch and sit next to me.  My folks [Ophelia Kemp Cady and Gibbs' stepfather, Charles Cady] would come out, "Where did that dog come from?" They were afraid to come out.  So, I had an affinity with dogs; that was my main thing.  I wanted to be was somebody who saved all the, what do you call 'em--
Speaker 1: The strays?
Speaker 2: The stray dogs, yeah.
Speaker 1: Got you. Special attention to stray dogs, okay.  Now beside Latin at St. Elizabeth [St. Elizabeth Catholic School, Chicago, Illinois], did you get involved with sports of any type?  No sports? No yearbook committee, no extracurricular--?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head) None of those things.
Speaker 1: Then you left and you went--now, you're leaving St. Phillips [sic.].  What made you leave St. Phillips, I mean St. Elizabeth, I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: Well, they had book reports, and I had done all my book reports ahead of time, and I had to choose from a certain list, and the list didn't come out.  So, they took the book report in, but then she didn't give me a grade, so I got upset, and so I decided to leave.  And, you know, they were not going to pass me if I left the school, so I didn't think that was fair, so I left and went to Phillips [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].  And so, I was taking two grades at Phillips at the same time.  So, I did very well.
Speaker 1: Did you, during those times, did you go to football games, basketball games, or things like that?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Nothing at all?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not until my kids went to school in Detroit [Michigan], then I went to all the basketball games.  My son was on the team, and then I'd go--my daughter [Angela Elayne Gibbs] was on a team, she was good.  My son was on a team, so I would go to both of their games, and then their friends would play and then they would want me to come see their brother play, so I was like basketball all day (laughter).
Story_ID: 420872
Speaker 1: Then you went back to--at Northern High School [Detroit, Michigan], you're now back in Northern High School now.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Again, no basketball, nothing?
Speaker 2: No basketball.  I was in a group that went out to different schools to help with the younger children.  I don't know what that was called, now that I think back.  But me and another girl were picked to go, and so we'd go out to different grammar schools, and I don't remember what we did, I just remember going.
Speaker 1: At that time in your life, did you ever have a feeling or thought about being an actress, or doing any acting at that time?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't.  It wasn't around me.  I was, I loved the movies, I lived in the movies, and I never was interested that much in television, I'd rather be outside doing things.  I used to play baseball in Chicago [Illinois] on the parking lot, and I liked to play left field because I liked to run for the ball.
Speaker 1: Left field was your favorite base?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But television was kind of new back in those days. If you could (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, a lot of people were, you know, there was a lady that had it at my grandmother's house, and I never was interested in going up there and looking.  It wasn't the same as the movies, you know.  It's still not the same as the movies, and it's not in a class with the movies.  'Cause I remember we were up for going to where they buy the movies, and buy the TV shows, and we were in a hotel, and so the producer said, "Go on in there because they're interviewing." And I went in there, and all the photographers and media just looked at me and kept on talking, until somebody from a movie came in, then they all turned around.  So, I said, "Oh, they're not waiting for me (laughter)."  That's when I really found out the difference.
Speaker 1: Because television was just starting to come into, I mean, it was replacing radio.
Speaker 2: Now this was when I was on 'The Jeffersons.'
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: They were trying to send me in to get some press.  The press was not interested.  If it had been a television thing, they would have been.  But there were television people and film people, so they were only interested in the film people, they were bigger, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But when we go back into your high school time, around the 1949-ish era, television was just getting started about that time.
Speaker 2: There was nothing about television that I knew of.
Speaker 1: That you knew of.  We were listening to radio at that time.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: A lot of radio.  But one of the things--did you ever listen to any special radio shows like--?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Such as?
Speaker 2: 'The Hermit's Cave,' and 'I Love a Mystery,' and spookies (laughter).  And we would say, they'd say, "Turn out your lights, turn them out."  And, we'd turn out the lights.  They had a little string attached, and we had bunk beds, and I was on the top bunk bed.  We'd turn them out, and then we'd be scared (laughter).  We'd reach out and turn them back on.
Speaker 1: What about 'Amos 'n' Andy'?  Did you ever listen to that show?
Speaker 2: I never listened to 'Amos 'n' Andy,' not until they were on TV.  It was much later, when I saw them on television, and I thought he was really funny.
Speaker 1: What do you think of the fact--even though you didn't listen to it, but I'm sure you heard about it--(cough) excuse me--what do you think of the fact that 'Amos 'n' Andy' were these two white guys?
Speaker 2: I never knew that until much earlier, after the 'Amos 'n' Andy' show was off, and they were showing it, you know.  But now that I realize we're all one, creativity just comes where it comes, you know, and you can't argue about that, because God sends out--whoever sends out--everybody can do it, you know.  Sometimes it's not accepted where you want to do it.  But, you can't decide where.
Story_ID: 420873
Speaker 1: --You know, it's like [HistoryMaker] Cathy Hughes, she wanted to start a radio program and then she wanted to start a TV show, and she got that done.  And I've always said, with all the numbers out there, we have enough money--if you can't do it here--why can't you do that?  And I sort of did that when I had the theater in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], because I bought the theater, and there were so many programs in the community.  A lot of kids weren't on the street because they had programs to go to.  And then Prop 13 passed, was it thirteen or seventeen--thirteen, under Ronald Reagan [Ronald Wilson Reagan] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Proposition 13.
Speaker 1: And all of the programs went away, and all of the kids went onto the streets.  Then you had the latchkey kids, there was nothing for them to do.  So, I wondered why the non-profits couldn't have kept the buildings and kept the programs going, why couldn't somebody put some money in? But we were so busy arguing about the money being gone.  So, my thing was, always you have to do it yourself, and I was always told, use other's people's money.  I said, "Well, why are you upset when it starts becoming important, and other people take it, and you have no money invested, it's not yours anymore, not if you don't believe in it, you know."  So, I had a problem when I started Crossroads [Crossroads Arts Academy and Theater, Los Angeles, California] and then when I started the Vision [Vision Theatre, Los Angeles, California] because I bought the theater.  Everybody felt like--not everybody--but a lot of people felt like I should have done it under the city, you know.  "Why don't you give this building to the city, and let them take care of you?"  And I said, "Maybe God wants me to do something."  But, it was a lack of vision, I named it the Vision, but it was a lack of vision that caused me to lose it, because, if you believe in something, you keep it going, and then it goes on and on.  But, if the city has to take care of you, you can't depend on that. So, I don't know, I got disenchanted.
Speaker 2: It's a rough business.
Speaker 1: And one problem was, when I did put the money in, the show cancelled like before I closed the escrow, and they said, "Well, you're not going to do it now, are you?"  And I said, "Well, yeah, God wants to know how serious I am."  But, God was saying no, no (laughter), but I didn't know that.  God does not play games.  Of course, we had the riots behind Rodney King and then we had the earthquake, the big earthquake where the freeway fell, and suddenly I was having trouble.  I had to spend so much money before I could even touch a child, so although I had a summer program, I had to pay for all that stuff myself.  And I stayed there--I lasted nine years, but then I lost the facility, you know.  So, I was looking for 3 million people with a dollar or one person with $3 million, then I said when you divide it up, it's really not a lot of people.  It doesn't take a lot of money, but you can't be good at waving your hand and waving your fist.  And your hand got to be, at some point, be able to go down in your pocket and pull out some money.  But we can do that, but we can't do this, so, it gets to be a problem.
Story_ID: 420874
Speaker 1: You mentioned something that is close to a lot of people's heart.  You mentioned when you talk to God, you have a relationship with God.  Do you want to talk about that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, definitely, definitely.  I talk to God all day long.  My sister [Susie Garrett] says, "Nobody can talk to God, because you're so busy."  (Laughter) I said, "That's their problem."  I said, "God talks to everybody."  And, that is my closest friend, my confidant and my source.  We were going to a restaurant and my girlfriend was in town with her daughter, and I invited my sister because she knew her, too.  And we were going up on Melrose [Avenue], and I said, okay, it's hard to park around there.  So, I said to God, "Thank you for our parking space, thank you. Always go ahead of me and make my way safe, traffic less and ticketless, and thank you for a parking space, and I'd like one close, thank you."  So, we got there, and my sister said, "Isn't that something how we found a parking space for three cars."  I said, "Yes, I called ahead."  So, she said, "Oh you called, who did you call?"  I said, "God."  I said, "You sit in church every Sunday.  What are you listening to?  You know, you can ask for what you want.  I asked for parking places, it doesn't matter, whatever.  I put it out there, and I say thank you, because I know it's done."  And, sometimes things are not meant to be, and you accept that, and it's for your greater good, and you understand that as time passes, you know.  I know when I was losing the Vision [Vision Theatre, Los Angeles, California], I stepped--as I was locking the door for the last time, I had a big sign that was up--it wasn't as big as it was supposed to be--and I turned around and looked and I said, "I don't understand, why?" So, God said, "There's no vision here."  And I said, "Oh."  And just like that, I accepted it.  And then, I said, "Boy, God is awesome," because as I passed there, it was like I was never there.  I never connected with all the time, all the work, all the money I spent, it was just, I pass there now, and it was like I was never there.  I have no connection.   I accepted it and that was it.  And it was phenomenal to me that I accepted it that easy.  But then, I learned never to look back, you know.  So, you learn as you go.  If you stay in the now, things are revealed.  God said, "Be still and I will reveal all things to you.  I will not reveal it to somebody else to tell you, I will reveal to you."  So, God talks to everybody, but everybody, they just don't listen, they don't hear it.  We want somebody that we can see to tell us, so we go to that person, and then when that person disappoints us, that gives us a reason not to have faith.  But it's not the messenger, it's the message, so when we lost those things, we remembered that, you know.  So, it doesn't really matter who's out there, everybody has something to say to you.

Speaker 1: --Ben Vereen came--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and he started having service.  Now he's opening a church. As a matter of fact, I was supposed to go there this morning, but I didn't.  I went to a wedding dinner last night, and I was up late, and I didn't feel like--I got up early and then I didn't feel good, so I laid back down, and I said I'm not going to make it.
Speaker 2: God has been good to you, hasn't he?
Speaker 1: Very good.  Last October, I had an aneurysm, and two brain surgeries and a stroke, and I came out walking and talking, so they said I took pretty good care of myself, and why that's why I survived so well.  And all of my children just really picked up and took care of me.  My daughter [Angela Elayne Gibbs] became my mother (laughter), and my sons [Jordan Gibbs, Jr. and Dorian Gibbs]--everybody was right there for me.
Speaker 2: You had a stroke?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Well, when they did the second--when they got through with the first surgery, they had to go back in, so they forced me into a stroke, so that I wouldn't have a massive stroke.  I don't know the background of that, but that's what they told my daughter, so I accepted that.  And my grandson [Amilcar Gibbs] said, "You are doing remarkable, Grandma."  He said, "We would say something to you and you would answer and go right back off, and we didn't know if you were ever going to be able to--."  And, see I had no knowledge of any of that.
Speaker 2: God has been good to you.
Speaker 1: He really has.
Speaker 2: You look beautiful, you look wonderful.
Speaker 1: Thank you.  Well for a while, I looked in the mirror, and I didn't know who that lady was.  I said, "Maybe it's time, I don't know (laughter)."
Speaker 2: Oh God.
Speaker 1: My children have just been remarkable.  It was worth getting sick just to see them step to the plate like that, you know.
Speaker 2: There's a lady who's always with you every time I see you.
Speaker 1: That's my sister, Frieda [Frieda Rentie], my youngest sister (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's your sister, Ah.  Spell her name.
Speaker 1: Frieda F-R-I-E-D-A, Rentie, R-E-N-T-I-E.  We have the same mother [Ophelia Kemp Cady], different fathers.
Speaker 2: And she's your sister.  Every time I see you, I see her.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: You guys are always together.  How is she doing, by the way?
Speaker 1: She's doing great.
Speaker 2: Outstanding.
Speaker 1: She went with us last night.
Speaker 2: Gosh, I'm taken back by what you said about the stroke.  Wow that news never got out.
Speaker 1: No, my daughter made sure it didn't get out, because she knew I wanted to work, and you know how they can exaggerate things.  They'll say I'm dead (laughter), dying or whatever.  And it was past--

Speaker 1: I came out and did a movie, I did 'Afro Ninja,' which hasn't come out yet.  I did that movie, so I was blessed.  And now my grandson [Amilcar Gibbs] is trying to find a way to have my CD released, because I just did a CD last year, called 'It's Never Too Late.'
Speaker 2: Singing or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Singing, singing jazz.  [HistoryMaker] H. B. Barnum was the music producer.
Speaker 2: I've never heard of that H. B. Barnum (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I'm sure you have (laughter).
Speaker 2: We call him H for short.  What a guy, what a guy.
Speaker 1: He's so fantastic.  I mean, he put those tracks together.  I couldn't believe it.  I love ballads.  He put those tracks together, and I wrote some music.  I'd never written before, and my grandson said, "I can't believe it, you're writing."  My daughter [Angela Elayne Gibbs] and everybody said, "Where'd you get that from?"  I said, "I don't know, God just gave it to me."  If you say you want to do something, if you make a step, God will make two.  And my grandson said, "You know, Grandma it would be hip, if you put some words to one of my tracks."  So, I said, "Bring your tracks over," and I said I don't know how I'm going to do this, because when my songs would come to music, the words and everything comes.  So, I listened to his tracks and I came up with words to two of them, so we put those on the CD, so I have five songs on there.  On two, he did the music for, and I did the words, and on three I did the words and music.
Speaker 2: And what is the name of the CD, ma'am?
Speaker 1: 'It's Never Too Late.'
Speaker 2: That's the message right there in itself.
Speaker 1: And it's on Forever 30 Records so--
Speaker 2: And it's due out when?
Speaker 1: Hm?
Speaker 2: It's due out when?
Speaker 1: Well, it's been out, but it's independent, so my grandson is now hooking me up with distributors and everything since he's a music producer, and it's always been on his mind.  So, I said, all right, so I'm just letting him work it and see where we go.  Then, I have to get back in voice again because there's--I started getting an excessive amount of saliva when I'm talking, it's getting better now.  But I didn't like what my voice sounds--you know, so my singing hasn't come back yet, so now I'm working on my vocal exercises again, because if I start going around touring, I'm going to have to be able to sing as well as talk, and I want to be back in good voice.  So, I'm beginning to feel like they said--everybody says, "Well, you know it hasn't been that much time since you came out of the hospital."  Two days before Christmas.
Speaker 2: Of what year?
Speaker 1: This year.
Speaker 2: This year?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Well 2006.
Speaker 2: Two thousand six [2006], yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 420877
Speaker 1: Then I was in, in rehabilitation, so I got released from that, I think in April.  So it just seems--it doesn't seem like a long time to everybody else, but it seems like it to me.  But everybody keep saying it usually takes a year or something, so I said, okay (laughter).  Yeah, so now I'm in driving rehab.
Speaker 2: Driving a car?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Of course, I came over here. I got my times confused, my date confused.  My daughter [Angela Elayne Gibbs] kept saying, "You said you had something to do."  I said, "I don't know what it is," (laughter).  I'm laying up there looking at the Wimbledon [The Championships, Wimbledon, London, England]--Federer [Roger Federer], and of course he beat Nadal [Rafael Nadal] in the fifth set.  But I was really pulling for Nadal, because he hasn't won one.  Everybody's been getting upset, except Venus [Venus Williams] got it.  They were expecting her to get it--she got it.  Serena [Serena Williams] got wiped out in the first round.  So, I like watching tennis.
Speaker 2: Do you play it?
Speaker 1: (Shakes head).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Roxie [Roxie Roker], before she passed, Roxie got into wanting to do tennis, and of course, she always wanted me to go with her when she started something, because she knows I'm game.  So, first we went to Gold's Gym and worked out, then she said, "Let's do tennis."  So, we went, and [HistoryMaker] Oscar Robertson, who used to be a famous tennis player [sic.], he was coaching us, and all we did was kept missing the ball.  I said, "How come I can't hit this ball with this big racket?"  He was trying to show us how to keep turning the racket.  I said, "Well, I don't see them doing all that out there."  But, then we stopped for some reason and we didn't get back into it.
Speaker 2: Got you.
Speaker 1: But I like tennis a lot.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I like anything where you move a lot, that's why I like basketball.
Story_ID: 420878
Speaker 1: Let's go back to, back to, back to high school for a moment.  When you--there was a report that you went to school with Sam Cooke.  Is that true?
Speaker 2: I might have, but I did not know Sam Cooke.  Of course, Sam Cooke wouldn't have been famous then.  Anyway, he was not in my class that I knew of.
Speaker 1: Were there any other names that became famous later, that you went to high school with?
Speaker 2: Not that I notice.  I look through the book every now and then just to see if there's somebody, but no.  I know that Dinah Washington went to Phillips [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Around the same time?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  But I just know that she went, because I hear her name when they talk about alumni.
Speaker 1: Do you ever go back to the school sometimes, have you ever been back?  Do you ever want to go back?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head) (Laughter).
Speaker 1: See how they receive you back there.  You're probably one of their most honored, well-known alumni.
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I might be.
Speaker 1: Get in touch with them, and say, "I'd like to come back and visit."  That would be a surprise.
Speaker 2: Well, they invite me every now and then, you know, but I haven't flown back because they don't have the money to send for you, so I got to fly back and stay in a hotel.  Then I walk in, and I don't know anybody, you know, and I doubt if anybody remembers me.
Story_ID: 420879
Speaker 1: In 1950, you then attended Peters Business College [Cortez W. Peters Business College, Chicago, Illinois] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Cortez Peters.
Speaker 1: Cortez Peters?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was that like, business school?  Now, you're making a decision here now.
Speaker 2: Well, it was taking shorthand and typing, and in the middle of that before I graduated, I got a job--no, that was real estate--then I got a job as a receptionist at Service Bindery Corporation [ph.] in Chicago [Illinois] on Wabash [Avenue], and I worked there for six years.  So, I was doing what I was going to school for, so they put me in the office--when I was there a little over a year, they put me in the office, and I started doing receptionist and typing and the shorthand.  You know, if they wanted to dictate, "Marla [HistoryMaker Marla Gibbs]," Mrs. Colbert [ph.], would call and say "Marla, take a letter to Mr. So and So, and tell him, thank him for the so and so."  So, I had to make up the letter, so I didn't need the shorthand, so there was no reason to stay in it.  In those days, they didn't hiring Negroes for a lot of that type of work anyway.  So, I was fortunate that I got in there.  And we did so well that--I got my girlfriend in--that people would call us and ask us if we knew anybody else like us, so I thought that was an honor, to be looking around for people to go into these offices.  They said, "We're thinking about taking a black girl in."  They didn't say black then.  A colored girl then.  So, I guess I got a lot of people working.
Speaker 1: Then, as time went on in the '60s [1960s], after you'd done--you'd had a variety of jobs as I understand.  You were a receptionist, an addressograph operator, a switchboard operator--you had a variety of jobs.
Speaker 2: The addressograph operator was in Detroit [Michigan], and that was for a temporary agency, I can't remember the name, but it was a famous one.  And, being colored, they put me running the addressograph machine. I was pregnant at the time, so that was interesting.  And then I worked at the Gotham Hotel [Detroit, Michigan] as a receptionist.  Gotham was a black-owned hotel.  Mr. White [John White] and his wife, and his brother--wait a minute, Mr. White, what's Mr. White's first name?  Anyway, he ran the Gotham Hotel, and the Gotham Hotel had a fabulous dining room.  People would come there and have brunch, and they had some--so my brunch was patterned after his brunch. And they had black entrepreneurs, you know, they had the gift shop and the jewelry shop, and of course, the restaurant.  And then there was the lobby in which the millionaires sat, the black millionaires, and they all had their pictures up on the wall.
Speaker 1: A black millionaire, wow.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Were there a lot of black millionaires around that time?
Speaker 2: In Detroit, there was, thanks to the numbers, running the numbers operations, you know.
Speaker 1: There was another guy in Detroit, maybe around the same time that you were there.  His name is [HistoryMaker] Berry Gordy. Did you know that gentleman back then?
Speaker 2: I didn't know Berry Gordy.  I lived about three blocks from where The Supremes grew up.  I was on this side of Davison [Davison Freeway], and they were on the other side.  That was after I got married [to Jordan Gibbs, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Detroit was the town, Motown [Motown Records].
Speaker 2: It really was.
Speaker 1: It was the town.  There was so much going on around that time.
Speaker 2: I didn't think about singing--and of course they were doing R&B and I was doing jazz anyway. I didn't think about singing or doing any of those things.  I thought more about being a wife and a mother.  That consumed my time.
Story_ID: 420880
Speaker 1: Then you got a job for United Airlines.
Speaker 2: Yes, I was working for the city, the bus company, the DSR, the Department of Street Railways [Detroit Department of Transportation], in Detroit [Michigan] and I was having marital problems, and so it was making me ill, so I went to--my mother [Ophelia Kemp Cady] sent me out to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] for six months, and I stayed in L.A., and then when I went back, I didn't want to go back to the Department of Street and Railways, so I came out of the bank on Michigan Avenue in Detroit, and I looked across the street and there was American Airlines.  Then by the time I walked down to the next corner, that was United across the street.  Then I kept looking across the street, and I said, "I wonder how they get those jobs."  So, I decided to go across the street, and by the time I got to the end of the block where United was, and I walked in the office and I asked them, "How do you get jobs at the airline?"  So, they said, "The office is down the street, back where American was.  You go in that building."  So, I went in that building and I went to--a lot of the airlines were in that building.  So, I'd go to one, let's say I went to Delta [Delta Air Lines], and I'd fill out an application, and they'd say, "Why did you apply to Delta?  And I'd say "Because I always fly Delta."  Then I went to American (laughter), "Why do you want to work for American?" "Because I always fly American." And when I got to United, "Because I always fly United" (laughter).  And then I filled out the application, and then they brought me in for an interview, and then I had to come back and take a physical exam.  It never occurred to me that I was being hired, you know, because I didn't know at what point--so, I took the exam and my blood pressure was high, so I said oh my goodness. So, I went over to--they said, "Go relax and come back."  So, I went over to the building and sat down, took a catnap, and got up and came back.  It was higher than it was when I left (laughter).  So, I said, oh my God.  So, I called the doctor that I was going to, and they gave me a shot, and then my blood pressure went down low, so I went back and I got the job.  So, I said, well God, that was easy.  So, there was only one girl in there and I couldn't tell whether she was white or black, she was light-skinned and her name was Kwan [ph.].  And--it's coming back to me.  And so, then I started telling everybody how easy it was to get a job at the airlines (laughter), so I guess I got about four or five people hired, especially people that worked at DSR with me, because what we were doing were reservations, so we'd be telling people how to get the plane and times--the same thing we were doing at the bus company, you know, how you catch the bus, where it goes from here to here, and how you get from here to there, all of that.  So, that prepared me for United Airlines.
Story_ID: 420881
Speaker 1: United Airlines prepared me for television, because anytime you're working those kinds of jobs, you connect with people all day long, and of course, you almost get to read their minds.  You know what they want before they ask for it.  You know, some of them might get--some businessmen might get annoyed and say, "Well, let me ask you," (laughter) because you're deciding what he wants, you know.  But, you know what he wants, based on what he said to you.  So, I started working for United, and I was with United eleven years, and I was taking acting, because when I got in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], that's where all the acting was happening, so I started thinking about acting.  So, I got in workshops, and the first one was PASLA, Performing Arts Society of Los Angeles [Los Angeles, California], and Ta-Tanisha had been there, she was on--what was it, was it 'Room 222'?  Anyway, Ta-Tanisha was like a little star. So, I was happy being in that workshop, and we only paid three dollars.  I took my daughter [Angela Elayne Gibbs] with me, we paid three dollars for our clipboard, and we got some of the best training, and Roger Mosley [Roger E. Mosley] was in that class also.  And--
Speaker 2: Roger Mosley?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  And, then we went over to Mafundi Institute [Los Angeles, California], and Watts Writers [Watts Writers Workshop] was across the street.  They had a play going, so we went over and auditioned for that, and got it, 'Native Son' [Richard Wright and Paul Green].  Roger played my son, and my girlfriend, Pat Edwards [Patricia Edwards], was the first black stage manager for Norman Lear, and her son played my son, and my daughter was in it, she played my daughter.  And we got some reviews, so we went back across the street to Mafundi and we did a play called 'Happy Days' ['Happy Days are Here Again'] which was formerly known as 'Black Conflict' [ph.] and we had a Barbra Streisand music opening, 'Happy Days,' and we got great reviews for that.  Roger was my husband in that one, and my daughter was my sister-in-law, so we did two or three plays there, and then Margaret Avery had a workshop at the Zodiac [Zodiac Theater, Los Angeles, California] called--and they were doing a play called, 'Does a Tiger Wear a Necktie?' [Don Petersen]. And, we heard about that, and it was so fantastic. The performances were so fantastic.  Clint Eastwood had heard about, and came down and hired Margaret Avery off the stage.  And, so I joined that workshop and I did three plays there.  And while I was there, they were auditioning for 'The Jeffersons,' and I went out for 'The Jeffersons.'  I was still working at United, so as I got the job, I got seven out of thirteen contracts.  The following year I did three shows.  I was just a guest for the first one.  They liked it, so they wrote something else for me.  So, they wrote three shows for me in the first half season, then they offered me a contract when we got picked up.  So, I didn't see any reason to leave United Airlines because I was doing seven out of thirteen, and we all know how many weeks there are in a year (laughter).  And I had seniority, so I could always pick the hours I wanted, so I always picked the day shift, no I picked the night shift, and I picked Saturday and Sunday.  That way, if somebody who had Monday and Tuesday would always want the weekend, and I could trade and give them my Saturday and Sunday for their Monday and Tuesday, because I needed that Monday and Tuesday.  So it worked out that way.  So, I was never off.  When we were off for five months, I was still working, and then we were off for the weekend, I was working, so I kept that up for two years, and then the producers asked me if I still had that job.  So, I said, "Yeah."  So, they said, "Well, we thought you had quit."  So, I said, "Well, you haven't told me anything to make me quit.  You got something to tell me?"  So, they said, "If we--would you take a leave of absence?"  I said, "If you pay me."  So, they paid me for my leave of absence and I took a ninety-day leave of absence, and then I decided to go on.  Of course, I was never sorry, because the show went on and on and on.  It's still going on (laughter).
Story_ID: 420882
Speaker 1: I just want to go back just a little bit, because when you first came back here to Los Angeles [California], something, some bug bit you that made you want to take those acting lessons.  What was that?
Speaker 2: Well, when I was out here--when I was ill, when I came out to--well, I'm backing up--I was married [to Jordan Gibbs, Sr.] and I got sick, and I got very ill, and my mother [Ophelia Kemp Cady] sent me out here to get well.  So, I came out here and I stayed for six months.  I had an ulcer, and I had to take care of me. I didn't have any kids to take care of.  Before, I was taking care of everybody else, as a lot of mothers do.  You know, you make sure everybody else has food, and you may eat last.  So, I came out here and I got well.  All I had to do--I got a job at Bank of America, and all I had to do was go to work and come home and fix my meals, and take care of myself.  And while I was here, my sister who we always thought was a big star, because she did background work, and we'd see her on TV and whenever she would come to Detroit [Michigan], they would meet her at the plane, a starlet, Frieda Rentie arrives (laughter), you know.  And so when I got out here, I talked to her agent--she's the one who sent me over to PASLA [Performing Arts Society of Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], told me to go take some lessons, so and then she was my first agent.  So, when I got the first movie, which was 'Sweet Jesus, Preacherman,' with Roger [Roger E. Mosley], my friend Della [HistoryMaker Della Reese-Lett] and I used to go around and find out where the producers were and who was shooting something, and we'd go in and introduce ourselves, so we did that.  It was across the street from the DMV [California Department of Motor Vehicles], so we went in and they were first time producers and directors and stuff, so I went in, and they were impressed, so they came to our workshop and they hired Roger to be in the movie, and they hired Della and then we had a couple of boys, and they hired them.  My daughter [Angela Elayne Gibbs] was gone at that time--I don't know where she was, she had gone at that time, so she didn't get in.  But, wow, we were at the workshop, at Mafundi [Mafundi Institute, Los Angeles, California].  'Cleopatra Jones' was filming, and we were trying to get on to 'Cleopatra Jones.'  But he--I'm trying to think of the guy's name [Max Julien] who did it--he wrote it.
Speaker 1: Oh, I can't think of who it is (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm looking at his face, and I can't think of his name.
Speaker 1: I know who played Cleopatra Jones.  That was--
Speaker 2: He wanted Vonetta McGee, because she was going with him, but she didn't get it.
Speaker 1: Okay, we'll come back to that.
Speaker 2: Anyway, he hired my daughter off the stage because she was doing a scene, and she was [HistoryMaker] Angela Davis, and he never forgot her.  He was trying to find her, and she was saying "I don't think acting is relevant (laughter)."
Speaker 1: Not relevant, huh?
Speaker 2: Yes, so she ended up getting the part, and we were still doing the little independent films.
Story_ID: 420883
Speaker 1: But you had a love of black theater at that time in your life.  You took lessons and you were doing black theater.
Speaker 2: My daughter [Angela Elayne Gibbs] is the one who started the black theater.  People give me the credit because they just assume that it was me, but it was my daughter.  In 1981, I wanted to buy the club, because I was into jazz, and I wanted to buy the club for the jazz music.  And I had bought a theater [Crossroads Theater] over on Vermont [Avenue, Los Angeles, California] and I wanted to sell coffee and dessert, and jazz.  But we found out--we had--on the path to the planes we had all the noise.  So, at that time Larry Hearn had Marla's Memory Lane [sic. Memory Lane; Marla's Memory Lane Supper Club, Los Angeles, California], and I came over to hear O.C. Smith as a matter of fact.  And it's so funny because a psychic friend of mine, Arlee [ph.], we wanted to go out together, and we went to go see 'Bustin' Loose,' the movie, and we couldn't find it anywhere.   And we were coming down Hollywood Boulevard, because she lived south of Hollywood, coming down Sunset [Boulevard]--she lived north of Sunset, and you know how the traffic is on the weekend, you just have to--because everybody's cruising over there, and it kept taking us this way, and we couldn't find any movies, and we ended up at Van Ness [Avenue]--Wilton [Place], I mean, Wilton.  So, we got off, just getting out of the traffic.  So, I said, "Let's go down to Memory Lane," which I had called her to go to in the first place, and she had said let's go to a movie, so to show you how God works, we end up on Wilton.  And I said, "Well, let's go on to the Memory Lane."  She said, "Well, I'm hungry."  So I said "Let's see if they still got something to eat," well, it's almost ten o'clock.  So we get down to Memory Lane, and we're sitting there and we asked the waiter, "Is the kitchen open?"  So, he said, "I think they're closing, but they're just closing."  So we went back in the kitchen and we saw the cook and she came out, and she said, "I'm a fan of your work."  We said, "Can we get--?" She said, "Well I can fix you two chicken dinners."  We said, "Thank you."  She fixed us two chicken dinners and while I was sitting there eating the chicken dinner, Larry Hearn walked in.  And he came in the back door because he lived next door, and he came in through the kitchen a lot of times, and he looked in the dining room and saw us, and came in and said, "How you doing?"  So, I said, "Fine."  He said, "What are you doing?"  I didn't want to tell him I was opening the club because, you know, it wasn't anything like his club.  So we talked for a few minutes, and then he asked me again, "So, what are you doing?"  So, I said, "Well, as a matter of fact, I'm trying to open a jazz club."  So, he said, "Why don't you buy this one?"  I said, "Oh, Larry, you're not going to sell this club."  He said, "I'm moving to Hawaii," he said, "and I want to sell the club, but everybody wants to give you a dollar and a promise."  He said, "I want somebody who's going to pay for it."  So, we made a deal, and I decided to buy the club.  So, I brought the architect over there, and he said, "This makes more sense."  So, we started getting ready to buy the club.
Story_ID: 420884
Speaker 1: You never know, there might be a Vision 2 [Vision Theatre, Los Angeles, California], you never know what God (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was somebody--you have a thought, you put it out there, somebody picks--once you speak it, somebody picks it up.
Speaker 1: Yes ma'am.
Speaker 2: We're all using the same mind.  Somebody picks it up, and they move forward, so if it's not there, somebody will do it somewhere.
Speaker 1: Somewhere. If we can continue, you mentioned that you had met Larry [Larry Hearn] and he was telling you about Marla's Memory Lane [sic. Memory Lane; Marla's Memory Lane Supper Club, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 2: Yeah, he said "Why don't you buy it?" And once I realized he was serious, we worked it out, and we started with me buying the house next door where he was staying, and that was like the down payment, so I bought that for fifty thousand dollars.  Somebody was trying to get six hundred fifty thousand dollars for it. I said, "Are they kidding?" (Laughter) And then we went on, we got an escrow, and I ended up buying the club.
Speaker 1: It was called Marla's Memory Lane? Oh when you bought it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was called the Memory Lane, and I just made it Marla's Memory Lane, to keep it Memory Lane, because it was like a classic.  It was the oldest jazz club in Southern California, and had quite a history because of all the people who had performed there.
Speaker 1: And the food was great?
Speaker 2: Yes, and I kept the food tradition, and I took it even further, you know, the food.
Speaker 1: In what way?
Speaker 2: Well, I think it was just a steak house, or a prime rib--and back and forth--they didn't keep consistent chefs back then, towards the end, you know.  I guess mainly because Larry and his wife had moved to Hawaii, and she wanted to live in Hawaii, and he was going back and forth. So, his dedication was not there.  It was kind of going down, and I think he had his nephew or somebody watching it, and he had dogs and Dobermans guarding it, and they were crapping everywhere.  You walk in, and that's what you smelled, you thought you were smelling the bathroom.
Speaker 1: Now, you purchased Marla's Memory Lane in what year?
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty-one [1981].
Speaker 1: Nineteen eighty-one [1981].
Story_ID: 420885
Speaker 1: And at the same time my daughter said, "We want to open Crossroads [Crossroads Arts Academy and Theater, Los Angeles, California]," and we named that after Horace Tapscott's recording of 'At the Crossroads.'  So, we named it Crossroads Arts Academy, and she said, "Well, Shea [ph.] and I can do it."  So, I said, "Okay."  Well, Shea had--they had gone to school together at Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  And so I said, "Well okay," so she started Crossroads.  And she had a lot of teaching, and she put all the plays there, and as a matter of fact, she produced '227' [Christine Houston] there, and hired me to be in it, and that's how that got started.  She did 'Checkmates' [Ron Milner], and that went to Broadway.  So my daughter is phenomenal, and we opened the Vision [Vision Theatre, Los Angeles, California]--she ran the arts academy inside the Vision.  We had Crossroads as a non-profit in the Vision, and she ran all the classes.  As a matter of fact, she opened the summer programs.  We had Marla's camp, which was her idea.  And people would drop off their kid in the morning at seven o'clock, and they would not pick them back up, and at the end of the day, she ended up having to take them home, and sitting there waiting for people to pick up their kids, you know.  And they would send children who had problems, you know, really needed some help.  One little girl was hurting herself, and at first the kids were saying, "Oh, don't do that," and then they would say, "We don't care, go kill yourself." (Laughter) So, the little girl was afraid to come out and perform, so Angela [Gibbs' daughter, Angela Elayne Gibbs] had to get--she had to teach her to perform, then on opening night, she wouldn't come out, she was under the sofa, she wouldn't come out.  So, Angela got up under the sofa with her, you know (laughter).  So, she went through a hell of a whole lot, but the kids loved her, she was a good teacher.

Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right. Right.
Speaker 1: --this character, Florence [Florence Johnston], this crazy lady who was just--
Speaker 2: Who reminded me of my aunt and my grandmother, and so that's how I delivered them, and frequently lines would come up that they would say, I would throw in there, and they would keep them.  Like, ain't that a blip, because they didn't cuss in them days, you know, they didn't say ain't that a bitch, they said ain't that a blip.  And Roxie [Roxie Roker] said to me, "Florence, money isn't everything," and I looked at her and said, "Well, ain't that a blip."  And they wanted to use it all the time, and I said, "No, it only goes in certain places at certain times."  And, there were a lot of little things that came up.  They were very liberal with us.  Nicholl, Ross [Michael Ross] and West [Bernie West] were the producers, and Don Nicholl was like the head writer of the group, so he would pay attention to me, because when I first went, I sat at the table and we did the table read, and then we'd go sit down and they would go off and do their notes and come back, and give us notes.  So, when the cast got up from the table, I'd stay at the table, because I wanted to know what they were going to say, because I didn't know the cast anyway, you know, I'd just met them.  So, I was interested in what they were doing at the table, so I stayed there.  And I guess the cast was looking at me like, "What's she doing here," and then I started interrupting, "Excuse me, excuse me."  And they'd look around, and they didn't want to tell me to leave, you know, they were trying to be polite.  And I said, "Black people don't talk like that."  And they said, "What do you mean?"  So, it was coming to me as I spoke and I said, "Well, everybody has their rhythm." I said, "Chinese people speak a certain way."  I said, "Jewish people, you punch things a lot."  I said, "Black people just--they just say the whole line, and throw it away, they don't stop and punch all that."  My grandmother said, "If you don't get up, I'm going to knock--."  They'd say the whole thing, and everybody understands that rhythm, no matter what race they are, if they've heard black people talk.  And they hear it, and it sounds familiar to them.  That's somebody they've heard or know.  And that's her rhythm--I'd say a lot of times, "That's got to be a joke."  We know it don't fit your rhythm (laughter).  But I would break mine up. I'd either take Mr. Jefferson [George Jefferson] out and put it at the front, or at the back, however the sentence would flow.  And I just said God was working with me, that's all I can say.  And it worked, I would get my laugh all the time, that's all they were concerned about.
Speaker 1: There was something so unique about Florence.  It was your personality, it was your acting ability.  You made her a household name.
Speaker 2: Well, I believed in her, and everybody knew her. It was like I was saying about the rhythm--everybody knew Florence.  With most white people, they had either hired her, or they met her at the grocery store, wherever.  They knew her.  Of course, all the black people knew her--she was in church, she had took over everybody's--she'd take over your children whether you liked it or not, she'd tell you, give you her opinion whether you asked for it or not (laughter), and so I knew her, so that's what she was patterned after.
Speaker 1: And they gave you the freedom to write some lines and do some other (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well they gave me, not to write them, but they gave me the freedom to say this, you know, this is what I would say, and we would try it--they'd say well try it, and we tried it, and they liked it, and we'd keep it.  Also, Sherman [Sherman Hemsley] did that a lot, too.
Story_ID: 420887
Speaker 1: Talk about Sherman [Sherman Hemsley], please.  He was Mr. Jefferson [George Jefferson].
Speaker 2: He was Mr. Jefferson, and he was the most generous performer, because I can't hit you if you don't set me up, and he set me up just right each time, so that I could hit him, you know (laughter).  So we had a unique relationship.  He'd come in sometimes, and he'd say, "Marla [HistoryMaker Marla Gibbs], I don't remember the lines," and I'd say, "Yes, you do."  I said, "Your mind took a picture of them when we said them the first day.  You keep saying, 'I don't know my lines,' and that's why they're not coming out."  I said, "All you have to do is just listen, they'll come."  He'd come back and he'd say, "You know, I know that (laughter).  I knew that."  But, he didn't think about it that way.  But I was always--being a Gemini, I was always analytical. And, I said, "You just say something, and when your lips start moving, I'll start talking."  And so, we would laugh, and that's what we would do.  I just saw the show again the other day, where they were having an argument and I was standing there chewing gum and just looking at them.  And he finally turns around and looks at me, and I know he's forgotten his lines.  His line is, "What you looking at?"  But he's looking at me, and it wasn't coming to him, and I just kept on chewing my gum and looking at him, and the audience kept cracking up over and over.  So, they just held and held, and finally he said, "Well, what you looking at?"  And I said, "I was just thinking.  You know, I ought to bring my neighbor's kids over here, because this place is better than a zoo." (Laughter) So, that just happened on the floor.  Well, you always know when the actor goofs up on his lines, you know.  So, something just made me--instead of trying to save him, just keep chewing the gum and looking at him, and it worked.  So, and little things like--he came up with the idea to choke me.  We had the big piano in there, and the director said, "You know, I wish somebody could go up under this piano."  The piano was big enough so, there was no room for anything else in the apartment.  And they had a party, and Mr. Jefferson was trying to impress Mr. Whittendale.  So, he thought Mr. Whittendale was coming down.  So, he went to get the door for him, and of course I wanted to get the door, because that's my job.  So, he's coming from the kitchen, and I'm trying to get around the other way, and he said, "I'll get it."  And I'm saying, "I'll get it." "I'll get it." "I'll get it."  And, I said, "I can go under the piano."  And he said, "Well, how do you do it?"  So, I said, "Watch."  So, we ran it, and I went under, pushing the tray all the way under it, and when I came out, I throw the tray to Mrs. Jefferson [Louise Jefferson] so I could go to get the door.  She said, "And when--." Mrs. Jefferson, Isabel [Isabel Sanford], loved slapstick.   She said, "When you get--just push it in to me, so that I fall back."  So, I pushed it to her, "Here, Mrs. Jefferson," and I'm running, I was about to get the door, and Mr. Jefferson gets frustrated, and he turns around and he chokes me.  I say, "I'll get it, Mr. Jefferson," and he chokes me, and it's so funny.  The director says, "That's funny, but they're not going to stop laughing."  Audiences are so smart.  I said, "Let him throw me in the bathroom."  So, he threw me in the bathroom, and the moment that door closed--the audience was ready for whoever comes in the door, you know, so that worked and so we used that a lot for the promotion.
Story_ID: 420888
Speaker 1: And then there was Weezie [Louise Jefferson].
Speaker 2: And then there was Weezie.  Weezie was the star of the show.  Everybody thought it was Mr. Jefferson [George Jefferson], but it was Isabel's [Isabel Sanford] show, and everybody thought Mr. Jefferson didn't want the maid, but Mr. Jefferson was the one who wanted the maid because the Willis' had a maid.  Mrs. Jefferson was the one who didn't want a maid.  But, everything she'd say--she said, "There's a lot of windows, and they've got to be washed once a month."  So, I said, "Once a month?"  She said, "See, George, she doesn't do windows."  And I said, "Not no once a month, I'll wash your windows every week."  And he said, "She got the job."  So, they kept going back and forth, and that's how I got the job. I liked a lot of fast moving.  Isabel liked a lot of slapstick.  Isabel is really a comedian, and she would have been Florence [Florence Johnston] in somebody else's house, but since she was the wife and I was the maid, she didn't get a chance to do all the comedy that she would have liked, you know.  So, people gave George and I a lot of credit, but, you know you cannot do the comedy if somebody doesn't, somebody's got to be the straight man, so that's what I became on '227,' and that's what she was on 'The Jeffersons.'
Speaker 1: Roxie [Roxie Roker].
Speaker 2: Roxie?  Roxie was my girl.  She was such a class act, and such a good friend.  So, I attended a lot of things at her house, you know.  And Lenny [Lenny Kravitz], of course, Lenny was growing up.  Lenny's a Gemini like I, so she would say, "You understand him."  But my son always knew that Lenny would be great.  He said, "Lenny's going to be great," and he was right.
Speaker 1: They were breaking open scenarios that American public was not even used to--an interracial couple.
Speaker 2: No and the thing was, they were an interracial couple.  Franklin [Franklin Cover] was married to a Spanish woman [Mary Bradford Stone].  Roxie was married to a Jewish man [Sy Kravitz] in real life, and that's more of why they got the job, because they were already in one, and there was nothing to overcome.  And Roxie used to call Franklin the black woman's burden (laughter).  She had to pick him up and take him home all the time because he wasn't driving, he didn't have a car in the city.  So, she ended up taking him home and picking him up, and she called him the black woman's burden, and her and his wife would tease every time they would get together, and they got together a lot.
Speaker 1: And then Bentley [Harry Bentley] came along, crazy Bentley.
Speaker 2: Bentley [sic. Paul Benedict], became, of course, a director now.  My daughter [Angela Elayne Gibbs] has done a short film called 'Ties that Bind' ['The Ties that Bind'] that I'm also co-starring in, and we're invited to the Martha Vineyard's Film Festival [sic. Martha's Vineyard Film Festival], so last time I talked to Bentley, he was--Paul Benedict--who was Bentley, he was doing a play at Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts].  So, I'm going to call him when I get there.  When I went to do 'Vagina Monologues' ['The Vagina Monologues,' Eve Ensler], I looked for him and looked for him, and couldn't find him, he had moved from where I thought he was.  And I kept asking people in the area, and then one time one of the men in the restaurant said, "I saw him and I told him that you were looking for him."  But we never got together.
Speaker 1: And Lionel [Lionel Jefferson].
Speaker 2: Lionel [sic. Damon Evans] stays in touch.  He's in New York [New York].  See, Lionel was always a straight actor, and comedy was foreign to him, and all they told him was don't do what Mike Evans did, and that was not helping him at all.  So, he was frustrated a lot, but he was good.  And, he sent me a tape from London [England].  He was doing 'Porgy and Bess' [George Gershwin]. So Lionel, I stay in touch with him, when we're doing something, I call Lionel and let him know.
Speaker 1: Who's still living, from the original cast?
Speaker 2: We just lost Franklin.  So, I would go back and forth to see Franklin and, you know, he had a heart transplant, so when he was well enough I invited him to a brunch and I invited the cast.  Ned Wertimer, doorman [Ralph Hart] and his wife [Skyne Uku-Wertimer], and Berlinda [Berlinda Tolbert] and Adella [Adella Farmar], who was our wardrobe person.  We all had a brunch up at the Bel-Air Hotel [Hotel Bel-Air, Los Angeles, California], and Franklin was so happy when he came in.  So, I was so sorry to lose Franklin.  Franklin was so funny.  I did get a chance to have him on '227,' though.  He came on as the butler.
Story_ID: 420889
Speaker 1: And George [George Jefferson], what's he doing?
Speaker 2: George is still (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sherman Hemsley--
Speaker 2: --he's looking for work. I talked to him.  We just both did something for Medicare.  It's going to be a radio promotion for Medicare.  So, I taped mine here and he taped his in Texas, and so they'll put them together.
Speaker 1: Can you please tell us about that crazy walk that he used to have?
Speaker 2: He still does that, but that's not how he walks for real, you know.  But that's how he walked in Gitlow.  That's where Norman Lear picked him up from.  Of course, I've never seen Gitlow--'Purlie' [Peter Udell], you know.  It just works because he's such an extrovert on camera, and such an introvert off camera.  He was so shy.  We'd go to do something at a hotel where they have different actors sit at different tables with different people who have paid money, producers and things.  And wherever the table where Sherman was, they'd say, "We felt so sorry for him." (Laughter) They would be, "Just take care of him."  So, we would sandwich him, Roxie [Roxie Roker] and I--she'd get on one side and I would get on the other, and if they asked a question, we would try to answer it for him, because he was shy.  Now, he's learned, because his manager had a stroke, and so Sherman's had to go places by himself, but he never went by himself, you know.  And he has nobody to take care of him, so he takes care of himself now.  And I went to speak up for him, and he started going, and I said, "Ooh" (laughter).  So, he's doing well.
Speaker 1: Amen.
Speaker 2: We stay in touch by phone.
Speaker 1: And Isabel [Isabel Sanford], how's she doing?
Speaker 2: Isabel passed.
Speaker 1: That's right, she did.  Yes she did (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. And Sherman came, and he was so broken up by it, because they worked together afterwards, they did a lot of commercials and interviews and things, and he just fell apart, and we all had to kind of take care of him.
Speaker 1: Did you ever--okay simultaneously while you guys were doing that show, there was another show ['In the Heat of the Night']--Archie Bunker [sic. Carroll O'Connor] was doing something around that time.
Speaker 2: Well, that was just before, I guess the end of Archie Bunker.  Because they spun off of Archie Bunker. I did his show, his new show--what was the name of the show?  He was in Atlanta [Georgia], out in Georgia, I mean, you know.  And my daughter [Angela Elayne Gibbs] did the show, and I did the show. Her husband was his D.P. [director of photography].  I did one called "A Baby Named Rocket" [sic. "A Baby Called Rocket"].
Story_ID: 420890
Speaker 1: How do you assess the phenomenal impact that that show ['All in the Family'] and 'The Jeffersons' did on American society?
Speaker 2: It started people having dialogue and really questioning their attitudes about race, because Archie Bunker was a racist, and it made him look ridiculous. Sherman [Sherman Hemsley] played the racist--George Jefferson was a racist, and it made him look ridiculous.  So, it gave you both sides, that black people as well as white people have prejudices.  And so it explored both of those things, and I think it set the public to thinking that they might agree with what one or the other was saying, but then the other one would turn out to be a fool at the end, and they had to question themselves, you know.  Of course, they always took a little further, over the top.  It was just like when Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] ran for the presidency, there was a white racist who decided he wanted to vote for him.  It made him--they had publicized that, how he had changed his mind.  And things have happened, for example, the guy that killed Medgar Evers, the one that had to do with the Birmingham [Alabama], little girls in Birmingham--had been brought to justice, and that has changed the way society felt about certain things, about people doing certain things.  'Cause you might say they were terrorists, really.
Speaker 1: Now, 'The Jeffersons,' you guys lasted for ten years?
Speaker 2: Ten and a half, we did eleven seasons.
Speaker 1: Two fifty-three episodes--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and you're in reruns all over the place.
Speaker 2: All over the world.  I still look at it.  It comes on about one o'clock in the morning on TV One, I mean on Nick at Nite.
Speaker 1: Yes. When you see a scene, do you say to yourself, "Gee, I wish I'd done a little bit different here. I could've--."
Speaker 2: Always, always listening to inflections, "I should have done this line."  But most of all, I just enjoy watching everybody now.
Speaker 1: I know they take that show, and then it's cut up, dissected, the sociologists look at it, students look at it--
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: Oh yes.  They want to--'cause like you say, we were going through a traumatic race problem in our country at that time--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and you guys made fun of the race problem.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, you let those people know that the problem you think is a problem is not really as big as you think it is.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know.  We had one where Sherman [sic. George Jefferson] goes out, he has this meeting downstairs, and it's a Ku Klux Klan [KKK] meeting.  He goes in because he thinks it's a business meeting, and he goes in, and they want to know what he's doing there.  Anyway, the guy who's running the meeting is a big racist, and he ends up having a heart attack, and Sherman has to save him with mouth to mouth resuscitation.  And the man, his son says, "But, Dad," because he was training the son to be a racist, he said, "He saved your life."  He said, "He should have let me die."  Everybody said, "Ooh."  So, that was a big show for us.
Story_ID: 420891
Speaker 1: I'm reading here the numbers.  During its eighth season, 'The Jeffersons' was the number three show on network television, behind only 'Dallas' and '60 Minutes.'  That's impressive, when all of America, particularly white America, is looking at you.
Speaker 2: Right, well we had something for everyone.  You know, you have people who work for tips whether they're white or black--all the doormen in New York [New York] and other places, and all the people in the restaurant business, who work for tips.  Ah, Ned Wertimer--Ralph [Ralph Hart] was one--the doorman, is the one who represented them.  I represented all the people who just were regular people who working on a job and who had a boss, and who felt like they couldn't say what they wanted to say without losing their job.  I said it for them, so they got their boss through me, or their oppressive father or their oppressive husband, whoever it was, they got them through me.  And then you had Isabel [Isabel Sanford], who represented all the people who were wives that volunteered, you know, all the people of society that you didn't know.  And then you had Franklin [Franklin Cover] who was in the publishing business, and he was a successful book publisher.  You had Roxie [Roxie Roker] in an interracial marriage, and you had--so you got a chance to peep at what a marriage was like.  And they had children, and then Sherman [Sherman Hemsley] was making fun of them all the time, calling them zebras and half zebras (laughter).   And then you had the problems of--they had a son [Allan Willis], also, who was away, he comes home and he has a problem because the daughter was upset that he seemed to be able to go places that she couldn't go and do things that she couldn't do.  And he went to Europe, because it was easy, nobody cared who he was over there. And so, the family thought maybe he left because he was embarrassed by them, and he was saying--she said, "Well, you went away."  And he said, "I would have stayed if you asked me to stay, you never asked me to stay."  She said, "We don't want to be oppressive parents."  And he said, "Don't knock it 'til you tried it."  And Berlinda [sic. Jenny Willis Jefferson] had been mad at him, and he didn't know why.  He's trying to come to see his sister, and finally he said, "I had to go to Europe to find out who I was, I didn't know who I was, so I came home to find out."  And she said, "Well, I know who you are, you're my brother."  And, that was very sweet.
Story_ID: 420892
Speaker 1: Out of 253 episodes [of 'The Jeffersons'], what were some of your more memorable episodes?  I can't really ask you to say which one, because it's kind of hard, but--
Speaker 2: Well, there was Billy Dee [Billy Dee Williams], which became a classic, and of course, Billy Dee, my daughter [Angela Elayne Gibbs] had a crush on him before, and then I had a crush on him after he did the show, because we would stand in the hallway at the end of each show, and people would come backstage and walk by, and we'd sign autographs.  And Billy stood in the doorway and signed autographs and talked to people.  And then, we had real honest conversations.  He was so down to earth.  And, so we had a running joke, Billy Dee, Florence [Florence Johnston] and Billy Dee, you know (laughter).  So, when I was sick in the hospital, as a matter of fact, I was joking with my daughter and I said, you know I was half out--but she said, "Mama, is there anybody that you want to see?"  I said, "Billy Dee." (Laughter) And she tried to find him, and he heard I was sick, but by the time he called the hospital, I was gone. So, I ran into him, and he said, "I tried to call, but you were gone from the hospital."  I said, "Oh, I told--my daughter told me."  I said, "Of course, I was just playing with her, I was keeping the Billy Dee thing going."  But for a long time after the show, every time I'd go out and speak, they'd want to know about Billy Dee, so I'd say something about Billy Dee and make them all laugh, so that became a running gag.  And then we did a movie, 'The Visit,' and I played his wife in 'The Visit.' Of course, we didn't have any love scenes (laughter) but we got to be very close.
Story_ID: 419810
Speaker 1: I wanted to do a CD ['It's Never Too Late'], so--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Speed, roll five.
Speaker 1: --so I did it last year, and I said--I know there's a lot of people who would say, "Isn't it a little late?" And I said, "It's never too late."  So, I said, "That's a good name for the CD."  And then I wrote a song, "It's Never Too Late."
Speaker 2: Never too late.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: 'The Jeffersons' made history.  Isabel [Isabel Sanford] became the first African American woman to receive an Emmy Award.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You became the second.
Speaker 1: No.  Jackee [HistoryMaker Jackee Harry] became the second.  I was nominated four times.
Speaker 2: You never won an Emmy?
Speaker 1: I've never won an Emmy.  Still to come.  Emmy and Oscar [Academy Award] still to come, so I'm hanging around so I can get my Emmy and get my Oscar and get my Grammy [Grammy Award].
Speaker 2: You've never won an Emmy.
Speaker 1: Never won an Emmy.
Speaker 2: I, as a reporter, I have a problem sometimes with the Emmy Awards, back in those days, and even now, because I feel it doesn't reflect the real true scene of talented African Americans on television.  How do you feel about that?
Speaker 1: Well, as I said, things are what they are, it is what it is, so we accept that, because you can't change that, and it doesn't really matter, it's the work.  The work is its own reward, so I always felt like if I get to do the work, that's fine.  You can't legislate who should get an award, you know.  That's not in your control.  You can do the performance the way you want to do the performance sometimes.  So, what you want to do is, do the kind of work that you want to do, and if you do that, perhaps you will get an award.  I don't know, but the award is not important.
Speaker 2: But even sometimes people even politic, and do all kinds of things to get that award.
Speaker 1: But you can't pay any attention to that, because there's nothing you can do about that.  You can spend your time trying to deal with that, or spend your time doing what it is you want to do, you know.  But then, we're making judgments, and God tells us not to judge unless we want to be judged.  So, we don't know what the real reason is behind those things, but if they're not doing what is correct, that's on them.  You have to keep your eyes focused on the goal, you know.  So, most people talk about what they don't want.  I said it's just as important to know what you do want, as it is to know what you don't, and you should be working on what you do want.
Speaker 2: Amen. Amen.
Speaker 1: What is that poem ['If,' Rudyard Kipling], you're a man, my son.  If you can hold while everything around you is going, you know.  Then, you're a man, my son.  Do you remember that?
Speaker 2: Vaguely, very vaguely.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but, those lines are very true.  You have to keep your faith when everybody--keep your head when everybody around you seems to be losing theirs, you know.  So, you can't worry about what other people are doing.  You really have to stay on your journey.
Story_ID: 419811
Speaker 1: When you played Florence Johnston, the black community was just alive with that show--the white community and all communities were alive, but the black community was alive.  How were you received by the black community when you played that role?
Speaker 2: With a lot of love, with a lot of love from everybody, really, but in the black community in particular.  People were, youngsters were--I was concerned that they would think it was a stereotype, but youngsters were trying to find somebody in their family who had been a maid, or was a maid.  "Well, you know, my mama was a maid, or I had an aunt who was a maid."  They wanted to identify, you know, and I was very happy about that, that they saw her as someone close to them.  And today, they still do it.  There was a white girl coming down to the office.  I was coming out of, what do you call it, a commercial interview.  And before I could get to the car, she was coming up to me, and she just said, "I just love you, I just love your work."  People come up to me with love all the time, and that's been the most rewarding thing.  I was in a Korean bathhouse, and the girl that was working for me came.  She said, "I'm going to take you over there."  So, you know, they scrub you down, then they massage you.  So, we were in there, and nobody spoke English.  And I was sitting in the front waiting for them to come back, and these ladies started pointing at me, and coming up, and I said, "What are they doing?"  Then one of them said, "Jefferson," and I got so tickled.  You'd be surprised.  And I said, how do they know?
Speaker 1: If I may give you a compliment, you say the love they give you--but every time I see you, every time I've always seen you, there's always love coming back from you to other people.  And we thank you (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, that's what we are.  We know we are loved, and like, I like to hug people, primarily because the young man, Horace Tapscott, always felt like touching was important, and that came to me.  So, people always say to me, "I want a hug, can I have a hug?"  And I'd say, "Yes."  A lot of people want an autograph, but a lot of people want a hug.  We went to the island of Sardinia [Italy], (pronunciation) Sardania they call it, we call it (pronunciation) Sardinia.  And when we arrived at the airport, I'm walking in the airport and these people start rushing towards me, and I said, "Oh, there's something that I don't know, because I'm in a strange country."  I mean, here's all these people running at me, and they got close and they started saying, "Florence, Florence," and the show was running then, in Italian.  And I got a chance to see it, and the dubbing was so flawless, I couldn't realize what I was really saying there, in English.  But, it was so good, and it was a big hit over there.
Speaker 1: Well, that was an experience a lot of us will never ever forget, 'The Jeffersons.'  As they said, "We're moving on up to the East Side," (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Moving on up.
Story_ID: 419812
Speaker 1: Then after that show ['The Jeffersons'] went away, another show came for you that we had a chance to digest your talent.
Speaker 2: '227.'
Speaker 1: '227.' Talk about that show for us, please, ma'am (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) As I said before, '227' [Christine Houston] was a play that we did at Crossroads [Crossroads Arts Academy and Theater, Los Angeles, California], and Hal Williams was my husband in the play, and Regina King was a little girl down the street who got on, who plucked my nerves all the time, with her little fast self.  And another young lady named Sonya Winston [ph.] was my daughter.  Well, Angela [Angela Elayne Gibbs] said, "Why don't you get the rights to it?"  And, I hadn't even thought about it.  So, finally, I asked Christine Houston for the rights, and she said, "Roy Campanella [Roy Campanella, II] asked me for the rights, too."  So, I said, "Oh," and she said, "But I want to give them to you, so maybe you all can share them."  So, I said, "I don't care."  So, that's what happened.  So, I started.  Scoey Mitchell came with the head of NBC, Brandon Tartikoff.  And then, of course, I didn't know who Brandon was.  He brought him to the play, and he stayed after to meet me, and I'm rushing, and he came over and said, "Hi Scoey, how are you?"  He said, "This is Brandon Tartikoff."  I said, "Oh hi, how are you?" And I left, and Scoey said what's wrong with her?  And then Columbia [Columbia Pictures Television] came, everybody came to see--Universal [Universal Television] and who was it, was it Roy?  I think Roy had a deal with Universal, so he got them to start talking about doing the show.  But they didn't want Christine Houston to have anything to do with the show.  She was a writer, and I didn't like that, I didn't like what they were saying.  And then, for executive producer, the executive producer they brought on the set, he works alone.  So, I got outside, I said, "Well, if he works alone, that's what he can do, work alone, because I'm not interested in doing it with them."  So, in the meantime, Norman Lear sees me on the lot, and he says, "Marla [HistoryMaker Marla Gibbs], I hear you got a good play over there."  I said, "Yes."  He said, "Well, I want to see it."  I said, "Well, you better come tomorrow, because we're closing tomorrow."  So, he said, "Well, call my office."  So sure enough, he and his wife came and we were so crowded, they had to sit in the very back.  And at the end of the play, he said, "Marla, what are you doing with it?"  I said, "Well, I'm talking to Universal, but they haven't got around yet."  He said, "Have you signed anything?" I said, "No, they haven't gotten around to talking about any money yet."  So, he said, "Well why don't you and I do it?"  I said, "Well okay, that's on."  So, that shows you how God works, and I told him that NBC had been there, and he said, "Well, we have to offer it to CBS first."  He said, "Would you put the play back up?"  I said, "If you pay for it."  So, he said, "Okay" so they paid for it and we put the play back up.  In the meantime, I had brought Susie in, Susie Garrett, and Susie was stealing the show.  So, I remember Virginia [sic. Claire Lear Brown], one of Norman's sisters came and she said, "Marla, she's stealing the play."  So, I said, "That's okay because I have a contract."  So, Brandon Tartikoff picked Susie off the stage to star in 'Punky Brewster,' so I kept saying, "I want her for '227.'"  He said, "No, I'm sorry, I'm keeping her for 'Punky Brewster.'" He said, "But we got you."  So, I said, "Okay."  So, things happen the way they're supposed to.  So, we ended up with NBC anyway because CBS passed on it.  Norman saw it as a play in New York [New York], Brandon saw it as a television show, I saw it as the movie of the week.  So, then when we started doing it, I said we can't do what we did in the play, because it's outdated, it's the '50s [1950s] and with all the prejudice and segregation and all that, we can't do that, that's not interesting.  So, I ended up helping to write the pilot for the show.  So, after a lot of conglomeration that went on, we ended up shooting the pilot, and the pilot sold in New York.  And so then, they tried to backtrack and change it, and it wasn't going anywhere, so I said, "Why don't we kill the landlord, shoot the pilot, kill the landlord and move on."  So, we did that.  Showed the pilot, and we went on from there, and it was a funny episode.

Speaker 1: It was a great show ['227'].
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was.
Speaker 1: It showed how black families can do--they can survive, they can do it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, and then we had lessons in comedy, as well as comedy, you know.  So, I wrote three episodes on there.  One was the homeless episode, which I was hoping it would take off, you know, because it was the solution for the--a lot of the people we hired were homeless.  Ted Hayes was a friend of mine, so he brought a lot of the homeless people in.  And they, I mean, they really were good.  But the first thing they did was, they'd clean them up, give them a wardrobe, and I said, "No, we want to see the homeless." But, their idea of homeless--they'd clean it up and change it, but they were saying, "No, we could really do this.  I really like this."  And I was saying, with all the shows that they do where they have all the extras, you could have a certain portion of them come out the homeless, and give them a chance to get on their feet and get off the street.  But a lot of the people who were extras started protesting, "What is Marla [HistoryMaker Marla Gibbs] talking about?  We're having a hard enough time as it is."  Until you end up on the street, then you'll understand the difference.  So, they were trying to figure out how to do it.  So, I said, ""Well let's have me have a dream, and in my dream, I can be anything."  So, then the audience buys into it, and they get a chance to see what's going on with the homeless.  It started with a homeless person, Brenda [Brenda Jenkins], coming home and coming upstairs to get something to give to them, and I was telling her, "Don't talk to--I told you don't talk to strangers," and she couldn't understand it.  So, we have me falling asleep and I dream I fall asleep on the bench outside of Pearl's [Pearl Shay] window, and when I wake up, I try to go upstairs and Paul Winfield [sic. Julian C. Barlow] won't let me in, because--he's shooing me with a broom, "Get away from here."  And I'm trying to figure out, what the hell's wrong with him?  And then I look, and I see my husband ['227' character, Lester Jenkins] and my daughter coming down the street and I run up to them and I kiss him, and he's saying, "Get away from me." And Brenda's saying, "My mother told me never to talk to strangers."  (Laughter) So, I end up at the bus stop, and I meet Ted Hayes, who tells me about the other homeless people in the park, and I can go there and get something to eat.  So, we go to the park, and I get something to eat, and I meet all these people.  So, we end up, at the end of the show, going back to the park and taking food to the homeless.  So, it was a rewarding show to do.

Speaker 1: Regina King was a young girl, and you made a star out of her.
Speaker 2: No.  She was already a star.  That child had been acting when we put her in the play, '227' [Christine Houston].  She was already coming out of another workshop, so she'd been performing for two or three years before then.  And by the time we got ready to do the show, she was old enough--the other girl was too old--she was just old enough, and she looked like Hal [Hal Williams].  They both had sandy hair, you know, they both looked--she looked like she could really be his daughter, so we hired Regina.
Speaker 1: Great move, great, great actress.
Speaker 2: She's such a wonderful actress.
Speaker 1: I see that even today, every time I see her, I always--
Speaker 2: She's the same, she says, "Mommy," (laughter).
Speaker 1: She's got kids of her own now.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: She's got kids of her own now.  Hal Williams.  You guys, the chemistry (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We had such a chemistry.  We were in the play, we did the play for six months, so I insisted on having him. And so they didn't want to give him his money, so I held out until I got him and because I said, "Listen, you want to do this show, we don't have that much time. I don't want to worry about having to try to get a chemistry with another actor.  We already got the chemistry, all we have to do is worry about the lines.  Once we get those lines, we can keep going."  So, they were happy that they did that.  And of course, all the men really identified with him, which was good.
Speaker 1: He was a good man.  When he had to go in his pocket, he did that.  When we had to give a little love, he gave that.  Whatever he had to do, he helped keep the family together.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: How's he doing these days?
Speaker 2: He's doing fine.  I haven't talked to him for a while, but he sent me a card for my birthday, he always keeps up with my birthday.   He's in Palm Springs [California] now. So, I tell him he's moved out of the country (laughter).
Speaker 1: And there was crazy Pearl [Pearl Shay].
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, that's another person I asked for.  I asked for Pearl, because we had a blind man in the play, and he did a whole lot of--was it Art Evans that played that?  We had a blind man in the play, and it was funny because the blind man was nosey, he'd hear everything, you know.  And he'd do things out the window that you didn't think a blind man could do.  But that's funnier in a play than it is in television, so they didn't want the blind man.  So, I said, "Look, let me have Helen Martin."  So, they agreed to that right away.  I said, "Because we need somebody, a senior, who's able to say whatever she wants to say and don't care what you think about it."  And of course, that was Pearl.  She said whatever she had to say, and did not care what you thought (laughter).
Speaker 1: She had a Ph.D. (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: She was so real (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We had a great cast, and then we had Rose [Rose Lee Holloway], Alaina [Alaina Reed-Hall], and then we were casting for Jackee [sic. Sandra Clark], and they wanted Sheryl Lee Ralph, and I said, "No, Sheryl Lee Ralph just came off Broadway.  Nobody would believe she lives in this building."  Jackee [HistoryMaker Jackee Harry] was a little overweight and her hair was shorter then, and she'd wear a tight dress, she looked ridiculous. So, she was funny, and she was trying to do Mae West, you know.  So, she was hysterical, plus all the little things that she does.  And that character just grew.  They said, "She'll only be seven out of thirteen," and I said, "Whatever."  She ended up every show.
Speaker 1: She was a strange lady.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was good.
Story_ID: 419815
Speaker 1: But the show, '227,' to get that kind of an ensemble cast together, it furthered your career.
Speaker 2: The show is the star.  When you treat the show like a star, you come out on top every time.  But when one person wants to be star, and everything revolves around them, there's a problem.  So, I told them, "Jackee [HistoryMaker Jackee Harry] is good.  You can give her the A show, but I got to have the family."  They wanted the show to be me and Jackee, and I said, "It doesn't work, our rhythms are too different."  I said, "Jackee can do what she does with a rabbit, with a mirror, by herself, she does not need me, you know."  I said, "That works for her, I don't want to change it, it works for her.  It doesn't work for me."  I said, "I have to have something--you have to hit me the ball and I'll hit it back, and you got to hit back again. If I hit the ball to Jackee, she may not hit it back."  (Laughter) Because Jackee was more interested in being a star, and that's the way people thought coming up in New York [New York], you know.  Who was the star? Who was this, that and the other, and I wasn't used to that.  I was used to being number nine on a hit show that I worked up to be number three on, but I never forgot that number one and number two were the stars.  And it worked.  I said, "You got the best of both worlds.  You can give her the A story if you want, and give us the B story, but as long as you give me the family, I'm fine."  And that's what kept the show.  I said, "Besides, people would not believe that I would let Jackee in my house.  Why would I let her in?"  I said, "I let her in because Rose [Rose Lee Holloway] is knocking on the door."  I said, "And when she gets on my nerves, I can't hit her because Rose gets in between us."  So, that's what makes it real.
Speaker 1: I see Nia Long was in the original production that you worked with.  You had some great artists at Crossroads [Crossroads Arts Academy and Theater, Los Angeles, California].  You had some great artists.
Speaker 2: Nia Long was in which production?
Speaker 1: Nia Long starred in the original production of '227' [Christine Houston] at Crossroads?  Was she an original in it?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head).
Speaker 1: Do you know a fellow by the name of Dasch Hadu?
Speaker 2: Sounds familiar.
Speaker 1: Glenn Towery?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yes.
Speaker 1: He is my dear friend.
Speaker 2: We wanted him for the play we did.  He played the wolf boy, and he was perfect, but Ed Cambridge would not cast him in that role.
Speaker 1: He's doing some work here in town. Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We fought for him.  Glen Towery.
Speaker 1: Glen Towery. Yeah, he changed his name.  I think he goes by the name of Dasch Hadu.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Story_ID: 419816
Speaker 1: You did a lot of different things as time came on.  In 1990, you then opened up the Vision Theatre Complex [Vision Theatre, Los Angeles, California] and began operating that.  Earlier, you spoke about what you wanted to get out of Vision, and you also spoke about what didn't happen.  What did you learn out of that experience, the Vision?
Speaker 2: That you have to do the dreams that you want to.  You can't decide what other people need.  A lot of times we go into the community and we decide what they need, and we open up things, but you know, if they're not involved, it's what you think they want.  It's not necessarily what they want, so they're not going to support it, you know.  So, a lot of people didn't have any money to support it.  So, I was trying to do their vision instead of my vision.  I never knew what I really wanted to do, so I always think in terms of being of service.  But, that time was ending and I needed to have a dream of my own.  So, I learned that you got to do your dream.  When you're all right, everybody else is all right.  If you're not all right, you can't help nobody else, you know.
Speaker 1: The building is still there?
Speaker 2: No. They tore the building down.  The theater is still there (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay. But I mean, the theater is still there.  And, your picture is still up there?
Speaker 2: It's in the--they made a museum in the lobby, because I always wanted a museum, but I wanted a museum based on Egyptian history, and so it's not the same museum I had in mind.
Story_ID: 419817
Speaker 1: What are some of your future plans?  What do you have in the future that you want to do?
Speaker 2: I still want to work.  I would like to do another television show (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Hollywood, are you listening.  Hollywood, are you listening (laughter)?
Speaker 2: And I would like to do a film, but without the stereotypical parts that they think a woman of my genre should be doing, because we have the same desires and capabilities as everyone else, you know.  We still fall in love, we still want to date, and not just be seniors or--I don't like titles, that's why I'm thirty, so I don't have to pay attention to any of that, and just think about what it is I want to do, because God is available to you to do that.  So, I'm still waiting for that to happen, and working, and taking my steps so that it can happen, you know.
Speaker 1: Do you think you'll ever turn thirty-one?
Speaker 2: No, because then I'd have to go to thirty-two (laughter).  I'll just stay on thirty, because then people would start adding it up for you.  "No, you were thirty last year."  "And, I'm thirty again this year."  And they'll say, "How old are you going to be on the next?"  Sometimes they say, "I know you're thirty-nine."  And I said, "No, I don't know why you all keep putting numbers behind thirty, it's just thirty.  There's no 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. You're trying to push me to forty," (laughter).
Story_ID: 419818
Speaker 1: Sadly, you did lose your sister in 1971, in 2002? In 2002?
Speaker 2: Oh, Susie [Susie Garrett], you mean?
Speaker 1: Susie, yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was thinking of Louise [Vera Louise Bradley].  Sadly, yes.  She succumbed to cancer.  We stayed close, we talked on the phone almost every day, but you know, when it's time for people to go, we never know when that is.  I would ask her, "Do you think it's time?"  She'd say, "No."  People will also say, "No, I still got a lot to do," but they don't do the things that will help--they don't act like they want to stay, so that gives you an inkling that maybe then it's time for them, you think it's time, you know.  So, I don't know if anybody--but every time somebody passes, when you talk to someone in the family, they have said something to let them know that it was time for them to go, inadvertently.  Even young people, they say something.  But what I know is that if we believe in God, then we know leaving is not leaving.  So, it's not a terrible thing that's happening, it's just that we are going to miss them.
Story_ID: 419819
Speaker 1: How do want you want to best be remembered, ma'am?
Speaker 2: That I contributed, that I gave love, and that I lived what I preached, you know.  And, you know, something happened when I got sick, and that whole thing was missing, and then I came back and I had to learn to talk again and write again.  It's like a strange thought, what happened?  Why did this happen, you know?  And so I don't have a clear memory.  I was going to the theater, Theater West [Los Angeles, California], to see Lee Meriwether, and what's his name, not Jeff [Jeff Bridges]--Beau Bridges--do 'Love Letters' [A.R. Gurney] and I had never seen the production.  And I was doing an interview, a TV interview, and Lee Meriwether was there, and she was doing it too.  And she told me what she was doing, because I always really liked her.  And she said, "I'm doing 'Love Letters'."  And I said, "Well, I've never seen that production."  So, she said, "Well you should come and see it."  I said, "I like Beau Bridges, too."  So, she got me two tickets, and she called my house and left the information, and I told my sister, and we went up, and I parked across the street and ran in there, and we went in to get our seats and I said, "You know what, I think I'll go to the bathroom before we sit down, because I don't want to have to go later."  So, I got up and went to the bathroom, and as I came out, I leaned over to flush the toilet, and I heard something go pop up in my head, and I said, what is that?  So, I went and looked in the mirror, and I said, what the hell was that?  And I said, whatever that was, it wasn't good.  So, I kind of backed up to the door in the bathroom, and I kept looking in the mirror.  I don't know what I was waiting for.  It was like something happened to say it's okay to walk out, and that's where they found me, on the floor.  They say I was curled up on the floor.  So, then they, my sister said they said over the loudspeaker, "Is anyone here with [HistoryMaker] Marla Gibbs?"  So, she got up.  They took me to the hospital in the ambulance and she called my daughter [Angela Elayne Gibbs] and them, then they got down.  My daughter decided she didn't like the hospital I was in, and didn't like what they were saying, because they were saying, "She may never be the same as you know.  Her life as you know it is over."  And she was telling my sons [Jordan Gibbs, Jr. and Dorian Gibbs], "Now, we don't have to accept that, that's not the true."  So, my children are on the same spiritual line that I'm on.  So, her friend, Diane [ph.], is an attorney, and she knows Dr. Black [ph.].
Story_ID: 420893
Speaker 1: You know Roz Stevenson [sic. Roz Ryan]?
Speaker 2: Ron Stevenson?
Speaker 1: Roz Stevenson.
Speaker 2: Oh, Roz, from 'Amen'?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: From 'Amen'?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  We all did a thing, a dinner for Sherman [Sherman Hemsley].
Speaker 2: Got you.
Speaker 1: Did a tribute for Sherman.
Speaker 2: You were mentioning Dr. Black [ph.] (unclear).
Speaker 1: Yeah, so my daughter [Angela Elayne Gibbs] called.  Her friend Diane [ph.], she knew Dr. Black, so she gave her the number and she called Dr. Black, and she told him what the hospital was saying, and that they wanted to go in and they wanted to put a clip in my head and so they said they did it.  He says that wasn't true, you know.  So, he arranged for us to get into Cedars [Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California].  So we got into Cedars and she asked him would he do the operation.  He said, "I do tumors, but--."
Story_ID: 420894
Speaker 1: So he referred us to Dr. Shebinsky [ph.], who turned out to be my surgeon and who turned out to be the one we should have.  He did an excellent job.  He was an expert at doing these kind of operations.
Speaker 2: At that moment you, as you go into the surgery, to his room--
Speaker 1: I don't know anything.
Speaker 2: Don't remember anything?
Speaker 1: I don't know anything.
Speaker 2: You didn't have a chance to think?
Speaker 1: From the time I hit the bathroom 'til I woke up in rehab, I don't remember anything in the hospital.  I thought I was in the hospital, but I was in rehab.
Speaker 2: How much of a timeframe was that, how many days was that?
Speaker 1: I guess we're talking about maybe a couple of days, from the hospital over to recuperating.  But that's when I woke up, I was in the rehab on (unclear).   Yeah, I don't remember anything in the hospital.  And I was so hard-headed that I wanted to get up and go to the bathroom, and they have the diapers stuff on you.  At first they had a catheter in me, and they said, "You got a catheter."  But I felt like I had to go to the bathroom, so.  Then they took the catheter out, and they have a diaper on you, but I wanted to go to the bathroom, so I kept getting up and I kept falling (laughter), so the day when I was leaving, the nurse said, "We've all been scared of you," because I would not--they would tie me in the bed, and I would figure out to untie it, and I'd work on untying it, and get up and be on the floor again.  And I said Marla [HistoryMaker Marla Gibbs], now we got to stop doing this, we're on the floor again (laughter).  And I could not get up.
Speaker 2: But God wasn't ready for you yet.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: It wasn't your time.
Speaker 1: No, my journey was not complete, so I said I've got to stop wasting time and start doing what it is--so, stop being lazy, because for a while, I just wanted to lay there and look at TV, and didn't want to get up and do nothing.  So, I went to rehab--in the rehabilitation center, I went down to rehab, and I was doing pretty well in there.  So, then they let me come home.  And I would turn on the TV, and I'd be looking at TV and my daughter [Angela Elayne Gibbs] said, "Well, I'm bringing the trainer over, and we're going to start training."  So, I said, "Okay."  The young lady named Felicia King [ph.], who is a good trainer, she comes over and we work out.  I had a lot of stuff in my house, you know.  And then I was doing Pilates, so I'm waiting to go back to Pilates.  You always feel like you got to be strong enough to go back to Pilates, you know. You just can't go to Pilates (laughter).
Speaker 2: Look at that smile, that smile is still there.  That flame in your eyes is still there.
Speaker 1: You see a flame?
Speaker 2: I see a flame.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) It's still there, ma'am, it's still there.  We thank the Lord for that every day.
Story_ID: 420895
Speaker 1: Back earlier, you mentioned 'Vagina Monologues' ['The Vagina Monologues,' Eve Ensler].  You played that, you did that for a minute.  You ever think about coming back to it again?
Speaker 2: I did do it again, with Penny Marshall.  We did it, I think, at the Wilshire Ebell [sic. Wilshire Ebell Theatre, Los Angeles, California] and that was a nice experience, but been there, done that.  I did a play, a Neil Simon play, in Overland Park, Kansas.  I'd never been to Kansas, and it was the most wonderful experience.  I guess that was a year ago, and we stopped in June, yeah, 2006.  So, I had my thirtieth birthday there again. And they did such a remarkable thing on my birthday.  They are such loving people.  They have a dinner theater [New Theatre Restaurant, Overland Park, Kansas], and the most successful dinner theater in the country--good food, and they have it down to a science, they really know how to do it.  And the two partners that do it, Richard [Richard Carrothers] and [Dennis D. Hennessy]--it's not coming right now--anyway, it was two partners that do it, and they are so wonderful.  One of them takes in dogs, (laughter) like I used to be--and he takes them all for a walk and they all get along fine, and he feeds them and people bring dogs, and they say, "You know my wife and I got married."  He said, "My wife doesn't want the dog.  She's getting ready to have a baby and she doesn't want the dog around."  And he's crying because he's had this dog so long.  So he took the dog for him, you know.
Speaker 1: I do remember you said you have a loving for stray dogs.
Speaker 2: Yes.  So, he has such a good heart.  Anyway, we did this play called 'Proposals.'  It was a Neil Simon play.  And he said, "I had you in mind for this play."  I was like why are these people in Overland Park thinking about me?  Things will just come up where people are thinking about you, and you wonder why, you know.  And, he said, "So I didn't have anyone to play the part, and then I thought about you.  When you said yes, then I could do it." He said, "I've been wanting to do this play for ten years."  So, we did the play, and it got very good reviews, and my birthday came around and I told him I was thirty.  So, I came to work--they had a car for me, they had a condo, not a--a house for me, and they had somebody come clean the house on Wednesdays, and somebody to pick up the car and wash it and put gas in it on Wednesdays.  And the house was just phenomenal, it had everything, everything you could think of in it.  It was just remarkable, so anyway, I could drive home from the theater, it wasn't that far.  And so, between shows when we have like two shows on I think Saturday, and two shows on Sunday, in between, I would go home.  I would go home and I would eat lunch, and I then I'd come back.  So, when I came back, I could hardly get in my dressing room when I opened it.  They had all these balloons, big balloons, all these balloons in there, and then streamers hanging down that said thirty, thirty, thirty, thirty.  And then little things all over, things with thirty, the preferred age and all kinds of little things with thirty on them.  I said, how did they even think of all this?  So, everybody said, "Did you see your dressing room?"  This was the--no, when I first got to the theater for the first show, and then I went home and came back, they had a chance to do the rest of them.  I came back, and all down the hall, all down into the green room, everything was hanging, thirties and balloons, just everything.  Now, at the end of the show, I usually take a bow, and then I kind of kick my leg up, and the audience falls out laughing.  Before I could do that, the lights come on, and everybody is standing, and they're all singing 'Happy Birthday.'  Then they say, "Hit it," and all the lights go out.  And they had given them all a flashlight that said, "Happy thirtieth, Marla [HistoryMaker Marla Gibbs]," and you press it, and a blue light comes on.  They were all shining the blue light up there, and I think it was 640 seats, something like that.  And you see all these lights, it was just--and I felt like crying, but I didn't want to miss anything, so I couldn't cry (laughter).  Then after the show, they took me across the street for drinks and dinner, and they came out with a cake that had candles that said thirty.  I don't know how they found all these things that said thirty.  I brought as many back as I could, so the kids could see it.  It was just the most wonderful experience, and the most loving people.  So, they were looking for something else for me to do, and they were trying to see if I could find anything, and I didn't find anything yet.
Speaker 1: What did the GG say about this birthday party?  Your GG--
Speaker 2: My GG son [Gibbs' great-grandson, Samuel Christian]?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well, he came down, they all came down to see the show, and my daughter [Angela Elayne Gibbs] came and my grandson [Amilcar Gibbs] came, and he brought his wife [Adriana Gibbs], and my GG son, and afterwards, my GG son said, "I wanted to see what was backstage."  So, they took him backstage, and he got to see the set and where the kitchen was and all of that.   And then my stepdaughters came from out of town to see it.  So, we had a good time shopping, and showing them all around Overland Park.  I knew Overland Park backwards and forwards, it's a very small town, and it's right outside Kansas City [Kansas].  It's so close, it's like a suburb, you know.

Speaker 1: Earlier, you talked about The Supremes and [HistoryMaker] Berry Gordy.  Did you ever have any contact with The Supremes in your career (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no. They would have been closer to my daughter [Angela Elayne Gibbs] anyway.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: She just knew they were over there, but we never, we never went over there.
Speaker 1: The Supremes, Berry Gordy, Motown [Motown Records], Detroit [Michigan] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I see him now.  I see him because [HistoryMaker] Janie Bradford has the HAL Awards, Heroes and Legends.  We go to that every year.
Speaker 1: We go every year.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That is a wonderful awards show.
Speaker 2: It is.
Speaker 1: Yes.  She really puts a whole year's worth of effort into it.
Speaker 2: She does, yeah.  So, I support her every year.
Speaker 1: And who's that crazy lady she has as the master of ceremonies (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter)  Jo Marie Payton (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Jo Marie Payton.
Speaker 2: It's always a wond- it's a fellowship in this town [Los Angeles, California].  Can you talk about the fellowship among the black actors in this town please?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, there is a, there is a fellowship, especially among the females, too.  There is kinship, and that's what you feel, find when you go to Friends Three [ph.], the same thing.  Even whether you know them intimately or not, there's a respect and love that I get from all of them.
Speaker 2: And good food.
Speaker 1: And good food, yes (laughter).

Speaker 1: Is there anything else that you want to talk about, any other parts of your life that you want to let people know about?
Speaker 2: I'm getting ready to write a book with my daughter [Angela Elayne Gibbs], has been talking me into writing a book, so she's getting ready to start interviewing me for it.
Speaker 1: You got a possible title?
Speaker 2: 'It's Never Too Late.'  And, we're trying to do a TV show like that, too.  Because, it's never too late applies to everyone.  There are so many people who get to a certain age, and they feel like if they didn't do it, it's too late, they don't have any more time, but it's not.  And since I've been going around speaking about I'm thirty, and it's never too late, women come up to me and say, "I'm glad you said that, you know, I've been wanting to do something, and I'm going to do that."  And I said, "Good for you."  So, I'm getting that a lot, and I know a lot of people need to hear that.  And a lot of young people think it's too late, because either they've been in jail or they've done something wrong, and now it's too late to turn it around, or they failed in school and it's too late to go back and just--anybody who thinks it's too late for anything, it's not.
Speaker 1: We will thank you much for a project like that, it's never too late.
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm hoping to get with the right people to do it.  It would be a good place for TV One if they want it, you know.  But everybody has their own criteria for what they're trying to show.  You can't do everything, and I understand that, but you will be at the right place, and whoever takes it will be the right one to take it, and I know that.
Speaker 1: Outstanding.  Again we--
Speaker 2: But we will shop it, and we will see.
Speaker 1: We thank you very, very much for taking the time to become a HistoryMaker.  We thank you very much.
Speaker 2: And thank you for having me, and thank you for jogging my mind, because I never know how my memory is going to be behind this illness, you know.  I don't know how much I've lost, or not lost.  But, you have jogged it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Outstanding.  Like I said, that flame, that's that flame.
