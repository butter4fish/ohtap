Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe. I'm interviewer today with The HistoryMakers. Our videographer is Matthew Hickey. Ma'am, can you please state your full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: My name is Pamela Jo Gunter-Smith, P-A-M-E-L-A J-O G-U-N-T-E-R hyphen S-M-I-T-H.
Speaker 1: Okay, and is there a story behind your name?
Speaker 2: Not really. I guess that in terms of thinking about it my mother's initials were P.J. Her name was Pearl Jean, so my initials are P.J. They put a name together that would fit that. And my maiden name was Gunter. When I married, I hyphenated it so Gunter-Smith is my father's name and my husband's name.
Speaker 1: Okay. And ma'am, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: So my date of birth is December 2nd, 1951, Nashville, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: Currently I am provost and academic vice president of Drew University.
Speaker 1: Okay. And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is March 11th, 2013.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: Present time we're in Founders Room in Mead Hall at Drew University in Madison, New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25870
Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we ask as sort of a warm up and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Good.
Speaker 1: The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Do I have a favorite food, chocolate, anything chocolate.
Speaker 1: Okay. Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Red.
Speaker 1: Alright. Favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Spring.
Speaker 1: Okay, favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: The Caribbean.
Speaker 1: And the last question is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Favorite phrase or saying? I had this figured out, now I've forgotten what it was. But I think I will say, "it is what it is."
Story_ID: 25871
Speaker 1: Can you give us first your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: So my mother's full name was Pearl Jeanne Kennedy, P-E-A-R-L J-E-A-N-N-E K-E-N-N-E-D-Y.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in Marianna, Arkansas, January 28th, 1931.
Speaker 1: And what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family? How far back can you trace them and what are the stories that are passed down in the family?
Speaker 2: So my mother came from a farming family. Her father was a farmer. We still have that farm in Arkansas, Marianna, Arkansas. We call it the Kennedy Farm. We no longer farm it ourselves but we do rent it out to others who do farm it. My--the farm actually came down through my grandfather's family. He had a number of brothers and it's always been a family farm. Her mother, Lucille Hamilton Kennedy was a school teacher. She lived in the City of Marianna. My grandfather lived out on the farm. She was a home economics teacher and she taught sewing so I remember as a little girl I had to learn how to make dresses and curtains and my mother and her family had gone through the depression so they thought it was important that you knew how to do that because you wouldn't always be able to buy your clothes so it's important that you learn how to do that. Both my mother's parents were college educated. My grandfather went to Philander Smith [College in Arkansas]. My grandmother went to a number of schools, one of them being Hampton Institute. And her--my grandmother's family came from Alton, Illinois. She was the youngest of four children. You want me to go that far back?
Speaker 1: Sure, back as far as you can go.
Speaker 2: Okay. She was the youngest of four children. She had a brother named Wilbur, Jr., they called Buddy, and she had two sisters, one Mary Hamilton and the other was Pearl Hamilton. My mother was named after that sister, Pearl. Their father, Wilbur, was a glassmaker. In fact we still have some of the pieces of glass that he made.
Speaker 1: So great-grandfather then--
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, my great grandfather, yes.
Speaker 1: Wilbur Hamilton.
Speaker 2: Wilbur Hamilton.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was married twice. He was married first to Bessie Fowler who is the natural mother of my grandmother, my great grandmother. She died very young and in 1919, my great grandfather moved the family to Marianna, Arkansas with my grandmother's step mother, Millie B. Hamilton. That is about as far back as we go on my mother's side of the family. I don't know very much about the Kennedys who were the ancestors of her father and were the individuals with the farm.
Story_ID: 25872
Speaker 1: But my grandfather led a very interesting life. He was in the navy during the time in which black people were not in the navy. He traveled the world. He drove a Jitney in Atlantic City [New Jersey]. There are pictures of him out in California. When the farm became distressed, he moved--
Speaker 2: Now wait a minute.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry. Just, were there--
Speaker 1: Sorry.
Speaker 2: --pictures of him in California doing what? What was he doing?
Speaker 1: Pictures in his uniform standing next to a fancy car, that type of thing.
Speaker 2: Oh, so just pictures of him in his various travels around--?
Speaker 1: Pictures of him in his various travels around.
Speaker 2: So he was in the United States Navy and--?
Speaker 1: He was in the United States Navy and served on a vessel during the time.
Speaker 2: Okay. Now this would be during what period of time? This would be what, turn of the century around, that time?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: When the farm was in distress he moved back to Marianna [Arkansas] and saved the farm.
Speaker 2: Did he serve in World War I?
Speaker 1: I would imagine that was World War I.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay. And you're right like the navy was really rough on black sailors. At a certain point they didn't allow them (unclear).
Speaker 1: Well he was not--at that time he was Caucasian. That's--so he was in the navy but not as a black man.
Speaker 2: Okay. So was he considered a white person or was he passing for a white person?
Speaker 1: He was passing for a white person at that time.
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah which is all in the language of today it means that you look white but you--
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: --biologically you probably were but because you had black ancestry people would consider you black and so you'd have to--
Speaker 1: Exactly, and that entire side of the family were very, very fair. All of them were very fair. And there were other relatives living out in California who no longer came home because they were back in those days passing.
Speaker 2: Now what was your--
Speaker 1: But my grandfather came back.
Speaker 2: Now what was your grandfather's name? I didn't get his name.
Speaker 1: Oh, his name was Claude Clark Kennedy, Sr.
Speaker 2: Okay, and your grandmother?
Speaker 1: My grandmother was Lucille Hamilton Kennedy.
Speaker 2: Okay, alright. Okay, so you had a grandfather who was in the navy and traveling around. And so at a certain point he retired from the navy and came back to--?
Speaker 1: So at some point he left the navy, I don't know when. But because the farm was in distress they were about the lose it. He moved back to Marianna to save the farm. He saved the farm from foreclosure. And he, when he moved back to Marianna, he met my then to be grandmother and he married later in life. He was about 40 or so by the time he got married and they have--had two children, my, one, my mother [Pearl Jeanne Kennedy] who is deceased and the other is my uncle who still lives in Marianna.
Speaker 2: Okay. Now--oh okay, I'm just trying to figure out.
Speaker 1: Sorry if I confused you.
Speaker 2: He got married at age 40.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And was that shortly after he came back?
Speaker 1: That was after he came back, probably shortly--I don't know all the times but it was after he left the navy and stopped his traveling around, moved back to Marianna to save the farm. That's when he met my grandmother who was living there with her father and stepmother and they subsequently married.
Speaker 2: Okay, alright. Then your mother was born in '31 [1931] so I'm thinking okay, so he was 40. Alright, okay. So this would have been in the late 20s [1920s] I guess or--?
Speaker 1: Yes, late 20s [1920s], cause I think they actually married in 1930.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: 1929, some time in that time period.
Speaker 2: Okay, alright. I'm just trying to figure it out, okay. Alright, so the farm in Marianna is still in the family and still--?
Speaker 1: The farm is still in the family. We no longer farm it but we rent it out to farmers in the area.
Speaker 2: Okay. And you said your grandmother attended Hampton and some other schools?
Speaker 1: Hampton Institute and a school in Pine Bluff [Arkansas]. I've forgotten the name of it right now.
Speaker 2: Oh, University of Arkansas AM&N.
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like that. Well, but it was normal and something.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, yes. So she went to a couple of places to finish her degree.
Speaker 2: Okay. And he went to you said he went to Philander Smith?
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah that's in Little Rock.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So yeah, okay.
Story_ID: 25873
Speaker 1: So now your, so your mother [Pearl Jeanne Kennedy], she was born in 1931.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: What did she say about growing up and what it was like? Did she grow up in Marianna?
Speaker 2: She grew up in Marianna and she was a kid during the depression so that's why she was always--my mother was a very good money manager. In that day you always saved for the depression. You didn't have a lot. They had a lot of food from the farm. Even as a kid every Christmas we would get half a cow or half a pig. That's kind of what you would, you would do. She went to Robert R. Moton High School in Marianna, Arkansas and she split her time between the city and the country. But my mom wanted to leave Marianna. That was not, you know growing up I--they were comfortable but they didn't have a lot. And Marianna was much too small for my mom. So she left Marianna to go to Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Okay. I just want to point out that Robert R. Moton, that is named after Robert R. Moton who was the second in command of Tuskegee--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --and later the head of Tuskegee Institute. So it was a black, all black high school and probably fairly new judging by the name. I don't know if it was new or not but I, the name would have been something that would have been on the minds of people.
Speaker 2: Well I used to spend summers with my grandparents and we'll get to this. But when my mother went to graduate school to get her doctorate I actually lived with my grandmother for two years so I went to the school. There was just one, because of segregation, it was one huge school for the county which was Lee County in Marianna, Arkansas so I actually attended the school for two years like the fourth and maybe the fifth and sixth grade, some time like that.
Speaker 1: Is this the kind of school where all the grades are in one school from grade school to high school?
Speaker 2: All of the grades were in one school but it was a huge school and the interesting thing, you know how you start thinking about these memories, was that everyone worked on a farm. We raised cotton during that time. Cotton was king and so the school time and vacations were time for when you had to do things for cotton. So you were out of school in the fall for picking cotton and you were out of school like in May or early June to chop cotton. So you actually went to school like in July and August and then you were out and then you would go back to school because everybody was involved somehow in the cotton industry because that was what they were growing. It's the Mississippi Delta land outside of Memphis. I tried my hand at picking cotton once. I made fifteen cents and I lasted two hours.
Speaker 1: So you knew you'd better be a scientist--?
Speaker 2: I knew I'd better do something else because picking cotton was not going to work for me. My granddad let me try it though.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25874
Speaker 1: So your mother [Pearl Jeanne Kennedy] went to Fisk [University]. Now what did she pursue at Fisk?
Speaker 2: So she actually got interested in dancing and dance and I believe that her degree from Fisk probably, I'm not really sure, was in P.E. So she pursued that at Fisk in Nashville [Tennessee] and actually studied dancing while she was there.
Speaker 1: So this would be around 1948 or '49 [1949] or so?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, 1948, '49 [1949]. Okay, so she studied dance.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: That's interesting, okay.
Speaker 2: And she actually went to New York I think probably for a summer and danced with someone who was very famous. I've forgotten what the name of that person--
Speaker 1: This would be a black person or--?
Speaker 2: I don't recall. That I don't remember. But this was time when Fisk was in his heyday, Jubilee Singers, that type of thing.
Speaker 1: And when Robert S. Johnson was probably the president, yeah.
Speaker 2: I don't, that I don't remember.
Speaker 1: I'm thinking he probably was there, but--okay, but so she went to New York and danced.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay. So did she dance professionally in New York?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay. She went there to study.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, well that's something I--
Speaker 2: I have wonderful pictures of her. I didn't bring those though of when she was a dancer.
Speaker 1: Okay. So well, what did she end up doing in New York or did she stay there?
Speaker 2: So she, when she was in college she met my dad. My dad always, I always kind of chuckle, liked younger women. He was 13 years her senior. Somehow she was introduced to him when he was, when she was about 16. She married him when he was about 18--when she was about 18 and he was 31. So you know quite an age difference but people did that during that time. So she stayed in Nashville and she was on the faculty at Fisk and was, I remember being a kid, she was a P.E. instructor at Fisk. And she taught dance and she taught badminton and volley ball. And I remember the time when she was teaching volley ball and jammed her finger and that's when she decided that she needed to go back to school because she was too old to be getting jammed fingers. So she went to Tennessee State [University] and got a Masters, I believe in education and then went to the University of Tennessee in Knoxville to get her doctorate in education. And I would imagine she was probably when, by the time she got her doctorate just thinking about the picture, she was in her early Thirties, probably around 30, 31. And she was the first woman to graduate from, first African American woman to graduate from her department. She did her dissertation on desegregation in Nashville in the school system.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25875
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Marcus Hutto Beanard Gunter, M-A-R-C-U-S H-U-T-T-O B-E-A-N-A-R-D G-U-N-T-E-R.
Speaker 1: Okay. And is there a story behind his name? Sounds very German or something.
Speaker 2: So, it is very German. His ancestry of the Gunter's is a family name out of Shelbyville, Tennessee. We don't know much about that side of the family. They're very, very lost past my paternal grandfather and I think Hutto was a physician in Nashville that he was named after. Beanard I'm not sure of but you don't see something like Hutto all the time so that was always part of a conversation about how he got that name.
Speaker 1: Okay. And well what is your father's date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born in Nashville, Tennessee. I think his date of birth is January 23rd, 1918.
Speaker 1: Okay, 19, January 23rd, 1918.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, that would be about right if my mom was born in '31 [1931], given the difference in their ages.
Speaker 1: So how far can you trace your father's family back and what are the stories about his side?
Speaker 2: So I'll start with the shortest one first which is my father's father's family because that gets lost very quickly. In my, dad's family there were five of them. There were two girls and three boys. That was also during the time of the depression. People didn't have a lot but my grandfather sent every one of those kids to college. My dad went to Tuskegee in Tuskegee, Alabama. One aunt went to Fisk University. One brother went to Fisk and the other two went to Tennessee State which was then Tennessee State A&I Agricultural and Industrial College. My grandfather I hear, he died before I was born so I never knew him, was very conservative, provincial type of gentleman. The girls were not supposed to do any type of hard work. My grandmother was a homemaker. She never worked outside of the home which was unusual. He was well known in Nashville and was the type of man who took care of everyone else in the city. Therefore, everyone knew my family in Nashville.
Speaker 1: Now what was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was William Gunter, Sr.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: His father we know nothing about. The story is that he was born of a union between a black woman and a white male in Shelbyville, Tennessee. There are many Gunters in Shelbyville, Tennessee. He somehow got to Nashville and was the stable boy, was kind of a homeless person. Two white physicians in Nashville took him under their wing. He lived on top of I think at Vanderbilt University in one of the buildings. But what's interesting is that he became what is known as the Deaner for, of the anatomy labs for Vanderbilt School of Medicine and he served Vanderbilt School of Medicine for nearly 50 years.
Speaker 1: Now what is the Deaner?
Speaker 2: So he was the person who prepared the cadavers for the medical students. And as a result, I never understood why if any of us ever got very ill in Nashville we always went to Vanderbilt and we were always treated by the white doctors because it was Bill Gunters family that was ill or needed some help and I never understood that till much, much later. So he prepared the cadavers for the medical students. I hear he also bought them whiskey and for the late nights when they were working on the bodies.
Story_ID: 25876
Speaker 1: But the other thing that he did was that from that background he and his sons bought a funeral home in Nashville, William Gunter & Sons. And so the family business was the funeral business and my dad [Marcus Hutto Beanard Gunter] and his two brothers worked with their dad in that business in Nashville.
Speaker 2: So William Gunter & Sons--
Speaker 1: Funeral Home.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And unfortunately it burned two years ago and we've lost it.
Speaker 2: Okay, so it's no longer in existence?
Speaker 1: It's no longer in existence.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The--so my family buried all of the black middle class families in Nashville. My uncle, my dad's brother was a professional photographer and he had his business in the same building of the funeral home. And so he took all of the pictures, Meharry [Meharry Medical College], Fisk, all of the black high schools, he did all of the black weddings. He did the glamour shots before there were glamour shots. So people in Nashville used to say that one half of the family would take your picture and the other half would bury you. So when the building burned it lost a great deal of the history of the black families in Nashville, either from the pictures or the records of the family from death notices and funeral records. So we don't know really who my grandfather's, my paternal grandfather's parents were. My father would never talk about it and it was just something that was lost. So for him that's a complete dead end for my family.
Speaker 2: Now does it seem likely that it's a Gunter?
Speaker 1: It's, it--there are Gunters--
Speaker 2: Or Gunter, yeah.
Speaker 1: --G-U-N-T-E-R-S in Shelbyville and it was said that he had, was owner of a pencil factory or something but that's all hearsay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So it's completely, that's completely dropped for him.
Speaker 2: Okay. So he was never told or didn't know himself or--?
Speaker 1: You know it was--I tried to get my dad to talk about it. My dad was never comfortable talking about that. Remember I said my dad was quite conservative and provincial. When I was a kid growing up, my dad didn't want me to mop the floors or you know people laugh, I was 21 before I got to cross the street by myself. But, so it's just something that he never felt comfortable talking about. What I do know, I know from my aunt that died a year and a half ago who was 95 who was much more comfortable talking about it but she too knew very little.
Story_ID: 25877
Speaker 1: Now your father [Marcus Hutto Beanard Gunter], now he went to school at Tuskegee Institute.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And what did he major in?
Speaker 2: Music.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So my dad was a musician and he played with a jazz group known as the Melody Barons at Tuskegee. There's a lot of news media around that and his work with them. He, his mentor in music was Dawson, William Dawson who was the great negro spiritual composer and arranger out of Tuskegee. He was head of the music department.
Speaker 1: William Dawson.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: So he played with the Melody, what do they call--?
Speaker 2: The Melody Barons.
Speaker 1: Melody Barons, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he went to Julliard [The Julliard School of Performing Arts] and Chicago University doing continuing education in music. He was a warrant sergeant in the army assigned to Europe and the band and this was around, I guess around, excuse me, around--he graduated from college in 1939 so this was the early 40s [1940s]. He traveled around Europe and Northern Africa and was actually injured, his back was injured when he was in the army. He returned home and worked with a family business and also taught music at Pearl High School in Nashville, Tennessee which was right across the street from the funeral home and it's still there. It's now known as Martin Luther King, Jr. Magnet School in the sciences.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a famous high school in Nashville, right.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Story_ID: 25878
Speaker 1: Alright. Now is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: Not really. They were introduced. My mom [Pearl Kennedy] apparently was about 16. She had just gone to Fisk [University] and they were introduced by a family friend.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that was about, that's all that I know about that. I don't know anything about their courtship, anything like that except that when they got married, they were married I think in my mother's home in Marianna and my dad [Marcus Gunter] always says that the family made him stay way out someplace with another family friend. He couldn't stay too close at that time, but that's all that I know about, really about that.
Speaker 1: And what year were they married?
Speaker 2: They were married in 1950, 1949, maybe 1949.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright. Now when you think about your parents' personalities, their dispositions, their sense of humor, how they walk, talk, what they look like, what they're prone to do, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I think after both of them. I'm exactly the melding of those two spirits. My dad, I talked about him being rather provincial, conservative, he was very proper, people--but a funny guy, could tell stories. But you had to get to know him. My mother was a firecracker. She was a woman much before her time. She was the one doing the sit-ins that was going and sitting at the lunch counters in Tennessee as a college student and you know defying her parents. My dad would look at that kind of thing from afar so their personalities were about as different as you could see two people and I am literally in between those two personalities. So I'm an individual that I'm told takes care of business. I don't take any stuff. But I'm not the firecracker that my mother was and I am not as, at all as conservative as my dad, but probably a little more formal than my mother, right down the middle.
Speaker 1: Now how do you account for them being you know together in you know, the differences in personality?
Speaker 2: Well you know the truth be told, remember I talked--my mother wanted to get out of Marianna and I think that's one of the reasons she married young. That was the only way that you could kind of leave home at that time. My dad remember I said he liked younger women. My mother was a beau- was an absolutely gorgeous woman and I think my dad was attracted to that fiery personality and he had to learn how to deal with it. And my mother was attracted to the stability because she came from a very stable, home environment. So I think that that relationship provided them both with what they needed.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.
Speaker 2: Something I never asked one another, asked them. I should have asked them that but didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay. But you thought about it though.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 25879
Speaker 1: Now how many siblings do you have and can you name them and put yourself in the order?
Speaker 2: I am an only child.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that has you know helped to make me the person who I am because I'm an only child as the apple of my daddy's [Marcus Gunter] eye. And my parents believed in the power of education and the fact that each generation had to get better than the previous generation. The way through that was through the path to education. That's always a theme in my family. I grew up around adults so I was older you know at my ages because I was around adults quite a bit.
Speaker 1: Now did you have many cousins?
Speaker 2: I had cousins but I wasn't particularly close to them. My uncle Albert had two girls, one was older than I and the other was younger, but he and his wife divorced and they moved first to San Antonio [Texas] and then to Seattle [Washington]. So after about ten, I didn't have much contact with them. The closest thing that I have to a sister is my childhood friend who still lives in Nashville [Tennessee]. Our mothers were best friends when they were pregnant. We are three months apart in age. I'm the younger and that's the closest thing that I have to a sister. But I don't come from that large set of extended family with children my age. My extended family were all of my aunts and uncles who didn't have children and therefore I was everyone's child.
Speaker 1: Okay, and an accomplished group too at that.
Speaker 2: Very accomplished group.
Speaker 1: So all these college grads on your father's side and your mother's side now.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm. So when I went to, all through grade school and high school when I got out of school I spent all my time at the funeral home which was also the photography studio. So I either helped out you know as best I could with funeral things, talked to my aunt and uncles. And so that's what I mean by I was everyone's child and I was always around a lot of adults when I wasn't in school.
Speaker 1: Okay. So the household where you grew up consisted of your mother and father and you, is that basically--?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Until the, when I was--until the time I was 3 or 4, we lived in an apartment on top of the funeral home. Everyone in the family has lived in that apartment at one time or another. So we lived in one part of the apartment and my uncle lived in another part of the apartment so there were always people around. When I was around three or four we moved out to the suburbs but every morning I was dropped off at the funeral home and someone would take me to school and every afternoon someone would pick me up and drop me off at the funeral home until my mom would come pick me up or something like that and we would go home so I spent most of my time there. Funny kind of things that I went to--I was one of the ones to desegregate the catholic high school, catholic prep school. And I'm trying to imagine what he white girls really thought about because as a funeral director, we had lots of Cadillac's. And if my uncle was busy and couldn't pick me up, someone that worked with us would pick me up in the Cadillac. They would probably think I was being chauffeured. So I never thought about that about what they must have thought of all of that of someone coming to pick up you know Pamela in a big Cadillac driving her off to home.
Speaker 1: Yeah right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: It's interesting. So you were, this is kind of sort of an exciting--Pearl High School that everybody talks about if they were raised in Nashville, right across the street.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And here's the funeral home where the funeral home directors know everybody and then you got an uncle who's a photographer who's shooting everybody's picture in the black community.
Speaker 2: Right. Right.
Speaker 1: That's really got to be an exciting place to hang out?
Speaker 2: It was very rich but the side of me that was my mother, it was too confining. I wanted to be someplace where no one knew who I was because I couldn't go anywhere, do anything even if I moved outside of the African American community, everyone in town knew me because of my family.
Story_ID: 25880
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: The earliest childhood memory that I have was a traumatic one was, the funeral--the apartment was up a very steep, long flight of steps, probably I don't know 15 steps and I remember fall--tumbling down to the bottom of them when I was probably about three. That's the earliest memory that I have. It's funny that, I guess it was very traumatic but I have other, lots of memories of you know working around you know deceased and bodies and things like that because I had, that's how I had my anatomy lessons when I was a kid.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this--I would think that this demystified you know the body and death and--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Yeah. I think it would have to. So well, tell us about--since we're on the subject yeah tell us about that, you know what the--
Speaker 2: Growing up around a funeral home or--?
Speaker 1: Yeah, you said you had your first lessons in anatomy.
Speaker 2: So I was always you know there. We, and we always had cases when I was there many evenings. And it was generally in the evenings that they would embalm the bodies. And I re--my dad never had the stomach for it. He was actually the business manager for the place. My uncle who was the photographer was the artist and so if there was a, an accident, he would do all the make-up and the facial restoration. And my other uncle was the gregarious one. He was the one that was out in the public and waving and going around. But one of the memories I have is that we had had a case that was--and I was probably about five, a case that was a, had been opt, opt--I can't--blanking on the word, had an autopsy. It's not right but--and I remember my uncle calling me into the morgue and standing up on a stool and he lifts the top of the skull and then starts to explain to me where the brain stem goes down and all of that. And I was always very fascinated by human anatomy because, I guess because I had those kind of lessons. Little, sounds a little strange now but you know it was just what happened.
Speaker 1: Yeah. And it doesn't--so many people are superstitious and afraid, especially in those days. The further back you get it seems that there's more like fear and spookiness attached to a funeral home and the funeral process and death and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: But I grew up there. I was there every afternoon, every morning. And the, for the photography business where they actually developed the films, the lab, you had to go through the morgue to get upstairs to where the lab was. So you would have to walk through there. I would have to carry things back and forth and they would be doing whatever they were doing.
Speaker 1: Now did you do any photography as a youth?
Speaker 2: I didn't. I didn't do any of that but I have a son who's a photographer.
Speaker 1: Okay. So he kind of took after your uncle in that regard.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Story_ID: 25881
Speaker 1: Now you said you had a best friend that's still a good friend of yours now.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: So you had somebody to play with and hang out with even though--?
Speaker 2: I did sometimes after school because her mother and my mother [Pearl Kennedy] were best friends. We would stop by and I went to school with the same group of kids for most of my elementary and secondary school. So you know I had that type of childhood but I didn't have the give and take that you normally have with siblings. And we lived out in the suburbs so there wasn't like you know during those days it was a lot of space so it wasn't like you had you know that you just on your own visiting houses. And most of the kids my age in the neighborhood were boys anyhow so you know it's how I grew up.
Speaker 1: Well tell me this now what did they call the neighborhood around Pearl High School and around--?
Speaker 2: That's North Nashville.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's North Nashville?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And how old were you when the family moved?
Speaker 2: From the funeral home I was about three.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Three, four.
Speaker 1: But you still had a lot of contact with the funeral home kind of afterschool and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Oh I was there everyday. I was there everyday. Sometimes--cause my mom would teach some classes in the evening. She would pick, come to pick me up and the family would go to the--we would go have dinner. You know Nashville because of all the colleges there, you had Fisk [University], you had Meharry [Medical College], you had Tennessee State [University], had a strong black middle class infrastructure. There were a lot of professionals. And so quite frankly I never thought about segregation because we had our own movie theater. I never sat in the balcony. We went to the Ritz Theater on Jefferson Street.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Jefferson Street was the main drag in black Nashville.
Speaker 2: It was the main drag, right. We had our own restaurants. We had our own hotels. I do remember as a kid that if we traveled outside of Nashville it was difficult to find a place to stay. You would always stay with friends. Generally we stayed with friends of my dad, other people who were in the funeral business. So it was a very rich environment in which, for a person of color, the African American community if you were in the middle class was very comfortable.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was the name of the neighborhood your family moved to in--?
Speaker 2: Haynes Heights.
Story_ID: 25882
Speaker 1: Where did you start school?
Speaker 2: So I went to St. Vincent School for grades 5 through 8th except for when I went to live with my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay. So that's the first--that's grades 5 through 8, right?
Speaker 2: No, kindergarten.
Speaker 1: Oh age 5 through 8, okay.
Speaker 2: Kindergarten through grade 8.
Speaker 1: Okay, K through 8, okay.
Speaker 2: And during those days in the segregated south the catholic schools, parochial schools were the private schools.
Speaker 1: Right. So what was it like? What was St. Vincent--did you like school?
Speaker 2: I loved school. St. Vincent was a great school and I literally went to school with the same group. You know it was, we had one class of, per grade and I went to school with the same kids up through 8th grade so it was a very small community and I loved school. It was a great school.
Speaker 1: Okay. So this was like an all black catholic school?
Speaker 2: Yes. This is during the time of segregation still.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Were the teachers nuns or--?
Speaker 2: There were a few lay teachers, not many. Most of the teachers were nuns.
Speaker 1: Okay, and they were white I would guess?
Speaker 2: They were white, right. And maybe I had two lay teachers who were black.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: Always liked the sciences so I would say science was one of my favorite subjects.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Also liked languages and I liked French and I took French even at St. Vincent probably in like the 7th grade, 8th grade. I also played because my dad was a musician I played an instrument. I went to Peabody Conservatory of Music.
Speaker 1: So what did you play?
Speaker 2: I, well I started off playing the violin. That was my dad's thing for me to play the violin. I dropped the violin as soon as I could and I played the piano.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I still play.
Speaker 1: And you went to the Peabody Conservatory?
Speaker 2: Of Music, um-hmm, in high school also in Nashville.
Speaker 1: Now did you consider becoming a professional musician?
Speaker 2: No. No, never. I, unfortunately I'm fairly tone deaf so I read music, I play what I read but improvise, no I can't do that so--and you have to be able to do that a bit.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright. Well classical you don't seem to have to do that that much and--
Speaker 2: Well you know if I can, if it's written down I can read it. I have that good eye-hand coordination. I have long fingers. I can play it but I'm not the person to go and just start playing something at the party.
Speaker 1: Okay. So did you have any favorite teachers in grade school?
Speaker 2: I guess the one that I remember because I remember an incident that happened was my first grade teacher, Sister Noberta [ph]. And one of the reasons I remember that was that my girlfriend in Nashville, we were--I was over her house one Saturday and we decided at that very young age to walk to St. Vincent. It was probably four blocks away and we went to the nunnery to visit Sister Noberta, ended up spending a couple of hours. By the time we got back home it was not, they were not happy with us. So if you can imagine you know what seven, seven years old or something going off walking by yourself four blocks, no one knows where you are, not a good idea.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.
Speaker 2: And there were some teachers that were just mean, several of, just angry, mean people. So those I won't talk about but--
Speaker 1: There's a lot of catholic nun stories about the ruler and all that.
Speaker 2: Oh, you talk about discipline, absolutely. But I think that you learn some things from that. You learned how to manage your time, how to conduct yourself, that type of thing. They did not tolerate--there were no obedience problems in school like you have now.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now who are some of your fellow students? You said you went to school with the same group. Now who is your best friend and who were some of the other students?
Speaker 2: So my best friend who's still my best friend, very much like a sister is Rhonda Harris. She is a social worker, works with veterans and we're still very close. Debra Mitchell was another good friend. She actually joined the Coast Guard and was a lawyer for the Coast Guard. Another one was Quinta Martin who lived in the neighborhood. So I remember a good you know 12 individual names of individuals from there, from that time.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now--
Speaker 2: There were about maybe 20 of us in a class, no more than 24.
Speaker 1: So you were there I guess through 1964 or 5 [1965] or so?
Speaker 2: Sixty-five.
Speaker 1: Sixty-five, okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 25883
Speaker 1: And so you were in grade school when Freedom Rides were going on and--which was centered out of Nashville [Tennessee]. And did your parents talk about all the civil rights activity in Nashville?
Speaker 2: Actually my parents didn't. I lived in a bubble. My mother told me later that she and my father--she had made the decision that I would not be raised with the legacy of segregation and racial tensions. In my family we have all colors of people. We have people who are very, very fair, pass for white. We have people who are many, many shades darker. I have friends who are all shades and so I was essentially raised color blind. When I would talk about going to--I remember there was--we would go shopping in Nashville and we would want to stop and have lunch at Harvey's was the big department store. It was never, I was never told that black people didn't go there. It was oh well we don't have time to do that. Maybe we'll go someplace else. So whether it's right or wrong, my parents decided to raise me in that way. Now we knew, I guess in some respect I knew what was going on but not in great detail because in Nashville I don't know--there was a lawyer by--a civil rights lawyer by the name of Looby [Zephaniah Alexander Looby] and Attorney Looby was married to my mother's aunt, Grafta [ph.]. And so their house was bombed, I certainly remember that. I remember all of what was going on during that time but I don't remember sit-ins and things like that. And again you could live in a bubble in the African American community in Nashville at that time. So it was something that was not that much of a conversation that I remember at the dinner table.
Speaker 1: Okay. So--
Speaker 2: A little unusual.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Looby was really a big, heroic figure in the civil rights movement.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: I hear his name a lot.
Speaker 2: And you know there were others in Nashville. And as I said he was married to my mother's, it was a cousin. I remember when their house was bombed. I remember when he was active but I didn't really--you know how you go through life, you don't understand the significance of things sometimes when you're a kid. So I, you know it was just something that I knew about but didn't factor into my daily life.
Speaker 1: Now some other events I guess that happened when you were in grade school would have been like the assassination of John Kennedy [John Fitzgerald "Jack" Kennedy, 35th President of the United States] and--
Speaker 2: Oh I certainly remember that. That was a really big, big deal. I actually have a scrapbook that I made of that when I was a kid. Going to a catholic school I remember the day that he was shot and I was on the playground at school at St. Vincent so I certainly recall that. I certainly recall Martin Luther King [Jr.] [Clergyman, activist, civil rights leader]. By that time I was older. I was already in high school, all of that. So I certainly recall that. But if you ask me about living the day to day life in the segregated south you know I was pretty much in a bubble because of the community that I lived in.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25884
Speaker 1: So you were taking piano lessons and did you like popular culture music growing up in kind of--?
Speaker 2: Oh of course I did.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: And I liked that and that was during the time of, I was a big, also a big Jimmy Hendrix [James Marshall Hendrix (born Johnny Allen Hendrix), former American guitarist] fan later when, by the time I got to college. But oh I had a, we had all types of music in my home from classical and of course my dad's symphonic band played all types of music and you know to James Brown [James Joseph Brown, Jr., former recording artist, musician and "The Godfather of Soul"], Sarah Vaughn [Sarah Lois Vaughan, former American jazz singer] all of those folks you know were what we listened to at home when I was a kid.
Speaker 1: Did you have a lot of live shows in Nashville when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: I don't remember a lot of live shows. Nashville had a nightclub scene and I do recall my parents going to some of those clubs. The New Era is one. I just happened to remember that name. But as a kid I didn't go and I left Nashville when I was 17 so I've never had an adult life in Nashville.
Speaker 1: Okay. So now, well in high school now you go to a catholic high school too?
Speaker 2: So I went to a catholic high school. I went to St. Bernard Academy starting in 9th grade. I was in the second class that they accepted African Americans, all girls. The first year that they desegregated they took in four. The second year there were six of us that went there and again these were for the most part, outside of about two people that I had gone to school with since first grade who were the African American kids.
Story_ID: 25885
Speaker 1: We were just talking off camera about some of the other personalities in Nashville [Tennessee] and you were talking about Attorney [Zephaniah Alexander] Looby being from the Caribbean, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And a striking kind of a person.
Speaker 2: And I remember you know sitting in the living room talking with him and as I say I remember when their house was bombed. Dr. Vivien [Theodore] Thomas was a family friend, the physician.
Speaker 1: This is a heart surgeon from Johns Hopkins--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --who they made the movie about.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That starred, Mos Def [Yasiin Bey] I think played him.
Speaker 2: Yes, and my dad provided some of the background material for that. So there were all types of people. Bill Dawson that was the composer, I used to have cupcakes in his kitchen. So it was just, it was a very rich time in the community, a lot of people around that I grew up with.
Speaker 1: Now Vivien Thomas, he was associated with Johns Hopkins where he designed these surgical instruments and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and advised the surgeon that won the awards--
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: --for the things that he showed him how to do.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: But he was also based in Nashville at one time before he went there.
Speaker 1: I didn't realize that. So--
Speaker 2: My dad knew him.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.
Speaker 2: So my dad knew all of these--
Speaker 1: So he's a friend of your, a personal friend of your father's who--?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, of my father's.
Speaker 1: Okay. And so he'd come in to visit--
Speaker 2: He--my dad. I barely remember him but my dad knew all of these people form Nashville and of course you had Meharry [Medical College] so you had all types of people you know coming in and out of town and visiting.
Speaker 1: Yeah, lots of doctors. So many black doctors got their degrees from Meharry.
Speaker 2: Exactly and educators. So I remember Lawson [Dr. James Raymond Lawson, eighth president of Fisk University] who was the president of Fisk when I was a kid being there and it was just all types of people coming in and out.
Speaker 1: Let's see, I know, I don't know if it's the same one, the Reverend James Lawson, the civil rights--did your father know him?
Speaker 2: I--he may have.
Speaker 1: I think he was at the seminary. I don't think it's the same one.
Speaker 2: May not. No, this one was the president of Fisk during the time I was in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay. You also had Tennessee State [University], Fisk U--
Speaker 2: Tennessee State, right.
Speaker 1: --a couple of theological seminaries and--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --the home of the AME [African Methodist Episcopal] Church there.
Speaker 2: Right. My father's sister married Thomas Jarrett who was president of Atlanta University in Atlanta and there, and his brother Jarrett wrote for the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] Crisis, the magazine. He was the editor of the magazine. So there were all types of intellectual and folks that I interacted with that I had no idea really who they were or their importance.
Speaker 1: Okay. But these are good people to talk to. These are all very accomplished, very smart people and so you're the little kid talking to all these--
Speaker 2: And remember I said that a lot, I spent a lot of my time with adults so yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25886
Speaker 1: Okay. Now was church a factor in growing up at all?
Speaker 2: Not really. I went to catholic school for twelve years so I went to church everyday at noon with the catholic mass although I was not catholic. My dad belonged to Clark Memorial United Methodist Church. His father was very instrumental in the founding of that church. My mother belonged to Holy Trinity Episcopal Church in South Nashville. So one Sunday we would go to Clark and the next Sunday we would go to Holy Trinity. Clark was much more conservative than Holy Trinity because the pastor of Holy Trinity was also the chaplain at Fisk [University] so he was very involved with the students during the, during that time. But in terms of you know we went to church but having our life centered around church as it is for some African American families that's not quite my experience.
Speaker 1: Okay. So you didn't spend hours on Sunday or Wednesday--?
Speaker 2: No, no. We went at 11, you got out at 12, 12:15. And then the routine was to go buy flowers and go get something to eat and go home. No, we did not have the two, three hour services.
Speaker 1: Not going back in the afternoon for--
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no.
Speaker 1: --BTU and fried chicken and all that?
Speaker 2: That did not happen.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright, so a different kind of experience there.
Story_ID: 25887
Speaker 1: So okay, so in high school now St. Bernard Academy, now was this integration process I mean how was this for you? Nashville has just integrated I guess and--but you were kind of raised in kind of a cloistered setting anyway. I mean did you, I mean how did you--what were your encounters like with the white students?
Speaker 2: So you know I would say it was not the time of integration because it was the time of desegregation. They're different, okay.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: It was the time of desegregation and so that means that you are the first and you're going through all of the hoops that you have to go through to get in. You have to be tested you know. The others didn't have to be tested but that said it was very easy. There wasn't--I didn't encounter really any problems, my friends and I didn't. We did not socialize very much with the white students. Again we had you know our own social kind of a group that we had had when we were at St. Vincent's and we pretty much stayed in that unless it was for school activities. So they're people that I knew and socialized at school but not very much outside of school.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now did you in high school see yourself as becoming a scientist?
Speaker 2: Yes. So I knew when I was five I wanted to be a scientist.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's all I ever wanted to do. I never wanted to be a physician, not anything I aspired to, to my family's--let's just say they were not happy about that. But the high school I went to had two tracks, one I'm going to call the mommy track and the other was the college prep track. The mommy track was for those who were going to get married right out of high school. It was, this was a catholic high school in the south, very typical about--so they took typing and shorthand and cooking and those types of things. The college prep on the other hand took four years of Latin, four years of French. I took biology, chemistry, biochemistry, physiology. So I had a very rich background in the sciences in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay. I just, I want to go back to when you were five in a sec, in just a second. This is when you decided you were going to be a scientist.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And how did you make that decision and what was it that happened or what revelation happened that made you--?
Speaker 2: Well remember I was always around you know bodies being embalmed and things like that so I was fascinated by that. The other thing was that I was always trying to take things apart and put them back together so I remember my mother would get very upset with me when I would play tea with my dolls or what have you. I was always taking objects and shaving them down or cutting them down to resemble new types of food. All of my Christmas toys came unassembled. I thought everyone's toys came unassembled so it was just never a question as to whether or not I was going to go into the sciences. There was one time there was a thought that maybe I would be a physician but that really wasn't my calling so I never, I've never wanted to be anything else other than that.
Speaker 1: Now did you have any examples of a scientist that you--?
Speaker 2: Actually outside of my family and my uncles in the funeral home, not really because it wasn't something that woman did and it wasn't anything that people of color did in that--I mean you could be, what would you be? You'd be a doctor, a lawyer or a teacher but not a scientist.
Speaker 1: So you didn't have any real examples but did you have any in the media, in the movies or books or something that you admired or--?
Speaker 2: I don't, you know I don't recall. Now certainly when I got to college I did and I have you know some examples of that. But before college, not that I recall that I can report, point to any one person. Even in the photography business my aunt and uncle were always dealing with chemicals, how they interact. They hand painted portraits and so you had to get the tints right and that's a lot of chemistry involved in that. So that's what I attribute it to.
Speaker 1: And when you were growing up I guess as a teenager on television there are doctors--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --dramas were popular, Ben Casey--
Speaker 2: Right, sure.
Speaker 1: --Dr. Kildare and all that sort of thing. Did you--?
Speaker 2: Sure, I watched those but I don't recall much of that until I got to college. When I got to college my roommates and I would play games with Dr. Kildare or Dr. Welby, MD. So we would turn to the TV on at the beginning and then we would turn it off in the middle, make our diagnosis and then turn it back on to see if we were right. But certainly not in high school, but we did that in college.
Speaker 1: That's interesting. I've never heard of anybody doing that--
Speaker 2: Well we did--right.
Speaker 1: But that's a good, that seems like it would be a lot of fun.
Speaker 2: It was a lot of fun.
Story_ID: 25888
Speaker 1: Okay, so in high school now did you--were you a leader in high school? Did you run for any class offices or--?
Speaker 2: So in high school I was the president of my high school sorority. High schools at that time had sororities and fraternities. My high school sorority was based out of Pearl High. It was called the Subdebs. There were two. And the--
Speaker 1: Subdebs.
Speaker 2: The Subdebs.
Speaker 1: Now what did that mean?
Speaker 2: Well it was run like a sorority in high school and everyone except for the girls that went to catholic school went to Pearl High and there, I've forgotten the name of the other one but we had a line and we had to go through probation and all of those--show up at the foot--so my, so a lot of my social life still revolved around Pearl High and that social group that I had from St. Vincent. So I was the president of that. I was very active in girl scouts. I was a senior Girl Scout leader and I actually was a camp counselor in the summertime and was actually the one to desegregate some of the camps. I was a swimmer and went to aquatic camp for two years when I was in high school and that was, I was the only camper of color so I kind of--that was interesting. That's when I really started understanding the depth of segregation and what that meant. But--so I belonged to that sorority. I went to dances that they had at my school to the prom and to dances that were put on by the fraternities and the sororities in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So was I a leader? Somewhat, but I belonged to the honor society, the writing honor society. I won as a senior in high school, the Veteran's Day Essay Contest and got to ride in the parade on a float and give a speech to the assembled dignitaries in Nashville. So I guess you would say that I was.
Speaker 1: Okay, that sounds like enough to make you--
Speaker 2: Enough to say, to count. Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25889
Speaker 1: So when you were a senior in high school then what was your counseling like in terms of school? Did they give you good counseling at St. Bernard?
Speaker 2: Remember what I said about my mother. My mother knew exactly what she wanted and what she thought was important. So in terms of counseling in high school I don't recall counseling in the way in which we do it now for students. It was during the time still of desegregation, maybe about three or four years. A lot of family like mine, were sending their kids to schools in the north to white schools that were now accepting black students. Some had been doing it for many, many years like Oberlin, Colby, those schools. My mother made the decision that I was going to go to a HBCU [Historically Black Colleges and Universities], and it was done for a number of reasons. One, remember I said I lived in the bubble, in a very sheltered life. My dad taught at the high school. He taught most of the nice boys and they were too frightened of him to ever date me. And I had gone to a white high school, all girls' school so my interactions were very narrow. My mom thought it was very important that I learn what it meant to be a black woman and that I form those networks. So when people were talking about going other places, my choices were between Hampton [University], Howard [University], Spelman [College] and Fisk [University].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Fisk was in Nashville [Tennessee]--
Speaker 1: So that put a lid--
Speaker 2: --that took that out--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --okay. Howard was in Washington, D.C., which was in my dad's words, a fast city, too fast for his daughter that wasn't allowed to cross the street by herself. Hampton was my grandmother's school was in the running. Spelman I visited and fell in love with and my aunt and uncle lived in Atlanta [Georgia]. I went to Spelman who also gave me a full tuition scholarship.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.
Speaker 2: Had nothing to do that it was an all girls' school, of course being across the street from Morehouse [College]. It is--it doesn't feel that way but I was there one Thanksgiving and ran into the chair of the biology department who showed me around and showed me the electron microscope and that I would have a chance to work with him, and I was sold on Spelman.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now who was the chair of the biology department?
Speaker 2: His name was Barnard Smith.
Speaker 1: Barnard Smith, okay.
Speaker 2: And at Spelman, unlike many of the HBCUs that you have today, the faculty in the sciences were all black so you had excellent role models that could you know if you wanted to be a scientist you had wonderful role models there, not many women but Audrey Manley came later. So you had a lot of role models for that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is 19, you graduated--?
Speaker 2: This is 1969.
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty nine.
Speaker 2: And I graduated in 1973.
Story_ID: 25890
Speaker 1: Okay. So your high school graduation was also in 1969 right?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you started in the fall of '69 [1969]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --at Spelman [College] and so this is the year after Dr. King [Martin Luther King Jr.] is assassinated in Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 2: Um-hmm. And I remember that, I was in high school. I remember I was sitting in class. I remember exactly when it was announced and it was just gut wrenching. And sitting in the class with few students of color, maybe four and everyone else white, they all were like what does this mean, what next? It was like people were speechless. They didn't know what to say.
Speaker 1: It happened right there in Tennessee and also--I mean did the school stop classes or did it mark the occasion with anything special, a moment of silence or--
Speaker 2: I think it was a moment of silence but that was about it. People were scared about the aftermath. People didn't know what to think. I remember my mom and dad going to meetings of--in the homes of some Nashville white professionals, especially physicians to talk about race relations, that type of thing during that time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know the assassination triggered a lot of discussion--
Speaker 2: It certainly did.
Speaker 1: --and a lot of reordering of things and provided on some level a lot of opportunities you know in a number of different ways for people.
Speaker 2: I remember feeling wounded, betrayed. He was--it was a very difficult time. I remember that as being, you know as being a high school student the difficult time that it was.
Speaker 1: Okay. Were there memorial services that your family attended or--?
Speaker 2: Yes, family attended memorial services. There were things that were done in town. I don't remember anything that was done at the high school per se, but it certainly was a major thing that happened in our community, everywhere.
Story_ID: 25891
Speaker 1: Okay, alright. So Spelman College 1969, so are you a biology major?
Speaker 2: So I'm a biology major, away from home for the first time really, 17 years old in the big city of Atlanta, Georgia but about six blocks from the president's house of Atlanta University where my uncle and my aunt lived. He was Thomas Jarrett and she was Anna Bell Gunter. So I was being supervised but not being supervised so to speak. This was also during the time of afros and what have you. My mother talks, had talked about how she dropped me off at school with all these nice clothes and I was a little girl counting pig tails and what have you. By the time I came home for Christmas I had figured out how to make my hair into a big afro, was wearing you know army shirts and things like that. So it was an era during that time when everyone was very, very proud to be black. That was the "I'm black and I'm proud" era.
Speaker 1: Who came to campus? Did you have any major speakers in those days or (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Oh all types of people came to campus, Nikki Giovanni, all types of dignitaries came, ambassadors to speak on campus. We had, every day at noon we had a convocation, they called it chapel where they would bring in various speakers and of course we had wonderful speakers on our own campus and also in and around Atlanta who came during that time, all types of performers. It was a very, very rich time. The president of Spelman at the time was Albert Manley.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He was a widower and he married Audrey Forbes Manley who became first lady when I was about a sophomore or junior at Spelman. And to have a woman of color scientist and a physician on our campus, those of us who were biology students, especially my two roommates and I grew very close to her and she became a marvelous role model for us. That was what was so special about Spelman that you had people who looked like you, who were like you and no one ever told you that you shouldn't want to be a scientist because you were a female and black. It was never a part of the discussion. It was always about how you were going to get there. And there were lots of people who came before you who were willing to help you do that.
Speaker 1: Okay. So tell us about Audrey Forbes Manley. Now she had a degree in biology as well?
Speaker 2: She had a--she was a graduate of Spelman. She had a degree in biology. I believe that she went to Meharry [Medical College], I'm not sure. She either went to Meharry or to Howard [University]. And her field was endocrinology if I recall and she still did work for the public health service. But she came on campus and remember it was during the time that there had not been a first lady on campus during the time that I had been there. My roommates and I who are both physicians now were kind of like the darlings of the campus. So we would put on the white gloves and serve tea and things like that at Spelman back when we were students. We were a little naughty too but they never knew that part about us. So--
Speaker 1: Okay. I can't imagine any college girls being naughty.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. We were a little naughty but we survived all of that and I'll leave that there, you know. It was during the early 70s [1970s] so--
Speaker 1: But you became you know you were saying you actually became like friends with Dr. Manley and she would actually talk to you all and give you advice.
Speaker 2: Oh well not you know, not friends.
Speaker 1: Well not, yeah I--
Speaker 2: You know what I mean? It was more like--
Speaker 1: Mentor.
Speaker 2: --a big sister somewhat. Till this day I remember maybe ten years ago she said Pamela call me Audrey. And I said Dr. Manley I cannot call you Audrey and so we have settled on that. But she was really an inspiration to have a female physician and scientist because at the time she was still doing some work in endocrinology there and she took us up under her wing. But a lot of people did during that time.
Story_ID: 25892
Speaker 1: Oh I've forgotten his name but the college physician who was well known in Nashville [Tennessee] used to take me and my two roommates, he was a surgeon, into surgery with him. And so we would go into surgery and work with--you know see what he was doing and he would instruct us. So there were a lot of people that had helped to promote that, to give us those types of experiences. His name was--his name, last name was Clinton, fairly well known in Atlanta [Georgia]. No, Clint Warner, Clint Warner was his name.
Speaker 2: Warner, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, so he would let you all go to surgery with him?
Speaker 1: Yes. Yes, and so my two roommates are both physicians and he would take us into surgery with him and while they were going oh, wow this is great, I'm like okay, let's move on this is boring. Let's move on. But yeah he would. He would you know ask the patients, they would say okay and we would go into surgery with him.
Speaker 2: That's something, oh okay. So you're getting a pretty I mean a real first hand--
Speaker 1: I'm a very much--
Speaker 2: --in-depth--?
Speaker 1: --in-depth training. I stayed in Atlanta during the summer working with Bill LeFlore [ph.] who was also a faculty member and Bernard Smith on their research project. We had just gotten funding from the NIH [National Institutes of Health] to promote minority scientists, student scientists. Between my junior and my senior year, I actually went to Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory [private nonprofit marine and biological exploration research facility] which most students didn't do until they were graduate students or post-docs and that door was open for me by Bill LeFlore who himself two years earlier had gotten a fellowship to go do that. So I, you know I have a lot of people who have made the right doors and opportunities open for me. You don't get to where you are by yourself. A lot of experiences count towards that.
Speaker 2: Okay. Now was there a certain part of biology that you focused on in terms of--?
Speaker 1: Well there are a couple. One is that Bill Leflore taught comparative anatomy. It was the hurdle that you had to pass if you were going to graduate as a biology major. By the time we got to his class, we started out with a class of 40 biology majors. We had been whittled down to 12 and by the time we got down with--done with his class there were six of us left. You would do all different types of dissections of different types of preserved specimens and my roommates just wanted to get done, I enjoyed the process. So mine were always perfect and mine were the ones they would use for the exams. There was one time when we weren't quite ready for the exam so we decided that we would steal all of the animals and take them to the dormitory that we had dissected out. So we took the animals out of the labs so that we were going to--you know the security guards would open up the labs for us. We took it to the dorm thinking that we couldn't have the test the next day. Well his figuring out that the animals, the specimens were gone, he had quickly dissected something, they looked awful, they looked like cheese. You couldn't figure out anything. He had put pins in it and he never said a word, he just went on with it. That was you know how that was. So you know I remember that. The other thing that I remember was that the William Townsend Porter Foundation of which I am now on the board of directors, sponsored a class with the Emory University School of Medicine in physiology that was taught at Spelman. It was a senior level course. And there was the only African American female physiologist that I knew at the time. Her name was Eleanor Eisen Franklin, she was a Spelman alum. She was on the physiology faculty at Howard University School of Medicine and she was one of the people that came in to teach the course. And that was a wonderful course because it was essentially what the medical students had, first year medical students had at Emory.
Story_ID: 25893
Speaker 1: Alright. You had mentioned Jimmy Hendrix before and this is the era for Jimmy Hendrix. So were you introduced to Hendrix in high school or what?
Speaker 2: Oh that was really in college so Santana, Jimmy Hendrix, that was also during the time of Michael Jackson and the Jackson Five and going to parties and having that. I remember going to concerts and things like that when I was a college student.
Speaker 1: Okay. The Atlanta Underground was a big deal.
Speaker 2: It was a big deal during then but you know it, Atlanta Underground, there were a couple of clubs that you could go to but we did more kind of house parties type of things. Of course the drinking age had been lowered to 18 when I was in college so you could go to clubs and what have you but there was still a lot of the black clubs that we would go to on Auburn Avenue. There was one I remember called the Royal Peacock which is a famous old club of Auburn Avenue, kind of across from the Auburn Market. Sweet Auburn Avenue.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Auburn Avenue, that's right.
Speaker 2: But we didn't do much of that. Most of our activities were house parties and things like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25894
Speaker 1: So when you were heading towards graduation, I was asking you what your--so you went to Woods Hole [Marine Biology Laboratory] twice.
Speaker 2: So I went to Woods Hole once, the summer between--
Speaker 1: Just once?
Speaker 2: Just once.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: --the summer between my junior and senior year. It was a wonderful, wonderful experience because it was science 24 hours a day. The library stayed open 24 hours a day so at 2 o'clock in the morning I would go back up in the stacks and read some of the original literature or the translation of the original literature. I would sit down and have lunch with Nobel Prize winners. It was just great. Labs were open 24 hours a day. The main event at the time, there were two main events. One was during a certain week you could see all of the bioluminescence that was in the bay so everyone would go down to the bay in swimsuits and see all the bioluminescence in the water. And the other big annual summer event was the mating of the squid and we would all go out to watch the squid mate.
Speaker 1: Now was the squid in captivity?
Speaker 2: These were in captivity.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But those were the kind of the two rites of passage if you will for the Woods Hole summer group. But it was just a rich environment to be with scientists of that caliber.
Speaker 1: Okay. Who were some of the scientists that you met? Do you remember?
Speaker 2: What I remember is Albert Szent-Gyorgyi [Albert Szent-Gyorgyi de Nagyrapolt, Hungarian physiologist].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I remember having, sitting down at the lunch table with him and there were others that I remember. I can't remember all of their names but that's the one that I really remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25895
Speaker 1: So when you--now you went to grad school at Emory [University]. Now tell us how that was, how you made that hook up and what--
Speaker 2: So remember that I want--well first I wanted to stay in Atlanta [Georgia]. Second, remember that I said that Emory had gotten money for this physiology course and some of those professors from the medical school at Emory had taught in that course at Spelman [College] so they knew me as a student. So when it was time for me to go to graduate school I was interested in medical sciences but never wanted to be a physician. I approached that group in terms of, for graduate admissions. They took me but they never really believed that I would make it, that I would finish. It was, I remember when I went to interview they were asking me what I was interested in and I was a little naive at that time. But I remember that one of the female faculty members said to me well I'm not sure that this is the best place for you or this is the place for you. And I remember her saying well if I don't go to school here, I will go to school someplace else. So they did accept me but they gave me no money. So I could come when they normally would fund graduate students but they weren't going to give me any money and it was almost as if I was always on probation, always on probation always having to prove myself.
Speaker 1: Were your grades good at--from Spelman?
Speaker 2: My grades were excellent for Spelman but my GRE [Graduate Record Examinations] scores were not good.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I've never been good test taker. So my GRE scores were relatively low but my grades were excellent and my recommendations were excellent. You know also I would just say at Spelman when you got to be a senior, you were taking courses at the graduate school anyhow so I had already had some of those courses. But the--they didn't give me any money but the Porter Foundation gave me money and they vested in me. They paid my, and they paid my tuition. And the other place that I got money was from the Smith Kline & French at that time. They, there was an African American male scientist that worked at Smith Kline that I remember meeting when I was a senior. And he, I remember him saying the era of the black male is over. It is now the era of the black female. So he was very interested in providing minority scientists for the pharmaceutical industry and they provided money for me. So it was through fellowships from Smith Kline and the William Porter Towns--William Townsend Porter Foundation that I was able to get money to go to school. And my parents of course helped me as well.
Story_ID: 25896
Speaker 1: Okay. Now Emory University is supposed to be a well-endowed university with a lot of important, I mean they probably had all the equipment and all the latest everything, I guess.
Speaker 2: Oh it was a, it was terrific. I was trained as a classical physiologist. The first two years you essentially go to medical school and then when the medical students start doing the clinics then you start your research. And my friends at Emory outside of the few graduate students, I was the only student, graduate student of color in my department, were the medical students, school students. And so there were in my classes, there were one--there were four students of color. Again, this was during the time that Emory was still desegregating. They were beginning to integrate at that time. So those became my friends and colleagues when, that I was taking classes with. And we learned very quickly how to integrate ourselves into that system because one of the things you would learn at a place like Spelman is that it's most of the white students who have all the tools that you need that will be helpful to you like class notes, former exams. You have to learn how to integrate yourself into that so that you have the advantage that all of them have and so we did that. But those became my friends and we're still friends till this day.
Speaker 1: Okay. So you took the course of study of a medical student for two years first.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And then how--where did it go?
Speaker 2: And then after my second year I started doing--even in my second year I started taking some specialized courses and that was when I really impressed some of the instructors in the department because I never will forget, I was taking a class on membrane biophysics. And the faculty member asked a question, there were maybe about eight of us in the class and I was the only one who knew the answer because I always, I never considered myself to be smart. I think I, I'm an intelligent person but I've always worked very hard. I've always had this fear of lack of anything else, failure and always knew that I had to be prepared and I always had to be a bit better to prove myself when I walked into any room. So I had started taking classes then and then--a few classes. And then when the medical students started doing their clinical rotations then I started doing my research. And I was matched with at that time a new faculty member at Emory in the school who was supposed to kind of help mentor me and I ended up staying in his lab because the field that I went in which involves membrane biophysics is not the branch of physiology, is not one that had a lot of women in it anyhow. Most women went into cardiovascular or endocrinology, they didn't go into the branch of membrane ion transport that you needed to know a lot of physics, a lot of math, tend to scare people away. But that's where I ended up you know being. By that time Emory had started to invest in me an gave me a scholarship but the Porter Foundation continued to support me with stipends during my time when I went to school. I am very indebted to them because I would not have gone at least to Emory without their assistance.
Speaker 1: Okay. Well who would you consider to be--well what you had an advisor for your Ph.D., right?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And did you consider just getting a masters degree and then stopping or ever--?
Speaker 2: No one got a Masters. You only got a Ph.D. because there was nothing you could do with a Masters. So the only people who got a masters, they gave terminal masters. That was if in fact they had decided that you were not going to make it through the Ph.D. program. The year that I went into the program there were four or five of us that--it was always a small program that was admitted and two of the five ended up getting terminal degrees.
Speaker 1: So the masters is like a consolation prize or something or--?
Speaker 2: It was a consolation prize because--
Speaker 1: Because you couldn't--
Speaker 2: --you couldn't be a faculty member or work in a--you wouldn't have that type of career with a masters in the sciences. And quite frankly unless you're going to go into pharmaceuticals or biotechnology and have a kind of more of a technical job, you really need a doctorate if you're going to be in the field. It's the passport. So there was--so I never got a Masters. I was never--I guess the equivalent would be once you took your comprehensive exams which covered all of two years of studies, it was a day of writing and a--a week of writing and an oral exam. You passed that then you knew that eventually if you just stuck with it you'd get your Ph.D. If not, you'd get a terminal masters.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so no masters.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Story_ID: 25897
Speaker 1: So going straight through, now who was your Ph.D. advisor?
Speaker 2: His name was John White.
Speaker 1: Okay. And what was your dissertation about?
Speaker 2: It was--well so I studied membrane transport, movement of water and particles across cell membranes across the intestinal tract. And it's the basis of diarrheal diseases and development of urine in the kidneys, secretions across many types of tissues. So I can give you the title if you want. It's "The Effect of Theophylline on Amphiuma Small Intestine".
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: You're welcome. So I generally tell--when people ask me what my field is, I tell them I study diarrhea. That pretty much gets people to think about what it is.
Speaker 1: Yes. Yes. And so I'm tempted to ask you if your dissertation ran on and on but I'm not going to ask that question. So--
Speaker 2: Well it, you know I, you know it--I finished school in '78 [1978] so I took really four and a half years. Nowadays, seven years is not unusual. But I remember that we were packing to move the day that I had my defense for my dissertation. I did, oh I did get married and have a kid, a son.
Speaker 1: And did you meet your husband while you were in grad school?
Speaker 2: I met my husband while I was in graduate school and we were about ready to move to Pittsburgh where I was going to do my post-doc and my advisor and someone else on my committee were having an argument about a scientific theory and I told them that I was leaving and I was done and they needed to decide it so that I could be finished. But that fight did not involve me so I went on.
Speaker 1: Well let me ask you a few more questions about it though. Like how did you select this topic for your dissertation?
Speaker 2: So once I had started kind of doing a rotation in the lab with, in John White's lab, I decided to stay with it. I enjoyed the work. I enjoyed the biophysical part of it because in that you're measuring things using sophisticated electronic instruments and so that was a lot of fun and that was the focus of his lab and that's how I decided top do that project. He more or less gave me that project to do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we published together several papers on that.
Speaker 1: And what were your findings?
Speaker 2: So my major findings of that work was that there were two areas in the intestine, two cell types that actually contributed to fluid secretion. The dogma before that had been that the absorption of nutrients occurred in the, at the upper most or the tip of the intestine area called the villus cells and that the crypt cells, the ones that were at the base actually were responsible for secretion. And what we were able to show was that both areas contributed to secretion of fluids in that area.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was a major change in the dogma of the time. I remember going to a meeting and having to defend it.
Speaker 1: So this is a major contribution to biology and--
Speaker 2: It's a major contribution. Right, to the field, yes.
Speaker 1: To the field, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright. Because before they only thought of the one way that that could--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm. And that's often the case and the way it is in science. But you have to be a very--you know I talked about the fact of being interviewed for graduate school and being told that maybe that's not the place for you. But because of my Spelman experiences I had the confidence to say well if you don't give it to me I will get it someplace else. So in the sciences some people are not so friendly. You have to have that fortitude to stand up for what you know to be true.
Speaker 1: Now with all the years of study of biology in Atlanta, did you ever have any interaction with the Center for Disease Control?
Speaker 2: Very little, very little. I did later when I went to be on the faculty but during that time I don't know of anyone when I was a student that really had much to do with that. We were mentored by physicians, I talked about the course that we had. Some of us had an opportunity to do research. We had an opportunity to go to the Grady Hospital at the time to look at things but I don't remember interacting with the CDC.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25898
Speaker 1: Okay, alright. So University of Pittsburgh, so the family moves to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] and--
Speaker 2: Family moves to Pittsburgh.
Speaker 1: --it was 1979.
Speaker 2: This is 1978.
Speaker 1: '78 [1978], okay.
Speaker 2: I called it the rolling defense party because I had graduate students come help move, I just had my defense and we're off and running it Pittsburgh. I was, had planned a career in academic medicine and that was that I was going to go to a medical school and teach medical students. If you were going to do that very much like a physician does a residency, as a scientist you have to do a post-doc. When it was time for me to think about where I would do that, John White said well why don't you write Stan Schultz and I didn't think that I would have an opportunity to work with him because he was the leader in the field at that time and he accepted me into his lab which was in Pittsburgh and off we went. I was the first woman that he had ever taken into his lab and the first and only person of color that he had had.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So in many respects I was another pioneer at that time.
Speaker 1: So what did you work on at the University of Pittsburgh?
Speaker 2: So I pretty much worked in the same type of field and that is ion transport, different model system, different animal system and that's when I started to refine my techniques. So it was really looking at the same type of problem but whenever you have advances in the sciences you can relate them to an advance in technology. So by the time I had gone there the technology had started to change so I worked in the same general area but using more advanced technology than I did when I was a graduate student.
Speaker 1: Okay. So you were there--is there anything important from the University of--that experience or what's the most important thing that came out?
Speaker 2: Well there are a couple of things. One, because Stan was so well known in the field there were all types of scientists who were very known scientists who came there to work with him or who breezed through the lab. So I met people, scientists from around the world so that was very important. And the other thing that I found out later, you might remember I said something about the William Townsend Porter Foundation. Well the president of the foundation was a person by the name of Cliff Barger. Cliff Barger had sponsored the physiology course that I was in through the foundation. Cliff and Stan had been graduate students together at Harvard [University]. So what I didn't know at the time was that Cliff Barger, Stan, the chair of the Department at Emory [University] saw me as an opportunity to increase the number of minorities in physiology and I think that's important because I think that's one reason that--I didn't know that, but Stan took me in the lab and I was well trained. I had great grades and what have you, but I think it was Harvard connection. I didn't realize that until later, maybe about two years that they had all come out of Harvard together.
Story_ID: 25899
Speaker 1: Okay. So now in--it says that you took another post-doc at the University of Texas.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Health Science Center.
Speaker 2: In Houston [Texas].
Speaker 1: Houston.
Speaker 2: So the thing about that is that I had been in the lab a week when Stan called me in, he--and said, I hear you probably have heard the rumor that I'm moving to Houston. I said yes I had from the other post-docs. He said well don't worry about it because you'll move with me. So I went home and told my husband that, don't unpack those boxes because we'll be moving to Houston. So I only spent 16 months in Pittsburgh and then when Stan moved his lab to Houston, I moved with him. So it was very much you know it was just a continuation of the same type of environment. Houston had a lot of money and they were building the medical school using the oil money in Texas. It was a very rich environment at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay. So you arrive there in 1979, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And, okay so you continued doing the same research--?
Speaker 2: So slightly different, continued to define my techniques and then you know things happened. People did not know that I had a Ph.D. They would always assume that I was the lab technician so when I--people would come, well I was the only person of color and that's what people would assume that you know you were not the lead scientist, that you were the lab tech. I've always had to live with that.
Speaker 1: Now were there any other women?
Speaker 2: There were very few women in the department and I quite frankly don't recall any female post-docs other than me so I was the only one that was there and the only one that I recall in the department. So I worked with a bunch of white males during that time. And you know great colleagues, you know I really enjoyed it but again always this thing of having to be better, to be on top of your game because that's what it takes. So I'm in the lab during an experiment, Stan comes in and says Pamela, Cliff Barger--this is when I figured out they knew one another--and I think it's time for you to get a real job. And I said can I finish this experiment first, which time I started applying for positions.
Speaker 1: Okay. So he didn't have a job for you, he was--
Speaker 2: Well but that was not the way that it was because when you are a post-doctoral fellow, it's a fellowship to train you to be an independent scientist. So he didn't need another one of me to you know to be really in the group. And in some respects he did me a favor. There was one gentleman who was a post-doc in the lab that he did keep and make a faculty member and that person didn't turn out too well. I think I turned out much better so sometimes people do you a favor when they help you to move on and that was the case. I never even thought about staying. It was that I was going to move someplace else.
Speaker 1: Okay. So what about your research there--were there any notable conclusions that you reached at the University of Texas?
Speaker 2: So there's a very important paper that was one of the seminal papers that was about how--basically what we found was that there were two separate events that occurred at the level of the membranes that was responsible for nutrient transport. There was one event that occurred at the front of the apical part of the cell, the cell--the side that's the intake part that faces the lumen, the opening of the intestine, and that you could track in time when the second process that was at the base that faces the blood side turned on that allowed absorption of nutrients across. And we got lucky because of the animal model that we had used, the cells in that animal were much, much larger than they are in mammalian cells. This was in a salamander and therefore you could separate out the timing of those two events because the cells were so large and that was a major, a major finding in the field at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25900
Speaker 1: Okay. Now you were, in 1981, you joined the research, the Armed Forces Radiology Research Institute as a research scientist.
Speaker 2: Right. So when it was time for me to get a real job of course I had planned on going into academic medicine. I was offered a job at Brown University School of Medicine. I was offered a job at the University of Texas Southwestern School of Medicine in Dallas and then offered a job at this placed called AFRBRI, Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute. I was all set to take the job at Brown but then something happened that gave me a very bad feeling. And that was that they kept dragging their feet on making the selection telling me that one of the people they wanted to interview had just had a baby and couldn't come in to interview. This had been months and months and months. I knew the person that they were interviewing because it's a very small field. All of us would go to meetings together. His wife wasn't having a baby. I don't know what was going on. And then when they finally made up their minds, the dean called me and said we want to offer you the job but you have to tell us now. And I'm like well, I don't know if I can--well we can only give you tomorrow because we don't want to lose the number two person. And I had read and knew that they had a class action suit against them for discrimination against people of color and women and that started not to smell too good to me. And so you know after I went home and thought about it and talked to my husband about it, I got very angry and decided I didn't need that. So I called him up and said no thank you to the job. Well what's, you know what's happened? You know of course we want you to come. You must have accepted another job. No. I didn't say anything but I didn't have a job but I didn't need that job, at which point I got a call from Cliff Barger again cause they're all--it's incestuous, they all know one another. You didn't take the Brown job? I said no and I told him what happened. So I ended up going to AFRBRI in Bethesda, Maryland. They had just started a new unit up and emphasis on gastrointestinal physiology. The chair of the department knew my graduate advisor and the government had a lot of money. And if you have a lot of money you can buy a lot of toys.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: You're at AFRRI [Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute] now they call it.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah. So you published a number of papers at AFRRI and--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --what were you assigned to do there, to research certain topics in gastrointestinal (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well the interesting thing was that I continued to do the research that I wanted to do and when I was recruited to go there, the chair of the department said you really don't have to worry about fitting in with the mission what--the work you already do fits with the mission. So it was more of a, of--when I went there I never thought that, thought about the mission of the institute was to look at the effect of radiation on various systems or to try to come up with a radio protective agent cause this was still during the time of the Cold War. But the research that I did on fluid and electrolyte transport fit in well with that mission. So I was a research scientist, we were very much behaved as an academic department. Most of the sciences, most of the scientists were civilians. Most of the lab technicians and what have you were military corpsmen, medical specialists who supported our labs. But the core was civilian. So I led my own lab and then I was promoted to project manager where there were three labs that I was responsible for and that's when I first learned a little bit about fundraising because it--now it was no longer did I just have to make my work fit into the mission of the institution. I was responsible for helping the other labs to fit their work into the mission of the institution. So it was kind of a back and forth with respect to setting priorities. At the time I was the highest ranking African American female in the defense nuclear agency and it was a great time. We had lots of money just to do things. I continued to go back to Spelman [College] and teach for a week as a visiting professor. It was important for me to continue to have academic credentials so I had appointments at the George Washington School of Medicine and also at the Uniform Services School of Medicine so I continued to teach. And now you know I know I look at that experience. It set me up for my next career in a way that I had not anticipated at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay. Your next career being administration or--?
Speaker 2: My next career was going to Spelman.
Speaker 1: Going to Spelman okay. Oh okay where we're at now.
Speaker 2: So I stayed, well I stayed at AFRBRI for twelve years. When I was a project manager I had started to getting into science administration. So by then I had responsibility or allocation of resources. I had responsibility for evaluations. I had responsibility for the overall project and evaluation of the work that was done selling the program to the Board of Generals as they called it. So AFRBRI gave me that administrative base that helped me to move to Spelman and because in fact I had maintained my academic ties that was the other base that I needed to move on to Spelman when that call came.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now I just have a question. What did you learn about radiation in terms of gastrointestinal issues?
Speaker 2: So I was involved in a number of projects at that time. Before some of my work which turned out to be quite controversial, it was thought that the effect of radiation was really just because of the breakdown of the integrity of the tissue. So everything just starts to leak. And one of the things that I was able to demonstrate was that it wasn't just--yes, the breakdown of the tissue did occur later but there was also something that set the stage for fluid and electrolyte loss just like in any other type of diarrheal disease. So as a result of that, that allowed us to start thinking about different types of treatment regimens that people had not thought about before.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was pretty much the basis of that work that I did at that time.
Story_ID: 25902
Speaker 1: Okay, alright. So you had been teaching at Spelman [College] and at George Washington [University] and--
Speaker 2: So I had been teaching as a visiting professor at Spelman for about 15 years before I went back. I had students in my--Spelman students who would come and work with me in my lab. I would provide those opportunities for them. I was a faculty member at the George Washington School of Medicine. I taught graduate students and medical students and I also had a faculty appointment at the Uniform Services University. So I taught more than most scientists taught that were in academia because I enjoyed teaching. And I thought it was important to continue to have that credential.
Speaker 1: Okay. In 1992, you won the Directors Award for Distinguished Service by, from AFRBRI, right?
Speaker 2: Right. So when I left I got the award for distinguished service. A year or two before that I had gone to Brussels to NATO [North Atlantic Treaty Organization, intergovernmental military alliance] and I had been designated the U.S. Representative to the NATO Working Group on Radiation Induced Gastrointestinal Injury. A long title but you know when you would see NATO meetings on TV with people with their headphones on and the simultaneous translations, that's what that was like. It was pretty amazing and I was the U.S. representative to that working group which was quite an honor.
Story_ID: 25903
Speaker 1: Alright. So at Spelman [College], well tell us now you came into the biology department as the chairman, right?
Speaker 2: Yes. So I'm sitting at AFRBRI [Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute] in my office which was in a converted closet. The back end of the old closet, they had cut an opening out into the lab so out of the concrete block wall and I--the phone rings. I'm sitting there working on something. I pick up the phone and this voice says, Hello Pamela. This is Johnnetta Cole [Johnnetta Betsch Cole, first African American female president of Spelman College] and the ancestors say it's time for you to return home. No secretary, no assistant, the Johnnetta Cole calling me up on the phone. And so I remember going home telling my husband, well you know the ancestors have said it's time to return to Atlanta [Georgia] and I think because it was Spelman, because we had started our lives in Atlanta, we made the decision to pack up and to move back to Atlanta. At the time I was thinking why me? I didn't know--I had never been in an academic department. I didn't know anything about sharing a department but this was during the time when they were really building the sciences and they wanted to bring more of a research culture to Spelman in the sciences and I certainly had that because I had been a scientist. They also--Johnnetta thought and she actually said this in a video that was made for fundraising for Spelman about the importance of women of color seeing women of color in the classroom doing what it is that they aspire to do. Once again the William Townsend Porter Foundation plays a role in this because they had given money to Spelman for an endowed chair. So I went to Spelman as the Porter Professor of Physiology, an endowed chair which is a big deal and chair of the biology department. I had a great time at Spelman. My science colleagues said that you're ruining your career. You'll never do any science. I said to myself I am not going to win any Nobel Prize. I knew that. I'm not on that track so what does it mean if I write 30 papers, in reality very little. But if I go to Spelman and I influence 30 students and each of them writes 30 papers, I have a legacy of 900, and that's what I was thinking when I went to Spelman.
Story_ID: 25904
Speaker 1: Okay. Well what kind of a balance did Spelman [College] offer you in terms of research and teaching?
Speaker 2: So the teaching load at Spelman at the time that I went back was 3:3. So you taught three courses a year. If you were--I mean three courses a semester. If you were a department chair you got a course release and if you had a research grant, which I did, you got another--you could buy out time. So I ended up teaching probably about a course load of 2:1 or 1:1 during the time that I was at Spelman cause I also directed big programs for Spelman. So the Howard Hughes program at Spelman I was director, the Remi program. And all of those programs had funding for the directors to have release time to do the work. So even at Spelman, most of my time was involved in administration, running the department, recruiting faculty, looking at courses, doing my own research in my own lab and running educational programs that were externally funded. So I only taught maybe two courses during the year when I was at Spelman because I had time that was bought out for that.
Speaker 1: Okay. Well, and you're still doing--so you're still doing research, right?
Speaker 2: So I set up my lab at Spelman. AFRBRI [Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute] gave me some of the equipment that I had so I didn't have to start from scratch. I actually ran my laboratory like it would be at a graduate school. So I had students who were working with me, I took students as sophomores and then by the time they were seniors I would call them my senior students and they would have a lot of responsibility so it's each one, teach one type model. I put their names on papers, I took them to meetings. Then when I had funding I hired a research technician and I also had a post-doctoral fellow while I was at Spelman. So my lab got to be fairly large at Spelman, especially for someone whose life had turned from, professional life turned from a scientist, a researcher who taught to a teacher who did research. I still did a great deal of that. I'm proud of many of the things that we did at Spelman during that time. We really created a rich culture for research and science in the biology department. We hired faculty who were research intensive who could get grants and that in turn provided opportunities for students to work in our own labs.
Speaker 1: Well who did, who came into the program that--?
Speaker 2: So some of the people who came into the department during that time, one was Jann Primus [Dr. Jann Patrice Primus]. Unfortunately she died many years ago much too early. Another one was Mark Maloney is one that we hired, Gabba--Gawin Annanappa [ph] is another one but I don't remember all of their names but a lot of faculty that had research programs who could get grants. And there were people who had already been there. Sheila McClure is one. Sheila McClure left Spelman, now works at the NIH for minority programs. So it just became a very, very rich research environment and one of the goals was to encourage more women to go into graduate school into the basic sciences. So because so many of us had labs now and our students were interacting with one another, research didn't become like the booby prize if you didn't get into medical school. It started to be seen as a real track and we were very successful in getting students to go into graduate school in the basic health sciences.
Story_ID: 25905
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The other thing we did was build a building and that was a lot of fun, and occupy it and raise money for it. I used to--when I would go to Atlantic City to see my mom, I would rent a car and drive down 95, stop in and every pharmaceutical place along the way making friends for Spelman. So it was a lot of fun during those days.
Speaker 1: Now what was the building that you built?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: What was the building that you built and when did you build it?
Speaker 2: We occupied the building now I think in, I have to remember, around the early 2000s we occupied the building. It is the let's see, Albro Falconer Manley Science Center named after three very important female scientists at Spelman. Albro [Dr. Helen Albro] the first chair, female chair of biology at Spelman. Etta Falconer was known, was the matriarch of the sciences as Spelman. She was a marvelous woman, a mathematician who really worked on the sciences and then the other was, the other Manley was Audrey Manley who actually became a president of Spelman in later years and so that was what was that building was.
Speaker 1: And what size facility is it and when it is announced?
Speaker 2: I don't recall the exact size. I'm going to say it's 30,000 sq. ft. It was a renovation and new construction. But what was important was that the labs were designed for interdisciplinary research. The labs were all open focusing on showcasing the sciences, on scientists working together and so in my lab there were three of us that were in the lab, allowed you to share things. It was really built along the lines of the most modern concepts of how you do undergraduate research. So it was about 30,000 I think, sq. ft. or so, a sizeable project.
Speaker 1: Okay. This was a big project and this was around 2000 you said?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright. Now you were, it says here you were, in 1992--well this is, yeah, you were called the Porter Professor (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Right, that was the endowed chair, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, endowed chair and supported by the William Townsend Porter Foundation. Nineteen 1993, the program director of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, which was a grant, a million dollar grant to support our students doing research and new programs. We had three of those grants during the time that I was at Spelman and the next grant was for about $900,000 and the following grant that we had when I was there was for $1.2 million. And so we had well over three mill, about $3 million or so from them and Spelman is still supported by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. And I actually have come full circle. I sat on the--I sit on the panels that review the grants now coming in.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So you know it was a great time because--and we had--people at Spelman worked really hard in the sciences. We understood that Spelman did not have the resources to support the work we wanted to do and therefore we had to raise the money. So we spent a lot of time raising money to do the work that we wanted to do. So it's wonderful fun when you're in a position in which you can help other peoples' dreams come true. You can think about the way things should be, put them in motion and then have the money to make it happen, very different than these times, well if we had this, we can't do whatever because we don't have the funds. We had lots of money in the sciences when I was there.
Story_ID: 25906
Speaker 1: Now when you were there on the Atlanta U complex, Atlanta U was experiencing some difficulty and Morris Brown [College] closed down.
Speaker 2: Morris Brown closed down. Well first of all the sciences had always collaborated in the Atlanta University complex. From the time that I was as student, physics and chemistry was--chemistry was taken at Morehouse [College], physics was taken either at Clark [College] then or Morehouse. Math--so the sciences were always pretty much combined. Because they were small, we took some of the courses at the graduate school level so there was always good cooperation. The Atlanta University Center was undergoing change though. Before I came back you know Clark had merged with Atlanta U to become Clark Atlanta University. Morehouse School of Medicine was built during that time and got off the ground and Morris Brown was a tragedy in that you know Morris Brown went through a lot of difficulties, lost its accreditation, was in foreclosure, couldn't pay the water bill and had whittled down I understand to very, very few students. So that was a tragedy. But the rest of the center, the other schools have done well. Outside of the theological school has had some difficulties but the rest of the school if you go and you look, lots of building and it looks very prosperous.
Speaker 1: Okay. So did you ever have a time when there was a trouble in Spelman in terms of financing anything?
Speaker 2: During the time when I was at Spelman you know there were no--you know there were times when we didn't get--there was one year we didn't get a pay raise. There was another year where we got like a two percent raise but Spelman was never in danger of closing, losing its accreditation. It was always, of the schools there, Spelman financially was the strongest, even stronger than Morehouse. So no, ever was. And again in the sciences we wrote a lot of grants. I remember being at work at 11 o'clock, Audrey Manley was a night owl and her house was right across from my office. I would see the light on, I have the grant ready for signature at 11. I call her up and she say, yes Pamela. I said can I come over and get your signature? Okay. And then we would make the mad dash to Fed-X that closed at midnight. So you know we had to do that in order to get the money to do what we wanted to do. It wasn't going to happen.
Speaker 1: Okay, so everybody--
Speaker 2: So that's how we did it.
Speaker 1: --worked together and worked closely (unclear)?
Speaker 2: The departments worked together you know to put these grants together. We had money from NSF [National Science Foundation], we had money from Howard Hughes. We had money from NIH [National Institutes of Health] and of course success brings success, right? And we had a product that people wanted. There's still a dearth of African Americans and women in the sciences and we were very successful at doing that. So when you are successful, people continue to invest in your success.
Story_ID: 25907
Speaker 1: Okay. Now the NI--there was an NIH [National Institutes of Health] grant in 2002 that established the Center for Biomedical and Behavioral Research and Research Infrastructure for Minority Institutions?
Speaker 2: Right. And that was $5 million and we had several of those. So the sciences, you know and unfortunately there was some jealousy with other parts of campus but what people didn't realize was that we were raising this money, we were staying there till midnight. We did not have a grant writer that was writing the grants. We had grant support in that they would put the finishing touches on it. But the faculty were writing those grants and moving those grants through, making the mad dash to Fed-X. Then we got better, we used Delta Dash cause you could fly them, so you learn those tricks to do that.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now you're still doing research during all this period of time too?
Speaker 2: And I'm still doing research and have a funded grant and still running my lab.
Speaker 1: There's a name of a paper here, probably one among many, a 2003 paper called "Characterization of Pure Inter--
Speaker 2: --Purinergic Receptors--
Speaker 1: --Purinergic Receptor Modulation--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --of Iron Transport in Cultured Guinea Pig Gallbladder Cells."
Speaker 2: Right. Right, so one of the things that we did that was very important was to develop what you call a primary cell culture. It means you take the, they isolate the cells and you're able to get them to grow in an incubator and then you have something that you can really work on. I remember when the grant was reviewed people were concerned about whether or not we would really be able to do it and we did. But the other thing I said is that by this time, remember I'm doing, quite frankly I'm doing too many things. I'm spread fairly thin. I'm trying--I'm still teaching one course now that meets about four hours a week, my physiology course. In some respects I'm either running the department or I'm the associate provost for science and math. I'm trying to have an identity outside of Spelman in the sciences and do research. I was fortunate that I had a post-doc in my lab and I had a research technician who was as good as running my lab as I could be. And it got kind of funny because they--my students and my technician and post-doc actually forgot that I knew how to do those things. So when I came into the lab it was like, well she doesn't know how to do that. Well yeah, I taught all of you. But I wouldn't have been able to do it without that support.
Speaker 1: Okay. And now you had children too right, to raise?
Speaker 2: I had children then as well. So I had--
Speaker 1: How many did you have in this period?
Speaker 2: So I have--I had two kids. One I had in graduate school and he was a student when--not when we, the family moved back to Atlanta, he went to Morehouse [College]. And then I had a little one who was five when we went back. I had a big gap between my two kids and so yes I had two kids and a husband. But I was very fortunate that I had a husband who has always celebrated my success and I was often times the mother who was able to make it when my kid was about to be on stage, I would get there but the teachers and what have you mostly knew my husband rather than knew me. My older son and younger son talk about those days especially when I was on panels for the NIH. I was the only person of color on the panel, one of very few women. Every time I walked into that national setting I had to prove myself and that I had earned a place there, that I wasn't just a token which meant that I had to prepare. And so my family knew that when it was time for me to prepare for those meetings they weren't going to see me for two weeks and my sons recall that of their childhood of the missing mom for two weeks when I was preparing for one of those meetings. It was necessary to be successful.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25908
Speaker 1: Now you were an American Council on Education Fellow--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --at the University of Miami, 2003, 2004.
Speaker 2: So after--I was chair of the biology department for ten years at Spelman. I was associate provost for science and math for one year. I had started--I had never been on a sabbatical. Most people take a sabbatical every seven years or so. So I was trying to figure out what I wanted to do next. About that time I had decided that I wanted to stay in higher education administration. I wanted to be a provost. So I started thinking about what I needed to do to get there. So the first thing I did was to do a summer program called the HERS Program for Women in Higher Education Leadership. That was in, I think the summer of 2001.
Speaker 1: Now what does HERS stand for? Does it--?
Speaker 2: Higher Education Resource Services. Have no idea why it's named that but it is really a women's leadership development program and it--for administration. And I now sit on their board of directors so I've come full circle on many of these things now. So I did that for a summer for four weeks at Bryn Mawr and figured out that I knew a lot. I knew a lot because of the experiences I had had at Spelman. I had fundraising experience. I had had legal experience cause I dealt with that. So in many respects it was affirming that I had a lot of those pieces. And while I was there I thought about perhaps being a president one day and so I started thinking about what those next steps would be if I wanted to do that. So another opportunity came for the year, the American Council on Education Fellowship. They select a class of about 34 individuals, it's highly competitive. I was actually able to get a scholarship from them, the Bush Hewitt Fellowship that paid all of my expenses. You get to go to another institution for a year and be mentored directly by a president. I wanted to go to a place that was different than Spelman so I didn't go to a woman's college or an HBCU or a small school and I ended up going to the University of Miami, not a bad place, for the year, working with Donna [Edna] Shalala. And I focused on budgets and financial aspects and the business aspects and fundraising pretty much while I was there. It was a fabulous year because you get to be a fly on the wall. You have no vested interest in the outcome so it was a great experience.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25909
Speaker 1: Okay. So we were saying off, just saying once again that Donna Shalala knew Johnnetta Cole, right?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: She had been the mentor of Johnnetta Cole.
Speaker 2: She had mentored Johnnetta Cole which I really didn't know at the time so that when I asked her, was talking to her about coming and spending a year, she said well did Johnnetta Cole hire you? I said yes. And she's like well when do you want to come? And the other thing is that Manley, Audrey Manley had worked with Donna Shalala when she was in the Public Health Service as acting surgeon general and Donna Shalala was the head of Health and Human Services in the cabinet. So we're all connected in ways in which we don't know often times.
Story_ID: 25910
Speaker 1: Now you were learning about how to be a provost. What is a provost?
Speaker 2: So the provost is the chief academic officer of an institution and more. I am provost and academic vice president so I have responsibility for all academic programs here at Drew University and academic support. So we have three schools here at Drew, a theological school, a graduate school and an undergraduate college. The deans of those three schools report to me. I also have campus life and student affairs. The dean of students reports to me. I have technology, the career center. Anything that has to do with academics and academic supports, I'm ultimately responsible for. I spend most of my time in meetings and facilitating the work of others. To me that's what that job entails because I don't know, I'm not an expert in any one thing. I know a lot about most of them. And I had decided that that was my next step because I wanted to be part of the president's cabinet so that I would have an opportunity to see all parts of higher education administration. As a dean of a school you don't necessarily get that. As a vice president of academic affairs where you are, you may not get that. But here I'm considered second to the president and when the president's not around, I'm the go-to person so it's a great deal of responsibility and I've learned about all different types of things for higher education administration.
Speaker 1: Okay. So the provost convenes the chairs of the departments or the dean--?
Speaker 2: So I convene the deans--
Speaker 1: The deans, right.
Speaker 2: --but, and the deans work with the chairs of the departments in the programs. I bring people together at the tables that have to do with technology, the registrar's office, campus life of student affairs, many different types of offices come up under my umbrella. And I'm also the first provost that they had had here at Drew and they had not had an academic vice president in 15 years before I came here so it was an interesting situation to come into.
Story_ID: 25911
Speaker 1: Now how was the--how did you come into this situation? You were at Spelman and things were great at Spelman [College] and 2005 you got the Spelman College Alumni Achievement Award and health and science you know so why would you leave Spelman?
Speaker 2: Well things happen at times in which you know it was time to leave. I was having a great time. You'll notice I've spent a long time at every place that I've been. I was at AFRRI [Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute] for 12 years, Spelman for 14 years, but then the administration changed at Spelman. There was a new president. That president decided to change the administrative structure and to do away with the position that I had of associate provost for science and math, go to a vice provost type model. That happened, the year that I was at Spelman before I went on my ACE Fellowship, I had to dissolve my office essentially and farm out my grants and what have you to other people. I left and came back--you're obligated to spend a year and I had to make a decision. Either I was going to stay at Spelman and build my own empire again. I can write grants, I can get money. When you have your own money people leave you alone to kind of do what you want to do. But if I was going to be--stay in higher education administration, I would have to leave. And it was difficult for me to leave but I made the decision that I would leave. So I started to focus on provost positions at institutions, small institutions that were not like Spelman but were enough like Spelman that I would have the experience that I wanted. And I wanted to be a provost because I wanted to be part of the president's campus cause I had thought about being a president at some point and I needed to have that experience. So I put myself out on the job market for a year, I ended up coming to, being selected to come to Drew. Drew is small. We only have about twenty-six, twenty-seven hundred students but because we have three schools it's extremely complex. And I had an opportunity to be the confidant if you will of the president that hired me and to be on decision making from when to close to school because of snow to health benefits, to retirement benefits, to what new programs we're going to start and what faculty we're going to hire, so a well-rounded experience in the highest level of higher education administration. It's been a great ride, I've enjoyed it. We've accomplished a lot here.
Story_ID: 25912
Speaker 1: Okay. So you came on in 2006.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And what have been some of the milestones since 2006?
Speaker 2: So some of the things that had hap- that have happened is that we've made great strides in diversifying the student body. Prior to I guess in 2005, with respect to underrepresented minorities, Hispanics and African American students, incoming class was about eight percent and now it's grown to nearly thirty percent. That's remarkable I think for any institution and we've done it quickly. The students graduate on time and they're retained in some respects at a higher rate than the other students. I've worked with science faculty here in developing a vision in programming and designing a new science center which is actually we are now fundraising for and I have experience doing that so that was one of the reasons that the president, then president was interested in having a scientist. I've brought the three schools together for sharing of resources. We hired two years ago our first joint appointment across the theological school as well, and the college a young, very bright Latino who is teaching not only theological school students but also teaching undergraduates. That never would have happened in the past. We've upgraded our standards and expectations for promotion and tenure, increased research emphasis for faculty. So I think that there have been a lot of accomplishments that I can speak about during my time here. It's kind of funny in this world when you're dealing with faculty and faculty governances, it's very different than being in corporate America or in a research institute because our faculty have a lot of say in what goes on. So sometimes you take five steps forward, three steps back, another two forward, one back. And so change occurs slowly in academia but I think we have accomplished a lot so those are some of the things that we've done.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25913
Speaker 1: Okay. Now you serve currently on the Board of directors of the William Townsend Porter Foundation--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --and the Higher Education Resources Services (unclear).
Speaker 2: So that's what I mean by coming full circle. So now I am on the Board of Directors of the Porter Foundation without whose support, I would not have been able to go to Emory School of Medicine. I see that as my way of giving back to those who gave to me. And I'm also on the Board of the HERS group that I continue the training of women who are interested in going into higher education administration, another way of giving back. So I, remember when I said that when I went, when I left AFRRI [Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute] to go to Spelman [College], I wanted to have an impact. I'm still very much that type of person and I look at my service on those boards and on scientific panels, review panels where we're deciding who's going to get money as a way of giving back for those who have helped me along the way.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now here we are in 2013. There was a discussion last night on 60 Minutes about women in the workplace, the new CEO of Facebook you know is suggesting that you know women have too much time off and they ought to get in there and just push forward like men and you know that sort of thing. I mean it's--I don't know if I'm representing her completely but what's your opinion now of women in the workplace in terms of doing high level work like you are doing with families and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: I often when I speak to younger women you know, I have to be careful when I say young women. I speak to a range of women in different fields of, stages of their lives. I'm often asked about balance and I'm very truthful in saying that you will find that something will suffer. It is impossible to have absolute balance in everything that you do and to be successful. You might recall that I said--I'm fortunate that I have the spouse that I do, that I was the parent who ran to make it when my son came on stage. My kids recall times when I was getting ready for a meeting in which I was the absent parent. Now what I would do is cook up meals and put them in the refrigerator and then they would just go to McDonalds. I figured they wouldn't die from that. But I think it's very difficult to have it all. You can have parts of all of it but you can't have all of everything. And my mother taught me that, that one of the things she always told me was that you had to take care of yourself. There was no knight, you know white horse coming to take care of you and I've always kept that in mind. So there is still in this country today very much a glass ceiling and there is a stained glass ceiling. That if you are a woman of color it, people may have all the best intentions but when you are a woman of color, people start thinking about, well how is that person going to interact with others? How are Boards going to feel if that person is there? How are funders going to feel? So my response is that there will be choices that will have to be made. When I would have students who, at Spelman who would come to me, some of them would have children and they were trying to figure out how they were going to negotiate things. I would tell them you know so and so every morning you get up and you put on that Superwoman t-shirt and you never forget that that's who you have to be. You always have to be better, you always have to be more confident and that's especially--and better prepared and that's especially the case still for women of color. It's unfortunate but it's true. The only time that I have been fortunate that I've had times in my life when I didn't have to deal with that and that's when I was at Spelman. When I was a student at Spelman I think that's why I developed the way that I did. I'm a scientist because no one told me that women aren't scientists or black women aren't scientists. When I went to Spelman as a faculty member, suddenly it was as if a weight had been lifted off my shoulder because I was no longer the representative. I was not only the--I was no longer the only one. I didn't have to worry about the big fall from the top and it was very empowering. Having that, I come here now and I'm kind of back to my other mode of action that I have to be better I have to be prepared and I have to always remember who I am, stay--the stained glass ceiling is still intact.
Speaker 1: Okay. Do you still entertain aspirations of being a president?
Speaker 2: I do. I do. I have, I am extremely close. It's not public but there will be an announcement this week I think that I have met that mark. So--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's not public yet but I have achieved that. I'm waiting for the ink to dry on the paper before it comes public. My mom told me--my mom had, who was quite the professional, had always aspired to be the wife of a university president. And she said to me, well maybe you'll get to do that and it looks like I will have that opportunity soon.
Speaker 1: Well congratulations.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: Alright.

Speaker 1: So now what is your vision for Drew [University] I guess in the future, I guess with that being said? Or is it, I don't even know if it's at Drew though but I shouldn't even, I shouldn't assume that.
Speaker 2: Well you know my--I'm very much committed to Drew. This is where I am now. I've spent seven years here. Drew like many schools like ours, are under financial stress. My vision for Drew is that Drew continues to be what it is meant to be, what it is still to become. That it still celebrates the diversity. We can talk about online education, we can talk about mukes [ph] which are really big now. We can talk about public education but I think there will always be a place for institutions like Drew, small, residential institutions that do more than just prepare students for a career. They give them the type of a skill set that they need to have critical thinking, to problem solve, to think outside of the box, to be able to take new knowledge and to translate it into new ways of understanding. That's what an institution like Drew does and my goal you know while I'm here is for Drew to continue to do that and to do it in a way in which it can provide access to those students who will value this type of education. We will have to change some of the things that we do here. This model of education is very expensive and so we are in the process now of figuring out how we're going to continue to do it. But Drew is remarkable place. Drew, you know was founded in 1867. Drew will be here for the long term serving its mission, training people for ministry, we train teachers. We have really an emphasis on social justice and engagement with the community and global engagement and we'll continue to do that work.
Story_ID: 25915
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about the history of Drew [University]. This room we're sitting in was a dining hall of a residence right? It's huge.
Speaker 2: This room was the dining hall of a residence. In the basement there is a kitchen that has what looks like the old kitchen that has the old brick, wood burning stove in the basement here. Every room has a--fireplaces. Drew was started as a theological school by the United Methodist Conference. It's one I think of 14 seminaries. Our seminary is quite progressive in nature, it's fairly well known. And then in the--it was, this estate was bought by Daniel Drew who was somewhat of a scoundrel. He was a cattleman and a riverboat person and he actually is where the term watered down stocks came from, underwater stocks because he, as they would drive the cattle to New York, they would stop out here, they would dehydrate them and then give them a lot of salt and let them drink water and you know they would gain 50 percent more weight. And of course you know when you're paying by the pound, that's the way to make a profit. Some people say that Daniel Drew bought this place and gave it to the United Methodist Church as his way into heaven. I don't know if that's true or not. But this was the Gibbons Estates. They had race horses, some very famous race horses during that time. So this is a historic building. At one time it was all chopped up into small offices. There was a fire in the late 80s [1980s] that was set off by someone, they were using a blow torch to burn off some of the paint up on the roof when they were getting ready to repaint and there's a center hallway here that opens up to the second floor and so that just brought the air in and it burned. So they were able to use the money from the insurance from historic preservation to restore it to its state. So the rooms here are quite spacious again and are decorated in the period. The, there were brothers, the Baldwin Brothers gave a million dollars to the school to start an undergraduate college, college of the liberal arts. It's called Brothers College because the brothers, the Baldwin Brothers gave the money. That started in the 1920s. And we have great programs in a number of fields, the theater arts, economics and a strength, a growing strength in the sciences. And then a graduate school, graduate programs opened in the 60s [1960s]. So the oldest part is the seminary here at Drew.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25916
Speaker 1: When you look back at your career to this point, what would you say is your legacy, professional legacy?
Speaker 2: When I think about my professional legacy I think of the opportunity that I've had to influence the lives of others. That might be when I've mentored faculty members and have sent them on their way but it's really my students, my students who have become physicians. I have MD, Ph.D. students who started in my lab, MD students, graduate students and they're off doing great things. That's my legacy because it means that the work that I've done will continue and will have value. You know papers to me kind of come and go. People forget who wrote them. But to have an impact on the world, that's what I think about. Those students are still in touch with me. I've celebrated their weddings, their babies, their graduate careers. They call me on the phone when they need advice and I've also taught Drew students when I meet them on the path, it's always a warm embrace. I talk to them about their next steps. So it's really about having a legacy of having an impact and helping others to be more than perhaps they thought they could be. That's what people did for me. That's the way that I give back.
Story_ID: 25917
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: I, you know my concerns are around, I'm an educator primarily now. My concerns are around access to education. It is still the portal to being able to do, to life's work, to have opportunities, to have careers and to move forward in life. This type of education is out of reach for many of us. Public education is out of reach for many of us. That's why Obama has such a focus on affordable, higher education. It is the future of the world and it is the future for our people. It's always been the future, the way out so to speak is through education. It's very difficult for a person of color to have you know a lot of people can make it in industry, they can make it as CEOs of companies or they might have a family business. I think that's difficult for us. So my concern about that is access. The other concern I have deals with the in which we treat one another, the way in which we have lost many of our values, that we have lost many of our mentors. My dad whose oral history was taken not for this program but for another, talked about in his interview that desegregation wasn't necessarily good all the time. That during the days that he came up you know students from public housing you know still had great mentors. And so have we lost that, have we lost those opportunities? And that's what concerns me for the nation and especially for people of color is to have the opportunity to move forward. Clearly when you think about the violence, the loss of respect for life, gangs, we're searching for something but we're not searching for the right thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That concerns me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25918
Speaker 1: Well tell us something about your children now and your family.
Speaker 2: So I'm blessed to have a supportive spouse. We made a decision when we got married, he said well--he was a professional actor. He actually worked with Samuel L., and LaTanya Richardson, all of them were colleagues. And then when they moved to New York he stayed in Atlanta and ultimately now he works for IBM as a systems administrator. But he, the deal that we made was that I would have to travel around and he would be there when he could. And so we have been on this journey together for well over 35 years. My oldest son was in the family business as a licensed funeral director. The business burned a year and a half ago and so now we're trying to regroup from--for that. So he took up that part of the business. My youngest son is the photographer and the musician. He plays four different instruments. Unlike me he is not tone deaf and his hobby was photography and he's turned it into his profession. So my one son, oldest son lives in Nashville. My youngest son lives in Auburn, Alabama. He never left Auburn. And no marriages, no grandchildren. Maybe that will find that in time, we shall see.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now is there anything else before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Okay. Well I just wanted to comment a bit about my paternal grandmother's family because we didn't talk about that very much because we know more about that, about her than anyone else. We know for example my paternal grandmother's name was Alice Jordan. She was the daughter of a woman who was named Donna. I've forgotten the last name. I think it's Lewis, something like that. She was the daughter of Rachel Brooks from Gainesboro, Tennessee and Rachel Brooks was the daughter of a woman named Moriah Stiles [ph]. Moriah Stiles was a slave of Joe Stiles. Her daughter Rachel was sold as a teenager to a man by the name of Richard Brooks. He was a judge in Tennessee and is a signer of the Tennessee State Constitution. Rachel's daughter Donna, and who was my great-great grandmother, the Brooks family as was in the times in the south gave their children a lot of land. So it was my--all of the, I would say all of the men in the family have married well because when William Gunter married Alice, she came with property that had been passed down from Dickie Brooks' family. And so that is the part of family that we can go back to slavery and those are the women on that side of the family who have preceded me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25919
Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as a fair, honest person who--a problem solver who took the time to listen to input of others, was collaborative but was capable of making decisions when they were necessary. I hope that my family will remember me as a loving mother, a--my hus--a spouse to my husband enough though I wasn't there all the time. And I'm also you know a person who's a lot of fun that most people generally don't get to see that, that I enjoy having a good time and doing interesting things.

Speaker 1: Okay. So this photograph is taken outside of Sister's Chapel at Spelman College. It's my mom in the sunglasses, Pearl Jeanne Kennedy, me, Pamela Gunter-Smith and my dad, Marcus Hutto Beanard Gunter. And I probably in my left hand have a diploma. So this is another Spelman commencement. I don't remember the names of the students that are with me. One was one of my lab students and the other one was a--these are two biology majors. And that's the same thing there, a Spelman commencement. Oh, so this is at a wedding of my laboratory technician, Kimi Adu Kadir and her husband, last name Mr. Opoola [ph]. She was my lab technician and a student of mine for many, many years at Spelman. That's outside my lab at Spelman with a young woman by the name of Sherry Beasley [ph] who was someone that I mentored through Spelman. This is outside of the physiology department at Emory University. If you look closely you can pick me out. I'm the one on the second row be--standing behind the gentleman with the red tie. See the gentleman with the--down, down--up, over, second from the bottom, second row from the bottom. That's the first row--
Speaker 2: That's the first row.
Speaker 1: Okay, go over to the--my left--
Speaker 2: Behind the man in the red tie?
Speaker 1: My left.
Speaker 2: Over here?
Speaker 1: No, keep going. More center, go down, that's me right--that's the guy with the red tie.
Speaker 2: Oh that's the guy in the red tie.
Speaker 1: Now you see me right behind him?
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah alright. So that's you?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The one with the--and that's the physiology department when I was a graduate student. So this, these are pictures of the farm in Marianna, Arkansas. That was my grandparents' farm, the Kennedy Farm. And if you turn it, well the family, old farm house is on my right in the center. I used to spend my summers there. Okay, and if you look at this, look at that one--turn it over.
Speaker 2: Okay, on this side?
Speaker 1: See the gentleman in there in the sailor suit, up top there? That's my grandfather as a young man when he was in the navy--
Speaker 2: Oh okay.
Speaker 1: --that we talked about. So these are from my lab at Spelman College. I'm in the center and there are students that I don't remember all of their names. I can probably think about what they are but I'm in the center and I--doing lab work, okay. That picture was taken last year. That's my family. I'm in the center. My son Leland is on the, my right, my husband J.L. Smith, J. Lawrence Smith is in the middle and that's Phillip Smith on my left. So I found this picture, this is of my grandmother with Mary McLeod Bethune. It's in her dining room. I would imagine this is around the 1950s, early 50s [1950s]. On my right in front is my cousin Lacey Kennedy, Ms. Mary McLeod Bethune and my grandmother Lucille Hamilton Kennedy. I don't know who the person is on the far left. That's a picture of me in my laboratory at AFRBRI. In some circles it's known as Warrior Woman because it appeared in a brochure that was produced by the Defense Nuclear Agency and that's about 1981. Sorry if I have so many of them. This is a picture from my ACE Fellowship with Donna Shalala in the upper frame and in the bottom that was when Hillary Clinton came to visit and that's Donna Shalala's office group, including me and President Shalala. This is a picture from convocation at Spelman College. A person on my right is Dr. LaTonya Hammonds Odi [ph] who is my post-doctoral fellow at Spelman and myself. So this is a picture that was, I've forgotten the date on this but this is the National Board of Medical Examiners. You see me there and you see the other people are chairs of departments of physiology at medical schools. And that was probably around 1993 that picture was taken. This is during the time when I was at AFRBRI. We're in the desert in New Mexico looking for radiation sources. It's a project that was classified so I won't say anything else but you can see me in the center, in the middle and we're all in radiation suits, a little dusty sorry about that. We don't need that one. It's another one of the same, different group but the same thing. Yeah, we don't need that, yeah. This is from my days on--at Spelman with--I'm on the far left. Senator Max Cleveland who was from Georgia is next to me. Audrey Forbes Manley is next to him holding his hand. She was president of Spelman then and the person next to her was a lobbyist that we worked with. And we're on the Hill raising money for Spelman.
Speaker 2: Okay. You can read what he wrote. I can't.
Speaker 1: He says, I--he says Pamela, I'm proud of you.
Speaker 2: Okay, great.
Speaker 1: I think that's what it says. I overdid the pictures. Oh, so this is the Gunter family picture. I am at the bottom seated on the floor. On the, my left behind me is my mother, Pearl Jeanne Kennedy Gunter. My father is next to her, that's Marcus Gunter. The man in the center is William Gunter, Jr. He is the photographer. With her hand on his shoulder is Anna Bell Gunter Jarrett. Next to her on the left is her husband who is Thomas Jarrett, that was the president of Atlanta University. If we go back down to the bottom to the young woman seated on the floor next to me that's Cathy Murray Williams. That is my cousin. Behind her on the right is her mother, Ewanya Murray [ph]. Next to Ewanya, the stately woman with the hair piled on her head is Rachel Lewis Patillo [ph] who was the sister of my paternal grandmother. Behind her, the women sometimes they would call Blondie is Rhohelia Crawford Gunter [ph]. She's married to William Gunter, Jr. And then standing is Thoressa Gunter Williams [ph], my father's brother. And next to her is her husband, J.T. William and then next to him is Albert Hayes Gunter. So that is the Gunter clan. This is the Kennedy clan. I'm seated in the middle. I am probably about 11 or 12 there, so that would be around 1962, '63 [1963]. My two cousins, one--I've forgotten their names right now. On the far left is my grandfather, Claude Clark Kennedy, Sr. Next to him is my grandmother Lucille Hamilton Kennedy. Next to her is his last name is McGee. He is the husband of Mary Hamilton McGee, the woman with the glasses and the young man next to her is Joe--I've forgotten his name. Well up behind him is his father, a cousin. I've forgotten, blanking on the name of those individuals, his wife. My dad, Marcus Gunter, my mother Pearl Jeanne Kennedy Gunter and next to her is Pearl Hamilton, my grandmother's sister. So that's the Kennedy clan. This was taken when my mother got her doctorate from UT. So that's my mom, Pearl Jeanne Kennedy with the diploma, my grandmother Lucille Kennedy, my grandfather Claude Clark Kennedy, Sr., and me, I look like I'm about 10. So that's the Kennedy family portrait when I was a baby. Marcus Gunter, Pearl Jeanne Kennedy Gunter, her brother, Claude Clark Kennedy, Jr., and my grandparents Lucille and Claude Kennedy. This is a family picture of the Gunter family. It is the only picture that I have of my paternal grandmother. If you look on my left, I don't know who the first gentleman is. The second gentleman is my grandfather William Gunter, Sr. Next to him is Alice Jordan Gunter. Next to her is Albert Hayes Gunter and the bride is Thoressa Gunter Williams standing next to her husband and then on the far end with--is William Gunter, Jr., and that was taken in the living room of their home in Nashville. But that's the only picture I have of my grandmother. This is when I won the Veteran's Day Essay Contest. I got to ride in the parade and I'm with the dignitaries from Tennessee and Nashville. We don't need that one. We won't show that one. That's my first communion. We don't need, I don't think we need to show that. What else we have? Okay. And so this is out, standing outside of church, this is a picture from 1923. It's one that at least has a date and if you look, the gentleman who is on the second row from the top, third from the right is my grandfather William Gunter, Sr. So in the summers I was a girl scout and a camp counselor. If you go to my far left, I'm the second person from the end. That is Camp Sycamore Hills.
Speaker 2: Okay, in the back row?
Speaker 1: I'm in the back row. I'm pretty easy to spot okay. So this is another--okay, so I would call this the Gunter and Smith family portrait. I'm in the white dress, Pamela Gunter Smith. My mother Pearl Jeanne Kennedy is behind me. The little boy is Phillip Smith, my youngest son. Behind him is my husband J. Lawrence Smith. On the far right, my right is Claude Clark Kennedy, Jr., is my mother's brother, my father Marcus Gunter and Leland Marcus Smith on the end. This was in 19, about 1992 at Leland's high school graduation.
Speaker 2: Two big ones now.
Speaker 1: Okay, we're getting down to the end, good. Okay, sorry to have so many.
Speaker 2: No, that's fine.
Speaker 1: So this is a picture, this is the Hamilton family portrait. On the far right is my grandmother as a little girl, the young girl with the bow. That's Lucille Hamilton. In the rocking chair is her big sister Pearl Hamilton. On the far left is Mary Hamilton and the young man is Wilbur Hamilton, Jr., also known as Buddy and he died in childhood. My grandmother looks to be about six in that picture. So it's likely the turn of the century.
Speaker 2: Buddy looks just like--
Speaker 1: Doesn't he look just like him?
Speaker 2: --(unclear) just like his father.
Speaker 1: So the gentleman on the right is Wilbur Hamilton and that is Bessie, the woman is Bessie Fowler Hamilton. Those are the parents of my grandmother, Lucille Hamilton.
