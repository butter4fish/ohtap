Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe, I'm interviewer today with The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Ma'am, can you please state your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My name is [HistoryMaker] Isisara Bey, I-S-I-S-A-R-A, last name B-E-Y.
Speaker 1: Is that your given name or is that a name that you acquired later on?
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't the name I was born with.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I changed my name in 1980.  Do you wanna hear the whole story?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 1: Good time to hear it too.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So we're kind of starting in the first quarter, but I was in--living in Baltimore, Maryland and very interested in my history as an African ancestored person and knew that my history extended beyond slavery and wanted to know more.  I was in college at Antioch University and met a brother who was a Hebrew Israelite.  And he was the first person who said to me I should look at the Old Testament more as a history book then as a religious book.  And I spent time with he and his family and got to understand that a bit.  And then a year later, I was taking a course in school on institutional analysis and they sent us to a prison to do some studies and to do some questionnaires with some of the inmates.  And there were a couple of inmates I had asked a question to and they would say "I--I'm gonna give you two answers.  One answer is the real answer and the other answer is the one I'm giving you for your paper," and I wanted to know what the difference was.  They were members of the Moorish Science Temple [Moorish Science Temple of America] and they were also thinking a lot about the difference between history as it's presented to us and history that we understand from our own perspectives.  And I began to explore the history of African ancestored people through the Moorish School of Law and History in Baltimore.  And while I was there, I participated in a group legal name change in 1980.  There were three sets of fifty of us who changed our names because we wanted something that was more aligned with our understanding of who we were as historical people, as cultural people, as spiritual people.  And so that is how my name was changed.  And then I married later on someone who was in the temple, so this is me.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I recognized the Bey, yeah I knew who--
Speaker 2: I'm sure.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: Okay. Yeah, what was your original name?
Speaker 2: My birth name was Andrea Nicoletta Jones.  My parents [Shirley Jones and Eustace Jones] are from Guyana, it was British Guiana at the time.  And I was named after the Andrea Doria [SS Andrea Doria] which was a ship that sank in New York [New York] and a woman named Nicolette [ph.] who my father knew during his--he was a seaman, traveled a lot and met a woman in Europe who was very kind to him and so named me after her.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I was born in Brooklyn, New York, July 18th, 1953.  Williamsburg Hospital.
Speaker 1: Okay. And what is your occupation, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Oh at the moment I am executive producer of the March on Washington Film Festival in Washington, D.C.  It is an annual civil rights themed festival of films, scholarship, first person accounts and performance.  And it happens every year annually, and we do smaller projects throughout the year with partnering organizations.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you've been a high level executive with Sony [Sony Music Entertainment] and other media?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes before that.  You know, at this stage in life I've had several careers.  I--after graduate school, I worked in radio at WEAA-FM [WEAA Radio] in Baltimore, Maryland.  I was an on air personality Monday through Friday, six to nine [o'clock], and also produced some shows in the evenings.  And was a host of the--one of the first two way talk radio programs when people would call into radio at the time.  And I left there and went to WJZ [WJZ-TV, Baltimore, Maryland], which is a television station to be an on air news producer.  I did some weekend work on the air and then moved over to Columbia Pictures.  They were starting an executive training program. This was a fast pack--fast track management program.  So they wanted people who had already finished graduate school and had some entertainment industry or media industry experience.  So they just put us in midlevel positions.  Have us shadow some of the heads of the different divisions so that we could grow into executive positions.  So that was a two year program.  My first year was in New York [New York] when Columbia owned Columbia Pictures--when Coke [The Coca-Cola Company] owned Columbia Pictures.  And then after my first year, Sony [Sony Corporation] bought the company and I moved to the headquarters which had moved then to Culver City, California.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yep, I stayed out in California for about seven or eight years until the Northridge earthquake chased me back home.  And then I transferred to Sony Music.  So in all I was with that company about twenty years.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Now what is today's date?
Speaker 2: You know, I think it's the August 29th, nine--2016.  You got me all confused, is that right (laughter) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, yeah, yeah. Yes, yes ma'am.  And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: Oh we are in Times Square, New York City.  The best city in the world.
Story_ID: 650397
Speaker 1: So before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions--
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) that we are supposed to ask that only require a short answer. They're kind of a warm up.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And the first one is do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Yes, my favorite color is orange or amber.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Saffron--in that field there.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Curry.
Speaker 1: Favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: I love the summer because I love warm weather, but I also love the holidays because I love Kwanzaa.
Speaker 1: Okay. Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Someplace I haven't been.
Speaker 1: Okay. And the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I have many, no--none that come to mind.  One came to mind this morning: the rest of my life is the best of my life.
Story_ID: 650398
Speaker 1: Well I'm gonna ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Your mother's side of the family, and your father's [Eustace Jones] side.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: We'll start with your mother's side. Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I can.  My mother's full name is Shirley Myterilla Joe [Shirley Jones], Shirley, S-H-I-R-L-E-Y, M-Y-T-E-R-I-L-L-A, J-O-E was her last name.  And she was born in Buxton, Guyana, December 31st, 1911--1914, my father was born in 1911.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay, all right. What can you tell us about your family history, how far back can you trace them and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: You know, not very far back.  I knew my mother's mother [Annie Hamer] and on one of my trips in adolescence to Guyana, I met someone who knew my mo- my grandmother's father.  But the only grandparent I knew was my mother's mother.  She lived in Georgetown [Guyana].  She worked in Georgetown and her children were in Buxton.  You know, the Guyanese and I think most Caribbeans had a similar kind of thing.  My grandmother and her children's father were not married.  And so in that time my grandmother was punished in that she was not permitted to raise her children.  She went and made money for them, and her sister raised her son and daughter.  She had two other children who were older.  I don't know who they lived with.  But my mother and her younger brother were raised by their aunt who also had a cousin living with them.
Speaker 1: Is that a common cultural type of thing in Guyana?
Speaker 2: It was common at the time, I don't think so now.  I think what's common now is--though we were never--those kinds of bonds of marriage and children were destroyed through slavery and I think my grandmother's generation and her father were just piecing those back together, although there was a strong sense of family.  It may not have been in the, I was married to you and you were married to me kind of sense.  I think in many ways we're still recovering or we are trying to force ourselves to fit into an institution that doesn't work for half the population, I'd say.  So, but unfortunately because I think of their travel and because of the way families were torn apart at that time; I don't know a lot about my grandparents or their antecedents.
Story_ID: 650399
Speaker 1: Can you tell us something about British Guiana [Guyana], about where it is in the Caribbean; and what it's like (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes. It's actually on South America.  It's on the northern tip of South America.  It's next to Venezuela and next to it is Dutch [Dutch Guiana] and French Guiana.  And Guyana achieved its independence and became Guyana from British Guiana.  It is predominantly an English speaking country, the only English speaking country on the continent of South America which is why it's more closely aligned to the Caribbean.  It has a population of, I think, around three hundred thousand people.  It's not a very big country.  And my mother [Shirley Jones] grew up in a town that was one of the first that rebelled against the British.  It's Buxton [Guyana], is known for being people with a rebellious spirit.  It's in rice planation country and it's near the Demerara River.
Speaker 1: When was independence achieved?
Speaker 2: In the 1960s, I think.  I remember both of my parents being actively involved in the first elections from New York [New York].  It was a very big Guyanese community, big to me.  Guyanese community in Brooklyn [New York] and in Queens [New York], and they were very political.
Speaker 1: So independence had to be fought for?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It did.  I remember my [maternal] grandmother [Annie Hamer] was living with us.  She had moved to New York when I was five and went home on a visit, and it took her months to be able to come back because of what was happening in Bege [ph.] as we called it at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay. I think the slavery there was over around 1830 or so, and colonialism (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't know, I know that Brazil was the last country in South America to abolish slavery, much later.  It was after the Civil War here in the United States.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think the British abolished it, but what came after wasn't that much different.
Speaker 2: Yeah, a lot of indentured servitude.  Big influx of people from India so that now under the same kinds of things, so that now the Indian population from India is larger than the African population in Guyana.
Speaker 1: That's the way it is in several countries now--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I mean, I know there's a large population of Trinidad [Trinidad and Tobago] and, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, Jamaica, yeah.
Story_ID: 650400
Speaker 1: So did your mother [Shirley Jones] have a chance to go to school there in?
Speaker 2: Actually yes.  My mother was very bright, and of her siblings, I think was the only one that had an opportunity to go to school because she was given scholarships by the missionaries.  And when she got to high school, she moved to the capital, lived with another African ancestored family, the gentleman [Robert Reuben Baird] was a headmaster and she lived with their family and ended up going to a teachers college and became a teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Do you remember the name of the school she attended?
Speaker 2: That she went to?  Queen's College [Georgetown, Guyana], I think it's called Queen's College, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. So did she aspire to move to the United States at that point or?
Speaker 2: No.  She moved to the United States because of my father [Eustace Jones].  She met my father in her mid-twenties.  She was kind of approaching spinsterhood which, you know, that meaning you know, she wasn't married and she was getting older.  And my father was already working on ships.  He left home in his teens.  He was trained to be a blacksmith.  And then in his teens started working on ships and leaving and coming back.  And on one of his trips back he asked a friend of his to help him find a wife.  And so that friend knew my mother, my mother's mother [Annie Hamer] and introduced him to my mother.  And they got married and he continued to sail and she stayed home.  She stayed in Guyana for about seven years until she was able--he was able to bring her to New York [New York].
Story_ID: 650401
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well let's go to his side of the family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now, can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes.  His name is Eustace Arthur Callendar Jones [Eustace Jones]. E-U-S-T-A-C-E, A-R-T-H-U-R, C-A-L-L-E-N-D-A-R, J-O-N-E-S.  And he, I knew--he spoke a lot about his grandfather.  He was raised by his grandfather who was Scottish.  His grandfather was the son of an overseer in Barbados and married one of the overseen and moved to Guyana eventually.  He had clipper ships from Barbados to Guyana bringing produce and things back and forth.  And I think on one trip he stayed a little too long and so his wife left Barbados and went to Guyana, and said, "I don't know what's keeping you here, but we'll stay here."  So my father, I don't really know much about his parents.  I know that his father was the son of Walter McAlpin Jones [ph.], his grandfather.  He talked a lot about his father as I was growing up.  That was his role model and mentor in life.  And I remember him telling me as he was helping me to adjust it.  In eighth grade I went away to boarding school [Academy of St. Joseph, Brentwood, New York] and it was a predominantly white boarding school.  And so part of his instruction to me was telling me something his grandfather said to him.  He said his grandfather of--often said to him, "No one is gonna mistake you for a white man, so this is how I want you to comport yourself."  And because my father identified so much with his grandfather who knew that he could do things that his grandson could not do in that society.  But he said he had red hair and a long red beard, and was the person who he emulate his--emulated his life against as I was growing up.  So, he came, he--he worked on several different kinds of ships.  He was a cook for a long time on a ship.  He was a merchant seaman.  He was on a ship that was torpedoed during World War II [WWII].  He said he was on a lifeboat for several days and then was rescued and brought to Newport News, Virginia where the Red Cross [American Red Cross] would not help him because he was black.  The Salvation Army was who helped him.  And so from then on, he would never give a dime to the Red Cross (laughter).  He said the Salvation Army was who stepped forward and gave them aid.  And then later on when my mother [Shirley Jones] came to New York [New York], he was still working and traveling a lot and she--she became ill, she had tuberculosis and was in a sanatorium for about a year, lost a lung.  And when she came out, it was at that period of time where tuberculosis was very frightening to people and he couldn't find a place for her to live, except he stayed with--in one of Daddy Grace's [Marcelino Manuel Da Graca] homes and they provided her a place to live until, you know, he could find another apartment for them to live in.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Daddy Grace the evangelist.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Who is based here in Harlem [New York, New York], right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, here in New York.  And very generous, provided food for people in apartments and--and provided a lot for folks.  And so the Salvation Army and Daddy Grace were the two people that my father had a warm spot for.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Father Divine [Reverend Major Jealous Divine] and Daddy Grace--
Speaker 2: Father Divine, exalt yes.
Speaker 1: --often seen as, you know, people see their pictures and think of them as, you know, figures that were, you know, out to, you know, run a game off people guess.  But they did a lot of good.
Speaker 2: They were very--yeah they did.  They were very benevolent and very community minded at a time when people needed that.
Speaker 1: Right, I've heard other stories about pe- people who were fed by Father Divine--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and Daddy Grace.
Story_ID: 650402
Speaker 1: So your parents come to the United States in (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes. Let's see, I think the late '40s [1940s].  My father [Eustace Jones] came first as I said and then my mother [Shirley Jones].  She came, I think, around 1947, '48 [1948], yeah.
Speaker 1: And you said earlier he was born in 1911, right?
Speaker 2: He was 1911, she was 1914, yes.
Speaker 1: Where did you--well who else was in the family, do you have--
Speaker 2: I don't have siblings, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My parents had four children who died either of--either miscarried or at birth before me, and they were about to give up and my mother got pregnant when she was thirty-nine and the doctor was advising her, because by then she had had tuberculosis, had lost a lung and he was fearful that she couldn't.  And a friend from Guyana who was a nurse convinced her to try one more time.  And so thankfully, I'm here.  And that woman became my godmother.
Speaker 1: Now I listened to a TED [Technology, Entertainment, Design] talk, in fact just a little while ago where you were describing your aunt and your mother's cousin and some of the other relatives and--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, exactly.  I told--my TED talk (laughter), I thought you were just talking about one in general.  Yes, that was when my mother was living in Buxton [Guyana] with her Aunt Cana [ph.] and her cousin who was a few years older.  And her cousin didn't have the education that my mother did and so she washed clothes to help provide for the family along with Aunt Cana.  I remember when I was in my early teens we went to Guyana to visit, and Aunt Cana was by then near--in her seventies.  She couldn't see as well, but she was just as spry and nimble and alert.  She and my mother's cousin--cousin Gertie [ph.] lived together all of their lives.  And my cousin Gertie whenever I'd go to Guyana she would come and get my clothes no--no matter where I was staying she would take care of that for me.  But when they were growing up, everyone in the family invested a lot in my mother's education.  She was the only one of her siblings who ever left Guyana and came here.  And I think they really saw her as the one who made it out.  The story that I told in the TED talk was of my mother, whenever it rained, Guyana--it got very muddy, you know, Guyana is below sea level.  Cousin Gertie would be charged with carrying her on her back to school so that she wouldn't get muddy before she got to school.  You know, appearance was very important, particularly in a family that tended to clothes, their own clothes needed to always be fresh no matter how few they had.  And I think there was one pair of shoes that was used at school so they wouldn't be messed up walking to and from school.  But that story and that vision in my mind of my mother's cousin carrying her to school never left me because I thought a lot about Cousin Gertie and of the years later when I saw her and she was always lovely to me, always really giving and I could see that was how she was with my mother as well.  I could see that she felt that she was the big sister or the big cousin; and that she sacrificed a lot.
Story_ID: 650403
Speaker 1: Where did you grow up?
Speaker 2: I grew up in New York [New York]. We lived in Brooklyn until I was about eight years old; and then we bought a home in Hollis, Queens [New York], my parents did.  And my--and that's where I lived until I went away to college.  I went to University of Connecticut [Storrs, Connecticut] for three semesters and--
Speaker 1: Now I don't wanna get too--
Speaker 2: Don't go too far.
Speaker 1: --too far--
Speaker 2: You wanna hear about the early years.
Speaker 1: Hollis, Queens, we just interviewed DMC [HistoryMaker Daryl "DMC" McDaniels] on Friday.  And he was in Hollis, Queens.  [HistoryMaker] Russell Simmons.
Speaker 2: Yes, exactly.  Russell Simmons family, yep, yeah.
Speaker 1: A lot of (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I didn't know them then, but yeah.  Hollis was--and in those days I remember when we were living in Brooklyn and most Guyanese were living in Brooklyn, it was a journey.  It felt like a journey going to Queens.  That was the beginning of Long Island [New York].  And so people acted like you went out there you spent the day, you know, it wasn't something you ran out and back to do.  We had a house, we had a garage and a backyard and a front yard, very different from living in apartments.
Speaker 1: Right, right, yeah. Queens is the one borough where you have grass and yard.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  And so as a kid I rode my bike all around the neighborhood, and my friends stayed out.  It was when you don't come in until the street lights come on.  And it was--I remember that more clearly than I do the years of Brooklyn and more warmly I think because of that, because of holidays spent there.  Many of the people in my mother's [Shirley Jones] life that she grew up with, the R.R. Baird, Robert Reuben Baird and his wife [Maude Stephenson-Baird], the headmaster that my mother lived with when she was in high school [Queen's College, Georgetown, Guyana], they often came to stay.  And some of what they call batch mates, people who went to college with my mother, graduated in her year came to visit as well.  And so because they're all teachers in the summer I had school until noon every day 'cause there was someone in the house who felt that I was not gonna run the streets all day long.  So there was always lessons from nine to noon, until lunchtime and then I could go out and play.  I remember that a lot about them, they put a lot of store in education and speaking properly, and reading and being well rounded.  My dad [Eustace Jones] didn't have much education.  He used to say he went to the school of hard knocks and--but he was so well versed in the ways of the world because of his travels, you know, because he'd been so many places and he'd bring back things from--from many places.  And when I got to be about nine or ten years old, he switched to the last ship that he worked on, was the SS United States.  And it was a short run.  They went five days, it was at the time the fastest luxury liner in the world and so it took five days to go from New York to London [England]--to Liverpool [England], Southampton [England] actually.  And so he would do that trip.  They would do Southampton and would stop in Germany, Le Havre [France] and in France, I forget where and then come back.  So he was home every two weeks or so for a couple of weeks.  Before then, he was home every three months.  He was on a ship that went to Brazil and Argentina and back, and that was a much longer run.  But I think as I got older, he felt the need to be home more regularly.  So I remember his coming home with cuckoo clocks from Switzerland and watches and perfumes from France and Champagne and wine, and he'd get wool coats and sweaters from England.  He brought me a bike once from England.  So we'd go to meet him when the ship docked.  I re--this was something also that I remember really fondly, Pier 86 [Hudson River Park, New York, New York] I think it was.  We'd go meet him and he'd come with all of the things that he was bringing and our stops were--we would stop at the meat market and the fish market on 9th Avenue because he would buy meat and fish for the two weeks that he was gone.  And then we'd come home and he would clean all the fish and a portion the meat in meal sized portions so that he would know, you know, there's two weeks' worth until I come back again.  That was a ritual we did often.  I remember also my [maternal] grandmother [Annie Hamer] would bake every Saturday.  She taught me to make homemade bread and sweet breads and then we'd get things and she would make mauby which is a drink made from a bark.  They'd have the bark sent from Guyana.  She'd make mauby and--and a pine drink from pineapple and ginger beer and all on the back porch, it would be there fermenting.  And we'd get black cake from home which was really a British fruitcake, but you pour rum in it for a couple of months and then you eat it at Christmastime so that it's black and gooey by the time you get there.  So a black cake was also what they made wedding cakes out of.  They'd put hard white icing on it.  So I remember a lot of Guyana in Queens and then visiting fairly regularly.  We'd go summers or they'd send me in the summer or during the Christmas holiday until I was sixteen.  And my mother died two years later, that was actually had been the last time we went together as a family.
Speaker 1: Let me go back and ask you about school, your experiences at school.  Now education is a big thing, so you started at St. Peter Claver [St. Peter Claver School, Jamaica, New York]?
Speaker 2: Yes, St. Peter Claver was a school that my mother and another Guyanese woman named Marian Hendricks [ph.]--
Story_ID: 650404
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I don't remember the year, it may have been '58 [1958] that my mother [Shirley Jones] and woman named Marian Hendricks [ph.] from Guyana, two Anglican priests, Father Ebee [ph.] and Father Costello [ph.] and a teacher, Muriel Braithwaite [ph.] from Barbados and one other person started St. Peter Claver [St. Peter Claver School, Jamaica, New York].  It was in Queens [New York].  At first it was in the basement of a church, in their rec center [recreation center].  When I was five, my mother was the teacher in first grade as well.  And so several of--all of those who had kids who were part of the founders just brought their kids to school.  So my mother actually was my--
Speaker 2: It's just interesting, we will have it recorded, but you know, it's interesting they named the school after St. Peter Claver who (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) After, exactly.  I didn't realize that.
Speaker 2: --is the patron saint of slaves.
Speaker 1: Well it makes sense when I think about it.  Father Ebee and Father Costello were--they were two white priests and--and Anglican ministers.  And I guess with these women who were all teachers, and kind of taught in the British system started this school.  So we started in a basement of a church, I don't remember the name of it.  And then by second grade, we moved to a Jewish center that had classrooms.  So Jewish children would go there after school and have Hebrew classes, and we used the school during the day.  So I remember we had to get out by quarter to three every day.  But I stayed there for a couple more years.  I got tired of being in school with my mother.  No matter what I did she would find out immediately, so.
Story_ID: 650405
Speaker 1: I left after that and went to St. Pascal Baylon [St. Pascal Baylon School], which was the parochial school in Hollis [sic. St. Albans, New York] near where we lived.  And then in eighth grade, my parents thought about sending me to boarding school.  I was in seventh grade at the time.  And my father [Eustace Jones] was pushing for me to go to a boarding school in London [England] because he was there twice a month, but the nun who was my seventh grade teacher suggested St. Joseph's--Academy of St. Joseph at Brentwood [New York] because she told my mother [Shirley Jones] you know it's your only child and do you really want her that far away, and so that's when I went out to Brentwood--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --stayed there for high school.
Speaker 2: Okay, so this is a boarding situation? Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes.  It was a day or boarding school, I was there five years.  And it was a really powerful experience for me.  I think my high school years had a bigger effect on me than college or graduate school in terms of shaping who I became as an intellectual person and a spiritual person.  I remember, you know, of course the first year I was there it was really kind of tough because I didn't go home very often.  As the years progressed and I got older, I was able to go home more often just because I said you know, I don't wanna stay here all the time.  So I came home on the weekends.  But what I loved about the school was that I discovered at that school that I was a leader.  I discovered that I was smart.  And I discovered that there was a spirituality that I had that was very prominent in my life and very important to me.  And I really credit being in an all-girls school and being in that school for giving me the opportunity to do that.
Speaker 2: Now, I have two questions, now is this mostly a white school?
Speaker 1: Yes, it was a predominantly white school.
Speaker 2: What proportion, you know, were black students?
Speaker 1: Oh my goodness, there were less than--there were five or six African Americans in the school.
Speaker 2: Out of, out of how many people?
Speaker 1: A few hundred.  My high school class was of about eighty-five kids.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, they had a smaller elementary school and then a larger high school.  There were day students as well, white students who lived in Long Island [New York].
Story_ID: 650406
Speaker 1: Well you mentioned the spirituality--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and I wanna know what, what characterized that, that spirituality. Was it like typical religious belief? Or something (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well it was a Catholic school--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and I found that I had a great calling to understand spiritual issues, although I had a lot of questions also.  And in Catholicism you're really not encouraged to ask a lot of questions.  You're encouraged to take things on faith.  But in my sophomore year, there were three nuns in the school who were different.  One was my English teacher, one was my religion teacher and one was the guidance counselor.  The three of them lived in an experimental convent in Bay Shore [New York].  And this was in the period of time where the church was changing.  So some of the nuns like them had on the more modern habits which were so the front of your hair could show, where the veil went to just about your shoulder and it was long, but not like those of the older habits which were these long veils.  They had the little cone hat and there was something right here (gesture) and it covered all of this (gesture).  The rosary chains were really long and you could hear them clinking as they walked through.  They were formidable in those habits.  These were lighter and shorter and the wo- and these women were younger.  And I remember once going home with them on the weekend because I'd become friends with all of them.  And what an experimental convent is, is they lived in a house.  And as soon as they got off the grounds, you know, Academy of St. Joseph [Brentwood, New York] had some very big grounds and a wall around it, because it also had the postulancy novitiates.  So if you wanted to become a nun, decades before young women would leave the school and just transfer over to become a nun.  But by the time I was in high school the only person who stayed to become a nun was the lay gym teacher.  So, but they had the college on the grounds and they also had a senior citizens home for elderly nuns and our--what we called a chapel, was bigger than the church that wa- that I went to in Queens [New York].  So it was huge and just beautiful, and marble and gold, and stained glass windows and high vaulted ceilings.  And the school was lovely, the grounds were extensive.  The cemetery was there also.  For the nuns, it was the mother house for the St. Joseph's order [Sisters of St. Joseph].  So in those--you know, when I went there, we had periods of silence during the day when, you know, we weren't speaking, the nuns weren't speaking.  We weren't forced to go to Mass every day, but we could go every morning if we wanted to.  But there were a couple of days a week where everyone had to go to Mass.  And we had the woods and it was really fostering a lot of contemplation and spiritual perspective.  And then with the ex- the nuns in the experimental convent, my religion teacher was the one who exposed us to Eastern religions.  So we spent a great deal of time understanding Hinduism and Buddhism, and meditation and that sparked in me a desire to know more about a lot of different religions.  And a quest in my life has been to have--to find the common underpinnings in the world's religions so that I could see the commonality of human beings.  And it's been something that has been a--an important part of my life ever since.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So yes, they were very important to me in that way.
Story_ID: 650407
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite teacher; or who were some of your favorite role models and teachers (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The English teacher, my English teacher in the sophomore year was my favorite.  She was very encouraging of my reading and writing, and my religion teacher was very open minded.  That's what I liked about the teachers, they just being more open minded.  I had the opposite in some experiences as well.  A French teacher, she was not my French teacher, I took Spanish all four years.  But there were a couple of nuns whom I discovered later were pretty prejudiced and I didn't really know that at the time.  It was very much a sheltered environment.  But there was an incident.  I was reading Claude McKay's [sic. Claude Brown] 'Manchild in the Promised Land.'  It was my sophomore year, same year.  That was a pivotal year.  And I lent it to a young woman who was my big sister in the school [Academy of St. Joseph, Brentwood, New York], and she left it in her French class.  So one afternoon I was called to this sister's homeroom and I didn't know why because I didn't have any classes with her.  But I noticed that my junior sister was at the door and the French teacher told her, "You can leave now"; her name was Mary Kay [ph.].  "You can leave now Mary Kay."  And so Mary Kay left, but I saw her hovering down the hall.  So I went into the room, it was just she and I.  And she handed me the book and she says, "Is this yours?"  And I said, "Yes, my name's right there."  And so she opened the book and asked me to read the page out loud.  And I read the page but I was familiar with it, it was when Claude McKay's main character [Sonny] was a little boy and he was playing doctor with a little girl.  So, I was embarrassed reading this out loud and I stopped.  And she just started talking to me about of course I should be ashamed 'cause that's the kind of person I am and--, "I told Reverend Mother we didn't need your kind in this school, gi- bringing this bad influence on our good girls.  And--and get out of my sight. You make me sick."  So after that, she was good friends with the woman who was my Spanish teacher and I noticed I was getting a lot more questions asked in Spanish class and my tests were really graded very red penned.  And then one day, I went up to my room, I was in a big dormitory room with alcoves and then moved to a private room in my last two years.  But my drawers were overturned on the bed and it wasn't folded well enough or my bed was ripped up, it wasn't made well enough.  And--and this was a bit of a campaign for a few weeks.  And I remember telling my mother about it the next time I went home.  And my mother was a teacher and so she gave the benefit of the doubt to teachers.  And she said, "You must be exaggerating.  I can't believe they would do that to you.  Don't make such a big thing of it," and so, I said nothing.  Mary Kay, my junior sister, wrote an article, a book review of the book in the school paper which was her little act of retaliation.  But I was crushed, I'd never really experienced that kind of, of--nobody ever had spoken to me, my parents [Shirley Jones and Eustace Jones] didn't speak to me like that and I'd never seen that before.  This is after three years, I'd been class president every year of my homeroom.  I was--in my senior year I became president of the--the resident council, the boarding school council and I was in clubs, I felt really accepted and liked, and this was a surprise.  Then a couple of months later I noticed the same English teacher, she was monitoring homeroom and she was reading the book.  And then I saw another nun reading the book, and then one day I happened to be up in the dormitory area and the principal came through, Sister Regina Celeste, and she was walking from the elevator down and she stopped and saw me and she called me over.  And she said that she had read the book and she wasn't in agreement with the sisters. She thought they were making too much of it, and that she felt that my only concern was to get a good education; that's what my parents sent me there for.  Very distant, very aloof, but that was her judgment on the matter.  So summertime came, and that's when my mother, who was as I said a teacher, so she was off for the summer, we're both off for a summer and she always had a stack of books that she wanted to read in the summer.  And in August she called me one day into the den and she'd been reading 'Manchild in the Promised Land.'  And she said to me, "I just finished reading this book and I have to apologize to you for not believing you when you told me what happened.  I took their word for it because I didn't think teachers would ever do that to a young person, but I see now what the problem was and it will be taken care of."  So September came, she drove me back to school, moved me into my room and as we're leaving, the nun who had initi- who had said this to me was walking towards me, and I said, "Mom that's the one."  And my mother was of the hat and gloves and purse era.  So she put her purse and she fixed her gloves and she said, "Okay, you stay right here."  And she went over and they had a conversation, didn't last very long, and then my mother called me and we went to the door and she kissed me and she said, "Okay, you have some spending money, call me on Friday and I'll see you next time you come home."  I never knew what the conversation was, but that nun went out of her way to avoid me for the rest of the year.  I remember we were walking towards each other in a long hall and she ducked into a room, she never said a word to me ever after that.
Speaker 1: I wonder what mother said, but (laughter).
Speaker 2: I wish I knew, but it was enough to keep people off me (laughter).
Story_ID: 650408
Speaker 1: Now in light of what your career is about, in terms of media--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and so, what was your exposure to media growing up?  I know--
Speaker 2: Oh, this was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) I know there was a lot of education, and--but did you go to the movie, did you watch television, listen to the radio?
Speaker 2: It was Guyana.  When I was growing up, Guyana didn't get television until the mid-'80s [1980s] and so there were two radio stations and those radio stations provided everything in the country.  And when I was younger, my mother [Shirley Jones], one of her batch mates [from Queen's College, Georgetown, Guyana], was a writer for one of the daily papers and he had a program on the air.  You know, Guyana is such a small country that whenever people came to visit, someone would put them on a program and have them on the air.  So I remember Uncle Basil, Basil Hinds was his name.  He led, he was the head of the American library there and he wrote for one of the papers [The Guyana Annual] and he had a jazz show ['Just Jazz'].  And I came to Guyana once with my 45s [45 rpm record].  And I brought several 45s on the air.  So I had the--I had The Jackson 5, 'I Want You Back.'  And he'd play his song--music and I'd play one of mine and we would talk about them.  So I played that song and he said, "Well you know they sound good, but I don't think they're gonna last very long."  So what was fun was years later coming back, even a few years later and him saying, "I guess I was wrong about that."  But I remember once being asked to be on one of the morning shows and the engineer was a young woman.  And this is when everybody did their own records and they would play--the radio stations in Guyana provided all the entertainment because that was all there was.  So there were--the radio plays from England, these were in seven year cycles.  They were like soap operas on the air.  And then they had classroom on the air so people could learn things who were in the rural parts of the country.  They had the farm report and one other program that stuck out to me was the death announcements.  So this funereal music would come on--an organ playing.  And a gentleman would then recite the names of any Guyanese who had died anywhere in the world, except in Guyana.  So who died in England, who died in New York [New York], who died in Canada.  Back then those were the only places Guyanese went to.  New York, Toronto [Canada] and London [England].  And so radio on the air was on all day long because it was something different, radio plays, Guyanese plays after independence, a lot of programming that Guyanese made themselves, popular music, it was the lifeline.  I remember one time we took a trip into the interior which is what it was called going from the country down into the remote parts.  And on a big ferry boat that was on the Essequibo River and then people would come on to the boat.  It would start and then it wouldn't stop, it would slow down.  So folks would take a launch from the bush and they would transfer their produce to go to the market and the boat would slow down so they could jump on.  And I could hear the radio from stop to stop out in the interior.  Once cousin Gertie [ph.] and I were walking from our house to go play bingo and we were concerned because we would miss 'Dr. Paul' who was on in the evening.  But everybody was listening, and because it was always warm weather there were no windows with glass, it was all shutters.  People were outside and we heard the whole program walking to bingo.  So I realized--it fired my imagination how important radio was and how much people could visualize and learn, and be connected through radio.  So that's what sparked my interest in working in radio.
Story_ID: 650409
Speaker 1: As you were a senior in high school [Academy of St. Joseph, Brentwood, New York], did you envision yourself working in, in radio?
Speaker 2: Not then.  It was interesting.  I don't remember.  I didn't know what I wanted to be when I first went away to college. I knew that I liked speaking, I liked leading, I liked reading, and I liked the arts.  But college, by then my mother [Shirley Jones] was very sick.  And nowadays, you know, when my daughter [Makara Bey] was going to colleges we looked at a lot of different colleges we visited.  Back then, I don't think we knew much about visiting colleges, we didn't, my family didn't.
Speaker 1: What about counseling, what kind of counseling did you get?
Speaker 2: You know I didn't get very good counseling in college.  I--as I look back--
Speaker 1: You mean in high school?
Speaker 2: In high school.  As I look back now either it was because my mother was too ill to really be active in it, but what I remember was after I took the Regents exam [Regents Examination], I did pretty well.  And so I started getting offers from schools.  You got a lot of mail from colleges.  And the way we picked University of Connecticut [Storrs, Connecticut] was because it offered me the most money.
Speaker 1: Now a Regents scholarship is what you received?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Which is quite an honor and--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, I--I understand that now.  When you're in a situation where everyone is taking the Regents and several people are getting scholarships, it--I didn't realize that at the time.
Speaker 1: So this is something that happens in New York, it doesn't happen in other places.  But the State of New York has what they call they the Regents--
Speaker 2: Has the Regents, exactly.
Speaker 1: --scholarship for those who are.
Speaker 2: Yep.  As a matter of fact when I took the Regents I just checked all of the, you know, they ask which subjects you wanted to get a scholarship in or which areas, I checked everything.  I even got a nursing scholarship and I had no interest in being a nurse.  So, we just picked the school that offered us the most money.
Story_ID: 650410
Speaker 1: This is University of Connecticut [Storrs, Connecticut].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Otherwise known as UConn, right?
Speaker 2: UConn in stores, yes.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was not the best choice for me because I left a school [Academy of St. Joseph, Brentwood, New York] with a graduating class of eighty-two students where I had been class president for three or four years, and president of the resident council and I remember that last year in school, I was in several clubs and I actually removed my name from being qualified to be president of two of the clubs because there was a third I wanted to be president of.  So I was really a big fish in a small pond.  And I left there and went to UConn and was a minnow in the ocean.  So between the size of the school, it was huge, it was cold, it was far from the city [New York, New York].  It was similar to what I was experiencing in high school, but far from the city so I didn't go home or anywhere often.  And my mother [Shirley Jones] was very ill.  And so it was a tough year for me.  I lost my bearings.  I lost my scholarship by the end of the year.  I just didn't know who I was or what I wanted and I discovered all kinds of things.
Story_ID: 650411
Speaker 1: Was there an ac- an activist atmosphere on campus?  This is 1970, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, 1970, '71 [1971] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you got, you're just in high school is where Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] is assassinated, Robert Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Vietnam War protests--
Speaker 2: I remember when--
Speaker 1: --civil rights activism.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  I remember when Dr. King was killed 'cause--
Speaker 1: Nixon's [President Richard Milhous Nixon] president by '70 [1970].
Speaker 2: --I was a sophomore in high school [Academy of St. Joseph, Brentwood, New York] and we were going into my homeroom for study hall and we had the news on.  And--and it was--people didn't know what to say.  I was crying because I knew what King meant to our people and I knew what King meant in our family.  But there was one other African American student in the class and everyone else was not that phased.  As a matter of fact, there, a young woman was like (makes sound), "About time."  Just under her breath, but you know, and I realized, you know, the--my teacher was sympathetic and there were some who were.  I remember in high school, yes anti-war and the Black Power movement was coming to the fore.  And so there were some of my white peers who were active and interested.  And we had one club where we went in to Brentwood [New York] and did reading with kids, it was a--kind of a big--not big, but in comparison Latino and African American community, and so we worked with some of the students there.  That was the club that I was president of, it was called the interracial council [Catholic Interracial Council].  But, the big question for a lot of my peers was, for those who felt that they were conscious and committed, how can I marry my interest in helping disadvantaged people in the inner city with the fact that I like that we have a boat and we belong in a country club and I live out here.  'Cause I remember conversations about this with some of my peers and some of their parents, some of their mothers who were politically active.  My junior sister--a friend of mine--she was a year older than me.  She and I were very good friends.  Her what--my senior--I think it was, I know I was home, I was supposed to go to her house that weekend, and it was the weekend that her older sister, who had graduated already, and some friends had broken into a draft board and poured blood on draft files and had gotten arrested.  It was in The New York Times.  And so my friend Joan [ph.] called and said, "You can't come this weekend."  So there were people who were politically active in a number of ways.
Story_ID: 650412
Speaker 1: Now my parents though, while they were very aware and very committed to helping in Guyana's independence earlier on, were wary of Black Power movement.  They were cautious because they had done some much to assimilate, because they had done so much to leave a country where they had very little future, or they thought at the time, to come here.
Speaker 2: It is often people raise, even in history conferences, the differences between black people from the Caribbean and black folks from the United States-- Yes.
Speaker 1: --and did there--is this like a divide, even in Hollis, Queens [New York] amongst the Caribbean blacks and--
Speaker 2: We didn't, we didn't have many African American friends.  Our world was revolved around West Indians and Guyanese.  You know, I don't remember, one or two.  My father [Eustace Jones] had an African American friend, he was from Louisiana, who worked ships with him was his best friend.  But the--but then no, we didn't really--she didn't do much with Americans.  Remember even working at St. Peter Claver [St. Peter Claver School, Jamaica, New York], it was all West Indians.  At the time now, it's a very American--African American school in Queens, but back then.  So, I know that--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just wondered if they didn't trust the, you know, the political activities of African Americans because of the distance between them?
Speaker 2: You know, I remember hearing Guyanese saying if they had been in this country as long as black Americans had been, they would've been running it by now.  That was the prevailing thought.  But as I got older and studied with men like John Henrik Clarke and the Afrocentrism movement, I realized that in the Caribbean and in Guyana, the black population outnumbered the white population.  And so it was my mother [Shirley Jones] saw civil servants and teachers who were African ancestored and her college friend [Basil Hinds] wrote in the local papers, and it was her peers who were at the radio station.  And so because they were there and because early on she could see more of the--not so much a transference of power, but at least people of her generation being put on the police force, were the nurses and the teachers and so I think that's where that attitude came from.  And then I don't think that the severity of American slavery was the same in Guyana, as long as it was here.  I'm not sure, but I don't think so.  So I think that there are differences in the black experience from the Caribbean and here.  And so it may have been a bit unfair of them to say that, had we'd been living here as long.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know that's a debate that goes on today even, you know.  A lot of the reasons you gave are the reasons of why.
Speaker 2: Although what that did spark though was that you know the Pan Africanist movement, the first Pan-African Congress and Garvey [Marcus Garvey] and a lot of those men are West Indian.
Speaker 1: Schomburg [Arturo Alfonso Schomburg]?
Speaker 2: Yes, they're Caribbean people, so I think that seeing yourself as being independent, seeing slave revolts in their countries and bringing that with them to the states is what helped to move the whole feeling of Afrocentricity in this country.
Speaker 1: Right.  Okay, so at the University of Connecticut [Storrs, Connecticut] you're not doing well.
Speaker 2: No (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And did, did you last the whole year?
Speaker 2: No, I lasted my freshman year.  My mother died in the, in November of my sophomore year; and I left school after that.
Story_ID: 650413
Speaker 1: Okay, so was, was there any particular bad experience at UConn [University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut] that made you wanna leave or just?
Speaker 2: No, there were no bad experiences there.  It was just overwhelming.  It was huge.  So not only was--I was from a very small all-girls school [Academy of St. Joseph, Brentwood, New York] to a huge school with people from everywhere on a huge campus in cold weather.  This was also not just that I was around a lot of white people, but you know, before I--as we were filling out the papers to go, one of the things they asked in the papers was, "Do you wanna live in a dorm with, you know, other black people?"  They said it in a different kind of way, but--and I remember this conversation.  My mother [Shirley Jones], my godmother were there and they said, "You don't wanna do that.  They have that dorm out on the edge of campus far from everything.  You wanna stay on campus," and so--well when I got there, what it meant was that in the dorms they had a floor where it was all black people.  So I was in an integrated part of the dorm, but not very integrated, which was kind of what I was used to.  So being around a lot of black people was different for me as well.  And it was different in a lot of ways.  This was also a lot of drugs, so I discovered pot [marijuana] and LSD, and mescaline, and I--I was a hippie, you know, in a kind of sense and making friends with different kinds of people.  It was the beginning of my being able to--to do that.  I never dated until I, you know, before I got into college so I was kind of awkward around guys.  It was a lot, it was a lot.
Speaker 1: Did, did you have a big Afro?
Speaker 2: Kind of big, yeah, yeah, exactly.  So I was braiding it at night and then Afro pick and pulling it out, and yeah.  There were some friends I made, it was--it was good in that regard.  But I think the uneasiness of my home life really predominated how I was doing.  And then feeling at sea after having been very known and understood or felt that I was understood.  At least I knew where everyone stood in, in high school.
Story_ID: 650414
Speaker 1: You ended up going to Antioch [Antioch College; Antioch University], right, in Maryland, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, after UConn [University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut], uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And how, how long a gap was it before, you know?
Speaker 2: Okay. I left UConn the end of my third semester.  My mother [Shirley Jones] died in November and I went home.  And I lived in Queens [New York] and I was working in a health food store.  That was a big change in my life because--because of my mother's illness, she had kidney disease.  And I noticed that they took her off more and more foods, and she got sick.  They started with no white flour, no sugar, no meat, and more vegetables.  And because we weren't really aware of whole grains and cooking foods, we would get vegetables and boil them.  You know, the only vegetables that my family really knew were a lot about were West Indian vegetables which were mostly root vegetables.  So we would overcook broccoli and they said, "Do vegetable juices."  We'd buy canned carrot juice and you know, we just weren't aware.  And so I got a job in a health food store so that I could learn all of the, that and then I became a vegetarian, and it really changed--that was another change in my life at the time.  And my thought was to go back to Guyana, really I wanted to go home.  And so I moved in with a cousin who was living in Washington [D.C.] and he was managing a couple of fast food restaurants and he got me a job at a McDonald's near his home.  And my plan was to live with him, save some money, get enough plane fare to go back to Guyana.  And I wasn't sure who I was gonna stay with but I was trying to work that out.  And one morning I had the early shift at McDonald's and this young man came in, his name was Benito Rivera [ph.].  He had been tripping all night and he came in for breakfast and we started talking.  And he told me he went to this school called Antioch, it was part of the University Without Walls system, and he said, you know, "If you didn't make it in any other kind of school, this was the great school for you to do it," and they were really much more politically active and aware, and you know, there was no dorms or anything like that, it was--.  And I realized that I didn't know how to do anything that could be helpful in a developing country, so I decided to apply and I got in.  And I said, "Let me stay and get a degree, and then if I still wanna go back I would."  So that's how I got into Antioch.  It was the campus in Washington D.C., they had a law school [Antioch School of Law; University of the District of Columbia David A. Clarke School of Law] there as well.  So they had a campus in Washington, one in Columbia, Maryland and one in Baltimore, Maryland.  And in each city you could major in different things.  So I--at the time wanted--thought I wanted to be a teacher and do early childhood education.  So I moved to Columbia, Maryland.
Speaker 1: Now that's interesting, 'cause I come from Dayton [Ohio] and the Yellow Springs campus [Antioch College, Yellow Springs, Ohio]--
Speaker 2: Yes, is right there.
Speaker 1: --the original campus is twenty miles away.
Speaker 2: Yep, I've never been to Yellow Springs.  I did all of my Antioch years in Baltimore and Washington.
Speaker 1: Now I was aware of the law school, but I didn't know about the undergrad school.  And it didn't last long did it--the undergrad school for Antioch?
Speaker 2: About fifteen years.
Speaker 1: Fifteen?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was there for a while.  They had campuses, there was one in New England, there was an American Indian [Native American] campus out in the Southwest, there was a campus on the West Coast, and they were also tied to Yellow Springs in that you could do a semester abroad.  I never really got it together to do that, but I did have one friend who did.  But I did early childhood education in Columbia for a year and then realized that while I came from a mother and grandmother [Bey's maternal grandmother, Annie Hamer] and a family of teachers, I wasn't a teacher in that sense.  I loved the arts.
Story_ID: 650415
Speaker 1: And in, in Baltimore [Maryland], the theater department was a theater.  It was called the Theatre Project, and so that's--I moved to Baltimore in order to major in theater.
Speaker 2: Okay, now where was the theater located in Baltimore?
Speaker 1: Right across from the Meyerhoff [Joseph Meyerhoff Symphony Hall], which is the lyric theater on Preston Street, and the Antioch campus [Antioch College; Antioch University] was on St. Paul Street or Calvert [Street], one of those.  So it was kind of downtown near Mount Vernon [Baltimore, Maryland].  What's the--Peabody was nearby as well, Peabody Institute [Baltimore, Maryland], the music school.  And I got an apartment and I really loved--I loved studying there.  The Theatre Project was more of an experimental theater so they brought in troupes from different parts of the country and the world, and then we had our classes there as well.  And then I'd go for my other classes at--at the Antioch building there.
Speaker 2: That sounds exciting--
Speaker 1: It was.
Speaker 2: --now any particular exciting memories from those days in the theater, any roles you played or any?
Speaker 1: You know, we formed a dance company and a theater company that traveled to some different cities with some of the other improvisational companies that traveled, and so that was fun for me.  And then when other companies came to Baltimore, they would--members of the companies would stay with some of us, those of us that had our own apartments.  So, I remember there was one called the Iowa Theatre Lab that I really liked working with.  They--they came several times while I was there and I loved their style of working.  They encouraged me so much around acting and improvisational acting that I took a class that required us to create an outside internship or a practicum which was more like a practicum.  So I devised one based on theater games and on the play 'Short Eyes' had come out, which became a film ['Pinero'] about Miguel Pinero, the writer and how he developed it in prison.  So my idea was to develop a theater workshop at the Baltimore City Jail [Baltimore, Maryland], and they had a program there called the CASH program [Confirmed Addicts Seeking Help].  So these were for people who had been arrested who were--didn't have bail--were not out on bail and they lived above the gym--gymnasium at the Baltimore City Jail in an experimental program where they could do group therapy.  They lived and slept there, and had therapy classes.  So my workshop was part of their therapy.
Story_ID: 650416
Speaker 1: I was in the Moorish Science Temple [Moorish Science Temple of America] by this time in Baltimore [Maryland].  And so--
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now how did that happen--how did you get involved with Moorish Science (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I started to tell you about meeting a brother from Ant- he was in Antioch [Antioch College; Antioch University] with me, was a Hebrew Israelite and then taking this other class where I went to Hagerstown [Maryland].  As a matter of fact, it was an institutional analysis class as I said, and we were doing some interviewing and I was at the prison [Baltimore City Jail, Baltimore, Maryland] and my teacher asked me--wanted to introduce me to one of the inmates who we thought was really kind of bright and promising, and to do my interview with him.  And so I interviewed him and I asked him, "So what are your plans for when you get out of prison?"  He said, "You know, I really want to be an actor."  And I, you know, on the outside was you know, "That's great," and on the inside like, you are never gonna be an actor, in my mind.  It was Charles Dutton [Charles S. Dutton] who did get out and become an actor, yeah.
Speaker 2: And a top flight actor.
Speaker 1: Exactly, exactly.  I got to see him again on Broadway and you know, and saw him on television and so, yeah it taught me about making light of people's dreams.  With enough determination, folks can do anything.  And so when I learned from these inmates that I was interviewing about the Moorish movement I was curious and one of my friends in Baltimore was married to someone who was in the Moorish Science Temple.  And I bugged her and bugged her and bugged her, and bugged her to take me.  And she actually wasn't going ve- she wasn't going; her husband went from time to time, but she went with me and I loved it.  And I stayed, she stayed, our other friend, we all stayed for years.
Speaker 2: Now, now--
Speaker 1: And I got very active in the--in the Moorish movement.
Story_ID: 650417
Speaker 1: What is the Moorish Science Temple [Moorish Science Temple of America] anyway?
Speaker 2: The Moorish Science Temple was--was the first Islamic oriented organization in the United States.  It was founded in 1913 by a man named Timothy Drew, who became known as Noble Drew Ali.  And the emphasis of the temple was not so much the religion of Islam as it was understanding ourselves as African ancestored people with a nationality.  And so we knew that we had a history that predated slavery.  We knew that most of us were from northwest Africa, most of us who were in the states.  And it took me a long time to join the temple because I was curious about having Guyanese parents [Shirley Jones and Eustace Jones], how that fit in.  So I was able to travel, see, study the route from West Africa to South America and the Caribbean and to the Americas.  But what, it was similar to the Garvey [Marcus Garvey] movement also in that we understood that we were not defined by our color, but that a nation of people is defined by its land, its people and its laws.  And we also studied a lot about the formation of the United States from the [U.S.] Constitution and particularly the Civil War period.  And knew that at the time of the formation of the United States, there were freed African people, they were not slaves, they were people of African descent who were living here.  The first international country to recognize the United States, the thirteen colonies as a country was the Kingdom of Morocco, which was bigger than the country of Morocco at the time.  And so these were dark-skinned people from northwest Africa who lived all through that area.  And so we really spent a lot of time looking at the formation of the Union, what that meant and how black people--African ancestored people predated on this continent the coming of slaves.  We read a lot about--from Ivan Van Sertima, who was a Guyanese, who wrote a book called 'They Came Before Columbus' ['They Came Before Columbus: The African Presence in Ancient America'].  And looking at the Olmec heads in Mexico and some of the evidences of the people, the indigenous people seeing African people.  You can't make art out of something you've never seen before.  And so these heads are clear African features.  So the Moo- Moorish Science Temple encouraged me and helped me to study who we were as a people throughout the Americas and our role in the formation of the Constitution and also in the Civil War and the Emancipation Proclamation, and that was really the emphasis of a lot of our study.  So it was religious study on the--on the religious side.  We did study some of Islam, but really we studied more metaphysics.  We studied more of what you would study if you were in the Masonic order.  We looked at those founding fathers who understood who African ancest- ancestored people were.
Story_ID: 650418
Speaker 1: I'll give you an example.  When I was living in Maryland at that time, the driver's license had a race code on it: one, two, three, four.  Black, Negro of African ancestry; white or Caucasian; Spanish speaking; and then American Indian [Native American] or other.  And at the time, one of the things that we learned in the temple [Moorish Science Temple of America] was that people are not defined by color.  That white and black mean other things.  And so the term black was put upon us when we were reduced to less than human, three fifths, the three fifths clause in the First Amendment--the first article [Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3] of the [U.S.] Constitution, and also in Leviticus, what is written on the Liberty Bell about what procla- what emancipation means, returning people to their family and to their nations meaning their name and their culture.  So our leaders in the temple then took that--some of that information and some of the historical information around us as a nation of people and went to the head of the DMV for the State of Maryland [Maryland Department of Motor Vehicles; Maryland Department of Transportation Motor Vehicle Administration], who happened to be in one of the orders.  And by the time they came out of that meeting, we got the designation of white on the driver's license because he also knew that white didn't mean European people, white meant a freed person and we were able to prove constitutionally who we were and what the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments did and did not do.  All of this was towards pushing a case into the [U.S.] Supreme Court.  So at the time, we--if you hear Moor- Moors talk about they don't pay taxes, that's something a lot of Moors say.  What we were doing was claiming a large number of exemptions so that taxes would not be taken out because since we're not citizens why are--why are we charged taxes.  And our plan, at this particular temple was to continue to take out our taxes and hold them in escrow so that when folks started complaining that we weren't paying taxes, we could show the good faith that we've been taking them out.  But what we want to challenge is how nothing has reversed the three fifths clause.  The Thirteenth Amendment frees us, Fourteenth Amendment makes us citizens and the Fifteenth [Fifteenth Amendment] is the right to vote, I'm getting them confused now.  But, nothing removed us from the less than human status, which is why our voting racks--rights need to be reinitiated every so often.  I think when they first came it was every twenty-five years for us.  But when a person is a citizen, their right to vote is--should be automatic.  So, we did this for a while but not everyone was, you know, when you get a paycheck and you're getting all your paycheck, some folks wanted to spend the money and did.  And so by the time the IRS [Internal Revenue Service] decided they'd had enough of this, they charged people who--and some of the folks in the case had bought new cars and put extensions on their homes and other--others of us had put it in escrow but it wasn't enough, but it did bring the case forward.  We got to the third cour- circuit court [Circuit Court for Baltimore County] with this, challenging this, but did not get to the Supreme Court.  But the purpose of this was not to keep the money, the purpose of this was to bring up the case of both who we are as citizens and reparations.
Story_ID: 650419
Speaker 1: The background on the reparations piece. After the Civil War, what it was to have been was in stages, so not only would white people have been paid for their loss of property, but we were to have been paid for our years in servitude.  Now, this got watered down and translated to forty acres and a mule.  But, in the Emancipation Proclamation, which was a very large document that was delivered in three different parts by [President] Abraham Lincoln.  The first part says that those states who do not show up to the next meeting of [U.S.] Congress would be declared in rebellion from the Union.  The way that the Moors [Moorish Science Temple of America] define the Union was this body of people of African descent and people of European descent forming this country.  Because remember, we knew that there had been African ancestored people here who were not slaves.  The--so then in December 1st, which was the big part, the largest part of the proclamation, Lincoln talked about his plan for freeing the slaves.  So it was not just emancipation.  He talked about how you can't just free people and leave them where they are.  They would be then living right next door to the people who had had them in bondage; how would that work?  He talked about you--us moving into the interior of the country because the United States hadn't extended all the way to California, so that there were states that were still in formation.  And for every sixty thousand people there would be one representative in Congress.  We would form states and then have an interior region where we could build our own communities.  And the third part would be how the government would both pay for the loss of property from white people and pay us.  And he talked about how the population of the United States would grow over the next thirty or forty years, immigration from other countries would help build the population, would help build the number of people that would be there to work and pay off--paying folks for that.  The first state to go and ask for reparations was Maryland based on this conversation, but then Lincoln was assassinated and none of this came into existence.  Some of the money was used to build the railroads, some to purchase, I think it was Alaska.  When we got into the 20th century some of it was translated into creating through social security and some of the other government programs there was money there for--for that, but it was never used for reparations.  I'm giving a very watered down explanation on something that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) This, this--
Speaker 1: --that people have studied for decades.
Speaker 2: Yeah but it sounds pretty thorough as, as a, you know--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --as an explanation of Moorish (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes.  So this was--
Story_ID: 650420
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This was--became the foundation of my life.  This understanding of who I am as a human being, as a Moorish woman, as a cultured woman, and we use the term Moorish loosely or to cover a large area.  I know now people can go to ancestry.com or wherever and find out which country or region they were, but remember we're talking about the map looked differently a hundred years ago.  The map of Africa looked differently a hundred years ago.  The map of Africa and the United States looked differently two hundred years ago.  And so, you know, we studied a lot about the Moors that left there and went into Spain and all of the wondrous things they did there in the late--when did I leave, the temple [Moorish Science Temple of America], it might have been, yeah, in the late '70s [1970s], a group of us did a trip to Morocco.  We reversed the slave route, so we did Portugal, Spain, and Morocco.  And looking at the evidences of what Africans had done there and in Morocco, and I remember we had the brothers wore fezzes, which were like what Moors wore.
Speaker 2: Kind of red--
Speaker 1: Yes, they were the higher ones.  When you go to Morocco you can get a little short one in a souvenir shop.  And we were at breakfast once in one of the hotels and I was having breakfast with a British couple, they were at the table next to me and they asked, where did the men get those fezzes, because they were seeing the short ones, but they--they didn't know what souvenir shop we got the others.  I said, "Those aren't souvenirs, they were made for them and that's what they wear all the time."  And they asked me about it and I spoke to them about who we were as Moorish people and I remembered this line exactly, because they said to me, you know, "The trouble we have with the colored people in England is that they leave the West Indies and they come to England and they expect to get everything that English people get."  And the way she phrased it, it was like she was talking to another white person.  She was talking to someone that she wasn't considering as someone less than her as a black person.  I looked the way I look now.  So it really helped me to see, like Spike Lee did in the 'Malcolm X' movie where--when he was in prison and learning what the definitions of white and black were, and what that meant.  It took a long time, it took over a year for me to really understand that I could define myself and see myself in different ways other than in the definition of a black person or a Negro.  This is not discounting who we are as a--in our culture, but it is helping me to know that our culture goes far beyond what we have been able to create here in this country.  And I think a lot of what happens to us as African ancestored people happens because of what we have lost and have not yet regained is a connection to a communal land, a communal set of laws and I don't mean laws like the [U.S.] Constitution, I mean the ways in which people of other countries or other nationalities can go back several generations and say our people do this and our people do that.  Some of us who have studied Afrocentrism can do that.  But the majority of our people in this country don't see Africa as our home, don't see Africa as the home of all of humanity.  We used to say that there's one race, the human race and any subdivisions come through nations of people.  What folks would say tribes that have now become countries.  So that has helped me with a perspective on life and it also has made me, I think that most African ancestored people have a, a, a dual cultural way of living.  We look at the way mass culture does things and then we look at the way our people do things.  We understand things from a Eurocentric perspective and then we understand things from a black perspective.  I would say for those in the Moorish movement, we would say that we do it three ways.  We look at things from a Eurocentr- Eurocentric perspective; we look at things from a black perspective; and then we understand ourselves also as Moorish people.
Story_ID: 650421
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you, you're, you're still affiliated with the Moorish Science Temple [Moorish Science Temple of America]?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head) I don't go to the temple.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No I'm not, but I understand nationality's not something that has to do with a building.
Speaker 1: Okay. The--
Speaker 2: I don't think I can go to a Moorish Science Temple now.  I think that--I don't know for a fact, but--and I'm close with some of the people that I studied with and I know that there are some Moors who are really digging into continuing to understand who we are.  And then just as in some churches or some places, there are people who are like cults.  So, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. So, now so you met your husband [Musa Bey (ph.)] in, around--was this around the same time? In 1970 (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, he was in the Moorish Science Temple as well--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and he was from Baltimore [Maryland].
Story_ID: 650422
Speaker 1: Well at Antioch [Antioch College; Antioch University], who would you consider to be a, a mentor or, or were there anybody there? Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Two, there are two teachers that I had that I remember now.  One was the woman, her name was Doris Hall, and she ended up--she was running Antioch.  She was a powerful, powerful, Dr. Hall, she's a powerful woman, smart and political, and a great leader and administrator.  What I remember about her is that she had been married, her husband died in Vietnam and she had a son.  And then there was another teacher that I had named Al Engelman.  And he was from Germany I believe and as a child was in a concentration camp and moved here.  And he taught more of the institutional analysis philosophy, those kinds of--but he also traveled to Africa regularly.  He was a member of a village there.  He had been named an honorary member of a tribe.  And so besides teaching at Antioch, he would bring and sell African art, sculptures and use the money to put young people from that tribe and village through school.  So I went to his house once and it was covered--and I mean you could barely walk through, there were sculptures everywhere.  And by then, and that was in the late '70s [1970s], he had already put twenty-five students through college from the money that he was making selling art.  And there was one other teacher whose name I don't remember.  I remember--I remember I told you that I had created this class where--it was at the Baltimore City Jail [Baltimore, Maryland] and I was in the Moorish Science Temple [Moorish Science Temple of America], so it meant I had a turban and I wore long clothes.  We wore what was prescribed through Islam, although my face wasn't covered.  And I--my first class at the jail, I was surprised to see that Al Engelman came with me, Doris Hall who was the head of the school, and my teacher, and they didn't do that for anybody else's internship and I was kind of surprised, I didn't really understand why.  I can imagine though from their perspective because I was in the men's side, not the women's side doing--this is where this CASH program [Confirmed Addicts Seeking Help] was.  And I think they wanted to see me do it.  And we went into the prison, and you know, we had to kind of get searched and you know, this program was above the gym so we were inside the prison.  And when we went in I gathered everyone, we put mats out.  We did some physical exercises and did some theater games and then talked afterwards.  That was a three credit course.  At the end of that semesters--at that semester, I got ten credits for that course.  So apparently it was something--yeah, it was something different and it was something great and I did it for a year, I did it for two semesters.  I stopped when it dawned on me that I was going into the men's prison twice a week.  And it may be dangerous.  Didn't occur to me for a year.
Story_ID: 650423
Speaker 1: I have a note here that you had a friend called Nell Merlino? Who is a--yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.  I actually didn't meet Nell until she went to Antioch [Antioch College; Antioch University].  We met when we graduated.  Nell's best friend and one of my very good friends were roommates for a while at a house in Ellicott City in Maryland, and we all moved back to New York [New York] after we graduated and I met Nell then.  And she and I have stayed friends over the years.  She is very active in women's rights.  She actually created Take Our Daughters to Work Day [Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day].  She was hired by the Ms. Foundation [Ms. Foundation for Women].  There had been a study that had come out by a Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] professor that had said that girls tend to experience a drop in self-esteem at around age nine or ten that didn't really come up again.  So when they were in school at around that age they would now--they would stop being more independent, start deferring to the boys in the class or not raising their hands as much.  So, Gloria Steinem, who Nell mu- knew asked her to come up with something that would help address that.  Nell's specialty was creating public movements or public initiatives that would address social issues.  She was a communications expert.  And she actually had led the communications team when Hillary Clinton [Hillary Rodham Clinton] went to China.  So she remembered her father [Joseph P. Merlino], who was a state senator in New Jersey, growing up with him being in politics.  And he had--they did a testimonial for him and she remembered all of the people talking about him throughout his life and all the people in the room who were role models for her, and came up with the idea that what had put her on this path was seeing role models.  What had put me on the path in radio was seeing role models as a young person.  And so she thought of this idea of people in professions bringing young people to work.
Speaker 1: I, I did it myself. So--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, uh-huh.  Yeah, she told me she was talking to her--the person who hired her at the Ms. Foundation and Gloria Steinem came through and said, "What are you all talking about?"  And Nell had created a one sheet about Take Your Daughters To Work Day, and she said--she explained it to her.  Gloria looked at the page, took the pen, crossed out the Y and made it Take Our Daughters to Work Day, and said, "I'm going to a lunch now with Walter Anderson who does Parade magazine," the editor of Parade that was in all the newspapers across the country.  "He's gonna ask me what we're working on, I'm gonna tell him this," and he did--she did, and he did a story on it.  And back then that was when fax machines, you'd put this roll of paper in and so that was all they had, no computers, just phones and fax machine, and they put the--the address and when this article came out, it gathered so much momentum for Take Our Daughters To Work Day that it was a national phenomenon in a short amount of time.  But you know, they remembered thinking it would only be, you know, maybe in New York and a couple of places; and it took off.
Story_ID: 650424
Speaker 1: Now you also, you worked in a place called Clothes Horse [The Clothes Horse, Inc., Baltimore, Marlyand] for Lilyan Alberts [Lilyan F. Alberts], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That was before then.  That was in Baltimore [Maryland] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Before then, okay, yeah, right, right.
Speaker 2: That was in Baltimore while I was in grad school.  Lil had a store on Read Street called The Clothes Horse, and it was clothing.  She was--I loved her store.  She had books and cookbooks and woks and steamers and clothes, and some music and cards, and I worked there during grad school.
Speaker 1: So you went to grad school at Antioch [Antioch College; Antioch University]?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you went right through?
Speaker 2: I went right through.  I went right through.  It was in my second year of grad school that I got a job at WEAA [WEAA Radio, Baltimore, Maryland].  And so when I graduated, I just moved in there full time.
Story_ID: 650425
Speaker 1: Now this is at Morgan State [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland], right?
Speaker 2: Yes, Morgan State owned and ran WEAA [WEAA Radio, Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It had a listenership almost to D.C. [Washington, D.C.], um-hm.
Speaker 1: So were you an on air personality?
Speaker 2: I was.  I was on air Monday through Friday, six to ten [o'clock].  The program director at the station at the time was Kweisi Mfume, who later became the head of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  He started this two way talk show which was a radio call in show.  And it became really popular and he decided to run for city council [Baltimore City Council] and won twice, and then ran for [U.S.] Congress and won several times.  So that station was a launch pad for a number of people, but especially him I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it was a really active community station, was music based.  We did all kinds of black music.  But in between we would talk about current events or talk about history.  We'd do prerecorded programs on famous people in black history, and on the music side and culture side, and politics.  And so it was my most favorite job that paid the least (laughter).
Story_ID: 650426
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite like guest or, or, or production [at WEAA Radio, Baltimore, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Oh I remember once Earth, Wind and Fire was in town, and we got an interview with them.  They came in the morning and the station was in one of the university buildings, Holmes Hall [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] at the time.  And we had a really great interview with three or four of the members, and was in the morning we got to talk about, you know, their emphasis--their emphasis for the music and their themes, how they have this whole cultural, spiritual theme to it, and they let me know that it was mostly Maurice [Maurice White] that was the thought behind all of that.  But it was so in keeping with what I'd learned in high school [Academy of St. Joseph, Brentwood, New York], what I continued to do throughout college.  I think I stopped being a Catholic by the time I left that high school and just explored a number of different religions.  I did Self-Realization Fellowship for about a year or two.  This was started by Yogananda, Paramahansa Yogananda.  And it was mail order kind of thing.  But then I learned about karma and in the Moorish Science Temple [Moorish Science Temple of America] we studied different religions and we studied metaphysics and so by this time, it was really a very important part of my life in how I viewed the world.  And so, that was a wonderful interview, I really enjoyed that.  And I just loved being on the air in the mornings.  I felt so connected to everyone.  At the time, my show was the first show, it wasn't on twenty-four hours then, starting at six o'clock in the morning.  So I would open the station and fire everything up, and I started doing a program from 6 to 6:15 called 'The Meeting Place' [ph.], which was just a meditation and visualization.  I would say some affirmations, people would recite them at home, just to kind of start the morning.  And I remember being in that dark studio and feeling people around the city listening.  I loved that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's why I love communications.
Story_ID: 650427
Speaker 1: Now did you teach any at Morgan State [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: I did.  I taught in the telecommunications department, I taught a broadcasting class.  And I learned very early on that I had to bring some history and current events into the class.  I had a class full of people who--who said they wanted to be on air and wanted to be broadcasters, but they didn't really know a lot about current events or history, so we would start the class.  I ended up getting a world map and making a game of having people go up and identify where capitals were and where countries were.  It was surprising, you know, that folks would think they could talk about places they knew nothing about, but it helped.  And then current events, and we would match the current event things they were hearing on the radio and the news and then finding where it was in the world.
Speaker 1: Now this is an aspect, I've actually heard black radio stations and I focus on them more than the others.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I've heard people on air who couldn't pronounce the name of the countries and that sort of thing.  Now this is something that, you know--
Speaker 2: It's a problem.
Speaker 1: --it's a useful exercise what you are doing--
Speaker 2: Yes it is.
Speaker 1: --a very useful exercise.
Speaker 2: Especially now, you know, when I watch--I don't know if they do geography in school anymore, so.
Speaker 1: I mean this may be a problem in country western stations or, or some other kind of pop culture station, but I know--yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think it's a problem in our education system (laughter), yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Where people don't--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they don't know.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 650428
Speaker 1: So this is like, you started in 1979 right, at Morgan State [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And I stayed until 1984.
Speaker 1: Okay. And you go to WJZ-TV [Baltimore, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Yes, WJZ.
Speaker 1: Why television?
Speaker 2: At the time I thought what I wanted to do was get to the network, come back to New York [New York] in the network and I wasn't quite sure how.  But I knew that I enjoyed being on the air in the morning and my last year [at WEAA Radio, Baltimore, Maryland] they switched me from the morning until the afternoon and it was not the same audience, not the same rhythm.  I just felt really disconnected, and so I felt it was time to leave.  And I wanted to volunteer at WJZ and they said no they don't take volunteers.  And I wanted to intern and they said no they only take college students who are interns.  So one of my friends at Morgan was in charge of the internship so he signed me up as one of the students in his class so that I could go and do an internship at WJZ.  And I did it in the news department.  So I would be on air and go in the morning and then leave and be on the air in the afternoon.  The way the news department worked was that at about eight or nine o'clock people would come in to work on the noon and then the six o'clock news guys.  Actually it took all eight hours to develop the six o'clock news clas- newscast.  And most of the interns were there as well.  You know, the newsrooms, you've seen them on TV, one big open space, and busy and active and phones ringing and whatnot.  And there were three or four other interns and I was not getting a lot to do.  There was one black news producer.  She did the six o'clock in the morning newscast and she was a young person like me and she said, "You know, if you come and intern with me, I'll show you everything."  She got to the station at 10:30 the night before in order to do the six a.m. newscast.  So, I started coming in after the eleven o'clock newscast and working with her.  And she taught me how to write stories, how to listen to the scanners, how to work with the editor.  In about two weeks, a producer left, an associate producer moved up, a production assistant moved up and there was a production assistant's position.  And word had spread about this intern who was working overnight, nobody did that.  So I applied, they asked me to apply for this PA position and I got it.  So that took about a month (laughter).  It happened so fast I was--I was literally spellbound.
Speaker 1: When did you sleep?
Speaker 2: I got off the air and I'd go home and go to sleep, and then the gentle- gentleman who I knew at Morgan who was in the counseling department, he helped people find jobs.  He would drive me to the station.  Sometimes I'd go in at eleven, sometimes he'd wake me up at three or four and drive me there so I could be there for those few hours before it started.  He was very committed to helping me move on.  I know in the winter, he'd have a sleeping bag in the car so I could climb in and get warm, and, and go into the station.
Story_ID: 650429
Speaker 1: This is kind of--correct me if I'm wrong, but this is kind of like a golden age of black radio--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think so.
Speaker 1: --all over the cou-.  In D.C. [Washington, D.C.] you got Dewey Hughes and [HistoryMaker] Cathy Hughes.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And you got stations and these are FM--
Speaker 2: WPFW [WPFW Radio, Washington, D.C.] and DCS [ph.].
Speaker 1: Yeah, stations a quiet storm kind, all these things are going on.
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Dyana Williams at Howard [Howard University, Washington D.C.].
Speaker 2: Yep, Frankie Crocker in New York [New York].
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you got like the political, you know, like Kweisi Mfume, and you've got like programs into the HUR [WHUR Radio] at Howard, a lot of influence?
Speaker 2: Yep, a lot of community affairs program.  As a matter of fact, when I was still at Antioch [Antioch College; Antioch University] I did some time at WPFW in Washington, D.C., just expanding my knowledge of different kinds of music.  So with the political orientation around understanding myself in a global sense as an African ancestored person, having parents [Shirley Jones and Eustace Jones] who were from another country [Guyana] in the first place, it really--I was able to translate that into the type of work that I have done for most of my career.  So you know, when I left television and went over to Columbia Pictures and then moved out to California, I volunteered at KPFK [KPFK Radio, North Hollywood, California], which was the Pacifica [Pacifica Radio Network] station there; and then they asked me to join the board.
Story_ID: 650430
Speaker 1: Now, you were at WJZ-TV [Baltimore, Maryland]--
Speaker 2: For four years.
Speaker 1: --for four years; and by the time you left what were you doing?  Were you--
Speaker 2: I was a news producer for--I had been doing the six o'clock in the morning show and also news produced for the weekend newscasts.  And there was a magazine show, a current events magazine show on Sundays that I did a newscast for.  So that's what I was doing at the time news producer primarily.
Speaker 1: And you received an award, a social justice award for TV journalism? And--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes, and also Associated Press received an award there for some of my radio work [at WEAA Radio, Baltimore, Maryland] and for this same show.  It was a program on homelessness that I produced a short piece for the news.  The reporter, DonClark Williams lived on the street for a weekend and that doesn't sound like a lot, but he was nearly completely disoriented.  I mean part of what I had to do, I was friends with a woman who was a psychiatrist and you know, we were shooting things that he had done and places he had been, and then I took him to her so that he could talk through getting back to himself.  Because those overnights outside was a lot, it was too much.  Not, you know, not knowing where you're gonna sleep or eat, not bathing.  He, you know, it was a lot.
Story_ID: 650431
Speaker 1: Eighty-seven [1987] was a big year--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and I mean you lost your husband in '87 [1987] too?
Speaker 2: Yes I did.  He was--he was killed by someone he knew.  This is--he was a young man, we were both still very active in the Moorish movement [Moorish Science Temple of America], although the case that I mentioned before was moving onto the circuit court [Circuit Court for Baltimore County] and it really caused a division in our temple.  It broke it apart.  Yeah, there's nothing like a lawsuit and the threat of imprisonment to put the fear in people.  And so we were not--no longer an active organization, although he and I were still friends.  And it had an impact on a number of people.  That temple was--and I think the same thing happened with the Nation of Islam and their temples.  They were oases, they were respites, they were havens for people who were having tough lives, and most of us were having tough lives.  Either imprisonment or drug addiction or just poverty.  And so my--when we left the temple it was too much I think for a number of people, the fact that we knew who we were in an ancestral sense.  We knew who we were as human beings and what we lost in this country, what we lost both from slavery, but what we lost from not being recognized as who we were as people under this cloud of oppression.  And I just think in a number of ways it got too much for him.  So he was working in Washington [D.C.].  He had experienced some discrimination on his job and set out to start his own business.  "I'll just do, I'll just hustle."  He had a clothing cleaning business for a while.  And then he and I separated.  And then he was killed not long after by someone he knew.
Speaker 1: Okay. His name was?
Speaker 2: Who he thought was a friend but was not.
Speaker 1: Okay. His name was Musa Bey [ph.]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 650432
Speaker 1: And so it's just the next year that you--
Speaker 2: I left (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) go out to California, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was really nothing else for me to stay in Baltimore [Maryland] for.  And I was ready to grow.  I had this notion that there was more somewhere.
Speaker 1: So did you have the offer from Sony [Sony Pictures Entertainment]?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, the same gentleman that drove me to the TV station [WJZ-TV, Baltimore, Maryland] had a colleague who was in HR [human resources] at The Coca-Cola Company, which owned Columbia Pictures and they wanted to do this program to get, to train a new level of leadership.  So there were ten of us from a nationwide search that were selected.  There was another African American woman, a Latino man and the rest were white.  And we--I moved back to New York [New York] to work for Columbia Pictures.
Speaker 1: So you went to New York for--
Speaker 2: I went to New York for a year and then Sony [Sony Corporation] bought the company the following year and it was the beginning of my second year in this program and so I moved to California.
Speaker 1: So you were living in Culver City [California]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I was living in Venice [Los Angeles, California] actually.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the studio was at--that first year was at the Warner Brothers lot [Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.].  Columbia and Warner Brothers shared a lot.  And then with the new management was Peter Guber and Jon Peters bought the MGM lot [Metro Goldwyn Mayer Inc.; Metro Goldwyn Mayer Studios Inc.] in Culver City, and so we moved over there.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: And that's where I was for the next six years.
Story_ID: 650433
Speaker 1: What was your job, I guess, in terms of--
Speaker 2: In the movie business?
Speaker 1: Yeah, in the movie business, yeah.
Speaker 2: So, the program was two years.  Every six months we were assigned to the head of a different division.  So my first year I worked for exhibition, the company owned Loews Theaters [Loews Cineplex Entertainment Corporation] at the time and I was stationed with the CFO.  And then I went to international marketing, again from New York [New York].  This is when movies, at the time, movies were released here, and they were released later in different parts of the world.  And so the actors could go on junkets.  We would schedule those around the world and track the different names of the same movie.  Because, you know, sometimes things don't translate the same way in another language.  So we would go through all of that with them.  I left there and went to California and in my first semester there, first six months there, I was put with the head of what they call physical production.  These are the people that scout the locations and hire the below the line talent.  The director is hired, the line producers, the director of photography, the camera people, the costuming and lighting and all of that.  So I worked with them mapping out the various films and where they would be shot and locations around the world.  And then I left that and went to corporate affairs.
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll go back a little bit and ask you about some of the movies, 'cause I know--
Speaker 2: At the time?
Speaker 1: Yeah, uh-huh, that you worked on?
Speaker 2: I worked on 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' came out while I was there.  'Radio Flyer,' I worked on. What were some others? 'Glory' came out around that period of time.  I'm blanking (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, that's (unclear). Yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'A League of Their Own' I remember that coming out then.  'Hook' which was the Dustin Hoffman Peter Pan one.
Speaker 1: Right, was 'School Daze' one of the ones?
Speaker 2: Was 'School Daze' out there, we didn't, we weren't aligned with them.
Speaker 1: That came out in '88 [1988]. But I thought--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was out, that was around that time, but it wasn't a Columbia [Columbia Pictures] or a TriStar [TriStar Pictures] film.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay. Yeah (unclear).
Speaker 2: So I would not have been.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Denzel [Denzel Washington] had a production company on the lot at that time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, was John Singleton associated with--?
Speaker 2: Yes, 'Boyz n the Hood,' absolutely.  Yeah, I knew John, his, he--his company was in the building next to the Thalberg Building [Irving Thalberg Building].
Story_ID: 650434
Speaker 1: Also Sidney was there.  Now Sidney Poitier was--had a building named after him there.  But in the late '60s [1960s], Sidney was the money maker for Columbia Pictures.  He was the money maker for Columbia Pictures.  And I remember while I was there, the Directors Guild [Directors Guild of America] was honoring him one year.  You know, whenever they have these big dinners and whatnot, all the studios buy tables and so Columbia bought a table, bought a couple of tables so that they could be there to honor Sidney.  And at the time, the highest ranking black employee was the executive vice president for the music that wa- of the film business.  His name was Bob Holmes.  And we noticed that the heads of the studio had bought a couple of tables to honor Sidney and invited no people of color.  And so Bob initiated a letter that four or five of us signed.  So there was one EVP [executive vice president], one senior vice president, which is the next rank down, two or three vice presidents, and I was a director at the time, and also, [HistoryMaker] Debra Martin Chase.  She came into the same management program a year or two after I did, and then she worked for--after she completed the program, she ran Denzel's [Denzel Washington] production company for a couple of years.  So Bob wrote this letter that all of us signed saying, you know, we really--, "You're our role model and we so appreciate you and we're so happy that you got this award and we're here as Columbia employees to say that your mark has been indelible.  You know, I don't think we put, although we were not invited to come and--and celebrate you, we just wanted you to know that we were here and we care."  And I'm in my office one day and the phone rings and I pick it up, and someone says, "Are you--are you free to take a call from Mr. Poitier?"  I said, "Yes."  Sidney called everybody who signed that letter to thank us and to say it is framed in his office and when he's an old man in his rocking chair, he will remember this.  I mean because we--when he was there at the lot, it was Sidney and the man that shined shoes, were the only black people on the lot.  And he was their star money maker for four or five or six years running.  So he meant a lot to the film business, but he meant a lot to us too.  We wanted him to know that.
Speaker 2: That's important for us to know.
Story_ID: 650435
Speaker 1: Were there any other black people there that served as like mentors or as, as--that would help?
Speaker 2: Well, one of my mentors was a, a man named Harvey Lehman [Harvey J. Lehman, Jr.].  He had run HR [human resources] for a while, but now he was running corporate affairs.  When I first got there I had made it my mission to meet all the black executives, of which there were, as I said, four or five, so it wasn't like I had a big number to track down, and he was one.  I went into his office and he said, "Have a seat."  And he said, "I just wanna tell you I don't believe in programs."  I said, "I figure if you're good enough for a program, you're good enough to be hired and just do the job and take your chances like everybody else."  And that's when I learned that there had been a program before me and then one before that when David Puttnam ran Columbia [Columbia Pictures].  He was--he was from London [England], a director from London and he was brought in.  And you remember even in the late '60s [1960s], [HistoryMaker] Stan Lathan's period of time when he moved into television and then film.  You know there were programs that launched some of us and then would die out because we would stay only as long as the program existed.  And he was very suspicious of that.  The way this program, this management associates program was constructed was that we were hired for the two years.  There was no guarantee that we would get full time employment, it was just if there was a space and you worked out.  And what happened for me, being in corporate affairs where Harvey was, the woman who ran corporate affairs, she had been in business affairs and had moved over there.  She got pregnant and went on maternity leave, and they put me as a seat warmer.  And so by the time she came back from maternity leave I was in, I had a full time job.  But it took some thinking and maneuvering, not everyone who went through the program ended up staying or could.  So I really credit him, he was very community minded.  He taught me a lot about how to use the resources of the studio to help in the community and help with non-profits.  And that--that year while she was on maternity leave was the first year I and another colleague in corporate affairs started doing volunteer days with our employees doing things out- that wasn't something that companies did at that time.
Story_ID: 650436
Speaker 1: And the other thing I st- I started then was our symposium series.  One of the things I noticed was that I knew that studios like Columbia [Columbia Pictures] made popular culture that went around the world.  I lived in a country where I saw the advent of television.  I wen- in Guyana at that time, everything came late.  When I was a teenager, if a magazine came out in March it got to Guyana in May.  If a movie came out, I remember going to a movie once with three or four friends, we rode our bikes there, we got to the movie and the movie that was playing, as a first run movie, was 'Madame X' starring Lana Turner.  That movie came out in the '40s [sic.], and we were still going to see it then.  I remember because it was so sad at the end that we were sharing this one handkerchief, we were crying.  But things were late and slower then.  And I know that people in other parts of the world view America based on what they see in these programs and these films.  But when I looked at the people who were making the programs and films, they were some of the more underdeveloped people I had met.  Underdeveloped in that they hadn't been anywhere really or if they went on holiday, they went in their own bubble.  They stayed in the lovely hotel, they ate in the American restaurant.  They demanded everything to be the way they expected it to be a home.  So, it started with Black History Month.  I started doing, through the human relations calendar, some kind of event for the employees in the studio to get a taste of another culture.  It could be speakers or films or workshops, or cooking classes or you know, big dances, but that was the beginning of something that I think still happens there now, and that I started doing at Sony Music [Sony Music Entertainment] when I left.
Story_ID: 650437
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about the symposium se- series that we were just (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  So at Sony Pictures [Sony Pictures Entertainment] we did something, it was six times a year and it ended up being every month.  But they were, as I said, speakers in--from all walks of life, some artists, some directors.  I remember we did, while I was there, 'Devil in a Blue Dress' was a film, yep.  Denzel [Denzel Washington] and Carl Burnett [sic. Carl Franklin] was the director, and Walter Mosley.  So, we did a symposium with them and I actually had Walter come several times to speak about his books and about writing--
Speaker 1: Walter Mosley?
Speaker 2: Walter Mosley, yep.  And we did the preview of the film there.  We did topics on Hispanics and Asians.  And we had comedians and dancers, and we did some arts projects and workshop.  I wanted people to get a sense of not just the films, but of what life was like for folks and to try things.  So that went through--went through at Columbia Pictures and our partnership, Harvey Lehman [Harvey J. Lehman, Jr.] who ran corporate affairs had a partnership with the gentleman who ran corporate affairs for Columbia Records, remember we're a sister company, Sony Pictures and Sony Music [Sony Music Entertainment].  And how corporate affairs worked at times was that, if you were supporting a nonprofit organization or an NGO [non-governmental organization], many times you would partner with another company.  So say the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, their annual legis- legislative weekend, a company would want to do a sponsorship.  So we might say, "I'll do twenty-five thousand you do twenty-five thousand and we'll join together."  When I ran corporate affairs later at Sony Music, I had partners with a peer at Time Warner [Time Warner, Inc.], someone at CBS and someone at New Line [New Line Cinema].  And so we would go in, especially when sponsorship dollars were decreasing, we would go in together.  But back then, that was how I met H. LeBaron Taylor who ran corporate affairs for Sony Music.  And when I was ready to come back to the East Coast, a friend said, "Why don't you talk to LeBaron?" I hadn't even thought of it.  And I did and he saw some of the work that I'd been doing, yeah, in California and liked it.  When I first went to speak with him, I remember it was in April or May, and he said you know, "I just hired somebody, I wish I had known sooner."  But then in August he called and said, "She didn't work out, so if you're still interested," and I was, so I was able to move back to New York [New York] from California.
Speaker 1: So this is 1994?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. And Harvey Lehman's name, I didn't get it on, I didn't record it but it's spelled?
Speaker 2: His--Harvey, H-A-R-V-E-Y, Lehman, L-E-H-M-A-N.
Speaker 1: And yeah--
Speaker 2: And LeBaron?
Speaker 1: Yeah, H. LeBaron, right.
Speaker 2: Capital L, small E, capital B-A-R-O-N, Taylor, T-A-Y-L-O-R.
Story_ID: 650438
Speaker 1: Now he has quite a history from what I read?
Speaker 2: Quite a history.  My goodness.  So when I knew LeBaron [H. LeBaron Taylor], his history with Columbia Records was in marketing.  And Harvey--LeBaron had been on radio in Detroit [Michigan].  He had a deep resonate voice.  He is contemporaries with [HistoryMaker] Berry Gordy and Al Bell, and the Philly International [Philadelphia International Records] guys, Gamble and Huff [HistoryMaker Kenny Gamble and HistoryMaker Leon Huff].  And so he talked a lot about being in radio and then getting into the music business and developing black music marketing.  He took his cue from the beverage and car companies who were targeting the black community in terms of their marketing.  Up until then, people did general marketing because they figured everybody buys what white people buy, so we don't really have to cater to them.  But he brought to the music industry the notion of targeting the black market and created a whole group of distributors and salespeople and marketing people out of that department.  And so he did that for over a decade.  But in that work and because he was the type of person who was in so many different nonprofit organizations and knew so many people, he was really great friends with Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] and Johnnie Cochran, and he was in the Boule [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity] and he was often down on Capitol Hill [Washington, D.C.].  He was a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus along with the congresspeople, there were some corporate folks and was the founding member there.  And he would come back and say, "There's a bill coming through the commerce committee that has to do with postal, and bi- ," back then, Columbia had that Columbia mail order broadcasting where you could order records in the mail, he said, "I think it's gonna impact our mail order business."  And he'd come back with these different--and they said you know, "Do you really, do you wanna run corporate affairs for us because you're giving us all this information, you should do this."  So by the time I met him, he had been running corporate affairs and brought me over to--to do a number of things, continue doing the symposium series that I was doing in pictures, he wanted me to do it in New York [New York] at Sony Music [Sony Music Entertainment], and also to help with his community outreach which had a very political side to it.  So it was through him that I met Mr. Jackson and--
Speaker 1: Now when you say political, you don't mean?
Speaker 2: I don't mean in the Republican and Democratic sense.  I mean in the black caucus foundation [Congressional Black Caucus Foundation], the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], the Urban League [National Urban League] in that sense, La Raza [National Council of La Raza; UnidosUS].  And he--he was the liaison.  So corporate affairs in companies is PR [public relations] for the company, but for its community phase, not for its products.  Sometimes we would use the products.  For example, we would help a nonprofit organization by paying for one of our artists to perform at a gala.  I remember once having Luther perform for a nonprofit and we paid for him in the, you know, corporate affairs funding would pay for that so that the nonprofit--
Speaker 1: Luther Vandross, right (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, Luther Vandross.  I have to say the full name, thank you for reminding me.  Yes, Luther Vandross.  He was a Columbia artist.  Michael Jackson was a Columbia artist.  There were a number of fabulous, wonderful artists that were on the roster at the time.
Story_ID: 650439
Speaker 1: Now did you continue with the symposia?
Speaker 2: Yes I did.  I continued with that. I went to--
Speaker 1: 'Cause you were bringing in some important people to Columbia [Columbia Pictures] to speak (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was, yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, these are Deepak Chopra?
Speaker 2: Chopra, Deepak Chopra yes, that was at Sony Pictures [Sony Pictures Entertainment].
Speaker 1: You got Robert Thurman.
Speaker 2: We brought--Robert Thurman, yes at Columbia, Columbia University [New York, New York].  He's the Buddhist scholar, taught at Columbia, Uma Thurman's father.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Kunstler--
Speaker 2: William Kunstler, it was a few months before he died.  It was the O.J. trial [People of the State of California v. Orenthal James Simpson, 1995] had started, I think, or he was--it was about to end.  William Kunstler said then, you know, the trial went for almost a year.  He said, "If O.J. Simpson is convicted I will come back here and eat this carpet."  He was convinced early on that O.J. would never be convicted.
Speaker 1: These great civil rights attorneys--
Speaker 2: He represented the Panthers [Black Panther Party]--
Speaker 1: --he represented the Chicago Seven.
Speaker 2: --yes, Chicago Seven yes.  So he came to talk about his political work and he talked about O.J. Simpson in light of the very political nature of that whole.  It was a meeting of so many things in that trial.
Speaker 1: You got Farai Chideya.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, Farai is a radio broadcaster and a bloggest now and a writer.
Speaker 1: Now this is a great--
Speaker 2: Robert Kennedy came and spoke once, Robert Kennedy's son.
Speaker 1: Junior [Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.], yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes, that was powerful.  I remember when he came because he spoke from no notes and did this whole presentation on the birthright of the nation's parks [National Park Service].  He used biblical references, quranic references to the power of nature and the earth and our stewardship of it.  I thought it was a wonderful talk.
Speaker 1: It's just a--a fellow--Queens [New York] ne--
Speaker 2: I mentioned Charlie Rose that I had--
Speaker 1: Char- yeah.
Speaker 2: --he came to speak.  You know, he interviewed a lot of people.  I said, "Why don't you take a turn and be interviewed?"
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Danny Glover.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Ossie Davis.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Ruby Dee.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Bill T. Jones, the dancer. And--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I later joined Bill T.'s board during those years as well.
Story_ID: 650440
Speaker 1: What was the response at, at Sony [Sony Music Entertainment]?
Speaker 2: So we--people loved it.  I mean it--it showed the employees that the company cared about their development more than just, "Do your job."  It also helped them to see a different side of these things that we did as commerce.  You know, we pervade in popular culture.  We were an international company and it helped people to see what people in other parts of the world were probably thinking about the products that we were selling them.
Speaker 1: 'Cause you mentioned earlier the concern that there was people making movies who were living a narrow life?
Speaker 2: Yes, I'll give you an example.  It was something that I read in Essence when the movie 'Ghost' came out.  And this sister was transferring to a job in Japan.  And she had seen 'Ghost' and liked it and loved it, and laughed along with everybody else.  It happened to be the inflight movie on her plane.  Watching 'Ghost' on a plane full of Japanese people was a whole different way of looking at it.  She began to look at it the way they were seeing it.  And there were parts of it that seemed like a caricature of black people.  And I've had similar experiences where people assume what they see in movies or what they hear in music or what they read in magazines is the way everybody lives.  So you know, they--many people around the world think that all we are about is being killed by the police or each other, or doing drugs or singing and dancing, and playing sports.  And they don't see--and then as a converse, I remember reading when Will Smith went to Africa, who was it--was it either he or Sean "Puffy" Combs [Sean Combs], first trip to Africa, being surprised that there were skyscrapers and buildings and cars and homes, and being surprised because most people's orientation is of the Africa where there's either revolts happening or tribal things happening, or wild animals or disease and famine.
Speaker 1: Now he attended Howard [Howard University, Washington D.C.], you know, you would just think that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but he was a young man that had been under exposed.  Exposure is so key.  So I figured it would be better if we brought it right to the building.  We usually did them at lunchtime.  We would have it catered.  We would have the dining room, I wanted silverware and dishes and glasses so the people would--and cloth napkins, so they would know that this was special.  You know, not go out and spend twenty minutes finding a sandwich or bringing it in.  We would feed people; and we could spend the whole hour or a little bit more then and have folks have a real immersion in something.
Story_ID: 650441
Speaker 1: Did you see yourself as building a culture there [Sony Music Entertainment]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I--I wanted to.  My fantasy was that they would give me a space that could be like a studio so that I could then start working with some of the artists and some of the music to create pieces that we could have performed different places or that we could put on the air, we could make small versions of to broadcast.  Never got to that point, but I did enjoy.  One of the last things I did was--we had found the Columbia [Columbia Records] music archives photo- photographs in some files down in the basement.  And they wanted to begin using them as reproductions to sell.  So they asked me, "What could we do with this to--," to get them out there.  And I picked about fifty of the portraits and had them blown up and framed, and we did a museum exhibit in the building, the Sony building on 5th Avenue [New York, New York].  And there were moments when I walked in the room where we had those photographs of a young Miles Davis and you know, Billie Holiday, and Charlie Parker and Tony Bennett who's gonna be eighty something years old now at twenty, and Carole King at seventeen, and just these young people developing this music.  It felt like a cathedral in that room.  And then--for a week or two, almost, we had some of those performers or their managers come and talk about putting that music together.  That was actually when I first spent time with Gamble and Huff [HistoryMaker Kenny Gamble and HistoryMaker Leon Huff] because we had a picture of them as young men.  I knew that--and the Philly International label [Philadelphia International Records] was half owned by or the library catalog was half owned.  And so we did a game, we had them come in and then we played--I started--name that tune.  I played the first ten seconds of a song and see if people could identify it.  Because folks didn't know, not just the music that they did themselves, but music they wrote that other people performed.  There's so much richness and then when you start talking about the era and the times, and how the music business was at the time; it was all kind of interrelated.
Story_ID: 650442
Speaker 1: That was around the period of time, well LeBaron [H. LeBaron Taylor] died a few years into my stint there, and I took over running the department [at Sony Music Entertainment] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah (unclear)--that's 2000 I think it was?
Speaker 1: Yes.  I took over running the department and joined the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation board and the Rhythm and Blues Foundation, and so some of that same work he was doing, we were able to continue doing.
Speaker 2: Right, so these are--these are all significant partnerships.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: You know, Center for Arts Education [New York, New York], Center for Traditional Music and Dance [New York, New York].  Quite a few, the Clive Davis Institute [Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music, New York, New York], Harlem School of the Arts [New York, New York], New York public schools [New York City Department of Education].
Speaker 1: What I wanted to do was have the Columbia [Columbia Records] as a company and the music business as a whole begin to help with the education of students.  It wasn't the beginning of it, but I was able to bring it into some areas that it may not have been in before.  So, that we could actually support teachers and the learning of music throughout our contributions and sometimes through our artists.  And then some of our artists had nonprofit organizations that we could work with.  Midori [ph.] had one and she was doing some work in the Chinatown [New York, New York] area and we were able to help further that and through Harlem School of the Arts as we said before.
Speaker 2: Do you have a favorite partnership that you?
Speaker 1: My favorite partnership, I think this is the--a culmination of all of these things was when I joined the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation board.  One of the things I asked the then board chair was, "What is it that you would like, what's on your wish list of things that you want during your tenure as chair of this board, and how could we help?"  So I asked him for his top four or five things, and three of them were ones that I felt that we, as a studio, could do.  One was he wanted to see the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's website translated into other languages.  So we were able to help fund that.  The big one was, he said he wanted to see better relationships between the minority caucuses on the Hill [Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.], the Congressional Black foundation [Congressional Black Caucus], the Congressional Hispanic foundation [Congressional Hispanic Caucus], and the Asian Pacific Islander Caucus [Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus].  And so having done symposium work, having--knowing the value of the arts and helping people to understand social issues, political issues, human rights issues, human development, and also my own spiritual work, my own metaphysical work, throughout--throughout the years I made it a practice every year to do some kind of work in personal development, human potential, conscious raising work.  So over the years I did transcendental meditation.  I did est [Erhard Seminars Training], I did Landmark [Landmark Forum], I did Loving Relationships Training, I did sound therapy.  All of those things that, and then I would weave--find ways to weave the two together: culture and human development.
Story_ID: 650443
Speaker 1: So when he asked to do that, the idea I came up with was to do a retreat for those three minority groups [Congressional Tri-Caucus].  And so that we would fund.  The first one was held outside of Washington [D.C.] in Virginia at a hotel.  It was over a weekend.  We--I hired someone to do--to facilitate some of their work together, and also had entertainment.  So I went to [HistoryMaker] Russell Simmons.  At the time they had the 'Def Poetry Jam' and we created a 'Def Poetry Jam' evening during their retreat and had some of the poets that later were on 'Def Poetry' on Broadway to come and perform.  A multicultural group of poets.  We had Sarah Jones come who is the actress who does, she won a Tony [Antoinette Perry Award for Excellence in Theatre] for her one woman performance where she represents a number of different cultures.  Her first piece was called 'Surface Transit.'  She has this uncanny ability to replicate any accent under the sun and she tells the story of different immigrants coming to New York [New York] in America, and their--their influence with each other.  So she performed.  She had a piece called 'This Revolution will not be Televised' [sic. 'Your Revolution'].  It was kind of based on the one that Gil Scott-Heron song ['The Revolution Will Not Be Televised'] that he did that had been banned from the air, and so she was able to perform it in front of members of [U.S.] Congress who was going, "Why was this banned?" And we're able to work with helping her reverse that.  The other moment in that retreat that stands out for me was the facilitator had had them--we had a timeline on there and she asked them to go up and to indicate when they got involved in public service.  And one of them on the Hispanic caucus [Congressional Hispanic Caucus], one of the congressmen, talked about his political career started as a border guard.  He was a border police.  And in Sarah's monologue, she replicated a young man whose family had been arrested by the border police and used a term that they use to describe the border police [La Migra], a Spanish language term.  So later when the congressman is talking about it, he talked about how he had heard this term and it was derogatory in a sense, and moved him to tears.  You know, he got emotional about it and in that came this whole conversation of everyone talking about what brought them into public service.  So we had those who were the children of migrant workers with the grandchildren of sharecroppers with the--the descendants of immigrants with the same universal approach to public service and now in the Congress and that was started because they were in the same room together talking about it and because they heard a theater piece that urged them to--that was the catapult to that.  That was the culmination to me of everything that I think is important in the work that I do.
Speaker 2: Okay, and this retreat was in what year?
Speaker 1: Oh you're asking me years, I remember when I was thinking about--
Speaker 2: About 2001, 2000--
Speaker 1: --preparing this.  It was after LeBaron [H. LeBaron Taylor] died, so it might've been around 2002 or three [2003].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So we did three actually with them.  That first one and then a year later or so we did one that was in Puerto Rico, and then the third one was in Texas right around the time of Hurricane Rita.  So it was not as--we had to switch the focus of it more into a town hall in Houston [Texas] because of the devastation and the need.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay. Now you were the founder of Sony's [Sony Music Entertainment] diversity--?
Speaker 1: Yes, they did not have affinity groups then, and so I helped form a black, Hispanic and Asian affinity groups; and then that was the year I was one of the founding members of the diversity council for the company [Sony Music Diversity Council].
Story_ID: 650444
Speaker 1: Now in the '90s [1990s], and we skipped over this, I'm sorry because of, I guess, the way the out- outline is written, but you adopted a little girl [Makara Bey], right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I did, I did.  I--I--I--after my husband [Musa Bey (ph.)] died and I left I wasn't sure if I would remarry and I was already in my late thirties.  I wasn't sure I was going to have children, and so I kind of resigned myself to not.  But my college friend, the one through whom I met Nell [Nell Merlino].  She was one of the four of us that left Antioch [Antioch College; Antioch University] and came back to New York [New York].  I was godmother to one of her daughters and she was an African dancer who went in summers to teach African dance at a holistic health resort in Hawaii.  And there met an American woman who lived in Hawaii and did Asian adoptions.  She traveled to Thailand and later to Cambodia doing Asian adoptions, and had and ran an orphanage there with some Cambodians.  And so my friend, her name is Isato [ph.], got a call from Lauren [ph.] who ran the adoption saying, "I have a child here, she was just brought in.  She's half Ghanaian and half Cambodian."  It's mostly white people who adopt from Asia, but she didn't want to place her.  She wanted to place her with an African ancestored family.  And so she called Isato and said, "Do you know anybody?"  And Isato thought of me.  And I remember I have the piece of paper where her husband had written the message was he tore an--envelope and had her name on it, Ghanaian and Cambodian three years old.  It said, "Lauren called, tell Isisara [HistoryMaker Isisara Bey]."  So I remember when she called and I said, "Do you really think so--." I had written that off.  And she said, "No, I think you can do it."  And I knew I always wanted to have a family.  I didn't see myself as not having kids.  And so I called the adoption agency.  They had a U.S. branch in Seattle [Washington] and the adoption agent's sister ran the one in Seattle.  And she told me about this little girl who's half Ghanaian and half Cambodian and she was three, and she lived in their orphanage and they wanted to have her adopted.  And we spoke.  And a lot of Guyanese feel like they come from Ghana, that is kind of the place where most of them traveled from Africa to South America, most were Ghanaians.
Speaker 1: The natural question here I guess would occur to most folks is that how did a Ghanaian from West Africa, you know, get with someone in Cambodia.  I--well, you know, people can travel around the world, but is--
Speaker 2: Yes, how did that happen?
Speaker 1: --a specific story about this?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was a UN [United Nations] soldier--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and there was a contingent of Ghanaian UN soldiers that were in Cambodia to help with free elections.  And so--and so he was there and met my daughter's mother.  But he left after his--when his regiment left.  And so my daughter was being raised by her mother and grandmother.  When she was a toddler, about one or tw- one or two years old, her mother married a Cambodian man and she became pregnant with his kids and he then decided he did not want a little black girl.
Speaker 1: Now, Africans and African Americans even are stigmatized in Asia from what I understand from the Vietnam War stories (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.  And well what I noticed was that the Cambodians didn't even like the Vietnamese much, and they were right next door.
Story_ID: 650445
Speaker 1: So did you make a trip to Cambodia, to--?
Speaker 2: Yes, when I decided to adopt and they accepted me as--as her adoptive parent.  I was waiting for my American papers or immigration papers to come through.  At the time, there was one person who handled international adoptions for New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey.  So there was a backlog.  But I happened to have to go to Japan for some meetings with--at Sony [Sony Corporation] in Japan.  Several of us from Pictures [Sony Pictures Entertainment] and Music [Sony Music Entertainment] and international were there.  While I was there, Lauren [ph.] the adoption agent called me and said, "You're more than halfway here now and she can't wait anymore."  My daughter would see kids coming and getting adopted and leaving, and just become more and more distraught.  And she was old enough that she knew that another mother was coming for her.  I'd made a necklace with my picture on it and I had a necklace of her picture, and I sent a picture of me wearing hers and I sent her a necklace with my picture.  And every time a new parent would come she'd look at the picture and look at them and get upset.  And so I had nothing, I had no--none of the papers, I didn't have the money, I didn't have any clothes, all this was back home waiting for permission.  And she said, "Just come, we'll make it work," and I did.  I was there for a couple of weeks and we--and de- Lauren worked with immigration to get the papers for me, but it took longer.  They like to turn it around in a couple of days, but I was there for a couple of weeks waiting for this to come through.  So I got a chance to spend time in Cambodia with my daughter. Her name is Makara [Makara Bey].
Speaker 1: The country is recovering from the nightmare of Pol Pot and (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, they had recovered somewhat to the point where it was something that was no longer discussed.  And remember after Pol Pot was chased out, he was not yet dead.  He was out in the bush still kind of waging guerrilla war.  But many of the people who were in his government were still in the government.  And so people were living near folks who had turned them in.  Nobody moved.  There was one period of time Pol Pot had everybody leave the capital [Phnom Penh, Cambodia], everybody leave the capital.  The city was deserted for several days.  He wanted them to move out and work on these farms, which is crazy.  Can you imagine everybody having to move out--it was like a ghost town, there's a film about it ['The Killing Fields'] and came back.  So people came back and lots of folks were killed and, or disappeared.  And so you're living next to a neighbor, you don't know who it was that turned in your brother or your husband or whoever, but they are now your neighbor still.  And they stopped teaching about it.  He reset the clock.  He, not only changed the name of the cou- country to Kampuchea, he had all calendars starting with his regime.  He had the money changed.  He--and so people were coming back to--he killed a lot of intellectuals, a lot of scholars and teachers, and people were forbidden to speak any other language but Khmer.  So, my daughter's father was with UN [United Nations] soldiers who were there overseeing the first free elections.  And that's how she was made.  So when I went to get her, she was three.  Her mother and grandmother placed her in an orphanage, she was no longer wanted by her stepfather, and brought her here.  Well we got a chance to visit some of the country, went up to Angkor Wat [Cambodia] and visited one of the killing fields.  I had seen the movie and it wa- there're more than one.  There was one that was talked about there, but they're all over the country.  And at that time, the killing field was about a twenty or thirty minute ride outside of the capital, the one near there.  And it was just an area of land where thousands of bodies had been buried and you could still see bones sticking out of the ground.  And a piece--pieces of clothing.  It was u- they had paths you'd walk through areas and skulls, and it was something, something.  But they were no longer teaching it in schools.  They were not talking about it at all.  So I know that, number one, things can change on a dime in terms of governments and in terms of the way things are in a society and the people can forget very easily, they can make themselves forget until they now have a generation of young people who know very little facts about something that happened twenty-five or thirty years ago.
Story_ID: 650446
Speaker 1: Now how, how did having a new daughter [Makara Bey] change your life?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Oh wow.  I spent six months in utter terror.  I was so afraid.  It hit me when I was in the Tokyo airport on my way there.  I just started shaking and crying because I knew that I was now going to take on a responsibility for someone for the rest of my life.  And not only was it just another person, she was old enough to be able to decide whether she liked me or not.  You know, whether she wanted to be part of my family, although she couldn't make that decision.  I mean adults around her made the decision.  And so when I first got there, we drove from the airport, they put me in the car and we drove--it was a three hour drive to the orphanage where she was.  And there was a period of time when we stopped along the road and it's just a road and it's--we're in the rural areas now.  And we stopped and they said, "This is a shrine for travelers and we're gonna stop here and light some incense."  Our driver was a Cambodian.  He had also been in the army and was now helping the adoption agent.  So we lit that.  He said, "Okay so for now for the next hour we're not stopping."  And I said, "Okay."  He said, "Well sometimes there are roadblocks but they really are guerilla roadblocks and so if there is one, we're not gonna stop 'cause they're really there to rob."  It had happened a couple of weeks before there was a roadblock and they went thr- ran through it and they were shot at and so Lauren [ph.], the adoption agent and the child that was with her had to duck and the driver went through and she says he had said to her a few minutes later, "Do you have--do you have a scarf or a rag?" And she said, "Why?"  He says, "Well I got shot in the leg."  And so, but he kept going.  So I was there about a month or so after, so I--I got it.  But we were--that--that was one of the orphanages by the sea and it was lovely.  They had a deer, a doe and some animals, and she was asleep in a hammock when I got there.  They woke her up and brought her to me, and so she's sleepy and--and a little afraid and suspicious, and the first day she was wary.  That night she cried a lot.  She was in the room with me and Lauren was there and her sister had come from Seattle [Washington], we were all there together and she cried.  She stood against the wall and she cried and you know, she kept crying.  And we sang and we lit incense and we all laid down on the bed and she cried and came closer, and closer and closer 'til she was worn out and finally laid down next to me.  And then the next morning, I couldn't leave her for a minute.  If I left the room, she'd follow me.  So, she's twenty-two years old now and she's lovely.
Story_ID: 650447
Speaker 1: Did you have to adjust your activities when you got back home, what--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was a single parent.  LeBaron [H. LeBaron Taylor] was still alive then when--when she [Bey's daughter, Makara Bey] first came and he was very helpful, you know, with me in making the transition, being able to leave work [at Sony Music Entertainment], you know, early so I could get her from daycare and home, and even in the amount of time that I was able to stay.  At the time, I couldn't take maternity leave because maternity leave was only for people that had biological children.  So adoption meant I had to use vacation time.  So because he was the head of our department and division, he said, you know, "This is just between you and me, so call in once a day, just kind of keep abreast of what's happening and you can stay home."  So he gave me a couple of months in order to make the adjustment.  And it was a lot, but it got easier as time went on.  I thought a lot about the way that I was mothered and the kind of mother my mother [Shirley Jones] was, and that was my role model.  And she was really anxious to be an American.  I remember when she first came, she wasn't speaking English and so I found a Cambodian family, a couple, he had been giving me some lessons.  And I invited he and his wife to come to talk to her and explain some things to her.  But she wouldn't speak with them.  I think she thought she was gonna be taken away again.  So, they left and it was she and I and she--we made it work.  She learned English quickly.  She was there a few weeks and I remember we were in, I converted my bedroom into her room and put my bed in the living room and put a divider.  So we were on the floor and I was putting her socks on, and she patted me and she said, "Mommy." And I said, "Yes?"  And she said, "I'm happy."  Every time I think about that it moves me.  She, you know, three, and she knew when she said that.  Anyway, yeah, it's good.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Parenthood is good.
Story_ID: 650448
Speaker 1: I didn't ask you this, but, but you're doing a lot of good things at Sony [Sony Music Entertainment] it seems; and did you have any opposition from anyone at Sony about the diversity council [Sony Music Diversity Council] or any of the other?
Speaker 2: I don't think that there was opposition, not that.  But what there was is--was something that I think still exists in some of Corporate America.  There was a certain percentage of lip service.  Different from being opposed.  It's that we will do these things, but we won't go much farther.  So as an example, a colleague in HR [human resources] had made a proposal to do a mentor program in the company.  Midlevel people being mentored by senior execs, it was a diversity mentor program.  So I was a participant in the first year.  So I was being mentored by a senior vice president.  And it was also where we worked out the contours of this program, the dimensions of the program.  What we knew from being ser- from surveying everyone is that--in the company, is that people wanted to be able to move up or over within the company, they wanted to be able to be promoted.  And that was something that the higher ups said could not happen in the mentor program.  We wanted, for example through the diversity council, that senior execs or department heads' bonuses be tied to their hiring and promoting of diversity candidates.  And they said that, "No, we will not be doing that."  So any of the things that would actually make some of the diversity initiatives real were not permitted.  We could do workshops.  We could do diversity training.  We could do this mentor program.  But we could not do the things that would move the needle in terms of numbers.  We also talked a lot about if it's true in the world that women make less than men and diverse women might make less than folks in the majority population, what are the numbers in this company.  Well there's a way to find out, look at people's salaries.  Not permitted to do it.  So, I won't say that folks were opposed, but I will say that we did part of it, the part that could be the public gesture, that there is a diversity council, that there's diversity training, that there's a mentor program, but not the part that would actually change the numbers, change the reality in the ways that I thought were important, and others did as well.
Speaker 1: Do you think this is typical in Corporate America?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.  Especially after 2008 and '09 [2009] when the economy took a big turn as well.  Even before then, what hit the music industry was Napster [Napster Inc.] and the advent of the Internet.  So we saw the writing on the wall in the music industry early on.  I remember when we first started talking about how this would impact the music industry and my colleagues, my old friends at Sony Pictures [Sony Pictures Entertainment], were like, "Oh you poor things, look what's happening to you with the Internet--," and you know, like it couldn't happen to them.  Like, you know, and a year later they were in the same boat.  So the entertainment industry was slow in its response and the first response they had was to punish.  You know, we will sue the people who download or we'll sue the people who copy.  And then they got on board, well maybe we'll make our own replica of Napster.  But the industry changed so quickly and other companies who were in the technology sphere were making the advances, that there was an indelible change in the industry.  When I left Sony Music, the corporate affairs department was closed.  You know, it wasn't just me, it just stopped all together.  There's maybe someone who's doing that work now, but at that time, there was so much closing down of and restricting and losing people because of the economy, because the industry was not making the money that it used to.
Story_ID: 650449
Speaker 1: Now you left [Sony Music Entertainment] in, what year was that?
Speaker 2: Two thousand and seven [2007].
Speaker 1: Two thousand and seven [2007].
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: That's just before the big crash (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, just be- the big crash, yes.  But as I said, the entertainment industry was feeling it much sooner because of the new technology.
Speaker 1: Okay. Well, one of the things you did before you left was organize the first joint Congressional Tri-Caucus--?
Speaker 2: Yes, those were the retreats that I--
Speaker 1: Those were the retreats you were describing for?
Speaker 2: Yes.  So the retreats were what created the Tri-Caucus, which is an entity that still exists and it's registered in [U.S.] Congress as one of the caucuses.  And they, I think, have a joint budget.  They--they've introduced bills together that was based on, what the--the chair of the caucus foundation at the time wanted to do.  So that is something that I'm very proud of the fact it still exists and it--and they're still doing work.  And I think more and more important work as the political climate changes in this country around immigration for example.
Speaker 1: Now you retired at age fifty-four?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That seems like young?
Speaker 2: It was young.  But I had no more work.  So it was kind of like a--my dream would've been to spend out my years to retire ten years later or after that, but it was not meant to be.
Story_ID: 650450
Speaker 1: Two thousand seven [2007], you started with--as vice president of programs for the Count Me In for Women's Economic Independence? Is that right?
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Count Me In was started by Nell Merlino, my friend from college [Antioch College; Antioch University], who had done Take Our Daughters to Work Day [Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day].  She had worked with NetAid.  She had all in the sphere of women's advancement and started--Count Me In started as a fund for people to contribute money or raise money to help women with microbusinesses, small businesses.  American Express [American Express Company] became a major sponsor and a couple of years after starting and working with women with microbusinesses, they decided to do a business competition, a business pitch competition called Make Mine a Million Dollar Business.  And that was around the time when I joined.  You know I had, through my work in corporate affairs [at Sony Music Entertainment], supported a number of Nell's initiatives in this same space through Take Our Daughters to Work Day and NetAid and et cetera.  So when I left, she came to my retirement party and asked me to come and work with her in helping to develop more corporate support for this initiative.  And I said I would.  I think I would be effective for about a year, because the key to effective corporate affairs is the people that you know inside companies.  And so I had peers in some other companies, but within the year that I left, all of my peers were gone out of their jobs as well.
Speaker 1: So all the corporations were getting rid of (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, all the ones that I knew that I did things with were experiencing a changeover.  They were ether dissolving the department or--in order to save money, firing the higher priced execs and starting in with people at a lower level.  Or the other thing that was happening is in some companies they went from having an African American running corporate affairs to having a Latino run corporate affairs, a shift in the diverse population that they would focus on.
Speaker 1: Or based on what perceived political power or--
Speaker 2: I think so.  You know, around then was when we knew that the Hispanic population and Latino population was growing.  The African American population wasn't growing.  And so there were changes in society that needed to be addressed.  So again, it says to me a kind of limited thinking in the terms of corporations.  I can either do this group or this group or this group, and I can only do this much.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you stayed with Count Me In for about a year?
Speaker 2: Yes--no, longer than that, for several years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The Make Mine a Million Dollar Business I became vice president of programs.  I left the development area and began running these business pitch competitions in other parts of the country.  So they would be one or two day events with speakers and workshops and a business pitch competition.  We would have folks apply from around the country and they'd wanna come to a particular city.  We'd have fifty or sixty people who were semifinalists, and then they would do three minute pitches before a panel of judges.  So my job was to create these one or two day events in different cities, locating--finding the spots, getting the speakers, putting together the panels, running the business pitch competitions.  We also created a boot camp for some of the winners of the Make Mine a Million Dollar Business competition after they'd been there for a year or two so they could get advanced training and working with other companies to host them or help us put them on.  And I did that for several years.  So I felt again it was a similar kind of thing, the live events using personal development and the arts, doing workshops and things like that to help people get in touch with who they are and what they're doing.  There were people who brought the tactical sides of business, how to market, spreadsheets, hiring and firing, I would bring them together along with folks that would speak with them about what is your relationship to money in abundance and building their self-confidence, and being able to speak in the business pitch, being able to attract people and enroll them in you're thinking.  So they would be wonderful events, full day, helping people to embrace this in a number of different ways.  Small groups, big groups.  We'd do musical interludes, we'd have performances; those kinds of things.

Speaker 1: I know in 2012, well I don't know if this is the only one, but you, the TED [Technology, Entertainment and Design] talk--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --speech at Barnard College [New York, New York] is on YouTube, it's really eloquent.  You know, you know, I really enjoyed it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Thank you, thank you.  We had hosted one of our business pitch competition events [Make Mine a Million Dollar Business] at Barnard College.  They have an Athena Center for women [Athena Center for Leadership Studies] at Barnard College.  And the woman who runs the Athena Center heard me, I was--I spoke for the day, you know, I was the emcee for the day.  And when they did their first TEDx talks, they invited me to be one of the speakers the following year.  So that's how that TED talk came about.
Story_ID: 650452
Speaker 1: Twenty thirteen [2013], you started your own business, correct?
Speaker 2: I did.  Being around all those entrepreneurs, I started a business called Journey Agent Productions, which allows me to--allowed me to do the work that I do, keynote speaking, doing workshops with groups, departments of companies or individuals and doing one on one coaching.  And that was the auspice under which I did it and that I still do a lot of the work that I do.  So now for example, my major client is the March on Washington Film Festival where I'm executive producer of this annual film festival and a number of our little--other projects throughout the year, smaller projects throughout the year.  I also do keynote speaking for different organizations that invite me or conferences.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I also do workshops with folks.
Speaker 1: And you've worked with groups like--I mean corporate is like Tupperware [Tupperware Brands Corporation], the 42nd Street Theater [New 42nd Street, New York, New York]--
Speaker 2: Yes, I've done international work with Vital Voices [Vital Voices Global Partnership] and the Middle Eastern women's business network [Middle East and North Africa Businesswomen's Network].  I've been around the country, I've worked with the Apollo Women of the World Festival in England and Australia.  Speaking, doing workshops, helping the Apollo [Apollo Theater Foundation, New York, New York] organize their panels and speakers for the Women of the World Festival here in New York [New York] last year.  The thing I like about having my own company or having Journey Agent Productions is that I can interpret the work that I do in a number of different ways.  Whether it's a conference or a performance, or working with--for example, New Jersey Performing Arts Center [Newark, New Jersey], their marketing department doing a day long or a two day retreat with them.  It's how I choose to take everything that I have and all that I do and share it with other people that I, I enjoy very much, and I can still bring the human development piece, the entertainment piece and the political consciousness raising piece in it.
Speaker 1: What would you say a journey agent is--your, your (unclear)--yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah. (Pause) I think we're all on a journey from birth to death.  We're moving through many different phases of life.  We're also on a journey between who we imagine ourselves to be and who we are.  We're on a journey between who we are and who we want to be.  As a journey agent, I have a variety of tools and technologies that I use to help people and individuals make that passage from where they are to where they'd like to be.  Or from who they are to who they want to or born to be, and so that is a journey agent.  It is not--I take the journey with them.  I'm still doing it as well in all of these different ways from who I am to who I will be, from who I want to be to who I can become.  And also from one phase of life to another.  It used to be that, and maybe some people do, that when they retire they stop and they can travel and have a wonderful time.  I will always work, I'll work for a long time, partially because I formally retired [from Sony Music Entertainment] ten years before I needed to, so I need to work and I had a fairly young child [Bey's daughter, Makara Bey] to support.  But also because I noticed that when you stop you wither and it's so important to stay involved, to stay active.  And because I think that we're here to grow until we stop breathing.

Speaker 1: I just wanna ask you a little bit more about the March on Washington Film Festival.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What are some of the films that have been shown for this festival?
Speaker 2: Well, we do (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Wha- what's your scope and how, how long does the festival last and--?
Speaker 2: Yes, so the festival lasts, I've been involved with it for two years as producer.  I--it's four years old.  I became involved after the second year, when the founder of the festival, his name is Robert Raben, he has a public affairs and lobbying firm in Washington, D.C., asked me to join.  Now Robert was hired by Sony Music [Sony Music Entertainment] to be part of our D.C. communications team to help with our communications strategy when I was there.  He and I are the ones that developed the Tri-Caucus [Congressional Tri-Caucus] and the Tri-Caucus retreats.  So when I left and he continued with his company, he started the film festival at the fiftieth anniversary of the March on Washington, which was just yesterday, the anniversary.  I wanted to do something that would commemorate it.  And he and his team decided they'd do a little mini film festival.  The second year it went well, they got the backers, folks liked the idea.  They did it in three cities, in D.C., in Atlanta [Georgia] and in New York [New York], and it was for two or three days in each city.  That was when he asked me to join.  He remember the work we had done putting together the Tri-Caucus and the retreats, and felt that I could bring both the same consciousness and the same producing skills to that.  So the first year I curated a couple of panels and moderated them to see if it was--we wanted to work together and if I liked it, and I did.  So this past year, we did a ten day festival, seventeen different events in July in Washington, D.C.  We decided, he decided wanted it to be a destination event in Washington.  So we're not taking it to different cities it's very expensive and a lot of work.  But we are doing it in D.C.  And we've done a couple of films that are new, making the circuit.  For example, we aired the first and new [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou documentary, 'And Still I Rise' ['Maya Angelou: And Still I Rise'].  We did a film called 'Two Trains Runnin'' about this search for some old blues musicians, they were prominent in the '40s [1940s] and they disappeared in Mississippi.  And two different groups of people, one from California, one from New York, were in Mississippi the same time as Freedom Summer and the disappearance of the three civil rights workers [James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner].  So that film is powerful because it not only chronicles the music and the search for these blues singers who have disappeared, but they happen to be there at the same time as Freedom Summer.
Speaker 1: Right, which is one of the pivotal actions of the--yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Pivotal moments of the Civil Rights Movement, absolutely.  And they were in the same county as a matter of fact as when those--as where the three civil rights workers disappeared [Neshoba County, Mississippi].  Unbeknownst to them, they were driving around and had no idea all of this was happening, these three men.
Story_ID: 650454
Speaker 1: And let's see who else--what else did we do?  We, we sometimes do films that are older because, let's face it, for example we might show a piece of, 'Eyes on the Prize' [at the March on Washington Film Festival].  I've used that a lot in the last two years in workshop work because not many people have seen it, particularly people under forty.  So for example, the ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union] we partnered with them this past June, they do a summer student institute where they bring high school students to Washington, D.C. to learn about social justice and activism.  They asked us to do a workshop for them.  So I did a workshop where we showed the 'Eyes on the Prize' piece that depicts Freedom Summer, which were college students from all--all across the country coming to the South.  We had invited Rutha Harris who was a college student in Albany, Georgia in the '60s [1960s] and one of the original Freedom Singers, was Cordell Reagon, [HistoryMakers] Bernice Johnson Reagon, Rutha Harris, and Charles Neblett.  The folk singer Pete Seeger, who was active in the Civil Rights Movement, encouraged them, he and his wife [Toshi Seeger] to make a group and they used the music that they created out of the Civil Rights Movement.  For example, they were at a rally and one of the ministers said in his sermon, "We not gonna let nobody turn us around."  And they created a song ['Ain't Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me Around'] out of that, which is one of the anthems of the Civil Rights Movement.  And they would travel around the South singing this music, appearing at church rallies, doing workshops on voter rights and civil rights.  As young people, they would just call in and say, "Where do you want us to go next?" Jump in a car and go.  At a time when it was so dangerous to do that.  Rutha is seventy-five years old now.  Her voice is like a clarion bell, and so she sang and then I invited a young man named Jacob Bueno de Mesquita.  His father runs the institute for nonviolence and peace [Center for Nonviolence and Peace Studies] at the University of Rhode Island [Kingston, Rhode Island].  One of the founders of that institute is Bernard Lafayette, who was also active in this--in the Al- the Albany Movement and a protegee of Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  So Jacob is a grad student at the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland], but he's also a certified trainer in the tenets of nonviolence, which are six different principles and steps, it's more than just sit someplace and let people throw stuff on you or turn the other cheek.  It is nonviolence, King said nonviolence is something that will change your life, move your soul that requires commitment and integrity, and knowledge and a way to differentiate between making an enemy and making a colleague.  Between standing up for truth in a way that increases the peace instead of increases the conflict.  And so between the three of us, I brought human development practices, processes they're called, which are a lot like theater improvisational processes.  So my work in theater back in graduate school [Antioch College; Antioch University], some of the things that I did with those prisoners in the Baltimore City Jail [Baltimore, Maryland], I could do with these students, because it involves interaction, it involves looking at yourself in a way that you had not seen yourself before; and having an experience that is transformational.
Story_ID: 650455
Speaker 1: Now tell us about the Women of the World Festival in New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: Oh absolutely.  That was wonderful.  Women of the World actually started and happens every year at the Southbank Centre in London [England].  That's London's equivalent to Lincoln Center [Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, New York, New York].  Jude Kelly is the founder and they grew the Women of the World.  So people come from different parts of the world, women primarily, who want to do this festival which includes arts and social justice, and performance around women's issues, a panoply of women's issues.  And they take it to their countries.  So I had gone to the Apollo [Apollo Theater Foundation, New York, New York] when I started Journey Agent Productions to say that I would love to work with you all.  I met with Mickey [ph.], who was then the executive producer.  She and I knew each other.  She was friends with LeBaron [H. LeBaron Taylor], we knew each other from--she was at Ford [ph.] and I was at Sony Music [Sony Music Entertainment].  And I said you know, "One of my ideas is I could do personal growth workshop with your team or I could do a symposium series or you know, you should have a women's conference."  And she says, "You know, we're thinking about it and we--we did one a couple of years ago.  We just heard about this Women of the World and I'm sending our associate producer to London to go check it out and if we do it, I'll call you."  They went, checked it out and called me.  And so for the Apollo, I produced all of the panels and workshops for the Women of the World Festival, it was three or four days.  And in order to prepare for it, I figured I wanted to see it too.  So the next one coming up was in Australia.  As I joined them in June.  Over the summer we had these think ins, where we invite people from the community, from all walks of life to talk about what should be in this festival. "What do you think, who should speak, what kinds of workshops and what topics?"  But I wanted to see one in operation and the next one was in Katherine, which is in the Outback, in Australia.  So I went to Brisbane [Australia], met two of the women who were working on it there.  We flew to Darwin [Darwin International Airport, Australia] and then drove for three or four hours into the Outback.  This was the second time they were doing this with these Aboriginal women and with some of the white women who worked in--lived in Australia.  Most of them worked on ranches and some of them worked in NGOs [non-governmental organization].  That was such a powerful experience.  It was a small one, there was a couple hundred women and Katherine is a very small town.  But the relationship between Aborigines and indigenous and the majority population reminded me of the United States in the '50s [1950s].  There's such a stark social division between the black and white people.  The way that I--it was explained to me what Aboriginal means, those who were born on Australia and the indigenous are those from the islands around Australia.  And so while I was there, I read two really great books on the Aboriginal people and mostly on this translation between them.  What they remind me of is the way American Indians [Native American] are in the United States.  They live out on these settlements or reservations.  Some of them are acculturated, you know the Aboriginals went through a period of history where they were forcibly taken and children were placed with white families or placed in boarding schools so that they could dissolve them out of the population.  So some are in cities and live there, and others still live in the settlements.  There's a big alcohol problem.  The growth industry in Aborigines is kidney dialysis.  There's TB [tuberculosis], there's homelessness.  It's just--it's a different culture.  They're still very much speaking many of their own languages, but things are dying out and some are getting into the government and some are getting into communities, but many are not.  So I really enjoyed being with them, because I got a chance to see and hear them, and I got a chance to see the way that they accepted me.  When I met one of the Aboriginal leaders, one of the women who were there, who was on the town council.  The first thing she said to me was, "You know it's very prejudiced here."  And when I mentioned that to Jude, she--what started me to saying it to her was she said, "I'm wondering they're not saying much about their racial problems here in Australia."  And she said, "I--I don't know why that is."  And I said, "Well that's not my case. The first thing she said to me was--," and she said, "Well why did they tell you?"  And I said, "Because they know I understand, you know, that's why."  But I really saw how a--their--their thinking is different, their orientation to life is different.  Their spirituality is different.  So WOW is all of that, WOW is a way for women to talk about abuse or immigration or child rearing or the arts or whatever is important in women's lives.  So WOW festivals are taking place all over the world, now they're growing and it's a powerful movement in a special place.  The place--the space that they create.  There'll be another one in New York in the Apollo next year that the Apollo is sponsoring.
Story_ID: 650456
Speaker 1: Do you have a dream project that you would like to do that you have not done yet?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.  I do.  It's, it's still kind of almost even formless, but what I would love to do is something that really, as I said before, uses the visual arts and performing arts, and that people could be immersed and not just sit and watch on the stage, but be in the kind of theater space where they're in the piece itself and active in the piece, there's an interactive component.  One thing that I've experienced that's kind of close to it--close to it is something that I experienced in California.  Matthew Fox is a priest who created something called the Mass [Cosmic Mass].  Not the Mass like the Catholic church Mass.  It's the format of the Mass, but the one that I went to, the church of Agape [Agape International Spiritual Center, Culver City, California] had put on, that's Reverend Michael Beckwith [Michael Bernard Beckwith], who is one of the ministers on 'The Secret,' the film 'The Secret.'  He's got a really big multicultural congregation, New Thought congregation in L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  And it was in a hotel ballroom, but they--we were inside a round of screens where slides were--were being displayed and on the stage were live performers and there was a representative from every faith in the room when we were there, and we went from speaking to vocalizing to dancing and to--we went on a Mass, a kind of a journey through various cultures and through various life experiences which culminated with people, the folks of different things sharing what the Catholics would call Communion with each other, with all of us in the space.  And so we were giving Communion to each other.  And there's something about that cohesiveness, the use of the arts, the politics involved, the cultural elements involved.  I want to do something that does that, that allows people to be immersed in another culture or other cultures and to see our similarities and to have an experience of ourselves and each other, that is deeper than any conversation, and potent.  Because it's not the kind of thing you can experience for hours on end, it has to be kind of potent and direct, but so that we can be changed from the inside in the way that we look at ourselves, the way we look at each other and in the way that we see the destiny of the world.
Story_ID: 650457
Speaker 1: I see the vision that's being painted for the destiny of the world, if I look at television, if I look at movies.  If I look--stand in front of a magazine rack and look at the covers of newspapers, the destiny that is being visualized is one of violence, it's one of division, it's one of hatred, it's one of us against them, and there's a whole bunch of us against them.  You know, there's the ageism, and sexism, and racism, and homophobia and adultism, you know, what's happening with adults.  I had only heard the term adultism from doing a workshop with another friend of mine.  And it's about how adults laud it over kids to the point that kids are now abused and used, and enslaved and migrant farmers or factory workers or sex workers.  Children are victims so much of the time or left on their own devices.  So we have too many isms, too many phobias and I think we, those of us who feel differently or think differently have to do more than talk with each other about it.  Well that's the first step, we must talk.  But the talk must come from an enlightened vision.  And then from there must come some action.  So with the film festival [March on Washington Film Festival] with the WOW Festival [Women of the World Festival], I find as the granddaughter and daughter of teachers, and as a teacher myself and as a teacher of the arts, some of us are--we learn through what we touch.  We learn through what we write.  Some of us learn it through what we hear.  Some of us learn through what we see and smell.  Some of us learn through how we move.  I love creating those environments where all of those are brought together around the topic of how we, as a human race, can acknowledge and exalt what cultural underpinnings we have so that we can live in a world of justice and peace and love.  The true sense of love.  In the temple [Moorish Science Temple of America], I learned that love has three powers.  The power to create, the power to save, and the power to destroy.   And when I think about the destructive power of love by that I mean, people have loved me through getting rid of bad habits.  People have loved me through--we love folks through addiction, we love them through being that accountability person.  We love it through destroying everything that is unlike love, that's love's destructive power.  Love's saving power is the ways in which we save the planet, save each other, save ourselves and of course creation, we live in an ever creative universe.  Every moment, new cells come into existence, new stars come into existence, new ideas come into existence.  Nothing ends, everything grows and evolves.  When we see ourselves in that chain of ever evolving life, I think we would think about and treat each other differently, hopefully better; so that we as a human species can grow (gesture) to whatever's a better version of who we are.
Story_ID: 650458
Speaker 1: What specific hopes and concerns do you have for black communities like Hollis, New Jersey [sic.] and other--?
Speaker 2: Hollis, Queens [New York]--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and Harlem [New York, New York], and.  That we know ourselves, know who we really are.  If we knew who we really were, we would support each other more.  We would buy from each other, build our economic base, build our educational base, build our cultural institutions.  It is only when we, as an African ancestored people in our communities can be the best version of ourselves, that we can look at folks of other nationalities from a position of strength and equality.  I don't think we see ourselves truly as equal because we are seeing ourselves through the mindset of slavery and overcoming.  So there's always this overcoming kind of mentality as opposed to I am powerful, strong, cultural, full.  I have the resources that I need.  I share with my community.  Remember I said before, one of my favorite times of year is Kwanzaa, love Kwanzaa because it's principles based.  Because every day we focus on a principle, on the history, on each other, on putting it into practice and we do it with every generation.  I used to have Kwanzaa gatherings in my home with fifty or sixty people of all generations and I'd bring different theater games and cultural games so that we could live the principles and then make a dedication to each other, so that when we came together the next year, we could see things happen.  One year, one of my neighbors said her goal for Kwanzaa to experience economic independence and cooperative economics was to start a daycare center.  Two years later, my daughter [Makara Bey] was in her daycare center.  So she built a business, I became a parent, I could patronize her business in our community.  That's the kind of putting things into action that I want to see for all of us to grow and develop.
Story_ID: 650459
Speaker 1: The last two questions we ask are reflective questions and this whole section has been reflective (laughter), but, but when you look back, what do you see as your legacy at this point 'cause you're still working?
Speaker 2: As I said earlier my--the motto, that mantra I was thinking about today is, the rest of my life will be the best of my life.  Putting together my thoughts for that paper and the photographs you asked me to bring caused me to look at my life.  A lot of these pictures were in boxes and I dug them out last night and this morning.  And it gave me a chance to see all that I've done, all the people that have touched me and all the people I in turn have touched.  And so I think that as a legacy it will be the same three things that I've been talking about all along, my love of the potential for human beings to be their best and highest self.  Through understanding of who we are as a historical and cultural people and the power of our artistic expressions to bring that to life in all of us.  I feel that I have done that in all of the work that I've done, whether it's been in the entertainment industry, in radio and television or in live productions or in this film festival [March on Washington Film Festival].  I've brought a political consciousness with an artistic consciousness and a spiritual consciousness to uplift humanity.
Story_ID: 650460
Speaker 1: I know you mentioned your daughter [Makara Bey], we talked about her on some level; but tell us about your, your family including her, I mean as it is, as it's constituted today?
Speaker 2: There's something that seems to have been a concurrent theme in the generation of my family before me.  You know, when they moved, when my parents [Shirley Jones and Eustace Jones] moved and then some of their children or siblings moved.  My family is small in that I don't know many of my relatives in Guyana anymore.  I have a cousin that I'm close with there who has a daughter who is in Canada.  I have Guyanese stepbrothers and sisters, one or two of whom I'm close with, he lives in England.  Remember I said Guyanese go to London [England], used to go to London, Toronto [Canada] or New York [New York].  But I don't have a lot of immediate family beyond those people.  I have extended family, people that I've met over the years that have become like brothers and sisters to me that are the family that I pulled together.  When my daughter has an occasion, you know, her graduation or her birthday, these are people who are her aunties and uncles that have been my lifelong friends.  So that is family to me and I think about that a lot as my daughter gets older.  I'm, what, almost forty years older than my daughter, so there'll be a time when I won't be here and I'm hoping that she feels connected enough to these people who are extended family that she'll feel like they're family for her.  But that is something I will just have to hope that she has within herself the kinds of things that I thought my parents put in me.  You know, when my mother died, I was eighteen.  It was important for me to be independent and it wasn't even something that I was conscious of.  Having gone to boarding school [Academy of St. Joseph, Brentwood, New York], I learned how to be independent, I learned how to live away from family and so I was not deterred about moving to another city or getting my own place.  It seemed exciting.  And I'm hoping for her it's the same, because what I can't provide in cousins and aunts and uncles, I hope that I have in an extended family that feels like family to her; and that she knows how to make family out of the friends that she has.
Story_ID: 650461
Speaker 1: Our last question, similar to legacy but a little bit different.  Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: (Pause) I would like to be remembered as someone who did her best to love beyond the limits of my prejudices, to live the life that I feel I was destined to live and to share with people all that I have to share.
Speaker 1: All right, well thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Story_ID: 650462
Speaker 1: So, I think I'm about five years old; and that was one of the ships my father worked on.  So that was when he had docked and we came to the dock to meet him.
Speaker 2: About what year is this?
Speaker 1: I'm five--'58 [1958].
Speaker 2: Yeah, '58 [1958].
Speaker 1: That's my wedding picture.  So, next to my--my--all of us were in the Moorish Science Temple [Moorish Science Temple of America].  There's my--my husband's best man on the end in the purple, Amemine Bey [ph.] and that's me, my husband, Musa Bey [ph.] and Isato [ph.] who is the woman who introduced me to the adoption agent I later met (unclear) and her two little girls who are now forty and thirty-eight, (laughter) kids of their own.
Speaker 2: That is the moment my daughter [Makara Bey] and I met in Cambodia at the orphanage.  They had just woken her up from a hammock nap and she was looking at me for the first time.
Speaker 1: That's my father, Eustace Jones and my husband, Musa at our wedding.
Speaker 2: That's the house my mother grew up in in Guyana, the village of Buxton.
Speaker 1: Yes, me.  Think a little young, about two or so.
Speaker 2: That is my father around the time my mother and father were married.
Speaker 1: That's Eustace?
Speaker 2: Eustace Jones.
Speaker 1: My mother, Shirley Jones.  That's around when she first came to America.
Speaker 2: The top picture is me at the--at FESPACO, the Panafrican Film Festival [Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou] representing Sony Pictures [Sony Pictures Entertainment] with Saundra Sharp [HistoryMaker S. Pearl Sharp] who was a California filmmaker.
Speaker 1: We interviewed her.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 1: One of my corporate head shots around the time I became vice president of corporate affairs at Sony Music [Sony Music Entertainment].
Speaker 2: My daughter was eight years old in this picture.  The woman who was the photographer gave us a gift of a portrait.
Speaker 1: She's kind of tall?
Speaker 2: She was standing on something.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Oh these are--my mother is the second from the left and these are all Guyanese women.  They were all politically active and working towards independence and had a benevolence society.
Speaker 1: So this is what we call my naturalization papers.  This is my certificate at registration in the Moorish Science Temple [Moorish Science Temple of America] in the Moorish School of Law and History [Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 2: And this is a reprint of an article that was in The Baltimore Sun around the time of the case that I mentioned with the IRS [Internal Revenue Service] that we took to supreme court--circuit court [Circuit Court for Baltimore County]. Yeah.
Speaker 1: The photograph that I took announcing my promotion.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Those were some of the Moors and our attorney who was doing the case for us.
