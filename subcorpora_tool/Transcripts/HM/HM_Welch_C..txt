Story_ID: 632908
Speaker 1: Let's delve into your family history a little bit. What's your mother's name?
Speaker 2: My mother is Lyda Constance Merrick Watts [Lyda Merrick Watts].
Speaker 1: And when was she born and where?
Speaker 2: She was born in Durham [North Carolina] also, in 1920.
Speaker 1: What was her profession?
Speaker 2: She was a homemaker by profession, but also a volunteer extraordinaire in the community. Most of the time doing things with numbers (laughter), accounting and treasurer of things and that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Was she educated?
Speaker 2: Yes, she was educated well.
Speaker 1: What schools did she attend?
Speaker 2: She graduated from Palmer Memorial Institute [Alice Freeman Palmer Memorial Institute, Sedalia, North Carolina] for high school, and then went to Talladega College [Talladega, Alabama] in Alabama for undergrad. And then she took some courses at Columbia University [New York, New York] in economics.
Speaker 1: And do you know your maternal grandparents' names?
Speaker 2: Yes. Lyda Moore Merrick was my mother's mother. And Edward R. Merrick [Edward Merrick], Edward Richard Merrick was her grandfather [sic. father].
Speaker 1: When was her mother born?
Speaker 2: Now, well I do have those dates, let me--I think I have those dates here. Yeah. No, I don't have it.
Speaker 1: Okay, where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Durham, they were both born in Durham.
Speaker 1: Did Lyda have a profession?
Speaker 2: Lyda was a homemaker, she was an artist, she was a musician. She painted oil paintings often of portraits for people, or buildings were dedicated in town. She also taught piano lessons, played for the choir, played at church, organist. And she was a, also a, a community volunteer. She founded the Negro Braille Magazine [Merrick Washington Magazine for the Blind], and continued as chair of the board of the Durham Colored Library organization [Durham Colored Library, Inc., Durham, North Carolina] until it was incorporated into the, the county, Durham County library system [Durham County Library] and became Stanford L. Warren Library [Stanford L. Warren Branch Library, Durham, North Carolina].
Speaker 1: So tell me a little bit about the Durham Colored Library. Why was there a need for this library and when did this happen?
Speaker 2: The Durham Colored Library was founded by my great-grandfather, my mother's mother's father, Aaron Moore [Aaron McDuffie Moore], in a church, White Rock Baptist Church [Durham, North Carolina], and I don't have those dates. But it was probably in early, the mid-1900s because he died in about 1920, so it was early 1900s before he died, when he founded it in White Rock Baptist Church because he saw a need for African American community to have access to books. He was a veracious reader himself, he was very religious, always reading the Bible and other things. And as the country doctor visiting people's homes, saw a lot of needs that they had and tried to find ways to help the families with more than just medicine. That probably was one of the reasons he was interested in founding the insurance company [North Carolina Mutual and Provident Association; North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company, Durham, North Carolina] when the idea came about.
Speaker 1: Okay. So let's go back there, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Back to the library?
Speaker 1: Your grandmother was Lyda.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Your mother was also Lyda.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother was Lyda Constance, my grandmother was Lyda Vivian, actually. Lyda Vivian Moore Merrick.
Speaker 1: And tell--who were her parents? Lyda Vivian Moore Merrick.
Speaker 2: Aaron Moore and Sarah McCotta Dancy Moore [Sarah Dancy Moore], or Sarah, did I say that backwards? Was Sarah, no it's correct. Dancy was her maiden name.
Story_ID: 632909
Speaker 1: So you were starting to tell me about Dr. Aaron Moore [Aaron McDuffie Moore].
Speaker 2: I was starting to tell you about the library [Durham Colored Library, Inc.; Stanford L. Warren Branch Library, Durham, North Carolina], why they needed a library. And he founded that library in the church [White Rock Baptist Church, Durham, North Carolina] because there was no place for African Americans in, in Durham [North Carolina] to access books freely, freely access books outside of academic community.
Speaker 1: And this was the second colored library in the State of North Carolina (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In the State of North Carolina. There was another one in Winston-Salem [North Carolina] I believe.
Speaker 1: And Dr. Aaron Moore was educated where?
Speaker 2: He was educated at Shaw University [Raleigh, North Carolina] in the Leonard school of medicine [Leonard Medical School]. He grad- they had a medical school at Shaw at that time. He came from Columbus County, North Carolina, where there was--he was--it was an agrarian, a lot of land that his family, his grandparents' family had acquired after they were slaves. And lots of cousins and, you know, lots of children as farming families often have to help on the family farm. But he was--he always wanted to go to college and he was obviously very smart. And he came to Shaw and finished Shaw undergrad and medical school.
Speaker 1: So--but he was raised on a farm.
Speaker 2: He was raised on a farm in eastern Carolina.
Speaker 1: Do you know what kind of farm, cotton, tobacco?
Speaker 2: Probably tobacco, yeah, tobacco.
Speaker 1: Was this land inherited?
Speaker 2: Yes. It was--the story is that the, Benjamin [Benjamin Spaulding, Sr.] who was as far back as we can trace, was a, was a, a son of a slave owner and one of his slaves. So Benjamin's mom was a slave, and the slave owner. And he looked white, and he was raised in the household. And the story goes that he actually was a little bit arrogant, or he didn't always obey. He didn't want to be treated as a slave and he disobeyed. And his father [Samuel Swindell, Sr.], master hit him and he fell sprawling. And then eventually adopted the name Spaulding instead of Sprawling. But he was called Benjamin Sprawling for a while. And he didn't perform well as a slave and I guess there must have been some relationship with this master, and the master sold him the land when he, he gave him his freedom and he earned money and bought the land from his master.
Speaker 1: And this was somewhere in the 1800s.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Um-hm. So--
Speaker 1: The mid-1800s before emancipation?
Speaker 2: It was, must have been before emancipation, yeah. So he bought this land, he married [Edith Freeman Spaulding], he had ten- he had eight children, one of which was a daughter. And the daughter married a Moore.
Speaker 1: So what was his daughter's name?
Speaker 2: His daughter's name was, what do I have here? (Laughter) This is like I really should learn this.
Speaker 1: Eliza Spaulding [Anna Spaulding Moore]?
Speaker 2: Eliza Spaulding was his daughter's name. And she married Israel Moore [Israel Moore, Sr.]. And they had ten children. And Aaron Moore is one of those sons.
Speaker 1: And they were farmers, Eliza and Israel Moore?
Speaker 2: I, I am not sure. I have, I have made assumptions that this whole family stayed together on this, this property and you know, built houses and stayed together, sort of as an enclave. And knew each other and grew up, most of them grew up there. The ones who wanted to go to college, or better themselves, Aaron ended up bringing to Durham because there was North Carolina Central University [National Religious Training School and Chautauqua for the Colored Race; North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina] here that he had also had a hand in founding. And this was where they would come and stay with him. He would let them stay in his home and they could go to school and sort of help out around the house. But basically get an education and a lot of them became employees of the mutual [North Carolina Mutual and Provident Association; North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company, Durham, North Carolina] as well, and the families had some economic stability because of all of that.
Story_ID: 632910
Speaker 1: So Aaron [Aaron McDuffie Moore] lived 1856 to 1923.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Was he a leader in the community?
Speaker 2: Yeah, obviously so, right. He was the, he was first a physician, and then because of what he saw people needed, he became more involved with other ideas. But he wasn't alone with this, I mean with organizing the mutual [North Carolina Mutual and Provident Association; North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company, Durham, North Carolina]. In the beginning there were a group of men who came together, including Aaron and John Merrick. But there were several and their pictured here in the early forming of the country- the company. And at one point when the first claim due, the story goes that several backed out except for Aaron Moore and John Merrick and they paid the first claim. And then they began to continue. But neither of them needed the company income, they both had their own careers. John Merrick owned barbershops, he had--he was first a brick mason, and then he built these barbershops, he had three barbershops. So he had economic stability without the mutual. It was an entrepreneurship that they could afford to invest in and help to grow. Neither of them ever took salaries from the company. C.C. Spaulding [Charles Clinton Spaulding] came as a cousin of Aaron Moore's to Durham [North Carolina] to work in the company sort of as a, a busboy, gofer, whatever, and learn the business from them and then was their first salesman and really brought the company into the next level of growth. And from his entrepreneurial spirit, it became more well-known nationwide and grew with branch offices and that kind of thing. He knew Roosevelt [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt], President Roosevelt and Booker T. Washington and, you know, he was, he was, the, the person who--he was the president, probably the first paid president at that point.
Speaker 1: Who was the first president?
Speaker 2: First president was John Merrick. And then Aaron Moore and then C.C. Spaulding.
Story_ID: 632911
Speaker 1: Aaron Moore [Aaron McDuffie Moore] was married to Sarah McCotta Dancy Moore [Sarah Dancy Moore], and they called her Cottie Moore and sometimes we called her Palm [ph.] also.
Speaker 2: (LYDA MERRICK WATTS): The grandchildren called her Palm.
Speaker 1: The grandchildren called her Palm.
Speaker 2: And was she educated?
Speaker 1: I don't know. I, I know that her--in, in some writings that I've found, it says that she came from Tarboro, North Carolina.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: So Aaron Moore was married to Sarah McCotta Dancy Moore.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Was she a homemaker?
Speaker 2: Yes, she was a homemaker, and she was also a volunteer in the community. I've read where she was a leader in the Federation of Women's Clubs [North Carolina Federation of Negro Women's Clubs] and they did a lot of community work. She also volunteered at the hospital, at Lincoln Hospital [Durham, North Carolina], folding bandages for the war, that kind of thing. But she was--she had beautiful crocheted afghans that she did. She was a seamstress as well. She had two girls, my grandmother Lyda [Lyda Moore Merrick] and her sister Mattie Louise [Mattie Moore McDougald]. And they were sent to Barber-Scotia [Scotia Seminary; Barber-Scotia College, Concord, North Carolina] for their high school years, a private school for African Americans. And then they both went to Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee]. And she was proud of them. I remember Palm. She was still living when I was born and lived here. And I just remember her being warm and, you know, always telling jokes and always had a lot of women around that she was good friends with and they did a lot of good things for the community, and they had a lot of fun. Active in the church as well.
Speaker 1: So Aaron and Sarah gave birth as you said to Mattie Louise Moore McDougald and Lyda Vivian.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell me about Lyda. Do you know what year she was born?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: The early 1900s?
Speaker 2: Yes. She was--I can't tell you the exact year. I know she was born in November, know her birthday was November 7th.
Speaker 1: Was she educated?
Speaker 2: Yes, she went to Fisk University, she finished Fisk University.
Speaker 1: Did she finish Fisk--do you have an idea of when?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Do you know what she studied?
Speaker 2: She studied music. And then she also took some music graduate work at Columbia University [New York, New York] afterwards, and art, painting.
Speaker 1: And she's known for institution building as well. She was the founder of what?
Speaker 2: Well she ultimately founded a Negro braille magazine called, now called the Merrick Washington Magazine for the Blind. At that point they did name it the Negro Braille Magazine. You know she had the freedom because of my grandfather's stability at the mutual [North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company, Durham, North Carolina], Ed Merrick [Edward Merrick] as treasurer of the mutual. And in that era, she didn't have to work. She was able to do things as a volunteer. And she volunteered at both the hospital [Lincoln Hospital, Durham, North Carolina] and at the library and following in her father's footsteps with the interest in the library. She actually was chair of the board of the Durham Colored Library [Durham Colored Library, Inc.; Stanford L. Warren Branch Library, Durham, North Carolina] until the county absorbed that library and it became a part of the county library system.
Story_ID: 632912
Speaker 1: But in her [Welch's maternal grandmother, Lyda Moore Merrick] volunteer work, she met a young man who was blind from birth. He was actually abandoned at birth in Lincoln Hospital [Durham, North Carolina] and her dad [Aaron McDuffie Moore] brought him to her because he was this baby nobody claimed. And he, she had him at her house as a baby and he was only a few months older than my mother [Lyda Merrick Watts]. My mother was crawling--maybe a few months younger than my mother. My mother was crawling around. She had a sister [Mattie Moore McDougald] three years older, and here she was with this young, blind baby. And I just can't picture that, you know. And then she was giving her time to him. But she kept in touch with him. Eventually, he was able to go to a state school for the blind.
Speaker 2: So he came into their home in the early 1920s.
Speaker 1: Yes. It was, it was in the earl- my mom was born in 1920, so it would have been '24 [1924], maybe '23 [1923].
Speaker 2: And what was his name?
Speaker 1: His name was John Washington, John Carter Washington.
Speaker 2: How long did he remain in the home?
Speaker 1: I believe he was only there a few months, and then they found a foster home for him. And my grandmother just stayed in touch with him after that. And she did help him to get admitted to the state school for the blind. And then he would come back to Durham [North Carolina], you know, between on vacation times. And she read to a group of blind people in the library. They had a corner in Stanford L. Warren Library [Durham Colored Library, Inc.; Stanford L. Warren Branch Library, Durham, North Carolina] called the Braille Corner, and she would--or the Blind Corner. And she would read to them from magazines and from books that they couldn't--that weren't published in Braille. And a lot of it was about African American achievements, not just history, but achievements in--that were published in magazines like Jet magazine and Ebony magazine, and The Crisis magazine and all of the newspapers. They kept those in that library, the Afro-American [Afro-American Newspapers] was an old newspaper, The Carolina Times, you know, focusing on happenings in African American community. And Mr. Washington asked my mother, and she called him Johnny, if he could ple- if she could help him to figure out how he could read those himself. He could read Braille, and he wanted to be able to read that information on his own, not have somebody have to read it to him. And so she took that kernel of an idea and began clipping articles out of these magazines and newspapers and sending them to a publisher who would turn them into a magazine and publish it in braille. And I remember we lived in her house when my dad [Charles DeWitt Watts] came back to practice medicine here in Durham. So up--from the time I was in about the, I guess I was about four years old, until I was nine, we lived in that house and Mr. Washington would come to read the edited, the copy to be edited. And he would sit in there and he would be sitting in the living room, telling my grandmother where there were editorial errors in the braille. And she would make notes and send them back to the publisher. The publisher would correct them and then she would send the publisher lists of places to mail that magazine to people to mail it to readers.
Speaker 2: So this was pretty revolutionary.
Speaker 1: It was, and it's very--it's sort of a best kept secret I think. I'm not sure there's very much been written about it. And she did this out of her pocket, she funded it out of her pocket until she decided to retire. She said, you know I'm gonna do one more, and she did it. I think three or four times a year she published it. So she was always clipping articles, she always had a folder of these articles. And I knew as a child around the house that those were the Braille Magazine [Negro Braille Magazine; Merrick Washington Magazine for the Blind] articles and, you know I was maybe in the fourth grade when we moved out of that house. So I could understand what she was doing. And when she decided that she couldn't do, keep up with it, she would say. She always wrote a letter from the editor in the beginning of it. The community rallied around and wanted to see the magazine continue. And mom always, my mother always kept the, the books for it once it was a non-profit organization. And they absorbed it into the Durham Colored Library, Inc., turned it into a 501(c)(3). Hired someone who would part time do what my grandmother had done, clip articles and send them to that publisher. So it's continuing now.
Story_ID: 632913
Speaker 1: Lyda Vivian Moore Merrick [Lyda Moore Merrick] had children (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And we called her Lybo.
Speaker 1: Lybo.
Speaker 2: That was her name the grandchildren gave her because my grandfather, Ed [Edward Merrick], would come in from--well whenever he wanted to talk to her, he always called her Lyda Moore. You know Lyda Moore and it got faster and faster, it was Lydamo, Lydamo, Lydamo. And my first cousin, my oldest cousin heard that and was trying to call her that and ended up with Lybo. So everybody called her Lybo. And so you know, that's just--that was her name to me.
Speaker 1: And she had children.
Speaker 2: She had two daughters, my mother Constance, Lyda Constance Merrick Watts [Lyda Merrick Watts] and her daughter Vivian McCotta Sansom, Merrick Sansom [Vivian Merrick Sansom] who now lives in Raleigh [North Carolina].
Speaker 1: And where did Vivian go to school?
Speaker 2: Mama and Vivian both went to Talladega [Talladega College, Talladega, Alabama] and to Palmer [Alice Freeman Palmer Memorial Institute, Sedalia, North Carolina] together. Vivian was three years older than my mom.
Speaker 1: And then Lyda Constance Merrick Watts gave birth to you and your siblings.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So tell me about your siblings, the order of birth and names.
Speaker 2: I'm the oldest. And--
Speaker 1: And you're Eileen [HistoryMaker C. Eileen Watts Welch].
Speaker 2: I'm Eileen, they call me Eileen. I'm Constance Eileen. I always sign my name C. Eileen in honor of my mom. And then my sister right under me, three years younger is, was Deborah Chase Watts [Deborah Watts Hill] and later Hill, married.
Speaker 1: What year was she born?
Speaker 2: She was in 1949. And my brother Charles Watts, Jr., Charles DeWitt Watts, Jr., was born in 1955. And then my sister, the baby, Winifred Anita Hemphill, Winifred Anita Watts Hemphill [Winifred Watts Hemphill], was born in 1960.
Story_ID: 632914
Speaker 1: And what about your father's family? Do you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --about the lineage there?
Speaker 2: Yes. Dad grew up in Atlanta, Georgia. He finished Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: And tell me your father's name again.
Speaker 2: Charles DeWitt Watts, Sr., M.D. [Charles DeWitt Watts] (laughter). He, he went to high school at a laboratory high school at Spelman College [Atlanta University Laboratory School, Atlanta, Georgia]. And he was born in 1917, September 1917. And then he went to Morehouse College and finished in biology or mathematics I believe. And a couple of years later ended up going to medical school at Howard University [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] because he had to earn some money in between to be able to afford it. His mother's [Ida Hawes Watts] side of the family was the Hawes. His mother's mother [Janie Glover Hawes], I mean his mother's father [Hampton Hawes]--I guess the, the mother was a full bled, full bread Cherokee Indian [Native American] full blood Cherokee Indian. And the father was a slave, a freed slave. And they lived in Macon, Georgia. And they had some property, and that property is still in the family.
Speaker 1: You know their names?
Speaker 2: I don't know their names. Do I have the names here? No, I don't have their--his name was Lewis, Lewis G. Watts [Lewis G. Watts, Sr.], but I don't--no, I take that back. That was my dad's father. I don't know the Hawes' names, I just know he was called--I, I really don't know his name. I need to find that out. But they, they, they did have several children on a farm in Macon, Georgia. And they had three older daughters, Ida, Ada [Ada Hawes Hinton] and Ella [Ella Hawes], and they called them Stata, Stayta, Stella, Sister, Sister Ida, Sister Ada, Sister Ella. And then they had two sons, Elmo [ph.] and DeWitt [DeWitt Hawes]. And then they had two other daughters, Maxie [Maxie Hawes] and May [ph.]. And I remember DeWitt, May and Maxie. The rest of them I think had passed before I was born. And I know DeWitt didn't have any children at all. Aunt May was very helpful to my father during the time he was trying to finance his medical education, and they had a very close relationship as an aunt and nephew. He told the story about her wanting to learn how to drive, she was a social worker. And she was educated. I think all of those children were educated. And she never could learn to drive. So she, she hired somebody to teach her how to drive, but had my father ride with them. And he was probably fourteen or fifteen. But he learned how to drive before she did and ultimately became her chauffeur.
Story_ID: 632915
Speaker 1: I wanted to say one, one of the phenomenal things about my father's [Charles DeWitt Watts] side and my mother's [Lyda Merrick Watts] side is there was so much education way back when. My dad's--both sides of his family, his mother's side and his father's side, all of their siblings were educated. Her--his mother and father met at Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] when they were both--you know it was a normal school then, it was not a graduate school. But they were both in school, she coming up there from Macon [Georgia] to Atlanta [Georgia]. And he in Atlanta, had been in Atlanta. His father had been in Atlanta. But he dropped out of school and she finished because his father died and he needed to go home to help his par- his mother with the rest of the children. And I believe he was the oldest of five or six sisters. And his father owned a grocery store. He went home to finish, to run that grocery store because that was their source of support. But they stayed, they kept writing and they stayed in touch. And eventually who I call Grandma Watts, Ida Hawes Watts, came back to Atlanta and they got married. And that's--there's--I have this wonderful picture of them on their wedding day with a horse drawn carriage taking them away to their honeymoon. But they both were very committed to both sides of their family, she being one of the older girls.
Speaker 2: Who was this?
Speaker 1: My, my grandmother Ida, Ida Hawes Watts. And she being the oldest of all of these girls. All of those girls came and lived at their house during the time that they were having their own children. And they helped those girls, these aunts on both sides, finish Spelman Uni- Spelman College [Spelman Seminary; Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia]. So there's--you know, they became teachers and they--some of them never married because if they were teachers back then, you couldn't marry and keep teaching. So, but there was some--several old maid aunts, and some became social workers and some became, you know, they married. Some married, one [Ada Hawes Hinton] married a Dr. Hinton [William Augustus Hinton] who was the first physician at--black physician out of Harvard Medical School [Boston, Massachusetts]. And that's another story, I can't tell you all of it. But it's a story that should be told.
Speaker 2: So your maternal grandmother.
Speaker 1: My pater- my paternal grandmother.
Speaker 2: Okay, your paternal grandmother.  So tell me about their, so tell me about Ida Hawes Watts (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Ida, Ida Hawes Watts finished Atlanta University. I, I think she was born in 1901. I think that's what she used to say--or did she finish AU in 1901? I don't know, but anyway (laughter).
Speaker 2: This is your father's mother.
Speaker 1: That's my father's mother. So we have to figure those dates out. But she finished Atlanta University, went back to the farm in Macon to teach in Macon I believe, for a little while. And then ended up coming back to Atlanta to marry Lewis Watts [Lewis G. Watts, Sr.]. And she during her--she--they had four children, my dad was the baby. The oldest was Aunt Jane, who is the only daughter, Jane Watts. And then Lewis, no Albert Watts [Albert Hawes Watts], and then Lewis Watts [Lewis G. Watts, Jr.] and then Charles. So they had four children, one a daughter. Jane died early, she had multiple sclerosis and, and I remember Grandma Watts helping her through that with--she had only one son. Uncle Albert was there when I was at Spelman helping me through, taking me to First Congregational Church [First Congregational Church of Atlanta, United Church of Christ, Atlanta, Georgia], running the cemetery. He was a good uncle to me. Uncle Lewis moved in, he finished Brandeis University [Waltham, Massachusetts], was a social worker, moved out to Seattle, Washington and raised his family out there. We still stay in touch with his family, he's passed. So Daddy was the last of his siblings to pass away about two years ago, 2004. So her husband Lewis Watts, who came home to run that grocery store. He had all these sisters and I can't think of all the sisters, there was Nellie [Nellie Watts] and Carrie [Carrie Watts] and several other sisters who finished Spelman under their roof and lived in--all over the country. Moved to Detroit [Michigan] and different places. I know one of the daughters of one of the sisters who still lives is Laura [ph.], and she lives in Detroit. And I've been meaning to touch base with her to get more information about her mother, but I don't have any of that in writing. But in other words, they were all educated at least with a secondary education. And I think in that era and that time it wasn't normal for African American families to have that accomplishment.
Story_ID: 632916
Speaker 1: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And then you were born in 1946?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Tell me about your siblings.
Speaker 1: I've listed them for you (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, but they were all--everybody was educated.
Speaker 1: Yes. Actually, I finished Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] and then I finished George Mason [George Mason University, Fairfax, Virginia] with a M.B.A. in management, marketing and public relations. And then my sister, Debbie [Deborah Watts Hill], finished UNCG [University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Greensboro, North Carolina], and then went to Bryn Mawr [Bryn Mawr College, Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania] and almost had her Ph.D., that she got posthumously. She passed away from breast cancer in 1992 I believe. My brother, Chuck, Charles Watts, Jr. [Charles DeWitt Watts, Jr.], works here at North Carolina Mutual [North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company, Durham, North Carolina]. He's the general counsel and vice president, senior vice president. He did finish Howard University [Washington, D.C.], no he finished UNC [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina], he would kill me. He finished UNC undergrad and then he finished Howard University for a law degree. And he went to Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana] for an M.B.A. And then my sister, Winnie, Winifred Anita Watts Hemphill [Winifred Watts Hemphill], finished Howard University undergrad and, and for law school. And she works and practices in Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 2: Okay. And you were born here in Durham [North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Yep, we were all born in Durham.
Speaker 2: What's your earliest (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Except for Debbie, Debbie was born in, in--at Freedmen's Hospital [Howard University Hospital] in, in D.C. [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: D.C.
Story_ID: 632917
Speaker 1: What's your earliest childhood memory here in Durham [North Carolina] at home?
Speaker 2: My absolute earliest childhood memory in Durham is after we came back to Durham after Debbie [Deborah Watts Hill] was--after--I was a little girl. It was before Debbie was born, it was before I was three years old. And we lived in this duplex house down on Fayetteville Street across from NCCU [North Carolina College at Durham; North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina]. And the lady next door was Vie Turner [Viola Mitchell Turner], who actually was my [maternal] granddad's assistant and became the first woman treasurer at North Carolina Mutual [North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company, Durham, North Carolina]. But she lived next door and she didn't have any children, but she had a Great Dane dog. And in the backyard of that duplex there was a fence that separated the two backyards. And Ms. Vie's dog was out there getting ready to jump that fence one day when I was toddling around. I remember my mother having a fit, and I thought it was a neat dog. But from then I was kind of scared of dogs (laughter). But that's my first memory in Durham of that, that big Great Dane dog bounding over the fence and my mom screaming to the top of her voice. But I have great memories of Durham because I lived with my [maternal] grandmother, we lived at my grandmother's house. After we went back to D.C. [Washington, D.C.] for Dad [Charles DeWitt Watts] to get his surgical residency over with, we came back, and in that period we lived right in my grandmother's house and we walked (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Which grandmother?
Speaker 2: Lybo, Lyda Merrick [Lyda Moore Merrick]. And stories from that house in that timeframe are very vivid. We used to--every day when my grandfather would come home from work--
Speaker 1: And your grandfather being?
Speaker 2: Ed Merrick [Edward Merrick]. The kids would hide and it was our game. And we would just hide wherever, my sister [Deborah Watts Hill] and I, it was just the two of us. We would sing, "Granddaddy, come find me. Granddaddy, come find me." And he would pretend he didn't know where we were. You knew we were singing, we were hiding, all right, under the dining room table or something really obvious, in a closet. "Granddaddy, come find me." And he would go around the house, he'd say, "Where are those young'uns? Where are those young'uns?" And then eventually he would decide it was time to let us know he knew and he would toss his hat under the dining room table, wherever we were. And it was--I mean he was so much fun. He always had us laughing and giggling and playing with us when he was at home.
Speaker 1: Did your grandmother play piano for you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she played piano. She used to have us sing for her Dorcas club meetings. I remember this song 'I Believe,' you know, (singing) "I believe for every drop of rain that falls a flower grows. I believe--." Well she played that on the piano and my sister and I had to sing while she played. And we had this Nancy doll, which was one of the first dolls that were black, was black. And it squealed. And when it said, "A baby cried," we would go (makes noise) (laughter). And all the ladies just thought that was so cute. So--but we, we had a--she was home with us a lot. And you know, Mom was, was there too, but actually Mom had a lot of club meetings and things that she was doing. But we were--
Speaker 1: What were some of the clubs?
Speaker 2: She did--I know she was active in the Deltas [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.]. At one point I believe she was president of the Durham Delta chapter. And she was, you know we--Lybo was there and so she had a lot of more freedom to kind of go and come. She didn't have to go find babysitters.
Speaker 1: Was your mom, well Lyda Constance Merrick [Lyda Merrick Watts], was she involved in Links [The Links, Incorporated] at all?
Speaker 2: She was, she was involved. But The Links chapter didn't come to Durham until I guess, what is it, 19--it was in the '50s [1950s], it was maybe '55 [1955] I think. She didn't--the, the--she was a charter member of the chapter that was founded in Durham, and it was after I was probably in elementary school or junior high school maybe, that that involvement happened.
Story_ID: 632918
Speaker 1: Tell me your memories of your [maternal] grandfather [Edward Merrick] in the house. Did you realize that he was a force?
Speaker 2: No. (Laughter) I don't think most kids know. Except to--you know later I did. When I--maybe in high school or even in junior high school I began to understand the impact of North Carolina Mutual [North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company] on the--on Durham [North Carolina], and the, the value of employment and all the things that we had here that weren't other places that I visited. I mean I went to camp once and just got a feeling, an understanding about other places where African Americans didn't have what we had in Durham, you know. I remember going downtown shopping with my [maternal] grandmother once. She, she sewed a lot. She was a seamstress. She made all her clothes and would sew for us and she would always make her hats for church to match her outfit. She kept scraps of things and redid hats, whatever she was gonna wear that Sunday was, was always unique and, and interesting. But the ladies and the seamstress in the fabric departments in Baldwin's Department Store downtown Durham, knew her. She would go and they knew she could buy what she wanted to buy. And they would be very helpful, and she taught me about how to feel the fabric and okay this is silk, or this is wool, or this is cotton and you know I kind of learned that from her and I used to sew. I used to make my own clothes. But this lady was so helpful in the store. And the other thing is you couldn't try on hats in the store if you were black. You had to, you know, they didn't think your hair--they thought your hair would dirty up the hats. So you, you couldn't do some things in the store. But she was all over us, essentially. You know, "Ms. Merrick [Lyda Moore Merrick] this, Ms. Merrick that. Can I help you Ms. Merrick? Do you want this?" Pulling down bolts of fabric for her to look at, you know, trying to sell her more fabric. And so we left, she bought what she wanted and we left and we were walking down the street. And you couldn't eat anywhere except at the mutual unless you stood up. At Silver's five and dime [Durham, North Carolina], they had a hot dog stand and you could stand and have a hot dog. But you couldn't sit at the counters. It was before the sit-ins. So we were just walking down the street and I think we were heading somewhere. And this lady came out and I realized it was the same lady. And she did not even recognize us. She walked right past us like we were not there. And I must have been nine or ten years old. And I told my grandmother, I said, "Isn't that the same lady that was just talking to you in the store?" And she said, "Don't worry about it, don't worry about it, honey. It's okay." But that was when it first struck me that you know, yeah they wanted--and I remember later. Maybe then it didn't strike me, but they wanted her to buy from 'em, but they didn't want her--they, they wouldn't even say good afternoon if they saw her on the street. And you know I think our, our--this, my generation began to see those things and then we became more radical, or you know we were the ones that had the sit-ins and we were the ones. And my senior year in Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] was the year that Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed in '68 [1968]. That was the year I graduated and you know. So I saw a lot of that and--I saw the bus station with the Jim Crow signs.
Speaker 1: Tell me what you saw in downtown Durham. Did you see those signs here?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, black and white water fountains. We really couldn't go to the bathroom anywhere unless we came into the mutual building. There weren't black and white bathrooms. There were white bathrooms. And I know from now working at Duke [Duke University, Durham, North Carolina] in one of the hospitals, the older building, there's tons of bathrooms and tons of water fountains and, you know, people say why do they have so many water fountains and bathrooms? They've actually turned some of the bathrooms in the offices--it was because we had to have black and white bathrooms, and they had to have black and white water fountains, so they had to have two (laughter), you know. So the, the remnants are still, still here in the South.
Story_ID: 632919
Speaker 1: Did anybody have multicultural relationships? Like did you have any friends who were white?
Speaker 2: Growing up, no. I, I remember I went to camp in the--in Pennsylvania, and that was the first time I was ever in an, in a place where there were other white chil- white and black children.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the camp?
Speaker 2: It was Camp Oak Hill [Nottingham, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Where was this?
Speaker 2: In Pennsylvania somewhere. In the mountains of Pennsylvania. I don't know how mom [Lyda Merrick Watts] and dad [Charles DeWitt Watts] heard about it or, or why we selected it for, for us to go. But somebody must have told them it was a nice place. It was nice. It had cabins and, in, you know, in-ground pool and lake and horses and all that.
Speaker 1: In the 1950s?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's, yeah, early, late '50s [1950s]. And we--I loved horseback riding. I was very--I loved swimming, I always swam. Archery, I remember that was the first time I ever archery. But having that sort of in the same tent with other white kids was really different for me.
Speaker 1: Were they kind to you?
Speaker 2: I don't think they were anything. I mean I think they were northern. I think they were accepting, but they weren't best friends. Because I remember the pen pals after camp were not them. You know I had--there was two or three people I remember, we wrote let--in between camp I went to it three years in a row, to the same place. And we wrote and we had still sort of separated ourselves socially. But it, it was different, you know.
Story_ID: 632920
Speaker 1: Now you were part of a prominent family here, both the Merricks and the Moores. That was a--was that a big deal?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I was known as Ms. Merrick's [Lyda Moore Merrick] granddaughter (laughter). And it was, it was okay. It was nice to get away, though. I remember thinking I would never go to college here. I wanted to go to college somewhere where I could be me. And that's why I chose to go to Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: What were holidays like in your home as a young girl?
Speaker 2: Beautiful.
Speaker 1: Tell me about a favorite Christmas.
Speaker 2: Well, I can think as a little girl, having this long list of things I would see in the catalogs that I would write my letter to Santa Claus. And I remember I wanted a Betsy Wetsy doll (laughter). And I got it. And I was so excited. So--
Speaker 1: Was this a, a black doll or a white doll?
Speaker 2: That was probably a white doll. I don't think, yeah. I did have Nancy, which was that doll that we squeezed for the song, and it was a black doll. But it didn't have the--Betsy Wetsy didn't come in black.
Speaker 1: Do you remember your father's medical practice?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Tell me about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he had a strong medical practice. He was--I, I--from my perspective, I knew it from people saying your dad helped me, or your dad, you know in church there was one lady who would say, "Thank god for Dr. Watts [Charles DeWitt Watts]. You know, I wouldn't be here if I wasn't, if it wasn't for him." And then in, in high school [Hillside High School, Durham, North Carolina], I worked in his office in summers. I would go in and help the secretary with filing and do things like that, and make appointments and greet people. And you know he was very well-respected. He was the first black board certified surgeon in North Carolina. And he talks about how he sort of went up that ladder. You had to have referrals and he was able to connect through some of the Duke [Duke University, Durham, North Carolina] physicians to get referrals to be able to, be able to even sit for the boards in the state.
Speaker 1: He practiced at Lincoln Hospital [Durham, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Yes, that was the only place he could practice until later. He then--they integrated the hospital, Watts Hospital [Durham, North Carolina] was oddly the name of the white hospital, nothing to do with us. And he did practice there near the end of his retirement--near the beginning, near the end of his practice before retirement.
Story_ID: 632921
Speaker 1: Tell me about your elementary school.
Speaker 2: I went to Pearson Elementary School [W.G. Pearson Elementary School, Durham, North Carolina] from the beginning, from--up until fourth grade. And then we moved and I went to Burton School [Burton Elementary School, Durham, North Carolina] for fifth and sixth grade.
Speaker 1: What school?
Speaker 2: Burton, B-U-R-T-O-N Elementary.
Speaker 1: Tell me your favorite memory from school.
Speaker 2: Well, I always had good girlfriends. We'd study together.
Speaker 1: Who were some of your friends?
Speaker 2: Sylvia Jones [ph.] was one of my best friends. Sylvia Sloan [Sylvia Sloan Black] who is a cousin as well. Those were probably best friends. We had in high school, you know a nice group of kids that we would always do things together with.
Speaker 1: What'd you do together?
Speaker 2: We were in Jack and Jill [Jack and Jill of America, Inc.], we were, you know, doing volunteer work. I remember Cheryl Lucas, who was the principal's daughter, was a good friend. And you know we were on the yearbook staff. We were in the honor society. We, you know, we sort of had nice--it was academic and social. You know we all--we were all expected to do well, to be able to go to college. And so we, we worked hard, but we found time to have fun too. House parties, mostly. There weren't clubs. There weren't places like that to go like you know now.
Speaker 1: Describe your Jack and Jill chapter. The kinds of activities you were engaged in.
Speaker 2: We did a lot of volunteer work. We did--I, I actually was a candy striper at the hospital.
Speaker 1: At Lincoln [Lincoln Hospital, Durham, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: At Lincoln. We did things like cook for people, do bake sale things.
Speaker 1: Were you doing service projects?
Speaker 2: Service.
Speaker 1: In poorer neighborhoods?
Speaker 2: It would be at connecting places, like at the, at the schools. We would go to the school and read to children. Or at the library. Or very--not in neighborhoods, per se.
Speaker 1: Was colorism an issue? Like skin versus dark skin blacks?
Speaker 2: It probably was. But since I was light skinned, I didn't know, I didn't feel it like I've heard people felt it. And it was--it's a shame. I never felt that I was belittling anyone, but I think--I'm sure it happened, that people felt that way.
Speaker 1: Who was your favorite teacher?
Speaker 2: My favorite teacher in high school was Mrs. Schooler [Frances Williams Schooler]. And she was--I used to call her my play mama. She was the counselor, actually at school.
Speaker 1: At which school was this?
Speaker 2: At Hillside [Hillside High School, Durham, North Carolina]. I went to Hillside. And--
Speaker 1: What's your favorite memory of Mrs. Schooler?
Speaker 2: I don't know, she was just always there for me. I could always talk with her about things that were going on; even selections for classes, for college prep courses. And she would always, you know, catch me if I was doing something that wasn't right, in talking in the halls or skipping class or doing things like that. I remember we, we all got--my husband [James Welch] laughs at this. He says is that all you did bad? But in high school, there was a group of us who skipped out one day. We got--my friend had a station wagon and he took us to Hardee's in the middle of the day, and of course we weren't supposed to leave campus. Well--
Speaker 1: This was a restaurant?
Speaker 2: It was like a Burger King, early, you know, kind of place. And we just went to have burgers in the middle of the day and we were seniors. And, you know, we were feeling our oats and felt like wanted to go do something. And we got there and the guy, Mr. Paige [ph.], who taught driver's ed [driver's education], was there too, and we knew we were caught (laughter). They--and one of the people with us was actually Cheryl Lucas, who was the principal's daughter. And of course she got in double trouble. But we got back to campus and they were waiting for us. And they told us that we may not be able to march at graduation. But somehow things got changed and we ended up having to clean up school. We had to be the jani- help the janitors in the evening and stay late for a couple of weeks or something and that was our punishment.
Speaker 1: What kind of school was Hillside? Public or private?
Speaker 2: It was public; it still is. It's still a high school here in Durham [North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Who was the principal when you were there?
Speaker 2: John Lucas [John Lucas, Sr.].
Story_ID: 632922
Speaker 1: Do you remember any sort of unrest in Durham [North Carolina] at that time? Racial unrest.
Speaker 2: Well yeah, excuse me. When I was, you know Floyd McKissick. You've heard that name? Floyd McKissick was active in SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee], SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference]. He was one of the early sort of radical organizations protesting civil rights issues. And of course the schools were segregated up until I was in the ninth grade. So these elementary schools and Whitted Junior High School [J.A. Whitted Junior High School, Durham, North Carolina] and Hillside High School [Durham, North Carolina] were all black. There was--Floyd McKissick and his wife [Evelyn Williams McKissick] decided that they wanted their children to integrate Durham High School [Durham, North Carolina], which was the white high school on the other side of town. And they had two daughters, one older than me and then Andree was my age. And I remember very vividly Andree's not wanting to go and crying and we were in the, we were ninth grade in junior high was like seniors, you know. We were the--had been there seventh, eighth and ninth grade, and it was our ninth grade year and she had to go to Durham High the next year instead of coming with us to Hillside.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Andree, Andree McKissick [Andree McKissick Julian]. And so that was, you know for us, she was a member of our little Jack and Jill [Jack and Jill of America, Inc.] group and Mrs. McKissick was one of the coordinators of the Jack and Jills. And that they were having their kids go to the white school was scary. And they did get, you know, rocks thrown at them and get treated really bad in the years that they went. Had to have escorts into school. It was, it wasn't as bad as what we saw on the news in Little Rock, but it was to us very similar. In Little Rock, Arkansas with the integration.
Speaker 1: Was this covered in the local newspaper (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was covered in the local papers, yeah.
Speaker 1: Were they the only kids at Durham High School?
Speaker 2: I think it was a group of them that went together. Joycelyn [Joycelyn McKissick Myers] was her older sister. And she would have probably been in June--in eleventh grade and Andree would have gone in the ninth grade. And I believe there may have been more than just them. Just a small group of them.
Story_ID: 632923
Speaker 1: Do you remember any other upheavals when it came to race relations in Durham [North Carolina] in the 1950s?
Speaker 2: In Durham, the other stories that I know. You asked me do I remember. I remember from stories, that's what I do. I know that even from way back when there were some business relationships that were positive. Aaron, Aaron Moore [Aaron McDuffie Moore] and John Merrick were able to connect with the white businessmen in Durham, especially those who came to John Merrick's barbershop. The Duke brothers, Benjamin Duke [Benjamin Newton Duke] and his brother [James Buchanan Duke] would come and have their hair cut, or have John Merrick actually went to their house and cut hair once they became successful and had a house big enough. And I believe right now there's a barber chair in their home, in the Duke home that Mary Duke [Mary Duke Semans] who I know well, has taken my mom [Lyda Merrick Watts] up to see. This is the chair that your grandfather, your, your--my mother's grandfather used to cut her grandfather's hair. So he was also very--he wasn't what I would call suspected to be a Klansman [Ku Klux Klan, KKK] (laughter), whereas there were others who were. You didn't really know, but the Dukes were helpful to the black community. When the, the first Lincoln Hospital [Durham, North Carolina] burned down, it was in a clapboard house. The--there was a rumor that the Dukes were thinking about erecting a monument to the slaves who had helped to build the textile mills and the tobacco factory, you know, work in the tobacco farms. And Aaron Moore went to him and said instead of building a monument, would you help us with the next hospital? And they did help. And len- and give some funding for the Lincoln Hospital that was built that my dad [Charles DeWitt Watts] practiced in. So those relationships, there were some, some positive bridges to those relationships. I don't know if it's because sort of we had our side of town and we stayed on our side of town; we didn't bother that side of town and it was like two societies sort of operating parallel. But when the twain did need to meet, could meet to help, there was some help. I didn't, I don't remember stories of you know, Klansmen riding around pulling people and lynchings and that kind of thing, I don't remember having heard those in Durham.
Story_ID: 632924
Speaker 1: Do you have any fond memories of North Carolina Mutual [North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company, Durham, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do, of coming up to the, to the mutual for events, for Founder's Day, for programming to, you know I remember coming to my dad [Charles DeWitt Watts], my dad at one point was also medical director of North Carolina Mutual. And coming up to his office here was, was interesting. I mean the mutual also served as a place to economically uplift the African American community and you know him being medical director, they always had a medical director. The one who preceded him was Dr. Clyde Donnell who had training from Harvard [Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts] as well. And he married one of John Merrick's, John Merrick's youngest daughter, Martha [Martha Merrick Donnell], that we called Pardy [ph.] was his wife. And Uncle Clyde you know, impacted the health of families. I mean the, the mutual also had programming that talked about the harmful things in the life of people, the smoking they talked about. They talked about getting shots, babies getting shots and baby prenatal exams and you know, prevention programming. It was economically good for the company if people lived a long time, those who had policies, especially right. So it wasn't self-serving always, but for the employees. Probably some of the first employee health programs were here. They always had a physician on staff.
Story_ID: 632925
Speaker 1: What's your favorite visual memory of your grandparents?
Speaker 2: Which grandparents (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Either side, both sides.
Speaker 2: Well I can tell you that my grandparent--my grandmothers. I've told you stories about my mother's parents who I lived with growing up, Ed [Edward Merrick] and, and Lyda [Lyda Moore Merrick]. But later my mother [Lyda Merrick Watts] essentially took care of both of my grandmothers. They both came to live with us in our house on Lawson Street at sort of the end of their, their lives. So my grandmother, Grandma Watts we called her, Ida Hawes Watts who was from Atlanta [Georgia], would come here to Durham [North Carolina] during the winter because our house was warmer. Daddy [Charles DeWitt Watts] was able to afford a house that was a little warmer than Uncle Albert [Albert Hawes Watts]. And so the house in Atlanta--and she liked being in Atlanta for church connections and all that, but she had arthritis. And her knees would ache if she was cold. And his house wasn't brick and it wasn't centrally heated. So she would spend her winters with us for many years until it got to the point where she really shouldn't travel. So she was still living at our house when my youngest child [Sule Welch] was born in 1972. I have pictures of her with him as a baby. And then maybe--so she was there during my pre- during my puberty years, my hormone years, my boyfriend/girlfriend years, you know.
Speaker 1: What's your favorite memory of her?
Speaker 2: I remember she sat in the kitchen often after dinner. And she would sit longer because getting up and down was painful for her. And I was doing the dishes. And she and I would talk. And she would talk about her sisters and growing up in Macon [Georgia] and you know that would be our time together in a way.
Speaker 1: Did all of the women in your house ever cook together, or sew together?
Speaker 2: We all did it, but I can't think of it like a, you know like a sewing circle or like a cooking--I guess at holidays for Christmas or Thanksgiving time, we would all be in the kitchen together. Often people were bringing things that were already cooked and just, you know, unwrapping them or warming them up or whatever. The kitchen wasn't that big, wasn't big enough for everybody to be in there cooking.
Speaker 1: What year did you graduate Hillside [Hillside High School, Durham, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: I finished Hillside in '64 [1964], right. So I was gonna say about three years after my grandmother, my Grandma Watts passed away, Lybo became--got to a point in her health where she needed to not be alone. And she had been alone in a house. My grandfather had died, Ed had died when I was a junior in college [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia]. So then Lybo came down and she was living at my mom's house. Now I wasn't there then, I was married and having kids and living in Reston, Virginia by then. But she was always, you know, there when we came to visit.
Story_ID: 632926
Speaker 1: You graduated with honors.
Speaker 2: Sort of (laughter). I graduated.
Speaker 1: You did, but you did okay.
Speaker 2: I did okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And how did you end up at Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Well, we used to visit Atlanta [Georgia] to visit Uncle Albert [Albert Hawes Watts] and Grandma Watts [Ida Hawes Watts] when they--when she was down there. And I had heard about Spelman and I just decided that's where I wanted to apply. I don't think I applied anywhere else. I thought about Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] because daddy [Charles DeWitt Watts] always was talking about Howard, but I don't think my mom [Lyda Merrick Watts] wanted me to go to Howard. So I don't think I ended up going, even applying to Howard. I just applied to Spelman.
Speaker 1: What was your first visual image?
Speaker 2: Let me, let me talk a little bit more about that. I wanted to say that I--in my high school class [at Hillside High School, Durham, North Carolina], my high school class was the very first class that some of the kids did not go to just African American--just HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities]. There were three or four people who came out of my class and actually went to Duke [Duke University, Durham, North Carolina]. So Duke might have been an option, but I really didn't consider it as being local (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do you remember who went to Duke?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Connie Jackson [Constance Jackson Carter] who is Maynard Jackson's sisters, her--one of his younger sisters, finished high school with me and went to Duke. And Ellis Jones [Ellis Jones, III], those two went out of my class.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Did you know Maynard Jackson?
Speaker 1: Yes, I knew Maynard.
Speaker 2: What are your memories of Maynard Jackson?
Speaker 1: Maynard was fabulous. I mean yeah he was, he was an excellent politician and speaker and did wonders for Atlanta, definitely, yeah.
Speaker 2: Was he here when you were here?
Speaker 1: No, his mother [Irene Dobbs Jackson] was here. His mother came here, she had, she had maybe five children, Maynard and Carol Ann [Carol Ann Jackson Miller], maybe four, what I can remember. And then Paul [Paul Jackson] and Connie. And Paul was younger than Connie. So Carol Ann and Maynard were the two older ones. So he was not at home anymore when she came here and she was professor at NCCU [North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina], which was the reason she came and brought them with her and they came and finished school. They didn't, you know they just came for a few years. They hadn't lived here a long time.
Story_ID: 632927
Speaker 1: What do you remember about Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Oh, I just remember just thoroughly enjoying being there. Spelman was a place where I could blossom and be myself. I majored in elementary ed [elementary education] and psychology. And enjoyed classes and people and you know it was--
Speaker 1: Tell me your favorite memory from freshman year.
Speaker 2: Well freshman year I was in Packard Hall; that was my dormitory. And I remember Mrs. Tumor [ph.] I think was my English teacher. And I was in the glee club, and I was also in the Granddaughters Club. And you know I was taking the basic courses to start with. But it was, it was my first year being away from home and trying to figure all that out and just meeting a lot of people, friends and getting to know my way around campus. I actually had been a swimming instructor, before I was a lifeguard and swimming instructor. And I, I actually got a little job up at, at the gym, instruct--being a swimming instructor. You know everybody that finished Spelman in my era had to pass swimming. And so I was like--I could--they need students to help teach the classes. My roommate will tell you stories now about me making her swim across that pool to take her swimming test.
Speaker 1: Was hair an issue for women at Spelman if they had to take swimming?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's why so many of 'em came not knowing how to swim, 'cause it was an issue. And you know it was just required, you know it was a part of it. You had to pass swimming. It was safety they thought I think, that women should at least learn how to tread water and be able to swim across the pool.
Speaker 1: How did women--what was hair like at Spelman at that time? Were there hair salons surrounding the school or were, were Spelman students doing other students' hair?
Speaker 2: We were doing our--we were doing each other's hair.
Speaker 1: Was it pressing, relaxers?
Speaker 2: Probably pressing, pressing. I mean I was lucky I didn't have to do that. But I tried it. I think I did get somebody to try 'cause it was so frizzy. Atlanta [Georgia] was so humid. And so swimming, I was wearing, I would sleep at night in--with a hair dryer with the, the plastic hood and the, the coiled air thing. And I had rollers that were the size of orange juice, frozen orange juice cans that I would sleep on every night because I was swimming every day. And my hair really looked great because I was doing that every day. But if you didn't do it every day, it was (laughter)--
Speaker 1: My roommate did that every day too, that's funny.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. And actually you know it was a girls school. So often you could tell if somebody had classes over on Morehouse's campus [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] or had something to do off campus. On campus, we would kind of let down, you know, you wouldn't put on makeup and you wouldn't worry about your hair too much if you didn't have to go off campus.
Speaker 1: What's your favorite memory from Sisters Chapel [Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: I just enjoy--I just get inspired, I still get inspired in that chapel. I actually went down Founder's Day this year. And I found, you know I, I just get what they call duck bumps, goose bumps. I mean the choral readings of the girls, the, the history, the inspirational speakers.
Speaker 1: Do you remember one of those speakers when you were at Spelman?
Speaker 2: I wish I could. I remember, I can't call her name. But this woman was one of the first in a president's cabinet I believe. She was a black woman who I--attorney general or something. She was, she was--anyway, they brought speakers of that ilk, but I can't call the name of 'em. I can see her, but I can't call her name.
Speaker 1: What was so great about her speech?
Speaker 2: Well that, that she was, was actually in the national government and could talk from firsthand knowledge of what went on on a national level in this country.
Speaker 1: Who was the president of Spelman when you were there?
Speaker 2: Albert Manley [Albert E. Manley] was the president when I was there.
Speaker 1: Do you remember seeing him around campus?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was around campus a lot.
Speaker 1: What was the message to Spelman women at that time?
Speaker 2: I think the message was to do your absolute best to make a difference in this world. At least that was the message I got, was you know, you can be whatever you want to be and make your choices and do, do something to make a difference in this world.
Speaker 1: Were you a part of any clubs or sororities?
Speaker 2: No, we didn't have sororities on campus when I was there. It was not allowed. If you wanted to be in a sorority, you could pledge over on Clark's campus [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia]. And some girls did who really, really wanted it that bad. But the feeling was that we were a sisterhood and they didn't want to split up the sisterhood with all the other sororities. I know they have them now.
Story_ID: 632928
Speaker 1: What was your impression of Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] men?
Speaker 2: Oh, I loved 'em (laughter). No. Actually my husband [James Welch] is a Morehouse man, my dad [Charles DeWitt Watts] was a Morehouse man, you know, my two sons [Babu Welch and Sule Welch] are Morehouse men. So Morehouse was okay. We would go to, you know Benny Mays [Benjamin Mays] was still there when I was there. I loved to hear him talk, his speeches. And we would go over to campus to, to different events.
Speaker 1: What's one memory you have of Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] women interacting with Morehouse men? Is there a favorite memory?
Speaker 2: We interacted a lot. I was actually Miss Junior Class (laughter).
Speaker 1: What was that pageant like?
Speaker 2: That was interesting.
Speaker 1: Did you have a talent?
Speaker 2: No, you didn't have to have a talent. I don't really know how I got picked. I actually made my own dress. It was more of a social pick, it really wasn't an interview audition type thing (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did they have a coronation?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they did. It was for the Miss Maroon and White and I was just like in the court, basically. Got to ride in the parade and I remember making my suit and making the two other people's suits, you know, to ride on the back of the car. And then I made the dress that I wore that night. So special feelings of, you know, that. And of course they had fraternities on Morehouse's campus, and the fraternities would have somebody from Spelman be, you know, Miss Alpha [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity] or Miss Que [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity] or whatever. But--
Speaker 1: Who were the student leaders on campus at that time, at Spelman and Morehouse?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't even know.
Story_ID: 632929
Speaker 1: You, you mentioned the activism at that time. You were at Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] from what year to what year?
Speaker 2: Sixty-four [1964] to '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: And what do you recall about civil rights activism (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know, that's when more- a lot of it was still going on, but not on our campuses. 'Course I remember seeing Malcolm X come to Atlanta [Georgia] and go and hear him speak.
Speaker 1: What do you recall about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was wild, it was scary, you know. He was--
Speaker 1: Tell me, tell me what you saw.
Speaker 2: Well, it was, it was high security. There were a lot of people around. I believe they were the mus- the people who secured him, not city.
Speaker 1: Fruit of Islam.
Speaker 2: Yeah, from Islam. And he was you know just very radical, more radical than I was in his, his thinking. And later having followed up and read some, I understand where he was coming from and I don't think he was necessarily wrong. But at that point it was new, it was new information for me. And I wasn't ready to get on the bandwagon with him. But I thought he needed to speak; he needed to be heard.
Speaker 1: What else was scary? So you saw his security. How were the students responding?
Speaker 2: The--you know some of the students were very black power, it was, you know that kind of sort of feeling around. When I finished, the year that I finished, there was more of the Afro wearing. And I remember afterwards looking and meeting people and not really knowing who they were 'cause now they had these Afros.
Speaker 1: So while you were there, Afros weren't big (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It wasn't, it was like the very beginning of it. But they were--it was beginning to catch on. Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture], all of that. Actually Ali [Muhammad Ali] came to campus, you know, at one point. He was down on the, on the corner. They wouldn't let him come up to campus to speak. He was down by the drugstore and everybody ran down there to see him. That was just before one of his fights.
Story_ID: 632930
Speaker 1: What were the cliques at Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] at that time? Were there the smart girls and the pretty girls, light-skinned, dark-skinned, rich, poor (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't remember that part. It didn't seem like that to me; I didn't get that. It was, it was more your dormitory, people in the same dorm kind of got to know each other better. Or if you were in the same major and you were taking classes together. It, it had to do with that more than--I didn't get the, the other clique-y kinds of things going on. I was in Manley Hall [Dorothy Shepard Manley Hall] my senior year and I was in Abby [Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Hall] for sophomore year. And you know--
Speaker 1: Take me around campus. What, what is your favorite aspect of the campus? Describe it.
Speaker 2: Sisters Chapel [Atlanta, Georgia] is. And you know that's sort of the--now it's the focal point. I'm so glad they renovated it.
Speaker 1: Were there any rituals you can remember from freshmen week or on graduation?
Speaker 2: Well it--you know you had to go to chapel. You had to wear your--we didn't have to wear white gloves, that was right af- we were right after the group that had to do the white gloves and stuff.
Speaker 1: Did you have curfew?
Speaker 2: Yeah we had curfew.
Speaker 1: How did that work?
Speaker 2: On Sundays I think the guys had to be off campus by six [o'clock]. And I think we had to be back if we went off campus by ten or eleven, something like that.
Story_ID: 632931
Speaker 1: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And you graduated Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] in what year?
Speaker 1: Sixty-eight [1968].
Speaker 2: Did you do well academically?
Speaker 1: I did okay.
Speaker 2: And where did you go from Spelman?
Speaker 1: I got married (laughter).
Speaker 2: Where did you meet your husband?
Speaker 1: No, actually what I--we got married the month after I graduated. He was Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], he had graduated the year ahead of me.
Speaker 2: How did you meet?
Speaker 1: That's an interesting story, he picked me out (laughter). We met swimming. He was on the light- he was on the swim team at Morehouse and he would come over to the--I was on the water ballet team for Spelman. We didn't have racing swim team. And actually he was the first Morehouse man who decide--who agreed to be a partner in the water ballet. The next year they all were there, the next time we did it, we had lots of partners. But we did a solo water ballet thing together.
Speaker 2: Tell me your husband's name.
Speaker 1: Jim, James Welch, yeah. But he also--he was from Nashville, Tennessee. And he finished, like I said, the year ahead of me, so we got married the year I finished (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Where did you get married?
Speaker 1: Here in--we got married at St. Joseph's Church [St. Joseph African Methodist Episcopal Church] here in Durham [North Carolina].
Speaker 2: Was it a big wedding?
Speaker 1: The church I grew up in. Yeah, it was a nice wedding, it was a very big wedding. It was my mother [Lyda Merrick Watts] and father's [Charles DeWitt Watts] wedding (laughter).
Speaker 2: Do you remember who attended? Anyone that we might know?
Speaker 1: Probably not, I don't know. It was big.
Speaker 2: (LYDA MERRICK WATTS): (Unclear) in Durham.
Speaker 1: I was standing in the reception line, saying, "Okay Mom, who's coming now?"
Speaker 2: Okay. And when did you have your children?
Speaker 1: My oldest son [Babu Welch] was born in 1970. I actually taught school after we got married, I was--told you, elementary ed [elementary education]. So I taught a year in Atlanta [Georgia], and then my husband was drafted. And luckily did not go to Vietnam, ended up being stationed at the Pentagon in Washington [D.C.] at Fort Myer [Virginia]. So I finished out teaching a year in Atlanta and then I came up to--that's how we got into the Washington, D.C. area. We lived in Arlington [Virginia] near Fort Myer for a year. And at that--in that year I conceived our first child, and he was born in November of '70 [1970].
Story_ID: 632932
Speaker 1: What year did you move to Arlington [Virginia]?
Speaker 2: In '69 [1969], yeah, the summer (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do you remember any of the protests of that era? The anti-Vietnam War protests?
Speaker 2: I read about 'em. I prob- I didn't do 'em, yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the--well you mentioned the Black Power movement, the Black Arts Movement. Do you remember any of that?
Speaker 2: No, not as specifically, no.
Speaker 1: And where did you teach?
Speaker 2: I taught at a--the first school I taught at, it was--they integrated the Atlanta Public Schools by putting the new black teachers in the white schools and the new white teachers went into the black schools. So I went into a school that was out near Lenox Square [Atlanta, Georgia]. I think the name of it was Tuckahoe Stewart [sic.]. And I was the only black teacher there. And there was one black child, and he wasn't in my class (laughter).
Speaker 1: What was that like?
Speaker 2: And that was very different for me coming from all of the segregation, everything I had done was totally black, including college. I think at Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] they had had some exchange students from some of the Ivy League schools come through. But that was the closest I had gotten, even in college, to having any white friends.
Speaker 1: How did the other teachers receive you?
Speaker 2: Well, what they did was they had a mentor teacher assigned to three new teachers, and that was brilliant. And this teacher had an aide with her. And so she was white, the aide was black. And she circulated to me and to two other schools where the other two teachers were. But she would help us through. I mean it was great; we had the aide, made our bulletin boards, you know, that kind of thing. But she would also help us through any issues that we had with family, families of the students or any concerns about our relationships with other teachers. But I don't remember any problems.
Speaker 1: Who were your friends at that school? Did you make any friends in faculty?
Speaker 2: Yes. In fact I have a scrapbook at home of--that they gave me because I resigned at the end of the year to come up to, to join my husband [James Welch]. And they had this, I have this scrapbook I kept with all the kids and the, the teachers who were my friends and pictures of us and the going away party and that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Okay, so no real racial tensions there.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: What about the black student, any stories about he or she did?
Speaker 2: No, he did okay. I mean he was treated--there weren't any riots, there weren't any problems. It was calm.
Speaker 1: And were you hearing stories at this time about the integration of schools in Durham?
Speaker 2: Yes. I remember hearing about them and it was, it had to do with--in fact I knew my, my brother [Charles DeWitt Watts, Jr.] and sister [Winifred Watts Hemphill] were here. My brother's ten years younger than me and my sister's fourteen years younger. So they were involved in that until actually at high school level my parents [Lyda Merrick Watts and Charles DeWitt Watts] sent both of them away to prep school because the quality of education they were getting in the, in integrated schools weren't nearly--wasn't nearly as good as when they were segregated.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: Well, in the segregated setting for me and my other sister [Deborah Watts Hill], the teachers were much higher caliber. They were some Ph.D.'s were teaching our schools because the Ph.D. black teachers couldn't--you know there were limited opportunities in--for them. As things opened up, those kind--people with those credits or that, those credentials, could go to other colleges, white colleges and they weren't interested in teaching in public schools any longer. So you also found some of the separation of mixing the teacher pool, there wasn't the camaraderie between teachers. So continuity was lost, and you know we couldn't get away with much in our school. Those teachers knew us, they knew our parents, they knew all of us, not just me just because of the status of my family. But they knew all of us from church relationships because we were such a closed community. The kids couldn't get away with much. It was--they were encouraged all to study and learn and, and we had student teachers that came in from NCCU [North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina]. I, I know that the academic quality was a whole lot better then. So my sister, my baby sister went to Madeira [Madeira School, McLean, Virginia] for high school and my brother went to Deerfield [Deerfield Academy, Deerfield, Massachusetts] for high school. I think they both went more like their tenth, eleventh, twelfth, not their ninth grade year.
Story_ID: 632933
Speaker 1: So tell me about your children. Give me their names and when they were born.
Speaker 2: Okay my young, my oldest one is Babu, B-A-B-U, Guai, G-U-A-I Welch [Babu Welch], M.D. He was born in November, 1970, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And where was he educated?
Speaker 2: He was educated at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] undergrad and at Howard medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.]. Finished Howard residence at GW [George Washington University, Washington, D.C.], and he's a neurosurgeon, and he practices in Dallas, Texas now. My younger son is Sule, S-U-L-E, Konata, K-O-N-A-T-A, Welch [Sule Welch]. And he was born in 1972, February. And he lives in Atlanta [Georgia]. He was educated at Morehouse undergrad and he has his M.B.A. from Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: And what does he do now?
Speaker 2: He's an entrepreneur. He actually does some training in human resource training, as well as martial arts fitness training.
Speaker 1: Okay. Two, two sons?
Speaker 2: Two sons. That's it.
Speaker 1: And take me through--then your sojourn from Arlington [Virginia] with your husband [James Welch]. What did you do while you were there?
Speaker 2: Well when I was in Arlington I did, I, I--when I first got there I thought okay, now I'm gonna find something other than teaching to do. And I--that summer worked with Blue Cross Blue Shield [Blue Cross Blue Shield Association] in claims management, but to sort of make sure I had another option, I didn't give up my teaching credentials. And decided okay I'd go back in September. So that September I taught in Arlington Public Schools, and I taught for a year there. And I always taught third grade, I even did student teaching in third grade and I like third graders. They're cute and they don't talk back yet. They're too young to talk back (laughter). They still like their parents and their teachers.
Speaker 1: How was, how were relations in Arlington at that time?
Speaker 2: They were okay. I mean we were, we were living off base, so we were living in a, a one bedroom rented, furnished one bedroom apartment where military privates' wives lived. And it was a mixed neighborhood. I mean you know it was, it was fine. We had friends, interracial friends, his friends from the base and their families. But we never did live on base, and he never did do any of the traveling with the [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 1: Any specific stories from that era?
Speaker 2: It's just that, you know, I was focusing on trying to lose weight (laughter) and trying to--
Speaker 1: From pregnancy.
Speaker 2: And working on pregnancy and no I can't think of anything really specific. It was, it was sort of figuring out about living together as a fam- as a couple again because we really had only lived together as a couple for two months after marriage before he was in basic training and then transferred up here. So there was a lot of letter writing and that kind of thing, but you know, saw each other at his breaks. But it was getting to know each other again as a couple.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any dinners together? You know, spent rekindling.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes, but I don't wanna talk about all that.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 632934
Speaker 1: Did you teach for a while or what'd you do next?
Speaker 2: Well I taught for that year and then, then I was pregnant and I decided to take a leave, and I didn't go back into teaching at all. We moved into Reston.
Speaker 1: Virginia.
Speaker 2: Yeah, into Reston, Virginia in that summer after I--after the school year ended. Basically because I was looking for a apartment that had a washer and dryer in it because I was gonna have this new baby [Sule Welch] and we didn't have disposable diapers then. And I wanted to not have to go to a laundromat. So I was adamant about trying to find somewhere to live that would have a washer and dryer in it. And Reston had this new set of apartments and people might say you moved to Reston because it was a planned community and all of that reasons that some people moved there. Well I moved there because I found the washer and dryer in the apartment. And it turned out to be a very, a good move for us. 'Course he [Welch's husband, James Welch] was still commuting then, he was commuting. We had one car. So often I was left without or we had to share, you know one, one day I'd have it and he'd have it. But they did have commuter bus system from the town to go into the city, so he could use that. And in Reston actually there was a, a fair number of African American families there then. And we--there was one woman, her name is Marian Secundy [Marian Gray Secundy], who you may have interviewed her brother Bill Gray [HistoryMaker William H. Gray, III]. But Marian was sort of like the mother of all the African American families in Reston. She was there. She would meet you and she would invite you over. She'd see you in the grocery store and say, "Oh, you're new to town, come over." Go over to her house, have coffee or whatever. And she started to gather people together and then we formed an organization called Reston Black Focus. And for years every Labor Day weekend we would have this Black Focus Festival [Black Focus Arts Festival] in Reston and we would bring the African drummers from Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] and we'd have a speaker and we would have African folktale reading. And we would have all of this out on the plaza down in Reston. It became a, a real place to be for Labor Day, Labor Day I think.
Speaker 1: Did white residents ever attend?
Speaker 2: They came and they enjoyed it. It was--Reston's--a lot of the white residents were very international. They came--they had traveled. They may have been with the [U.S.] Foreign Service in the government or have other reasons to have traveled a lot. And many I found had collected African art or you know were interested in--and it was the six--it was after the '60s [1960s] and they kind of had understanding of something about black power and you know, integration.
Story_ID: 632935
Speaker 1: What we found, and this is, this is interesting. What we found in Fairfax County [Virginia] was very different. This, Reston's [Reston, Virginia] sort of interracial, interconnections was one thing, but some of the families were--had older kids. Kids who were high school, some of these black families who I met. And I'm the, I'm the baby of the group. I'm having babies, I'm pregnant, and they have kids who were, you know, high school or junior high school age. And they're trying to enroll them, they have enrolled them in the Fairfax County school system [Fairfax County Public Schools], which we found out still celebrated Slave Day. And this was in 1972, '73 [1973], '75 [1975] maybe. And so the guys got together, you know, many of the, the black men were commuting downtown for either government jobs or other jobs. They were working in the city and commuting. And so they stayed home and went down en masse one day to the superintendent's office to let him know that you know, this isn't the thing to do. I mean they were having the high school kids pretend to be slaves and the, the white kids were pretending to be masters, and they were having an auction, a mock auction. And you know we only found out about this 'cause somebody's child came home and told their mom, "We're having Slave Day tomorrow," and they were excited. And so--
Speaker 2: What was the point? Was this supposed to be educational?
Speaker 1: It was history, yeah, so it stopped. But what I understood after getting more involved in Reston is, or in Fairfax County, is that when Durham [North Carolina] had high schools that were segregated, Fairfax didn't have high schools for blacks, period. If you were black and you wanted to go to high school in the '60s [1960s] in Fairfax County, your parents had to know somebody or move to D.C. [Washington, D.C.] or to Loudoun County [Virginia]. Their children normally didn't go past like seventh or eighth grade. Consequently, what you had was you had a lot of African American tradesmen. They were trained as electricians, carpenters, brick masons, you know, and they made good livings doing that, but they weren't college bound and they weren't, you know, they didn't have high school education. So they maybe have gone--figured out how to bookkeep and how to do--and there were a lot of family, you know, sort of apprenticeships in businesses being sons learning from fathers. Because I, I, I joined a church there, and that's what I found in the families in the church.
Speaker 2: What church?
Speaker 1: I can't remember the name of the church. It was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Was it a black church, white church?
Speaker 1: It was a black church, yeah.
Speaker 2: A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal]?
Speaker 1: I think it was a Baptist, it was black Baptist and it was in, it was right in Arlington [Virginia], yeah.
Speaker 2: How long did you live in northern Virginia?
Speaker 1: I lived in northern Virginia for thirty years. We moved there in 1970 and we left in '96 [1996] when we came to Durham.
Story_ID: 632936
Speaker 1: Now you also received a master's degree.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell me about that.
Speaker 2: Well I, I worked at Inova Health System [Falls Church, Virginia]. I did a lot of things before I went to Inova Health System, though. I actually--we owned bookstores. There was no bookstore in Reston [Virginia]. We partnered with some neighbors in a townhouse community and opened up a bookstore and ended up being the owners of the bookstore, ultimately.
Speaker 1: What type of bookstore?
Speaker 2: It was a general bookstore that competed against the bookstore at Tysons Corner [Virginia]. We actually did better than they did at first. But I--from that I got even more into the community and I was a member of the Durham--the Reston Board of Commerce [Greater Reston Chamber of Commerce]. Actually was the president of that at one point. I was the president of a merchant's association. So I really, really got involved in the community. And then as Reston grew, we had a lot of other businesses coming, Nortel [Nortel Networks Corporation] and IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] and all of them brought installations out there, government contracting, segments of large corporations, Sprint [Sprint Corporation], all were building buildings out there. And so I became, you know, got to network with a lot of those businesses that were building out there. And--
Speaker 1: Do you have any memories from, from those days?
Speaker 2: Yeah. I mean I was on the board of trade, the board of commerce they called it. And you know we were--lots of conversations about how we interfaced with the government of Fairfax County [Virginia]. How these new businesses came in and got permits and were able to get credits for, for improving traffic patterns or you know, adding to the zoning, getting zoning issues straightened out and that. And so I was involved in a, in a lot of that.
Speaker 1: What was roughly the percentage of blacks in Reston at that time?
Speaker 2: Probably about 1 or 2 percent.
Speaker 1: Very small. But you were well received (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Very small. We were, yeah. Reston Black Focus sort of went away because women started going to work. I mean after the kids were out, the women started going to work and not having time to run this volunteer organization anymore. So we couldn't pay attention to that anymore, but we did stay friends and continued to network with each other.
Speaker 1: What was your husband [James Welch] doing?
Speaker 2: My husband was commuting back and forth to D.C. [Washington, D.C.]. At one point he worked for ISE organization [International Securities Exchange Holdings, Inc.], which contracted with the government and he actually installed computer systems in a lot of black colleges, HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities] with Title III money.
Speaker 1: Were your kids involved in Jack and Jill [Jack and Jill of America, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: We joined Jack and Jill when they were in high school. I didn't join it until then for them.
Speaker 1: And do you remember any of the activities?
Speaker 2: Yeah. But they were just, you know, they did some volunteer work. They, they met, they--the, the benefit for them was that they did get to meet other black kids. The high schools, there were very few blacks in those high schools. So--in fact my younger son's [Sule Welch] roommate at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] was his friend he met because of Jack and Jill in Reston. My older son [Babu Welch] didn't exactly need it, but the younger son needed it and enjoyed it more.
Speaker 1: And when did you enter George Mason [George Mason University, Fairfax, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: I went to George Mason while I was working full time after the kids went to college, at Inova and I took the M.B.A. part--it was an executive M.B.A. program. So I did it on weekends (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And George Mason was growing at that time.
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah it was. My classes were out at ITC Building near Dulles [Virginia]. And we met all day Saturday or all day Sunday on alternating weeks, yeah.
Speaker 1: And so you got your M.B.A. from George Mason.
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: And at this time you were also working at Inova?
Speaker 2: Yes. I was working full time. I was manager of community relations, and then I moved into being a director of development for them, for both Fairfax Hospital [Inova Fairfax Hospital, Falls Church, Virginia] and Fair Oaks Hospital [Inova Fair Oaks Hospital, Fairfax, Virginia].
Speaker 1: So that was probably a rare, a rare thing for an African American woman.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: In that position.
Speaker 2: I would say so. My boss was Jim Scott [James M. Scott], who is a legislator in the Virginia legislature [Virginia House of Delegates], and he was vice president of public affairs. And we struck up a fabulous relationship, I love Jim. And he's also very supportive of me and of the African American community within Fairfax County. So it was a good place for me to be with him. I could help him and he could help me.

Speaker 1: When did you return to Durham [North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Duke [Duke University, Durham, North Carolina] recruited me home in 1996. They were building up staffing for a campaign, a huge development campaign and someone here said you know they're hiring development officers. Don't you wanna apply? And I said I don't know, we'll see. And I was home for Thanksgiving one year and they set up an appointment with me and this vice president for development. And it went from there. And I ended up coming here and working with the School of Nursing at Duke and actually revitalizing that school, which just was pretty--it had, they had just about closed, the School of Nursing.
Speaker 1: You had done quite a bit of fundraising.
Speaker 2: I did fundraising and it's advancement, which is more than just fundraising. It's the publicity, it's rebuilding the alumni relations. They had decided to not have an undergraduate nursing program any longer at Duke. And so all those people who had finished as undergrad nurses, weren't necessarily interested in giving back or being involved; they were angry. And we had to figure out how to overcome some of their anger, and also during the time actually reinstituted a bachelor's [degree] program, which is a second bachelor's. It's not exactly the same as they remember as coming after high school there, but it still helped them to see that Duke was educating leaders in nursing and they could be proud of it. So we built a building. We raised enough to build a nursing school building which just opened last year.
Speaker 1: Great. And what's your current title?
Speaker 2: Currently I'm still with Duke, but I'm with the Center for Child and Family Health [Durham, North Carolina], and executive director for advancement for that organization. And it works with kids who have suffered from maltreatment or trauma as a result of abuse or just being in a traumatic event like Katrina [Hurricane Katrina] or loss of parents or fires, that kind of thing, mental trauma. So I'm raising money and providing public relations and marketing assistance to them.

Speaker 1: As someone who was born and raised in Durham [North Carolina] and now you've returned in a leadership position, can you describe the transformation of this town, including Duke University [Durham, North Carolina] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, huge. When I was young, when I, when I left here to go to high--to college [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], I didn't know where Duke was in Durham. I knew it was in Durham, but I had never--I couldn't tell you how to get there. I wouldn't say I'd never been there, but I couldn't tell you how to get there because it was forbidden for me to actually drive there after I got my license to drive out of our side of town. My dad [Charles DeWitt Watts] would say you know, you're not to go after these certain streets, and I didn't. So when I came down to interview, I remember my mom [Lyda Merrick Watts] had to pull at the map and show me how to go over to interview at Duke. And the openness of the city is, is phenomenally different. I mean of course it's--there's still our side of town, which is going to always--well I don't know, but it still is. The, the sort of affluent part of our side of town was demolished when the expressway was cut through and what we call, what was Hayti [Durham, North Carolina] what, what it was called, that neighborhood was demolished. My great-grandparents' homes were all demolished. The church [St. Joseph African Methodist Episcopal Church, Durham, North Carolina] I was married in is still there. My mom actually played a huge role in getting it a part of, of the preservation, historic preservation, on their rolls so that it wasn't torn down, that building. Even though the congregation doesn't prac- doesn't worship there. They worship in a new building now. But it's, it's still a mystery to often--to whites on--to white people that I could--I didn't choose to go to Duke, or that Duke wasn't totally open to me. It was just opening doors to blacks in my college years. You know, even alumni would say to me, "Did you come to Duke?" I'm like, "No." Or when I would go out to visit alums all over the country, the nursing alums to engage them for the university and I would say, "I'll meet you in this hotel." And unless I had on a Duke button or Duke blue, they wouldn't look for me to be there, of course. So it's still you know, a, a--it's still alive and well, but not as bad economically. There's opportunity for African Americans here. Downtown Durham is being developed by a partnership where one of them is a Durham African American who was born in Durham. So I mean one of the developers; there's several. But of the one largest one, Greenfire [Greenfire Development LLC, Durham, North Carolina].
Story_ID: 632939
Speaker 1: And North Carolina Mutual [North Caroline Mutual Life Insurance Company, Durham, North Carolina] has grown quite a bit.
Speaker 2: North Carolina Mutual's grown. It's moved into this huge building in '64 [1964]. And you know it's, it's moving with the times.
Speaker 1: What would you like the legacy of your family to be, and the legacy of yourself to be?
Speaker 2: Well I'd like for people to know that my family always felt that what they were doing for the com- what was for the community. I mean it was ingrained in both Merrick's [John Merrick] and Moore's [Aaron McDuffie Moore] motivations even of finding this building and Moore's of the hospital [Lincoln Hospital, Durham, North Carolina], of the library [Durham Colored Library, Inc.; Stanford L. Warren Branch Library, Durham, North Carolina] of the other, the parts that he played in NCCU's [North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina] development. That, you know he was not doing this for his own benefit. He was doing this to benefit the community and the people he saw who needed help and his belief in humankind. And that I think our family has continued that. My dad's [Charles DeWitt Watts] work, you know, was very much humanitarian based, and he was an excellent surgeon. But he gave a lot back to the community, served on a lot of boards and also gave a lot back medically without compensation. That we as a family have looked to make Durham [North Carolina] better. And I'm very happy to be here to add to that. And what I'm doing now is making Durham better. These kids get help; it makes Durham better. They become more viable citizens than they would be if they didn't have this help. So it all comes down to everybody helping each other.

And this is Deborah Chase Watts, my sister and her daughter, Shana Blake Hill, Deborah Chase Watts Hill and Shana Blake Hill. And then--this is my bro- my son, my second son Babu Guai Welch.

Speaker 1: I already did that, a neurosurgeon. And this is my brother Charles DeWitt Watts, Jr. and his two children and his wife. This is Chaz, Charles DeWitt Watts, III, Bess Kathleen Watts [Bess Watts] and Janis Ernst [Janis Watts Ernst].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Okay, this is Ida Hawes Watts who was my father's mother. And this is my father's father. He died a lot younger as you can tell. This was probably when he was in college. And he died when my father was in college. So this is his moth- the mother Ida is probably in her late seventies on this picture. And his name is Lewis Watts [Lewis G. Watts, Sr.], and he's probably in his twenties on that picture. So that's the last picture we have of him.

Speaker 1: (LYDA MERRICK WATTS): No (laughter). No, but I just remembered that he didn't act like a teacher all the time. Just that he would tell jokes 'cause teachers always didn't tell jokes.

Speaker 1: I see. Tell me a little bit about race relations in town.
Speaker 2: (LYDA MERRICK WATTS): We didn't have any (laughter). The white folks were on one side of town and the black folks were on the other side of town. And then North Carolina Mutual [North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company, Durham, North Carolina] was an oddity. All this black business, real business, you know. You very seldom saw anybody in the, the white folks coming in. Sometimes they'd have somebody, a consultant to come in, you know. But they didn't mingle with us at all socially.

Speaker 2: (LYDA MERRICK WATTS): Oh, yeah, we cussed 'em out a bit (laughter).
Speaker 1: They were a little upset about the situation.
Speaker 2: (LYDA MERRICK WATTS): A little (laughter). You didn't let it worry you that much because that's just the way it was. You just learned to live around them, you know.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what they said about race relations?
Speaker 2: (LYDA MERRICK WATTS): Well, we didn't say anything nice about 'em. Sometimes we had to consult them because they were the people that ran the businesses we had to, had to shop in town. We didn't have any big stores and you had to shop.
Speaker 1: Were there ever any conflicts that you remember between whites and blacks?
Speaker 2: (LYDA MERRICK WATTS): Oh yeah, I can't say specifically, but we didn't get along with them. Definitely not social.
Speaker 1: This was during your childhood.

Speaker 2: What was the social life like?
Speaker 1: (LYDA MERRICK WATTS): Well we had a good time. Nothing serious, you played games, board games. There was a piano in the living room and some of 'em took music. And music teacher was fun. She would--we'd have a chorus and little trios, quartets. And they were personable. They didn't--not very stern, but saw that we did our lessons. We had fun with the music, though.
Speaker 2: What did you do with the music?
Speaker 1: (LYDA MERRICK WATTS): When I was in the chorus, and Mama [Lyda Moore Merrick] tried her hardest for me to take piano. And I can play the scales and that's about it (laughter).
