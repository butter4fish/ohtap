Story_ID: 88951
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let me ask you about your family history.  How far back can you trace your family?
Speaker 2: I only go back experientially to my grandparents' generations.  I have not done any genealogical study.
Speaker 1: Do you know of any ancestors--maybe what your ancestors were doing during--during slavery, during the reconstruction?
Speaker 2: No, I've done no investigation of that.  Although my great grandmother lived to be 102 years old and I was very close to her on my mother's [Altobelle Hampton] side, on my grandmother's [Lizzy James Hampton] side.  I have not done any historical inquiries so I have no sense.
Speaker 1: No stories passed down or anything about an ancestor that may have escaped or done something that--
Speaker 2: No, I have--we have stories passed down but they are post slavery stories and they are more stories about my mother's mother, my grandmother's brothers and those are very important 'cause it gave me a sense of the sociology of their time, particular of black men and how black men saw the world and, in a segregated society, had to negotiate.
Speaker 1: Is there anything you can tell us that you remember of those stories?
Speaker 2: Yeah, one, life was on the margins in terms of money, although they had quite a bit of land.  They had no economic wherewithal, it was not something they could easily trade-in and extended families lived on there.  It was not unusual for young girls or young women at a very early age to have a child out of wedlock and, of course, that became the common home ground for all of them to return and so there were always a lot of women around and it also suggested a history of men being away and, you know, stories of my grandmother's brothers, one was a gambler and pretty adventurous guy, you know, who loved to drink of white lightening and was a strong, strapping guy and was always in some kind of fight or another and was actually killed by one of his cousins over a 25 cents drink of liquor.  Now so that gave me an insight not only to him but I began to feel a broader sense of what some of the life of other black men were like.  Those stories also put in to context for me the kinds of experiences of riding on the backs of pulp wood trucks, you know that go 25 miles from Dunnellon, Florida to a little place called Blitchton, Florida, a little hamlet out--it's about twenty miles outside of Ocala [Florida], where my great grandmother lived and a lot of black people would--who had fairly extensive pieces of land and going through that kind of rough, you know, early in the morning was very cold on the back of a pup wood truck which was kind of dangerous, where my grandmother may have paid the driver 50 cents or 75 cents.  And when I would hear those stories and it gave me a little channel back into what maybe life had been like 25, 30, perhaps even 50 years earlier.  And as I grew older, at least from my imagination around those--that small amount of data, I began to get a sense of what life was like, and...
Speaker 1: Now did you grow up in Ocala?
Speaker 2: No, I actually only spent--as I have been told one day in the hospital in Ocala and then I was immediately taken to Dunnellon, Florida which is twenty-five miles west of that which is then about twenty-five miles from the Gulf of Mexico. To a little town called Dunnellon, Florida, which was probably a little over a thousand people with my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Now can you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: D-U-N-N-E-L-L-O-N.
Speaker 1: Dunnellon.  Okay
Speaker 2: Hmm hmmm.
Speaker 1: D-U-N-N-E-L-L-O--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: O-N--situated about twenty, twenty-five miles west of Ocala, Florida and about eighteen to twenty-five miles east of Crystal River, Florida, which is right on the Gulf of New Mexico.
Speaker 1: Okay--(simultaneous). Alright, now--
Speaker 2: Or Gulf of Mexico, rather, yeah.
Story_ID: 88952
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about your mother.  Can you give us her name and--full name and spell it for us.
Speaker 2: My mother was born Altobelle Hampton, that's A-L-T-O-B-E-L-L-E and H-A-M-P-T-O-N, one of two children, a younger brother, James Hampton, not altogether clear that they had the same father.  It would appear that they had different fathers.  I'm apparently named after my mother's father, Harry Lee Counts and--but I've not ever been able to get a clear articulation from either my uncle or my mother on what the family connections there was, whether Counts was actually married to my Christian grandmother [Lizzy James Hampton], which, you know, may have been a relationship in the earlier part of her life when she was a different caliber of individual than when I knew her and so I'm not--I'm just not sure about those family ties.  But that's sort of academic because it's actually the experiential ties to them that I guess in any case makes them family; and it's not the lineage of the name. But, my mother small statured woman, 4'9", probably seventy, eighty pounds when she was in high school, very bright.  A fair complexioned woman, very attractive woman and I can only imagine how she had to negotiate life coming up in a small segregated town where black people lived more or less on both ends of the town and white people lived in the center.  The Withlacoochee River runs right through the center of it and--(simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Withlacoochee?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Withlacoochee River.  My mother--I mean it's some interesting stories--my mother went to a high school called Hard Rock High and it's unbelievable and with, you know, stories of my uncle's girlfriends, one was called Short Wrists Lilly and actually probably had a--I don't know what the deformity would be the correct term but a short arm and a short wrist and with that kind of nickname, I mean these almost seem like fictional accounts.  The preacher of the church, two doors down from my grandmother's house, in the black community with no paved roads or electric lights and pumps and the like, his name was Reverend LaGree (ph.).  Again, one would think this was almost a short fictionalized story but it was a rich sociology, you know, where my grandmother took me to visit all of her women friends as she went to hail the sick and the shut-in and preparing food and, you know, the church gatherings and the fish fries right there on the Withlacoochee River and homemade ice creams--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--spell it.
Speaker 2: I think it's W-I-T-H-A-L-C-O-H-E-E [sic], it's probably an Indian name but I don't know of what tribal or ethnic background within the Indian American--Native American context.
Story_ID: 88953
Speaker 1: Okay.  You say your grandmother [Lizzy James Hampton] was--she was like a, an important person in the community--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, she was clearly the center.  I mean my mother [Altobelle Hampton], my mother and my father [James Tweetie Early] separated probably when I was about four, perhaps a little earlier, but I was probably about four.  So we were living in St. Augustine, Florida, the oldest city in the United States, up in the northeast coast of Florida.  And then we were sent home to my grandmother and my mother who had finished college in three and a half years at Florida Normal College [currently Florida Memorial University, Miami Gardens, Florida], which was located then in, in St. Augustine and later, many years later moved to Miami, took a job as a secretary in the capital city, Tallahassee [Florida], another Native American name, which is the capital of Florida, at Florida A and M Agricultural and Mechanical University [Tallahasse, Florida].  She was not earning enough money to have housing.  She stayed in the woman's dormitory and so my brother and I were sent to live with my grandmother and, of course, then we became a part of that social network of my grandmother, that walking network where you went to visit her friends.  So the black women stand out most significantly.  I mean there many images of men and stories that I remember but in sense, in terms of getting a sense of humanity and humanity in the sense of attention given to us, interest in who we were and what we were about and as a role model, it was clearly Lizzy James Hampton, my grandmother.  So much so that my mother still thinks that you guys think you never had a mother, you only had a grandmother.  I mean we had a--we have a great moms and she always was.  She always worked very hard to really give all attention and resources to my and my brother's development.  But, yes, my grandmother was quite the center of my world, one that when I discovered that she had cancer, at eighty-fives--never occurred to me that she wouldn't be here forever.  I mean, I was in my twenties, late twenties probably and married but, yeah, she, she was quite a force and therein a memory of black women and the community of women is a part of the bedrock reflection of who I am, notwithstanding how often I may have strayed and I certainly have often times strayed from that or I have even been contradictory in what I learned to be more narrow perspectives of manhood, but I always come back to those memories.
Story_ID: 88954
Speaker 1: Okay. Well could you tell us about your father?  Could you give us his full name and spell it for us.
Speaker 2: My father, James Tweetie, T-W-E-E-T-I-E, Early, E-A-R-L-Y.  He was from--he was born in Brunson, B-R-U-N-S-O-N, South Carolina, right outside, maybe five to eight miles outside of a little place called Earlysville.  I've never known if there was a lineage connection but I suspect it may be--may have been General O. O. Early [sic, General Jubal Early] or whatever his name, the southern Confederate general.  But my father moved with his parents to St. Augustine, Florida and I'm not sure exactly at what age; I remember him from being very young.  I mean I can remember my father lived from the time that I must have been probably as young as three years old.  I may even have a memory earlier than that of lying on his chest any number of times in that house in St. Augustine, Florida, right down by the old fort in St. Augustine, Florida.  And they had some kind of contraption where you had a milk bottle, it had an electrical something on it and you hooked it in--so that warm milk memory is probably what reminds me of the visual--limited but consistently recalled visual imagery.  When my father and mother [Altobelle Hampton] separated--I want to think I must have been somewhere ten, eleven years old when I started asking to go to see my father; although he had come to Tallahassee, Florida on a few occasions, he and some of his buddies, my father became an alcoholic.  I can't say how early, he probably was always a drinker.  I know in later adulthood it was very clear to me that he was an alcoholic but he would show up in Tallahassee, I think probably on two occasions I recall, but I had this yearning to see him and my mother, bless her heart, who never said a negative word against him, although I can remember him hitting her, I must have been, again, three, four years old.  I can remember this imagery in the kitchen in St. Augustine, Florida.  She put me on a bus.  It was like three and a half, four hours from--straight shot from Tallahassee, Florida to St. Augustine, Florida.  My uncle lived there.  He would pick me up and my uncle lived probably three-quarters of a mile from my father.  And I would walk up and see my father and I built a very, very strong and consistent relationship with my father until he died.  I was in the room with him when he died.  I think probably from the time I was somewhere between ten and twelve, I saw him every year of my life until he died, except the one year that I was in Central America and my second year in college.  But--
Story_ID: 88955
Speaker 1: I had a very strong relationship that I built with him [James Tweetie Early, father], more so than he built with me.  He recognized me as his son and he treated me with kindness and he was proud to show me off.  This is my boy, you know, I went to the bars.  I can remember, I went into the bars from the time--I probably have a memory, again, three, four years old in segregated St. Augustine, Florida, down on Washington Street, where all the black men congregated.  I can remember bars with Calvert, this, with the plumage, the big hat and the plumage and the sword, you know calvage--Calvert Liquor and the big wooden bars that you would see--later I would recognize in westerns.  I can even remember one with a swinging door--with the jalousie wooden doors, where my father would plop me up on one of them on the bar and what I came to know later as the Schlitz glass, that stem glass when Schlitz was advertising in the early years of television.  I would--they would give me a glass of coconut milk.  Now my uncle whom I told the story too many times and we've gone down to Washington Street many times, although that's all now gone and gentrified, he has no memory of that so I wonder whether--how I might have invented what may have been the stimulus for me to have such details but I, I had fond memories and relations with my father. And then I saw a whole 'nother dimension--how the sort of sociology, if you will, of African American men, inter-generational groups, where they were many octogenarians around, you know, who came to the bar and their sons and sometimes their grandsons were in the bar and I have those, those memories.  And for years, when I would go back to St. Augustine, Florida, I eventually went back to take care of him, to put him in a private home when he became debilitated with dementia, although he had a historical memory, he didn't have really a contemporary memory.  So I built a very strong tie with him and I took my sons there.  We recognized this in St. Augustine, Florida, the wonderful vacation town, wonderful beach and I--after a couple of years going down there by myself, I decided why should I be going by myself.  We'll make a vacation of it and my wife and I would rent a little kitchenette in Holiday Inn down in the rocky part of St. Augustine Beach where I had gone as a kid; that used to be a black beach, owned by a black man called Butler.  There was many--several black owned beaches throughout the southeastern part of the United States so I had a memory of going down there probably, again, three, four, five years old, when cars would drive out onto the beach and it was all flat and it wasn't built up--but when--then it was built up and we would rent a place and I would take my children, my wife and I would go down and we'd spend a week, sometimes two weeks. So I had a very close relationship with my father.  And more or less died--I mean I was in the room when he died and the last ten days, I fed him and talked to him and massaged him and cleaned him and probably the richest ten days that I ever spent 'cause I felt like I had completed any basic obligation of a child, of a son to a father and I felt good about it although the pain of watching him die was traumatic.  So, yeah, I had a very strong tie to him.
Story_ID: 88956
Speaker 1: Yeah, my father [James Tweetie Early]--I mean the relationship I built with my father--I'm at a point in my life now at fifty-six where I've always been one who dialogues with himself.  I'm sort of my worst critic and my most consistent companion in a sense of saying it, I'm someone always talking to myself.  I have a very close tie to my own sons, who are twenty-seven and twenty-four and I wonder to what extent that history, both absence and familiarity with my father, might indeed play into that.  I am more aware of the depths of the relationship with my sons at this point in my life, in which, on the one hand, I wanted them to be somewhat more emotionally distant from me and--but I realize that I have another ongoing stage, perhaps for the rest of my life of fatherhood that I had not anticipated before because we are both buddies and we are very clearly father, son.  And the tactical relationship that I have with my sons, the confidential--I mean they talk to me and their mother basically about everything to such--sometimes to some extent it's embarrassing.  And I say, I don't want to hear anymore.  But that's the way that we raised them.  And, so I'm reflecting a lot now what might have been out of my own background, both absence and closeness to my father that might deed--indeed and formed the way that I've dealt with my sons and the kind of relationship that I have with them.  So, in that regard, notwithstanding the harsh and even cruel dimensions of the relationship between my mother [Altobelle Hampton] and father and the--I can't say the pain of separation--I don't know that I ever felt the pain of separation as a child but clearly I was aware of it.  Both--on both counts, both mother, father, grand--particularly on my mother's side, my grandmother [Lizzy James Hampton], are really ongoing sources of strength in the present for me.
Story_ID: 88957
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now your--how did your parents meet?  Did they meet when your mother [Altobelle Hampton] was in school?
Speaker 2: My, my parents met while my mother was in school.  My father [James Tweetie Early] was twenty some odd years older than my mother.  And my mother had actually been married once before, something she does not talk about and I have not learned to talk to her about it, although I think I've learned a little about it.  She must have probably, I don't know, probably have been as young as eighteen or nineteen years old, from a guy from Ocala, Florida, whose name--my uncle knows the name and we were actually looking at some photographs, the two of us, my uncle and I recently, he says, you know, that was your mother's boyfriend.  I'm sure that's him.  But that history is so deep and so buried that I don't know that even my mother can retrieve it in any significant way.  I think she has had one of those compartmentalized approaches to life and some things she's perhaps buried so deeply that she cannot retrieve and certainly there are clearly things she's not wanted to talk about and they're intriguing to me but they're not particularly significant--so, but they, yeah, they met while she was in college.  And my father, considerably older, I've not asked actually how they met but I, you know, my sort of imaginative reconstruction would be that at the school you probably had a lot of older black guys who, I mean you had all these young college girls there and the social life--I mean Florida Normal [College, St. Augustine, Florida, currently Florida Memorial University, Miami, Florida] was way out, outside of the city limits, although there was a black residential area but it was outside of the jurisdiction of public water and electricity and things of that sort.  And so that the--in a segregated community in St. Augustine [Florida] was one of the most segregated, fiercely segregated cities in the south and when Martin Luther King went through there many, many years later, it was like going through Cicero, outside of Chicago.  People, I think, were stunned at how virulent the racism was there.  So I can only imagine that there was a very small social space for young black and young educated black people.  So, you know, there were the bars.  There was one movie house and--or your outlet was church and if it was both, then you ran into a cross-generational group of black men.  And so I can only imagine that my father was, you know, was a handsome guy and a fast talker, you know, and, you know, enterprising guy, a lot of energy, you know, he, he owned what they called the pressing club or cleaners.  I guess the terms pressing club comes from the notion of a historical apprenticeship and my uncle was in with him, although I'm told that my father basically drank up all the money and then I can recall in one of his houses, he had a little store in the front and, so he was enterprising, like many, many black men of the time.
Story_ID: 88958
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now tell me about--what about your grandparents on your father's [James Tweetie Early] side?  Did you have much contact with them?
Speaker 2: I didn't have much contact with them; although in a certain sense, they play a role, I guess in sort of my imagination about where our history may have come from and my own sort of evolving steps of identification, trying to figure out identity-wise, you know, who I have been and as I'm still, in many ways, inquiring of myself, who am I, in many ways.  My, my grandmother on my father's side, I have very few actual memories of engagement with her but I have a photograph of her that just illuminates my early childhood.  Her name was Ora, O-R-A.  I don't know her middle name.  And, she was called Ora but that was such an odd distinct name and as I grew older, you know, just hearing that name and then the whole notion of Ora, which makes me think there may have been a West Indian background.  That's my own imagination that's further extended in there, although they were from out of South Carolina is my grandfather, my father's father.  His name was Garfield, again, a very English sort of West Indian like name.  And, I'm a Latin Americanist, Caribbeanist by training.  I travel a lot in lot in Latin America and the Caribbean and, of course, it's all imagination.  There's no historical genealogy that informs this but looking at their photographs and their physical make-up and what not, it just has made me wonder and it also has made me wonder is that an escape from your African American-ness to a some kind of more romantic identify and what not.  But in an actual sense, they played very little role in and certainly as compared to my mother's mother, my grandmother [Lizzy James Hampton] or even her mother, my great grandmother, Rachel James, who lived in a log cabin and who I lived in that log cabin, have photographs of it and, you know, the smoke house and all of that so, you know, very little of an influence--of a direct influence from my father's parents.
Speaker 1: Now what's the--you mentioned an earlier connection to--to the General Early--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, again, that's something that I--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Jubal Early?
Speaker 2: Jubal Early.  I said General O. O. but it's Jubal Early.  Again, I've not done any inquiry and the name Early, the older I've gotten, the more that the name surfaces either E-A-R-L-Y as mine is spelled or E-A-R-L-E-Y.  But geographically, you know, I run into people now spread all over, you know, Denver or all other kinds of places so I've just not done any of the geological historical work.
Story_ID: 88959
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright, well, tell me about--you told us a lot about growing up within the context of the two stories of your parents but give us the sense of some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up and you were in a couple different places--right--growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, you know, the early sights and sounds are very agriculturally based.  I mean in Dunnellon, Florida, again, in the black community that grew up in there with--no paved roads so when it rained, they turned to mud.  I walked probably not quite a half mile, perhaps a half mile but back and forth to get kerosene for the--to go down to the gas station to buy kerosene--little scrawny boy, trying not to drop any of that kerosene in that, you know, holding that can and it beating your leg so you'd have a little kerosene stain on it.  So kerosene is a very poignant smell, both for the purposes of fuel but also when we had severe chest colds, with a lot of fluid and what not in our chest, my grandmother [Lizzy James Hampton] would take a table spoon of sugar and drop a few drops of kerosene in it and you would take that and, of course, that kerosene would just open your chest and break up all of that cold.  I remember years later, I was grown, I think I had a child then and I mentioned this to my grandmother.  And she says, baby they don't make kerosene the way they used to make it.  You shouldn't do this with your children.  My grandmother, like many people around, raised chickens and so corn, the smell of corn, of going, watching her going to the chicken yard to fight off those bad roosters and with her apron full of corn, dropping corn out, out, my great grandmother's [Rachel James], we would often go out there on Sunday.  She had chickens, ducks and guinea hens and so the smell of corn--the smell of the earth because everybody tilled the soil and, you know, after the season was over and the re-tilling of going out and picking up the remaining sweet potatoes that were out there that you could put under the pump, run water over them and just bite into a sweet potato because it's naturally sweet and rich.  Going into the woods, I mean we were, we really lived in, right on the woods' edge and walking through the forest to go down to the Withlacoochee River where my grandmother fished so the smell of the bait bed, the black rich dirt and where my grandmother grew her fishing worms, where we would go out and put meal on it for the--or the boiling black cauldron, a smoke pot with the stick in it where you would turn those clothes; and fruits, you know, the peach trees and the snap beans, all of those are very important olfactory stimuli for me, if you will, that I remember from that agricultural based. You know when I went to Tallahassee, Florida at age seven, then life changed.  I mean, I went to the capital city, you know, when to a public school.  It was a quite different life and it was quite a psychological adjustment for me.
Story_ID: 88960
Speaker 1: Well, yes, it was St. Augustine [Florida] we were talking about.
Speaker 2: Well, we had--I sort of transitioned from those smells and sounds of--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You know moving to the capital city [Tallahassee, Florida] at age seven to formally start public school, the sounds, the sights were quite different.  It was no longer the fresh fish or guts of fresh fish, you know, cleaning or scaling fish, that was a routine activity when I was in Dunnellon, Florida with my grandmother [Lizzy James Hampton].  She fished three or four times a week and she was quite a fisher person and now I was in an area with really large school systems, a very diverse population in which I had no familiarity with and psychologically it was quite an adjustment.  I ran home from school, I don't know how many days of the first month or so because the kids would taunt me.  I was the new boy on the block and I'd run right by the bus.  I was--I don't know it's a good mile and a half, two miles to Polkinghorne Village, the--which was the projects of the university, which was nice housing; although my mother [Altobell Hampton] was making so little money that my grandmother, who really had no money herself, took her stove out of her own house, put on a--had it put on a truck, probably paid the driver fifteen, twenty dollars or maybe even less to drive those couple hundred miles to bring her stove and refrigerator to our apartment.  And she stayed with us so this was a change.  My mother, at that point, had been cooking for us on a hotplate.  You know, we had a television.  I remember--saw out television and thought that if you walked in front of the television naked, they could see you (laughter), probably like many kids since this was a new thing.
Story_ID: 88961
Speaker 1: And the first year of my first grade, you know, I was at a public school where the principal would come out and tap dance on Fridays.  I, these are historical measures now that are very significant.  I can't think of that principal's name but--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--he would tap dance?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--he would tap dance for the students in a assembly.  So it's a sign of a different--of an earlier era--a different era--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It's an all-black school?
Speaker 1: It's an all-black school in the working class section of Tallahassee [Florida]--on the black community was all around town but this was on the Florida A and M University [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida]side, Bond Jr. High School and with the red clay all around it and--but my second year I was enrolled at the demonstration school at Florida A and M University in Lucy Moten High School where these were mostly, not exclusively, but mostly the kids, the people who worked at the university; administrators, professors, service people at the university, janitorial engineers and, and the like, whose kids went there, some very, very bright kids and, I guess, that's where I really became perhaps more academic minded.  My teachers were very well trained.  They were very meticulous.  They were very systematic in teaching, reading and those kinds of things.  And these kids were, were quick and bright.  And, I began to get a different kind of identity and years later, I would look back.  I can't really say how many years.  It was probably post to high school when I became more conscious of it.
Story_ID: 88962
Speaker 1: Is that going back to Dunnellon, Florida every summer probably 'til I was fifteen or sixteen to give my mother [Altobelle Hampton] a break of these two rambunctious boys she was raising, that country, that rural agricultural life and those relationships and all of those women and old black men and churches, all of that stayed with me.  I didn't--I'm not a church-goer.  I mean when I went to my grandmother's [Lizzy James Hamtpon], you had to go to church but also being in a metropolitan university town in an atmosphere of learning, of being right there on a college campus seeing year after year kids from all over Florida and other places from around the country coming to college, that certainly set a learning context for me as I look back that made a big, big difference in my life.  And in hindsight, I can say it made a difference that it probably didn't make for a lot of people who I was around, who came from similar circumstances.  I didn't know it at the time and I don't know that they knew it at the time, a lot of them had come from, from around Apalachicola [Florida], or from twenty-five miles out from around Tallahassee, Florida, where it was all wooded, rural area and still had family in rural communities that they would go back and forth and see.  But there was something that happened with my brother and I, we've not been able to trace it--the way that we speak.  People say you don't have a southern accent.  My brother and I in terms of the tone of our voices are sometimes almost indistinguishable.  My mother is a good case study of that issue.  She often says when we're on the telephone; she doesn't know which of us it may be initially.  I think watching television, you know, I watched television and I would articulate from what I heard on television.  I'm--I was very conscious of that.  I don't know why.  I don't that whether I was trying to distinguish myself from something or what I may have been trying to acquire.  But years later, I would reflect on that.  I had what I would call a very good synthesis of that rural agricultural grounding and this sort of now metropolitan beginning to be cosmopolitan outlook.  And I became--I was different.  I knew that there was something, at least in my own head, and so my sort of anti-establishment behavior--I was around a lot of bright kids, who would just amaze me, you know, Dr. Robert Hall now, who graduated from Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  In fifth grade, who we would make these shoe box pictorial things like, you know, you would, you would script it out and storylines--I'm trying--I'm forgetting what the name is--and these guys had the most elaborate stories and drawings and what not and the way that they did their math.  I was really impressed with all of that and while I was not as academically bright, I was stimulated.  I had an athleticism that they did not have and I had a background coming out of the country where, you know, I had fighting dogs and I lived in the project of the university, which was not a ghetto.  It's not run down but it was not the same higher socio-economic circumstance as my peers.  Many of them, when their parents were graduate students or young students or young professors had also lived in Polkinghorne Village but I had seen them move out.  I didn't understand the economic distinctions between their parent's income and my mother's income.  But eventually we, too, moved.  My mother got a house up on the main part of the university, right down from the world-renowned Jake Gaither, who was the football coach of Florida A [Agricultural] and M [Mechanical] University's outstanding football team, the blood, sweat and tear teams.  He wrote books on the split line offense and Cannonball Adderley's lived right down the street from me.  I didn't know this at the time, his mother taught me when I began to go to the episcopal school, green lawns, people with cars and I began to realize, what in hindsight, was a class differentiation but I didn't feel bothered by that.  I felt quite comfortable in that sort of dual identity that I had.  And it began to give me a space, an outspoken space where I found--one, I found I was articulate.  I found that I was willing to take people and adults on.  I wanted to distinguish myself.  And I was quite athletic and enjoyed football and track and running and was able to--but again, both that country part was also there and I was, I was really pleased that I, that I had that and somehow I had not lost that.
Story_ID: 88963
Speaker 1: Okay.  You went to an episcopal school (unclear)--
Speaker 2: No, I, I, I joined the Episcopal Church and I joined out of a sense of again, looking for group affiliation, probably more so group validation.  You know, I saw these kids like Timmy Lewis, who wanted to be a film maker, who is still a very dear friend of mine, whose father was a part of the agricultural department at Florida A and M [Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] and whose mother, I didn't know at the time, who's still alive, was of Jamaican background.  They were--he and Bobby Hall and Willie Rivers, who was an adopted kid from across town, would come up in an--the black orphanage, very hard life.  He and I were running buddies.  Mrs. DiCorsi (ph.), who worked at the university, who had a beautiful brick home with a Florida room, lived right down the street, once we moved on main campus.  They all went to the Episcopal Church. So I was looking for, not just group identification; I was looking for some kind of a social validation.  So I became an acolyte, you know, I went to church.  I took the catechism, didn't believe in God then, don't believe in God now.  But it provided some social stability.  There was not a lot of trouble you could get in in Tallahassee, Florida, I mean, you know, there was no drugs.  If somebody drank alcohol, you know, kids had a half a pint and it be eight of them (laughter).  So there was very little damage--cigarette smoking was probably about the baddest thing that I was aware that was, that was going on and while we all wanted to be sexually active, there probably were very few of us who were.  It was just a different time.  But--so I joined the episcopal church, and, you know, I learned the "Kyrie Eleison" and did midnight masses and wore that little red robe with the white overlay and all--and but eventually that played itself out.  I was never--I didn't have a religious fervor.  I was never struck by some extra-terrestrial sense of omnipotence and the like.  And I think my peer group were generally believers of some kind but I was not.  But going there was, you know, Father Brooks was a nice priest and had a godmother who was somewhat older than my mother [Altobelle Hampton], Louise Fields, who was my sixth grade teacher that I gave hell.  I was--I'd come of that age where, you know, kids began to act out, as your insides seemed to change.  You wake up and here is somebody different and, you know, a child trying to be a man, that kind of struggle that I think people go through, young people go through.  But Mrs. Fields, I can recall going to--I'm trying to think of the name of the church--oh, it's escaping me now, where they read poetry and they had baked, home-made baked cookies and it was not a theology.  It was really a more humanism.  But these were all--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Unitarian?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Unitarian, which was over on Florida State University's campus, which was the predominantly white university and, which was, you know, couple--a mile and a half away on the other hill.  But this was all intellectually stimulating and I was aware that it was giving me a broader, more intellectually academic kind of world view; although I didn't--those are not the terms that I would have used at that time.  I probably didn't have any terms, words per se, but I could feel myself sort of expanding, if you will.
Speaker 1: It seems like you--as though--I mean the Episcopal Church is the--it's the almost opposite of like the country church.
Speaker 2: Right, of the Baptist, Methodist, I don't even--I still don't know the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: The denomination--
Speaker 2: Denominations well.  But quite different from that more engaging and certainly fervent experience in my grandmother's [Lizzy James Hampton] church where people became possessed and the lining the hymns and the engagement, the strength of the choir, the Episcopal was a much more somber, almost meditative kind of approach.  And I didn't have a choice of one over the other in a real sense but in terms of looking for social validation, 'cause it was not spirit, spirituality or religion that was moving me, the episcopal church provided an important institutional affiliation for me at the time but nothing having to do with my religious formation 'cause I really didn't have any.
Speaker 1: This is interesting.
Story_ID: 88964
Speaker 1: In the sense that you, you had rich church experiences but you did not necessarily have a religious fervor and, you know, I think a lot of people may feel that way but they don't necessarily, they don't acknowledge it or something, you know.  I don't know.  You're able, it seems to me you had an ability to step back from things and observe.
Speaker 2: I think that's a good observation, a good summary on your part.  I did, perhaps that is what I was doing and it has served me well in one way and in another way it hasn't.  It has really served me well as being an independent thing of finding my own way, making my own way.  On the other hand, it has perhaps alienated me to some extent from certain basic institutional arrangements in the African American community.  When I went to college, I had no interest in joining a frat; although at times, you know, I now in hindsight see that it was not all frivolous, that there is some serious social service dimensions to it and there is a comradery among those guys that--I have individual friends not--I don't have institutional friendships; either church or fraternal or civic organization.  And I often ask myself, at this point, if I'm fortunate to grow to be seventy-five or eighty, you know what will my wife and I, how will we relate and those things become, I think very, very important.  But I, so, on the one hand, a certain kind of early independence and self-discovery because I was not tethered to institutional arrangements that tend to be rather conserving, not necessarily conservative but conserving as opposed to being expansive and experimental developed in my life.  And so I feel that developmental tension, I guess I would term it at this point in my life.  And I've felt it for some time, yeah.
Story_ID: 88965
Speaker 1: Okay. Now when you were in high school [Lucy Moten High School, Tallahassee, Florida], were you a good student?
Speaker 2: I was an average student.  I was an average student in high school, an average student at Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia] and an average graduate student, although you had to make at least all B's in graduate school.  I've always been an average academic performer.  I've been fortunate, and there's certain--probably a skill level that I don't have, a full articulation of that has always made me in terms of the job market and what not.  I have--I'm at the, you know, the top line of what I have done in terms of acknowledgement and authority and remuneration and things of that sort.  But as an academic student, I was an average student.  I was not a very disciplined student.  There was some things that I was a hard worker on.  I mean my under graduate degree is in Spanish, a language I use almost daily and I really had a knack for foreign language.  I speak Spanish.  I speak Portuguese.  I studied Mandarin and Chinese.  I studied French.  I have an ear, that's something inherent that I was able to become more conscious of.  My teachers were before I was aware of it; that I was able to perform very well in the--some of the wrote learning, the methodological approaches to learning and the way the people taught language that time, have complimented other dimensions of my professional and social ability.  I'm aware of that, that there is that collateral spin off, if you will, a cross-over.  But I loved--I enjoyed learning, you know.  I had a ball at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  I, I went to college as a 13th grade.  I didn't really.  My mother [Altobelle Hampton] says you're going to college.  She says you're going to Morehouse.  I had a partial scholarship to go to West Virginia State.  But she wanted me to go to Morehouse for some historical reasons, out of her own background.  And--
Story_ID: 88966
Speaker 1: So that's where I went and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Now when you were a senior in high school [Lucy Moten High School, Tallahassee, Florida], did you have any specific aspirations for career or anything?
Speaker 1: No, I think it's probably telling that in my high school yearbook, it says, career interest, psychology.  It's probably 'cause I was learning to play mental games to manipulate things by way of speech and out-thinking, out flanking, I mean.  That's probably what it was a reflection of.  I, there was no reason I had any clear interest in psychology and, of course, I ended up with an undergraduate degree in Spanish, you know (laughter), so far away from psychology and I still don't have any professional aspirations.  I say to my sons and I say to college students and what not, if you know what you want to be, that's good, go after it, but don't be disconcerted if you're not sure what you want to be.  That happens to some people, not all of us find a straight line from here to there.  And you can still have a full, professional life.  You'll, but you'll have to be inventive and you have to be at ease of inventing yourself and expanding yourself and that's, that's not the way that I sent out to do.  I didn't have any formulation on it.  These are now all reflections on a mid-life stage.  But I, I, you know, I've been pleased with it.  It's not that it's not had hard moments because when you, when you've got a discipline and you've got certain goals in life, when times are hard, you have something concrete to measure it against.  When you don't have a discipline and you're sort of moving along creating it, feels like you're ambling along.  It feels like you're out of the standard.  You're not a part of the status quo.  That can be very weighty on you and I certainly have had those moments.  And I watch my own sons now, who I think are going through similar stages that I went through and I'm able to give them some reflection of--something for them to think about but it doesn't so much ease the burden of uncertainty.  You know, when you're running with the pack, there is a certain stability with that and when you are either out there by yourself, whether you're running against it, you know that you're not with the status quo and certainly those are things that I balance back and forth in my own life but--
Story_ID: 88967
Speaker 1: Now, okay.  It seems clear that you're not really running with the pack here and you go to Morehouse which is a very--sort of a stayed--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes (laughter)--
Speaker 1: --Institution, shall we say--how did you find Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and how did Morehouse find you?
Speaker 2: Well, first I--the way that I ended up at Morehouse--two factors here; my high school principal, Mr. Estaras, E-S-T-A-R-A-S, big man with a full head of wavy hair, fair complexion.  I don't when it occurred to me that he was not "a black man" or the--what my traditional conception of it.  He was Cuban.  I never heard him speak a word of Spanish.  His English was perfect.  There was no accent.  He had a very resonant voice and unfortunately I never went back to interview him.  He was a stern man, fair, but stern.  He saw something in me that I did not know was in myself.  He was a Morehouse graduate, was married to a black American woman, brown skin, fair brown skinned woman like himself but I often wondered culturally how he had to negotiate that.  I've spent a lot of time in Cuba, over the last twenty-eight years.  Now I know that wow, boy, that must have been a difficult, taxing identity issue, to be Cuban and would have been a mulatto there or maybe not even called a mulatto in Cuba or in the Cuban community.  I think he was a part of the Tampa [Florida] Ybor City community, that was a long-standing immigrant community.  When Dean Brazil, who wrote the first book, definitive book on the Pullman Car Porters, Phi Beta Kappa, Columbia University came to Morehouse to recruit, they would do a, you know, they would go out to various schools and he was, Dean Brazil, one of the chief administrators of Morehouse--I had no idea who he was.  I didn't even know he was coming.  I got--one of my teachers says the principal wants you to come up to his office.  And I think there were three of us.  The other two guys had very high grades, I think one was probably Timmy Lewis.  The other was probably Aliman (ph.) Austin, who--he and his sister finished Val [valedictorian] and Sal [salutatorian] in the class, I think.  His father was a dean of education and had a civil rights history coming out of Roanoke, Virginia, which I don't know a lot about.  And there was me, the C student.  So I remember asking Dean Brazil, I said so do you give football scholarships?  He said, we play football but we don't give any athletic scholarships.  And I'm thinking, wow, Morehouse.  This is prestigious school.  It never occurred to me that I could even consider going to Morehouse.  And then I'm thinking, okay, I'm a C student.  Nobody is gonna give me any money.  How is my mother [Altobelle Hampton] going to get me to Morehouse.  And so I'm thinking, I'll play for--I'm more than a fair football player, give me some, you know, 300 dollars a semester.  That would have been good enough 'cause they had a poor team (laughter).  I didn't know that at the time but that would help.  The Dean Hudson--I think he was called the dean.  He was Reverend Hudson, he had one arm.  I don't know if he lost his arm in the military.  He worked at Florida A [Agricultural] and M [Mechanical] University [Tallahassee, Florida].  He may have even been a chaplain.  I'm just not sure.  His son is a big time lawyer here in Washington, D.C., who also went to Morehouse but was maybe five years or so older than me.  He and--I forget the other doctor's name at Florida A and M University, were both West Virginia State [Institute, West Virginia] graduates.  And there was a third one.  They--every year, they gave a partial scholarship to some student, I guess, coming out of my high school.  I didn't know this as a historical factor but I was identified and selected.  I met with the three of them and they were going to support my going to West Virginia State.  I don't know what the factors may have been.  It may have been, okay, here's a C student with promise, comes from a single parent home of a mother who's worked very hard and has raised two wonderful children, been very productive.  I mean, just who knows, the number of factors.
Story_ID: 88968
Speaker 1: And they described West Virginia State [University, Institute, West Virginia] up in the valley and how I would like it and my mother [Altobelle Hampton] said, you're going to Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  My mother had been offered a scholarship to go to Spelman College [Atlanta, Georgia], the all girls' school across the street from Morehouse when she came out of high school [Hard Rock High School, Dunnellon, Florida].  It was a partial scholarship.  Her--she didn't have the money.  Her mother [Lizzy James Hampton] didn't have the money and I found a letter, which I still have years later of a letter she wrote to her brother saying the boys from Morehouse are at Florida Normal [College, St. Augustine, Florida] to play football, and just the tone, the poetic quality of the letter.  My mother was a great writer.  I just felt like, in part, maybe I was living out something she was unable to live out.  So she put me on a bus and the last thing she said to me was, you will not have as many clothes and as much money as the other kids at Morehouse.  Now my mother, not unlike many black parents of that time, and perhaps even still today, and perhaps white parents or Latino parents, etc. never set foot on Morehouse College's campus.  I got on a bus.  I went to this huge city.  I probably been out of the state of Florida two or three times in my life, probably only once that I was really--twice that I can really remember, short focused trips, one to Carolina and one to Tuskegee [Alabama].  I think a day run to Tuskegee.  So it was like stepping out into the universe.  Big city Atlanta and I get off the bus, I don't know Morehouse is, how I'm gonna get there, you know, I got this suitcase.  I got these couple of pairs of new tweed jeans, banlons was the rage at the time, you know, I got a couple of banlon shirts, some bucks on and my godmother, Mrs. Louise Fields, I think she had ordered the suit, had bought me a, I think a three piece tweed suit where the jacket was reversible or something.  And I had worked that summer and bought myself a pair of bad, really wonderful loafers, which was--I have a shoe fetish so that was probably my first (laughter) real step towards beginning to develop some sense of taste and there I was off to Morehouse.  And--
Story_ID: 88969
Speaker 1: The psychological trauma of thinking I was going to flunk out, you know, my mid-term, I had, I don't know, three or four D's.  I mean I was working as hard as I could.  Well, that's not quite true.  I was working hard but I didn't have a discipline.  And, and I had found a cohort of friends and, in hindsight, that cohort was a group that was probably as--unstable is not a good term here--who probably did not feel--who like me, didn't feel particularly comfortable in that atmosphere.  Now it happens with all college students.  We were not peculiar in that regard.  But we found social activity, you know, I discovered cigarettes.  I didn't smoke when I came out of high school [Lucy Moten High School].  I discovered alcohol.  I mean I knew these things existed but I was no longer an athlete per se. So marijuana came in, probably--not my freshman year--probably when I came back.  Heroin came in--so you start to meet a seamier, seedy side of social life, of hustlers and all of that.  And then my grades, and I would think, my goodness, what will the people back home, if I flunk out of Morehouse, suddenly a sense of social obligation to all of those who had good hope for you of succeeding.  And--but I found a rhythm, you know, I eventually found the rhythm, I'm not gonna be a mathematician so if you can get through math with a D, I'm not gonna put a big moral strain on it. I'm not going to be a philosopher so philosophy was one of the hardest courses, you get through it with a D.  And there were courses, you know, I made B's in and a lot of courses, I made C's in, that I, you know, you risked--if you had worked a little harder, you'd a had a B and occasionally I would get an A and I think I was on the honor roll once.  And--but I had a great time.  The Canterbury House, an episcopal center, was an intellectual and activist rich fertile ground, where I met guys who were protesting the Vietnam War, like E. [Edmund] Barry Gaither [HM], who's gone on to be one of the renowned curators of African American art in Boston [Massachusetts], who was from some little town in South Carolina who had had the most rich and (unclear) British accent that you would ever want, want to hear (laughter).  And I would--and these guys had oratorical styles and they read.  And some of them were pipe smokers and there were some pretty girls and, and Reverend Scott, who was the minister would divide us up into little clubs on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, I think.  He'd cook rice, green peas and chicken and he'd give you a question and he'd put five or six of you together and occasionally he would sit in and we'd have these way-out, rich, deep philosophical conversations, none of the topics that I can remember but he would also hold these dinners with like the head of the Atlanta [Journal] Constitution.  And I always had a sense that the president in the Atlanta University Center sort of resented how he carried himself but they were obliged to come 'cause he would--and there were these very--it was a very stimulating environment and here the Episcopal Church reappears again, not as a religious but as a deeper social intellectual place.
Story_ID: 88970
Speaker 1: Yeah, talk about this experimentation with--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I think the experimentation--when I think there's something about youth probably generally and perhaps in all cultures, but certainly in this culture where you want to test yourself against certain kinds of things.  There's a kind of immature sense of competitiveness, whether it's a spelling bee or who writes the best essay.  And then for those of us who are not particularly academic, you know, you sort of move off--you want to engage in the adult life, you know, whether it's cigarette smoking or it's beer drinking or, you know, it's getting hard alcohol and then with the change in society, drugs become--began to come into the south.  First it was marijuana and, of course, the euphoria of getting high was a good feeling.  It suspends reality and it was all fun and games and, you know, smoking reefer and buyer reefer and going places to get reefer at that time was almost sort of idyllic and romantic, you know, there were no guns around.  It was like the hip, like California dreaming, all the songs and what not.  Heroin then comes, cocaine--you don't see a lot of cocaine 'cause you don't have the money to get to it but heroin being a cheap drug.  Then we had students at Morehouse [Atlanta, Georgia], don't want to indict anyone grew a lot of them from the north, most of them from the north but all of us from all around were partakers.  Guys who were familiar with the drug culture and who were maturing in their own developmental trajectory into that and they would come back with good weed or they would come then with heroin and occasionally cocaine.  And the needles started to show up and so we all, you know, cough syrup, all those kinds of things.  And these are probably all signs of lack of discipline, focus and perhaps even some psycho-health problems that you just don't, as you see as you get older.  That's how people become alcoholics or abusive to women or something.  It's not necessarily always there but--and the--not to blame anyone, the health services at Morehouse or any other of those schools at the time, these older people were not aware of the changing times, what were the indices of these kinds of new developments that they should pursue and inquire on.  What might be the psychological state of kids, you know, how you deal with that, what they may gravitate towards and so, again, I think that's a--as I said being a professional, eclectic as I describe myself today, even at that age, I dabbled in a lot of things but did not get very deep into any one thing which was a saving grace for me with regard to the drugs.  So I spent a lot of time at the Canterbury House, with the egghead intellectuals.  I chased the girls with dudes who were, you know, chasing girls.  Loved that and spent time on the corner, you know, with the wine drinkers and a knives would show up or, you know, occasional scraps, fights or something but in later years, guns would show up.  And then a broader, social crowd of non-college students who were in the trade, you begin to run into that.  And, you know, I had Latino partners who were swimmers, who I used to tease that they were being exploited 'cause you couldn't find a Latin woman anywhere around.  I said you couldn't find a Latina in 500 miles of here, which is somewhat of an exaggeration, probably.  But these guys were great swimmers and Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] was won the small college swimming championship one or two years while I was here and these guys were on the swimming team.  Some of them, not all of them, not even the majority of them, and not all of them were Latinos, were dealing with drugs.  One, Rigoberto Cintron, you know, a dear friend of mine, who was shooting heroin.  I think, the first time I experimented with heroin was with--it was with him, who died of an overdose in a house full of guys.  I happened to be away that weekend.  And then I saw, you know, friends, peers, become addicts and you begin to see the broader side of human--deeper, more problematic side of humanity; theft, you know, guys who were your friends, you would see them steal from friends.  They became slick.  A hustle began to go on.  And, you know, I was sort of intrigued and attracted to that and at the same time, I had a somewhat safe distance from it.  And most of us made it out and probably with some baggage and some scars even today, some of us didn't make it out.  Lot of guys are now dead.  A few of them died then.  But, yeah, that was a period that I--and I talk about it because one, it's liberating.  I mean, I'm facing our history is a way of really, for me, trying to find firmer footing for the next steps for this now shorter future.  I mean, I'm probably in the last quarter of my life in a sense of speaking and how to go into this period in a more rich way; and then sharing that with young adults, and particularly with my sons, that they might avoid because some of the same psychological pressures or same psychological lackings are strengths any younger generation will have, and they will not escape that and these alternatives are out there and so how to handle that is--could also be helpful to them.
Story_ID: 88971
Speaker 1: So you were at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] from, I'm sorry, from '65 [1965]--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: From '65 [1965]--I was there '65 [1965], '66 [1966]. '66 [1966], '67 [1967] I was in the Panama Canal Zone in Canal Zone College [sic, Panama Canal College].  My mother [Altobelle Hampton] remarried a few weeks after I finished high school [Lucy Moten High School, Tallahassee, Florida] and my stepfather, who is about to celebrate his 88th birthday, wonderful human being, was stationed in the Panama Canal Zone and called and asked if I wanted to go to Panama.  I was--this is probably not true.  I say it everywhere, I just don't know the truth though but I said I thought he meant that Panama City, Florida, which I was familiar with 'cause I went there to play high school football.  But I really had no concept of Latin America, Central America and so my sophomore year, I spent there and then I went back to Morehouse and was--had my degree suspended in '69 [1969] because I was involved in the takeover of the university.  This is where I became--
Story_ID: 88972
Speaker 1: --began to become politically, ideologically active and begin to put my anger and my frustration, my social energy into more systemic kinds of frameworks.  You know, Black Power was emerging.  The takeovers in California and then there was Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York] and people like Abdul Alkalimat (Gerald McWorter), who had come out of Fisk People's Institute, something like that, it was called, who was teaching at Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  And he was involved in that takeover.  Vincent Harding [HM] had brought him there in the sociology department.  Then you had A. B. Spellman [HM], you know, who had gone to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] with Amiri Baraka had written a line of notes for a number of [John] Coltrane issues, a poet, a very literate--guy had a house full of books.  These guys were around and times were changing and I began to get some articulation of more canonical, systemic kinds of ideas and ideological points of view.  And it began to bring all of the sort of anti-establishment, individualistic kinds of behavior that I had began to bring into it into some cogency.  And I'd be--that's where my activism, in the (unclear)--you know, I saw people like Bernice Reagon [HM], who was a student at Spelman.  Alice Walker had been there.  I didn't know that.  I didn't know Alice had left and--but I saw the guys standing up against the Vietnam War.  I saw these Jewish professors, I wish I could recall their names now, out in front of Trevor Arnett Library in [Clark] Atlanta University [Atlanta, Georgia], speaking against the Vietnam War and so I was resonating to becoming one of the mediums for what was going on in the world, like many of us, and, but didn't have any idea where that was taking me.  But I was changing and with a sort of intellectual orientation--analytical orientation that had been emerging, you know, since I was probably in the elementary school, from fifth grade on and certainly in high school.
Story_ID: 88973
Speaker 1: It began--I began to channel that in a more focused way and then that radicalism with the takeover of the university [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] and locking up Daddy King [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.] and Judge [Elbert] Tuttle of the Fifth District Court and somebody from the MacGregor Sporting Goods family and Dr. [Benjamin E.] Mays was in that lockup and distinguishing myself for myself from the students who were in the takeover.  I had not been a part of the organizing group.  They had invited me to a meeting the evening before.  I went and stayed at the meeting all of fifteen minutes and then I went to see my main lady friend, who later became my wife, still is my wife after thirty years and the next day when I heard that they had actually taken over the place, I climbed up a tree, went through a second floor window and went in the building and got up there, walked into the conference room where this debate was going on and when I came out of the conference room, some doors had been chained by the students.  And there I was, and because I was independent minded, it was easy for me to find my own voice and perspective; although it was a tense situation.  And so I was with the crowd but I was really not a part of the crowd.  And coming out of that, a group was called--formed--this was SOBU, before SOBU, out of North Carolina, it was called Students Organizing for Black Unity and we met at A. B. Spellman's [HM] house and I was elected chair.  And I remember Abdul Alkalimat said, "We will be watching you," and I said, "And I'll be watching you."  And there I was so I was off into activism.  And we were kicked out of school and--for moral interpitude [sic, turpitude]--I never get the term right but it increased my--almost increased my vocabulary.
Speaker 2: Well, what was the, what was the takeover about.  I mean, what was it actually about, who took over? I mean the students took over the administration?
Speaker 1: The state--students took over and, of course, A. B. Spellman and Abdul Alkalimat, Abdul was really the sort of the pivot, I don't--hesitate to say leader, in many ways he was the leader.  You know, 'cause he was defiant and he was quite articulate, this University of Chicago Ph.D., you know in sociology.  And he took on all these people in the Board of Trustees, anything they said, he could run history around 'em and reference books and what not and firebrand in that regard.  In the takeover, some of the issues were, we wanted, we called for the consolidation of all the schools in the University Center to call it the Martin Luther King University and we had a very material outlook on this, that it would economize, you know, rather than having multiple gyms and, and pools or whatever, student centers.  We wanted more black history courses.  So there were some legitimate things there, black studies courses we wanted.  And what is the term I'm looking for--I've got a cold today and I'm a little tired but the term, amnesty, I'd never heard the term amnesty.  I didn't know what--and at the end, I don't know we were in there two and a half days, three days, we worked out that we would leave and let the people out and then somebody said, what about amnesty.  And I'm thinking what in the hell is amnesty, you know, but as the conversation went on, I realized (laughter) that--but we were summarily tried by university courts and suspended and, I think I was one of one or two seniors.  Sam Jackson talks a lot about this.  I'm not sure that Sam was as actively involved as certainly in my memory as I remember--I know Sam well.  He's an old friend, the big time actor now.
Speaker 2: Samuel L. Jackson? (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Samuel L. Jackson, yeah, he was--he was a year, at least a year behind me but my degree was suspended and the debate was whether or not I would--the degree would be conferred on me.
Story_ID: 88974
Speaker 1: I had finished all of my requirements; although, I forget my major--little Cuban woman, who was my major Spanish teacher.  She called me and she said, Mr. Early, you have to come and take a comprehensive.  They have called me and said that you must take this.  And I went and took this, I don't know four, five hour Spanish comprehensive.  She cried on the phone.  She says, you know, I've always--she was an immigrant, white, small--Avia Nueva was her name; very educated, Cuban woman, probably with very social--narrow social circumstance in Atlanta [Georgia].  It was really not a Latin community.  And she was in this black university complex, like a few of my other major professors in the Spanish department.  And she said, you know I've always thought well of you.  I've always tried to expose you to black themes in Latin American literature and I realized she was trying to justify herself to me.  And I said something to her like, you're absolutely right.  You should feel no--which--but I could--she was feeling a broader social pressure.  And so my degree was suspended and there I was not sure what I want to do.  You know, I've had a beard since I was in high school, I think I cut it once in forty years or something.  I was not gonna go work for IBM.  I mean IBM was down recruiting.  I was just not gonna put on a coat and tie, that was not the stuff I was going to do.  So I hung out around Atlanta, H. Rap Brown Center formed and Sam [Samuel L. Jackson] and all of us were in and around all that.  And I taught night school, Spanish, across town and little odd jobs and what not.  And, but was really living on the margins, no real money.  But got hooked into Charles Frainey (ph.), now deceased, died of AIDS, who was a nephew, I think, of Vincent Harding's [HM] wife, very bright guy, came out of SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee], Civil Rights Movement, asked me to come down to the Martin--to the--into the denominational seminary [Interdenominational Theological Seminar, Atlanta, Georgia] where the Martin Luther King Project was going on.  And I went down there, got a job as an archivist.  I mean (laughter)--processing papers.  So I was going through all of these documents from SNCC from Lowndes County and all those kinds of places and reading these names and reading these circulars and what not and Bernice Reagon's [HM], who was wheelchair bound, who died, extraordinarily strong person, who Bernice was very close too, that took me another--took me into an intellectual, academic arena with activism and purpose.  And so I was taking another step.  Vincent Harding then, who had also set up the Institute of the Black World asked me to apply for a Southern Education Foundation Fellowship.  Bernice Reagon and I both got Southern Foundation Fellowships.  I went to the Institute of the Black World.  I had written something about the uses the Spanish language and black community development or something.  I can't remember what the--but I went up and I worked as Vincent's AA for a short time but then that was around I met Lerone Bennett [HM]. I met Arna Bontemps.  I met C.L.R. James, Joyce Ladner [HM], Bobby [Robert] Hill, who has now become the foremost [Marcus] Garvey scholar. [William] Bill Strickland, the political scientist and [Chester] Chet Davis, who was in education and later Howard Dodson [HM] and all of these folk.  And then I met Harry Haywood, who had brought the negro national question back from--I'll never forget--the 23rd something, 28th common term (unclear), who knew Lenin.  Vincent Harding had found him down in Mexico.  And later years, I met Elizabeth Catlett [HM], and I asked her an ideological question, I said, do you know Harry Haywood?  That was my way of telling her who I was and then trying to figure out if I had really grasped something in her beyond being a great artist.  She looked at me.  She says I'm the one who told Harry Haywood that he had been expelled from the Communist Party.  Harry was a communist.  I was intrigued by this.  I was then beginning to read Mao Tse-tung from the bookshelf of Bill Strickland and with--when Harry came, my, she was not my wife, my girlfriend, Miriam Stewart-Early, whose father was a Congressman, a Daley-ite, who had been put into office when Metcalfe died.  Ralph Jr. and Miriam grew up together but Metcalfe was a more independent minded black politician.  My father [in law] was a party politician, wonderful man but did not see the coming change and but still a very sound social man.  In the event--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: His name is Stewart?
Speaker 1: Are you?  Yeah, Stuart, Bennett Stewart--(simultaneous)--I forget his ward--30s--I forget which ward it was. Twenty-second ward or something like that--I can't--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Okay.  And Barbara Holt is my ex-sister in law, who then became in Hyde Park became a city council person.  Her daughters are brilliant, brilliant daughters; are really, really still close to us.  One is University of Chicago, teaching film and literature and got the most office--tenured office when she came out of grad school than anybody in the country that year.  And other daughter is here at University of Maryland working on her PhD but that's sort of jumping ahead of the historical line.  So around Harry Haywood, you know, Harry would ask me all of these questions about the student movement.  What are students thinking and my anti-establishment, counter culture now was beginning to take on a more formal ideological trip.  I was moving towards thinking about socialism, communism didn't--and reading Mao Tse-tong and Marxism and not sure what it all meant, where I was going but it took me on later into the new communist movement.
Story_ID: 88975
Speaker 1: Now I had a job all this time.  Or, I was in graduate school raising a family and working jobs, National Endowment for the Humanities, Smithsonian, so forth and so on.  But I had learned to bring alive--I learned to live in the public space and I'd learned to bring all of my little dabblings into pre-transparent space.  And so it took me into a more formal left ideological outlook and it still informs a lot of who I am today and how I carry myself.  I can't say that it's given me total stability because--particularly in these times but that, that was a transitional moment.  Vincent [Harding, HM] suggested--I guess it was Vincent who, you know, I'd been around these activist intellectuals and I began to see all the possibilities for this sort of undisciplined, unformed intellectual dimension of myself, of not just being a teacher but you could be socially concerned and bring it to something beyond just having a head full of knowledge.  You know the Institute of the Black World was an extraordinary concept.  And these people were really concerned about community development and the like and somehow through Vincent, I ended up applying for Ford Foundation Fellowship; so did Bernice Reagon [HM].  I went to New York in the interview and a woman--her name escapes me now.  She's one of the first black political scientists PhD.  She was at Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia], retired from Spelman recently.  They said well, if you get this fellowship, where would you go to work on your PhD and I didn't have the foggiest idea.  I said Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  And one of the black men, who I should remember, but I don't now, she said, does Howard have a PhD program and before I could say anything, 'cause I didn't know what to say, this guy said yes, they got one a year ago or two years ago or something.  So I come back from New York, thinking I'll never get this fellowship.  I get contacted, you have a fellowship, a five year fellowship, all paid expenses to work on a PhD.  I had not applied anywhere.  This was some time in the middle of the summer so it was time to go off to university (laughter).  Vincent called Howard, Lorraine Williams, the late Lorraine Williams, who was head of the history department, said I got this student, he's got a Ford Foundation Fellowship, I was admitted to Howard.  And it was very interesting because that summer, leaving Atlanta, Bernice Reagon, me, the late Stephen Henderson, who was a brilliant literary scholar; Andrew Billingsley, who had just left Berkley and stopped in Atlanta and was gonna be working at the Institute of the Black World was called by [James] Cheek [GM] to come and be Vice President of Academic Affairs.  Joyce Ladner [HM] who had been one of the founding fellows of Institute of the Black World.  We all moved to Washington, D.C. probably that August, now thirty-two years ago.
Story_ID: 88976
Speaker 1: And that was another step.  Here in a big city, I'd never seen row house, you know, my saying begin, in the south no matter how poor or rich you were, you always had a front yard, a back yard and a side yard (laughter), you know.  Although I had lived in Polkinghorne Village which were these World War II barracks but I had never seen people living right up on the street.  Just the whole physical environment was somewhat disconcerting for me.  And went to Howard University [Washington, D.C.] and I met Sterling Brown, [E.] Ethelbert Miller [HM], now well-known writer, poet, critic.  I think he was the first one to take me to hear Sterling Brown.  I don't know that I was aware of Sterling before, I may have been but when I heard him read, it took me to Dunnellon, Florida.  You know, butter beans, (unclear) and for the little fellow, running space, you know, and those portraits.  He was a portraiture poet.  And, in addition to being wonderful poetic phrasing, the imagery, I knew the barber shop, you know, the hipsters.  You know, walking down U Street.  I knew this from Washington Street, you know; or the bars, the dirt bars with the hewn  wooden bars in Dunnellon, Florida, where you'd walk in and it'd be, the floor would be dirt and everything else was hand--so all the things began to gel for me. John Killens, I met John Killens and ended up working with him.  The writer's conferences when I was working at the Institute for the Arts and Humanities with Steve Henderson, you know, Amiri Baraka.  When Ngaki NShanga (ph.) came and all these guys were coming down on her and I saw this girl walking with a rose in her hair and chewing chewing gum and I heard her speak and I said, wow, this girl can write.  All of those years began to just come together.  And--
Story_ID: 88977
Speaker 1: My freshman--my first year at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] and, of course on Puerto Rican history, Maria Brau who is the great granddaughter, I think, of the father of Puerto Rican history, Salvador Brau, pretty conservative guy.  I was again out-spoken and she was--said something in the classroom and I took issue with.  And she said, well, for the paper that you have to write here in this class, you'll probably be interested in writing on Don Pedro Alviso Campos and his black shirts.  I thought black shirts was a reference to it, sort of a black nationalist.  She was making a reference to Mussolini's fascism.  Being a Spanish speaker, you know, a lot of my references from my graduate school papers, I would--I began to do translation.  And most students, I don't think any other students were doing that.  And I became interested in the Puerto Rican movement and I began to understand Puerto Rico as a colony and joined the Puerto Rican Solidarity Committee, became its leader two or three times here in D.C.  Ended up in Cuba for the first international conference in support of the independence of Puerto Rico, with people from the communist party and ex members of the communist part, Arthur Connoy (ph.), Irwin Silber who was editor of "The Guardian" newspaper in New York; and Margaret Burroughs [HM], very close out of Chicago and Grace Mora, head of the Puerto Rican Commission of the Communist Party and Doron Weinberg who was the new head of the National Lawyer's Guild at the time.  This is a--big step--forward and really out into the world.  And we were then expecting our first child and I'm in graduate school and I'm dealing with left hot political issues.  I'm head of the graduate student council at Howard.  I'm very much involved in politics.  I'm sort of again dabbling in a lot of things.  And I stay there five years but I didn't have the discipline.  I was being patted on the head as a very bright young man but I did not know how to say what I didn't know but I knew there was much I did know.  I didn't have anyone who really took me by the neck and said, you know, you got some possibilities but you're far from being a finished product and if you don't get your but to work.  And then to show how to work, but I didn't know how to liberate myself and say I don't understand this.  I'd never learned to write.  And so today, writing is the hardest thing and people say well, you speak so well, you could--and the few things that I do get written, people enjoy.  But it's just, I don't have the discipline.  I don't.  And so I finally decided I'm giving up this graduate school.  Ford Foundation wrote me and said, we see that you haven't finished your work.  We're prepared to give you more money.  I balled the letter up and shot it into the trash can.
Story_ID: 88978
Speaker 1: And I said to myself, I'm gonna go out and make a little light reputation for myself.  By that time, I realized I had some currency in broader circles.  I was--I had, I hung out with a lot of artists, Jeff Donaldson [HM] and Frank Smith [HM], people who had come out of the AfriCOBRA School, out of Chicago.  They were all at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  I'd met them earlier in Atlanta.  I felt at ease with these guys even though I was much younger but the age difference begins to close 'cause I was now in--I'd stepped into their arena.  I was no longer a youngster outside of their arena.  Spent a lot of time learning Portuguese, got hooked into the Smithsonian, got married.  Smithsonian met me and--Guyana, South America on my honeymoon which my wife calls a field trip for the--at the first Cara Festa (ph.); me and Bernice Reagon and the late Gerald Davis.  We met Forbes Burnham and another step in politics and interests.  And the Smithsonian asked me when I came back if I would--Bernice said they want to talk to you about doing some work.  And as a graduate student, I met with them and Bernice and Gerald Davis said I have this project called the African Diaspora.  I had not the foggiest idea what the term diaspora mean.  I didn't know that the term was generally attached to the Jewish diaspora at the time--I didn't--but the more he talked and I began to realize that it was the spread of people and who had some kind of connection to Africa and he says, we want you to go to Brazil a year from now.  And I was stunned.  I immediately went on took a course in Portuguese at Howard 'cause I had to do a second language as a graduate student.  I picked up Portuguese like that because my Spanish background; took a high level course for something four, five weeks that summer at Georgetown's Foreign Language School.  And the next thing I know, I'm off to Latin America.
Story_ID: 91198
Speaker 1: You know, so Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] was rich.  I should mention Rayford Logan who I took five courses from.  He's a brilliant man.  Spoke Spanish, French, studied Latin, taught Spanish and French and who called himself a negro.  And refused to let us use the term black in his class.  And I remember Bernice Reagon [HM] and I would often use the term black and I would try to talk to him about Stokely Carmichael's philosophical treatise on the meaning of blackness.  And he left the room on one occasion, Bernice was speaking and I remember one graduate student said to me, he's gonna flunk you guys.  And I said no, he may flunk you guys but the fact that he didn't put us out of his class (laughter).  He sees something in us and he's trying to get through to us and--but studying with classical historian like that and watching h ow meticulous he was.  And I--we stayed good friends 'til his death.  I learned a lot, didn't change my ideological outlook but it helped me in my maturity about living in the public space, not on the rhetorical margins.  Although most of my political colleagues, ideological colleagues were all--were coming from the margins, angling towards the mainstream but I was already in the mainstream, trying to development roots in the left.  But I had a family and--so all of these people--I'm trying to think of the author's name, the Destruction of Black Civilization, Chancellor Williams.  I took courses from Chancellor Williams and my Professor Vincent Peloso, my main professor and I--Bernice Reagon and I led the charge on getting away from these three hour courses in graduate school and having some reading courses and I read the first volume of Capital with my major professor, Vincent Peloso, who would close the door.  And one day, Lorraine Williams stopped me in the hall, she says tell Vincent I know what you all are reading. And--
Story_ID: 91199
Speaker 1: So I was, you know, I was expanding and meeting all these writers and stimulated. Haki Madhubuti [HM], we lived in the same, in Harvard Hall.  I was a graduate student.  He, he'd come in from Chicago.  In my--Haki always showed a very strong interest in me and I--my own thinking, we never really talked about it was that his--he saw my language abilities, some of my worldliness and he admired that I thought.  And I felt like we are so different and I was so reticent to engage him because I was a Marxist, he was a nationalist.  And when he wrote, I forget the name of this book, and he has--I don't know--almost a hundred people listed in the opening pages.  And I saw my name in there, I felt like, boy, there's an issue of maturity here that I have not grasped.  We are different but there is not the divide.  I was respectful of him, I did not want to engage him in battle, nor did I want to become too close to him.  I just didn't know how to, how to negotiate that.  And he's somebody I have a lot of respect for.  I've grown to have more respect for him 'cause I--a lot of things now I understand that I did not understand.  I'm--we pretty much probably have different outlooks but it would not stop us from doing a lot of joint work together and a lot of respect but; and I've seen he and [Amiri] Baraka in the (unclear) between them and many ways, I think Haki's maturity was more advance than Baraka's.  He was the one who set the basis for them to define (unclear) later.  He published in the last four, five years one of Baraka's works and--but with John Killens and knowing his background and, you know, meeting people like Elizabeth Catlett [HM]. And--
Story_ID: 91200
Speaker 1: So my education was still very eclectic and very much outside of formal grounds and, you know, Bernice Reagon [HM] has played a very and (unclear) has played a very important role in my life.  No question about that.  I was in a sense star struck because we were undergraduates together and this woman with this thick head of wooly afro hair as she would stride purposely across campus, probably going back to take care of her children, people would whisper, see that woman there, she's been in jail.  Well, I had not come out of the Civil Rights Movement. It was--didn't come out of the black church.  I didn't so I didn't have that kind of formation.  I had not been involved in those demonstrations.  And I had had this sort of insular, almost cocoon background growing up on a black college campus that was sort of insular and protective in itself.  And when she asked me when I was working at the Martin Luther King Documentation Center and I guess I'd been out of school about a year and a half, if I would tape record a black songwriter's conference that she was doing.  It was these big 'ole clunky tape recorders of the time, the uhers, I think, which was the tape recorder, that German but it was like a thousand pounds, it felt like, you know when you look at today's technology.  And I sat for at least two days, maybe three.  I had no conception of a black songwriter's gathering.  And I heard her with all of the singers.  I wish I could remember this guy's name who came out of the Civil Rights Movement, a singer.  But anyway, I've developed a relationship with her and we came to graduate school together and I always had a sense that we were seen as two kids from the south.  I've never really talked to her about this.  I've felt there was a kind of maternal sense that Lorraine Williams had that she had to help and protect us.  Now Bernice had been in and out of jail, gone to college when she was sixteen, terrific history of organizing, activism and while I had not come from the same background, I was quite capable and independent.  When I got married my second year in graduate school and I came back with my wife from Chicago, Bernice gave a house warming reception.  She was living in southeast Washington.  And I asked my wife why do you think Bernice is doing this for us.  And she says Bernice really likes you.  So I had this star kind of look at her.  We had a friendship but I felt I was not in her class.  In many ways today I still feel I am not in her class.  She's really a tremendous weight in world culture, not just as an individual 'cause she's a very social person.  But over the years, with my wife's articulation, I began to realize that Bernice saw something in me and in our friendship.  And I, you know, I always saw something in her and we've had a very strong counsel, where we serve as each other's counsel over the years and helped each other raise our children and gone through the trials and tribulations of our relationships with our significant others and our children and what not.  And I've always seen her walk into the wind, walk against the grain.  Often I've felt this girl doesn't have the foggiest idea what it's going to take to get this done.  But she knows it's gotta be dealt with and she's gonna learn--and I've learned that my sense is she learns in the process.  She finds what it is.  And so she's been a tremendous inspiration for me, you know, she's religious.  I'm not, you know, she's a pacifist, I guess, in a manner of speaking, I'm not.  But, she's been a--a kind of touch stone.
Story_ID: 91201
Speaker 1: And I've met a lot of giants that I've learned from and have admired being around and, you know, I've had some friends who say, well you know you're a name dropper.  I am.  I, I, this rich body of people I went at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] at a time that there was still an extraordinary grouping of black people, Leon Gontran Damas, one of the three major figures of Negritude, you know, became very close to him. Sterling Brown, you know, Dorothy Porter and I said, why wouldn't, I mean I recognize that this was--this was the university and it's informal setting and in many ways, I still seek, you know, out those kinds of relationships. And--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that certainly (unclear).  It was the heyday of Howard in a lot of ways.  The personalities and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: The issues being raised and the whole style of what was going at Howard in those days was really exciting.  You had a radio show at Howard.  You were on WHUR.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Which is--WHUR itself is a--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: It was the bomb then, as the kids say.  Yeah, 360 degrees of blackness.  It was a great experiment with a lot of visionary underpinnings and a lot of creative people.  Kojo N'Namdi [HM], who is now big time journalist, came out of there.  Sandra Rattley out of that news collector went on to become, I think, at one point one of the vice presidents of NPR [National Public Radio].  [E.] Ethelbert Miller [HM], I think was a person who started me in radio and invited in by Niani Kilkenny, who works here at the Smithsonian.  And they said Early, why don't you come do a radio program and Ethelbert had been bringing me in interviews.  We did three part series with Amiri Baraka, from Leroy Jones to Amiri Baraka, the motion of history took his two names and one of his books called the motion of history and that's on tape somewhere that I hope will get transcribed when I was asking him about dialects and poetry as I recall.  I think the first major thing we did was a birthday celebration to Sterling Brown was an all day.  We put all these jazz recordings and blues recordings together and a lot of interviews with A. B. Spellman [HM], a lot of people.  And then I was asked if I would do a program.  And by this time, by this time, I had probably gone into what was beginning to be called the new communist movement. And I forget some of the earlier formations, but later the organization that I--involved in--that I was involved in was called the line of march and had a newspaper called front line newspaper.  And, so my ideological formation now was pretty close construct of how the world should look and what we should be striving for.  And so they said, well, these programs need to be short.  And I said, well, I'll take the last ten minutes of this two hour magazine and they said, well, what are you gonna call it?  And I ended up calling it "Ten Minutes Left".
Story_ID: 91202
Speaker 1: So it was a double entendre.  It was ideologically and thematically left.  And it was literally the last ten minutes.  And I had a concept that I was going to take these left terms like socialism, communism and put it on popular, accessible language by bringing recognized experts, whether by name or by degree, like Dr. Hilbourne Watson.  Let's talk about constructs of democracy, western constructs.  Is there something called socialist democracy?  And I had--because I dialogue with myself all the time, I had this dialogue in my mind about what an audience would be hearing.  I didn't want to sloganeer.  I wanted them to get the narrative content of terms and then--but I wanted to use the terms and so that, but it was really getting at the stuff, the meaning of them.  And years later, when I was being interviewed for an unsolicited fellowship, the U.S. Japan Society, somebody had recommended me.  The guy walked in, he said the first thing he said to me, says 10 minutes left.  And I think oh, 'cause it's on my resume.  I said, he went right to it.  He's trying to figure out.  And I said yeah, you know the first program that I did on AIDS and I just was now I didn't say that AIDS was a left issue but I was giving him a content sense.  I said, you know I was really concerned AIDS was a gay man's disease.  And when I heard about AIDS, you know, it was mysterious.  People saying, what are people talking about?  And I don't how people feel about SARS today in, I mean, I guess we are so now used to contemporary epidemics, health epidemics and the like but AIDS was mysterious and then it had this stigma of being gay men and then here I am a straight man.  What am I doing talking about--this is in the early stages before we knew the broader socio implications of AIDS.  But I thought you always like to go against the grain.  This is--people in your broader community of interest that you're friends with or raising this, you gotta speak to it and no matter what people may think, why is James Early interested?  That's how narrow my conception was.  And that was my own identity--that was also my homophobia.  Although I'd raised my kids to be open with gay and lesbian people 'cause they were through our house, many of our closest friends, even some family members.  And we talked about it. So in one sense, we were raising our children to be the selves that almost we weren't or perhaps would never really fully be.  And so it seems like a paradox.  So I said to him, I gave him that--my--as the example of left, that was--'cause I didn't want to get into socialism and communism.  But I did programs like what is news.  I think today with this crisis and monopoly media and what not, I was talking to a congressman on the hill today about this issue.  And talked to Bob McChesney today--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Now are we talking about the early '80s [1980]?
Speaker 1: We're talking about the early '80s [1980], yes.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I know AIDS didn't hit 'til '81 [1981], '82 [1982].
Story_ID: 91203
Speaker 1: And this program ran for five years and I would sometimes do like three part series. And occasionally, I mean, as you can see, I can talk forever so occasionally I could talk for ten minutes but I had to figure out how to do that so that it wasn't about me.  It was about the issue.  But the part that was about me was ok, I thought of this but I also had to think about the, the radio quality.  I had been aware for a long time of my speaking voice and how people respond to that.  So there were, there were certain issues of presentation that I did have to really think in a personal way about.  But content-wise, I was trying to open people's minds up.  And I--it's a program I'm very proud of.  I've had people from USAID  [United States Agency for International Development] and other mainstream institutions who, in later years, I would meet.  They would say, oh, James Early, don't I know your name?  And I had one guy who said, you know, I used to make sure that I left the golf course in time on Sunday that I was either home or at least in my car to hear your program.  And I'm thinking, this is a guy working with US government and--but then I began to realize something that was probably a part of my early--conceptual approach to this anyway.  And it certainly something of premise I work from today.  There are many people who have expanded democratic views, radical, democratic views who are working in mainstream institutions and positions who use mainstream language and carry themselves, their decorum is a small "c" conservative; not ideological but sort of status quo.  They do think out of the box.  They have feelings out of the box.  They have not learned themselves or found a way to do that.  I've been lucky, fortunate up to this point and I'm always looking over my shoulder, I've been able to maintain those two.  And so that I was a reference for their own, for the internal selves, not just, I was not trying to be a radio personality or a star or something.  That's not where my head has ever been.  Although I--you know the older I become more comfortable that people do acknowledge you.  I've even become comfortable with people that acknowledge you for things that you actually have nothing to do with; and, at a certain point, you just can't explain to everybody you meet that (laughter), that is not who I am.  You just sometimes have to let people have their concept of you; although it's not your concept of yourself.  And, but yeah, I did that radio program and it's one of the most important discipline things that I did 'cause radio is--it is demanding.  You know you have to find the people and Howard [WHUR-FM] was not a station that had a lot of aids around who could help you; and, you know, getting guests there and if your guests, you know, you haven't done your homework and have somebody waiting in the wings but I did it for five years.  And I would love to go back to radio but I travel too much and I love traveling too much now to discipline myself to do it.
Speaker 2: Was your show going on when Paul Brock [HM] was there?
Speaker 1: You know, I don't know.  And I know his name and I'm just--I don't know--I just don't know.  Kojo N'Namdi [HM] was there the whole time and he's probably the--along with Kathy Liggins [Hughes, HM].  I'm trying to see, if my show was even going on, I think still when Kathy Liggins was--the latter years when Kathy Liggins was around WHUR before she became the big time black radio mogul that she is today whose taken all of the news off of her stations by and large, you know.  And, so, you know, we got racial democratic equality for the same garbage in many instances that we've criticized the quote unquote white mainstream media.  So that the value issue which is bigger than just being black or woman or Hispanic or Jewish or whatever the, the issue of marginalization or discrimination is, what's your forward thinking value?  But, yeah Kojo and Kathy are probably the two people who have emerged as the big time media entities coming out of that.
Speaker 2: Okay.  How long did your show last?
Speaker 1: Five years.
Speaker 2: Okay, 'til about--?
Speaker 1: Oooh man, I'm so bad on the actual historical chronology--I just--I don't even remember anymore.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I have some of the tapes at home, so one of my former undergraduate assistants, who was out in Houston, she wanted to do something--she wanted to do 10 minutes left on a station, public station, she was working out of there.  She went and made some tapes for me and so I had--and the rest of them are rotting in my garage on those bigger reels, that I just haven't had the proper self-reflection, I guess, or ego to take care of them.
Speaker 2: Now--
Story_ID: 91204
Speaker 1: What--well, tell me about finishing your PhD at--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, I, I, I, first of all, I failed my comprehensives.  I took my comprehensives when my major professor was on leave in Peru and people said you were stupid.  I mean, I was, I was not focused on graduate school [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  In some ways, I was going through the motions.  I had a great time as I had had at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  I was learning a lot but I, I did not have any real direction and I was frightened.  I did not know how to say, I need help in learning to write.  I had, as I often have, I had an idealistic sense of what history is.  That, that was some pure formula that I had not figured out.  Rather than that, there are multiple ways of writing history.  I didn't understand that I did not want to--first of all, I didn't, I don't think I wanted to be a historian.  But I hadn't figured that out.  I did not under--know the terminology of a culture--I mean as bright as I was and as far ranging as I was, it was just a lot of things that I was pretty primitive about.  I did not know the construct of cultural historian, of which would have really given me an entree to something that I was blossoming into.  I was working in culture.  I just happened to be working in it.  I didn't--I hadn't been trained for it per se because this is a part of--this is under the downside of being a dabbler and eclectic is you find yourself in all kinds of ways.  Now I realize that a lot of people do that and then they have a sense of self concept that they become experts in the field.  I'm invited to come to Uruguay in November to do something on black dance.  I'm saying I don't--dance is not my arena.  They really--these people know me.  They respect who I am.  They want me to help 'em find the people but I'm saying, that's not fair to the discipline (laughter) to--I will probably go in any event 'cause I'm gonna get them some good people and I'm not gonna try to be a principle.  But a lot of people make their reputation.  People recognize you and then they say yes, that's who I am.  People would acknowledge me and I would say to myself, that's not who you are.  I have a moral sense.  I've not done the homework.  I've not the leg-work.  I've not done the woodshedding.  And so my wife tells me, I'm the most insecure person she knows and that is true.  I have a great, deep dimension of insecurity, even as I'm a very confident person in public.  So I came to a point--I just got so frustrated, I couldn't figure out--I knew I don't want to do this  I don't want to be disciplined to do this.  I want to get out of this.  And then I made a decision, I'm going to work and because almost--certainly ironically I recognized you do have some marketplace currency, not just in terms of getting a job but in also being recognized.  Because I think I'd like being acknowledged. I mean, I think if you are a historian, a poet, a writer, an actor, this is not just self-indulgence.  We are social beings (laughter).  We want somebody to help validate that yes, this is worth it all.
Story_ID: 91205
Speaker 1: And by that time I had figured out, I was saying to my wife just recently, I said, boy, we were a pretty and handsome couple hanging out with, you know, the AfriCOBRA  people and the late Scunda (ph.) Bogosian and around A. B. Spellman [HM] and all of these people and now I can reflect--they saw something in us that we didn't fully see in ourselves but we were confident to put ourselves in that position and so in that regard, I'm still on a, a maturation track that is much younger than my fifty-six years.  In many ways, I'm older than my fifty-six years but I am much younger and unconstructed in some ways.  Like writing, you know, my children started writing because we got--particularly of our youngest child.  You know, he went to Duke at thirteen, take a writer's course, start writing for "Black Sisters and Brothers" magazine, BET [Black Entertainment Television].  He would write his stuff, put it on the fax machine, send it over to BET.  They would mark it up and send it back.  He would change certain things and he'd say but I ain't changing this.  He'd write his editor, I'm keeping this and I thought, wow, for somebody--today's stuff that I--the few things that I've published, it may be months before I read it because I realize I haven't lived with it long enough.  I'll find a sentence or thought and that's--because then you get an idealism that keeps you--say well--so I just came to this point in graduate school, I said I have to--this is not what I'm going to become.  And I am so pleased that I am not off (laughter) in a graduate school teaching as the only thing that I do.  I love engaging students and I've had the experience of going--I was at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.]--just got something today on my email from a young woman doing a Master's degree at NYU [New York University, New York City, New York], Melissa Valle.  And she says I just saw this, got this email of an educational tour to Cuba, December, 2003.  And she says I know this guy, James Early and I told my friend, you know what, this was my professor.  He was a great professor.  I just wrote her back sort of thanking.  So I've--that's why I left.  I was not sure where I wanted to go.
Story_ID: 91206
Speaker 1: Okay, so you didn't, you didn't--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I didn't finish and so people say you're A-B-D and I say no, I'm a drop out.  And, you know, I do a lot of speaking and everywhere I go, universities and what not.  People said and Dr. James Early and I say, my mother must have called you and said if you call him Dr. James Early, maybe he'll go back and finish his PhD.  My sons are both on my case about finishing the doctorate and writing a book.  I don't think I'll ever write a book.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  Dr. James Early, right.  I-every--after all, I work at the Smithsonian Institution, I got this big title, I've had some significant titles and significant institutions and I very much am a part--I exude the culture and the posture of an academic.  That's a part of my (laughter) eclectic background.  And, so I, I, I was, I've actually been asked one of my fellow graduate students, she's now head of graduate studies in History Department Howard.  She approached me about two years ago.  She called me.  She said, I'd like for you--she was at least a year behind me.  She's got her PhD.  She says I'd like for you to come back to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  Let's go over your transcript.  You wouldn't have to do very much.  And do the PhD and I said no, I just, I can't.  I just, I still don't have that discipline, that focus.  I have that laziness and that insecurity and, you know, I'm productive but I'm not nearly as productive as I might be.  So I, these are the contradictions that I live with and--
Speaker 1: There are--let me just offer this. That there are people that have PhDs, that when--I'm sure you've run across people that have them, that you wonder, you know, you wonder about the depth of their real knowledge or--
Speaker 2: I agree.
Speaker 1: (Unclear), (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: You're absolutely right.  You're absolutely right.
Speaker 1: What are they really PhD of, you know, when it's all said and done, you know?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I think part of psychologically what I struggle with and I increasingly talk about these things in the public 'cause I think it's particularly helpful for younger adults trying to find their way is, you know, a lot of us have made careers out of being radicals, almost cottage industry, you know.  We--if-if the-if the majority of the people are for it, we'll find a reason to be, to be against it, you know.  I'm interested in transformation, not just critique.  That's something I talked to--again young people all the time.  What is to be done?  I know how bad it is and I agree with your articulation of how bad it is but what are we going to do about it?  What are we doing about it?  And how can we turn it--my own created metaphors, how can we turn that little pinhead of a light into a full sky.  That's what I'm interested in doing.  At the same time, I've also come to say over the years that I don't want to live twenty-four hours a day being radical.  It takes a great deal out of you.  In other words, I would like to have some standards, some normative things that I agree with.  So, you know, now my wife joined the church.  She grew up in the church but she joined the church in our neighborhood.  I happened to be in South Africa at the World Conference Against Racism when this black woman, pastor, who's one of the pastors in that church, who had called that day and talked to the main pastor of what was going to church.  She says, guess what?  I said what?  She says Miriam joined the church.  And I felt like, wow.  Six months my, our youngest son applying to Sarah Lawrence [College, Yonkers, New York] writing his essay says as the son of a Marxist father and a Christian mother and I'm thinking, his Marxist father is all over the map.  His Christian mother has been the anchor for the family.  She's got some stableness and so my point here is every--I think it's healthy to have reference points, social reference points.  And so often, at least of the radical community that I've come out of because there is no real consolidated organization--groups of organizations and they all broke up.  It leaves you very unstable and it can leave you in some ways lonely and indecisive and insecure and unsure.  And so that's sort of where I am about these issues of degrees and what not.  And, you know, I make more money than the average PhD, black, white, green.  I've been fortunate and/or skilled, probably a little of both.  And I just don't see any practical reason for going back to do it now.  And I'm too lazy to get down to--you have to work.  I mean you have discipline--to discipline yourself to do that.  It's like teaching.  I love teaching and would do it at any moment but you go in that classroom if you're serious.  You have to be prepared.  You know, there's a way that you can bullshit students, easily.  But if you're serious about teaching, you gotta read the material yourself, you know.  You gotta be able to help them find avenues and that's hard work.  That work I'm willing to do but the rest of it, I just--I don't have any interest at this point.
Story_ID: 88988
Speaker 1: Alright.  How did you get involved in the Smithsonian?
Speaker 2: Well, it was actually on my honeymoon.  My wife would kill me, I been married thirty-two years, whatever that is from this year.  It was the C.A.R.I.F.E.S.T.A. [Caribbean Festival of the Arts].  I was a graduate student.  I worked out that I could get some money as a graduate student to go to Guyana, South America.  For the first C.A.R.I.F.E.S.T.A. and we were married in, I think August 12th, I think it was.  Yes, it was August 12th.  And we went down to Guyana and the Cubans who were participating in this festival and, of course, ideologically I was drawn to the Cubans.  The Cuban Revolution and then the strong African diaspora presence in Cuba and the music and all.  So I would go out a number of afternoons while we were there to this place that had been built, housing had been constructed, practicing my Spanish.  My wife says it was a field trip, not a honeymoon.  And someone from the Smithsonian, Bernice Reagon was there, as a graduate student.  Gerald, the late Gerald Davis, who was then graduate student at Rutgers in folklore and was actually a deputy director at the Smithsonian Office of Folklife Programs. And when I came back, Bernice mentioned to me that they were interested in talking to me about doing some work here and I came down and he talked to me about the African Diaspora and my relationship started.  I started doing field research in Latin America.
Story_ID: 88989
Speaker 1: The first trip was to Brazil.  And because I, as a young person, didn't know when I'd ever get a chance to leave the country again, although I had studied out of the country one year before, just shows you how narrow your perspective could be, I arranged for them to have my trip to leave here.  I went to Venezuela, Peru, Chile, Uruguay, Argentina.  I was supposed to go to Bolivia but I skipped Bolivia.  Then in to, to Rio [de Janeiro], Brazil and I was headed to Bahia, Salvador.  And then to Pernambuco, in the northeastern part of Brazil.  And then I was supposed to go to French Guyana but I skipped French Guiana unfortunately and I've never been there.  And then I went to--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--did you go Bahia [Brazil]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I went to Bahia.  I spent almost, maybe three weeks.  And--
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--
Speaker 1: And then I went to Pernambuco for about a week and then I went to Trinidad and from Trinidad, I was on my way to Puerto Rico but people who were involved with the New J.E.W.E.L. [Joint Endeavor for Welfare, Education, and Liberation] Movement and who, who were also involved with C. L. R. James, that I knew from graduate school talked me into stopping in Barbados to deliver a letter.  Today, I would be suspected of terrorism or something.  So I met this lawyer in Barbados for two or three hours and delivered this letter and then went on to Puerto Rico and back to the States.  And from there, my involvement with the Smithsonian continued.  I began to do researching a number of places.  I wanted to go to Cuba but, of course, they wouldn't let us go to Cuba so I started working with the Cuban community in New York for Folklife--researching Folklife Festivals and did work in Jamaica and other places.  And we produced a number of festivals leading up to the bicentennial.  That's what we were doing.  We started our first festival probably '73 [1973]  Bicentennial was '76 [1976].  And Bernice [Reagon] directed it and Rosie Hooks who was, until recently was married to Bobbie Hooks.
Speaker 2: The actor Robert Hooks (Unclear)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, the actor, Robert Hooks [HM] and, of course, Bernice was around The Last Colony Theater which Bobbie Hooks had founded and that's how, that's where Sweet Honey In the Rock was formed, out of that.  And then I gave--as it turns out, I gave Sweet Honey their first job, that's sort of a tangent.  I didn't know that 'til they wrote their book and said James Early.  Actually Steve Henderson and I and--which is another story--but that's how I got involved with the Smithsonian.
Story_ID: 88990
Speaker 1: And then Ralph Rinzler, who had been brought from the Newport Folk Festival to do some work with the [Smithsonian] Folklife Festival starting in '67 [1967], long before I got here though Bernice [Reagon, HM] had been involved with them.  Despite the fact that we had had a falling out, he, Bernice and I were in issue.  Bernice, at that point, when we walked out of the meetings said that, he'll call us some years from now to work with him again and sure as life, he did.  I was working at the National Endowment for the Humanities and he called me and he said that he was going to become an assistant secretary for public service at the Smithsonian and what he said to me quote was I need a deputy, someone who is ideological.  Took him a year to work it out.  By that time, I really had to get out of the endowment.  I was, I'd been fighting so much and so hard against Bill Bennett and the right wing drift there, that it was just taking my spirit.  I was angry all the time and anxious all the time and, but feeling like I had to fight for principles, of helping people getting funded so I couldn't become quiet.  And just a bad situation to be in and so I came here as his deputy.  And, came here to do some fighting, but it was a fresh front and I was brought here to really take on issues.  We developed the Cultural Education Committee to really democratize the place.  We went through all of the museums, took on all of the directors about their, what was in their collection, who was on their staff and our principle was you have to have a diverse group of people at policy making decisions.  And then later as Ralph became ill and began to move away from his ability to do work at institution, I became the acting assistant secretary.  (Coughing)--excuse me.  And did that for a number of years until the new administration came in and turned us out and (coughing), and then I was sort put out to pasture. The other assistant secretaries who were sort of forced out (coughing) are let go in the institution.  I'm gonna have to take a break (coughing).
Speaker 2: [OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION]
Speaker 1: So I had become an assistant secretary in my forties, I guess, somewhat of a young age.  And because--I'd like to think because of the work that I'd done, it was really hard to just get rid of me.  Plus I'm a federal employee and that's always hard to get people out of federal government.
Story_ID: 88991
Speaker 1: So [Constance] Connie Newman [HM] who was the under-secretary in--said to me, you know, you should decide where you want to go.  And I decided I wanted to come back where I'd started at Folklife because this was also the most dynamic democratic, radical space, with Folk race records Pete Seeger, Bernice Reagon [HM], that kind of tradition.  And tied into communities, living culture, not just artifacts so this was a good place for me to come.  And plus I had hired the director here and knew the staff well and familiar with the place and so I came over here.  And I went through a, a really difficult period because, you know, I think like most men socialize in all societies but certainly this one.  I did not know how to say that I was hurting.  You know to have your job taken from you, to be removed from a staff and resources.  And we had a lot of things done, you know, we set up the Latino working group, which later became the Latino Center, a black American with a white American assistant, east Indian assistant, a really multi-cultural group.  We set up the Martin Luther King lecture series here at the Smithsonian that Ralph Rinzler proposed and it was an ecumenical group where we had multi-racial people speaking, people from different religious backgrounds, presenting Sweet Honey In the Rock gave the first lecture.  And people said, but they're a singing group, means that we stretched the whole construction and Sweet Honey is more than a singing group.  The, when the gay and lesbian committee formed at the Smithsonian, although there was an assistant secretary who was gay, they didn't go to him, they came to us.  And we took on their issue.  We brought Asian-Pacific Americans in that set up the Asian-American--the Asian-Pacific American Center.  I had big battles, even with black people of why we should go to the Asian Studies Conference.  And I said because this is going to be the next group that we've got to work with to open up a front.  The psychology here, like in most mainstream institutions at that time, was a black white psychology.  This was about black and white people.  And, of course, I having a background in Spanish and working with Latino communities, I am black and I'm very clear on that.  But my line was why should we force them to have to go to what we went through.  And that--so we had this cultural diverse, multi-cultural perspective and a lot of those things are still going on in this institution, the hiring and what not that came on.  We opened that up.  We did the first affirmative action program, struggled with the administration, got a pot of money to hire certain groups of people.  John Hope Franklin's son is one of those, my colleague today in this center.  He was talented, skilled, had the ability but people like him couldn't on merit alone, had the meritorious background, get into this institution.  And so when that was taken, I had a lot of pain.  I had a lot of anger.  I had a lot of fear of whether I could actually stay in this industry, would I be run out.  I did not know how to say that. So the first couple of years I was over here, you know, I was sort of, I sort of isolated myself.
Story_ID: 88992
Speaker 1: I, and I'm sort of isolated by nature in the sense that I'm an independent thinker so I'm always, I move across sectors.  I'm not up, out in the margins from people, but I'm sort of my own axis in that regard.  And, but at a certain point, I began to talk about that.  I, it was liberating for me and I thought it was instructive for younger people coming through that these are the kinds of weights and burdens that you're going to bear.  'Cause, not only had we contributed to opening up and democratizing this institution.  It was then a general movement in the society where a lot of people were coming that had no particular relationship to what my work had done over the particular things that me and some other colleagues had been involved in.  And my main reference points was young Latinos who would often say, well, why do I--I'm not a translator.  I'm an anthropologist.  I'm a historian.  And I'm saying, you know, if your generation does not take on the responsibility of helping get things out in your language, you're putting the next generation that further behind.  Their paradigm was I want to be just--not just as Latinos but a lot of blacks and other people and women and so forth, I want to be just like the white people in the solution following my own individual field.  Well, we're not just like them.  We are trained like them, we have the same abilities in many instances but we can't get through the door like them.  So we do have to do translations, we do have to do community outreach in addition to being historians and botanists and biologists and administrators, that's a double, triple duty that history has put before us.  We either will own up to it or we will be narrowly individualistic.  So my talking about the pains that I went through and the self-revelation and being able to, to heal myself and--or to recognize my wounds and some that I still carry.  That's an important benefit that I can offer and it also helps heal, continues to help me heal myself.  So, it took me a while to settle in here and I still live sort of on the margins of this center.  Although I'm at the center of anything I want to be at and I get a lot of positive respect.  I also get a lot of differential respect 'cause I am known as somebody who will battle and take you on.  I don't care about your status and how many degrees you got.  If I think I understand something or contribute something, know in this institution I got into a big spat with the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, who in my view, is racist.  He's the Chancellor of the Smithsonian Board of Regents and got into it over an issue of Latinos, access of Latinos.  And people said but you're not Latino and I said but you know there were no Latinos in the room to speak for themselves and when the late [Daniel Patrick] Moynihan said that's what's wrong with a group think communities and he used another term.  I said I felt like somebody had said nigger but he had--that was--he was not talking about blacks.  Now Moynihan is a bright man, great--but I didn't mind taking him on in a point of principle and, you know, I argued with secretaries of the Smithsonian.  People said you can't do that.  And I said sure I can.  And you can too.  And there happened to be one secretary, Bob McCormick Adams who came in just after I was hired.  You know, he and I fought quite a bit and he would say to me, Early sometimes I don't think you make any sense and other times I find you quite illuminating.  And I felt like fair enough.  And when I was quite illuminating, he moved.  And when I could not convince him, he did not move but he never used his authority to say you have no right to speak.  You know he would say to me often, you are a useful bearer under these people's saddle.  They would go to him and complain.  Other assistant secretaries, you know Early is challenging this and he's ranging across the institution and my view was, I live in the whole institution and until I see people who look like me and from different communities and the mainstream community here, then I'm going to range rather than just stay pigeon holed.
Story_ID: 88993
Speaker 1: Okay, that took a lot of energy.  There were--there was a time that a brother called me and said, he's a Muslim, former drug dealer, very entrepreneur business man, very upstanding citizen, happens to live in my community.  He called me on his cell phone.  He says I'm on my way to the Museum of Natural History and I'm going to be raising hell.  They were about to fire a guard for having cornrows.  Now just a month or so earlier, Marriott Hotel had lost a case of trying to fire a woman who had cornrows. I went to look for he assistant secretary who was head of the administrative side.  There were seven of us, three of us on the academic side I think.  I think three or four on the administrative side.  Very nice man, white man, who had said, but we have rules and regulations here.  And our rules and regulations say that guards must be, have friendly appearance and neutral attire.  And I said, you know a white man with a police uniform on with a star on his chest and a gun on his side is a very threatening symbol to a lot of people that I know.  And you, this is culture.  We are in a cultural institution.  And I cursed him.  And I went at him very hard and I spent that whole weekend churning.  I was not afraid of what I had said, I had overshot the mark.  I got what I wanted.  They backed off but I had denigrated him and I felt really, really bad that you need to be hard, you needed to be direct but you overshot the mark and that's not who I want to be.  And so sharing these lessons with a new group of folk who are coming in who are fighting different kinds of struggles, I think are important that they may be able to find a more productive and wholesome way of taking on struggle.  You got to struggle, if you want change and that's one of the things that I want to impart.  And so, you know, I still look over my shoulder because in some ways I've become much more individualistic than I ever wanted to become.  And therein is a kind of self-centeredness that sometimes borders on arrogance and the like that I do more and more worry about try to figure how I want to bring back in balance.  But that's been a part of my history.  It's about history, I get, you know, I get acknowledged all the time.  Often times the things I had nothing to do with, you know.  A lot of people think that anytime there's Latin music, particularly Latin jazz or something, you're at the Smithsonian, James Early did it.  And I said no, (unclear), there's a whole new generation of people who are more talented than I ever was, who actually studied this stuff (laughter), you know, who were not eclectics but I'm pleased to be, to be associated with that.

Speaker 1: Cuba.  Let's see. You have a great deal of interest in Cuba--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--great deal of interest in Cuba.
Speaker 1: I was reading a piece on the internet that you wrote about, about Cuba and the perception some of have of it as a racist society still after a revolution and people that are, you know, I think one of the, someone that you quoted on, on the net, said, that they found that integration alone was not the answer to racism in Cuba.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: There was, which implied that there was a cultural dimension that has to happen--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--right, and that's rooted in identity.  Cuba was very important for a lot of people in my generation.  Cuba comes in '59 [1959], two years after [Kwame] Nkrumah starts the decolonization movement.  It comes two years after the big movement in Montgomery, the Montgomery Improvement Association and all before, I guess, Southern Christian Leadership Conference and what not moves in more formally in the light.  It, so the anti-colonial movement, the anti-racist movement and then this socialist revolution that does not start out clearly as a socialist revolution and where their construct is a development of the New Man.  The term of art at the time, with all of its humanistic implications but it's sexist grounding.  It's male grounding nonetheless. But Cuba spurred the imagination.  And then you had these iconic, romantic figures, Che Guevara, you know and Fidel Castro.  This was, this was exciting.  It, it, it gave us hope and it stimulated our imagination and, and, and the sense of what we, too, could contribute to changes in society.  So Cuba alone was very, very large for a lot of us, you know, coming out of that '60's [1960] period.  Then Cuba with a significant African diaspora population and more importantly culture where you can see how culture transcends race, where a blond, blue eyes person whose first religion is Santeria.  It was never a particularly catholic country.  They make everybody claim Catholicism but the fastest growing religion sense '59 [1959] in Cuba or these African informed religious world views and practices.  And so that culture really is a big thing there.  And then my own motion, you know, towards the left, to the more formal anti-capitalist pro-socialist left and Cuba was there.  And then the racial identity or cultural identity issue when not only black studies departments were developing but the, the reinvigoration of African languages in places like Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  People studying Swahili and so forth.  People who were taking degrees in African studies and in African history and focusing in, on African political science.  We're going to Africa. I wanted to go to Latin America to find Africa, in a manner of speaking.  One, I had the language, it was closer, economically, etc.  And then my ideological thing, there was Cuba.  So in that context, my look at issues of race and my critiques of race are in the context of my overall unity with the socialist's revolution in Cuba and the ongoing socialist revolution in Cuba.
Story_ID: 88995
Speaker 1: And I've been publicly critical while engaging Cubans 'cause, you know, a lot of us on the left, irrespective of our cultural background, particularly if we were black, our racial background, we could see issues of race and on many instances it's a pat response to the Cubans is you're bringing these North American conceptions in here that race is a social construction.  Well, it is true that race is a social construction.  [W.E.B.] DuBois and all those people understood that.  But DuBois said it is a sociological and historical fact though even though it is a social construction.  And it means, and I've written somewhere that when you reduce it all down in the Americas, no matter how many social constructions of face you have, Mulatto this, claro (ph.), obscuro (ph.), mulatto chino (ph.), negro, prietto (ph.), etc., all of those terms.  It basically boils down to a fundamental distinction between European culture and white physiology--physical features on the one side and non-white on the other.  And that is crystalized fundamentally in the European African divide because of the economics of it all.  It is true that Indian communities have been devastated and massacred and disease, and raped and pillaged and so forth and so on.  But in the functioning of the political economy, generally speaking in the way that these modern republics have been developed in the Americas, it has been on this demonization and this rationalization for the exploitation of black labor and the whole philosophy and social decorum has built, been built around that in demeaning us.  It's also happened to Indians but just look.  And Cuba is one of those examples.  I am pleased to say not without ongoing criticism that there is a public space debate on race going on in Cuba today.  I would like to think that I, among others, have made some small contribution from the outside.  But the fundamental factors have changed, really have been always and will be on the inside of Cuba.  The union of writers and artists in Cuba have had a debate going on about issues of race in Cuba and I wrote a piece that is not up on the net, that is in the second volume of "Sols" (ph.) magazine, Manny Mirabal's magazine coming out of Columbia University on reflections of race in Cuba, where it was designed really as a polemic with people on the American left and with the Cuban communist party.  And I basically said, I'm reflecting what people in Cuba tell me.  There's no question whether I'm bringing some of my own views, how could I not help but bring some of my own views?  But I'm trying to look at what the internal factors say. So now there's a project in Cuba called Colodinical bono (ph.), which comes out of the union of writers and artists, which is maybe the first time in the history of the whole Cuban republic, not just the Cuban Revolution that the state has embraced a pro-active project of racial identification in the context of common national identity.
Story_ID: 88996
Speaker 1: There was a massacre in the late 1800's, I think it was.  After the first revolution with Spain about the black middle class who had fought against Spain and said they wanted to be a part and they were not fully let in.  And then in the 1930's or so, Gloria Rolando, the black Cuban filmmaker has done a film which I've not yet seen on the 1930's, the Partido, the black party that was formed and the massacre of the middle class.  Now Fidel Castro talks about ongoing issues of racial discrimination in the context of advances.  And in a broader sense, my polemic with them at the practical level has been look, there's now a big movement throughout the Americas.  I do a lot of work and have done for the last fifteen, eighteen, maybe almost twenty years with Afro descendent networks from, all the way from as deep south as Uruguay, where I'm down at least once a year, and particularly in Brazil where I'm done once or twice a year, sometimes three times a year, right into Central America and in places like Puerto Rico.  A number of networks taking on issues of micro-enterprise, access of women health issues, housing issues, participation in the political process, etc.  This is how their taking--and not just what are their relationship with Africa.  There is that cultural component but it's no longer the cultural nationalist kind of negritude cultural dimension that it was mostly at an earlier point.  And in that context of motion, Brazil and the U.S. merge are merged as the two models.  Both and Brazil--until recently Brazil was not willing to admit but both which will now admit, yes, we have racism in our societies but we are the model way to go.  And I said, no, there's a third model, Cuba.  The problem with Cuba is Cuba doesn't have a construct about racial identity.  Their line is todos de nosotros somos Cubanos.  We're all Cubans.  Todos de nosotros compartimos (uncler) de Africa, we all have African blood in our veins.  Well, that's nice metaphorically and it's also a good national identity direction to go but national identity is composed of various racial ethnic historically formed currents.  And so that I've raised the question as well as some others is when you look at the health issues, is there any correlation between race and health notwithstanding the, the equitable way that the Cubans have tried to approach across the board, education and in health and so forth and so on.  How is it that in the higher echelons of the Cuban communist party, there have been so few black people?  Is it because there inherently inferior?  Now they say, well you know they come from a background of the least educated so forth and so on.  That's true but the affirmative steps of the revolution have done such wonderful things for boxers, the world's leading male ballet dancer is a black Cuban [Carlos Acosta].  So where are they in--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And, and all of those folk.
Speaker 2: If you watch the Olympics, you see the black athlete.
Speaker 1: Precisely, even black gymnasts and so, but there is a more dynamic motion going on now which I stay attuned to and try to learn from and where I can try to make a contribution and try to also calibrate the fact that I am not Cuban.  And that I do have a North American--I'm from a North American vantage point about race but no, I've been referred to in Cuba on certain occasions as a mulatto and I smile black students when I tell them this and you just get very upset.  Well, weren't you angry and I said well, from their social construction of race, a black man like me with a big time title working at a national museum and the amount of money that I'm able to spend, that whitens, that is one of the cultural dynamics in Latin America that has not occurred here but--yet.  So that's Cuba has--Cuba continues to play an important role.  I think it's the most important state or project going on.  I have some criticisms of it.  But in terms of what's it's been able to do in terms of education and health and the like, it's astounding, this small, tiny speck of 11 million people in a world of six and a half billion people, it's a tremendous advance.  I'm headed down there this Sunday for another conference and discussions and the like.
Speaker 2: Do you think they're headed in the right direction?
Speaker 1: That's a big question.  I think as a philosophical direction--yes.  Practically, I think there's some major things to be addressed.  The issue of dissident voices in a socialist country--is every dissident voice a kind of revolutionary voice?  Is every dissident voice a unpatriotic voice?  I say no.  This is one of the questions I'm going to raise with the minister of culture.  I was talking to another colleague.  I chair the board at the Institute for Policy Studies here and I was talking to Saland Davis (ph.), one of the fellows about the importance of now asking the Cubans to hold a conference on issues of freedom and dissidence and the like and bring in the Noam Chomskis and people who have raised some recent criticisms, Eduardo Galeano and others to have--not a--it's not a discussion about Cuba per se but a bigger question to see if we can expand in the public space new democratic conceptions and possibilities which might help the Cubans but also would help all of us.
Story_ID: 89760
Speaker 1: You probably want to talk about what we talking about but--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, you know. Yeah, I've--Cuba continues to be important and this reference to Carlos Moore, you know, I think it's unfortunate, almost tragic in some ways.  I think his book had a lot of, a lot of compelling empirical data about issues of race and discrimination in Cuba.  But the ideological construct he put on it of the kind of strident, anti-Castro strident, anti-socialist construct and put him, aligned him with right-wingers.  And it's fair to be, to critique communism and socialism and to be against that.  But one would hope that you would come up with a kind of third construct that realistically that societies might strive towards rather than to by implication and/or by direct affiliation go back to a racist capitalist construct under [Fulgencio] Batista and those kind of folk.  And so there's a dynamic moment going on about the debates of race, about race in Cuba that's being debated in public space and public institutions and among public institutions that, then he is unable to become a part of in the way that another black Cuban who lives outside of Cuba, Pedro [Perez] Sarduy is able to participate in.  Pedro whose written, he and his wife, his English wife, Jeane Stubbs, two books on Afro-Cuba, one of which Manning Marable and I have a short preface or introduction to the second book, is able to go in and out of Cuba although he lives in England.  I think probably he's an English citizen.  And really engage that debate and be recognized, his voice be recognized as a useful one in a way that Carlos is trapped in a more narrow racial nationalist kind of framework.  And Carlos is a really gifted and talented guy.  And it's, we don't see much of each other but occasionally we--that last time, I guess, we were in Uruguay together and we ran into one each other, each other in Brazil on one occasion and years ago here in the U.S. we met once.
Story_ID: 89761
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--as we were discussing earlier about Cuba, culture seems to be an important element in racial, in racism basically.  Black business man recently told us as, The HistoryMakers, as we were interviewing him that black people, if they had known his product was produced by a black person, they probably wouldn't buy it so he had to hide the fact that he was black for sales in the white community and black community.
Speaker 2: Hmmmm hmmmm.
Speaker 1: I mean, what's your thought on that--you work in a cultural institution--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I forget which cultural theorist that said that culture is perhaps the most difficult term in the English language to define.  But by any definition, I think what is emerged at this moment in human history is that culture is as certainly as an important an element as military might or economic wherewithal.  In fact, I would go beyond that and say that culture is the, the milieu, the context, the matrix in which these other institutional expressions like economics, military issues, family issues, business, recreation, health, they're all sort of vertical expressions of a context called culture.  And by that, I'm getting at culture as basic creative human ability, ways of knowing and doing.  Those are the things that fundamentally make us different.  So that every society, for example, has a table, various kinds of table but the meaning that they associate it with, some may be only for men or certain religious groups or women or children, they all serve as platforms on something to go, that sort of their universal connection.  But then their meaning are the different ways of knowing and doing, the values that we assign to it.  And even among black people, there are cultural distinctions, sometimes antagonistically but certainly there.  There is no African personality, I think, you know, in the debate with Sangor or who is the black psychiatrist out of the Caribbean?
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: Black, white, black skinned white mask--
Speaker 1: [Frantz] Fanon.
Speaker 2: Fanon opened that up for us.
Story_ID: 89762
Speaker 1: And so that culture and--is very important.  And one of the things about colonization, one of the things about dominance is to turn people against their culture and to endear them with the culture of the oppressor.  So just take a simple thing of men and women of any society.  It's amazing what a man as a pimp can do with a woman, black, white, green and where the man, in some construction of maleness becomes the reference point.  And so one of the examples that I like to use is--and it's unfortunate and tragic example but one that resonates very deeply is that several years ago here, I forget which republican administration right here in the Washington Metropolitan area, I think it was out in Maryland, perhaps in Virginia, a lieutenant or some--one of military guy, white, upper class, his wife who was educated had wherewithal, he was brutally beating her.  She psychologically could not leave him because the construction of a whole woman is one with a man.  To leave him and take her children is to deprive the children of a father.  That is a--and we know it in the black community, the recent book by Johnetta [HM] Cole and Beverly Guy-Sheftall, "Gender Talk In the African American Community" where repeatedly go back to very abusive men.  I mean who have done the most horrible, physical things to them.  Because their self-conception as woman has been turned inside out and using a male conception of wholeness as a reference point.  Well take to issues of language, to adopt somebody else's language, somebody else's religion, it's a psychological problem, destabilization that goes on.  And certainly on the question of race, where they're many black people who think if it's a black doctor, a black car salesman, a black housing developer, they cannot be as good as the reference point, whiteness.  And then sure enough, if you find one instance 'cause we--all society have people who fail, that makes--that one instance makes a whole case.  That's a deep psychological issue.  Today in Africa, there's still many heads of state, a recent article has shown, who are bleaching their skin.  One entire family in Africa, one of the biggest environmental health problems today, manufactured by individuals is black people bleaching the skin of babies, little babies.  This take the pigmentation out in a tropical zone and causing early incidences of cancer.  The same is going on in places like Jamaica where young women are bleaching themselves.  That is a deep psychological trauma that dates back, evolves out of issues of slavery and toward the straightening of our hair and conking of our hair and all of that kind of--it's such a deep psychological thing that gets transferred across generations, not as a biological proposition but as a social proposition.  It's sort of like the genes of history .  I ain't no African, I got nothing to do with Africa.  You know that still resonates very deeply because of the notion of the jungle and monkeys and all of that stuff that the mass media, the dark continent put on us.  And then we see that demonization, you know, extended today in the civilized and uncivilized.  And I think about [W.E.B.] DuBois in this instance.  You know DuBois in 1903 when he wrote "The Souls of Black Folk" on the Color Line is the major question of the 20th Century.  In 1953, when he was asked if he would consider re-writing the book, he said he wanted to leave it as a testament to his original thought.  But he wrote a new preface in which he said there were three things he wanted to address and--two, I always remember when I can't, one, he--I think I can remember all three.  Freud, he had not become familiar enough with the works of Freud and he regretted that.  And that while he was familiar with the work of Marx, he thought that the people had taught him about Marx had not done an adequate job.  But he very poetically says I still believe today as yesterday, that the color line is a major problem, not the major problem of the 20th Century.  And I've come to understand that behind it are issues that both motivate it and obscure it at the same time.
Story_ID: 89763
Speaker 1: And that is the fact that a minority of people are willing to live in luxury and ease at the great expense of human kind living in ignorance and poverty and disease. And that to rationalize this, they will invariably go to war against people of color.  And then you look characteristically at the wars that are going on in the world today, there all on the other side of a Eurocentric paradigm, not always involving issues of color or race, but issues of ethnicity, vis a vis European issues, Christianity versus terrorists, fundamentalists, Muslims unquote.  We won't talk about Christian terrorism, bombing abortion clinics and bombing gay and lesbian institutions and so forth and so one.  So that your--race as paradigm that was laid down with all the rationalizations are extended in many ways to demonize and it is still an issue that, you know, evolves in the 20th Century.  People like Clarence were saying, an American university who were looking at race in a global context of the new iterations of race, as tied to issues of culture.  Because ultimately, the profiling of people based on physical appearance is to be able to get at some supposedly intrinsic or essentialist perspective about them, their language, their religion, what they cook and eat, how they dress, how they dance, that's really what it is.  And so even today when we see what I call cultural profiling, you take a blond, white skinned, blue eyed woman, who has a burka over it, then she's culturally profiled by way of dress, to get at some sense that she, of what her religion and what her world view is supposed to be, how that is supposed to correlate with her dress.  Well, this is the same content of issues, of race, except that race is not the outward index that's being used.  And even when race is outward index for black people, it is some sense of our inner supposed selves that people are trying to distinguish and to discriminate against, not just that we look like monkeys but that we are a sub-specie is really what the implication of that and our ability to learn or to express, or to create great art or great literature.  That's really what it's at, in addition to historically rationalizing the exploitation of our labor.
Story_ID: 89764
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Well, internally, in a global world, I think we are--there are many objective factors that suggest that this is a global era and just take the black community in the United States, what do we mean by the black community in the United States?  Well, issues historically of racism which sets up a differential and life chances and notions of what's good, truth and beautiful and what's access to material life, those are what the fundamental distinctions of drawing racial of men.  That the public policy, the public space policies that have been evolved to confront and to remediate that and to set up more equitable grounds is really based on a construction of blackness or race from the descendants of enslaved Africans in the United States.  And while we still are the great majority in terms of a historical or inter-generational stock, if you will.  Since the 1965 Immigration Act, new African diaspora communities coming and people from the African continent, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Senegal, Afro-Cubans, Afro-Venezuelans, Afro-Panamanians, Afro-Caribbeans, Trinidadians, Jamaicans, who share the same biological stock, if you will.  And which we may look alike in terms of what the outward or physical social construction of race determines that yes, we are black, but culturally, in terms of historical formation, there are many distinctions.  Not necessarily antagonistic.  If you came out of a Spanish speaking Latin America as a black and you're religious and most people are in our community religious, you're bound to be catholic, not protestant.  So when you look at the black leadership council, it is essentially a protestant leadership council, not an ecumenical leadership council.  The issues of language, creole or Spanish.  There's a reason that in Miami official language--official communication from the school system, I think it still goes on, is sent home in three languages, English, Spanish and Haitian-Creole, not French, but Haitian-Creole.  Those are cultural distinctions within the black community that become antagonistic when public policy is premised on a notion of a uniformity of blackness, a homogeneity of language, religious outlook and the like.  It means that you don't have a nuanced, diverse, multi-faceted public policy that grasps these cultural distinctions, that then become antagonistic cultural factors in the black community.  So that's a principle concern as we try to move the racial democracy project forward in the United States.  It's to recognize the growing variety and distinctions in our community, that if not attended to, will turn into fractures and remove us from the main target and have us involved in more in-fighting.  You're already seeing certain reflections of that in the political arena in New York of how people run for office and the like.  And you, you see it not as an antagonistic phenomenon necessarily but you take any metropolitan area and increasingly smaller townships of a historically black church that on Thursday night or Sunday afternoon, it is Latin population worshipping in it or an Ethiopian religious population and where you have a traditional protestant religion mixed with certain Africanisms coming out of distinct areas of Africa, sometimes West Africa, sometimes South Africa.  So when we say black religion, we've got to get a more complex sense of what that's about in order to have public space policy so that's one thing.
Story_ID: 89765
Speaker 1: The other thing is that racism is taking on more refined form.  Racism is a living dynamic phenomenon.  It's not a static issue, you know, many young--when I was around the university teaching (unclear) would say well this is just like slavery.  And my response would be that's a useful metaphor if you can put it in a very determined way.  But this is not slavery.  You should go back and read what slavery was about.  Because then people only stay in a critique mode.  I worry that we stay in a critique mode and not enough in a critique and transformative mode.  They are two elements that form one whole equation.  So that a lot of young black educated adults talk about resistance, a very important term coming into the 1960s and other early periods as well.  But certainly coming in in 1960s.  Resist--well they've reified resistance.  Resistance is not a transformative.  Resistance is trying to keep people from over-running what you have achieved.  But life is a living proposition and so we have to resist in order to transform.  We have to critique in order to create.  Those are the two dynamics that put a whole together.  And I worry that we are not giving young adults and youngsters in high school that kind of orientation.  I don't mean give them the answer but give them that kind of forward proactive orientation to engage.  One of my concerns tied to that and it's a longstanding term is and it's something again, and I guess this must have been the '90s [1990], again on one of my trips to Cuba happen to be with a group that Manning Marable organized and we were having discussions of race and I raised a lot of critical issues with the Cubans of race and my colleagues were upset, my black colleagues were upset.  Some accused me of being arrogant which there may have been some element of truth there but I thought more fundamentally there was an element of embarrassment on their part.  We're all revolutionaries.  We all know that there's some unsettled issues of race in Cuba.  We all want to address them but we have become so canonical, so straight-laced in our outlook that we don't know how to raise the issue.  And at a certain point, I said, you know, we have to grapple with the fact and own up to the fact in a positive way that we are Americans.  We are citizens of the United States.  I'm not a Cuban.  I'm not a Nigerian.  I'm not a Brazilian.  I'm not a Senegalese. I share a broad heritage and cultural frame of reference with them as a family of culture and a brotherhood and a racial identification, all of that.  But I am formed here in the United States and I have to own the good and the bad and struggle to eradicate the bad.  Many, many black people don't want to have a proprietary and ownership relationship to the United States.  That is also a product of the history of slavery and racism and racial discrimination, that we have never been treated like Americans.  You know it goes to Langston Hughes, America to me you have never been but America you will be.  It's that [W.E.B.] DuBois and double consciousness, you know, ever the twoness.  A negro and an American straining to be one but not wanting to adopt all of the ugly, brutal sides of this country vis a vis us and other people in the country and indeed the entire world.  But we--so we--this dilemma that we have of ownership.  And it's a very--it's a fundamentally important question, particularly for the upcoming generation of black Americans to take on because in an objective global society where the United States is the pivot of the world, particularly in some of the most egregious new empire imperialist ways.  We cannot be visitors here.  We cannot allow ourselves to be marginal as second class citizens.  We have to have an orientation as owners, part of the ownership group.  And I--the interest of our own well-being and humanity and in the interest of complementing the creativity of other people's humanity around the world.  And if we--we have been the crucible for American democracy, since the founding of this republic.  We have been the fundamental and most consistent test case on most of the major life defining issues across the board.  So coming out of the '60s [1960] as a more recent example the new iteration of the women's movement, the centric movements about Mexican studies, Puerto Rican studies, Irish American studies, genealogical studies for whatever color or racial ethnic group that you come from, the gay and lesbian movement.  All of those centric movements looked at precedent set in law and in institutional practice that came out of our breaking of American apartheid to build on it.  Most of us don't grasp that, that dynamic contribution.  When the-(unclear) took on the Soviet Union, he says I was reading Martin Luther King when the demonstrations went on in Trinidad I think in the '70s [1970].  They were shouting black power, you know.  That came out of our formation, historically within the context to the United States.  And I don't mean to be narrow nationalist or narrowly proprietary about that, but this is what makes us social beings, social citizens, not only in this country but also this emerging citizens, being citizens of the world, which is a question for everybody, not just us.  But that's, that's an issue that we have to be proactive--more proactive and engaged.  So I worry that we have not had enough of that kind of engagement.
Story_ID: 89766
Speaker 1: And finally, I would say in that context, this is something that is, is articulated, I think, quite strongly again in this new book on gender talk, Johnnetta Cole, Johnnetta Betsch Cole [HM] and, and Beverly Guy-Sheftall is this whole notion of airing our dirty laundry in public.  That's a historically specific useful approach.  We are far beyond that history.  We have to have more public space critical engagement of one another about shortcomings despite the fact that we're black because there is no one type of black person.  We're trying to create new people.  I mean life is about new dynamics, new creativity and this notion of airing our dirty laundry is really from the period of segregation.  We're not in the period of segregation.  There may be segregated elements of our society but if we cannot take on each other critically in the public space then we're hiding something about our weaknesses and our strengths.  And we won't benefit nor will we be able to contribute to the benefit to the whole society.  And this society is not going anywhere without us.  And we're not going anywhere without it.  You know, so there will be no separate five black states or we turn to Africa or some such Zioness as kind of proposition that we see in the most narrow constructs of, of Israel for example, which is also running up against that same limitation, those segments that are narrow in the process.  So these are, these are some of the things.
Story_ID: 89767
Speaker 1: Okay. Now you are still young but what--we always ask this question--what would you see as your legacy to this point?
Speaker 2: Now this is a hard question because when Amy Billingsley [HM] called me and said there's this--what is this project called again?
Speaker 1: The HistoryMakers.
Speaker 2: The HistoryMakers--I said to myself well, I'm flattered but I'm not a history maker in one kind of sense.  And therefore in the one kind of sense that I was thinking about I'm not looking to have a individual legacy and I'm very philosophical.  There's probably a lot of this and perhaps even convoluted at least so is some of this of my, my comments have made here.  And so this is how I sort of approach it.  You know in the last number of years, I've begun to read, Antonio Gramsci, you know, he has a very--in the pre-prison notebooks, there's a wonderfully powerful essay that no longer than about four pages on history and what I--it's so fascinating for me about that and helps me reflect on my own development and development of a lot of people, I think is people make history.  Individuals are part, we're social beings, you know and the whole thing no man is an island, neither is a woman.  We need social validation.  We need social interaction and the extent to which we immerse ourselves in all of the things that are going on in our society, we're immersing ourselves in history.  So from the point of view of legacy, I think of social legacy rather than individual legacy, although I acknowledge individual contribution.  In terms of my own individual--and I tried to immerse myself 'cause I've been this dabbler--this professional eclectic, this person who is tied to many different social, racial sectors, cultural sectors and what not--that's how I live my life.  I guess if it's something in the sense of passing on something or leaving something, it's how I have tried to work my wife and I with our children to inform how they might approach the creation of their own lives, rather than say here is a straight line of what you should carry forth or how you do it.  Here's an orientation.  And I think it's going to be in our sons' and in their peer group who relate to us, you know, I'm really pleased that really a wide or large number of our sons' peers come and visit and they us momma and call us daddy.  And they thought that our household had certain liberties and latitudes and enrichments that they may not necessarily found in their own.  Yeah, so that would be the most important thing.  I mean, as I, I hadn't thought about the question but as I now try to respond to you, you know, there's certain things in this institution that I've been a part of, Ralph Rinzler, the late Ralph Rinzler brought me back here.  We did a lot of things together but there many people who informed who Ralph was.  And so those are, you know, some people will look back and say, you know when James Early was around here, certain things got started.  Well they got started with other people and so from a professional point of view, yeah I been a part of a kind of democratic expansion in this institution as I was at the National Endowment for the Humanities.  And beyond that, I don't really have any--I haven't had any formal thinking about it.  And it, it's something that again often the term for me resonates as an individual and that's ideally not the way that I want to think.  Although I am an individual and I do have an ego and I like to be acknowledged but I don't go much beyond that.

Speaker 1: What are you going to do next?  Are you--do you see yourself in this position for a long time or?
Speaker 2: You know I don't know.  At fifty-six, all of my indices of, you know, my doctor said I'm in good health.  I'm actually trying to rejuvenate myself.  I'm in a great exercise mode now and, you know, both sort of spiritually, not religiously, spiritually and physically, you know.  And thinking that I've done--you know, I've put a lot of wear and tear on my body with a lot of dissipation over the years of different things I should not have been doing and that I'm--but I'm pleased of where I am health wise.  So I'm paying a lot more attention to that.  I'm trying to think how to slow down and smell the roses.  I've had a very, very rich fast-paced life in which I have not been patient enough and reflective enough.  And I've not documented it.  I mean I'm actually, you know, trying to figure out how to reflect a little more on that and do less things and go much deeper.  And I'm also thinking about at some point, I will, it may make sense for me to retire from this place.  I mean I make great money, relatively speaking but my wife is retired and really has found a whole 'nother dimension of herself and her artwork and what not that it would be really good to spend some really more quality time with her.  We spend a lot of time together and in some ways, repay her for all the sacrifices she made by being a little more human and, and maybe end up around a university in where I can share some of the experiences and knowledge that I have as well as be a--learn something, really be a part of an emerging young generation which invariably is going to lead our communities and the world, whether we like it or not.  They're going (laughter) and it would be wonderful to share with them and also to learn from them.  I mean there's some really bright young people out here so that--those are things that are on my mind.
Story_ID: 89006
Speaker 1: One last question we always ask is how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Boy, I mean that's probably pretty standard.  I'd like to be remembered as a, as a social person, a social being, someone who found his own identity in the context of engaging others, sharing and learning with others.  I'd like to be remembered basically as a principle person, someone who was sort of transparent about what the values, social values he was working with and making decisions about.  And someone who's honest, when asked, you know, really responds to what the truth as he understands it or as he practiced it is about.  Someone who is generous, you know, with certainly his time, particularly with younger folk and I--in  particular way would like to be remembered as I think many people certainly have acknowledged my wife and children and I over the last twenty-seven years as someone who is family centered.  You know we took our kids everywhere, engaged them in everything and some said, you know, people today said, well, where are your children?  And I said, well, you know they're not children.  They're now twenty-seven and twenty-four years old.  But it makes know that any sense of me as an individual was always in relationship to them being present and being engaging.  And that's, that's how we wanted it to be.  And we actually--and that's how we actually lived it.  Yeah, those would be the things.
Speaker 1: Alright, well thank you, sir.
Speaker 2: Thank you.  Thank both of you.
Story_ID: 89007
Speaker 1: Yeah, I do. This is in the foreground, Ralph Rinzler (ph.) who has the instrument who was really the major person who developed the Center of Folklife and Cultural Heritage that has now evolved from the Office of Folklife programs and the founding of the Festival of the American Folklife.  He was really the mentor and sort of inspiration for many of us who work in the center today.  And he's guy who made it possible for me to come to the Smithsonian and work.  He sought me out and said I need someone ideological and he recognized a certain kind of ideological outlook and political ability that I had and an ability in a way that allowed me to come and not just be a black person working in unsectoral (ph.) issues here in the Smithsonian but really working across the board on all the key issues and, you know, we often got together this is one evening on a board, on a little lake out here in Virginia with the son next to him is Jamir (ph.) Toussaint Early, who is now twenty-seven, who looks--must have been about fifteen or so there and my wife, Miriam Stewart (ph.) Early and me and then our youngest son, Jaben (ph.), who is now actor filmmaker at--studying at Sarah Lawrence (ph.). (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: This photograph is a useful second photograph in that this is a photograph that was put together by Ralph.  He brought this into the office one day.  On top is Fannie Lou Hamer and Rosa Parks and underneath are--is a photo of our children that may have been taken at Ralph's home, here on Capitol Hill here in Washington and they look to be, you know, seven and five or something like that, six and a half, seven and five.  And it's--it reflects the relationship that we had with Ralph and how he put us all in a context of black community struggle, but particularly around two strong black women who have contributed a lot to American democracy, not in addition to what they contributed to the development of African Americans so it's a favorite picture for me think about them and where they come from and where they may be going but also to think about this connection that we had with Ralph.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: Ready?  This is a photograph taken probably around 2001, May in Amsterdam, back of the Transnational Institute where I serve as an advisor on cultural democracy policy.  This is with my oldest son, Jamir Toussaint who had after several years of hard work finished--finally finished college and wanted to go to Spain but I couldn't go to Spain so he went to Amsterdam with me and he has remained in Europe for the last two years, all except for one week when he came home for his brother's graduation.  And this is a photograph taken by Johan (ph.) Hipler (ph.), a German scholar, activist.  And for me, it's a good photograph of the friendship that Jamir and I share in addition to our, my being his father and he being my son.  I mean we, we really do operate simultaneously on both those plains and this was our first of what now has turned out to be a number of meetings of being together in Europe.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE)
Speaker 2: Yeah, again, this is an extension of our family construct.  This also happens to be out in Ralph's yard on Capitol Hill, he and Kate, his wife Shod (ph.).  Kate is in the bottom hand right portion of the picture that's sort of difficult to see.  And the black woman there in the black is Jane Sapp (ph.) who was around the Highlander Center and the big guy there is the founder of the Highlander Center whose name is escaping me now.  And then our oldest son sitting with my wife, Miriam, and then there's Amy Harwood whose a close colleague and extended family member looking while I'm dialoguing with them.  And then our youngest son in the red and I--actually that's Kate Winslow on the left hand side.  But again, this was a part of the extension of work into family and activism.
Speaker 1: Okay, what year is this, did you say?
Speaker 2: You know I, I don't, I don't know what year this would be.  The children look to be again probably about five and seven so this would have been going back about--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: 1980 or so?
Speaker 2: Let's see that would have been about twenty, twenty years ago.  So what would that be?  That would be--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Eighty-three.
Speaker 2: Around '83 [1983] maybe or so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And this is me and my bureaucratic days, when I was the Assistant Secretary for Public Service and Education.  That's the director of the National Park Service, Robert Stanton, speaking there whom I had a lot of discussions with about black folk and our--what we tried to do in our jobs in the federal complex.  This is in 1990 and then that's a woman who's the board of regents, Jeanine Smith Clark (ph.), who's always been very helpful to me.  That I always thought she is a mainstream black woman, and mainstream values but she's a race woman and I, my subjective sense was always she thought that well, James Early has some talent and some ability and some contributions that he can make, just at times wish he would be a bit more normantive in his way.  And that's Bob Adams, world renowned archeologist and anthropologist, who is secretary of the Smithsonian Institution and we're conferring at the opening of the Folklife Festival.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And this is a very important portrait for us again.  Our family, this portrait has multiple meanings for us because it's one in a series over the years of family portraits that the renowned African American photo documentarist, who's also a research associate here at our center at the Smithsonian.  Roland Freeman has shot and we have portraits that he's done of the family in various locations that he's run into us over the years at festivals and at weddings which were not planned.  Some which have become, one in particular have become somewhat of a famous photographer that's been published in major photography books over the years.  After a number of years of not running in us, running into us together as a family since the children, you know, have grown up into young men and have sort of their own lives, he said over the course of about a two year period, he says you know I haven't done a portrait of you and your family in a long time.  So he came to the house one day and set up that black backdrop and asked us to dress in black.  And this is one of three or four shots that he has taken and that must be about year 2000 or so, I think that was shot.
Speaker 1: That's an excellent shot.
