Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe, and I'm the interviewer for the HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Observing is Alison Bruzek.   Sir, can you please give us your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: It's Frank Dale Morgan.
Speaker 1: And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: It's May 14, 1947.  And the place of birth is Kitty, Guyana.
Speaker 1: How do you spell the first name of your city?
Speaker 2: Like the small call, kitty, K-I-T-T-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Kitty--
Speaker 2: It's a suburb of Georgetown, Guyana.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And sir, what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: I'm a professor of geophysics in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: What is today's date?  I have no idea.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I think it's the 10th, right? October the 10th--
Speaker 2: It's close, it's close enough.  I don't think anyone will know the difference.
Speaker 1: --2012.
Speaker 2: 2012, yes.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're in the tallest building at MIT.  It's called the Green Building.  And Cecil Green was one of the great philanthropists, really, in America.  And he started Texas Instruments and a geophysical company, Western Geophysical.  So, he's always been a close friend to this department.  And he and his wife gave us this building many years ago.  But many other institutions have Green buildings--devoted to him, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.
Story_ID: 24821
Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we ask as sort of a warm-up, and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Favorite food, that one is easy. Any version of curry, any version of curry.  I can eat curry seven days a week.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Favorite color?  Probably red.
Speaker 1: Favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Favorite time of the year.  It would be probably be on a beach in the Caribbean, which would not be--I mean if you're thinking of the four seasons, I would say summer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Well, since I don't really take vacations, it's a hard one.  Everyone encourages me to take vacations, but I'm always so busy.  Even the sabbatical which I get every five years, I've never taken it.  I'm too busy. But favorite places I would think of going to--I like the small island of Curacao, off of Venezuela, Columbia. I find it's is a very nice place.  I like Rio de Janeiro [Brazil], and a place I visited recently, I really think is one of the charming places.  It's an island, a Greek island called Cyprus.  I think that's a very nice place.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: It depends who I'm talking to.  But the first thing that comes to mind is I try to tell everyone to focus.
Story_ID: 24822
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, but separately, so we don't get them mixed up.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: In terms of her maiden name, too?  It's Jean, JEAN, her middle name is Malcolm, M-A-L-C-O-L-M, and the last name is Bacchus, B-A-C-C-H-U-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth is June 30, 1928.  And the place of birth is Georgetown, Guyana.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what can you tell us about the ancestors on your mother's side?  How far back can you trace them, and what were they doing?  What occupations were they--
Speaker 2: A little. You know, coming from the Caribbean, ancestry is very mixed up.  Hardly anyone is pure this or pure that or pure the other.  So, you can trace it a little way but, you know, you either hit slavery or you hit the indentured laborers that came from India, or something like that.  So, you can trace it a bit.  In the case of my mother, on her mother's side it's very difficult to trace.  I think she was probably from a family that in the Caribbean we might call--she had a French ancestry to her, I think from Martinique or Guadeloupe [Caribbean islands].  And so, she might be considered like a local white or something in those days.
Speaker 1: Now what do you mean by a local white?
Speaker 2: Well, it's white people that came to the Caribbean, to all the islands.  And they basically settled there and stayed there, they were not like visitors.  All the islands have people like this.  But again, purity would be a problem after a generation or two, you know.  They certainly mixed with someone or the other.
Speaker 1: So even the local whites would be, might be mixed with something, some--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you could usually tell they're not, you know, Caucasian, really, you know, lily white, as we would say it.  But she certainly had that ancestry to some degree.  I don't know what else she had coming with her--all of that--she kept very secret for reasons I'm not quite sure what the motivation for keeping it secret.  But it kinda ends there, I mean, I know some of her sisters and so forth, and they--, but you can't get further back than that very much.
Speaker 1: You can't get back to your great-grandparents on that side?
Speaker 2: On that side at all, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Story_ID: 24823
Speaker 1: But you did know your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Yes, I knew her very well, yes.
Speaker 1: And what was her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Olive, O-L-I-V-E.  And I guess her, I'm not sure what her maiden name is.  I know it, but it's not coming to me immediately.  But you know, I just know--
Speaker 1: So her maiden name would be French?
Speaker 2: I think it is a French name, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  Were there any stories about your grandmother that you remember?
Speaker 2: The only thing that stays with me, because I was telling someone the story a week ago.  She was a, quite an awesome, let me say seamstress or dressmaker.  And she was so talented that she would just look at the person and say, "What kind of style do you want?"  And "Come back next week."  And she would just put the clothes on the floor, there was a wooden floor in those days, and just cut this piece of cloth straight.  I mean, it was an amazing thing to see--and sew it, and it would fit people perfectly.  So, she had some kind of strange talent that way.  But--
Speaker 1: So, she could really size them up, as they say.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she could, like, you know.  I think--unfortunately, a good side story of that is that she taught me how to sew a shirt, how to sew a pant, how to sew a jacket, I did not enjoy it at all, and I don't want to take it up as a profession.  But I did learn how to do tailoring through her, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what about your grandfather?
Speaker 2: My grandfather, his name is Ussman, U-S-S-M-A-N, Bacchus, BACCHUS.  I think his middle name is McDoom, M-c-D-O-O-M.  And as you can tell from the name, he comes from a Muslim origin, Islamic.  And his father actually came to the Caribbean on a merchant ship from somewhere in Arabia at the time.  It's kind of lost, we don't know where.  A couple of words that I traced down from there--and I've asked around, people have said it's most likely Oman, or it could be the Emirates.  But he came on a merchant ship and met my great-grandmother and decided to stay there.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: My grandfather, I guess the memorable thing that you would think about him is, he was a kind of a famous bodybuilder.  We had maybe the biggest gym at our house in the country.  And he did pose for one of these magazines like Mr. Universe or something, only with a fig leaf on.  And my grandmother did not like that at all.  But that was his thing.  And one of his brothers actually started one of the largest gyms in New York City after that.  But his thing was just weightlifting.  And I think even his two sons, my uncles, were into competitive weightlifting.  So, it's the world I grew up in--I didn't particularly carry on the tradition, but it's the world I grew up in, in competitions and so forth, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's interesting.  I never heard anybody talk about that before in an interview (unclear).
Speaker 2: My grandmother [Olive Bacchus] was Roman Catholic.  And he never insisted at all that we be Islamic or anything like that.  He just let, you know, I went to Catholic schools all my life and so forth.  He just kind of stayed out of it.  There was never an issue in the family.
Speaker 1: Did he practice Islam?
Speaker 2: Yeah, not in the sense of you, you know, I see some of our students here practicing it, praying.  No, I mean, he might go occasionally to the mosque, but occasionally might be once a year or once every six months or something like that, you know.  And if he did pray on his own, I certainly never saw it, you know, so--.
Speaker 1: Now, what did he do for a living?
Speaker 2: Where are we starting?  With my grandfather, going backwards, or my mother [Jean Bacchus]--
Speaker 1: With your grandfather.  I was--
Speaker 2: He, for most of the time that I knew him--well, no, I think when I was really small, he had a traditional sort of little shop in the market that sold things like, you know, beans and rice and so forth.  It was very much like the kind of shop that you would see in the Middle East in the market.  But that's what--and I remember my mother having to go and, you know, he would weigh out a pound of rice and a pound of beans and so forth, and have them ready for when people came in.  But that's the earliest job I can remember him having.  After that, I think, probably until he retired, he worked as the senior cashier for what was called the Rice, R-I-C-E Marketing Board.  And it was a very big and responsible job, because rice in the country of Guyana was one of the major sources of finance, so--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a good job for him because he was definitely a very, you know, strict disciplinarian, very honest and you know, a stickler for every single thing.  And I think that's what he did most of his life, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 24824
Speaker 1: Now, what was your mother's [Jean Bacchus] aspirations?  Did she get an education in Guyana?
Speaker 2: Now it's a rather interesting question too with my mom.  Because, I guess any how you try to look at this, analyze it, calculate it, my mom was a bona fide genius.  In the Commonwealth [of Nations] and England, you take, when you're maybe sixteen or seventeen, you take something called the ordinary level [O-level] subjects.  And they were examinations that are either by Cambridge University or London University [England].  And then after that, you had the advanced level [A-levels], which was another two or three years.  Most people took that at eighteen or nineteen.  Well, my mom finished all of her ordinary levels at age ten.  And as I understand the story, when she tried to do her advanced levels at eleven, they said that she was too young, that she should come back at age twelve.  So, she finished all of her school at age eleven, age twelve.  And again, of course, this is just a story I'm hearing, I don't know.  She, between that and getting married to my dad, she would read about five books everyday.  So, she has a--, my son always likes to say, anything academic that we have, we've gotten from her.  You know, probably she knows every word in the English dictionary and so forth.  And I think--it's true even, you know, as I came into the world and grew up and so forth, she has never been in a class in her life that she has not been number one.  She does not know number two position.  But it's just sort of natural to her, and easy. Even in her old age she would, you know, do Spanish and do this and do the other.  She was, it was just very easy for her.  But you know, in the old days, her two brothers went to the university, and she got married.  That was the idea.  And I think there were--, there was a fair amount of friction because of that, between my father and her.  My father was, you know, quite a smart guy and so forth and whatever, but I can remember my mom correcting him all the time, you know, at the dinner table when he didn't use a word correctly or something like that (laughter).  And of course, you know, that leads to a little bit of embarrassment and friction.  But, it's a pity, I mean, even when she came to live up here in Cambridge [Massachusetts], twenty years or so ago--and I've always told her, you know, "Why don't you just go to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] now, you know, you're still going to ace it out."  We talked about it, and (unclear) she never really did that, you know.  And so, she is special in that respect, and--.
Speaker 1: So, did she live her life as basically a housewife, or did she go--
Speaker 2: No, no, in fact, very little of that.  I grew up mostly with my--well, my dad and her separated when I was six years old.  But, I grew up with my grandmother and grandfather mainly.  My mom, you know, I don't think "housewifing" was really for her.  You know, she really should have gone to university and done something special in that way.  But, no, she worked for a long time in the radio business.  She would write what is called the (unclear), advertisements and so forth.  For a lot of her life she worked in that.  And then later on she moved to Trinidad, which I subsequently moved to Trinidad too when I was fourteen.  She went to work for this company that makes--, a large Swedish company that makes vacuum cleaners, Electrolux.  And she eventually became the director of that company in Trinidad and retired.  Myself and her opened a company, and then she eventually came here and just volunteered at the senior center, and did a lot of sort of office stuff for them here.  But you know, mainly things in the senior secretarial administrative direction, yeah.
Story_ID: 24825
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, alright.  Now, let me go to your father's side.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yeah, his name is George Henry, and he has another name too, Drysdale.  I guess that's where I got Dale from.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Drysdale Morgan.  And I know very little of my father's history at all.  It's confusing, because I never knew his mother or father.  And in growing up, you know, I was immersed in a number of uncles and their children, you know, my uncles and aunts and cousins.  And very late in life, maybe I was twenty or something like that, I was told that my father was not a blood relative to them, but he was adopted by that family.  So, that's where he got the name Morgan from.  The family that adopted him, their name was Morgan.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, was the original name Drysdale?
Speaker 2: Well, I think those were his original, you know, sort of names.  I do know the name before his name was changed, it's an Indian name, I'm trying to remember it.  Leave a space, I'll tell you in a minute.  I know the name quite well.  But it was changed to Morgan, and that's where, you know--.  I remember once in Greece, them arresting me, and was searching me for hours because they told me that Morgan cannot be my name, you see, it doesn't match (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what's your father's date of birth?
Speaker 2: I have no idea.  But he was also born in Georgetown, Guyana.
Speaker 1: Okay.  He was born in Georgetown, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, was he older than your mother [Jean Bacchus]?
Speaker 2: I think about five years older.  But they knew each other very well from school.  And they in the early days certainly worked in the same industry, which is in the radio business.  He was an announcer and as I told you, she did all of the writing and the copy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did he have a chance to go to college?
Speaker 2: No, I mean, no, he did not go to college.  I think--before he got married, his original ambition was to become a Seventh Day Adventist minister.  And my understanding is he came down with what was reasonably common in those days, tuberculosis.  So, he was hospitalized for about two or three years and lost one lung.  And when he came out, he decided not to pursue it anymore.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I'm told when I was born, as a boy, he said, "Oh, I didn't make the ministry, I hope this guy does."  So, I didn't follow that footstep (laughter).  That suggestion.
Story_ID: 24826
Speaker 1: Alright.  So, now your parents [Jean Bacchus and Drysdale Morgan] met at school?  They knew each other from school?
Speaker 2: They knew each other from school, yes.  They both went to a rather unique school.  It was a small private school.
Speaker 1: What was the name of it?
Speaker 2: Again, I'll have to think a little hard.  But I should remember that.  And the son of the (unclear; the person who ran the) school also went down to do a lot of great things in the world.  But I think by and large, nearly everyone that went to the school--it was run by the military you know, as a private school.  You know, schooling at that time in the Caribbean, I mean, going back to my own history, was very different to say, schooling here.  I started real school, not play school, at age three.  I mean, you know, by age five you could do arithmetic, you could write a letter, and there was no question about it.  I mean, they whipped it into you more or less, but you learned it (laughter).  So, you know, and when saw my son go to school here at age six or something, and they really don't know anything when they start here.  It's just a completely different vision of what education should be.  Well, the name of the school was Ramphal, Ramphal School.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: R-A-M-P-H-A-L.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You had to pay tuition, I guess, to go?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't know how that worked in those days.  It was a private school, but I suspect the tuition was--well, relative terms who knows if it was little or nothing, but you certainly would have had to pay, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It was run by, was it a church organization?
Speaker 2: No, it was named after Mr. Ramphal, he actually ran the school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there a story about how your parents met, or how they became--
Speaker 2: I know nothing of how they met, except in school.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) No story about how they fell in love or anything like that--
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 24827
Speaker 1: So, when you think about your parents' [Jean Bacchus and Drysdale Morgan] personalities, their dispositions, their habits, and looks, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: It's hard to say I've taken after either of them.  I think certainly the answer for me is a little easier with my father, that I kind of consciously as a late teenager or so, made a strong decision--, it was actually a negative decision in a way.  But I decided I didn't want to be like my father. That was not the kind of man that I wanted to be.  And it happened one day when I saw a bee came into the house.  And you know, in the Caribbean--in this case, it was in Guyana.  You always have these mosquito nets around.  And he ran under there and called out for the ladies in the house to go kill this bee.  And that made an impression upon me.  I said, you know, I don't want to be a man like this.  So, and that I see very sort of clearly.  But I mean, there are other things in my dad.  He liked to tinkle with electronics, for reasons I did not understand.  He would take all these old radios and bring them back, and so forth.  And I did very early in my life as a teenager, started doing electronics too but not directly from my dad, indirectly from one of the Jesuit priests that I went to school with.  But because he had all of this electronic stuff, I did kind of, you know, steal a lot of things from him.  And you know, I went down to teach electronics for a long time and did consider doing my Ph.D. in that and so forth.  So, but other than that, there wasn't much, you know.  I'd see him a couple of times in a year.  We'd always have a pleasant meeting. His new wife, my stepmother lives in New York now.  She was always very nice.  I would say even up to now, we have some kind of relationship.  I visit.  They had two other children, so I have two--a half brother and a half sister there.  And I had two other sisters.  I have two sisters.  One of them died at a fairly young age. The other one lives in Barbados.  But I don't know.  You know, my mother, everybody says well, you know, my mother was a nerd and that's why I went in this direction in my life.  I think I'm probably anything but a nerd, but why I say there's not a lot of influence, she never even once in my life said, "Did you finish your homework?"  or, "Go do your homework."  It was always 100 percent up to me.  And, you know, we kind of figured out, you know, you have to do it.  It was the way forward in life, more or less.  But later on when, you know, when you started to appreciate how smart in academics she was and so forth.  And you know, I was surprised at that.  I think she was age fifty-four or so, when one of her friends dragged her to do the Mensa exam, you know.  And she just aced it out.  She made one of the highest numbers in the world.  And you know, she hadn't gone to college or anything like that.  So, she used to have a card for a long time, and I don't think she bothers with it anymore.  But she never imparted any of that feeling to us at all.  Maybe it was in the genes, but not said in any form or fashion, you know.  My mom, as I said, she was not a huggy, kissy mom, you know, in the house or so forth.  She knew it, and later in her life she, actually, I think was sort of proactive in trying to change that.  She went and did all kind of classes and courses about how to be that kind of person and that kind of mom, and go into her room and smile and laugh and so forth.  Before, she was all business--but always there for us.  But I really, you know, grew up with my grandmother and grandfather.
Story_ID: 24828
Speaker 1: Alright.  So, now did your parents [Jean Bacchus and Drysdale Morgan] split up like when you were a small child?
Speaker 2: I was six years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was six years old.  And I have, have two other sisters.  At that time, I think the youngest was one year old.  And I have a sister who is a year younger than me.
Speaker 1: Well, can you tell us about your siblings and just put yourself in the order.   Are you the eldest?
Speaker 2: I am the eldest, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  And you were born in '47 [1947]--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Then I have a sister who is a year younger.  She has now, as it stands, lived in Barbados for most of her life.  And I think it's true to say that for most of her most life, she has been a journalist.  She's worked for both newspapers in Barbados.  And she writes many columns about women and women's rights and, you know, I know she has some personal writing that she's spin off on stories and poetry and so forth.  But she has been mainly and fundamentally a writer, yeah.  And my youngest sister, I believe she was thirty years old or so, she was a flight attendant.  And she got murdered one Friday night.   She got strangled.  And it's actually the reason that I, in Trinidad, the reason that I came back to the U.S., one of the three reasons probably that I came back because when they, when she was found, she was still alive.  But when they called for the ambulance, they said we are out of gasoline tonight--in Trinidad, which produces so much gasoline for the world.  So, I said, well, I need a breather.
Speaker 1: So, she was murdered in Trinidad?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  But I was very close to her, the one that got murdered, extremely close, from the time she was small.  And so, it was kind of a tragedy, but you know--
Speaker 1: Did they ever find out who did it?
Speaker 2: No, I think that they were very, very, high suspicion that it was her boyfriend.  But the way the legal system works down there is a little different to here.  We would have had to be nearly present in Trinidad all the time, and be supporting it, and you know, in other words, the legal system doesn't work unless you push it, you know, whereas here in America it would work.  It would just go after who, whomever, you know, committed a crime here.
Speaker 1: Someone would have to be there prodding, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, all the time, yeah.
Speaker 1: --checking all the time (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: My mom [Jean Bacchus] tried it for awhile, but pretty soon it drained her bank account, and she just said, you know, just let it go, you know.
Story_ID: 24829
Speaker 1: Now, do you have an earliest childhood memory, earliest?
Speaker 2: My earliest memory is my third birthday party.  And I kind of remember it because, you know, people always would say you don't have memory much before that.  But I do remember my third birthday party.  And a huge cake, and for some reason, it had a lot of green and blue on it.  But that's my earliest memory.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I, you know, I started school at age three, and I remember that school.  I could go back there and drive to where the school was or something, I mean I--it's a firm memory.
Speaker 1: Now, what was the name of your school?
Speaker 2: I have no idea of what that was called--something kindergarten, I guess, but I'm sure it was named after the, this tough old lady that used to run it, you know.  But I can't remember the name.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 24830
Speaker 1: Now, can you describe where you lived?  Now, you were in Guyana until you were age twelve, right?
Speaker 2: I left in '61 [1961].  So, that would be fourteen.
Speaker 1: Fourteen, okay.
Speaker 2: Fourteen, yeah.
Speaker 1: Alright.  So, yeah, you were a teenager before you left Guyana--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and had moved to Trinidad?  So, where did you grow up in Guyana, basically--(simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Well, it depends where you think your formative life is.  I think of myself mostly as Trinidadian.  I think the teenage years, the early twenties, I just found like more formative, you know.  If I look now and say where are my ten best friends, they would be Trinidadians, not Guyanese, you know.   I think one of my friends, or a couple of them from Guyana remain very close friends today.  Probably my closest friend in those days is a chap called Bernard Freeman, who lives in New York.  And he always remained in my mind in my whole life because he came from a very rich family.  He was a white person from the Caribbean, but extremely rich family.  And every day after school when we'd go to get a little snack and a soda or something, he would pay, and never, ever once made me feel bad about it.  It was just like natural.  And three years ago, he found me.  I had looked for him a couple of times, 'cause I knew he had gone to Montreal [Canada], and I couldn't get to him.  But he found me, and since then we have rekindled some of that lost time.  It was really a very close friendship which, you know, you can't easily forget, just straight from his heart, you know, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  His name is Freeman, or his last name--
Speaker 2: Yes, Bernard Freeman, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Story_ID: 24831
Speaker 1: Can you describe, I guess growing up Guyana first, and then we try to be chronological, you know--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --as we approach this, but tell us, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, if we start going back to, I think you have an age six there, a couple of things I would say around that time in--I was a very outdoors person.  I was hardly ever in the house after school or on vacation.  I used to design little boats to sail in these small, what we call trenches there, or you might call them, man-made rivers or something.  And we'd race them.  I even came up with a design for one that would be a submarine, that I put two little fins on it, two sides of it and angle it like that.  And then when you propel it, it was a rubber band with a little propeller, it would go down.  I was always outside, shooting a slingshot.  Then, you know, later on with a pellet gun and so forth, fishing, something.  That was basically what I did.  I went to a lot of different schools, for reasons that are not clear to me.  It's not like I was any military family moving around.  But, I don't know.  If I have to count it, six or eight schools in my whole life I went to.  But the first one at age six was a Methodist school in the neighborhood.  And it always struck me how many people, not myself, but how many people at age six, most people were going to school barefoot, you know.  But luckily, I always had sneakers then, and you--always was by the famous Indian company called Bata, B-A-T-A.  We always had these Bata sneakers.  But the other thing I remember about a school is, you know, there used to be a bully beating me up every day.  Many days, he would beat me until I'd fall into the, the little river or the trench.  And then one afternoon--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: So really, really beat you?
Speaker 2: Beat me, like terrible, man, yeah.  And one day, an older gentleman saw what was going on, and came off his bicycle and took off his belt, and he gave that guy such a whipping.  You know, it was kind of the old days where any elderly person could, you know, give you a whipping on their own.  (laughter).  And then you'd get a second one when you go home.  And that stopped it, that stopped it.  The guy just came off his bicycle and took care of it.  That stopped it.  But it was definitely a very outdoorsy kind of life.  You know, you would think of somebody maybe in a small town in the Midwest, and that kind of, always outside, not inside.  And I was always making a lot of little things, making kites, you know, all these boats and everything.  We'd make them ourselves.

Speaker 1: Now, most people watching this would have no idea what Guyana looks like.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And it's located on the northern coast of South America across from the Caribbean, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's, it's between Venezuela on the West, and Dutch Guyana and Surinam on the East, and Brazil to the South.  It's a reasonably big country.  I think it's always been fairly poor, and still is today.  But it's the only English speaking country in the Caribbean.  And of course, the only fame it has in America is that that's where the Jim Jones suicide took place.
Speaker 1: Right, the Reverend Jim Jones.
Speaker 2: Reverend Jim Jones, yes, but their only--
Speaker 1: --who took a colony from--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: The great faith that it has, yes.
Speaker 1: --from his congregation--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --found a town, a little town there.
Speaker 2: But it's--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: That was in '78 [1978], '78[1978], '79 [1979]?
Speaker 2: It could be about that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: There's a very sort of interesting part of my life that is related to this question you asked about Guyana.  Guyana is basically nearly all jungle.  And the coastline of it, and it runs East to West, most of it has these large sea walls.  And they were built by, you know, the Dutch people.  They occupied Guyana for a long time.  Many of the sugar estates and so have Dutch names.  And they made these, it's a Dutch name, they call it de coca [ph.], where, you know, it raises up and water goes out, and at high tide it closes down, a dike.  And where I was born is, you know, is a street and a half away from the seaside.  But the rest of the country really is just dense, you know, Amazon jungle.  And because my life was always in the outdoor, always with guns and whatever else, you know.  At age thirteen in the summer, I went to my mom [Jean Bacchus] and grandmother who were in the kitchen, and I said, "You know what, I think I'm gonna take a walk this summer to Brazil.  It'll take me about two months to go and come back."  And to my amazement, they turned to me and said, "Just be careful."  And I did it.  I didn't really, you know, at the time, think of it that way.  But as my life has gone on, I think that may have put a certain type of strength and discipline into me.   You know, it's like somebody going into the Marines or something because it was so scary at night--
Speaker 1: How old were you then?
Speaker 2: I was thirteen.
Speaker 1: Thirteen, okay.
Speaker 2: It was so scary at night, you know.  The days were okay.  But in the night out there, I don't care what age you are, but okay, I'm thirteen, you know, and you know, all kinds of things are lurking around and moving around.  Of course, you know, I'm out there for two months.  There's no cell phone, there's no GPS.  You can't carry the food with you.  You have either to shoot something or catch a fish, or something like that.  In a funny way, what it probably taught me is that I could do anything, in a strange, strange way.  I didn't think of it like that, I just went for the adventure.  If you ask me now, I think it was a very stupid thing to do (laughter).  You know, I wouldn't recommend it to my son or to anyone.  But, and I think the reason my mother and grandmother answered that way, is they sort of knew I was capable of doing it.  I'll tell you a little side story to that.  They once talked me into going to join the [Boy] Scouts.  And I lasted one week.  As far as I know, I'm the only person got kicked out of the Scouts in one week.  I was too rebellious.  I didn't want to obey all these rules in the Scouts.  But then later on, when I became sort of versatile at things in the bush or the jungle as you wanna call it, I used to take time out to train these little Scouts in where to pitch a tent, where not to pitch it and so forth, you know, and doing various things out there, and hunting and cooking, and what trees to look at, you know.  What you can eat, what you can't eat, and whatever.  So, I kind of went around full circle.  But I did get expelled (laughter).
Story_ID: 24833
Speaker 1: I'm kind of curious as to the kind of thing you would have to negotiate to walk from Georgetown [Guyana] to Brazil.
Speaker 2: Well, I'd say, you know, geographically, in terms of getting lost, it wasn't particularly hard.  I did take a boat, it's about forty miles or so up the Demerara River, and just started walking on a trail that went dead South, I mean it kind of goes like that.  And every day you would meet maybe one of the local Indians, and they're called Amerindians, in South America.
Speaker 1: Well, so, you took a real remote route.  You didn't take like a road where--
Speaker 2: Well, there's no road, there's no road.  There is a road now.  There was never a road then.  No, no, this is strict, really jungle.  I mean, you could not drive it in a four-wheel drive in my opinion, then.  And, in fact, the nights are very dangerous, but what was also very dangerous is crossing rivers because in that part of South America, you have a lot of this piranha that you see a lot in the movies.  And you also have electric eels in there.  So, crossing the river, you always try to find a part that's very small that you could get over, and so forth, you know.  But you saw, as I said, the Amerindians never really--you would just pass on a little trail and there's this, and your gun.  One night a group did take me into their village.  Again, kind of a, somewhat an unusual experience.   And you know, I had a nice meal, I must say, compared to what I usually eat (laughter).  And then they, everybody sat around the fire, and you had to drink a little bit of alcohol.  But the way the alcohol was made, it was made in big clay cauldrons like this, and to ferment it, they would spit into it.  The saliva did the fermentation.  And that was generally the old people--well, none of them had good oral hygiene, the old people.  And you had to, you had to drink this.  And they would have a thing we call a calabash.  It's a gourd.  They just take off the scum, take out some, drink, and I drank it.  And I was hoping the alcohol would kill everything.  But after that, the chief decided he was going to honor me with his youngest wife, and that I should spend the night with his youngest wife.  And it was a lot of hard negotiation to get them not to force me into doing that.  But it was a good adventure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A good adventure.  One aspect of it, I think, stays with me up to today.  In fact last month they had to do one of these, you know, they call them the sleep studies on me.  I don't sleep well up to now.  And I'm such a light sleeper.  When I travel, you know, we do so much traveling in this job now, that any part of the world, I never ask for a wakeup call.  I wake up every fifteen minutes, twenty minutes.  And it's because of spending so much time in the--.  I thought I would grow out of it eventually.  And a lot of military people suffer from it, from having to stay up so much, you know.  But it's still with me.  And you know, the slightest thing I can hear, and wake me up, you know.  So, they're trying to see what they can do for me to let me have a better night's sleep (laughter).  But it's been like this all my life.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's quite an adventure, though.  This is like 1962 or so?
Speaker 2: No, it would be 1960.
Speaker 1: '60 [1960], okay.
Speaker 2: '60 [1960], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The summer of '60 [1960], yeah. .
Speaker 1: Summer of 1960, okay.  So, it took you two months to get to Brazil?
Speaker 2: I walked for one month.  And I didn't, I mean I just, let me say, I didn't go far into Brazil, and a month to come back.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. I mean a couple of the turns where I thought coming back I might have trouble, you know.  It's sort of standard in that part of the world, you just take your machete and you mark a tree.  And that's your mark when you're returning, you know, and although you have to be careful because after a month in that environment, it doesn't look any more like a fresh cut.  It looks very different.  You have to be careful, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 24834
Speaker 1: So, while you're growing up, your parents [Jean Bacchus and Drysdale Morgan] worked for this radio station.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And did they break up while they were working at the station together or--?
Speaker 2: Well, I was six then, but I'd have to say yes.  I think both of them were working at the same radio station at that time, yeah.
Speaker 1: Your father was an announcer.  He was on the air?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And your mother handled the business of the station?
Speaker 2: No, most of the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: She wrote the--
Speaker 2: She wrote most of the advertising stuff because, you know, as I said, she was this wizard English.  She wrote most of that for, you know, or what people have to read and so forth.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the name of the station, the call letters?
Speaker 2: I think it was called Radio Demerara. Yeah, Radio Demerara, yeah.
Speaker 1: Alright.  Now, in school, you say you were in quite a few schools growing up.  But from what you're describing, I'm trying to get a picture of how the school system was.  Were there public schools in Guyana in those days?
Speaker 2: There were public and private.  I think when I was young--six, eight, and so, I said I don't know why they move me around the two or three of them.  I guess all of the people must have had a discussion, this school is better than that.  They were all public schools.  And then I started off, maybe I was age ten or something at the time, going to the, a Catholic school, Sacred Heart School.  And I can't tell you if that was private or public at the time.  It may have been public, although it was 100 percent Catholic run.
Speaker 1: Okay, Sacred Heart School.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then that, you know, took you up to where you have to take a qualifying exam to go on to high school.  And for boys at that time, there were two outstanding schools, I think, that probably still are among the most outstanding schools in the Caribbean.  One was a Jesuit college, Saint Stanislaus, and the other one was Queens Royal College or just Queens College, I think, not Royal--that's the one in Trinidad, Queen's College.  And so I went to the Jesuit college after that.
Speaker 1: So, this is Saint Stanislaus?
Speaker 2: Yes, Saint Stanislaus, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  So, it's called Saint Stanislaus College?
Speaker 2: College, yes, it's called college.
Speaker 1: And it's what we would consider a high school?
Speaker 2: High school.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  So, you were like age, are you twelve or thirteen?
Speaker 2: You take it about twelve; eleven, twelve.  But then I left in '61 [1961] to go to Trinidad where my mother went to work at a different radio station over there.  That's how I ended up in Trinidad.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 24835
Speaker 1: Now, before we get you in Trinidad, now, so, you lived with your grandparents?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, I suppose a lot of things that you modeled or learned, were from your grandparents, growing up, I guess?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  That's a similar question you asked about my parents.  You know, the first thing that comes to my mind is to tell you that I believe a lot of my life, I have invented myself.  But I do see in the situation of my parents or my grandparents or so, I do see some things that you carry with you.  But I can't say, you know, it's like you see a lot.  But I do see odd things like, I do see for my grandfather was such a, I think because he was this cashier, he was such a honest disciplinarian kind of person, you know.  I remember one day, picking up what would be a quarter.  It was called a shilling, twenty-four cents, at home to go buy a Cadbury's chocolate.  And when he found out, that guy whipped me for one hour.  But it, you see, it left a mark on you.  And a similar mark from the Jesuit high school [Saint Stanislaus College], too, that you just could never commit a crime.  You couldn't even think about it, because it was just like in your soul, in your spirit, that you couldn't do these things, you know.  But I feel for my grandfather.  Yeah, some of that, you know, he wasn't a rich person.  We weren't rich by any chance.  We were probably lower middle class kind of.  But he provided well, and he gave you the idea that--which is something I do carry with me up to today in my life--that every single person in this world has a place, you know.  I tell my students often.  I say, you know, this academic stuff is just like one thing you can do.  This is one job.  But everybody out there is important.  And I saw that a lot in him.  He knew that this was going to be his narrow life, and he lived it very well.  You know, he wasn't trying to do this over here, or this over here, do this.  He did this, and he did it very well, you know.  My grandmother had much more of a flair for life and, you know, I think, good things, like, for example, she taught me to cook when I was very young, and I still love to cook.  I think I'm a very good cook.  But I learned that from her.  And she had much more of a tendency to give me freedom than my grandfather.  Had I asked him about going for the walk in the Amazon jungle (laughter), I knew what the answer would be, to lock me in the room (laughter).  But she had a different view about it.  I--they kind of balanced each other quite well.  They balanced each other quite well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 24836
Speaker 1: Okay, so, in, when you moved to Trinidad with your mother [Jean Bacchus], your grandparents are left behind in Guyana?  And--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: They--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Now, did you experience, I'm sorry, what were some of the changes going on in Guyana before you left?  I know that it was a British colony when you were born and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, there was, you know, some serious, I don't want to say there's a coup d'etat or something, but there were some serious uprisings.  I'm not sure, if it's '60 [1960] or '59 [1959], or something like that.  But it was some very serious uprisings.  And, you know, people were shooting each other.  A lot of people had died.  A lot of the city was burned down.  And I think partly because of that--and the plan was always for my mom, once she was settled in, to get us to Trinidad.  You know, it's like how a lot of people in the world today would be happy to come to America as a promise of a better place.  I think Trinidad was always looked at as a better place than Guyana.  You know, it had a better economy.  It had better, just general way of life, and so forth.  So, it was a plan, but I think that kind of forced us a bit in that direction.
Story_ID: 24837
Speaker 1: Alright.  So, you moved to Trinidad.  You're age, you're twelve-, eleven, twelve or so?
Speaker 2: I think probably fourteen.
Speaker 1: Fourteen, okay, fourteen years old.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Alright.  And, now where did you go to school in Trinidad?
Speaker 2: Well, before we get to the school--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --since we're gonna to stick on education, there was a clear understanding when we left Guyana to go to Trinidad that, you know, I was in this Jesuit College.  My sister was in, my two sisters were in convents, that when we get to Trinidad we would have a transfer to the sort of equivalent colleges in Trinidad.  And that did not happen.  And it was a lot of confusion with it, but in the end we had to become citizens first before we could go to school.  And that took two years to happen.  And in the interim, I really did nothing but walk the streets.  I hung out a lot with a very famous Trinidad steel band even up to today, called the Renegades.  I think they are one of the two best steel bands of Trinidad, Desperadoes and Renegades.  And the name can tell you in those days what used to happen was a lot of serious fighting with each other.  Of course, it's good to say that those days have ended, that the steel band has now become something of an international instrument of the century, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, was the whole steel band phenomena like associated with gang activity or something?
Speaker 2: It, it originally was associated with--I don't think anybody ever, maybe used the words in those days.  When you look back upon it, they were definitely gangs associated with it.  It was a low-class thing.  It was very low-class.  Very few respectable, I wouldn't say zero, but very few respectable people got involved with steel bands.  And so, in the early days of Carnival, if two of them are coming down a main street like this in Port of Spain [capital city of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago], everyone would start running, because they would really clashing.
Speaker 1: So this sounds similar to the Mardi Gras groups in New Orleans [Louisiana], the Wild Tchoupitoulas or the Zulus--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And when they get together, they, you know, have friction.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And your community members are part of these different groups.  So, would that be the case then?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: It wouldn't just be steel band members.  It would be--
Speaker 2: No, no, they have big things they push along, with drinks in it, but usually weapons in the bottom--
Speaker 1: But if you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --and everyone from the community--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Part of the Renegade is like being a part of a subgroup of, or subculture.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, I lived more or less, I don't even wanna say next door, but let's say next door to where they were centered.  So, I just kind of became a part of that for a while, and--.
Story_ID: 24838
Speaker 1: And after two years [after arriving in Trinidad in 1961], when my sister got into the convent, they sent me to take a test at Saint Mary's College, which I took and made a 100 percent, and they still didn't take me to the school.  So, I then went to a small college that had just started.  I was in the first class.  And it was, you know, compared to my Jesuit college [Saint Stanislaus College in Georgetown, Guyana], at any rate, you know, really just a place to keep you out of trouble.  It wasn't really of any high academic standards.  It was Saint Joseph's College, in St. Joseph [oldest city in Trinidad and Tobago].  That's why it was called that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I did my ordinary levels [O Levels] there, and then I went to something called the Trinidad Polytechnic Institute for my A [advanced] levels.  The instruction was so bad that every single person failed every single subject there (laughter).  And at least in your despair, you know, everybody had done the same (laughter).  And--
Speaker 2: Now, is this--I've heard that in the British system, at a certain age or certain point in the system, you choose to go on to higher education or you choose either a technical course or a more social science oriented course.
Speaker 1: Well, what happened is that you have the ordinary levels and the advance levels.  Most people, if you get a good education, you'll get to the ordinary levels.  And then a lot of people will leave at that time and maybe go work in the government or so for their whole life.  It's a good education, okay.  Today there is some people who are leaving before they get to the ordinary levels, and (unclear) to go the way of, you know, learning something technical.  But if you go on to the advance level, which is an additional two years, mostly you're expected, you're gonna go on to university.  So, when--, this polytechnic Institute that I went to was a place that just did A levels.  And it was a very interesting two years of my life in terms of some of the people I met and so forth.  And one of the teachers there, I would say who was probably instrumental in my becoming--I think up to today I'm a fairly good writer, from what people tell me.  His name was Rudy Pinkert, very well known in Trinidad, and subsequently very well known--we were talking about Carnival.  He became very well known in the Carnival arena.  But he used to teach us writing.  And every day he would come in and he would write a topic on the board.  For example, he might say "American football."  And you had three minutes to write about this.  And then he would go around the class and ask you what you wrote.  And he kept nothing barred.  If it was nonsense, you would be embarrassed.  And it was a mixed school, boys and girls.  You would be so embarrassed in there that you didn't even want to get up.  But what it did for you--he did this every single day for a year.  When you had something to write on your own, you immediately got to it.  You immediately got to what's the really important thing to say about this, instead of all the other nonsense you could think about.  And that was a very, very good experience in terms of learning how to write, how to throw away the nonsense and so forth.  But in that school, I was, at the end of it, when we all failed everything, I went back to the principal of the school and I said, look you know, I really wanna do science.  I hadn't, wasn't doing science up to then.  I had done some science at this St. Joseph's College, but it wasn't challenging.  And when I was back in Guyana I did do science.  I left in the third form. And he said, "Look, you know, you're very good at literature and history.  That's where we expect you to continue in the university."  And I said, "Look, give me the chance to come back to school to do the science."  And I came back, and in the first year, this is the year we all failed.  So, I didn't know what to do at that point.  I was trying mathematics and physics and chemistry.  And an uncle of mine--my mother [Jean Bacchus] has two brothers.  One of them is a mathematician, and he is the closest in age to me.  Although he's older than me, we grew up together, Ronald Bacchus.  He lives in, he's retired now, he lives in Port Antonio, Jamaica.  He said, "Why don't you go back to Saint Stanislaus College in Guyana because you're never gonna get an education like that."  And I said, "But how am I going to get in there at this late stage in my life?"  I was nineteen years old at time, and hadn't--, still in high school.  And I went back to Saint Stanislaus College with his help.  I lived with him and his brother who was in Guyana at the time, Malcolm Bacchus.  And I spent one year back at Saint Stanislaus, and that's where I finished my high school.  I graduated from high school at age twenty, because of this, trying to get to do science.  But that takes us back to Guyana.
Story_ID: 24839
Speaker 1: As I said, there was some interesting spare time in Trinidad before that [Morgan re-started his high school education at St. Joseph's College in Trinidad two years after he arrived there in 1961], on the streets with guys and so forth.  I learned a lot about the streets in those years.  I think it was actually, it stayed well with me over life that it doesn't matter what I do, or people tell me, I'm your professor at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], you know, I can go down into Roxbury [Massachusetts] on the street corner and be one of those guys. And, you know, in a genuine way, it's nothing made up, you know.  So, but we should go to is this last year of high school because in terms of what has happened to me subsequently in life--there is a very nice story about when I went into the school because of the way my uncle got me to get in school there.  I was one week late.  And when I got in, it was the mathematics class.  And we sat two, two in the class.  When I sat down, nothing happened in the class.  The priest would just sit down there.  So, I nudged the guy next to me, and I said, "What's happening?"  And he says, "He doesn't teach you, you know."  "What do you mean, he doesn't teach me?"  He said, "No," he said, "And next Monday morning we have an exam in something called Moments of Inertia, and you just have to study for it."  So, I sat back.  I said, this is very different than what I was experiencing in Trinidad.  After about fifteen minutes, he came down to me and he said, "Mr. Morgan, I want to welcome you to the class.  Everyone, this is Mr. Morgan" and so, so, so.  He says, "Let me see the book you're using."  And he took my book, which I had brought from Trinidad where I'd spent one year and we all failed.  He looked at the book just like this.  He said, "You can't get an A with this book.  You might get a B, but think about a C when you're using this book."  Okay, I said, "So, Father, what book should I use?"  Now, "Hold on."  And so, he went to some other student.  He got a book, and he said, "This is the book you need to buy, and with this you can get an A."  So, I said, "Okay, thank you, Father."  I said, "I understand next Monday morning we have this exam, Moments of Inertia."  He said, "Yes."  I said, "Well, could you give me an idea of some problems to work on in preparation for it, you know, as I just came here."  And he was very puzzled by this.  He said, "Oh, you mean you want me to tell you like number 3, number 7, number 9?"  I said "Yes, that's normally how it is."  Shook his head, he said, "Well, let me answer you this way.  This book has 4,234 problems in it," and walked away.  In other words, you have to do all.  And he turned.  When he got to his desk, he said, "Mr. Morgan.  Nothing is wrong with number 1, number 2, or any number.  That means you have to do all."  And he taught mathematics there for thirty-seven years.  And most of those years, our school, in a certain way, topped all the schools in the British Commonwealth, including England, because everybody in the class made 100 percent in all examinations.  I don't know all the years, but most of the years.  And he never taught.  It was a very interesting experience.  And he said, "You could use any book, any language, any level.  You know the subject."  It was such an intense year of learning, because you had to teach yourself.  Me and some of the guys from the class would go to the movies with our math book, and one piece of paper in it, we'll fold it--we unfold it before the movie starts, and we would do a problem because time was always running out, and we had these thousands of problems to do, you know.  I can remember with one friend, we go a party one night and somehow no girls wanted to dance with us.  We went out to the car and we worked some problems; we come back in.  And he had a rule.  He said, "After fifty hours, you could come to my desk, and I'll give you help, a hint, but I will not work it for you."  And he says, if it's forty hours, I will know.  By, that guy really used to know.  So your mind--sometimes I would jump up out of bed two or three [o'clock] in the morning, "Ah, I think I got that one."  (Whispering, unclear).  You didn't get it so you try it again.  When I left Guyana, came back now to Trinidad--, and I entered the university in a very funny way, I'll tell you in a moment--.  But when I went into university, I didn't realize at that time, but I was a very different individual to the other people in class with me.  I did not need a professor.  I did not need a lecturer.  Only in so far as to give me the boundary conditions of well, this is what we're doing in this class, this is what we're not doing because I already knew who had to do the work.  It was me.  It was no one else.  I think looking back, it was a major turning point in my life in terms of academia.  And it's true to say that nearly everyone in that class--because my friend I told you about, Bernard Freeman in New York, he keeps good track of everyone.  Nearly everyone in that class has been so really successful in different things in life, you know, from writers to, you know, accountants, to scientists, different things.  But the message is you've got to do the work if you want to learn the stuff, you know.
Story_ID: 24840
Speaker 1: But I came back [after graduating from high school in St. Stanislaus College in Guyana] to Trinidad and I took a little job at the same small school.  I wasn't so good teaching mathematics.  And we had a family friend that came to visit and he, he said, "Look, why are you not at university?"  And I said, "Ah, it's too much work.  I don't wanna go there, but if you can get me in, I'll go there."  And, 'cause I knew it was November already.  The next day he called, and he said "I got you in."  And that's how I ended up going to university.  It was not planned (laughter)
Speaker 2: Now, let me go back a little bit here.  What was your math teacher's name?
Speaker 1: His name was Father Lynch, L-Y-N-C-H.  We all called him Jiggle.  I'm not too sure--you know, there was this cartoon with somebody called Jiggs or Jiggle, or Jiggs or something like that.  He kind of looked like that.  He was a little short.  But he was, he was an Irish and Jesuit priest.  But his name was Father Lynch, yes.
Speaker 2: And the way--did the way he taught influence the way you teach now?
Speaker 1: I think it does influence a lot, the way I teach.  But it's a question that has a second part to it because not really by design, you know.  After all my undergraduate and everything and so forth, when I came to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], the person who was my advisor here, Professor Ted Madden, who spent his whole life at MIT, believe it or not, he had the exact same system.  And, you know, you cry every day, you, whatever it is, but he had exactly the same system.  And I think the two things together have influenced a lot of how I teach regular classes.  I deal with graduate students.  Many of them complain that I am too tough because I don't tell them the answer, don't tell them what to do, even if I know the answer because, you know, a lot of this is business, and a lot of, to do fundamental work, creative work, you have to do it on your own, or you don't get there.  So, I, it just, totally by chance I met up with another person like that, you know.
Story_ID: 24841
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, college.  Now, you're in college [in Trinidad] because somebody basically enrolled you.
Speaker 2: Basically, yeah.  Well, he was a professor there, family friend.
Speaker 1: But he was someone that knew your aptitude for math and what you were doing--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, he knew, he knew, he knew where I had gone to school [in Guyana] and so forth, and knew that I'd just come back from that.  And yeah, he was a professor of physics, which I ended up majoring in mathematics and physics.  His name was Imran McDoom (ph.), close family friend, still alive.  And that's how I ended up in college.  And I majored in math and physics.  And it was mostly a time, honestly, of partying and drinking.  I think the group of us, we must have had a lot of talent in some different way because we always seemed to pull through at the exams and so forth.
Speaker 1: Now, this is the University of West Indies?
Speaker 2: University of West Indies in Trinidad, St. Augustine, Trinidad.  But we really, really, literally, Monday to Sunday, partied.  And so, and then just before I graduated in my third year in June, the head of the department, sort of one of my mentors in physics, Dr. Fletcher, he called me in his office and he said, "Dale, we wanna make an offer to you which is unusual.  We know you're planning to go and teach high school."  And I said "Yeah."  And he said, "Well, we don't want you to go back to--, want you to stay here.  And we would like to give you a job as an assistant lecturer," which is like an assistant professor here.  So, here I was, I didn't even, you know, I was just getting my degree at age twenty-three, and he was offering me a job to lecture.  And I was hesitant about it, but you know, when he pointed out to me that he needed somebody to teach electronics and there wasn't another person as good as myself around, I agreed to do.  So, I took that job, and while doing that I started a master's degree in theoretical quantum physics.  And so, my master's thesis was in quantum, something called group theory physics.
Speaker 1: Now, the title of your thesis was, and we have it here.  I know I read it somewhere, but I don't see it here.
Speaker 2: You mean my Ph.D. or my Master's [degree]?
Speaker 1: Your master's, yeah--
Speaker 2: I don't know, it's some, it may be something like 'Magnetic Symmetry in Nickel oxide and Cobalt oxide', or something like that.
Speaker 1: Right, right (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It's some, yeah, (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --yeah, I remember reading, yeah, right.
Speaker 2: But, you know, I was teaching electronics at the same time.  The two didn't go hand in hand, and I eventually gave up both of them and changed to geophysics.
Story_ID: 24842
Speaker 1: Now, some of the professors who influenced you, you know, you mentioned before in other presentations, Professor Kei Aki--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Professor William Brace, Professor Peter Molnar--.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Professor Gean Simmons--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Professor Nafi
Speaker 2: Toksoz
Speaker 1: --Toksoz
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's still here.  I don't know if he's at work today.  He's on this floor with me still.  He was the one that recruited me to come here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, he recruited me, yeah.
Speaker 1: But you met him at the University of West Indies, and--
Speaker 2: No, no, no, those are all MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] people.
Speaker 1: Oh, MIT people.
Speaker 2: Every one of them are MIT people there.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they had the wrong position on this outline.
Speaker 2: Yeah, all of them are MIT people, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all of these are MIT people.  Okay.  So, at the University of West Indies, who were some of your mentors there?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess the same guy who kind of got me in, [Imran] McDoom.  The head of the department, Dr. Fletcher.  There was a, the mathematics professor who is in Puerto Rico now, trying to remember his last name.  He has an Indian, a very simple Indian name.  And I can't remember.  I think he was quite influential on us in mathematics.  A Jamaican guy, David Owens, was very in--Owens was very (unclear) in mathematics.  So, but it was mostly a time for partying.  Until we got to our master's [degree], you know, this, doing theoretical quantum physics, it's a pretty difficult endeavor.  And my advisor then was an Indian guy, Joshua, Sunny Joshua, and very pleasant guy to work with, not really as difficult as my Jesuit priest [Father Lynch at St. Stanislaus College, Guyana] or my advisor here [Ted Madden at MIT], (laughter) more straightforward.  But it went very well, the master's, and then I started to look around to make a change.
Story_ID: 24843
Speaker 1: Now, kind of explain to us.  What is theoretical solid state physics, for those who may not know?
Speaker 2: Well, it's, it's really very high level mathematical physics.  But there are a lot of different branches of mathematical physics.  In quantum physics, or sometimes they may call it condensed matter physics, which is like solid state physics, it's mathematics applied to the quantum state of molecules and atoms and so forth.  So, it's very, very high level mathematics.  And most of the time the theory is way ahead of anything experimental.  And one of the reasons I got out of it too is I wanted to get my hands a little more dirty and not just do theory.  Sometimes, you know, you might even heard a couple of months ago, they have found some particle in Switzerland.
Speaker 1: Higgs boson.
Speaker 2: The Higgs--, yeah, but you know, that was by theoretical physics predicted so long ago.  So, one of the reasons for changing, and I looked at geophysics, was that it allows me to do mathematics, physics, chemistry, electronics, and computing.  Every day I can wake up and do a different thing in geophysics.  And that's my big attraction to it.
Speaker 1: Were you also motivated by practical reasons?
Speaker 2: Practical reasons, too, in the sense that it gets me outdoors.  I do a lot of field work, even up to today.  Now, a lot of my research is looking for water for people in some of the Caribbean islands who don't have enough drinking water.  But it kind of takes me for a look back, to, you know, as a young person, I was a lot in the outdoors.  But here, I could make a living out of it, you know, being in the outdoors and studying things at a fundamental level.
Speaker 1: Now, and I wondered if Guyana or Trinidad is threatened by some sort of geological problem, you know, seismic problem or, you know--
Speaker 2: Well, not Guyana, but Trinidad is in a seismic zone.  And it's a strange question you ask because I do have a unique distinction with regards to--you know, it's Trinidad and Tobago.  But I have a very unique distinction, that twice I have predicted a major earthquake in Tobago and told the government beforehand.  And it's unique in the sense that we can't predict earthquakes.  We really don't have the methodology around the world to do it.  And you know, I always joke and say if what we had done in Tobago-- I had done in Tobago, was done here, you know, you'd be on the front page of 'Time' and 'Newsweek' [magazines] or something.  But because it was done on a, for a small island, you know--but we actually, I actually did alert the government three days before.  They responded very well, all well-documented.  And then something like eight years or ten years later, I saw another storm like it, then the same thing.  So, I do get involved.  For the time that I went back to Trinidad after graduating from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], I did work in the seismic research unit there.  And one of the good parts of that job is we ran a, or still run the seismic unit, a seismic network in the whole Caribbean.  And because I was good at electronics, I used to go around and service them a lot.  So, I really got to know the Caribbean, working there in a very meaningful way.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 24844
Speaker 1: Alright.  Well, tell us how you made the transition from University of West Indies [Trinidad]--you'd finished your master's degree, to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean I was comfortable, doing well there.  And I had started my Ph.D. there with the same Sunny Joshua [Morgan's master's degree advisor] in another branch of theoretical physics called spin waves.  But I started to think I wanted to do something more hands on, might have more relevance to the Caribbean.  And the thing that cropped was geophysics.  It had cropped up early in my life.  When I had finished high school, I had gotten a fellowship fully paid to Colorado School of Mines to do geophysics.  But I wanted to do physics first. That's why I didn't take it up.  So, I went to the University of Toronto [Canada] for a summer to study with a very famous person in geophysics, Gordon West, to see if I would like geophysics.  And I spent three months with him and--
Speaker 1: Is this in 1974?
Speaker 2: This would be '75 [1975].
Speaker 1: '75 [1975].
Speaker 2: Summer of 1975, yes, yeah.  Between '70 [1970] and '75 [1975], I was a lecturer in electronics and doing my master's in Trinidad.  But the summer of '75 [1975] I went to Toronto [Canada], did this.
Speaker 1: Dr. Gordon West.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And then I said--well, no, you're right-- it might be the summer of '74 [1974] because '75 [1975] is when I came back as a Ph.D. student.  It might be the summer of '74 [1974].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I decided I definitely wanted to do geophysics.  I applied for what is called the Commonwealth Scholarship.  It's famous scholarships that are given by Commonwealth countries.  And I got one to England and I got one to Toronto.  And it was kind of a hard decision between the two.  But at the last minute, one fellowship became available for all of South America, Central America, the Caribbean and the U.S., by the Organization of American States.  There was one fellowship offered to study for a Ph.D.  Well, I ended up applying for it.  I ended up winning the fellowship, which was a big surprise to me and then I had MIT--well, I shouldn't say had MIT.  They gave it to me on one condition, that I get into an American university.  And I had not applied to any American universities.  And the only place I ever applied to was, I sent my stuff to MIT.  And they immediately gave me admission, with or without the fellowship.  And that's how I ended up here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I was the first of this Organization of Americans--today they give out about twenty or thirty of them every year, but I was the first one.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, this is the OAS?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the OAS is responsible for getting me here. So, I had to give up on Canada and England.
Story_ID: 24845
Speaker 1: And I came here [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] to work with a long-standing professor here.  He spent his whole career there, Professor Theodore Madden, M-A-D-D-E-N.  And in my first interview with him, he said to me, he said, "Your mathematics is fine, your electronics is fine, your computing is fine, your chemistry is fine, your physics is fine.  But the thing you don't know anything about is your chemistry.  I'm going to give you chemistry for your Ph.D."  And I more or less went down on my knees and begged him not to, because I did not like that subject.  But that's what he gave me.  And I have to say after all that torture, I would--I mean I would go to his wife and hold her hands and cry (laughter).  I came out of it like a world class electro-chemist, where I have even been invited to open electro-chemical conferences.  It's also given me a perspective as a geophysicist about how chemistry affects geophysics, that very few people in the world have.  I would say there's one other French person that has a fairly good perspective on how electro-chemistry influences geophysics.  And it was really because of the way that he thought I should do this.  I was glad he didn't say biology because that was even less liked than the chemistry (laughter).  But his style, I mentioned it before, but to give you an example:  If I went in with six months work and I wrote up fifty, sixty pages, and I said--he always wanted us to call him by his first name, Ted.  And I said, "Ted, could you take a look at this for me?"  He said, "No, no, don't go anywhere, sit down."  And he would take it in real time and flip the pages.  And on a few pages, he would slow it down.  And then he would flip it again, and at the end would give it back to me and says, "You have three errors in there. Go."  He doesn't tell you the errors, he doesn't give you any hints of how to do it.  And by the time you reach your door, you're crying.  And that was Professor Ted Madden.  He's still alive.  He's not really too functional now.  But, you see, if you survived this guy, you were so mature.  You know, today most people when they get their Ph.D., if they wanna go on to academia, they do a post-doc [post-doctoral position].  None of his students ever took a post-doc.  It was kind of an irrelevant thing to us, because of the kind of training we have.  And it's not that different to that Jesuit priest (laughter) [Father Lynch at St. Stanislaus College, Guyana].  You had to do it on your own.  And, you know, I think, there are not a lot of people like that around because students complain these days if you treat them like that, you know.  They complain everywhere that, you know, they don't get help from the professors.  But that was not, I guess you could have fired him.  He was not going to change, you know.  Yeah, he was an old [U.S.] Marine, and up until a few years ago, he was still playing competitive ice hockey.  He was that kind of guy, yes (laughter).  So, I came here and, as a physicist mathematician mainly, and ended up doing something that was 90 percent chemistry, but applied to geophysics.  And when you come here, even today in the department, we tell you that you should leave in five years.  Most of our people are leaving in about seven.  But at the end of the fifth year, I was living in a (unclear) small apartment on that side of MIT's East Gate.  And there was a big snowstorm in January.  And I turned to my wife and I said, "You know what, I'm out of here."  And three weeks later I defended.  I hadn't even written a word as yet.  Three weeks later I defended, I was gone on the plane.  And I went back to the University of West Indies [Trinidad] to the seismic research unit.
Story_ID: 24846
Speaker 1: So, how did that, now, tell us about this now.  So you were here like five years basically.
Speaker 2: Right.  I left everyone that I met.  They told me five.  I did it, you know, and that was it.
Speaker 1: So at some point, you decided you were gonna get out of here?
Speaker 2: Yes, well, you know, later on, Professor [Theodore] Madden [Morgan's doctoral advisor] and I would then become more like friends than, you know, supervisor and student.  And he had a way that I did not know.  He would never tell you that you're ready.  If ten years or eleven years come, and you don't realize you're ready, you can leave.  He doesn't--at some point you have to realize, I'm mature enough.  I've read enough.  And, I--and you have to teach him something.  This was his attitude.  So, yeah, I just said, Ted, I'm writing my thesis and I'm out of here."  "Okay, if you wanna write it."  And I took one week to write it.  Five days in the library over there in Hayden.  And it's actually a little bit of a contention with me and the students.  I don't understand why they take so long to write these theses.  They want six months, nine months.  And I wrote mine in a week, you know.  I don't understand this writing thing on some of these.
Speaker 1: How many pages did you have to (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Each, it's about 100, it's not a long thesis, 135 or so.  But about half is mathematics and half is a lot of experimental work.  But the same thing happened, you know, on my master's thesis in Trinidad, I started writing it, a Friday evening like five o'clock, and I was done Sunday at five o'clock.  And it had no corrections to be made.  And so many students these days, they want six months, nine months, to get it all together.  And I say, my--just sit down and write the thing.  I don't really quite (laughter)--I think it's a different attitude towards writing, and life.  They get caught up in too much miscellaneous stuff and don't go straight, you know.  Like my students hear me say a lot that when you put up a dart board, they are happy if they throw the darts and hit the dart board.  And I am only happy if they hit the bull's eye.  Every time, you must aim for the bull's eye.  It doesn't matter what you do--whether you're opening a restaurant, a sandwich shop, you know, a cleaning company, hit the bull's eye.  That's what you should do.  But they are quite happy.  They say, "What are you fussing about, I hit the dart board." (laughter)
Story_ID: 24847
Speaker 1: Yeah, they say a lot of very bright people don't know how to really get their Ph.D.  They work on it and they never get it.
Speaker 2: Yes, that is true.
Speaker 1: Stories, even and since I've been on this campus the last couple of days, people have been (unclear) for years and never--
Speaker 2: That is true.  I mean I think the one case I personally know is that there was a very well-studied genius here at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] in mathematics.  And he never got his Ph.D.  But every so often he would come through the building and walk the floors and solve everybody's problems.  But he could never just like sit down and focus and do it, you know.  But quite incredible, I mean, guy, and, you know.  And he once wrote a little bit of a computer code for something called the Fast Fourier Transform at a coffee break in a seminar, over in mathematics.  And up to today, nobody can write it even with one comma less.  The most efficient code ever written for the Fast Fourier Transform.  But he never got his Ph.D.  Yeah, it happens, it happens.
Speaker 1: Now, who were some of the, were there any, now this is MIT, and there are stories that even trickle down to historians about geniuses, and you know, legendary minds here at this place.  I can think about Norbert Weiner--
Speaker 2: Norbert Weiner, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --and other people that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: are just great geniuses.  Do you have any stories about people like that?
Speaker 2: Well, not that I knew a lot of them personally.  But there's sort of a few things you learn from them collectively because I think, well, my advisor, Ted Madden, was one of those kind of people.  But what you learn from them collectively, is--well, I'll give you an example.  When I came from Trinidad here, because I was working in theoretical physics, mainly in something called group theory, looking at symmetries, one of the most famous papers on symmetries in the world was written by an MIT professor of physics.  So, I immediately, my first day I went to look for him.  And I showed him my paper, and so he was delighted to see it and so forth.  And then he said to me, he said, "But, you know, Mr. Morgan, I haven't done that work, this kind of work for over thirty years."  I said, "What?"  He said, "Yes, I mean I did something seminal.  It's a classic, but at MIT, we then move on.  We leave all the other thousands of papers to be written by other people."  And I've seen that here over and over so much, although you do see nowadays some components of people trying to do what we call, not first or second order or zero order problems, which is really what MIT should do, for the kinds of minds we have here.  It's really a special place to be.  Even talking to each other as colleagues, you know, everybody has such an immense respect for each other, 'cause you know, everyone is so good.  You know, in our department, to get an appointment--let's say we have an opening.  We don't advertise and fill it.  We might, we might not.  Sometimes, in one case I remember, seven years before we filled it.  What comes up, you have to be number one or number two in the world.  And if we're going after number two, it always comes up in the faculty meeting, why can't we get number one?  Well, sometimes the guy is married and the wife has a, you know, it's a two-body problem or something.  Okay, now let's talk about number two.  But this idea of not getting into the pack and doing what everybody else does, just to get another paper, just to get another five papers or ten papers, that is not really our quest at the institute.  It's better maybe to publish less but to write those really great papers.  But then these guys move on, you know.  And it is an amazing to see how these great people work.  Going to my advisor, Ted Madden, after I started to study all this electro-chemistry and decided to become an expert myself, one day in the library in the basement over there, I realized that maybe there's a guy who has become very famous for a sort of a diffusion thing onto an electrode.  And I said, but I think Professor Madden did this before this guy.  Well, I did my homework and I realized that Ted Madden had done this on one page in a report for the [U.S.] Air Force in 1957.  This guy had written this paper in 1967, one of the most famous papers in chemistry, the same result.  I go to Professor Madden, I said, "Ted, you know this, look at this paper.  This guy got very famous for this thing you did fifty--." "Ah, forget about that."  He didn't even think for about one minute for it.   You know, so, I think you see that a lot in, I mean, you know, you go to a guy like Norbert Weiner, you know.  Up to today we're still using the Weiner filters and in geophysics, particularly for a lot of the processing of oil field stuff and so forth.  And those filters are still used, you know.  But you see these examples.  In my own area, I teach a class here that my advisor used to teach for maybe forty years.  This is the notes of it, just sitting down here.  I call it 'Data and Models'.  So, any kind of data you have, I try to teach how to model it.  And it's a class, it started in this department, but I get people from every department now 'cause everybody looks at the data today.  But to your point, interesting story, in 1970, two guys here, and one from this department, one from mathematics, Bacchus and Gilbert.  And they wrote four papers about data and statistics.  And up to this day, people still read them and discover new things in them.  When they were finished with those four papers, both of them went on to different illustrious careers, never to look back.  But I think that's one principle you see in them, that they don't stick on the same thing and beat it to death for their whole life. You see a change in it, but they're both still alive.  They pass by every now and then, but they're doing something else, you know.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, like my advisor who would go to seminars every day.  He was a guy always learning himself.  Every day he would look up whatever seminars.  And he would look fast asleep in the lecture.  And at the end, he will put up his hand and ask something and everybody would be quiet, you know.  That's what I think, the old MIT and the great guys, they're very much like that.  One hopes that with all this, the way things are moving so fast now in some directions, you know, that we don't lose that.  There is a chance of losing it because some of the newer Ph.D.s might get educated a different way.  And that will start to be propagated, because I strongly believe and I think, in an old way, maybe it hasn't even been stated that what we should be doing here are the fundamental problems.  And once we make that breakthrough, then we do something else.  And I, myself, try to do that.  I try to change fairly often what I do.
Story_ID: 24848
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell us about your dissertation.  I don't think we talked about that in kind of depth, but--
Speaker 2: My dissertation was, I mean the subject is a rather simple subject.  And that is you are putting two electrodes down in some water with some salts in it.  And you're trying to run electricity through it.  And what is the process that takes place on and off the electrodes?  And it comes into play many different things, so it--you know, from corrosion.  All corrosion happens that way.  You're plating, electro-plating things or whatever that comes into.  In geophysics, we use it because in the minerals of rocks and the pores, when you're passing the electricity, what happens on the first twenty, fifty angstroms, very, very small.  Distance surface affects the electrical signal, and my quest in the lab was to try to get a model on equivalent circuits for that so that we can use when we go into the field and surface to see something about the rocks or depth.  The challenge was to explain two things:  This little, small zone on the surface, every material that's in contact with water has this little boundary, electro-chemical surface boundary.  It's actually what runs our, most of the electricity in our brain is run from that stuff in all of this mushy membranes of our brain.  Well, a rock is kind of like a membrane.  But one of the things is that the capacitance of that layer is what we measure.  And the people were measuring very high capacitances, higher than their constituents.  But when you put them to--somehow, it was getting very large.  And so, one thing that Ted Madden wanted me to do was to see if I could figure out what was happening.  Little did he tell me, he had tried for twenty-five years to break this problem.  He didn't tell me that then.  He just said, "You're gonna solve this problem." (laughter).  Then the second aspect of it was, he said, "When you solve this, when we go into the field, we can measure this capacitance as a function of the frequency, from low frequency to high frequency, and see whether that characteristic that you get can tell you if this is pyrite or cobaltite or iron or lead, because then we can use it from the surface to discriminate, and that would be very important for the mineral industry.  So, that's what my thesis was about.  I did solve the first part and figured out it was--well, everyone thinks of this charged area as being due to, you know, how to say, like things repel, and unlike attracts, just like electro-statics, just like electricity.  But it turned out the large capacitance had nothing to do with that.  It had to do with a chemical adsorption, which is a quantum mechanical effect.  See how things in life circle back on you, you know.  I never thought it would come back to something like that.  And so once we understood that it was the adsorption that was doing it, and then I went down to do the experiments to show that, that they were a distinct spectra for the various minerals.  So, today we can go out and discriminate.  The thesis, again, to my great surprise, because I left there three days after my Ph.D., it did win the best thesis in the department for that year.  And I got a little, a couple hundred dollars I remember, buying a camera with it or something.  But it was nice to come back and get it, you know.  You know, it made me feel good, you know.  I said, well, you come from the Caribbean.   You come here, you get done in five years, and at least you did something correct, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, it did well.
Story_ID: 24849
Speaker 1: What is interesting today, probably the most interesting piece of research I'm doing now, and arguably, maybe it's going to be the most interesting I'll do in my life, is the question of how earthquakes begin.  And the second question to that is, if you understand how they begin, maybe you will find a way of predicting--and of course, that's a big societal plus if you can do that.  Well, I think everyone agrees today who look at the earthquake source, prior to an event, that by some means, the pressure of the water in the pores is increasing.  Now, you see, you can take any rock, any material, if you increase that pressure in the pores, what's gonna happen?  The rock kind of explodes just from the pressure.  So, it weakens it.  So, everyone agrees, but no one agrees how this pressure is increasing, and they've got some really harebrained ideas that water is pumping underground from ten kilometers away, and all kinds of crazy stuff.  But I'm writing a paper today.  I don't know where I'll go as yet, whether to 'Nature' or 'Science' [prominent scientific journals], and it is probably over two decades in the making.  But it's to show in great detail the physics and chemistry of a method that causes this pressure to increase.  And it turns out to be mostly due to chemistry, but very, very, very, simple.  And you know, sometimes when you're right, when you see it's so simple, you know you got it right.  And this chemistry is ubiquitous, it's everywhere in the earth.  And so, I strongly believe that we're gonna come up, or I have come up with a good way of explaining how these earthquakes begin.  But, you see, most of us are seismologists, if I put on my seismology hat, I think of an earthquake as a mechanical thing.  So, I look at mechanical ways.  But what's happening is at the micro level, the mechanics is being influenced by the chemistry.  And you see, again, how funny it is.  It makes a full loop back to my professor [Morgan's doctoral advisor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)], Ted Madden, who said "Learn chemistry."  It wouldn't have been my choice.  It wasn't what I was good in.  But the fact he made me into a world-class electro-chemist, I can now look at the earthquake problem in a different way.
Story_ID: 24850
Speaker 1: So, 1975, after, when you finished your Ph.D., you went back.  Well, you finished in '81 [1981], I'm sorry, '81 [1981].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You went back to the University of West Indies [Trinidad].
Speaker 2: I did, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you taught geophysics or--
Speaker 2: I did teach geophysics.  But I worked in, mainly a research unit for seismology.  We monitored the volcanoes and the earthquake centers in the Caribbean.  So, it gave me a lot of chance to travel along to the Caribbean, and get to know it better.  But I did teach in the physics department then and, well, in many departments in mathematics and petroleum engineering and so forth.  It was something I'm kind of proud of.  If we, in fact go back before that to 1972--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I started in the physics department at the University of West Indies with two other colleagues, a program for the senior students in environmental geophysics.  At that time, the environmental word was not a buzz word at all.  And the program still runs up to today and graduating thirty to forty people every year.  So, I'm very proud that, you know, forty years ago I was instrumental, as a very young person then.  I was only, you know, twenty-four or twenty-five years old when we did this.  We had even a lot of objection, why you calling this thing "environmental" and so forth, you know, whereas today, nobody would ask you those questions.
Speaker 1: Well, what was the inspiration in those days?
Speaker 2: You know, basically, again, it might, you know, go back to my younger life.  I realized that there are a lot of things that geophysics can do, you know.  It's such a broad subject, you know.  You could study the atmosphere, you could study the oceans, you know, the earthquakes.  You could go looking for minerals, for pollution.  And so we put together a program in all those pieces.  The students taking it learn a piece of all of those things, looking for water and so forth.  We call it environmental--.  And there's some field work and lab work, environmental geophysics.  It's still going up to today.  So, when I went back in 1981, I went back to teaching some of that, you know, having started it, and glad to say it's still functioning.  And the other major thing that happened in my years there before I came back to the U.S., was the prediction of these two earthquakes in Tobago.  That happened while I was working at the seismic research unit, yeah.
Story_ID: 24851
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when did the first earthquake take place?
Speaker 2: It took place in 1985.  No, I take it back, '82, 1982.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, 1982 is one of them.  And then--
Speaker 2: The second one, I was not there at the time.  I was here.  It was 1998 when they just sent me the data to look at.  Yeah, that was 1998.
Speaker 1: Okay, 1998.  So, the government of Tobago, you know, responded well, and to--
Speaker 2: They responded very well.  It's one government, but--
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: When we called up in Trinidad, it was a Friday morning.  They were in parliamentary session.  But the Minister of Security under which this stuff falls, came out and spoke to me on the phone.  And he said "We will have a helicopter on your lawn in a half an hour."  And he personally was there in half an hour.  And then we flew by helicopter to Tobago.  And we put the medical, the military, all police, everyone had to come back from vacation and be on twenty-four hours.  And the earthquake happened on Monday at about, a little after noon.  So, that was an exciting thing to do. I mean, you know, for a while they used to call me the 'Earthquake Man' down there, which they've all forgotten by now (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, how did you, can you explain in layman's terms how you knew?
Speaker 2: How did I do it?
Speaker 1: Yeah, how did you know?
Speaker 2: Well, I'll explain it.  And it has a good side note for students, too.  At the time, in the seismic unit [seismic research unit at the University of West Indies in Trinidad], I worked with two other, let me say, equal colleagues.  They were both British scientists.  And both of them were on study leave in England.  So, I was the most senior person there.  And when we had this swarm of events in Tobago, we went over and set up extra seismic stations so we could monitor it very well.  Sometimes they would get a 100, 200 earthquakes in a day.  People were very scared.  But there's a very simple plot that you can make, of the number of earthquakes versus the magnitude.  And if you make that plot, it has a slope to it.  And one of the axes is a log, it doesn't matter.  But when--if you have a slope to it, that slope, that gradient, in geophysics we call it the "B value".  The first guy that did it used "B" for it, and we call it the "B value" up to now.  Well, people had had the idea that maybe if we look at the B value, we will see it changing in a region before a big earthquake.  But after a lot of really extensive research, everyone concluded that it was not possible to do it with the B value.  And some really great papers came out of some institutions in California and so forth.  So, what I did, was something I say to my students often--every time it gets a giggle out of them, "Don't read too much."  And they think this is funny coming from a professor, right, because they think a professor should tell them to read a lot.  Why do I tell them not to read too much?  Well, if you read a lot, guess what you do?  You do the next thing from the guy who just did the last thing.  You're hardly very original.  But if you take a blank piece of paper and say, "You know what, I know enough physics and mathematics and chemistry.  Here's a problem.  Can I solve it without going to Google [search engine], without trying to find all these papers to see who has solved it before.  One of these days you're going to create something new.  So, going back to this, I took this data, and I started to plot it on a daily basis for the whole storm.  And what I saw was that instead of taking one gradient for all the data, if I took two gradients, one for the large earthquakes and one for the small earthquakes, if I looked at the two gradients, I saw as time progressed, at the end, it looked--they were going to become one gradient but in between they were different.  And that allowed me to see that in that intermediate time, if you get a number of earthquakes of magnitudes, say four to four and a half, the only way that you can make one gradient to the end is to have a big earthquake, and then it has after-shocks, see.  And that was the method.  And the truth is if I had gone and read everything on the B value, what would I have done?  I'd never do that.
Speaker 1: So--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: But it was done, I mean I still have the original pieces of paper that (laughter), that I wrote down on, by hand, and that was the method.
Speaker 1: Now, what was the other value you used?  You used the B value, and what was the other one called?
Speaker 2: No, no, it, it, but I do it, there're two B values, I looked at two of them--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Oh, two B values.
Speaker 2: Yeah, for the large earthquakes and the small earthquakes.  And they had different values.  And I could use that in a way to do a prediction of what will happen because I made the assumption, at the end, at the end, we will have one B value, you see.  So, you have to kind of fill in, you know, so you can predict what you have to fill in with.  And I repeated it in 1998.  They had another storm there.  It turned out to be a very good prediction too.  And one of the younger people there and who is now the director of the seismic research unit, she did her Ph.D. on this topic for earthquakes in other parts of the world.  So, it continues as a subject here, yeah.  Nowadays it's a big area, actually, in geophysics.  But, you see, again, with my sort of thinking, I did what I had to do in it, in the early '80s [1980s].  And I just leave it now.  Other people can do it, you know.
Speaker 1: So, is this a generally recognized system for predicting--
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  I wouldn't say there is any generally recognized system today.   But what you do see is a lot of papers on people looking at the two slopes and trying to do--it's not even--I call it algebra--it's not even heavy mathematics--doing a lot of algebra about this, that and the other, and where to take this pivot point and so forth, you know.  But in terms of it being implemented, no.  We may implement here because it's one of the best data sets in the world for the earthquakes that happen in Turkey.  They have very, very major earthquakes and it's a very good data set.
Speaker 1: So, what you're saying too, that--I don't wanna let this to slip away, is that there are lots of small earthquakes going on all the time that we--those of us who don't have seismic equipment, don't know anything about?
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right, that's right.  Yeah.   But you know, to do the kind of prediction that we did there, you would have to have a lot of seismic stations, because you need to see the full behavior.  And there aren't many places on earth that that's so.  I mean, certainly, Southern California has, I don't know, a thousand or two thousand earthquake stations, you know, and Japan and parts of China.  But you need to have the stations, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now a station is a place, correct me if I'm wrong, just my layman's understanding of this is that a seismic station sends a sound wave, I think, from one station to the next to determine--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: No, for earthquakes, the sound wave comes from the earthquake.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And that comes through the ground.
Speaker 1: --electronically.
Speaker 2: And a station basically is a microphone that is coupled to the ground. That's all that it is, mainly.  It's nothing but a microphone coupled to the ground.
Speaker 1: So it picks up on the sound wave--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that's emitted by the earthquake--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: By the earthquake, and that has traveled there.
Speaker 1: Okay, right.  And I think it's, they measure the velocity of the sound--
Speaker 2: Well, you can measure three different movements for most of the seismometers in the whole world, the ones that make these magnitudes and so on, it is the velocity of the ground that they measure.  But you could measure displacement or acceleration also.  But most of them in the world are velocity.
Story_ID: 24852
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, in 1983, you came back to the U.S. to Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California].
Speaker 2: To Stanford, yeah.
Speaker 1: How did that take place?
Speaker 2: Well, after I had made up my mind to come back, I think I sent out eight or ten applications to different places, and in the end I got three job offers.  And I thought Stanford would be an exciting place to go to.  A lot of the faculty there had come from this department [geophysics; Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts (MIT)], you know, so I knew a number of them already.  And I went out there.  I associated myself mainly with a guy called Amos Nur, A-M-O-S, N-U-R.  And he had a very large group doing what is called rock physics, looking at the properties of rocks, various kinds.  And I worked very closely with him, started to teach my class on data and models there at Stanford first; taught a class on geothermal energy way back.  But something had happened in 1983 when I had sent out those applications.  One of the three places that had offered me a job was Texas A and M [University, College Station, Texas].  And I did actually go there, but, you know, the place was dreadful, dreadful place out there, you know.
Speaker 1: In what sense?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, for example in those days, there wasn't even a coffee shop, or a book shop.  And I said, my gosh, you know.  We were gonna drive to Houston and Austin [Texas] every weekend.
Speaker 1: Now this is College Station?
Speaker 2: College Station, Bryan, yeah.  Terrible.  So, I decided against it.  But, I don't know if you know the history of Texas A and M.  The college was actually only made into a normal university and coed [co-educational].  It used to be military, ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] only before.  But 1967, they made a change.  And they decided in good old Texas fashion, I guess, when they made that change, they were gonna escalate themselves into the top ten, any how you measure it.  So, they had money, and they made a plan that they were going to habitate the place with the individuals from around the world that they really wanted.  And so, if they found somebody they wanted to hire, they never let up.  That's a long way of saying that.  So, in chemistry there, I think they hired a number of Nobel laureates and so forth.  But they had to pay a lot of money to bring people there.  So, here I am at Stanford, every three months or at a scientific meeting, the head of the department or the dean would contact me.  "Dale, we still want you at A and M."  And they might discuss, you know, giving me more money for the lab.  Every time, they would increase the ante, as they say.  And eventually it got a point where it seemed like it would be a good academic move for me.  And then I did that.  And I have to say it was a very, very exciting time for me academically, in terms of things going on, the number of students and everything.  And so, I think in terms of day-to-day life, terrible, you know.  We would drive down to Houston just to have a dinner, you know, on Friday and Saturday night, you know (laughter).  But it was a wonderful place to work.  I often do think about it terms of, you know, diversity and racism and so on 'cause you know everybody here is Texas this, that and the other.  And I thought, it's not something I overly think a lot about, because in Trinidad we really don't fuss around too much with race.  But, it turns out, you know, I would say it has less racism than here in Boston [Massachusetts].  And that surprised me, you know.  And, you know, I definitely--it was a welcoming place, because they wanted to go places and do things, you know.  They were on the move.  And, it's always, you know, when you're recommending to a young person to take a job, say, take a job in a place that's on the move.  If you take it in a dead end place, you know you're not going anywhere.  And that's what A and M [Texas A and M] was at the time.
Story_ID: 24853
Speaker 1: Then one professor here, Professor Nafi Toksoz, who was one of my professors when I was a student [at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts (MIT)], he called me up one day at [Texas] A and M [University, College Station, Texas] and said, "Dale I would like to come and give some lectures at A and M."  And I said, "Sure, Nafi, I'll make some arrangements for you."  So, I made some arrangements for him to come for a week.  And he came.  He always gives good lectures, gave good lectures.  And then I was taking him back to the little airport in College Station, and he says to me, "Well, you know, Dale, you know I really didn't come here to give these lectures.  I came to spy on you."  And I said, "What do you mean by that?"  He says, "Well, I would like some, I would like you to come back to MIT."  And I was a little lost for words there because I didn't even wanna to come back and visit Boston [Massachusetts] after I left.  That place is too cold, it's too miserable.  And I knew MIT, and how much you have to work.  I mean, this is not a place you're gonna slouch around, you know.  And my, so I was quiet for a while and then I said, "But look, Nafi, you've got a lot of other better people you can choose but me."  And he said, "Well, look, Dale, I didn't come all this way, you know, and spend a whole week here."  He says, "You tell me somebody at the stage of your career, your age, in geophysics, who is better than you."  So, I thought for a while, and I mentioned a name, which I won't mention.  And he said, "Oh, yeah, that person is quite good.  You picked a good choice.  But he's not as good as you.  Okay, give me a second choice."  And it's funny because I don't think of myself that way.  But at that point, I realized he had me pinned.  I couldn't think of anybody else.  So I told him, "Okay, look, I'm going to think about this."  And subsequent to that, he had me come.  I gave a number of lectures, and not just one, but I gave a number of lectures.  And then they made an offer which, again, it took me a while to say yes to.  All of my colleagues down at A and M, said, come on, MIT giving you--well, the way it turned out--there's a funny little story with MIT in that they called me, I think, on a Friday.  And they said, "Dale, look, have you decided yet?  We're making you an associate professor, so, so, so."  And eventually, I told them, "Yes, okay, we're gonna decide to come."  And Monday morning they called me back to say they had another meeting, and they decided that it would be a waste of their time and my time to bring me in and then put me through the tenure process, because I already had so many papers and they had so many recommendations.  So, they decided over the weekend to make me the offer for full professor with tenure.  So that's how I ended up coming here, full professor with tenure.  And it was, the recruitment was Nafi Toksoz, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, so, this is--
Speaker 1: Ninety three [1993].
Speaker 2: 1993, okay.  You've been here ever since?
Speaker 1: Been here ever since, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 24854
Speaker 1: And well, just kind of walk us through the highlights of your career here [at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: I--it's probably true to say because of the way my life has gone, either by accident or by design, that I am the most broadly based geophysicist here.  So, you know, I can do seismology, I can do electro-magnetics, I can do rock physics, you know.  I can go--in any one of these areas, I can go into it.  So, what I did in coming here was to do a kind of an adaptation.  In fact, I changed completely from what I was doing before.  And I started doing all the electro-magnetics, all the electricity stuff, magnetic stuff.  And prior to that, I was doing all rock physics.  I still teach a very advanced class in rock physics.  But I don't do a lot of research in it.  I've done some research in it.  And maybe the hardest field in rock physics, while I was here, which is, you know, you talked a while ago about sending sound waves through a rock, and you learn something about it.  Well, you can send electro-magnetic waves through it too, and learn something.  Well, there's an area in which--you call it either electro-seismic, or seismo-electric--where if you send a seismic sound wave through the rock, it generates electricity, and you measure that.  So, you combine the two fields.  One of--, each one is hard enough (laughter).  But you combine the two wave fields, and you get some special things out of it.  So, I have done some very important work in that area.  Some of it's still under covers, for one of the oil companies and so.  But because of this breadth, I decided to fill in holes.  We have so many people doing seismology, I didn't want to go in there.  I did start to teach this modeling thing, which is very germane, not just to geophysics, but to geo-sciences.  It's equivalent of, you know, if you do a CAT scan or MRI, when they take the data, it goes into a huge computer program.  They take that data and give you the image you see.  Well, you could think of, in geophysics, that's what we do.  But we walk around on the surface, and we take the data and then we have to put it into a huge program like that and come up with the image of what's down there.  So, that's what I teach in this class.  So, that was an old traditional class at MIT which I've taken over.  It's done very, very well.  I also teach it in the summer for a week to professionals from, well, just about every discipline in life that you could think of.  I've had people take this class from cardboard box makers to military, to NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] to, you know, a lot of biomedical stuff, computing people, Google themselves, all kinds of people come through it.  It's a challenge, but it's also a nice thing because I have a class of people here, professionals, that never thought they would see other--people like that.  So, it's fun.  The hard part of it is there's always people in there who know more about the subject I'm teaching on any day than I do.  So, it's done very well, very successful class.  And you know, that's a, a little side thought came to me when I say I know there are people in there who know more than me on any given day about something.  As a good characteristic of MIT, as opposed to other universities, there's very little hierarchy at MIT.  When we have a problem to solve, the way we look at it is that the freshmen can solve it, maybe a graduate student, you know.  So, when we work together, especially in field work as a team, everyone, anyone can solve problems.  It's very unique in that way.  Even in our registration for classes here, there's not an issue even of cross registration.  Everybody registers for whatever they want anywhere on campus.  Most institutions do not operate that way.  Sometimes they say, no, you have to be in science, or you have to be in engineering.  We don't have those boundaries, which I think is a great thing.  So, I came in, and I had been in a lab that Professor [Nafi] Toksoz started, called the Earth Resources Lab.  I am still a part of that.  I am the associate director of it for a long time.  I can't remember how long.  And I was also instrumental in starting a large center at MIT with the country of Kuwait.  And it's called the, the Kuwait-MIT Center for Natural Resources in the Environment.  And I gave it up two years ago.  Another person is running it now, but it's a large thing, brings in very good funding from Kuwait, as you can expect.
Speaker 1: There's lots of oil in Kuwait, as we well know, and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, so, we've got a lot of things we do with them.
Speaker 1: How long, I mean what--did you spend like a portion of that every year in Kuwait?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, you know, first of all, writing the proposal and getting a group together and getting it done, that took about three years of work.  And then I mean it was obvious that I became the director.  And I did that for six years, and that was enough.  I had told them five, but after six, I gave it up.  And I think during that time, to answer you, I probably did nothing else (laughter).  It wasn't an easy thing to manage because, let me say, the mismatch, or the match, however you want to look at it, between a place like MIT and a very bureaucratic country like that, was not an easy thing, you know, you know.  At MIT we speak and think a way, and talk to people a different way, you know.  We can go to Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California] and we match immediately, you know.  But trying to make those two things come together, it basically took up all my time, you know.  So, I did that for a while.  There was another program in the department called Geo Systems, which we ran for a number of years, which I ran.  Today just recently we have a new head of department, Professor Rob van der Hilst.  Our department has four groups to it.  It has a space and planetary, it has an atmospheric and oceans, geology and geophysics.  And he has made me, I am now the chair of that geophysics group.  So, it keeps me busy trying to get everything in geophysics running, from the student things to, you know, the faculty searches, and so forth.
Story_ID: 24855
Speaker 1: Now, in 2006 you participated in the Eastern Caribbean Geothermal Energy Project, Geo-Caraibes.  Tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, my, the reason for my participation to begin with is that probably going back thirty years or more, I have been doing various measurements at various volcanoes with geothermal energy in mind.  I am interested in renewable energy as a subject.  Myself and Nafi Toksoz [Morgan's former professor and now, colleague at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, Massachusetts] actually, we have taught the oldest class on renewable energy at MIT, although everybody is crazy about it now.  We have been teaching it for so many years.  But the OAS [Organization of American States] put together a program where they wanted to look at three islands, St. Lucia, Dominica and Nevis, well Nevis/St. Kitts.  But, and they wanted to have the appropriate science done and so forth, before they made this into a business plan, to try to bring real geothermal developers.  And because of my knowledge in this, I was put together with two other people to look into it.  So, we didn't do much work in St. Lucia because most of the work I had already done.  So that existed.  In Dominica, very little bit, but most of it was done in Nevis.  And what can I say.  There are people drilling in Nives now for Geothermal.  I think St. Lucia might happen fairly soon.  And Dominica, I think they will probably hook up with the French because they're between Martinique and Guadalupe, but I think it will happen.  But it was a very productive venture.   And even from a scientific end, in Nevis, we actually invented a new geophysical method which, hopefully, we will patent soon.  We haven't put it out, publication yet.  But the guy who did it with me, who works for the USES [United States Environmental Services] now, he's coming on Friday for us to talk about finalizing that.  But we, kind of like crazy people invented a new method out in the field and it works so good, it's like unbelievable, unbelievable.
Speaker 1: Now Nevis is the home, many people don't know it was the home of Alexander Hamilton [one of the Founding Fathers of the United States; chief of staff to President George Washington]--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Alex--, yeah, yeah.   Yeah, we worked on a lot at Hamilton's estate.  Yeah, a lot of the work we did.  The geothermal area is, he may actually have a geothermal on his estate.  Yeah, so that was definitely one of our hunting grounds, yes.  A lot of people don't know that, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, the potential for this is that a lot of electricity could be generated using geothermal products--
Speaker 2: Well, for Nevis, and even if they generate ten megawatts or fifty megawatts, the ocean between Nevis and St. Kitts, it's, I think it is eight miles wide or something.  It's very--and thirty meters deep.  They will definitely put a cable across to St. Kitts.  So that will supply all of their electricity easily.  Dominica is the biggest potential of geothermal in the whole Caribbean, of all islands.  And the hope and plan eventually is that they will produce between a hundred and 200 megawatts.  And by undersea cable, send it to Martinique and Guadalupe.  And the French, every time it comes up, in words that were more or less agreed, if you guys can supply this, we will guarantee and buy it from you because both of them are very densely populated islands, compared, say to Dominica.  St. Lucia, I think, the hope is to get about twenty-five megawatts and use it in what we call the baseline transmission.  You know, wind and solar, they go on and off, on and off.  But something like geothermal, once you get it going, it just goes as a baseline.  And that's their hope to get that on line in St. Lucia.  Most of the other islands I would say, I mean Guadalupe has fifteen megawatts running.  Nothing in Martinique as yet.  But most of the other islands don't have good prospects.
Speaker 1: Okay, how do these islands, how were these islands generating electricity before?
Speaker 2: Well, all the electricity is mostly generated by diesel.  I think the French pushed renewables, as you know, you hear here in the U.S. like wind and solar and whatever, very much.  I think the island of Guadalupe, because it has fifteen megawatts from geothermal, I believe 40 percent of their electricity is from renewables.  They have a small island, what is it called, Marie-Galante, that has a lot of wind mills on it and so forth, yeah.  But it's all diesel, all diesel.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 24856
Speaker 1: Now, I think I'd be remiss if I didn't ask you about Montserrat [Caribbean island], you know, and some of the seismic research.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What happened?  They had a volcano on Montserrat, right?
Speaker 2: There is.  It's still erupting, but they are right now doing exploration for geothermal.  I mean it's a debatable thing whether they shouldn't wait longer, but they are--because they don't have a big population.  Nearly everybody left the island.
Speaker 1: Yeah, when the volcano erupted--
Speaker 2: Right, occurred, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: That was what, 2000 or so or--
Speaker 2: It's just maybe a little over, 2002 or something.  But they made a provision for them to go, I think, to England or Canada, anybody who wanted to go, with some money even to help them.  A lot of them took it up, so the population is a couple of thousand people.  And I don't know why they would wanna go to the expense of a geothermal.  It seems like it's overkill for that level of population.
Speaker 1: So, they're not likely to come back, even to--
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  What I'm doing now in the Caribbean mostly now is looking for water.  We have zeroed in on the island of St. Lucia for the last several years.  Mostly their current drinking water comes from rivers, but it's getting polluted and not sufficient.  So, with our technology, we're trying to find underground water, ground water, which would be not very polluted and hopefully can supply a country.  So, we're very deep into that project.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 24857
Speaker 1: Well, tell me now, we always ask this question.  When you look back on everything you've done to this point today, what would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: My legacy?  I don't know.  How do you define this word legacy?
Speaker 1: Well, the things that you left behind for future generations, works and--
Speaker 2: But as viewed by me or by, viewed by you, as such?  I think that's a big difference to me.
Speaker 1: Yeah, how you see your legacy, what you think your legacy will be.
Speaker 2: I mean, from the way I see it, one way I could answer that is some years ago here [at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, Massachusetts], I was doing something for some education group, and teaching something.  And they asked me how do I view myself as a teacher?  And my answer to that was if I succeed, my students should forget me.  See, if I succeed in imparting to them all the knowledge and techniques, the way to think, I am invisible.  They don't need me anymore, see.  So, that's why it's kind of a hard thing to--I think if you ask the people who have been around me, my students and so forth--and I think in a classroom, I'm very challenging because I am not one to dot my "I"s and put the periods.  I do leave a lot of work up to them, and it's probably because of my past history.  My graduate students, when they come in too, it's a very similar thing.  I don't even, often they wouldn't even sit down.  I'd say, what it is you want? No, you haven't worked long enough on that because I know they can find the answer, okay.  So, I think from them, you will find that a lot of them will, they will say it both with fondness, and I might use a word as strong as, say with some hatred (laughter), the fact that sometimes working with me is difficult because I do expect them to do things and be creative, whether sometimes they have to stay up late, or stay up late for days or so forth.  Another thing from this department especially that many, many students will remember me for is the number of field trips I've done with them.  And the way I do the field trip is, any country I'm going to, like another island in the Caribbean we work a lot in is Barbados.  And there we work on underground caves.  But what I do is, I take the crew before we go, for a week.  And I say, "This is the job that we are going to do for the government of that country.  And we're gonna give them a professional report at the end.  And we have five days on the ground."  And then I assign to each person, I say "You're gonna be our expert in biology."  You're gonna be--"Oh, I can't do biology."  "No, you're gonna be the expert on biology, and you're going to be the expert on this."  And I think every student that has ever gone on one of them will tell you it has been life-changing to them because they are so accustomed, you know, to going to their class and the book work and whatever.  And I take them into an environment of solving a real a problem for a real country in a short period of time.  And you know, the first thing they tell you is, "Oh Dale, but we need more data."  I say "No, the prime minister and the ministers, they need an answer."  Interesting thing happens every time.  On about the third day, I get a mutiny, a very bad mutiny in the evening.  And I said, "Okay, and we go and lock ourselves in a room.  And we're not leaving this room"--I order in pizza or something.  "We're not leaving this room until we come with our plan of what we're gonna do in the next days."  And there's a lot of resentment, resistance to it.  And before you know it, when they realize I'm serious, you start to see some of the most wonderful, creative ideas on how to put together the things we have, all right.  But the mutiny is always about the same thing.  It's that I'm not telling them exactly what to do, and I know how to do it.  I let them make mistakes, and have to repeat it.  And we could have saved this hour.  And I said, well, we are not gonna do it again.  You're not going to make a mistake twice, see.  So, I think all of them fondly remember these things.  And they remember, many of them have gone back to the countries afterwards on a personal basis, you know, to meet with friends and sometimes workers that they meet with, they talk to or e-mail and so forth.  I think it has changed their life a lot because they have to learn how to think on their feet to solve a problem that nobody knows how to solve.  You can't pick up any book or go to Google [search engine] and get the answer.  And I think if you were to ask me if I could do that only for the rest of my life, I think I do have a good ability to do that.  And that would be the best contribution I could make; writing another fifty papers, you know, it's here or there.  But to get young people to think, I often tell them they have to think like the military.  They don't like to hear that word, but to get them to think and focus, you know.  Something I set out at one of the ScienceMakers' thing [HistoryMakers' public program] in Oakland [California] is I told them, you know, people say think outside the box.  I have a different way I say it.  I talk about it in a mathematical way about interpolation between two points and extrapolation, which is the unknown.  And I try to get them to extrapolate because if you just interpolate, you're not going anywhere.  If you learn to extrapolate, you're going into unchartered territories and create new things.  But it's scary.  It's scary.  You have to have your thinking processes on very well.
Story_ID: 24858
Speaker 1: Is there a project that you would like to solve, you know, now that you're kind of at the end of your career at MIT here, so what's--
Speaker 2: Well, I'm thinking actually of changing gears a little bit.  And a little bit of it, you're, the big boss back of this project, Julieanna [Richardson, founder and executive director of The HistoryMakers] has put in my head.  After the, this big meeting we had in Oakland and whatever, she told me she thought that--and I take it very seriously because she's a woman with a lot of experience in this area.  She thought I could even consider giving up my job at MIT to be a motivational speaker.  And I've been--before that, now and then I'd do a workshop for like eleven or twelfth graders that I call 'Learning to Learn'.  The basis of it is that we have all gone and had so much education at school, and it's usually about stuffing knowledge down our throat.  Have they ever told you how people learn?  Have they ever told you how to learn?  Have they ever told you how to deal with this and that and whatever?  No, everybody assumes we know to do that, from the time we are born.  So I have this workshop about how to learn.  With the hope at the end is that if any individual learns how to learn for themselves, a transformation takes place.  They don't need anyone else.  They don't need any other courses.  They can do it.  They can be self-reliant.  So, I've been cleaning that up and putting that together in a nice little book and probably in the next year or two you will see me a little bit on the road with that.  I don't plan, as she thinks that I should leave my job (laughter).  But what I am gonna do because I know of her experience and her staff, you know, although they're always bugging me, you know, I consider them very, very good, her staff.  She's trained them.  I'm gonna ask her for a little bit of help when I finish with my draft, and maybe even practice it on that group, and say, "What do you guys think?" because I feel like in a funny way it turned out, we went from having a kind of a controversial--to where I feel like I'm part of their family.  And I would like to get their input before I really go out on this.  But that's one of my passions that I'm looking forward to next year.  I've been playing around for a few years, of starting, you know, something like a plan or something like that, but only for mathematics.  I want to call it 'The Math Matrix', because I think you can argue about it, but maybe the worst taught subject in America is mathematics, even worse than science, even worse than English.  And I thought if I, something I might like to devote some time to.  But certainly I'm gonna go with 'Learning to Learn', and you know.
Story_ID: 24859
Speaker 1: What--now, I guess I'm tempted to ask this.  What is wrong with America in math education--?
Speaker 2: Mathematics?
Speaker 1: --yeah, the way it's taught now.
Speaker 2: Well, there's a bigger question.  What is wrong with a lot of American education today?  And the simple answer is that you have schools of education, and they messed the whole thing up.  I think a lot of people who go to the schools of education, you know, they're more like psychologists and sociologists, and so forth.  And I think many of them may not actually be good teachers.  And the outcome of all of it in time is that we've become a nation here where in the schools--I'll make the analogy to a prison.  We have the prisoners running the prison.   How is that going to work out?  We have the students running the institutions.  How is that going to work out?  And you always have, every now and then, to stop.  Even here, sometimes I stop (unclear) in as colleagues, I say "Look guys, stop."   We can't ask the students what it is they want us to teach them.  Sometimes we have to say that is why we are here, as older people with some experience.  This is what we're gonna teach you.  "Yeah, but they'll be upset if we teach them that."  And you will see so many people backing away at that point, you know.  I think the system has just sort of gone that way, you know.  And any--every now and then you'll see a school, in Washington, here, wherever, that gets a lot of kudos for doing well.  And it's always because they bring in one person who's a little strict and says, you know, this is how we're gonna do it, and the kids love it, the kids love it.  But somehow Washing--we can't get this done nationwide somehow, you know.  The kids love it, you know.  So.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 24860
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back at everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: No, in terms of my career, the only thing I would say, a lot of it, as I have told you, sort of happened not by plan.  And, you know, the old verbiage that you tell people, choose, you know, grab opportunities when they come.  I think that did happen in my life, and at the time I didn't really know if it was a good or a bad opportunity.  But I maybe had the sense to know it was a good opportunity.  So, no, I don't think there's not much I'd do, you know, different, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's been a great life.  I've had a lot of great travel, met friends all over the world.  And I think, I don't know if it's good or bad, but, you know, around MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] we make a joke and say all faculty are very arrogant and very egotistical.  I think that's true.  But I'm certainly not sitting on the top of that pole, you know.
Story_ID: 24861
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?  And I think you've expressed some of it in terms of education.  But--
Speaker 2: It's such a tough problem, it's such a tough problem.  And last night I was listening to parts of this case that's going on with the girl at UT-Austin [University of Texas-Austin] who is suing the university.  And people have been looking at the University of California system since this regulation 209 or whatever it's called.  And you know, what's coming out of it is that a lot of people are being pushed forward that can't handle the particular system.  And how do you deal with things like that, that are so difficult?  We have been, it's very current in my mind, we have a case of, you know, a number of African students coming here that's even taken outside of the U.S. color thing.  And they're just not clicking when they come here.  And these are people that have talents, really good talents.  So, the problem is a very, very, difficult one.  I think because it's so multi-faceted, we are hitting from (unclear), you know, people say, well, if you have more minority faculty, that will help.  Sure, it will help, you know.  I mean, I have gone into classes, and people--well, not now anymore.  When I was younger, and they think I'm the TA [teaching assistant], and they want to know when is the professor coming, you know?  And you have to get over those barriers.  But, to me, if there's a single thing I can say on the whole diversity issue is, do not divide, integrate.  As minority people, there's always too much of a tendency, even here at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], everywhere, to say, you know, like we have a monthly dinner for color faculty.  We have this separation, separation, and I understand where it's coming from.  You understand where it's coming from, but I think that holds us back.  Even when I was a student here, they made a special dorm only for black guys.  And I remember myself objecting to it.  You know, so when they finished the day with whatever problems they have, they get back to this comfort zone, where they can talk their way and behave their way and so forth.  But it holds you back, because that is not how life is in the world here.  And so I really believe very strongly in telling people to integrate and diversify.  That's the only way it's gonna happen.  If you stay over there--they were talking about UT-Austin on public radio last night, and they say all the male whites stay by themselves.  All the white females stay by--all the Asians stay by themselves, all the Latinos.  This is what you don't want to happen in a society.  It's not easy.  It's a very difficult thing, it's a very difficult thing.  And in the education, it's partly why I want to do this 'Learning to Learn'.  I hope I can, you know, change a lot of people.  See, one of the things nobody has ever really put their finger on in education.  Let's say I can bring ten students here, and two of them, everyone knows, all the faculty, absolutely outstanding.  And it doesn't matter of their color, which country they've come from.  Something happened to them in their education that changed them.  See, like in my case, this history of taken here.  It might be Father Lynch, Jiggle, and my advisor here [doctoral advisor at MIT, Theodore Madden].  But it can happen even when a kid is small.  But it seems like you have to have this singular experience.  It doesn't matter if you go private school or public school, but you need to have that experience that makes that change in you.  If we can bottle that, if we can find out how to do that for every kid, you know, even the K through 12 [kindergarten through twelfth grade], that will change the country, change the world, because a kind of a fly by night thing.  And I say, you know, from the time you're young, they just say you can learn, go to school, you know.  And in the old days, they beat it into you.  Now, you gotta use psychology.  But is there a way, for example, more teaching with hands on.  That could be a way.  Make people think about things, put into--you know.  So that recipe is still out there.  I think every now and then there are individuals that have gotten that.  And they try to pass it on.  But no one has written a bestseller on how to make that recipe so parents can practice it, individuals can practice it and so forth.  That's the great question out there, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 24862
Speaker 1: Now tell us something about your family.  Now, you have children, right?  And you've been married?
Speaker 2: I have one son.  I have been married.  I'm actually, this year, next month will be forty years.  We got married very young.  But we have been separated for about ten years.  My wife is an M.D. [doctor of medicine]. She's a neurologist.  She works between the Mass, U-Mass [University of Massachusetts] system and private practice.  And my son who is twenty-three now, the best way of describing him is that he's become a fairly, for his age, an extremely good poet.  And the word we hear from, let me say, rather well-known people in poetry and so forth is that--I don't know if he can live up to it, I don't like telling young people that--but many people have told him that he will become one of the significant writers of his generation.  If they had asked me, I'd say, don't tell him (laughter).  Let him, you know what I'm saying, just--but he writes sometimes, eight, ten hours a day.  At first, it was a surprise, because I think he knew that I wrote a little bit of poetry earlier in my life, not significantly.  He knew of his grandmother's wizardry with English.  But there was never anything in that direction.  But at age twelve in high school here, he saw some competition to enter, global competition, and he entered it.  And I think it was close to 10,000 people from eighty-seven countries that entered.  And they gave ten prizes and he got one of the prizes at age twelve.  And his poem, it's a good thing to get to the end of this, when I saw it, I was shocked by it because I thought it was written by a seventy-four year old man.   It was called 'Shape Shifting', which is a word from science fiction.  And the poem basically is about every day you wake up, you have to change your persona--this is a word he uses in the poem--to deal with the things of that day.  And so, you shape shift into whatever problems you have to deal with and so forth.  I was really amazed that a twelve year old kid could write this.  So, he's gone on a lot from that, and, you know, written some serious and long poems, and I think last year he was trying to challenge himself and write a whole book on one poem only, which he has finished.  He hasn't tried to publish it yet.  I think it's called the 'End of Color Film', you know.  But he's doing well.  The literature guys here that I know quite well, they have met with him.  They have talked, they have told me, just leave him alone.  And, so, we are very close.  We talk to each other every day, see each a couple of times.  He living on his own now in Central Square.  But there's no question what he is going to do.  He'll just basically write poetry until he sees that there, you know.
Story_ID: 24863
Speaker 1: Now, I have one last question.  Is there anything else I should ask before I ask the last question?
Speaker 2: No, go ahead.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The last question is similar to legacy, very close.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  Well, I'll tell you what I think sometimes that they're going to put on my tombstone--that would be a good answer?  I think sometime what they're going to put on my tombstone is that "He was usually so honest, he was stupid."  I suffer a lot from being honest and candid.  It's been very hard for me in the journey in the U.S. not to be able to speak my mind at meetings with colleagues.  They always shroud it around some darned thing or the other.  Sometimes it's opaque, sometimes a little transparent.  You know, you've got a good taste for it if you ever look at the British parliament.  You see how they fight each other, and the Canadians, and they throw things and whatever.  And so, and when they come out they're all buddies, and they're going have, right?  You would never see that in American Congress.  The way you grow up in the British system, you know, me and my colleagues, there in physics or whatever, and so I mean, Oh, we could have at five o'clock afternoon, oh, we would call each other names.  It's all about the argument at the time, the beauty of it, and then the next day, we don't even know what we talked about.  You can't do that here.  People keep remembering these things.  They keep taking it with them.  So that's what I mean when I say he was too honest--too, stupidity, really.  Because if you're smart about it, if you're not stupid, you wouldn't be very honest to succeed here.  But unfortunately, I still continue the same way (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Alright, thank you.
