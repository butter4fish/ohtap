I know her, her mother's maiden name was Charity, and my grandmother was the oldest of five children and her mother died when she was in the third grade and she quit school to help take care of her siblings.  And her, my mother's father was one of three brothers.  My grandmother and my grandfather both were from North Carolina, but lived in Norfolk, Virginia (simultaneous)--

Speaker 1: Okay now there, are there any stories in the family that are passed down (unclear)--?
Speaker 2: The, the only one I remember my grandfather lost his job during the I guess the Depression [Great Depression] and my mother used to always say that he was probably the only black man that did not vote for Roosevelt [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] because apparently Roosevelt did something that forced the plant to close, so they lost their home during that and moved in with some relatives.  And then my aunt used to tell me that while they were living with these relatives they saved every dime and every penny they could to buy another home.
Speaker 1: Were they able to do it?
Speaker 2: They were, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now what was your mother's growing up like?  Now did she pass away when you were young?
Speaker 2: She, no she passed away ironically on my youngest daughter's second birthday, on Mother's Day.

Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was--he was born October the 11th, 1931, in Richmond, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what can you tell us about your ancestors on your father's side?
Speaker 2: His father was, my father was a dentist, and his father [Henry Martin, Sr.] was a physician and his grandfather was a pastor.  They used to call him Sweet Papa and, and his wife Sweet Mama, and my father's grandparents were from Selma, Alabama, and his grandfather founded one of the churches that Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] used as headquarters for the Selma march [Selma to Montgomery March].
Speaker 1: I know there's Brown's Chapel [Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church, Selma, Alabama].
Speaker 2: There's Brown's Chapel and this street, this was Green Street Baptist [Green Street Missionary Baptist Church, Selma, Alabama], so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is it on that same street?
Speaker 2: It's right around the corner.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay so--
Speaker 2: And we can trace dad's family back to his, my, my, my grandfather's grandfather was from Haiti.  His name was Moses Martin [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay from Haiti, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: And is there a story about how he came to the U.S.?
Speaker 2: I don't know the story, but it, it's kind of funny I always knew that dad's side of the family had not been enslaved in the United States.  It was just something about their approach to life that you could tell that they had not been enslaved in the United States.
Speaker 1: Okay, well it, it was close (laughter)--
Speaker 2: It was close, it was close (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) I mean, if you were from Haiti--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --they had the Haitian Revolution in 1791.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Freedom in 1804.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But, a rough time of it--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --so I don't know if there's--I know one time in the 1820s black folks were going to Haiti to college to help---
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --build the nation--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and it didn't work out--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --and a lot of them came back and so your great-great-grandfather would of--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --have arrived sometime in the mid-19th century or late 19th century.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yep.
Speaker 1: Yeah, mid-1870s, '80s [1880s] (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah and originally he was in Mississippi and then the family migrated to, to Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So he made have come up through the Gulf [Gulf of Mexico]--
Speaker 2: That's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) through Biloxi [Mississippi] or something.
Speaker 2: That's, that's what I think.
Story_ID: 659212
Speaker 1: Now you father [Henry Martin, Jr.] from what I understand if I have the right person here is quite a figure.  He was a dentist.  He was a basketball player in college and--is that the same one?
Speaker 2: He was the trainer for the basketball team at Virginia State [Virginia State College; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia].
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2: And at Armstrong [Armstrong High School, Richmond, Virginia] when he was in high school, yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right so--
Speaker 2: But, he was inducted into the hall of fame at Virginia State, sports hall of fame.
Speaker 1: Okay as a trainer.
Speaker 2: Yeah, as a trainer.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know I think, I never heard of a trainer being honored like that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so he, okay.  So, he was pursing his dental, you know degree I guess at the time--well he got his dental degree at Howard [Howard University College of Dentistry, Washington, D.C.], so--
Speaker 2: Correct, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so.  So, well is there a story about what he did as a trainer that--
Speaker 2: You know I, I don't know the back story there, but he loved sports I can tell you that.  He was an avid golfer, scratch golfer, and had season tickets to the Redskins [Washington Redskins].  The day they opened up RFK Stadium [Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium, Washington, D.C.] and, but a tremendous--he, he was a coach, I mean and we lived in Selma, Alabama, for one year and he was the basketball coach, head basketball coach, head football coach, and head wrestling coach and won state championship in all three sports that year--
Speaker 1: Now did--now was your father born in Selma?
Speaker 2: No, he was born in Richmond [Virginia].
Speaker 1: Richmond okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The family came to Richmond because of Virginia Union [Virginia Union University].  My grandfather [Henry Martin, Sr.] came here to go to Union, but he had a brother and a brother-in-law that were both on the faculty at Union.  In fact, my namesake George Martin [ph.] was on the faculty of Virginia Union.
Story_ID: 659213
Speaker 1: He [Martin's father, Henry Martin, Jr.] became a dentist at Howard University school of dentistry [Howard University College of Dentistry, Washington, D.C.], right?  And he--were there any stories about his, his dental school days?
Speaker 2: Well, he actually graduated from Virginia State [Virginia State College; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia] and then went into the [U.S.] Army.  He was in the ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps.], second lieutenant, became a first lieutenant and went to Korea and then after Korea went to Selma [Alabama], stayed there for a short period and then came back to Virginia and coached for a while and then ultimately decided to go to dental school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  He was the first lieutenant in the Quartermaster Corps [U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps] (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Correct, correct.
Speaker 1: --in the Korean War.
Speaker 2: Which of course that's why I was born at Fort Lee [Virginia].
Speaker 1: Now did he have any stories about the integration of the Army, 'cause he would have been there right on the cusp of integration right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, not that, that he relayed to me.  Yeah, I've seen pictures from his days in the Army and he, he definitely was in an integrated group and you know from, from what I know he had some really good friends from his days in the Army.
Speaker 1: He was in the first wave of black officers who were allowed to command white people--
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: --in the United States.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Right.  So he never really talked about that?
Speaker 2: He didn't, he didn't talk about it a lot you know.  I mean the only other thing I remember was he said that his first day in Korea he, you know, actually had to, you know basically pull a gun on somebody who was trying to steal something, but other than that he really didn't talk about it a whole lot.
Speaker 1: Okay (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Which I'm told is not uncommon, I mean I, I've talked to other people who said their fathers who, who were overseas generally don't talk about it a lot.
Speaker 1: Yeah, this, yeah there, there is something (unclear).  Now did you know who he had to pull a gun on?  Was it a Korean or--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a Korean.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, so he comes back he goes to, he goes back to Selma for a while, then he goes to Howard.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay and so his father was Dr. Henry S. Martin, Sr. [Henry Martin, Sr.]--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --was an M.D., yeah.
Speaker 2: Correct.  Yeah and unfortunately my grandfather died when my dad was only about six years old.  But, he had a practice here in an area called Fulton [Fulton Hill, Richmond, Virginia] and unfortunately contracted tabuclo--tuberculosis rather from, from one of his patients.  It's kind of sad my great-grandparents had eight children, four boys and four girls and of the four boys three of them went to med school and all three that went to med school contracted tuberculosis and died, so.
Speaker 1: So they, you think they may have had a genetic susceptibility to it?
Speaker 2: Don't know but they suspected they caught it from patients, so.
Speaker 1: Yeah well tuberculosis, or what they used to call consumption--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --was like scourge of urban--yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yep.  I remember when my grandmother [Martin's paternal grandmother, Charlotte Williams Martin] was alive literally she had to be tested every year.
Story_ID: 659214
Speaker 1: Did your grandfather [Henry Martin, Sr.] attend Howard medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: He actually went to Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee], but he did his internship at Howard.  And ironically his brother, George Martin [ph.], went to Howard.  In fact, George Martin graduated with the highest GPA [grade point average] of the med school history to date.  He had a 98 [percent] overall, which today still stands as the highest GPA.  I think he had one B.  But, he was on the faculty at Virginia Union [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia] before he went back to med school, so they ended up graduating the same time ev- even though George was older and I have a cousin who lives in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] I call her Aunt Bertha [ph.].  She was the only child.  My dad [Henry Martin, Jr.] was the only child.  They, you know, we very close, but she's technically my cousin, but she used to joke that when she went to Howard and the folks on the faculty found out that she was George Martin's niece they gave her a hard time, that they expected her to do as well as he did.
Speaker 1: But (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She, she also went to dental school at Howard [Howard University College of Dentistry, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Howard medical school have so many geniuses--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --on the faculty, W. Montague Cobb [William Montague Cobb] and there's, you know and Jack White [Jack E. White] and all these people so.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I don't know.  So this is your, your great uncle then George Martin?
Speaker 2: Correct, correct.  So my great uncle and my grandfather were both at Howard at the same time, but as interns and residents.
Speaker 1: Now where did your (unclear) practice medicine?
Speaker 2: He went back to Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So in Selma [Alabama] then?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay all right.  Now--
Speaker 2: In fact actually I'm wrong he, he went back to Birmingham [Alabama].
Story_ID: 659215
Speaker 1: How did your parents [Barbara Faulkner Martin and Henry Martin, Jr.] meet--is there a story (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At Virginia State [Virginia State College; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia].
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: At Virginia State.
Speaker 1: At Virginia State okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right is there a story about what happened?
Speaker 2: All I know is they were both students at, at Virginia State and they met.  I, there was a woman, he was superintendent of the schools here in Richmond [Virginia] at one point and she was joking that you know she just remembered seeing them on campus, you know, walking hand in hand and what have you, but, but I don't really know the back story.
Story_ID: 659216
Speaker 1: We always ask this question--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --when you consider your parents' personalities their sense of humor, their talents, their interests--
Speaker 2: Sure
Speaker 1: --how they walked, talked, looked, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Probably my dad [Henry Martin, Jr.].  I mean ironically I look more like my mother [Barbara Faulkner Martin] in terms of complexion, but in terms of personality probably more like my dad and he and I were very close.  He died about four years ago, but we were very close and we talked every day, so.  But, I think personality wise I, I, a lot like him.  Now the irony is my, my parents divorced and my dad remarried and my second mom [Ruby Grant Martin], I don't like the term stepmom I always say second mom, was, we were very close as well.  In fact, she actually had a lot to do with, she went to Howard law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.] as well.  She had a lot to do with my decision to go to law school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, it's ironic even though she wasn't my biological mother, there are lots of things that I see now that I know I picked up from her.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So.
Story_ID: 659217
Speaker 1: Your second mother was Ruby Grant Martin is that tr- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay and she was an attorney and--
Speaker 2: Finished number one in her class [at Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.] and had the highest score on the Ohio bar when she took it.  But, because she was a black woman she couldn't find a job.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so she grew up in Cleveland [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Cleveland.  She grew up in Cleveland.  She was born in Arkansas, grew up in Cleveland, and there's a little story there.  Her father, my grandfather, Grandpa Bennie [ph.], was the postmaster in this little place outside of Eudora, Arkansas, and when he left to go to Cleveland he had, he owned the general store and he was a postmaster.  And so when he left the town disappeared, that's how small it was.  I've been there.  It's right there on the levy.
Speaker 1: So Eudora, Arkansas.
Speaker 2: It's a suburb of Eudora.  Eudora is literally a one stoplight town, so you can--
Speaker 1: Well, okay. So now we have a note here that your father [Henry Martin, Jr.] read a lot.
Speaker 2: He did.
Speaker 1: He had huge library books--
Speaker 2: He did.
Speaker 1: --and you said even though your, your second mom [Ruby Grant Martin] was a lawyer your father was a major influence on you becoming a lawyer (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes he did.  He, he basically planted the seed.  Ironically my dad was a dentist, and he had my life all planned.  He wanted me to go to the Naval Academy [United States Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland] and then do one year in law school after I did my active duty just because it would be a good experience and then go to dental school and, and practice with him.  I started thinking about it.  I looked at what my mom was doing, I looked at what he was doing and I said you know, "I think I might like law school better than dental school," and so then I, that, that was how the seed was planted though.  But, but a lot of it obviously came from, from watching her.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Now when did they get together?  How old were you when--
Speaker 2: They actually met at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] and they got married in 1960 I think. It was either '59 [1959] or '60 [1960], yeah.
Speaker 1: I might say, if I may it seems unusual usually for children to end up with their father instead of their mother--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and be raised by--is there a story about that?
Speaker 2: Well I mean in fairness I mean I spent a lot of time with my mother [Barbara Faulkner Martin].  I spent a lot of time with my father, and I also spent a lot of time with my grandparents [Charlotte Williams Martin and Henry Martin, Sr.], his parents.  And I joke that at Christmas and summers literally I, visited, my father and my second mother [Ruby Grant Martin] lived in Washington, on Columbia [Road], so I visited there and I came to Richmond [Virginia] to visit my grandparents.  I went to Norfolk [Virginia] to visit my mother.  So, I spent a lot of time with all of them.
Speaker 1: So you were basically raised in Richmond or?
Speaker 2: Pretty much yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.  And you know Washington, D.C. is not that far away so I guess you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I spent a lot of time in Washington, yes.
Story_ID: 659218
Speaker 1: Now do you have siblings?
Speaker 2: I do.
Speaker 1: All right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I have one sister [Cheryl Martin Napper], one brother [Anthony Martin], and I had another brother [Marc Martin] who passed away ten years ago.
Speaker 1: And where do you stand in the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm the oldest.
Speaker 1: You're the oldest.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: All right so were they all raised with you?
Speaker 2: They were, no, (laughter) they, they were different as well so.
Speaker 1: Okay, some are your mother's [Barbara Faulkner Martin] children and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But, I'm, I'm closest--
Speaker 1: --some are your father's [Henry Martin, Jr.] and I mean?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yeah.  I'm closest to my sister who is here in Richmond.
Story_ID: 659219
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I remember being at the beach in Norfolk [Virginia] a lot.  I do remember that.  And my mother [Barbara Faulkner Martin] loved the beach and I love the beach today.  I mean that's you know one of my favorite things to do.  But, yeah I do remember being at the beach at a, a really young age, so.  And we would go and just stay, I mean practically all day, so.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I have fond memories of being at the beach.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I, the other thing that I remember that's kind of funny when I was a kid before I started school this ice cream truck used to come through the neighborhood, Mister Softee, and I established an account with the ice cream truck and didn't have any money.  I said, "Well if you give me ice cream today my mother will gladly pay you on Tuesday."
Speaker 1: So you were the Wimpy of Mister Softee (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right. Absolutely yes.
Speaker 1: Mister Softee franchise.
Speaker 2: I, I, had an account.
Speaker 1: In the--did you see that (unclear)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) It's funny, I, later in life I saw that on 'Popeye' ['Popeye the Sailor'], but I don't know, it's possible that's where I picked it up, but I don't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You don't know what came first?
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: Or the--okay, all right.
Story_ID: 659220
Speaker 1: So (pause) growing up now, so were you mostly in Richmond [Virginia] I guess--
Speaker 2: Mo- Richmond for school.
Speaker 1: Did you go to school in Richmond (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Mostly Richmond for school yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what neighborhood did you--and how is Richmond deployed?
Speaker 2: Sure.  We lived in an area called Maymont [Richmond, Virginia], which is right on the James River.  It's about five minutes from downtown and when I was born my parents [Barbara Faulkner Martin and Henry Martin, Jr.] actually lived with my grandparents [Charlotte Williams Martin and Henry Martin, Sr.], downtown on Clay Street, which is called Jackson Ward [Richmond, Virginia].  And the year after I was born they moved to an area what was then called the West End [Richmond, Virginia].  It's not nearly that far today, but they were the first black family to move into this neighborhood near Maymont park [Richmond, Virginia].  Maymont park is a, was a wonderful park owned by the city and I, we lived a block away from the park and that was my backyard.  We had our own secret entrance into the park and I joke if you go to the park today there's a groundskeeper's house and to the left of the groundskeeper's house is a hill where they planted bamboo, and I call that the George Martin memorial bamboo garden because they used to tell us not to sleigh ride on that hill and of course we ignored that.  And I never will forget, one time, I had this brand new coat and I went down the hill on the sled and hit a rock and went airborne and I landed, all the buttons on my coat were gone.  And I was supposed to be home at a certain time and I said well I'm gonna get in trouble because I messed up this coat, so I may as well get the most of it and just stay late and sleigh ride until my heart's content as well, but that was a wonderful park.  We had a lot of fun growing up near that park or in, playing in that park.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is, this is like an all-black neighborhood?
Speaker 2: It, actually no.  The irony is my, my grandparents integrated the neighborhood, but there were white families that stayed and even today it's an integrated neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Now Richmond is an interesting place.  This is the former capital of the Confederacy.
Speaker 2: Correct, correct.
Speaker 1: It's also a place where the black population is pretty large right?
Speaker 2: That's true, that is true.
Speaker 1: What proportion of the city (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This--
Speaker 1: When you was growing up it was black and has it, has it changed?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the city it's, well yeah the city has changed.  I mean unfortunately my last year in high school [Thomas Jefferson High School, Richmond, Virginia] we had busing order and in those days we had fifty thousand students in the school division.  Now it's down to twenty-two thousand.  But after the busing order a lot of the, a lot of the white families and especially those with school aged kids moved into the suburbs.  But the black population is over 50 percent.  I think it's 52 percent, something like that.  At one point it was as high as 57 percent, but I think with the last census it went down.  And ironically the population has gone up, so we are seeing more and more white families move back into the city.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So at one point the population dropped.  When I was in school, the population was about 250,000.  It dropped below two hundred [thousand] at some point.  It's now back above two hundred thousand.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But the metropolitan area is over a million.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 659221
Speaker 1: Now where did you start school?  What was the name of the school you started at (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I started actually in Norfolk [Virginia] at a school--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --called Diggs Park [Diggs Park Elementary School] and then I came to Richmond [Virginia] in the third grade and I went to George Washington Carver [George Washington Carver Elementary School], which is where my grandmother [Charlotte Williams Martin] taught for forty-seven years, also the school that my dad [Henry Martin, Jr.] attended.  Then, I went to Binford [Binford Middle School] and then to Thomas Jefferson High School [Richmond, Virginia].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I'm proud to say that when I was at Thomas Jefferson High School, we call it TJ, it was--some publication ranked it as one of the tenth best public schools, high schools in the country and had a really great experience there.  TJ had a significant--there were probably only seven blacks in my class, but we had strong Jewish representation and met a lot of good friends while I was there, that are candidly still friends.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, I had a really positive experience in high school.
Speaker 1: All right. So, was this your neighborhood high school?
Speaker 2: It was not.  I literally had to catch two buses to get there, so.
Speaker 1: This is like a magnet school situation or did you have to qualify on a test or something (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no in those days we had something called freedom of choice, so before busing.  They had busing in my last year in high school, but you, if you were a senior you got to stay at the school you were attending.  So, you could attend any school, but you had to get there on your own, so that's why I had to catch two buses.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Like I said my, you know and in fairness, my dad wanted me to go to TJ 'cause it was, like I said you know a really, really good school.  The closest school to my house was actually Maggie Walker [Maggie L. Walker High School, Richmond, Virginia], which had been historically black, which ironically my daughter graduated from Maggie Walker earlier this year.  She's a first year in college now and it's now a governor's school [Maggie L. Walker Governor's School for Government and International Studies], so you have to apply to get in.
Story_ID: 659222
Speaker 1: So Maggie Walker we, we should point out that it's named after--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Maggie Walker [Maggie Lena Walker] was a black banker.  She was ahead of her time. Literally over 100 years ago she founded a black bank.  I think it started out as St. Luke Penny Bank [St. Luke Penny Savings Bank, Richmond, Virginia], and unfortunately it later became Consolidated Bank and Trust [Consolidated Bank and Trust Company; Premier Bank, Inc.].  Unfortunately about fifteen years ago or so they had to sell and so it's no longer a black bank.  But, for the longest time it was the oldest black bank in the nation, and Maggie Walker was just a phenomenal entrepreneur.  And in fact the city is getting ready to erect a monument in her honor on, on Broad Street.  But, the high school, Richmond [Virginia], had two predominantly black high schools, Maggie Walker [Maggie L. Walker High School; Maggie L. Walker Governor's School for Government and International Studies] and Armstrong [Armstrong High School] and originally two predominantly white high schools, John Marshall [John Marshall High School] and Thomas Jefferson [Thomas Jefferson High School].  They later built another one called George Wythe [George Wythe High School].  But, the Maggie Walker rivalry was fierce.  I mean they had this football game that they played the Saturday after Thanksgiving every year and they used to draw crowds of twenty-seven thousand at this fairly small stadium, but it was an event.
Speaker 1: Maggie Walker versus Armstrong.
Speaker 2: Armstrong, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Armstrong that's the name of, the former name of the Dunbar High School [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School] in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's correct, yeah.
Speaker 1: --used to be Armstrong [sic.].  He [Samuel Chapman Armstrong] was some kind of a military person.
Speaker 2: Yes, a general.
Speaker 1: Yeah, a general.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but, but my grandmother [Charlotte Williams Martin] and my father [Henry Martin, Jr.] both went to Armstrong.  Armstrong was never quite as good in football as Walker, so it seems like every year they, they got there, well they, they lost the game, but it was always exciting 'cause every year you know they came close and you thought okay this year finally Armstrong is gonna win.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: I don't know if you're familiar with athletes like Willie Lanier, but he played at Maggie Walker, and they have a huge plaque in his honor at the current school.
Speaker 1: Willie Lanier the great linebacker (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Correct.
Speaker 1: --with the Kansas City--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --Super Chiefs [sic. Kansas City Chiefs]. Right. Back in the--
Speaker 2: Absolutely who is now, well he was a stockbroker here in town.  He, he's still in Richmond.
Story_ID: 659223
Speaker 1: In grade school [George Washington Carver Elementary School, Richmond, Virginia] what, what were you interested in, in grade school now had you, had, were you following the plan, your father's plan basically--
Speaker 2: In--he really hadn't developed it by that point, but I, my, my grandmother [Martin's paternal grandmother, Charlotte Williams Martin] taught math and so I loved math, always loved math and, and ironically my daughter that just graduated from Maggie Walker [Maggie L. Walker Governor's School for Government and International Studies, Richmond, Virginia] loves math as well.  She's thinking about majoring in math, but, but yeah I was a huge science and math person.  I had a nice chemistry set, and a lot of Friday nights we would just play with my chemistry set, so, but and I joke that physics was actually my favorite all-time class.  So, sometimes I think gosh I probably should have become an engineer, but I loved math and science.
Speaker 1: Now we interviewed 150 black scientists from 2011 to 2013 I think it was--
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: --and there are just so many stories about people that have that chemistry set.  I forget the name.  I, I was trying to think of the name of it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Everybody had the same pretty much (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yep, yep.
Speaker 1: --and it made a big impact on everyone, but most of the scientists blew something up with it they said (laughter) before (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, there was a guy who lived a couple of blocks from me who actually became a chemist, and he had a wonderful chemistry set.  I'll never forget he got in just  a lot of trouble with his parents, same thing he got a brand new jacket and he spilled something on it and you know messed it up.
Speaker 1: It's Gilbert [A.C. Gilbert Company] I think, Gilbert (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, right it was Gilbert that's exactly right.
Speaker 1: That's right. Chemistry set.
Story_ID: 659224
Speaker 1: So you had scientific proclivities, that's, that's good, but, but what made you turn from something that you really loved, you know, I mean, I mean you didn't, well not necessary turn from it, but, but what made you pursue another--
Speaker 2: Well, like I said, dad [Henry Martin, Jr.] planted the seed about going to law school and, and the more I thought about it, in fact the irony is when I thought about going to law school I really wanted to open up my own shop and, and basically handle pro bono cases and law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.] changed that a little bit.  I worked for a couple of public interest law firms when I was in school and realized I could do more working in a large law firm in terms of having resources and what not, and, and I have been able to do a lot here in terms of pro bono and--
Speaker 1: But in those days I guess the role model for an attorney would have been your second mom [Ruby Grant Martin] right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And she was a civil rights attorney--
Speaker 2: She was a civil rights lawyer, yeah.
Speaker 1: --who actually worked for health, education and welfare office [U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services].
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was the head of OCR [Office for Civil Rights] when Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] was president, and when Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] was elected she stayed for a short period, but then she and Marian Edelman Wright [sic. HistoryMaker Marian Wright Edelman] formed a public interest law firm called the Washington Research Project and their goal was to monitor civil rights under the Nixon administration and that morphed into the Children's Defense Fund.
Speaker 1: Okay and (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And ironically she hired Hillary Clinton [Hillary Rodham Clinton] when she was at the Children's Defense Fund.  And I'll never forget when Bill Clinton [William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] was running for governor she said, "I'm gonna send a check because if he's elected he's gonna be the youngest governor," you know, "in the country."  And as a kid I didn't pay that much attention to it like you know okay sure.  And then later I put it all together.  In fact, I still have the check that she, she wrote, the cancelled check that she wrote to, to Bill Clinton, so.
Speaker 1: Okay and did she, did she have a special interest because it was Arkansas?
Speaker 2: Well she, she used to talk about that too that you know that Hope [Arkansas] was, Hope was a big city compared to the place where she grew up in Arkansas, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now, now you were, you would have been in high school I guess when your second mother was in, in the White (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --in the Johnson administration?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Did you pay attention to what was going on (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know it, it's funny you say that.  I mean I knew, I had a, a vague idea of what she was doing and candidly today I go out of my way to tell my kids what I'm doing because I, I didn't have a full appreciation of what she was doing until much, much later.  And in the family I collect all the pictures.  I collect all the articles and what not, so I have all the articles from when she was, you know at OCR and there were, you know, she had a tough job.  I mean she was desegregating schools in the South and you know she, you know, candidly, you know, received threats and I'll never forget there's this newspaper article and there was a certain senator from a southern state who was very vocal in his opposition and wanted her fired and so forth and so on.  So, you know it was a, a tough situation, a very tough situation.
Speaker 1: Yeah, she was in a situation where, I mean she was the first woman--
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) to open a lot of doors I guess.
Speaker 2: That is true, that is true.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there weren't very many women involved in the Johnson administration, black women especially.  I think Patricia Harris [Patricia Roberts Harris]--
Speaker 2: Harris, yeah.
Speaker 1: --was one.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: But (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah and I remember when I was fourteen she got this big award and she met President Johnson.  We all had to put on a tuxedo and we all went to the dinner, and she was the youngest woman to get--they were honoring women who had achieved in government, and she was the youngest.
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is the distinguished Federal Woman's Award.
Speaker 2: Correct.  And I--
Speaker 1: She received it in 1968.
Speaker 2: That's correct.  I have that in my living room right now, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, we, yeah we were all very, very proud of her and--
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so--
Speaker 2: She was, you know she was remarkable.  She was a tremendous cook, tremendous golfer.  She loved sports, and she loved entertaining, and Christmas was her favorite time of year.  She put up at least three Christmas trees every year, and in fact gosh, all the ornaments that we have in our house now she gave us, but she was, she just loved Christmas.
Speaker 1: Okay.  She was thirty-four when she--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --received this award.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So this is really an achievement.
Story_ID: 659225
Speaker 1: So 1968 was also the year that Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yep.
Speaker 1: --and Robert Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy].
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: So this is like a momentous time in the history of the country, a lot of change.  You, you're in high, you were like--
Speaker 2: Fourteen and in high school [Thomas Jefferson High School, Richmond, Virginia], and, and I remember dad [Henry Martin, Jr.] and I were, I, I missed a lot of the TV coverage when Robert Kennedy was killed 'cause we were on a fishing trip in Nags Head [North Carolina] and we're staying in this cabin that didn't have a TV, so I didn't get to see a lot of that, but you know I obviously remember it.  That was, and of course obviously the riots in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] was a very, very tough time.
Speaker 1: Yeah did, were there riots in Richmond [Virginia]?
Speaker 2: I remember, yes there were riots, nothing like D.C. though, but I do remember you know some of the stores, you know the windows were knocked out and people had, you know were writing things on the glass to try to keep people from vandalizing the, the stores, but, but nothing like what, what happened in D.C. around Georgia Avenue.
Story_ID: 659226
Speaker 1: Thomas Jefferson High School [Richmond, Virginia] now.  There did you--now, now you're a minority you said at Thomas Jefferson.  There were only--there were only five black students?
Speaker 2: Well, there were seven (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Seven? Okay.
Speaker 2: --in my class out of 480 students, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah oh okay--
Speaker 2: So.
Speaker 1: --and there was a significant Jewish presence--
Speaker 2: Correct, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and as most good public high schools had a significant Jewish presence.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  So, I mean it, it, real, I had a great experience.  I mean I was elected homeroom president twice, and if you were in the home, if you were homeroom president you were in the house of delegates, house of representatives, rather, and then we had a senate and there were four senators in each class and I was elected my senior year as a senator.  So, in fact, I was a top vote getter for that election and obviously didn't win with those seven votes from my black friends.  So, but we had a, you know we had, we had a really, really good group of people and a lot of them when the busing order was entered rolled up their sleeves and, and helped the schools get ready for the integration.  In fact I remember went over to one of the schools in a black neighborhood it's called Church Hill [Church Hill Academy, Richmond, Virginia] to help move books so that schools could get ready.  And we were active in a, ironically in a group called the National Conference for Christians and Jews [National Conference for Community and Justice] and I remember going to some camps in Maryland, Maryland Ridge [sic. Ridge, Maryland] affiliated with the National Conference of Christians and Jews.  But, the NCJJ [sic.], NCJJ yeah really stepped up in terms of trying to help this city get ready for integration.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) NCCJ I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right I just had to write it out myself to see it (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay so what, so was your favorite subject, were your favorite subjects still math and science?
Speaker 2: Yes. Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 659227
Speaker 1: How did you decide on what college to attend?
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  I remember going to a program in the eleventh grade, and there was a fairly small dinner place out near a shopping center out here called Willow Lawn [Willow Lawn Shopping Center; The Shops at Willow Lawn, Richmond, Virginia] and there's this African American guy who spoke and very, very impressive, but it was not, it clearly was not a dinner oriented towards minorities. It was a dinner oriented towards eleventh graders at various high schools, and he made a strong impression.  And then one of my good friends, a guy by the name of Tom Klein [ph.], Jewish, said he was going to apply to UVA [University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia], and he said, "George [HistoryMaker George Keith Martin] why don't you ride up with me when we, you know, go visit," so I did.
Speaker 1: Was the speaker from UVA?
Speaker 2: He was, I'm sorry, yes the student was from UVA (unclear), UVA recruiting dinner.  And so that was my first introduction.  And then I went up with Tom and fell in love with the school.  So, it was my, my first choice.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you apply anywhere else?
Speaker 2: I did.  I mean Williams [ph.] was, was one of my choices and ironically I was recruited very heavily by Virginia Tech [Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia], which was UVA's big rival, so.  But, UVA just made a tremendous impression on me, so.
Speaker 1: Okay now UVA in those days didn't have much of a black student population (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  There were ninety-eight in my class and that was 100 percent increase over the previously year.  I mean literally the, the fourth year students, there were only three black guys in the fourth year class my first year.  One of them was a guy named L.D. Britt who is now head of surgery at Eastern Virginia medical center [Eastern Virginia Medical School, Norfolk, Virginia].  And I'll never forget every time I saw L.D. he said, "Martin get to the library," and he said, "When you sit down, every time you sit down open up a book and read."  He was just a great mentor and a good friend.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay so, so University of Virginia founded by [President] Thomas Jefferson himself back in 1819.
Speaker 2: Eighteen nineteen [1819], getting ready to celebrate the bicentennial.
Speaker 1: Yeah and so this--when you were recruited to UVA were they really actively trying to increase the number of black students?
Speaker 2: They were, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Like I said you know the fourth year three students, they went from three to ninety-eight, and there were about fifty in the second year class and maybe twenty or so in the third year class.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you start the university in 1972, is that--?
Speaker 2: Seventy-one [1971].
Speaker 1: Seventy-one [1971] okay all right.
Speaker 2: Seventeen.
Story_ID: 659228
Speaker 1: We have a note here about Clarence Cain.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now tell us about Clarence Cain.  He was a mentor of yours right?
Speaker 2: He was.  I met Clarence literally the first day on grounds [University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia].  Clarence Cain and another guy by the name of Oliver Singleton both were second year students, and they were both in the resident staff program, which meant they were dorm counselors.  And some of the guys who lived off campus in a house were having a party for the first year students and Clarence and Oliver were basically shuttling students from grounds to this, to this party.  But, I noticed that the party was in the basement of this house and Clarence and Rod, we called him, his name was Oliver, but his middle name was Rod and we called him Rod, neither one of them came down to the party.  They were just, you know, basically serving as chauffeurs for the rest of the students.  But, Clarence and I became really, really good friends, and he really, really looked out for me.  In fact, I have some law books now that he gave me, he was a year ahead of me, but, that he gave me when I was in law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.].  I don't know if you've ever seen the movie 'Philadelphia,' but that was--
Speaker 1: 'Philadelphia' story, now that stars Denzel Washington--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --and--
Speaker 2: Tom Hanks.
Speaker 1: --ironically Tom Hanks plays the role (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Correct.
Speaker 1: --that Clarence Cain--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --a black man--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --would--this is, this, it's just another example of the movies getting history--
Speaker 2: Correct. Correct.
Speaker 1: But, so what, I mean did the movie--
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: --tell--
Speaker 2: Absolutely, I mean Clarence--in, in the movie you know Hanks is a brilliant lawyer and that was Clarence, he was just brilliant.  Now, he was the first person in his family to go to college, and we established a scholarship [Clarence Cain Endowed Scholarship; Richmond Ridley Clarence Cain Endowed Scholarship] in his honor here and had his mother come up a few years ago when we, when we did that.  But, he was just a great guy.  Clarence literally would give you the shirt off his back and go buy you two or three.  I mean he was just a very generous guy, a really, really nice guy and smart.  I mean gosh he was smart.
Speaker 1: I think in, in real life he was, he worked for a law firm that Joel Hyatt and associates [Hyatt Legal Services], right (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And can you tell us the story of what happened (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, what I know is he was at the Hyatt firm and you know really, really a superstar and they moved him from D.C. [Washington, D.C.] to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and he was in charge of the office in, in Philadelphia and he unfortunately contracted AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] and he tried to keep it a secret for as long as he could, but once they found out that he had AIDS everything fell apart and they ultimately terminated him.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: And he sued the firm [Cain v. Hyatt].  Now Hyatt was the son-in-law of Howard Metzenbaum who was the senator from Ohio and--
Speaker 1: Cleveland [Ohio] area.
Speaker 2: Cleveland area correct.  And I'll tell you a story in a minute about Metzenbaum.  But, so Hyatt was trying to replace his father-in-law in the [U.S.] Senate and the story broke, Washington Post [The Washington Post] broke the story about how he had mistreated Clarence.  And there were a lot of folks that believed that that was his un- he lost the election, and a lot of people believed that that was, you know, a major factor.  Quick story about Metzenbaum.  When my mother [Martin's stepmother, Ruby Grant Martin] graduated from Howard [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.], I think I mentioned she was number one in her class, had the highest score on the Ohio bar, her father arranged for her to get an interview with Metzenbaum's law firm.  And when she went in the interview, Metzenbaum said, "Well we would hire you if you could bring in seventy-five thousand dollars' worth of legal work."  Well, in those days that's like a million dollars.  And her reaction was basically if I could, I could bring in that much legal work, I wouldn't need you.  But, nevertheless he didn't give her the job, so.
Speaker 1: That's interesting, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But, yeah.
Story_ID: 659229
Speaker 1: I think The Washington-like I said, The Washington Post broke that story and I think that really was a significant cause of Hyatt [sic.] losing that election.
Speaker 2: Metzenbaum [Howard Metzenbaum] was considered a very astute and liberal senator--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --and yeah so and so if he was gonna, Joel Hyatt was gonna take Metzenbaum's place he would have had to be a little different, you know so.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: At any rate the, the--
Speaker 1: But, I will tell you this too.  I remember while the trial was going on Clarence [Clarence Cain] complained that they kept continuing the case hoping that he would die before the case could go to trial, but they didn't know Clarence.  I mean he was determined to live, and he died two months after the verdict [in Cain v. Hyatt].
Speaker 2: Yeah I, I was reading online that he weighed about 110 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --pounds at 6'4" or something, right--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --towards the end.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He was still fighting.
Speaker 1: He was.  He, and, and his mother, I mean his mother really, she was determined as well.  I mean she was, she really was determined.  But, that movie is, is very, very accurate from the standpoint of the relationship that, that Clarence had with his lawyer.  The lawyer in the movie ['Philadelphia'] is played by Denzel Washington and, and the two of them had a really strong bond.  I, I met his lawyer and I remember, you know he came to Clarence's funeral and you could tell, I mean he really, really was, you know, very, very fond of Clarence.  But, they really had a strong bond.
Speaker 2: The role was reversed (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: I don't know I guess the public, was it, you think they, they thought that the public would not accept the hero was a black man with AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome]?
Speaker 1: I don't know, I don't know.  I mean because if you think about you know you've got Denzel Washington and Tom Hanks, I mean you're right and why not make, flip the roles.  I mean, I think it would have been probably equally as successful if, if you had flipped it.  I, I really don't know why they did that, but--
Speaker 2: Okay, all right so, but you, but Clarence Cain was, was you said an exemplary.
Speaker 1: He really was, he really was.  Smart guy, just as nice as he could be.  I mean, you know, I, I, I, 'till this day I miss him, I mean I really do.  And I gave a speech at the University of Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia] about three weeks ago and invoked his name.  If I, quite candidly whenever I can I, truthfully almost every speech I give that involves the University of Virginia I invoke his name.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So.
Story_ID: 659230
Speaker 1: Now you also were friends with Leroy Roundtree Hassell [Leroy R. Hassell, Sr.].
Speaker 2: Yes, Hassell yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Hassell, okay, I'm sorry.  And he became the first African American chief justice of the Virginia supreme court [Supreme Court of Virginia].
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: He was a student--
Speaker 2: He--
Speaker 1: --was he in the same class as you?
Speaker 2: He was behind me, but I remember the day I met him.  It was in the lounge at Hancock dorm [Hancock House], and somebody told me he was from Norfolk [Virginia] and I went up and introduced myself and he said, "My name is Leroy Hassell, I went to Norview High School in Norfolk.  I was on a championship debate team.  I came to the University of Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia] because it's the best school in the State of Virginia, and I'm going to Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] because it's the best law school in the country."  And I'm thinking to myself who is this guy.  Classes haven't even started yet and already he's going to Harvard Law School.  And so I said to him "Look, I just asked your name."  But, we became really, really good friends, and he was truly my best friend.  I, he passed away almost six years ago.  It will be six years in February.  And his youngest daughter got married four years ago, and I had the honor of giving her away, but just a tremendous guy.  He also was a partner here at McGuireWoods [McGuireWoods LLP].
Speaker 1: You had a story that we collected somehow about his altruism.  You said he was always (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --looking out for other people.
Speaker 2: Yeah every Thanksgiving and Christmas he would call me and say, "George [HistoryMaker George Keith Martin], you know let's go buy some groceries and deliver them to families in need," and so we would go around and do that and you know.  But, you know he did it quietly, but yeah he was always giving and trying to help people.  And when he went on the court, you know if you're on the court you can't practice law, but invariably he would call me and say, "George I got this family, I got this guy I need you to help."  And, but he was always looking out for people, and you know in terms of trying to help them find jobs, you know or someplace to stay.  I mean he was really, really had a big heart, big heart.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And if you knew his parents [Ruth Rountree Hassell and Joseph Hassell, Sr.] you would understand 'cause they were the same way.
Speaker 1: (Pause) And he was from Norfolk, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Story_ID: 659231
Speaker 1: Now you were the head of the Black Student Alliance right?
Speaker 2: Actually not the head.  I was on the executive board.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And very active with the Black Student Alliance.  But, and at UVA [University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia] because our numbers were so small the Black Student Alliance was a very, very important organization, so.
Speaker 1: I have a note here that you would hold an annual black culture week.
Speaker 2: Yes. Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And bring in you know guest lecturers--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and performers.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Who came to town (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well [HistoryMaker] Julian Bond and of course you know later in life he, he became a member of the faculty at UVA.  But, I think in terms of speakers he was probably the most, the name that everybody would recognize in terms of speakers.  And we also had, you know, some fun.  We had some concerts and then one year we had Sly and the Family Stone and--
Speaker 1: And he showed up.
Speaker 2: Well, it, it it's funny that you say that.  We got to pick him up at the airport and we got there and this guy came out with a big Afro, looked just like Sly [Sly Stone], we thought it was him.  Got to the concert and the concert is delayed and, and the word is out that they're waiting for Sly.  We're like oh he's here, we picked him up from the airport.  So, they apparently had a clause in his contract if he didn't get there by a certain time they didn't have to pay him.  So, late, way late the concert started and this guy walks out, he has a big Afro, but it's not the same guy.  So, we realized that they were trying to pass this guy off as Sly, but it really wasn't.  So, it was kind of funny 'cause in those days he was dating Doris Day and of course the first song that they sang was 'Que Sera, Sera,' so it was kind of fun (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He was dating Doris Day--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --from Cincinnati [Ohio] now, huh.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: That's, I had no idea.
Speaker 2: But, yeah.  But, we used to have an annual black ball and they still have that at UVA and so that was a big deal.
Speaker 1: Yeah Sly had a reputation in those days of not, maybe not showing up, yeah.
Speaker 2: He did, he did, or late yeah, so.  But he, you know, to his credit I mean they, you know they said they didn't pay him.  I don't know if they did or not, but they said they weren't gonna pay him.  But, he performed.  He, he gave a good concert, he really did.  And of course we were on the front row, so that made it even better.
Speaker 1: Now were you involved in any fraternal organization?
Speaker 2: I was on the charter line for Lambda Zeta [Lambda Zeta Chapter], Omega Psi Phi [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity] and we had nine guys on line and we lined up tallest to shorts.  I was number three on line, which is kind of funny 'cause the guy who was, I'm, I'm 6'2" and the guy who was number one was about 6'4" and a half, 6'5", and so when we walked in the room you'd see the number you think my goodness if this is the first guy, what does the rest of the line look like, but we were lined up tallest to short.  So, but I was pretty active in the fraternity when I was in college.

Speaker 1: What were some of your, now, well okay before I ask you about extracu- I'm gonna ask you about ex- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure.
Speaker 1: --extracurricular things--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --you did in school [University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia], but who were some of your favorite professors or courses at UVA (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well that's a good question.  A fellow by the name of Dante Germino was probably my absolute favorite.  And I was an Echols scholar [Echols Scholars Program]--(unclear) actually two Echols scholar seminars my first semester, and he taught one of them.  And we often met in his living room at his house and he was a government professor and just incredible.  I, I literally still have books that he wrote at home.  But, he became one of my favorite.  I took every course that he taught, and, and then Joseph Washington [Joseph Washington, Jr.] who was a religion professor--
Speaker 1: Right (unclear)--
Speaker 2: --ended up at, he's deceased now, but he was at University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] before he passed away.  And a prolific writer, but he was a really, really good, just, you know, a won-
Speaker 1: I was trying to think of the name of his book.  There's one I see a lot.
Speaker 2: There was one that he wrote it was about interracial marriages and, well you know we read all of his books.  He, he wrote a lot, a really, really prolific writer.
Speaker 1: Anybody else (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Those are probably the two that I enjoyed the most.  There was another professor, Gore [ph.], who was in the speech communication department.  I took a couple of her classes as well.
Speaker 1: I mean you majored in speech (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I did, I did.  I was three hours short of a double major in, in government.  Ironically I started off as a government major and then switched to speech communication.  Was there any p- black faculty member or staff person that (unclear)--interacted with black students?
Speaker 1: Linwood Jacobs was an associate dean of students, and ironically he and my dad [Henry Martin, Jr.] went to Virginia State [Virginia State College; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia] together.  In fact, they were fraternity brothers, and we ran into him on the first day and my dad's nickname when he was in college was skinny and so when he saw me he said, "Skinny is that your boy?"  And dad said yeah and he said, "I got him," and, and he took, took really, really good care of me.  I never will forget the, for whatever reason my fourth year they had the LSAT on a Saturday morning on homecoming weekend, and he had a pla- he was renting a house outside of Charlottesville [Virginia] and he lived, kept his house here in Richmond [Virginia], so he came to Richmond on the weekends.  He said, "Well George [HistoryMaker George Keith Martin] I know you got the SA- LSAT tomorrow morning and this is homecoming weekend. It's gonna be kind of loud. Why don't you stay out at my place? I'll be in Richmond."  So he let me stay at his house to, you know, get a goodnight sleep before taking the test.  But, he was a really, really--he, he's still alive and he's a, he's a good man.  Took care of me and took care of a lot of other folks.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Quietly behind the scenes.  That was, that was his MO [modus operandi].
Speaker 2: Yeah, it sounds like he was thinking about what he was doing.
Story_ID: 659233
Speaker 1: Now you were also on the board of the Madison House right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Madison House is basically the university's office of volunteerism, and we sponsored Big Brother Big Sister program [Big Brothers Big Sisters of America], which I had a little brother and also we organized basketball tournaments with, you know, little kids and through the fraternity [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity], we coached a little team, but that was a lot of fun.  I'll never forget I had a hatchback, a Vega [Chevrolet Vega] you know with the hatchback and I remember going to see my little brother and all the, the little boys from the neighborhood would run and course in those days you know they didn't enforce seatbelts the way they do now, so I'd let all of them pile in the hatchback and you know take them with me.  But, it was, it was a lot of fun, a good experience.  And the fraternity was really, really active in working with the basketball league, so it was a lot of fun.
Story_ID: 659234
Speaker 1: Now you graduated in '75 [1975].  Did you graduate with any specific honors or anything [from the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Well, the irony is I got an award from a rival fraternity, Phi Beta Sigma [Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity], gave me the outstanding undergraduate award, which I thought was interesting.  And I was, I was pretty active with the, the Black Student Alliance.  The friend that I mentioned earlier Tom Klein and I founded something called Intercom, which was a human relations organization, and I was in the resident staff program as well and in fact my third year I was the only African American senior resident.  So senior resident you were in charge of an entire dorm.  They gave me the Echols scholars [Echols Scholars Program], which was a lot of fun.  I'm being facetious (laughter).  They paid, they made life difficult for me.
Speaker 1: Did they?  The smarter (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well I had this one guy who was taking advanced chemistry and he didn't go to class, didn't go to lab, and didn't start reading the book until maybe ten days before the exam just to see if he could do it, and he of course got an A on the exam, so, so they had a lot of time of their hands to harass me (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 659235
Speaker 1: Now you, you interned at the Children's Defense Fund. Was that before you graduated [from the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia] or after?
Speaker 2: That was the summer before I went to law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right so--
Speaker 2: I cheated a little bit 'cause my mother [Martin's stepmother, Ruby Grant Martin] was on the board (laughter).  But, I worked with Andrew Young's daughter there.  And in fact I remember being at their house the, the weekend before Andy Young [HistoryMaker Andrew Young] was appointed ambassador to the United Nations [UN].  And I, I never will forget, you know, he answered the door, he had on jeans and a t-shirt just looked like a regular guy and then you know Monday morning the announcement that he was going to be and I just thought that, yeah.  He's, he's a really, really down to earth guy, really, really, so.
Speaker 1: Okay now--
Speaker 2: My boss at the Children's Defense Fund also was the president of NOW, National Organization for Women, and so it was really kind of interesting working with her.
Speaker 1: Who, who was it?
Speaker 2: Audrey Frank Snow [ph.], now what am I, I'm sorry Audrey.  I cannot recall her last name right now, but yeah she handled a lot of special ed [special education] cases.  D.C. [Washington, D.C.] had a case called the Mills decision [Mills v. Board of Education of the District of Columbia], which basically came about before federal legislation that provided for rights for children who had disabilities.  Under the federal law now you have to develop an individual education plan for children who have special needs, and the Mills decision was a precursor to that.  So, it was a great experience for me because we basically served as advocates for these kids trying to get placements.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, yeah I have a note here that, that the Children's Defense Fund was lobbying for the passing of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --of '75 [1975], yeah.
Speaker 2: Correct, correct.
Story_ID: 659236
Speaker 1: You end up going to Howard University School of Law [Washington, D.C.] and so you, you made a final decision how far, I mean how far into your undergrad years did you make that, or did you already know you were gonna do that?
Speaker 2: In terms of Howard?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I, I didn't make that decision until my last year, and ironically Clarence Cain had a lot to do with that.  Clarence was a year ahead of me and he was at UVA law school [University of Virginia School of Law, Charlottesville, Virginia].  And while he was an undergrad at UVA [University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia], he was very, very active in pretty much all the organizations I was in and I noticed that he was having a really, really hard time divorcing himself from all those activities and I thought, you know, this is not gonna work.  I need to go to law school and focus and not be involved in extracurricular activities.  And so the minute my dad [Henry Martin, Jr.] found out that I was interested in, I wasn't interested in staying at, at UVA he again said, "Well you, you really ought to think about going to Howard," and I did.  And I, I, I had a wonderful experience.  I was in a study group with seven guys.  Ironically most of them were from California, and you can't make this up. It's kind of funny because I remember third year exams were over and one guy's name was Lamar [ph.] and he was from L.A. [Los Angeles, California] and had been the president of the student council at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] and he said, "Well when are you going home?"  I said, "Well you know I'm just gonna get in the car and drive."  He was like, "You're gonna get in the car and drive to California?"  He thought I was from Richmond, California.  He didn't realize I was from Richmond, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Yeah Richmond is right across the bay from San Francisco [California] (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly, exactly, but, but I had a wonderful experience.  Like I said we had seven guys in our study group and we, we all worked very, very hard and thoroughly enjoyed it.
Story_ID: 659237
Speaker 1: Who was the dean of the law school in those days?
Speaker 2: Well, when I started Charlie Duncan [HistoryMaker Charles T. Duncan] was the dean of the law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.], and then Wiley Branton became the dean, and Branton tried a lot of civil rights cases with Thurgood Marshall.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Duncan was part of that group that was trained by Charles Hamilton Houston (unclear)--
Speaker 2: That's correct, that's correct, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And he was on the faculty when my mother [Martin's stepmother, Ruby Grant Martin] was there and it, it's funny you mention that because literally when I was going through the pictures to prepare for this I found a picture of Charlie Duncan and Doug Wilder [HistoryMaker L. Douglas Wilder] and Henry Marsh [HistoryMaker Henry L. Marsh, III] and Henry and Henry Marsh was the first black mayor of, of Richmond [Virginia], but Doug, Henry, and my mother were all in the same class in law school, so.
Story_ID: 659238
Speaker 1: Okay so Howard law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.] in 1975, I mean who were some of the other students that were there with you and when was that?
Speaker 2: Well actually Charles Hamilton Houston's great nephew was in my study group, a guy who went to Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California] undergrad.  And one of my best friends from law school a guy named Tom Brokaw [ph.].
Speaker 1: His name is Tom Brokaw.
Speaker 2: Exactly and, and it's funny when he called during the years, unfortunately he passed away a couple of years ago, but when he called during the years the secretaries would say, "Is that the real Tom Brokaw," and I said yeah (laughter), but Tom was a, was a good friend.  Rick Hyde, who is Stevie Wonder's lawyer currently, and a fellow by the name of Marvin Jalali Woods [Marvin Hassan] was a good friend.  But, Larry Newsome who was, Larry and Rick Hyde and I were on the law review [Howard Law Journal] together.  So, the three of us worked very closely.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you were an editor on the law review.
Speaker 2: I was the number two editor and Rick was editor in chief, and I was the managing editor which was the number two editor and then Larry was the executive articles editor.  So, the three of us spent a lot of late nights in the law journal office.
Story_ID: 659239
Speaker 1: Now was, was law school [at Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.] what you thought, thought it was gonna be, were you satisfied?
Speaker 2: I enjoyed law school.  I mean it was a lot of work.  It was a lot of work, but I enjoyed it and I guess one of the things I really liked about law school, I mean I enjoyed undergrad [at the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia] don't get me wrong, but in law school everything that you've learned with the exception of property, I'll come back to that in a second, you really felt like okay I, I understand how this has a practical use.  And so it, it was really, it was a lot of work, but it was fun.  I mean I really enjoyed law school.  I, I, the irony is I'm a real estate lawyer today, but property first year is the most esoteric class you have in law school.  And so contracts is probably the toughest class, but property is, is the one that you know you have, because it's not necessarily a real estate course.  You're, you're learning about a lot of property laws and whatnot that came over with the feudal system, so a lot of it is pretty esoteric.  But, but for the most part being in law school was just really, really a lot of fun.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we had a great study group.  I mean seven guys, everybody worked hard.  First year, first semester we met every single day and for exams we assigned everybody a course and so you had to prepare the outline for that class, you know for everybody.  And so we did the outline and then we did a diagram, you know, based on the outline.  I mean we were, we were all just really, really tight and ready for the exams. We really were, so it was fun.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've heard people say it's hard to get through law school without a study group to study with.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, oh yeah, but you know the good thing about a study group you challenge each other, you know, and when you get tired you, you know you, you push.  But, but you know, but it really was fun.  I mean we, we had a lot of fun.
Story_ID: 659240
Speaker 1: You were a summer associate for Hirschler, Fleischer, Weinberg, Cox and Allen--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --in '77 [1977].
Speaker 2: Yep a Jewish law firm, predominantly Jewish law firm.  I was the, not only the only black lawyer, I was the only black person in, in the firm, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so what was that experience like 'cause you, you said earlier you had idealized yourself as doing, opening up your own private practice--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --in the community and doing--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --pro bono work.
Speaker 2: Yep.  I, I had a good summer at Hirschler, Fleischer and ironically there were only two of there for the summer, and they only had one job and they gave the job to me, so I you know pleased with that.  Became really, really good friends, the firm was Hirschler, Fleischer, Weinberg, Cox and Allen and the Allen was a guy named Buddy Allen [Everette G. "Buddy" Allen, Jr.] and we became really, really good friends.  In fact, later, you know, we invested in a lot of apartments together and he and I are still very, very close.  But, he, he took a personal interest in, in, in my development.
Speaker 1: Okay you also interned at Danzansky, Dickey, Tydings, Quint and Gordon, right.
Speaker 2: Dickey, Tydings, Quint and Gordon, yes.
Speaker 1: And Danzansky [Joseph B. Danzansky] was associated with Giant Foods [Giant Food].
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Joseph Tydings was the Tydings of--
Speaker 2: He was a former senator from Maryland.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Congressman Frank Ikard [Frank N. Ikard] of Texas who was a part of it too.
Speaker 2: And Paul Trible [Paul S. Trible, Jr.] who is current president at gosh--Christopher Newport [Christopher Newport University, Newport News, Virginia] was, was there at one point as well.  But, I worked with a guy named Bob Washington [Robert B. Washington, Jr.].  Bob was chairman of the Democratic Party for the District of Columbia.
Speaker 1: Okay, he had--so those were the days--so Bob Washington was black right?
Speaker 2: Correct
Speaker 1: Okay.  He was in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] during the days of [HistoryMaker] Marion Barry I guess.
Speaker 2: Correct, yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  He was the chairman of the Democratic Party?
Speaker 2: Chairman of the Democratic Party, yep.
Speaker 1: And that should be, did you have some interesting conversations with him?
Speaker 2: Wonderful conversation.  In fact, ironically when Tim Kaine was nominated to be, was selected by Hillary [Hillary Rodham Clinton] to be her vice president, Bob called me, he's still active in the Democratic po- politics, and wanted the scoop on Tim.  But, yeah Bob was a tremendous mentor and friend.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We had a lot of fun practicing law, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He did a lot of local government work and that, in fact he, he, he did a lot of local government work and taught a local government class at Georgetown [Georgetown University, Washington, D.C.].  And I'll never forget, he got stuck out of town somewhere and he sent me over with another associate once to teach his class, so.  But, I, I do a fair amount of work now in the local government area, real estate work for local government authorities and other private partnerships.  That's where that interest, but you know that working with him sparked that interest in doing local government work.
Speaker 1: Okay so you, your concept of what a lawyer is, is changing due to these summer internships--
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: --(unclear) in these big firms.
Speaker 2: Yeah, ironically when I first started practicing I was actually a litigator and the first case I worked on was a $450 million antitrust case and McGuireWoods [McGuireWoods LLP] was on the other side, and that's how they became interested in me.  That didn't, you know I didn't come here immediately, but that's how I met this law firm.
Story_ID: 659241
Speaker 1: So, you were--you graduated in '78 [1978] from Howard law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.] and you are hired by Hir- Hirschler and Fleischer [Hirschler, Fleischer, Weinberg, Cox and Allen], right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, correct.
Speaker 1: And okay, and, but you, you left right after, it was about what about four years?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, and I went in with [HistoryMaker] L. Douglas Wilder and Roger Gregory [HistoryMaker Roger L. Gregory].  And Roger Gregory is the current chief judge of the Fourth Circuit [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit], and of course Wilder is former governor, former mayor.  But, I went to work with them when Doug was just getting ready to run for lieutenant governor of Virginia.  In fact, I, I worked on the last case that he tried (laughter) as lawyer.  But, we were able to represent the Richmond School Board and Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority quite candidly because Henry Marsh [HistoryMaker Henry L. Marsh, III] was the mayor and then a fellow by the name of Roy West [Roy A. West] became the mayor and it was a big push in the city to have minority lawyers involved in representing the city and its agencies.  And so having a minority in a law firm put us in a unique position to, to get work from--we actually did work for the City of Richmond [Virginia] as well, school board, and the redevelopment authority.
Speaker 1: Now, now this is, politics was tied to, you know, jobs for black professionals--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --I mean we didn't have, without a local victory you don't have access (unclear)--
Speaker 2: That's, that is true, that is true.
Speaker 1: So many people don't get contracts unless there's a Maynard Jackson or Harold Washington.
Speaker 2: That is true, that is true.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) always somebody in position.
Speaker 2: That is so true.
Speaker 1: So this is--
Speaker 2: You know and I can say you know the experience that I gained working for those clients really, really helped my career, and practicing law is, it's just like anything else you know the more you do it, the better you get, but you, you know it's almost like in sports you gotta, you, you can't just sit there and, and, and study it in a textbook, you gotta do and, and you've gotta have the diet of, of work because it's how you learn especially you know what I do real estate.  I mean a lot of what we do truthfully is not in a book.  You just, you learn it by, by practice.  But, if you don't have a, a consistent diet of work you can never gain, you can never develop the skills and so representing the city, the redevelopment authority, and the school board on a lot of transactional matters really helped me develop skills that you know, that I, that I use now.
Speaker 1: Okay, so okay, so now, so you were with Wilder, Gregory and Martin [Richmond, Virginia] 'cause (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Correct.
Speaker 1: --you were a partner (laughter).
Speaker 2: Correct yes.
Speaker 1: You were with the firm from 1984 to 1990 and so does it, so what happened it just--
Speaker 2: Well, Wilder was elected in '89 [1989] and in December of 1989 McGuireWoods [McGuireWoods LLP] called me and said we'd like for you to consider coming over here, and I was, I joke I was at, you know, Wilder, Gregory, and Martin fat, dumb, and happy and had no visions of doing anything else.  And I said, "Well let me pray about it," and it took me a couple of months before I finally said yes and so in March of 1990 I, I joined the firm here.
Story_ID: 659242
Speaker 1: Okay so McGuireWoods [McGuireWoods LLP] is the oldest law firm in Richmond [Virginia], right?
Speaker 2: Actually probably the oldest in Virginia, dates back to 1839 [sic. 1834].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A fellow by the name of John B. Minor who was affiliated with the University of Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We have a note here it was Egbert Watson (unclear)--
Speaker 2: He was one of the founders as well, but John B. Minor at UVA is a big deal 'cause they have the John B. Minor prelaw society.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they'd rather--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: --rather says he's the one.  Okay, he was a, he probably (unclear), okay, so McGuireWoods is and what kind of work does McGuireWoods (unclear)--?
Speaker 2: Well, it's a full service law firm.  We have a thousand lawyers, twenty-three offices in the United States and abroad.  We just opened an office in San Francisco [California] earlier this year, but totally full service.  We have seventeen departments, several industry teams and I'm in the real estate department, but I do a lot of construction and commercial real estate and what we call public private partnerships and it's, you know a thousand lawyers.  I think we had three hundred when I joined we, we only had one office outside of Virginia and that was in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] , so a lot of growth.  And it's a good place.  I, I, I've enjoyed practicing here.  It's hard to believe that it's been twenty-seven years, almost twenty--it will be twenty-seven in March; it's hard to believe.
Speaker 1: We're sitting in a conference room now with a conference table that's almost as big as a half a basketball court--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --with, that seats about fifty (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Thirty-two.
Speaker 1: Thirty-two, thirty-two okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: I was gonna say more, but I've never seen one this big, you know well yeah it's a big conference room.
Story_ID: 659243
Speaker 1: And so McGuire [McGuireWoods LLP], so what, what was your specialty or what, what is your specialty here?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm a real estate lawyer, but I do a lot of public private partnerships, and for example during the recession when Bush forty-one was president [President George Herbert Walker Bush] we had a real estate recession, depression really, and so a lot of the commercial deals that we all used to do went away.  A lot of the bank loan deals went away.  You might remember you know S and Ls [savings and loan] just completely disintegrated and so S and Ls had historically done a lot of construction lending, so that market just evaporated and in '86 [1986] when Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] was present there was a reform of the tax code and it modified a lot of the provisions that relate to tax exempt finance.  So, the whole real estate market changed.  So, to survive basically what we started doing these public private partnership deals, and the theory is that you've gotta deal that the public sector can't do a loan, private sector can't, private sector can't do a loan, public sector can't do a loan; they need each other to make the numbers work.  And ironically you're generally looking at you know four to five times as much documentation as you would on a traditional deal.  They're very complex, but you got layers of financing, some tax exempt debts, some bank loans, some equity, so forth and so on.  But, they're challenging.  I've worked on deals and literally it has taken us two years to get to closing, but I love it because you have to be very, very creative, you have to be very patient, and, and really think outside the box.  So, that's what I do.
Speaker 1: You've gotta deal with government.  It just--
Speaker 2: Gotta deal with government, right.
Speaker 1: And it takes more patience (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, 'cause things move kind of slow and of course you've got you know the politics.  I mean we had this one deal you know it seemed like every month the deal got delayed because they, they thought they had the votes to approve it and, and then they didn't have the votes and so.  But, there's an area in town called Tobacco Row [Richmond, Virginia] and we did a $150 million bond deal to help stimulate development in that area, and that area has really taken over, taken off rather.  And just south of here there are three buildings, one owned by UPS [United Parcel Service], two owned by SunTrust [SunTrust Banks] and representing a public entity we took an equity position in two of the buildings and all total between those three projects you're looking at about twenty-five hundred new employees and the area south, south of here is called Old Manchester [Old Town Manchester, Richmond, Virginia], but there's just been a tremendous a lot, a amount of development down there.  So it's, you know it's a lot of fun.
Story_ID: 659244
Speaker 1: You mentioned Tobacco Row [Richmond, Virginia].  I just realized that this is one of the tobacco capitals--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --of the country, Richmond, Virginia (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure, sure.
Speaker 1: --and has the tobacco industry I guess with the ban on the cigarettes in the public, you know, in you know the public concourses and you know, and even in the parks you know in some places, has it hurt the cigarette industry or tobacco industry?
Speaker 2: Altria [Altria Group, Inc.] which owns Philip Morris [Philip Morris Inc.] and, and, and used to be just Philip Morris is headquartered here.  But, ironically they were here and they moved to New York [New York] and then they moved back here.  But, they are, you know, diversified now and you know, as you know most of the cigarettes are now sold overseas and especially in third world countries that they really have diversified and you know there have been some that have moved, but Philip Morris still has a tremendous presence here.  I, I'm not a hundred percent sure of the number of employees, but I'm gonna guess about ten thousand, but I'm not 100 percent positive.  But, they're a big employer in this area.

Speaker 1: The economy is diversified more than it had been and so that's helping.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now you mentioned, I mean in the outline, there was a project called the Theater Row project--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --and I've read that that's your favorite project.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And tell us about it.  When did it, did it happen?
Speaker 2: Yes.  That happened back when Governor Wilder [HistoryMaker L. Douglas Wilder] was governor and there was a fellow in town who owned three theaters on Broad Street and he was going to tear them down, and the Richmond historic foundation [Historic Richmond Foundation, Richmond, Virginia] wanted to preserve those theaters.  So, they got an option on all three, but they never could raise the money to buy the theaters.  So, they came to my client and said, "Look can you help us."  And at the time the state was trying to relocate its Department of Social Services [Virginia Department of Social Services], and they actually were prepared to move outside of the city.  So, the city manager went to the governor and said, "Look let us submit a proposal," and they did and they said, "We'll, we'll build you a building and we'll lease it to you."  And so we basically took assignment of this option and acquired one of the theaters, and the Richmond historic foundation basically agreed to contribute a quarter of a million dollars towards the project.  And so we were trying to figure out okay, but they wanted some protection.  So, we were trying to figure out, how do we do this?  We didn't want to do a covenant you know that would run with the land, so we decided to create something called a facade easement, and historic facade easement actually.  It has never been done.  And so basically we agreed to preserve the facade and give them an easement.  And since then that concept has been used all over the country for preserving historic properties.  So, they tore down the building everything except the facade and in, and, and during the entire demolition I was just extremely nervous you know that somebody was gonna do something accidentally to knock down that facade, but fortunately they didn't and so the building was, was constructed and leased to the state.  And, so I guess (unclear)--I enjoyed, I enjoyed finding creative solutions, and that was a creative solution to develop that.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) strange.  In, in my hometown, they actually tried to do the same thing that they did in a news building there.  There was a daily, Daily News [Dayton Daily News] had moved into the suburbs, but the building was left there and it's historic and they, the developer actually knocked the facade--you know he said was an accident.  They actually knocked it.
Speaker 2: Knocked it down.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I don't know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --I mean is there a tension between you know--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, absolutely, absolutely
Speaker 1: --once you wanna preserve the integrity of these buildings.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  And, you know and I think you know the irony is we joke that there's a difference between historic and old.  And some buildings are just old; they don't have any historic significance, they're just old.  But, there are some buildings that you want to preserve, you know, either because it has historic significance in terms of what the use was or the architecture, you know, or both you know and, but you know if it was up to me I would preserve most of the old buildings and, and at least try to, you know incorporate facade or some component you know into, to the new architecture.  I mean personally I think these old, older buildings have more character than the new ones, but it's, it's so expensive to, to kind of replicate that these days, and people don't even try.
Speaker 1: Yeah this, so this Theater Row was the theater district for the--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --City of Richmond [Virginia] and--
Speaker 2: There were three theaters right there on Broad Street, and--
Speaker 1: How far back did these theaters go?
Speaker 2: Oh the early 1900s, yeah.  So, and in fact at, at one point in time there were those three theaters and then there was another one, which became the Carpenter center [Carpenter Theatre, Richmond, Virginia], which was a Loews Theater.  Those were the, the four main theaters in, in the city and that's only about two blocks away.
Speaker 1: They would have been pre-movie house days.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And in fact the Carpenter center is now a performing arts facility.  It is absolutely gorgeous inside, absolutely.
Speaker 1: I think I heard about it from one of your colleagues [HistoryMaker Jacquelyn E. Stone] earlier in the week.
Speaker 2: Yes, and I, forgive me they've renamed it.  It's now the Dominion theater [Dominion Arts Center, Richmond, Virginia], but--
Speaker 1: Right that's the one I heard, right, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I love architecture by the way, so.
Story_ID: 659246
Speaker 1: You were general counsel for the Richmond Redevelopment Hou- and Housing Authority--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: right?  I don't know if you still are.
Speaker 2: I am, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, I still represent them, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay still represent them, right.  And the chair of that is Oliver Singleton, who you mentioned--
Speaker 2: He was, yes.  He passed away about six months ago.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so the Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Well, in most states you have a redevelopment authority and you have a housing authority, but Virginia is unique from the standpoint that the, the two are under one agency and we commonly refer to Title 36 in the state code which creates, well it gives localities the ability to create redevelopment and housing authorities and redevelopment authorities have pretty broad powers.  The original concept was that you would use these authorities to eliminate blight and what we've done historically here in Richmond [Virginia] is we've used the powers of the redevelopment authority to eliminate blight, but then also develop projects that would provide some sort of economic stimulus for the area.  And that the concept is you know you don't just want to eliminate the blight, you wanna make sure it doesn't recur.  And we've done several really, really unique projects in this area.  The redevelopment authority built the original convention center.  I think I mentioned earlier they have an equity interest in two office buildings across the river [James River].  There's an advertising agency here called the Martin Agency [Richmond, Virginia], which has the GEICO [Government Employees Insurance Company] account.  They've had Mercedes [Mercedes-Benz].  They've had BMW [Bayerische Motoren Werke AG].  They've had, you know, Volvo.  It's a tremendous advertising agency and--
Speaker 1: Yeah the GEICO account--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that's a--
Speaker 2: They, they just lost the Walmart [Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.] account.  They had that as well.  So, we helped facilitate the development of their office building down the street through the redevelopment authority.  We've done a lot of neighborhood development.  We did the Tobacco Row [Richmond, Virginia] deal, I think I mentioned that earlier.  So it, the redevelopment side is has, has very, very broad powers in terms of making loans and grants and issuing bonds to facilitate redevelopment, which in many instances meets economic development.
Speaker 1: Okay so--
Speaker 2: So, we've been stretching the envelope and having a lot of fun doing it.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is an aspect of law that a lot of people don't think about.  I know kids don't think about this when the watch television--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --when they watch 'Law and Order' and they see all these, these sensation trials with people, you know, accused of murder and mayhem, but in a lot ways are doing this kind of work.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: And, now do you engage in any kind of a public education around that in the community to let people know what aspect of, I mean what law you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean--
Speaker 1: Young people rather.
Speaker 2: We, we've adopted a school south of the river and I've been principal for a day a couple of times over there and I'll you know answer questions about, I'll, I'll give a lecture and then I'll answer questions about, you know, the, the practice of law.  And you're right, I mean a lot of times, especially elementary school kids, all they think of as a lawyer they, they think of you know trials and unfortunately criminal trials and, and you have to explain to them that there's a lot more to, to being a lawyer than, than just trying cases.  I mean nothing wrong with the folks who are litigators.  You know they're, they're talented and they love what they're doing, but, but the transactional side I think is, is exciting and, and I you know, I love being able to drive around and look at projects that we're involved in.  My kids get tired of me pointing out the projects, but I love doing it.
Story_ID: 659247
Speaker 1: Now you're appointed to ano- I guess in 1998 and I don't know if this is the start of it, but you, there's a series of appointments to university boards--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and--I know you're probably appointed to other boards too, but how, how much of your time is spent as a board member?
Speaker 2: I finished my term on the UVA [University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia] board, so right now I'm on a couple of, well I guess four UVA related boards, two foundation boards, and one board connection, committee rather connected with the bicentennial and the president's advisory board alumni, black alumni advisor board.  But, when I was on the board at UVA that was a lot of time and especially the last two years 'cause I served as rector.  So, it was for all intents and purposes a full time job.
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is a drama, dramatic--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --time and I, we'll go through that.  You--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --started in '98 [1998] is it with--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Blue Ribbon Commission on Higher Education--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and then the James Madison [James Madison University, Harrisonburg, Virginia] board.  And I've also served on the Hanover County Council of PTAs, served on the school board at a private school.  So, I've done it at that level as well, yeah, but education is, is real important.  My grandmother [Martin's paternal grandmother, Charlotte Williams Martin] taught for forty-seven years.  My dad [Henry Martin, Jr.] really, really stressed the importance of education.  I never will forget somebody asked him once, you know, you know about his investments and he pointed to his kids and he said, "Educating my children, that's my investment," so.
Speaker 1: So now these are, these are appointments by the governors of Virginia--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in most part.  But, correct me if I'm wrong they seem to transcend politics on a level.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah that is true, that is true.
Speaker 1: These aren't all Republican governors or Democrats or--
Speaker 2: No, that's true, that is true.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what, what makes you an attractive candidate for these positions?
Speaker 2: I don't know that I can answer that, but for whatever reasons I've been fortunate enough to, to receive various appointments and you're right I mean you know both from Democrats and Republicans, so, but in Virginia at, at least historically I think we joke that most Virginians are really moderates--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and you can kind of see that, you know, in terms of how the elections swing.  There is a fair amount of respect in Virginia for--and you know necessarily being a total independent, but just the fact that you're not necessarily locked into a specific party, 'cause you don't have to register as a Democrat or Republican in Virginia.  So, there are, there are quite a few people that I know that truthfully voted for Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] in 2008 and 2012 and then voted for Trump [President Donald John Trump] in 2016 you know so.  It's I, I (laughter), yeah.
Speaker 1: I don't--I don't know how--we encounter--I, I always like pause--but I know--but yeah there are people that did it, that did that, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I'm serious. I know quite a few people who did it, so, but (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Do you have any idea why?
Speaker 2: No (laughter), no.
Speaker 1: I, I think a lot of people are, are trying you know, trying to dig, dig down deep and try to figure out why (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --this could be true, but I--I know it's true.
Story_ID: 659248
Speaker 1: You were a, you were a member of the Board of Visitors of James Madison [James Madison University, Harrisonburg, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Did anything significant happen?  I mean what was the most significant thing that happened there?
Speaker 2: Well, that was a very interesting time because the [U.S.] Supreme Court was considering the first Michigan case dealing with affirmative action, and, and I never will forget we got an opinion from the attorney general that we needed to repeal our affirmative action program and in the board meeting I basically said why, why are we doing this before the court rules, let's, let's wait and see how the court rules and then we could you know have a special meeting if we have to.  But, they, they, they scared everybody by telling them basically that it was gonna be declared unconstitutional and, and that their personal assets were gonna be exposed and you know we had some fairly wealthy folks on the board.  In fact, the executive vice president with Ross Perot's EDS [Electronic Data Systems Corporation] was, was on the co- he was one of the guys that Perot rescued.  You know so you had folks with, with substantial assets and they got really nervous about it, but fortunately we were able to talk 'em into waiting.  And as you know the court held, upheld the Michigan plan [in Grutter v. Bollinger, 2003].  Ironically, Virginia Tech [Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia], and Bruce Smith was on the board when this happened, rescinded their affirmative action program before the court rule.  Then after the court ruled they had to come back and reinstate it and Bruce Smith in protest resigned immediately from the board.  But, anyway that was, that was one episode where I, I guess being a lawyer helped me because I figured there's no sense in you know pushing the panic button especially before the court rules.
Speaker 1: Now 2002 you were appointed a member of the Board of Visitors at Regent University School of Law.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Right.  And is, that's in Virginia Beach, Virginia--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --which is close by.  So, any significant--
Speaker 2: My good friend, the chief justice Leroy Hassell [Leroy R. Hassell, Sr.] was an adjunct professor at Regent law school, and I was on the Board of Bar Examiners [Virginia Board of Bar Examiners], five member board that licenses lawyers, and they asked me to come down and, and talk to their faculty about the bar exam.  Quite candidly their students were passing at an acceptable level.  And to their credit, I mean I, I basically told them that they needed to go back to basics and that they needed to teach the basic courses that I learned when I was in law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.].  Unfortunately, a lot of law schools have gotten to the point where they were teaching courses that were exciting and sexy, but they weren't, they weren't learning basic property criminal procedure, at least they were required courses you know they were there, but, but not required.  So, they, they literally changed their curriculum and the chief justice was, was on their board as well and, as well as a future governor.  So, they asked me to, to serve and I said yes and I'm still on their board.
Story_ID: 659249
Speaker 1: Now in 2005 you were involved with the National Museum of the Marine Corps.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: This was in, tell us about that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Quantico [Virginia], yes--
Speaker 1: Quantico.
Speaker 2: --it's Quantico yeah.  We represented the foundation [Marine Corps Heritage Foundation] that built the museum and that was a very interesting project because the, the foundation basically raised all of the money.  And as you know I mean the [U.S.] Marine Corps is probably the smallest branch of the [U.S.] military, but in terms of their loyalty to the Marine Corps it's unbelievable.  And I never will forget you know just meeting with the, the members of the foundation board and what have you.  That was a very interesting deal from the standpoint that the [U.S.] Navy owned the land, and most of the time when you're doing a real estate deal you either have a conveyance of the land, which we call a fee simple transfer, or you have a ground lease.  But, the Navy was not going to convey either a fee interest, transfer fee interest or do a ground lease, so we had what's called a license which is basically a contract.  So, they gave a license to the foundation to, only for the construction period, which is really interesting from the standpoint that you know you have the potential for, well I won't bore you with that, but I've never done a deal with a license as the underlying instrument.  So, but once the deal was completed the Navy took over the maintenance of the, of museum.  But, there was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So this is a good thing?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yes, it's a good thing that the Navy took over, but I guess here again you know just dealing with a license was, if, if, be- because they raised the money we didn't have to worry about financing it.  But trying to finance a deal with a license would have been a challenge for a bank because it's just never, is never done.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay and so the museum is open now?
Speaker 2: It is, it is and, yes.
Speaker 1: (Pause) Yeah, they are really loyal.
Story_ID: 659250
Speaker 1: In 2011 you were appointed to the board of the University of Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia].
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: And this is where we really start to (laughter) have a lot of intense acti- activity.
Speaker 2: This is true.
Speaker 1: And tell us about the case of the president, the first woman president, Teresa A. Sullivan.  There was a crisis involving her, and you can--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: And you played a significant role in ameliorating this.
Speaker 2: Well, my father [Henry Martin, Jr.] passed in, on May the 15th of 2012, and the following weekend was graduation, we call it final exercises and then we had a board meeting that Monday and Tuesday.  Well, I buried my dad the day before commencement.  I didn't go to commencement.  And I went to the board meeting on Monday and Tuesday, but I skipped lunch, I skipped dinner.  I, you know, I, I was, wasn't in a mood to socialize, so I skipped all of that.  But, that's when the conversation apparently started about terminating the president.  So, as soon as that board meeting was over I flew to Florida to work on the deal and as soon as I finished that deal I got on a plane and flew to South Africa.  And I was on the executive committee, but did not get notice of this special meeting that the rector [Helen Dragas] called on a Sunday and the president was terminated.  So--
Speaker 1: Now the rector is like the chairman of the board.
Speaker 2: Like the chairman of the board, the rectors yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: The Board of Visitors is the same as the board of directors.  So, we were actually supposed to go to Cape May [New Jersey] my favorite vacation spot and I had to tell my daughters [Hayley Martin, Kelly Martin and Mallory Martin], "I've gotta go to South Africa 'cause this client wants me to go for two weeks," but I told the client I could only stay for ten days.  So, they cried when I told them we had to postpone the vacation.  So, when I got back from South Africa it was the Saturday before Father's Day and we were supposed to leave immediately after that and go to Cape May, but we had a special board meeting, so I had to tell them again, "We're gonna postpone vacation"; they cried.  So, went to this special board meeting, which lasted until 2:30 in the morning, got home about four, got a couple of hours sleep, and we drove to Cape May.  The whole time I was in Cape May, I had just gotten back from South Africa I had my international BlackBerry, my normal BlackBerry, and my iPad and I was on one of those the entire time basically trying to put the genie back in the bottle.  And in fact my oldest daughter put all three devices together at one point, took a picture, and said, "Dad, next vacation can you leave one of these at home?"  But, basically we decided to reinstate the president.  Now, I will tell you when I was in South Africa we got six thousand emails from faculty, students, and alums, almost all of them opposing the action that was taken to terminate the president.  And I didn't read all of them, but I don't sleep all that well when I travel, so I, I read a lot of those emails and on the flight back from South Africa I knew that the right thing to do was to reinstate the president.  So, basically during that time I had a leadership role, if you will, in terms of reinstating the president and, and as a result, well the person who was the vice rector [Mark Kington] resigned during that and so as a result I was then elected vice rector.  And the way it works at UVA we elect a vice rector and that person automatically becomes the rector.  So, in 2012 I became the vice rector and then in 2013 I became the rector.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is you know quite a, yeah, this is, so this is, ironically it would seem to me that the rector was a woman and so is this--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --first, was, was the rector the first?
Speaker 2: She was the first woman to serve--
Speaker 1: Woman.
Speaker 2: --as rector, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And the President Sullivan was the first woman--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --to serve as president of UVA--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --which, and we didn't mention this before University of Virginia became coeducational in '72 [1972] your second year.
Speaker 2: Actually in '70 [1970].  My--
Speaker 1: Seventy [1970].
Speaker 2: --the year before I went, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay before, okay all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My, my first year was only the second year that, that they had women.  They had some nursing students in graduate schools, but for the most part this was the, that was the inaugural year.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it just seems strange that a public uni- is, is the University of Virginia a public--?
Speaker 2: It is public, yes, yes, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  Yeah, it just seems strange that a public university would be gender segregated at any time you know.
Speaker 2: That, that is true, that is true.
Story_ID: 659251
Speaker 1: As you become the rector, soon there's another crisis right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the, the fall of 2014 we had a student by the name of Hannah Graham who went missing and ultimately was found murdered and that made national news. The irony of all ironies is we had a board meeting on Friday, September the, it was either the 11th or 12th and she went missing that night.  Later that semester, November the 19th, Rolling Stone published a horrible article ['A Rape on Campus'] about a rape that never occurred on grounds.  The irony is that same meeting on September the 11th or 12th, the woman who wrote that story was at our board meeting.  I didn't know it at the time, but she was there.
Speaker 1: And this is, her, her name is Sabrina--
Speaker 2: Erdely [Sabrina Rubin Erdely].
Speaker 1: Erdely right.  This, this story was broadcast on all--
Speaker 2: Yep, yep.
Speaker 1: --the major news networks, CNN, CBS, NBC, ABC.
Speaker 2: I had a friend in England who sent me a copy of a newspaper, my picture in the paper.  Another person in Australia told me they saw my picture in the paper.  It was in The New York Times, you know everywhere, and you know candidly when I read the, the, the article in the paper I thought there's something about this that just doesn't make sense.  I mean and for example the article claimed that the woman who was raped was led to this fraternity house by a date and someone--she was a lifeguard and apparently he was a lifeguard and that's how they met and, and then the, the woman who was the victim claimed that a couple of days after this occurred she had an encounter with the guy who led her to the fraternity house and he said, "I enjoyed the other night we're gonna do that again," or something crazy like that.  I was like nobody does that, you know.  But, you know here again you know you're still thinking okay there may be aspects of it that are exaggerated, but it turned out that the whole thing was, was false.  The woman was, had a crush on a guy, and she was trying to make him jealous and so she made up this whole story for some crazy reason thinking that this would, would get him to like her.  And I don't know if you saw '20/20,' I guess it was a couple of months ago they had an interview with the, the, the guy that was the affection, the object of her affection and, and you know and some of the other students, so, but it was all false.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: The difficult thing for the school, our communications folks tracked it, you know, every day and at the height of the negative story there were like 450 articles, the height of the negative story.  After the retraction, the height was seventy-five, so not everybody obviously learned that it was a bogus story.
Speaker 1: And bad news really spreads and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the public I think has a tendency to believe the worst about college hijinks and stuff, you know I mean not that something like this would be a--
Speaker 2: Sure, sure.
Speaker 1: --hijinks, but it's the kind of thing that the public tends to believe about college students--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --that they drink a lot--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --they, you know, do a lot of crazy things on campus, you know, they're unsupervised and unmonitored or whatever.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: The fraternity [Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity] actually was, was banned right, or, or--?
Speaker 2: Well actually not.  What happened the Inter-Fraternity Council basically told all of the fraternities to cancel their social activities, and, and then the president [Teresa A. Sullivan] basically said you know I support that and we're gonna extend it.  Now the irony is by this time exams are starting, so you really shouldn't have any social activities anyway and, and she extended it until the first day of the second semester.  So, but in the media it was reported that she banned the fraternities, but she really didn't and I think, and unfortunately, but so then after the story, after her, after the story was retracted, then you had a lot of the fraternity folks who were upset because they thought she had taken harsh action against the fraternities.  But, you know, sort of like you know don't read just the headlines, read the whole story, so.  We have a lot of that as you know in our society.  People don't pay attention to the details.
Speaker 1: You were quoted as really being tough on the, the media. The- they said (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --the, the journalism was poor--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in this situation.
Speaker 2: Yeah we, we labeled it drive by journalism and it, it really was.  And, and from what they showed on that story on '20/20' a couple of weeks ago and then obviously the testimony came out in the trial [Eramo v. Rolling Stone, LLC] the--one of the deans [Nicole Eramo] sued the- sued Rolling Stone and she won $3 million.  They really didn't do a whole lot to, to look behind, you know, with, with traditional fact checking.  I mean they really just dropped the ball, and the Columbia School of Journalism [Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, New York, New York] did a report and really blasted Rolling Stone in terms of the, the lack of professionalism and ethics.
Story_ID: 659252
Speaker 1: I mean, well, people appreciated your efforts apparently and don't, I don't mention this award lightly because it has historical significance.  You, you received the Raven Award in 2015.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And it's, it's an award given by the University of Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia] by the Raven Society right?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Which is named because of--
Speaker 2: Edgar Allan Poe.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right
Speaker 1: Who was a--
Speaker 2: Student at UVA.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now I didn't know this 'til I--
Speaker 2: Okay yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --saw this outline you know but it's, yeah that's something I, 'cause I--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --always associated him with Baltimore [Maryland].
Speaker 2: That's right, yeah but he actually ironically at one point lived in Richmond [Virginia] 'cause there was a Poe Museum [Edgar Allan Poe Museum] down here as well, but he lived was, we, the Lawn is a central grounds and the Rotunda is at one end and then you have student rooms lining the Lawn going towards, facing towards Monticello [Charlottesville, Virginia], which was Jefferson's home [President Thomas Jefferson].  And the outside of that is called the Range [Range Community] and that's where graduate students live and so Poe lived in one of the rooms on the Range and it was an honor to live in those rooms.  So it's now, it's a mini-museum, but, but the Raven Society is UVA's oldest honor society, honorary society.
Speaker 1: Okay and you also received--
Speaker 2: But what was important to me was I got the award with a woman by the name of Vivian Pinn.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Vivian Pinn graduated from UVA's medical school [University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, Virginia] in the '60s [1960s], and she was the only black and the only woman in her class and she was my hero.  So, it was an honor to get the award, but it was an even greater honor to be recognized along with Vivian Pinn.  And in fact UVA just renamed one of the buildings at the med school after her [Pinn Hall].
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Dr. Vivian Pinn.
Speaker 2: Dr. Vivian Pinn.  And she at one point tau- taught at Howard med school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay and then you received some kind of Jasper Trailblazer Award [John Jasper Trailblazer Award].  Is this your church?
Speaker 2: No, it's an old church in Jackson Ward [Sixth Mount Zion Baptist Church], which is an historic area in Richmond.  And John Jasper was a famous minister.  Literally people would come from New York to hear this guy preach.  He was just a phenomenal minister.  When they were building Interstate 95 because of the historic nature of his church they, they were going to basically tear the church down and build a highway, but because of the historic--because of him, they basically rerouted 95.  So, so literally it's right on the edge of, of 95 now because of him, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Have you ever considered running for office?
Speaker 2: I joked that the only place I'm going to run is home.  But, when I was young, yeah, I thought about it, but I really am not interested in running for.  I don't think my wife [Anita L. Martin] would (laughter), would like that idea too much.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I do like policy and that was one of the things I really enjoyed about being on the board at UVA and at James Madison [James Madison University, Harrisonburg, Virginia] is being involved in developing policy.  That's something I really enjoy.
Story_ID: 659253
Speaker 1: We always ask this question.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well, I had joked that when I was young it was cool to be smart and now days just being candid especially with a lot of young black men it's not cool to be a good student and I mean I went to, because my grandmother [Martin's paternal grandmother, Charlotte Williams Martin] taught at George Washington Carver, I went to George Washington Carver Elementary School [Richmond, Virginia] and I was literally in the heart of the city.  It's, it's not the ghetto today, but when I was a kid it was the ghetto and you know it was cool to be smart.  I mean one of the guys who was in my class is an Old Testament Hebrew scholar.  I, I spoke at his church recently, and he read the genealogy of Christ and he read every name in Hebrew, brilliant guy.  But, he grew up in that neighborhood and there were a lot of kids, you know from that neighborhood, you know who, who have done extremely well.  That's just one of the concerns I have.  You know and, and I, I have three daughters [Hayley Martin, Kelly Martin and Mallory Martin] and I must say you know the, the guys that I see just don't seem to be quite as serious as the girls.  And, and I, you know don't get me wrong, I know that there are a lot of black young men out there that are focused and so forth and so on, but I just feel like there are a lot of folks who really think it's not cool to, to be smart and I'm a firm believer that education is key for African Americans.  And I know that's something my dad [Henry Martin, Jr.] stressed and I know that you know regardless of where you are in life today if you get an education, get a good education, you work hard, you can be successful and, but I, I really believe for the black community, education is still critical and, and I, I just am concerned that we're not putting as much focus on it today as, as, as we used to, so.
Story_ID: 659254
Speaker 1: Do you have any thoughts about the, the future of the public schools?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, what did Einstein [Albert Einstein] say, if you keep doing something and expecting it to work and it doesn't and you keep doing it that's a sign of insanity?  I mean I think we ought to recognize that what we're doing is just not working.  And I mean if, if, if, if it was up to me you'd go to school from eight to five [o'clock], elven months of the year and we'd have smaller classes, you know better ratios in terms of people to teacher, pupils and just really, really try to attract the best and the brightest to teach.  I, I think public education is, is critical not just to the black community, but just you know in general and you know I've, I've spent a fair amount of time in Africa and I, one of the things I really like about the places that I've visited in Africa, they really seem to have a much stronger appreciation for education than we do.  And, and you see people sacrifice, I mean really, really sacrifice for their kids to get an education and I think we unfortunately take some of those things for granted, but, but yeah we've gotta change what we're doing.  And I don't, you know I'm not gonna say that charter school is the end all, but if that works, then let's, let's try it.  We definitely need to do something different.
Speaker 1: Now have your African travels been basically a function of work, counseling clients--
Speaker 2: For the most part yes, for the most part yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay and have you spent the most time in South Africa or in West Africa?
Speaker 2: Most, most in South Africa, but I've, I've been to Zambia as well and I will, I, I, I just did the DNA test and just learned that 31 percent of my ancestors came from Cote d'Ivoire and, and Ghana.  So now I wanna go to Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana, so.
Story_ID: 659255
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point in life, you still have some time left (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I hope (laughter), I'm planning on it.
Speaker 1: Would you do anything differently if you could go back and change something?
Speaker 2: You know the only thing that I regret is when I was a fourth year student at UVA [University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia], I did not live on the Lawn.  That's the only thing I think I regret, and I was the only African American selected to be a senior resident and I was talked into doing that, which meant I had to pass on the Lawn.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, that's, that's probably the only thing I, I regret doing--not doing.
Story_ID: 659256
Speaker 1: Likewise, when you look back at everything do you, what do you consider today to be your, your crowning achievement or legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, it would have to be my kids yeah.  I'm really proud of my girls [Hayley Martin, Kelly Martin and Mallory Martin].  So, I have two at UVA [University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia] now and one in the eleventh grade and I'm really, really proud of them.  They all have a very strong spiritual base and my two oldest are involved in a group called Chi Alpha [Chi Alpha Campus Ministries], which is a Christian fellowship and oldest has not been home for spring break.  She, every spring they go on a mission trip and my daughter who is a first year student is planning to go on a mission trip this coming spring.  My youngest has been to, is ver- very active in Young Life and just got back from Young Life retreat and she was in New York last summer in a camp.  So I'm real proud of where they are from a spiritual standpoint as well as where they are from an academic standpoint, but, but, so I'm real proud of my girls.
Story_ID: 659257
Speaker 1: Now you got married somewhere along the way, right and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I did (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, we didn't mention it, but--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --when did you get married and how did you meet your wife?
Speaker 2: The irony is I met Anita [Anita L. Martin] at a party, a Valentine's Day party that was given by Doug Wilder's nephew who, his nephew grew up a half a block away from me and, and we got engaged on Valentine's Day as well.  So, she's a, she, she grew up in Norfolk [Virginia] and former computer analyst so I, I, I learn a lot from her so.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And she's very organized, extremely organized and a good mother, good wife.
Story_ID: 659258
Speaker 1: Now what advice would you give young law students today, I mean black law students?
Speaker 2: Probably two things, one you know there's no substitute for hard work.  I mean you've gotta put the time in.  But, the other thing that I would tell them is consider the joint J.D., M.B.A. degree because if you, if you, especially if you're gonna end up doing transactional work, it's good to have an M.B.A. and it also gives you flexibility.  But, but you've gotta work hard and, and there's really and especially in today's market it, it's harder to get a job coming straight out of law school today than it was when I was coming out [from Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.] and law firms are a lot more selective now days than, than they used to be.  So it, it, it is, it's a little bit tougher and so you're not, if you don't have good grades it's gonna be very, very hard to get a job.
Story_ID: 659259
Speaker 1: Do you have a legal philosophy?
Speaker 2: A legal philosophy okay.  (Pause) That's an interesting question, a legal philosophy.  Well, I think in terms, I mean I, I, maybe I'm not answering your question, but the First Amendment is very, very important to me and there are plenty of instances where you might find the conduct or the statement to be objectionable, but I still think we have to defend the right of the person to say or do what, what they're doing because the First Amendment is very, very important.  And, and, and I'll give you an, an example just recently some faculty and students at the University of Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia] criticized the president [Teresa A. Sullivan] because she post-election quoted Jefferson [President Thomas Jefferson] in a letter that she sent to the students and, and they basically told her, directed her not to quote Jefferson anymore because he was a slave holder.  Okay, I agree you know Jefferson has a, he's a contradiction in many respects, but she has the right still to quote Jefferson and they have the right to not like it, but she still has a right to quote Jefferson.  And, and I think that the letter would have been okay if they just said we don't like the fact that you quote Jefferson and just leave it at that, but to direct her not to do it anymore, you know that, that's where you're infringing on her free speech right.  And, and, and you have to say okay suppose the shoe is on the other foot.  Suppose as a president she's directing them not to say certain things, would have been a major uprising, so, but, but I, you know the First Amendment is, is very, very important and I think we've gotta be careful.  And I, and I will say you know, in part because my parents were very, very active in the Civil Rights Movement.  I know how important the First Amendment is to, to black folks and like I said you may not like what people say, but you have to understand that you know it, it, it is still very, very important.
Story_ID: 659260
Speaker 1: Is there anything I have not asked you about we need to discuss before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Is there something, did I ask you enough about the Wilder campaign or, I mean it keeps, I keep thinking maybe I didn't ask you enough about it, but did, did you, were you active in, in that--?
Speaker 2: I was and I have a funny story to tell you about the Wilder campaign.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Wilder [HistoryMaker L. Douglas Wilder], especially when he was running for the lieutenant governor, I mean he basically had a shoestring budget and somebody loaned him a paneled station wagon and he and another guy literally drove all across the state you know campaigning and his campaign office was our law office and we were in a building in the East End [Richmond, Virginia], a really, really great storefront that had been restored.  And the media kept saying well we want to see your organization and you know his organization was this, this guy that drove the station wagon (laughter) and his son, and his son, and, and those of us in the office you know that were helping.  So he said okay well you can come by on a certain night and so basically we were all in our offices and they told us to you know act like we were talking on the phone so that the reporters couldn't ask us questions and someone said, "Yeah that's So and So in there. He's," you know, "calling some supporters now," and so you know went around all the offices but, but all the offices were occupied by the lawyers not, not necessarily folks involved in the campaign.  But, he really ran that on a, on a shoestring and it was a, you know, a phenomenal strategy.  But because he didn't have the money to run a lot of ads on TV, he had to get out on the road and that turned out to be just, you know, the, the, the difference made, the difference for him because there were a lot of people who probably would not have voted for him if they hadn't had the opportunity to see him in person and shake hands with him and you know so it really was, ironically it was sort of like the same kind of strategy that Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] used you know in terms of, of his you know organization and, but for Doug it was primarily driven by finances, but it turned out to be a brilliant strategy.
Story_ID: 659261
Speaker 1: Are we ready for the last question?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The last question is similar to legacy, but a little bit different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well I'd, I would like to be remembered as someone who loved God, loved his family, and loved practicing law.  Someone who took time to, to give back to the community and someone who appreciated the time that others sowed into my life and someone who hopefully made a difference in the lives of other people.
Speaker 1: Okay, well thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Okay, thank you.

Speaker 1: That's a photo of my wife and my three girls at the place in Cape May [New Jersey] that my great aunt and great uncle bought in 1941 and Cape May is my favorite destination for vacation, and when my middle daughter, who's on the right saw it for the first time, she said, "Daddy is this--was this the first house that God made? It's so old."
Speaker 2: This is from Virginia Business magazine.  Every year they have a publication dedicated to the Virginia legal elite and they highlight about six lawyers, and I was selected for construction for the most recent addition of the magazine.
Speaker 1: This is a plaque in the Rotunda at the University of Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia] and it's a listing of all the individuals who have served as the rector of the university and the rector is the same as a chairman of the board.  Technically the University of Virginia is a corporation.  The name of the school is actually the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.  The first rector was [President] Thomas Jefferson and the second rector was James Madison [President James Madison, Jr.] and I'm listed there from 2013 to 2014.  And one quick joke I tell sometimes when Jefferson was on the board there were three former presidents, Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe [President James Monroe], and I used to joke I didn't have three former presidents, I just had three billionaires.
Speaker 2: And that's a picture with Tom Farrell [Thomas F. Farrell ll] who is a former rector of the University of Virginia and current chairman of Dominion Resources [Dominion Resources, Inc.].  Tom is a former McGuireWoods partner [McGuireWoods LLP].  We were actually classmates at, well we were at the University of Virginia together and this is at a baseball game at UVA.
Speaker 1: That was taken at black alumni weekend, and the woman in the picture is Terry Sullivan [Teresa A. Sullivan], the current president and the fellow in the white hat is Dr. Conyers [Charles Conyers].  He's on the faculty at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  And next to him is Blake Morant [Blake D. Morant] who is the dean of the law school at George Washington University [George Washington University Law School, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: That's a picture of a class that I teach at church.  I've been teaching five years old since 1986, and that class is called kingdom kids.
Speaker 1: That's a picture with the current governor, Terry McAuliffe.  He was the commencement speak for final exercises in 2015 and as the rector you have the opportunity to make remarks at graduation, but you also introduce the speakers.
Speaker 2: That's a plaque that is outside of Gibbons House and this dorm was dedicated, I dedicated this dorm in June of 2015.  We named this dorm after former slaves at the University of Virginia.  UVA was only the second school in the country to name a dorm after former slaves.  University of North Carolina [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina] was first.
Speaker 1: So Gibbons was--
Speaker 2: Well, it's a husband and wife, William [William Gibbons] and Elizabeth Gibbons and--I'm sorry Isabella Gibbons, Gibbons, and they had been slaves actually of some of the professors at, at the university.
Speaker 1: That's just a picture with my family on my most recent birthday.

Speaker 1: That's a picture with Justice Clarence Thomas and my partner Jackie Stone [HistoryMaker Jacquelyn E. Stone] and in the background is the wife of a former chief justice of the Virginia supreme court [Supreme Court of Virginia].  This was literally taken three days after my youngest daughter was born.  One of my partners was sworn in as the president of the Richmond Bar Association, and Clarence Thomas was the keynote speaker and I was on the program as well.
Speaker 2: That's a picture of my family with Governor Wilder [HistoryMaker L. Douglas Wilder], my brother Anthony [Anthony Martin], my mother, my father [Henry Martin, Jr.], and Governor Wilder taken in the executive mansion.
Speaker 1: That's a picture of my wife, Anita [Anita L. Martin], and my dear friend, Patrice Motsepe.  Mr. Motsepe owns African Rainbow Minerals [African Rainbow Minerals, Ltd.], which is a large mining company in South Africa, but he worked for McGuireWoods for three years and I was his supervisor.  He is now a billionaire and it was a joke at one point.  In fact, he was in Forbes magazine, on the front cover of Forbes several years ago.  And as a joke how do you become a billionaire you work for George Martin.
Speaker 2: And that's my wife Anita, my daughter, my daughters, Kelly, Mallory, and Hayley and that is at the University of Richmond [Richmond, Virginia] after one of their piano competitions.
Speaker 1: That's a picture with Russell Wilson who is the starting quarterback for the Seattle Seahawks.  And Russell's father used to work at McGuireWoods.  In fact, he was one of my dear friends.  He started here a month before I did, and Russell was a member of my church.

Speaker 1: Oh you did.  Okay well his, Russell's father is Harrison III [Harrison Wilson III].
Speaker 2: That's a picture with my daughters one Easter, and the thing I like about the picture is my father literally bought those dresses.
Speaker 1: That's with George Allen when he was in the U.S. Senate, and the gentleman in the middle who was at the time the president of the Tuskegee Institute fellows [Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].
Speaker 2: This picture was taken at the South African embassy.  Thabo Mbeki is the gentleman standing right next to me who is the former president of South Africa and the fellow in the middle is Richard Nixon's brother.
Speaker 1: Donald Nixon.
Speaker 2: I can't remember his first name.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: He's an engineer and went to NC State [North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That's a picture with my family again, taken again at church.
Speaker 1: That's my middle daughter.  One day she put on my coat and my tie and she said, "I am Mr. Lawyer."  She's now a first year student at the University of Virginia.
Speaker 2: And that's a picture of my dad at one of my re- one of the recitals.
Speaker 1: That's a picture with George Allen when he was a partner here at McGuireWoods.
Speaker 2: His father [George Allen] is coach, right?
Speaker 1: Washington Redskins and the Rams [Los Angeles Rams].  Patrice Motsepe again and we had a dinner to honor him as an outstanding alum and I'm presenting him with his gift.
Speaker 2: And that's Bob Washington [Robert B. Washington, Jr.], a mentor, and a dear, dear friend.  He was the managing partner of Laxalt, Washington [Laxalt, Washington, Perito and Dubuc] and before that a firm called Finley, Kumble [Finley, Kumble, Wagner, Underberg, Manley, Myerson and Casey], which at the time was the largest law firm and I worked for, for him my last year in high school.
Speaker 1: That is a picture of my class at church in the early days.  That was taken back in the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: And that's a picture of me when I graduated from high school, Thomas Jefferson.
Speaker 1: That's my mother Ruby Grant Martin with President Bill Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton].  And as I mentioned earlier, Hillary Clinton [Hillary Rodham Clinton] worked for her.  She hired her when she was at the Children's Defense Fund.
Speaker 2: And that's a picture of me when I was fourteen years old at Thomas Jefferson High School [Richmond, Virginia].
Speaker 1: This is a picture of the Board of Visitors when I was the rector taken in 2014.  The other thing that's significant about this picture is this was our last meeting in the board room before they began the renovation of the Rotunda, and you also note that I'm the only African American in that picture.
Speaker 2: Recently Discover Richmond, which is part of the Richmond Times-Dispatch, they recognized thirty individuals that they thought had contributed significantly to the Richmond [Virginia] community and I was selected as one of those thirty individuals.
