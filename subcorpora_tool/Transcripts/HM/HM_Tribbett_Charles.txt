Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: It's Dorris, D-O-R-R-I-S, Morris, M-O-R-R-I-S.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she spelled the Dorris just like the Morris.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth is, is May 20--and let's see, she is seventy-five.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that would put her in 1929, I think?
Speaker 2: 1920--1928, actually, I think.
Speaker 1: '28 [1928], okay, all right, okay.  Well, and where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Louisiana, Alexandria.
Speaker 1: Okay, Alexandria, Louisiana, all right.  Okay, well, what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side?  How far back can you trace the ancestors on your mother's side of the family?
Speaker 2: Well, my, let's see, my mother and--my, my great--my grandfather [Howard Morris] was one of the first black real estate agents in Alexandria, Louisiana and married my grandmother who came from--she came from Oklahoma.  And they met up in Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So your father [sic, grandfather] became one of the first black real estate agents.  Now, this is the first part of the century then, right?
Speaker 2: It is.  It goes back quite a ways.
Speaker 1: The twentieth century.
Speaker 2: Back in the town of Alexandria, too small, it was small back then, and obviously, it's grown more, but my grandfather went around as a, as a real estate agent and, and hooked in with all of the black owners of homes.  And there weren't that many, as you can imagine.  A lot were renting.  And, and he would go up to them and he would say, "Listen, when you're ready to sell your home, come to me, and I'll help sell the house."  And, and then he would hook into all of the black neighborhoods.  And when you're ready to, to rent a home, I have homes that you can rent.  So he'd take a little bit of money, and he'd buy small homes, and then he would rent those out to blacks that were moving into Alexandria, and no other black did this at the time.  And he was one of the first in Alexandria to do it.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did he have to get a license and all that?
Speaker 2: He did.  He got his license.  And, and he was the first, one of the first blacks to have the license and became very popular back then.  Everybody knew who he was, and I, as I remember, before he had passed away, he had five homes, small homes that, that he gave to each one of us.  And we eventually gave them back to the estate, but it was his way of, of having something for the family--had us all. The homes had very little value back then, but, but they were worth something for the estate.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he was passing down a legacy in terms of--.
Speaker 2: He did.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, where is Alexandria, Louisiana, and is it near New Orleans [Louisiana] or?
Speaker 2: Alexandria is right near Baton Rouge [Louisiana].  It's about thirty minutes south of Baton Rouge.
Speaker 1: Okay, is that going towards Southern or away from Southern University [and A&M College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana].
Speaker 2: Southern University, actually, my mother went to Southern University.  It's going, it's going toward Southern University.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's near Scotlandville [Louisina] and all that?
Speaker 2: I don't know Scotlandville.  I left Alexandria when I was two years old.  So I haven't really spent a lot of time there.
Story_ID: 20086
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Dorris Morris] talk about growing up in, you know, in Alexandria [Louisiana] and what it was like for her?
Speaker 2: Well, yes, she did.  Alexandria, back in those days, there were white restrooms and black restrooms, and, and my mother's one of four children, and so I think--and my mother's very fair skinned.  And my uncle, her brothers, are a little darker skinned.  And she talked about days where she would get away with going into a, a white restroom, when it was available, but that her brothers and, and her parents could not.  And it was tough times for her, tough times for the family.  And, but she talked about the days when she saw the transition from moving out of discrimination and the separation of restaurants and buses and, and bathrooms to where all could stay in the same room and all could go to the same restroom.  And we talked a lot about, you know, she wanted me to appreciate the times that I live in today and, and how discrimination might be today compared to what it was when she was growing up.
Speaker 1: Okay, and she was a young adult, I guess during the time of the, most of the civil rights activities?
Speaker 2: She was.
Speaker 1: Right in, in Alexandria.  Now, you said your mother went to Southern [University and A&M College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  Did--so she had a chance to school.  Was that typical of the members of your family?
Speaker 2: It is.  They all went to school.  And they all graduated and, and went into different directions.  My mother ended up marrying my father [Charles Tribbett, Jr.] and moved right away to Chicago [Illinois].  And her brother, two of her brothers moved to Chicago.  One became a pharmacist, one became an insurance agent and, and the third is still in Alexandria.
Speaker 1: Okay, is there a, is there any--do you have any sense of how--and the family's, and you've got most of the family members going to college.  That's pretty, you know, that's pretty good in the black community in those--.
Speaker 2: Back then it was exceptional.  It was to, to my grandmother and grandfather's credit.  It was unusual, actually, to finish college back then and to get a job and to have a good job.  And so I think they were, they were considered a little bit more on the upper scale back then because of the success that, that my grandfather had in the real estate business.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, when you--are there any stories in the family of how the family became successful after coming out of--I know they, I guess they had to come out of the same situation everybody else did, slavery and all of that and Reconstruction; any stories about how--?
Speaker 2: On the, on my mother's side or on my--with the grandfather?
Speaker 1: On your mother's side.
Speaker 2: Not that I can remember.  I mean I know that, I knew it was tough times.  I know my grandfather struggled quite a bit.  And I don't know how he ended up getting into the real estate business.  I think it was mainly because there were, not jobs that he could get into because of discrimination and it was easier for him to get into, on the real estate side because blacks lived in, in and rented homes in that area and, and needed to move from one place to another, and there were blacks coming in Alexandria that, that needed to find a place to stay.  And I think that, at that point, it was, you ought to talk to, you know, my, my grandfather.  And so his name became pretty popular back then to, to talk to--talk to Morris, you know, he, he would, he would set you up.  He'd give you, you know, find a place for you.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what was his full name; his first name, I guess?
Speaker 2: Howard Morris.
Speaker 1: Howard Morris, okay, all right.
Story_ID: 20087
Speaker 1: Tell us about your father and his side of the family.  What's your father's--well, I--we know what his name is, I guess.
Speaker 2: His name is the same as my name [Charles Tribbett, Jr.].  He, it's a only doctor in front of it because he's a, he's a dentist.  He grew up in New Haven, Connecticut and, and went to dental school and went into the [U.S.] Army.  Back then it was easier to go into the Army and, and get your education and, and come out and conduct your--and devote your time to service for a while and then practice.  And so he, he went to--he got his degree, then went into Fifth--the Fifth Army back then, which is based here in Chicago [Illinois].  It's the old 5050 Lake Shore Drive building.  I think it's a hotel now, but there are two towers that were there.  And those two towers, before they were there was the Army headquarters and, and the minute he got out, he went and did his time and--and that's actually one of the reasons why we, we stayed in Chicago because when he finished his, his tour of duty at, on Lake Shore Drive, he decided to move out to, to the West Side to establish his practice because back then, the West Side of Chicago was predominantly the, the minority side, African Americans, predominantly lived on the West Side of Chicago.  And we never could, could afford to live on the North Side of Chicago, which was predominantly back then white.  So we moved to the South Side of Chicago, and lived there and that's, that's where I grew up.  And he established his practice back, back on Madison Avenue.
Speaker 1: Okay, so his practice was on the West Side, and you all lived on the South Side?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, what do you know about the ancestors on that side?  How far back can you trace your father's ancestors, I think, in New Haven?  I mean was--?
Speaker 2: Well, my, my, my grandfather on my father's side was, I believe one of the first African Americans to enter Yale University [New Haven, Connecticut].  He got his degree in electrical engineering, which back then, very few blacks had.  I don't know if he was the first, but I know he was one of them.  And, so he was either the first or one of the first five that attended, that attended Yale; finished his degree there and set up a, an electrical company on his own, as an electrician, serving the New Haven, Connecticut area where he got his, got his degree.  And, and that's, that's--and he was one of the few blacks, I think, that was an electrician back in those days.
Speaker 1: So, he was more than just an electrician if he went to Yale, right?  He was like an electrical engineer or something like that?
Speaker 2: He was an electrical engineer, but as you probably can recall back then, blacks couldn't get jobs.  And, and even though he graduated from Yale, it was easier for him to set up his own business and serve as an electrical engineer opening up his own company than it was to, to work for General Electric Company or some of the other large companies.  So he immediately set up his own business, and, and did his tour around the New Haven neighborhoods, knocking on doors, saying, I can help you on any electrical issue that you have, and eventually was able to buy a truck.  And I think it was called Tribbett Electricians and became reasonably successful on it, enough to, you know, enough to live in a nice home, not an extravagant one, but a nice one and held the, held that company up until probably about seventy years of age.  And then we, then he moved to Chicago here for a few years before he passed away.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, are there any stories about the ancestors on that side?  I mean how far--do they go back pretty far in New England or are they from further South or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, on his side, the, they go back pretty far, predominantly on the, on the East Coast side.  And I just don't know how far back they go.  I do know that there are very few Tribbetts in the United States, and there are still some that are located in Boston [Massachusetts] and, and some that are in Bermuda actually.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and what's your father's date of birth and--he was born in New Haven, but what is his date of birth?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'd have--I don't remember.  I'll have to come back and give that to you.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  But when he was in the army, that was like during the Korean War or--?
Speaker 2: Well, he was in the Army--he passed away in 1978, and I would go back, oh, twenty-five years, and I'd say, he entered the Army probably about thirty or thirty-five years from there.
Speaker 1: Okay, let's see, well--thirty-five years before he passed, he was in the Army, you think?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause I think he practiced up until the time that he passed away and, in Chicago, and he was only in--he was only there for about five years.  I think that's, that's sort of the time period that you stay in the Army and then you move out, and, and go to work.  And I--.
Speaker 1: So you're saying--.
Speaker 2: And I, actually, I was born shortly after that.  So, and at my age of forty-nine, he probably came out of service some time--I don't know, probably about, I'd say it's probably in the '50s [1950s], 'cause I was born in '55 [1955].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay.
Speaker 2: So, I, I suspect that, that he came out probably around '58 [1958], '59 [1959].
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's like, that's like after the Korean War.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Between, you know, I guess Cold War activity we're talking about now rather than any real war, I mean hot war. So they--okay, so where--.
Speaker 2: It was closer to the [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] period because I, I think when Martin Luther King died in Chicago, we had riots all through the West Side of Chicago.  And there were Korean shops as you go from the North Side of Chicago all the way to the West Side, down Madison Avenue there.  You start with white-owned shops and some Korean shops, and then you end up in the minority area, the African American neighborhood and where they're black shops.  And, and I remember it when the riots occurred.  Right after his, his death, the second day, my father and I drove down Madison Avenue to, to get to his, to get to his office.  And African Americans were all over the streets, just turning over cars and, and--but we were fine because he was very well known in that area because he was a dentist that took care of, you know, people's teeth.  And, and many times that they didn't have the money to pay, and, and he would let 'em go and said, pay me when you can.  And a lot of them came back and they'd give cash.  They didn't have checking accounts, so they'd give him cash, and say, is this enough?  And he would say, that's fine.  And so I think he became known as a very caring person on the West Side of Chicago.  And then so, I remember that back in the '50s and '60s [1960s].  I was quite young then.
Speaker 1: Now, where did he go to dental school.
Speaker 2: Well, he went to Howard University [Washington, D.C.] and Atlanta Dental School [now part of Emory University].
Story_ID: 20088
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Growing up, my early, my early childhood memory really goes back to living in Alexandria [Louisiana] for a couple of years and spending time with my, my grandfather [Howard Morris] there and then moving to Chicago at a very young age and just growing up predominantly, really on the South Side of Chicago.  So when I grew up, we were fortunate enough to, to go to Catholic schools.  And so I shared a little bit of that memory with you as I was growing up, on the days when [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] died and, and following my father [Charles Tribbett, Jr.] down to his office and seeing the riots that occurred.
Speaker 1: But what I was asking about, do you have an earliest childhood memory?  What's the first thing that you remember or can you remember what the first is that you remember?
Speaker 2: Oh, the first thing I remember.  Well, the first--my memory goes back to--I probably was five, four or five years old, in Alexandria, fly fishing with my grandfather, catching catfish and coming back with catfish, which I didn't catch.  He caught 'em (laughter).  But I was there with, with all of his buddies, and we, we came back, we hooked 'em, and Alexandria for Louisiana was a, is a town where everybody, all black--they all knew each other.  They were all friendly.  They had great times together, and they were always all together.  They ate together, they partied together, they socialized together.  And so when I was young, I was always on my, my great-grandfather's lap and always in the middle of a whole of people having a great time.  And I'll never forget.  That's, that's sort of my earliest childhood memory back when I was, I don't know, four or five years old.
Story_ID: 20089
Speaker 1: You grew up on the South Side of Chicago, what neighborhood did you grow up in?
Speaker 2: I grew up in Chatham.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, Chatham has a reputation of being one of the cleanest, safest--in those days, the place where even people like Ernie Banks lived--.
Speaker 2: Mahalia Jackson, Ernie Banks, we were very fortunate because we lived in a very nice neighborhood.  It was very safe.  And as I said, we went to school there.  I grew up there.  And I loved the area.  And today, most of the African Americans that, that lived in that area are still in the Chicago area.  We all went to parties together.  We all saw each other at churches together, and, and it was a great area.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it still is.  It still has survived.
Speaker 1: What are some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, the sights for me, really were, were really on the South Side of Chicago, looking at, at schools like Kennedy-King [College, Chicago, Illinois] grow, you know, being built and looking at, back then, the, the best schools, if you didn't have a, the money to go to the private schools was to go to the Catholic schools.  And we went to some of those Catholic schools, and, and it was a good education and participating on, in little league and, and, you know, in that area, in the Chatham area, it started off as a white area and gradually became a black area, so that, so I grew up in an area that became almost exclusively black.  And most of the individuals in that area were like my father [Charles Tribbett, Jr.].  They were either dentists, they were doctors or they were lawyers, and they all knew each other.  And so I grew up among that group.  And back then, whites didn't really socialize a lot with blacks.  So blacks formed their own social organizations, and there were--these organizations were called the Assembly, the, the Druids, the Snakes, they were all different organizations, but it was exclusively for blacks.  And that was their way of getting to know each other better, to, to meet and, and have dinner together and to have to Christmas parties together and to bring spouses together, and, of course, to bring children together.  And, and those are the memories that I have and being part of a family where you get to meet other families that are black, that are going to the same schools, that are living in the same neighborhood, and none of them lived on the South side, none of them lived on--I'm sorry--none of them lived on the North Side.  They didn't live on the West Side.  They were all concentrated somewhere between the Chatham area, which is around 83rd [Street] and Calumet [Avenue], almost going all the way over east, almost to the Lake [Michigan].
Story_ID: 20090
Speaker 1: Now, how would you describe yourself growing up?  Now, do you have any brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: I have one, I have a sister.
Speaker 1: One sister, okay.  Are you the youngest or the oldest?
Speaker 2: I'm the youngest.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So how would you describe yourself growing up?  What kind of little kid were you?  What were you interested in?  What did you like to do?
Speaker 2: Well, for me it was basketball, and I grew up and lived outside.  You know, I lived on the basketball courts out, by our house [in Chicago, Illinois], and, and, you know, I'd, it--we were very family-oriented, and so we spent a lot of time with our family.  We'd go on vacations together.  And my sister and I were very close.  We spent a lot of time together.  We went always to the same schools together, up until we got older.  So I, I think it's really just, you know, walking up and down the neighborhoods, you know everybody.  You know the other kids that are around your age, and our lives were intertwined in playing basketball and having fun outside.  I mean that's really what I did as I grew up.
Speaker 1: Now, did you have a favorite basketball player when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: No, I, you know, I, I don't think I had a favorite basketball player.  I mean today, you know, we, we all grew up in the days where Michael Jordan became very successful over the last, you know, years, a few years ago.  No, I think it was really just, really being out on the street and, and on the South Side, just playing ball, getting to know people.  It's just, it was just the thing to do back then.  I, I didn't read a lot.  I didn't watch TV a lot.  I went to school, and, and then I'd go out to the, to the basketball courts, various public schools around there.  CVS [Chicago Vocational High School] was around there at the time, and we'd go and play there, and you'd play against each team that you, you know, you'd get a group of people together and you'd play against each other.  And, you know, and I eventually went to high school, and I played in high school.  And it just became a lot of fun.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in Chatham church is really big.  I think it's really big.  So, you know, you go to church every day--every Sunday and, as a matter of fact, the pastor of the church ended up marrying me and my, my wife.  And for us, it's, after, after church it's, you know, you go to Sunday class and Sunday class for us, is, is really, it goes in the evening, and it's, it's really just spending time with the friends that you're with, that grew up in Chatham.  We all go to this, you know, this church together, and, and so really I think it was an, it was an important part of our lives.
Speaker 1: And what church did you attend?
Speaker 2: I went to the Presbyterian church, the Universal Presbyterian Church.
Story_ID: 20091
Speaker 1: Now, where is the Presbyterian church that you attended?
Speaker 2: The church, our church was on--Ken Smith was, was our pastor, and the church is on 78th [Street] and--I think it was 78th and King Drive [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, now, this is Kenneth Smith who was on the school board.  Is that the same Ken Smith?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Ken Smith, actually, it's a great story because Ken and I got to know each other well.  And when I left Marquette University [Milwaukee, Wisconsin] and went to the University of Virginia [School of Law, Charlottesville, Virginia] for law school and came back to Chicago, Ken was one of the first people that I talked to.  And it was Ken, at the time, that was the president of the school board and on the--he was, I think at one point, the president of the Chicago Urban League.  And he said, "Charles, one of the things you need to do is you need to do is you need to get on, on the board of the Urban League."  So he introduced me back then to Jim [James] Compton, who was running the Urban League, still is the president of the Urban League.  And I was young at the time, but Jim was courageous enough to put me on the board of the, the Chicago Urban League, of which I've been on ever since.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Ken went on, I think, then to become the president of the Chicago Theological Seminary, and, and then he retired from there a little while ago.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  I know there aren't that many black Presbyterians in Chicago, but there's a--there are enough.  And they have a significant history, going way back.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah they do.
Story_ID: 20092
Speaker 1: Yeah, so did you like music when you were coming along?
Speaker 2: I liked music.  I, you know, for me, it was just the general pop music.  I listened to a little bit of jazz, not a lot, but most of, most of my friends who were back then, you were listening to the music of the '60s [1960s] and the '70s [1970s].  So, you know, it was just the same old, you know, The Four Tops, The Temptations, Smokey Robinson.  You know, back then, those were the, the hit, the hits that you listened to.
Speaker 1: Okay, what about television?  Did you ever, did you get a chance to watch much TV growing up?
Speaker 2: I, I watched TV, but I wasn't, I wasn't a big fan of TV.  I mean I watched the general movies that would come on.  Most of my time back then in, in growing up was really spent out, outside and over another person's house playing pool or socializing, but--you know, and I worked when I was young, but never really sat down and was a, you know, a person that watched TV every, every night.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was there, and it was fine.  I'd, it's nothing that I can say that I, I, I did the most, was not watching TV.
Story_ID: 20093
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what about school now.  Where did you attend grade school?  What was your first school?
Speaker 2: The first school I attended was Neil, Neil, Neil Elementary School [Chicago, Illinois].  Neil is--.
Speaker 1: Is that N-E-?
Speaker 2: N-E-I-L.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and Neil is, is on--it's on 83rd Street, a couple of blocks east of, of King Drive [Martin Luther King Drive, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then I, then I went to a school called St. Dorothy's [School, Chicago, Illinois].  St. Dorothy's was, St. Dorothy's was on 78th Street, a couple of blocks east of--and about three of our blocks east of King Drive.  And I actually finished St. Dorothy's and, and went, went to Mendel [Catholic Preparatory High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so--.
Speaker 2: Mendel is on 111th [Street] and King Drive, and went there for four years.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, when you look at school, back at school, did you like school when you--?
Speaker 2: Yes, I loved school.  I mean school for me was where you met your friends and many of the friends that I had that lived in our neighborhood, we went to the same school.  And if we didn't, we went to rival schools.  And a lot of them went to the Catholic schools so while I was at St. Dorothy and Mendel, some were at other schools and we competed against each other in basketball and football.  But it was, it was a lot of fun.  I enjoyed school, still enjoyed it through college and enjoyed it through law school.
Speaker 1: Now, did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: For me, you know, I, when I was in high school, my, my favorite subject was, was math, it was geometry.  When I was in grammar school, my, my favorite subject was probably history.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, are there any teachers or--that served as mentors to you or were particularly important in your development was you were growing up?
Speaker 2: You know, I--the answer is probably not.  I was this, I was a student that played around in school.  I was not your best student.  I didn't become your best student until I, I learned in, in Mendel in the last year that I needed actually to go to college and, and became a very good student in college.  But throughout St. Dorothy's and throughout Mendel, I just had fun.  I mean I, if anything, the, the teachers were must more talking to my parents about how you need to get your son to pay attention and not get in trouble, than, than rewarding me with A's and B's in my classes.  So I, I had a great time, let's just say, in, in high school and had a great time in grammar school because I didn't do all the work.  I didn't realize back then that school is as important as, I think it is today.  But as I said, I think I, I think I learned at the last minute that it was, enough to get into a, a good college and then go from there.
Speaker 1: What kind of things would you do to get in trouble?  Did you really get in trouble a lot?
Speaker 2: Oh, I got in trouble.  I clearly got in trouble.  I would--a teacher, I remember when I was in St. Dorothy's, and a teacher turned his back in our geometry class.  And, and one kid across the, across the classroom would, would give me the finger.  And the other kids were, a little smirking and the teacher would--turned around, and he didn't know what was going on.  And, and so I decided to give the kid the finger back.  At the same time, the teacher turned around and looked at me, thinking I'm giving him the finger.  I get called out of the classroom.  They called my parents, and even back then, Catholic schools were very strict.  They didn't tolerate that.  You go directly to the principal.  Principal calls your parent, calls, you know, a parent comes in.  And what has he done, and, you know, it's--that was the typical me.
Speaker 1: That seems like more of a misunderstanding, than really--.
Speaker 2: Somewhat of a misunderstanding, but I did it.  You know, I remember another time when I, you know, you put a little spitball in a straw and you blow it out and it goes farther when you put it in the straw than when you just, you know, wrap it up and throw it; did that all the time.  And, of course, I'd get caught for that.  And--.
Speaker 1: Well, that's pretty bad.
Speaker 2: --never, never, never fights.  You know, I was not the kind of kid that was always beating up or getting beat up.  It was always just something devilish.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so did you have a lot of friends in school growing up?
Speaker 2: We had, I had a lot of friends.  You know, you, you know, for me, I, I enjoyed working with a small group of people, and I had a lot of friends that knew.  And, and then there were a core group of people that lived around our house and we went to school together and, and, and we actually grew up together, up, up until high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, at Mendel Catholic, did you play basketball?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did play basketball for the first year at Mendel.  Then Mendel actually got pretty good in basketball, and so I, I had to switch over and play intramural; I couldn't make it to the varsity junior and senior.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So they had a pretty good team then?
Speaker 2: They did.  They played against the, you know, Hales Franciscan [High School, Chicago, Illinois] and, and Leo [Catholic High School, Chicago, Illinois] and, and all the other schools.  And back then, Hales was a great school.  I mean it still is now, so we really, you know, you had to be pretty good at Mendel to play, to play in varsity basketball.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so what other activities were you involved in, in high school?  Did you get involved in other things?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we, outside of basketball, I just did track.  You know, I ran and, you know, those were, for me, those were the two outside activities that I ended up doing.
Speaker 1: Was Mendel a primarily African American populated school?
Speaker 2: Mendel, when I, when I joined Mendel, Mendel was mixed almost evenly between whites and blacks.  Mendel was a school that you had to wear a, a sport coat and a tie, and you had to wear khakis.  That was the rule, freshman year when I joined.  By the time I left, Mendel became probably 70 percent black.  And they got rid of the sport coats and the ties.  You had to wear a collared shirt, it didn't have to be khakis.  And, and then eventually Mendel ended up closing, the consolidation of Catholic schools.  Mendel was one of the ones that was consolidated.
Speaker 1: Now, Mendel, we were discussing before we started the interview how interesting a place is.  I mean when I first came to Chicago, I didn't know what it was because there was a big fence around it, a lot of land, describe the campus for us?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Mendel is a--it was a beautiful school.  I mean I, I thoroughly enjoyed Mendel.  Mendel started off on 111th Street, and actually, it started off on, on, I think it was 109th [Street] or 108th Street, and went all the way up to 111th Street.  It, it, it took up a huge amount of land.  It had a lake in the middle.  It had three large buildings.  One large building was just the gymnasium and swimming pool.  The land in back was enough to have two, full-sized football fields, plus a track, plus a baseball field.  And then in the front, the lake was a lake that goes about six feet deep, and probably went across a good thirty feet and in width it was a good, about 500 feet or so; trees all around.  You really thought you were at a college.  It was called Mendel Catholic Preparatory School.  And it was actually a good school.  It was hard to get into, but I, I ended up getting in.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, right near Palmer Park, and--.
Speaker 2: It was.  It was right near Palmer.
Speaker 1: Yeah, across from King--.
Speaker 2: It's actually near the Pullman community because it's the old Pullman Bank was right nearby there, which is a, what was--back then was a white neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Well, I think that's still--it's either Mexican and white now, I think primarily.
Speaker 2: It may have moved into Mexican.  Back then, it was predominantly white and it was--it's not too far from the Lake [Michigan].
Speaker 1: And that's part of the historic Pullman community set up--.
Speaker 2: It is. Yes.
Speaker 1: ---by George Pullman of the Pullman [Palace] Car [Company]--.
Speaker 2: And the Pullman Car, and it, part of that are, east of Mendel is a historic district because of the Pullmans.
Speaker 1: That's right.  He created his own community for his workers. Yeah, you know, so it's a lot of history over there.  So, you said that when you were a senior, you kind of started to grasp that high school was about going to college (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, when I was a senior--I actually, started when I was a junior, in my second semester.  And everybody around me started thinking about college.  And, and I, you know, I knew I had to go to college.  I just didn't know what the deal was.  The deal was you had to have good grades to get into a good college.  And so, and I had C's and, and probably C's and D's is what I had.  I was the great--the best of students and I didn't think I, I needed to be.  I think it was probably in my second semester, junior year, when I talked to my parents, and I talked to the counselor at the school--I don't even remember his name, who said if you want to get into a college, you're gonna have to demonstrate at least in your, your second semester, junior year, and your first semester, senior year, that you know how to get B's and A's.  So immediately I changed.  I was no longer a bad student.  I learned where the library was, and, and I got straight B's.  This is junior year, and second semester.  First year, senior, I got all A's and B's.  And, and then I applied to Marquette University [Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  It's Jesuit school, and so two Catholic schools, coming from Mendel, going to Marquette, was a plus.  And I was on the cutting edge of acceptance of Marquette.  They, they wanted to meet me.  They wanted to talk with me.  I remember being at home and Marquette, the, one of the admissions directors called me at home to ask if I was very serious about going to Marquette because my grades were not--they were, they were at the--on the fringe.  And then I finally remember getting in.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you graduated from Mendel in '72 [1972].
Speaker 2: '73 [1973].
Speaker 1: '73, okay.
Story_ID: 20094
Speaker 1: You started Marquette in the fall of '73 [1973]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, Marquette's in Milwaukee [Wisconsin]?
Speaker 2: It is, downtown Milwaukee.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you--had you considered any other schools other than Marquette?
Speaker 2: Marquette was the one.  You know, it was a recommendation from Mendel [Catholic Preparatory High School, Chicago, Illinois].  And they thought that I'd be a good student there.  There were a few kids that they recommended to go to Marquette, and I think, primarily because of their recommendation and, and showing good grades in the last two semesters, it worked.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well, what was it like for you?  What was Marquette like?
Speaker 2: Marquette was--I loved Marquette.  I mean I was at a time when Marquette--basketball was the place to be at Marquette.  I don't know if you remember this, but when I graduated from Marquette, Marquette took the NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association] Championship.  Al McGuire was coach of the year, and if there's any place you wanted to go, you wanted to work for--you wanted a coach--you wanted to be a basketball player with Al McGuire.  He was phenomenal, and I was there.  And I remember camping out freshman year all night long to wait for tickets because tickets were, were rare to come by.  All the students didn't get in, and Marquette was probably about seven or 8,000 students at the time, and they only got about 4,000 tickets.  And it was phenomenal.  I, I really enjoyed Marquette.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you know Bo Ellis?
Speaker 2: I knew Bo Ellis and, and I remember when Al McGuire recruited Bo Ellis, and I remember when Bo changed the uniforms at Marquette.  He was--the first time, when, when he decided to, to have--I don't know if you remember the, the, the pants, you just rip 'em right off.  And Bo Ellis came up with an idea for Marquette that we ought to have, have, you know, the pants where you just rip 'em right off, and you have your shorts.  So that you don't have to pull 'em all the way down.  And it was a big deal for Al McGuire who said, I'll let you do this Bo, and he designed 'em.  And it was a lot of fun.  It's a lot of fun.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, yeah, yeah, that was, yeah, that big--I remember that championship team.  Now, what did you major in at Marquette?
Speaker 2: I majored in political science and I minored in economics.
Speaker 1: Okay, and did you have a career goal in mind when you decided to major in political science?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my, my thought was I wanted to be a lawyer.  I knew my father was a dentist.  I thought about going into medicine, but I just loved political science.  And I loved economics, microeconomics, macroeconomics.  I took a lot of those courses, and I just thought this would be more enjoyable.  And it was a great path to go, become a lawyer.  They had a good--I had great counselors at Marquette, and, and I did very well at Marquette.  So I think a number of people said, you can go anywhere you want, you know, you should go to law.  Now, the interesting thing is back then, I never got guidance to do anything other than being a lawyer or a doctor.  No one said anything to me about, you could be a real estate agent.  You can go to Johnson and Johnson [Inc.] and be a sales agent, or go up the marketing track of Kraft [Foods Inc.] or there's Procter and Gamble [Co.], that has a great training program.  I didn't know any of that.  All I knew back then--and, and partly from growing up in, in Chatham [Chicago, Illinois], was that, for blacks, you wanted to be law--a lawyer or you wanted to be a doctor.  Now--in hindsight I think I, I didn't get great counseling because today, I tell my children there're tons of places you can go.  You don't have to just be a lawyer, and you don't have to be a doctor.  You can be an investment banker.  You can go on Wall Street.  I didn't know any of those options.  So I chose law.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, how did you interested in economics?
Speaker 2: Well, I like math and, and so part of the microeconomics and macroeconomics had a little bit of math components to it.  And it seemed to, to blend very well with political science; understanding how the governments work and then understanding how economics, you know, how, how to create modeling back then was fun for me.  It was fascinating for me.  I had some great teachers that I admired a lot.  And--.
Speaker 1: Who were some of those teachers?
Speaker 2: Well, one teacher was my economics teacher, Hinkey (ph.).  And he was great.  I mean I took all of his courses, and, and they were all in economics.  He liked me.  You know, when you find a teacher you like, you take the courses over and over, all the courses that they teach.  And I, I took his courses, and it was--probably that was one of the reasons why I ended up, ended up getting it as a minor because I took so many courses, I had, it became a minor because my--initially, I just wanted to be a political science major.  I thought it was something that was enjoyable.  I, I liked history, and I liked politics and political science, it's kind of putting history and politics together and learning a little bit more about the government and how governments are, are shaped with the judiciary system and congress.  And, and then I had a great teacher for economics.  And I just kept taking different kinds of economics courses where I had enough to make it a minor.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So when you were on the verge of--now, did you participate in any other activities on campus?  Were you--did you run for class officer?
Speaker 2: I was your typical bookworm at Marquette.  I totally changed from Mendel.  Mendel taught me how to have a lot of fun, but it also taught me at the end that if you want to become successful, you have to get good grades.  So at Marquette, I didn't--I mean I joined the chorus, but I--if anything, I lived in the library.  I graduated from Marquette with almost a straight A average.  I became Phi Beta Kappa, magna cum laude.  I was one of the few blacks that had one of the highest scores at that university.  And to, and to this day, I stay very close to the, to the president over there and to the, to the university.  I, I became very--knock on wood, I had become very successful at Marquette, learning how to do nothing but study.  So I went to their basketball games, I mean everybody did.  I was very patriotic.  I loved the school.  I had a great roommate.  His name was Jim Irvin (ph.).  Jim Irvin was a, a white guy whose father was a, a dermatologist.  Jim and I became roommates from my freshman year all the way to my senior year, and, and to his credit, Jim graduated from Marquette, with nothing less than an A average.  He never got an A minus.  He, he, he graduated number one in his class.  He became a doctor.  He went to University of Chicago Medical School, and we became great friends.  And he taught me the importance of getting good grades.  He taught there because he got straight A's, and he studied so much, we studied together.  I never had to worry about parties.  We went to parties.  He was in the chorus; I joined chorus.  We became great friends in the chorus.  We toured around singing all throughout the United States with the chorus.  So, you know, we got a little bit of that.  We went to all the basketball games, but I never joined a fraternity.  It's just something I, I was just too busy studying.  Teachers loved me (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, it seems like a--that's really a big turnaround from grade school.
Speaker 2: That's exactly what it was.  It was a turnaround.
Story_ID: 20095
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So when you were on the verge of graduating from Marquette [University, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], what--had--you decided to become a lawyer, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, at that time, it was a clear-cut decision, apply to law school.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was your ultimate goals.  Was it to be a trial lawyer or to be involved in some other--?
Speaker 2: My, my goal was, you know, you can either be a litigator or you can be a corporate lawyer.  My goal was to be a corporate lawyer, and not a litigator.  Initially, I thought about being a litigator.  I thought it would be kind of fun going through the court system and, and litigating, but at that point, I learned about, I learned about Wall Street, and I learned about how lawyers have an impact in doing mergers and acquisitions, and working behind the scenes and representing investment banking firms.  So I clearly went to law school to become a corporate lawyer, a transactional attorney.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So how did you choose the University of Virginia [School of Law, Charlottesville, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: UVA?  Well, I had a, I, I applied to a lot of schools.  I applied to Georgetown [University Law Center, Washington, D.C.].  I applied to Yale [Law School, New Haven, Connecticut] , I applied--I didn't apply to Harvard [Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], but I applied to Northwestern [University School of Law, Chicago, Illinois] and I applied to UVA.  I got in all of them.  I was very fortunate.  I went to UVA, and if you go to Charlottesville, Virginia, you will absolutely fall in love with it.  It is historic.  It is gorgeous, one of the most beautiful campuses in the world.  It's just phenomenal.  So I--and, you know, the other schools were great.  And, and I knew that UVA was one of the top ten law schools in the country.  And I, my goal was to go to one of the top ten, and I also knew that when you graduated from UVA, 99 percent get into Wall Street jobs.  And so I felt that's all I really wanted to do.  I wanted to go to a great law school, and I wanted to get a great job in New York.  That was my plan.  And I--that's what I did.  So I went to UVA, and I really enjoyed it.  I met great friends there.  I married when I was in my first year, and, and eventually, went to Wall Street.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, where did you meet your wife?
Speaker 2: That's another story.  We grew up together.  We grew up--when, when my parents moved to Chicago [Illinois], my mother's brother, who's my uncle, lived also in Chatham.  And his next-door neighbor was my wife's family.  And so we were, we grew up close.  As I told you before, we all socialized together in the Chatham area, and we went to school together.  Well, I, I would always go over to my aunt and uncle's house, and my wife, Lisa, and her family was always over there or that my uncle was always over their house.  I mean they were right, literally, they were right next door to each other.  So we kind of grew up thinking we were brother and sister for a while.  When we turned fifteen, fifteen, sixteen, we started dating, and the rest is history.  We, and then we dated only each other.  I went to Marquette.  She went to Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois].  I went to law school my first year.  She got her master's at Northwestern, joined me at Virginia, and we got married.
Speaker 1: Well, that's the way it ought to happen (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's the way it ought to be and we've been married ever since.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That sounds the way it ought to work.  Now, let's see I had a--okay, so, well, were there any particular teachers at the University of Virginia law school or experiences that, that shaped your development as a lawyer?
Speaker 2: Well, there were teachers that I got to know well, and I admired.  You know, they're--one was a black professor.  He taught tax [law], and, and as a result, I took a lot of his courses.  His name is Sam [Samuel C.] Thompson [Jr.], and he was a great teacher.  Everybody loved him.  It was hard to get in his class.  I think he eventually left UVA and became the, the dean of the law school of--a school out in California.  We lost track after a while, but I learned a lot from Sam.  He was a very bright man, and, and we spent time together.  He was married.  I got to know his wife, and he really taught me the importance of, of being a good lawyer, being prudent, of not making judgment decisions quickly, but taking a step back before you give an answer.  And he taught me a little bit of tax on the side because he was a tax lawyer.  I almost thought about becoming a tax lawyer, until I decided I just really wanted to be much more corporate and not tax.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so any other experiences in Virginia that stand out before we--?
Speaker 2: I liked Virginia.  Virginia was a, is a great place.  And if you haven't been there, you should go.  My son is now a junior at the, the college there.  Virginia also is a very discriminatory area.  You know, it's, it's part of the South, and so when I was a freshman at, at, at the law school, the country clubs there would not allow blacks in.  And when Virginia interviewed to--when, when law firms came to UVA to interview the students, a lot of them would interview at these clubs.  I couldn't go to those clubs.  I wasn't allowed in.
Speaker 1: So this is in the mid-'70s [1970s], but you're still, they still wouldn't--.
Speaker 2: I, I finished--.
Speaker 1: This is late '70s.
Speaker 2: --Virginia in 1980.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is '77 [1977], '78 [1978].
Speaker 2: This is, this is, this is '78 and '79 [1979].  And by the time I, when I graduated in 1980, they opened it up to minorities.  I don't remember which minorities were, became members of some of those clubs, but I do remember interviewing on campus, as opposed to in those clubs.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, you know, having said that, you know, Virginia, and my, my class, we had, I don't know, out of over a hundred plus lawyers, there were probably about a good fifteen to twenty that were African Americans.  And a few of them are here in Chicago that I, I stay in touch with, every--periodically.
Story_ID: 20096
Speaker 1: What did you do, did you have a job lined up right after, after law school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's--for [University of] Virginia [School of Law], they--New York really likes Virginia lawyers.  And I was able to get a job right away at a, at a firm on, on 40 Wall Street called [Thelen] Reid and Priest [LLP].  It was an old, very old-line firm, and, and Charlie [Charles] Reid hired me.  And Reid and Priest represented all the utility companies.  So Mississippi Power and Light [Company] and Florida Power and Light [Company] and Duke Power, and pretty much Reid and Priest had a lock on doing all of the 1935 Act [Public Utility Holding Company Act] work for, for these utility companies.  So I became a, a securities specialist representing utility companies.  And then I, I did that for--.
Speaker 1: One second, I'm sorry, just let that siren dissipate.  Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 2: I became a securities specialist at Reid and Priest.  I did that for two and a half years and decided that I just did not want to become a utility lawyer, and it was time for me to move on.  So I, I left Reid and Priest at a time where we, we'd had our first child, who was born in New York.  And it was just our decision to move back to Chicago [Illinois], so I moved back to Chicago.
Story_ID: 20097
Speaker 1: You're at [Thelen] Reid and Priest [LLP], and you decide you don't want to be a securities--I mean a lawyer for the big utilities?
Speaker 2: I did, and I decided that it was time to come back to Chicago [Illinois].  I shouldn't say I decided.  I think my wife [Lisa Tribbett] and I both together decided that New York is a great place, but we love Chicago.  And our family was in Chicago.  So we packed our bags, and, and I, I joined one of the largest law firms here in Chicago.  It's a firm called Mayer, Brown and Platt [now Mayer, Brown, Rowe, & Maw LLP] and, and became a, a corporate lawyer.  And Mayer Brown represented a lot of banks, one of which, I think the First National Bank of Chicago.  So I did a little bit of banking work at the time, and, and stayed there.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what--when did you come back to Chicago?
Speaker 2: 1983.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well, what was it like at Mayer, Brown and Platt?
Speaker 2: Mayer Brown was a great firm.  In fact, Bob [Robert] Helman was, was running the firm, I think, as the managing partner.  I got to know Bob well.  I, I--he's a great friend now.  So I've known him for many years.  I ended up working for the public finance group at Mayer, Brown and Platt.  That was the, the group that does all of the municipal bond financings.  Back then, they were industrial revenue bonds that were used as a means for municipalities to, to get money.  And, and so I was a lawyer behind their preparing all the documents.  There was a, a partner whose name was Wayne Whalen who I got to know real well, and, and Wayne was in charge of the, of that group.  And I stayed until, until a, a Wall Street firm named Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom [LLP] approached Wayne and, and a few others and said, we, we're thinking about opening an office in, in Chicago.  Skadden was one of the largest merger and acquisition takeover firms in the world, and, and many would say it was the number one firm in the world; competed against another law firm called Wachtell, Lipton [Rosen and Katz LLP].  Those were the two that owned the market.  And they approached Wayne Whalen and, and some others and said, we want you to, to open an office for us here in, in Chicago.  And so Wayne and, and a few partners from Mayer, Brown and Platt, a few of his partners, split off of Mayer Brown.  It was a huge deal back then, and, and they went around and, and talked with a number of associates.  I was an associate and said, "We'd like you to come over with us."  And, and so I left Mayer Brown and joined Skadden Arps, and stayed at Skadden up until--.
Speaker 1: Now, how do--say that slowly and spell it for us--Skadden--.
Speaker 2: Skadden is S-K-A-D-D-E-N, Skadden Arps, A-R-P-S.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.
Speaker 2: So I left Mayer Brown, joined Skadden Arps, and--.
Speaker 1: Now, what year is this, I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: We are now in 1985, I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Stayed at Skadden from 1985 to 1988 doing transactional, corporate work.  It was great.  I loved it.  Skadden grew from a very small firm to well over a hundred lawyers, and probably has two, three hundred lawyers in Chicago now.  Wayne Whalen is to this day still running that office, and has done phenomenally well.  There are still a number of partners that left Mayer Brown that are still the founding partners for that Chicago office.  I, on the other hand, met a, a friend--met an individual who I became friends with.  He was a, a money manager, and, and he was at Neuberger and Berman [LLC], which is an old-line money-management firm.  He was not African American.  He was white.  And he wanted me to help him set up his own money-management firm, which I began doing when I was a lawyer at Skadden.  But he then eventually said, "I'd love it if you could come with me and set up an M and A part of our investment firm."  And, and I agreed to do that.  So I left Skadden in, in '88 [1988] and, and joined--his name is Brett Brubaker, joined Brett.  And he and I formed a, an investment firm and called Abraham and Sons [Capital Inc.].  And I stayed there for, up until 1989.
Story_ID: 20098
Speaker 1: When you first came to Chicago in '83 [1983], that was right on the cusp of the Harold Washington [mayoral] election.  It was a big--it was an exciting time for black Chicago.  Can you tell us about that and how that--was he already elected or was he in the campaign when you got here?
Speaker 2: Well, when I came, Harold was running.  And, and he became mayor.  And, and I got to know him as mayor when I was at Skadden, Arps [Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP].  Actually, it was Wayne Whalen who was running the office of Skadden who introduced me to one of the mayor's confidantes.  His name was Tom Coffey back then.  Tom and I had, we had dinner at a, a sushi restaurant, and, and Tom introduced me to the mayor, and the mayor asked me to, to serve on the board of McCormick Place [Chicago, Illinois], which is now called the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority.  Well, back then, the state legislature had pretty much fired the board of McCormick Place for improprieties.  And they had to appoint a new board which was an interim board to build the new McCormick Place Building.  I think it was building number two.  The mayor had, the, the mayor could choose three directors.  The governor could choose three directors, and the governor and the mayor together could agree upon a chairperson.  So the mayor chose me as one of the directors, and I served on that interim board for eighteen months.  That was the deal, stay there for eighteen months, build the new building and then we'll reconfigure the board.  So I stayed for eighteen months under Washington and he and I got to know each other reasonably well.  After the eighteen-month period, Mayor Washington asked me to, to stay on and serve as chairman of the McCormick Place.  So I stayed on and, and served as chairman of McCormick Place for another--up until Mayor [Richard M.] Daley became mayor.
Speaker 1: Now, what are your reflections on Harold Washington.  You got, you said you got to know him pretty well, so--.
Speaker 2: I wasn't his best friend, but I obviously needed to spend a fair amount of time with him on issues relating to McCormick Place, which was significant issues back then.  And Mayor Washington is--he was, he was extremely charismatic.  I spent a number of times with he and I at his home, talking about issues relating to McCormick Place, getting his guidance.  And he was a master politician.  And I learned a lot from him.  I was young, so I was a young individual, serving as the chairman of a fairly prestigious organization, McCormick Place, at a time where the press was all out to get you, and at a time where McCormick Place is run by unions, and so you had a lot of union issues.  And you had a governor back then, and that was Governor Jim [James R.] Thompson who had appointed Governor [Richard B.] Ogilvie who was, the former governor, to become a trustee.  It was a newly-created position.  It really was the, the governor's way of saying to, to, to the late Ogilvie, here's a job for you.  It was a paying job, just to sort of watch over me and McCormick Place.  And, and I learned actually a lot from Governor Ogilvie.  He was a, obviously, he was on the Republican side, but he and I became good friends.  He was a lawyer at one of the prestigious firms here and, and so it was actually, it was actually Governor Ogilvie that encouraged me to, to go out and find a general manager.  See, at the time, McCormick Place, when I was the chairman, did not have anybody to run it full time.  They needed a general manager.  The governor wanted to put in somebody that he knew.  Mayor Washington did not think that was a good idea.  Mayor Washington wanted to, to put in an independent person.  And so right before Mayor Washington died, he said, "Charles, whatever you do, I really think you need to, you know, go out and find the right person.  Don't put a person that, that, that the governor wants.  Don't put a person that I want.  Put somebody in there that actually can turn this place around and make a difference."  The other thing the governor--the mayor told me was, people are gonna tell you that the mayor said this, and the mayor wants you to do that.  And he said, "Don't believe them.  Believe me.  If you have any doubts about what people are saying I said, call me up, here's my number; here's my, you know, my address at home.  Call me up and just ask me because you're gonna find a lot of reporters that are gonna tell you things.  You're gonna find a lot of people that know me that say I'm very good friends with the mayor and this is what he wants you to do.  Don't believe any of it.  Come to me directly."  And I learned a lot from him.  He was an important part of my life.  I spent a lot of time at McCormick Place, and as you can imagine, as a lawyer at Skadden, half my time was at McCormick Place.  The other half of my time was being a lawyer, working around the clock at Skadden.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's interesting, you know, that--.
Speaker 2: It's a fascinating part of my life.  And--.
Speaker 1: I mean I've heard that before that Harold Washington would tell people that, don't, don't listen to people who say that they know what I want them to do or I said this or I want, you know, that.
Speaker 2: There were--Mayor Washington was so instrumental in getting blacks significant business in Chicago, black lawyers, black investment banking firms, blacks in corporations.  All of a sudden, he was part of changing Chicago and making Chicago much more diverse in terms of business.  He would say to major law firms and accounting firms, I see here that you're coming to me asking me if you can represent the City of Chicago, but you're all white males.  I don't see any women; I don't see an African Americans.  He created for Chicago diversity.  Even to this day now, that I think anybody doing business even with Mayor Daley, comes with a diverse slate of people.

Speaker 1: What happened next?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I ended up serving as, as chairman of McCormick Place [Chicago, Illinois] up until about the time when Mayor [Richard M.] Daley came on.  And, and when Mayor Daley became mayor, he appointed John Schmidt to become chairman of McCormick Place, and I rolled off that board.  But at the time--.
Speaker 1: John Schmidt became attorney general--.
Speaker 2: John Schmidt, ran for attorney general [of Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and just a sidebar, John Schmidt was one of the partners with Wayne Whalen that I worked for at Mayer, Brown and Platt [now Mayer, Brown, Rowe and Maw LLP].  In fact, John Schmidt was on the hiring committee.  So when I interviewed at Mayer, Brown and Platt, he was the first person that I interviewed.  He also left Mayer Brown to go over to Skadden [Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP].  So it's an interesting story, I mean he became the new chairman.  I left as chairman, but we became very good friends.  And actually his children, his child goes--went to the same school that our children went to.  So our wives got to know each other.  Our children know each other.  So it was fine.  I mean I was ready to come off the board.  What McCormick Place did for me is it gave me some exposure to go on--I mentioned before, when I came to Chicago, I came here, and one of the first people I met was the Reverend Ken [Kenneth] Smith, and, and what Ken Smith taught me was to, to be grounded in our community.  He taught me the importance of, of giving back to the community.  And so that was one of the reasons why I joined the board of the Chicago Urban League.  I eventually became the, the chairman of the Chicago Urban League for, for five years.  And it was a wonderful experience.  I still am on, on the board of the Urban League, but I, as chairman, I served as a member of the executive committee.  And, and then became much more involved in, in the civic community.  I joined the board of the United Way and I joined the board of the Chicago Children's Museum, and I now sit on the board of the Chicago Symphony [Orchestra].  And in many respects, I, I really got a chance to know Chicago and how Chicago operates.  I knew foundations and served on foundations that were responsible giving money to not-for-profit organizations that were committed to investing in the community.  So I really took a large part of, of caring for organizations that gave back to the black community on the West Side and the South Side of Chicago.  So as a lawyer, I joined the, the Cabrini-Green Legal Aid Clinic, and, and you may know Cabrini-Green was, is a huge, massive housing district that was housed with predominantly women that, that had children and gangs, low-income housing.  And, but many of those individuals had no other place to go.  And so many times, they would get in trouble and it would be un-unfounded trouble.  And, and so I served on the, on the legal aid clinic that represented them and tried to help them stay out of jail and to get good jobs.  So these were some of the things that I did that really sort of, I look back to, and I'd say, part of my life is really part of, of, of being part of the social, social service scene of Chicago.
Speaker 1: Did you work with Marion Stamps at Cabrini?
Speaker 2: I did work with Marion.  We didn't get to know each other well, but she wasn't (unclear) part--she wasn't with the Cabrini Legal Aid Clinic.  And that was the only part of Cabrini-Green that I, that I really stayed on.  And I actually stayed on that for about five years.
Story_ID: 20100
Speaker 1: After a while, you know, I--when I left the chairmanship of McCormick Place [Chicago, Illinois], I ended up just by--well, I'll tell you.  I ended up listening to Mayor [Harold] Washington as you can imagine.  I went out and hired a search firm to find a general manager.  I ended up listening to the late Governor [Richard] Ogilvie, who was the trustee, who said to me, "Trust me, there's no firm that I know of that's not political, other than Russell Reynolds [Associates].  So what I would recommend is, if you're going to go out, go with Russell Reynolds, and I'll introduce you to a partner at Russell Reynolds."  And back then, as, as the chairman of the board, I could hire a search firm if it were under a certain amount of money.  I did not have to go out for bid.  I think back then, it was thirty thousand dollars.  And I could hire Russell Reynolds for thirty thousand dollars, legally, without having to put it out for an RFP [request for proposals].  And, and so I hired Russell Reynolds directly.  I met him, hired him directly as the chairman, and, and when I left Skadden Arps [Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP] to go to Abraham and Sons [Capital, Inc.] and, and worked as an investment banker at Abraham and Sons and found a company that I wanted to buy, I went to Russell Reynolds.  And I said, "I have a company I'd like to buy, and I'd like you to help find me a chairman of that company, just the way that you represented me at McCormick Place and found a general manager."  Well, back then, the investment banking world was primarily funded through junk bonds.  And, and we were doing our financing through junk bond financing.  But junk bond financing pretty much went belly up.  Drexel Burnham [Lambert, Inc.] was part of that.  They went belly up.  And so, so my funding to buy this company sort of went away.  And Russell Reynolds said, what are you doing?  You, the market's going away.  Why don't you consider coming to us and, and working at Russell Reynolds?  Russell Reynolds had no blacks.  It was one of the largest firms in the world.  One of--the fourth largest firm in the world.  It's an elitist firm, made primarily of, of Harvard [University] and, and Yale [University], and the founder of the Chicago office went to Harvard.  Russell Reynolds himself came from Harvard and, and Yale.  I had no interest.  But then I began--I met people here, and it took about seven or eight months after meeting all of the major partners in the Chicago office.  They flew me to New York, and I met a number of people in New York.  And I joined, and, and I've been here ever since.  It's been fifteen years.
Speaker 2: Okay, so that was fifteen years ago [1990].  And, you're currently the CEO [chief executive officer] or--?
Speaker 1: Well, what happened was--I am the, the co-head of our CEO practice and our board practice.  What happened was, I was, I was hired into Russell Reynolds by a man named Chuck [Charles] Kepler.  Chuck ran the office.  In fact, the office that we're in, being--I'm being interviewed in by you right now was Chuck's office.  And he, he's retired now, but Chuck ran the office, served on the executive committee.  And he said, "I'm gonna be your mentor.  I'm gonna protect you.  I'm gonna give you the right assignments to work on.  I'm gonna make sure that you are successful here, if you come."  And so I came, knowing that he would be a mentor for me.  And he lived up to every part of his bargain.  I ended up working for a company called Motorola [Inc.], and at the time, the CEO of, of Motorola was, knew me from being the head of McCormick Place.  And so he and I met, and he asked me if I would help him find a board of director for Motorola.  He said, "We don't have any blacks, and I see you're black at Russell Reynolds, and I didn't know Russell Reynolds had any blacks."  And I said, "I'm, I'm the only one."  And he said, "Well, maybe you can help me find a director to come on our board.  And I'd like that director to be African American.  And it'll be the first African American we've ever had on the board of Motorola."  Well, this was a big deal.  It was a big deal for a firm like ours 'cause Motorola was a thirty billion dollar company.  It was a 'Fortune' 50 company, and, and so I represented them, and I found their first African American.  And at that point, the--there was a CEO of Amoco [Oil Corporation], before it was acquired by BP [British Petroleum p.l.c.] whose name was Larry [H. Laurance] Fuller.  And Larry said, "How did, how did you get"--the individual I put on was Sam  Scott.  He said, "How did you put Sam Scott on your board?"  And he said, "I used Charles Tribbett."  So Amoco hired me, and asked me if I would find the first black for their board.  So now, all of a sudden, Chicago is becoming more diverse, and I'm somehow being thrust in the middle of it at the executive level.  I put the first black on the board of Amoco.  And it turned out that the CEO of Amoco was on the board of Abbott Laboratories.  And the CEO of Abbott called me up and they said, "Listen, can you do what you did for Amoco and for Motorola to my board at Abbott Laboratories?"  And I, and that was Duane Burnham, who was the CEO of Abbott.  Duane and I became good friends, and I did a lot of work for Abbott, but I also put a, a couple of African Americans on, on that board.  So all of a sudden, here at Russell Reynolds, I became known as an individual that could find African Americans and put them in the highest jobs.  So after about five or six years, a number of things occurred at, at Russell Reynolds, and I became the co-head of this office.  And it's the third largest office for the firm and, and I co-headed it with a partner, and her name was Andrea Redmond.  I took over the responsibility of, of doing board work.  And after doing all of this board work for many, many years, it turned out that I got a chance to know boards of directors.  And as you may know, a CEO is hired and fired by a board.  And so any time that a CEO is fired or a CEO leaves, the board determines which search firm they will use to help them find the next CEO, if it's coming from the outside.  I happened to have been in the right place at the right time because having done so many board searches for all of the companies in Chicago, it allowed us to do the board work--the CEO search for United, United Airlines, for, for Bank One, and, and the rest became history.  We became the head of the CEO practice for this firm, and the head of the board practice, and now lead that practice, doing, doing some of the largest searches.  We are right now, today doing the largest search in, ever for, for this country.  And that's to find the next CEO of, of Hewlett-Packard [Company].
Story_ID: 20101
Speaker 1: You've got a book that comes out of this experience [as an executive recruiter at Russell Reynolds Associates], I guess.  You want to talk about the book?
Speaker 2: The book is a great book.  I, I--.
Speaker 1: I think you could hold it up if you'd like (laughter).
Speaker 2: You know, I, I--this book, 'Business Evolves, Leadership Endures',  I think it was, it was our decision that people need to know what we believe leadership is all about.  What are the traits that constitute leadership?  Andrea Redmond and I are unusual in the sense that our competitors are white males, but here at Russell Reynolds, a white woman and an African American male, we drive our CEO [chief executive officer] practice, and we are doing the largest CEO searches in the world.  And we felt that it was important to talk about what are some of the leadership traits that we look at that constitute great leaders and in CEO's.  And so we interviewed a significant number of people.  We interviewed Bill [William] Wrigley [Jr.] at Wrigley [Company].  We interviewed Bob [Robert L.] Johnson who founded BET [Black Entertainment Television].  We interviewed John Rogers [Jr.] at Ariel [Capital Management Corporation].  We interviewed the founder of Harley-Davidson [Motor Company], and we came up with a book that, is chaptered based on, on traits.  Some of those traits are listening skills.  To be a great leader, you have to be a great listener.  Another one is the, the ability to lead a, not a little life.  A CEO today must be able to not just run a company, but they must be passionate about it.  They must therefore, want to do something other than just be a CEO.  They want to give back.  They, they want to lead a, a life that matters.  Another thing in here is emotional intelligence.  And we think that today the CEO has to have emotional intelligence.  And so we believe some of these traits are enduring.  They're enduring qualities.  They, they, they stand the test of time.  They existed years ago, but many people didn't pick out those traits to constitute leadership, but they were there.  They are traits that you can find in teachers.  You don't find them just in CEO's.  You can find them in presidents.  You can, you can find them in, in academicians, in heads of not-for-profit companies.  We happen to focus in corporate American, and so we happen to, to look for leaders that have these traits in, in the corporate world.
Speaker 1: Now, what you've, say the term emotional intelligence, that's something that's kind emerged in the last few years.  People are talking about that as being the ability to deal with people or, or move through the world in a kind of smooth way rather than--you know, you could be real, you could be super intelligent around a subject, but you may not be--.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --able to deal with other people.
Speaker 2: Well, here's, here's what it is.  It's street savvy.  Emotional intelligence is that you don't have to be an A student.  You don't have to go to Harvard [University] to have emotional intelligence.  Emotional intelligence may be the individual that went to Harvard that has the C average.  Emotional intelligence may be the person that went to a, a junior school that's not in the top twenty for colleges, but they have a street savviness about themselves.  They have an instinct, an intuition, and, and they just know.  It--emotional intelligence is something that you develop, but you can't teach.  You know, you can't come into an office and, and let me help you get emotional intelligence.  You either have it or you don't have it.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, these are--this is a trait like a lot of traits that are very, that are in this book that people weren't--hadn't really codified until recently or hadn't really--they knew they wanted somebody with these, sort of, but they hadn't really written 'em down in this form, right?
Speaker 2: It's never been done before, and, and that's why we wanted to put it together in a book.  It's, it's our view of what constitutes a CEO.  It's our view of what significant traits are that constitute leadership traits.  It's, it's, it's what we have come up with after interviewing thousand and thousands of people over the last fifteen years.
Story_ID: 20102
Speaker 1: Okay, I think in recent past, if you were looking for a leader, you were looking for someone who had a high-profile name, right, or someone who was highly quotable?
Speaker 2: In the past, you would.  And in the past you'd look for the superstar.  You'd look for the individual who has done very well, is probably egotistical--so that I won't mention names.  But it's the individual that, that thinks of, of him or herself and mainly, it's himself because there're, there're not very many women.  And it's the individual that uses the I word.  Today, the leaders that we're looking at, these are leaders that will never use the I word.  They'll always talk about we.  These are leaders that, that, at an analyst meeting, they won't take credit.  They'll say that we're delighted that we have achieved these, these earning results because of the team that we have.  So they're much more interested in the people.  The new person, the leader will believe in diversity.  So therefore, this is an individual that will sit in a room, and, and when he or she wants ideas, they will look around the table, and they will want a diverse set of people that are helping to come up with those ideas.  In the past, that would never have been done.
Speaker 1: In the past, the diverse person would be the person who probably shouldn't say anything because they're not gonna be able to say it anyway (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, in the past, the diverse person was probably a functional person.  It was probably somebody that was in human resources or the general counsel, but not sitting around the table running a business, having a P and L as we would call it, profit and loss, having a P and L, driving the, the business and responsible for the earnings of the company.  Today, we look for those individuals that are diverse.  We look for those individuals and the leader is somebody who, who accepts their views.
Story_ID: 20103
Speaker 1: There's a list of leadership qualities basically in the book ['Business Evolves, Leadership Endures'], that the book is based around; vision, voice, heart, teambuilding, those kinds of things, you know.  What does it mean to have--what does--I think you avoided to voice just now, and how diversity, you know, lends itself to increasing the number of voices that actually feed into solving a problem.
Speaker 2: Well, it's not, it's not just, it's not diversity.  I mean the voice chapter is the chapter that focuses on Ronald Reagan, good example.  You know, it's the ability to captivate an audience.  It's the ability to say things and to have the, the tone of your voice in a way where you move and you show passion to a group.  And an individual that is able to capture that attention is falling in a category that we would look at.  And it's not one, it's not one trait or characteristic that constitutes leadership.  It, it's, it's adding all of them together that we believe puts you in the category where we can call you a leader.  And so, having backbone, the ability to have courage to, not just let individuals go, but to, to admit fault, to, to stand in front of the analysts to say, "I was wrong on that one" and move on.  So it's having, it's having backbone.  And it's also vision, you know, the ability to see around the corner.  It's, it's--you know, not only how to get there, but also know how to go around the corner and lead a group to take you there.  So it's putting all of them together that allows one to say, this individual, this individual really is a leader.  I look at Bob [Robert L.] Johnson at BET [Black Entertainment Television] when we interviewed Bob.  And, and, and Bob falls in one of those categories, to, to have vision, the ability to see around the corner and make great decisions.  He also fall, falls into the backbone category because he made some very tough and risky decisions that if they did not go well, he could have lost an awful lot of money.  But he spent a lot of his time and a lot of his trust in some--some mentors that actually, actually helped him and, and provided him with early success.  And, and so it's that.  And I, I concluded the book--Andrea [Redmond] and I concluded the book actually, with the title of diversity because that's gonna be that our--that's gonna be our next book because we will see in our lifetime a shift in our economy from, from where it is today to a greater recognition of diversity, diversity of thought, ethnic diversity.  Those will be important characteristics moving forward from 2005 to 2010.
Speaker 1: Okay, we hear people talk a lot about teambuilding in the, in these days, and, you know, the, and all the different kinds of individuals it takes to get something done.  They have Myers-Briggs [personality] tests now and a lot of--the other firms come up with tests to categorize people and to find out they fit within a system.  Well, and what are your thoughts on that?
Speaker 2: I think teambuilding is a characteristic that will determine whether or not you have a great leader moving forward.  And teambuilding in our book is, is the, is the ability to, to captivate an audience and to stand in front of that group and lead them, direct them, and at the same time, teambuilding means humility.  It means that when you're the CEO [chief executive officer] and you're sitting around sharing ideas and, and you have to make a decision, that, that you have the humility to listen to somebody else, and change your original thought because what somebody else said, makes more sense.  And so when they walk away, they actually feel that as a team they actually have contributed.  And that's a rare characteristic, and, and there are many people that are CEO's that listen to a lot of other people, and they just make up their own decision.  They say, thank you very much, but this is what I'm going to do.  But the, the new CEO is not gonna do that.  The new CEO is gonna grab a group of people together.  They're gonna form a team, and that team is going to actually make the decision.  So when I think of teambuilding, when you think of teambuilding in that book, think of humility.
Speaker 1: Okay, is there a process that you recommend for, you know, reaching decisions?
Speaker 2: A process for reaching decisions?  I don't think so.  I, I think--.
Speaker 1: When a group gets together to reach a decision, is there a process that's better than--is there any process that's better than another for reaching those decisions?
Speaker 2: I don't think there's a path that is the most successful path to reaching a decision.  I think, and what we talk about is the ability to have humility and listen to what other people are saying.  As the leader, you have to know when to stop and when to go.  You have to know when to finally make the decision, but you also need to know that, that everyone needs to have a voice, and the moment you recognize that the people around the table all have a voice and all have idea, and you recognize their ideas, then you can make the decision because they will recognize that you're making the decision based upon all of their thoughts and ideas.  It's only when you exclude them that you lose the team.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the onus of making a collective decision is on the leader in this scenario rather than--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --on a process by which everybody would, you know, contribute?
Speaker 2: Because there are a number of ways you can pull a team together.  You can walk around each individual, whether they're in their offices or in cubicles, and you can ask what their ideas are and then together--and then you can make your decision.  Part of this teambuilding and, and part of the process that you're referring to, it's, it's all about making people feel good, making people feel that they have added value in the end result.  They were part of your final decision.  I shared this thought, and Charles listened to that thought and he made his decision.  They feel good about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So you don't have to bring them around in an office.  You can walk, you know, walk the halls to get that view.
Story_ID: 20104
Speaker 1: We live in a world that seems to be increasingly diverse, even--I mean the president's administration has, you know, prominent African Americans in key positions, and what--and you say we're gonna see more of this.
Speaker 2: We have a long way to go in diversity.  I recognize the president has diversity [George W. Bush] in his administration, but we are far from being a diverse country.  The, in corporate America, diversity is, is at a very low percentage.  There is a low percentage of blacks on boards.  There are a low percentage of--I can count on, on almost one hand, slightly more than one hand, seven or eight people that are African Americans running publicly-traded companies of a billion or more in our, in our country.  That's ridiculous.  And when you look at the 'Fortune' 1000, there're one thousand CEO's running companies that--and how many are African Americans?  Very few.  And when you look at women, and when you look at women African Americans, it's even less.  I believe that this will change.  I believe it will change, and it will start to change on the consumer side because as McDonald's and as Burger King and as Coke [Coca-Cola Company] and as Pepsi [Pepsi-Co], as they begin to recognize that their consumer base is becoming much more African American, Hispanic, much more diverse, and that they need to begin to think now of how and what are the reasons why an individual that's a minority ought to buy their product, they will then begin to put minorities in certain major jobs.  A general manager that's a white male trying to sell a product in a Hispanic community will be a disaster.  So all of a sudden, that company's gonna have to recognize that they're going to need to train and groom a general manager that's a--that's a Hispanic to sell to a Hispanic market because they know it the best.  They know how to sell to an Hispanic, Hispanic market cause they grew up in that market; same for African Americans.  So I believe what will happen is we will begin to see this occurring on the consumer side or see it occurring on the finance side, and it will slowly develop on the industrial; not as much--not as fast, but I think between 2005 and 2010, we'll see a lot of changes in diversity on consumer and finance sides.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And the whole issue of, you know, recognizing an ethnic group as being a--well, in our case it's African American salesmen being better able to sell in African--to the African American community seems to have like--oh, I'm trying to form a question around that, but I've recently talked to a man in Philadelphia who developed a strategy for selling Hennessy Cognac in the black community, which is something that a lot of people in the community, once they looked at the strategy--it works, but it's not what the community wanted.  So I mean I, you know, it's a double-edged sword in some ways.
Speaker 2: Well, it may be, but if you're referring to the failures that could occur by putting a minority in the job and trying to sell that product, that can happen, but it's--the, the risk is greater by putting an individual in that job that has no clue about that culture.
Speaker 1: No, that's not what I really mean.  I mean the sales of Hennessy shot way up and it's primarily due to the African American community.  But the problem, people in the community though, wanted to change the values of that community--.
Speaker 2: Oh, I see, I see, with alcohol.
Speaker 1: --had problems with the--for instance like BET [Black Entertainment Television], for example, I mean putting a lot of music videos on air, you know, to get a lot of black viewership.  But is this really what the black community really needs, I mean, to grow and develop?  And there's been a lot of criticism--.
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: --of the product, you know.  It could--it reached, you know, black households almost twenty-four hours a day, you know, but, you know, there's criticism of the product too.
Speaker 2: I see.  That could be, but, but even going beyond that.  Look at, look L'Oreal, L'Oreal acquired Soft Sheen Carson, an African American health [sic, hair] care company, and now, all of a sudden, L'Oreal knows how to, to sell a product to African Americans because they have a president who is African American that's actually selling products on, for L'Oreal, to that community. I mean, it's not hurting the community.  It's actually helping them because they, they want to use the ingredients that, that came out of Soft Sheen.  But they now can use the research and development from L'Oreal that's a international company.
Speaker 1: Okay, there are a lot of different, you know, different sides to all this, I guess, but it doesn't hurt to have--in fact, it's better to have more black people involved in the decision-making process than not.
Speaker 2: I agree, yeah.

And so my goal is to continue to drive the, the leadership at the top in doing CEO [chief executive officer] assignments and board assignments for America's 'Fortune' 100, 'Fortune' 500 companies.  It's, it's rare.  There's not another African American today that is doing searches for the CEO of any company that's five, ten billion or more.  And I think it's important to stay there, and I, and right now, I just got there.  And so the trick is to do great work, and great work leads to more work, and, and continue to capture the markets.  And the market share that I have, we have at our firm and, and my partner [Andrea Redmond] and I have, is, is not that great.  So the future is--and we're young, so the future is, leaves a lot for us.  And, and so I don't think that I will change that.  I think I'll continue to do it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you are in a unique position, you know, when one realizes what you actually do and who you come into contact with.  And it is a, it's a pivotal position, I mean it's really a unique position.  How do you approach it?  How do you approach a search for a company?  Is it mostly through--I know being African American, it gives you like an edge in finding African Americans, but if you had to find, say, Koreans or some other--Hispanics, now, how would you, how do you approach it?
Speaker 2: Well, the searches that we do, that I'm doing at the CEO level, they're not targeted searches.  I think that--and our client is the board, and the boards, they're paying us to find the best person that can run their company.  And they tell us what the, what they believe the job description ought to be, what the qualifications of the individual should be, and our goal is to go out and find him.  So we spend a lot of time interviewing, and it doesn't matter whether you're black or white, we, we will interview you and determine whether or not you fall within the kind of qualifications and have the cultural fit to lead a particular organization.  Now, there are, there are assignments that, that I do that are driven on the diversity side.  I'm looking for the next CEO for the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  Eight years ago, I recruited Kweisi Mfume to, to become president of the NAACP.  When he stepped down, that board hired me to find their next leader.  That next leader will more than likely be African American.  So for me, it's going around looking at all of the major leaders today that are across industries, from corporate to academia, to foundation to, to, to politics, to find out which ones do, do we believe ought to be the top candidates for the, for the board of the NAACP, the interview and, and hire.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, and now, how did you--can you maybe walk us through the process of finding Kweisi Mfume for NAACP.
Speaker 2: The NAACP was a great search.  And it was one of the most fascinating for me.  It was back in nineteen--it was back seven years ago; 2005, so back up seven years ago, and the late Leon Higginbotham was, was my client.  I think Julian Bond was not the chairman of the board then.  Merlie Evers, I think, was the chairman of the board.  And, and my job was to find--and at the time, the NAACP was going through major turmoil.  It, it was losing money.  It had--it fired its, its CEO--.
Speaker 1: That's right after Ben [Benjamin] Chavis.
Speaker 2: It's right after Ben Chavis.
Speaker 1: They had a big scandal around the misuse of money, and--.
Speaker 2: Misuse, improprieties that had occurred.  So the NAACP was, was, was--its credibility was in jeopardy.  The mission was to go out and find somebody that could enhance that credibility and that could drive the NAACP back to profitability.  So we went all across the nation talking with every individual you could possibly think of that was a black leader, male or female.  And I remember talking to Earl Graves at 'Black Enterprise'.  I think, there was not anyone I really didn't talk to that wasn't a significant leader.  And many times getting idea from them; sometimes asking them if they would want the job.  We ended up, I ended up approaching Kweisi, and it wasn't an easy sell.  I, I actually had help from Leon Higginbotham, and I think Kweisi will tell you that Leon is a, is a wonderful man, and before he passed away, I learned a awful lot from him.  And, and when I think Kweisi was selected by the executive committee, it was Leon Higginbotham that presented him to the entire board of the NAACP and shared with the board why Kweisi was the right person.  And just to hear him talk and the passion that he had and the personal nature that he, he talked to that, that board, really convinced the board that I understand now.  Let's move forward; let's hire him.  And he was hired.  And I think he did a great job for the NAACP.  As, as always, leaders should not be in their job forever.  And so after eight or nine years, it was time for Kweisi to volunteer to move on.  He volunteered to, to go to his next, next job, which I don't know what that will be; maybe a run for governor.  I, I hear a lot of different things, but it's now also time for the NAACP to find another leader.
Speaker 1: That's what I've heard, is he's going to run for office in Maryland, I think, but he, you know--so, are you involved in the search for the new--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the new, the new one, is yes.  You know, my client is Julian Bond and Benjamin Hooks is on the board of the committee, along with Jack Kemp and, and others, a great search committee.  And, and they are my clients, and so, as we speak, I, I am looking for their next CEO.

Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well, my, my hope is that the African community not be radical, but not be patient, that this is a time where, I think, we have to be more forceful in the, of the opportunities that are ahead of us.  I think if we, we sit around, I think we, we miss out on opportunities in corporate America.  I think there is a, there's a desire on the part of corporate America to, to create diversity because of the need of our nation becoming diverse.  And, and so this is a time in which we must be bold and we must not be afraid to say that we're African American.  We must not be afraid to, to say no, and so my, you know, my--I have, I have high hopes for African American, the African American community, not just in corporate America, but in academia, in--on the foundation side.  I believe that we now are in position--we now have the capability to drive any of those markets, from foundations--and we have individuals that are leading some of the foundations in the country, some of at the largest corporations in the country.  And we have tenured professors at some of the largest and most prestigious universities.  And I think now is the time to continue to accelerate that.

Speaker 1: When you look back at everything you've done thus far, and you're still fairly young in this community here, what would--is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: No, it's, it's a great question.  I've often thought about that, but I, I think everything that I have done is what has led me to where I am today.  I enjoyed being a lawyer.  I think that my legal skills in coming from a great law firm is what helped to get me the job that I'm in today.  I think many times where I talk with boards, and they recognize that I'm a lawyer, they recognize that I'm, I'm sharing with them not just a consultative view, but also probably a legal view, even though I'm not their lawyer.  So I'm, I'm delighted that I went to law school, and I look back at my experience at Marquette [University].  It taught me a lot, and, and I think that my study habits there helped me to become a great student at [University of] Virginia [School of Law], but it also helped me get into a great law school.  So I look at each stage, and it's all been, it's all been very--it wasn't planned, but if I hadn't left Skadden Arps [Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP] and gone to a small firm, Abraham and Sons [Capital, Inc.], which really didn't work out, I would never have ended up at Russell Reynolds [Associates].  So I'm happy I went to that, that part of it, and ended up at Russell Reynolds.  I think that people are successful also through making mistakes and, and through learning and accepting the fact that, that not everything is gonna be perfect.  So my life was not perfect.  You know, I made mistakes.  I probably shouldn't have left Skadden and gone to, to start up a company which didn't work, but I'm happy I did because through that mistake, I ended up coming to Russell Reynolds.

Speaker 1: Now, what have been the highlights of your career until this point, and what would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, I think, you know, when I look back now, you know, I look at what I'm doing today.  You know, I've been at a firm [Russell Reynolds Associates] for the last fifteen years, and I've been at a firm where in, in my business I'm the only African American doing what I'm doing at this level.  The highlight for me, is right now, doing the largest search in the world by a--and no one else has done it, and let alone being African American.  I wasn't hired because I was African American, but I'm doing it with another partner, and I don't think you can get much bigger unless you, you know, unless the, the CEO [chief executive officer] of the number one company.  But right now, we're doing a CEO search for an eighty billion dollar company, and, and that's truly for me, you know, it's an honor to do it, but it's also a highlight for me.  When I look back on a lot of things, and, you know, one thing that I haven't talked about is my family.  And, you know, we have three children.  I have, have a wife [Lisa Tribbett], and everything that I've done, all the decisions that I've made have gone back to my wife.  You know, there's always, you know, who was your best mentor?  My best mentor happens to be my wife, you know.  She's the one that I share everything with, and, and so the, her advice to me is really what's led me where I am today.  She was the one that I talked to coming to Russell Reynolds about, and, and if it wasn't for her support, I probably wouldn't have come.  I would have probably stayed as a lawyer.  And so, you know, we're, we, we tried to raise a very close family so we, we spent all of our time together.  We talk to our children every day.  And so I think, you know, I'm most proud of the success I've had on the business side, but I'm even more proud of, of our family.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your parents are still--well, your father passed--?
Speaker 2: My father [Charles Tribbett, Jr.] passed away, and he passed away when my wife and I married, a week after we married.  My mother [Dorris Morris] is still alive.  My wife's father [Howard Morris] passed away, and her mother is still alive.  So our two mothers are both living right near us in, in Chicago.

Speaker 1: The last question we have is similar to legacy--is there anything else we should talk about before we ask the last question?
Speaker 2: I, I don't think so.  We've covered a lot.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, it's something to think about.  Now, I didn't know what you did, you know, not really until after I got in this chair.  I started really thinking about what you really do (laughter).  I'm not--.
Speaker 2: You know, no one knows really about executive search.  It's, it's a, we, we are in a, a business that only an elite group knows about.  The kind of work we do and just to talk with us, you'd have to earn a base compensation of at least two hundred thousand dollars, plus a bonus, plus stock.  That's just sort of the entry-level positions that we work on.  So when you think about it, for the most part, the big four to five firms, you're talking mainly to white individuals.  There's not a large group of Hispanics or, or Koreans or Chinese or African Americans that are earning that.  There are, they are there, but not a lot.  The bulk are white males and some white females.  So our group is, I mean we--I'm in a very elitist group.  But I'm proud of being here because by being here, I have, I believe I've helped bring African Americans into this, into this world.  And they're--into, into this space that I'm in.  And there are a number of my friends now, that now know about Russell Reynolds [Associates] and our competitors and are now excited about it and want to get into this business, which I think they should, 'cause I think this business grew as a white-oriented business, like individuals, like my founder, Russell Reynolds, who went to his, his friend to say, let me work for you.  And he was white, and he said, who do you want--you know, I'll find somebody for you.  And who does he find?  He finds friends that he knows that are all white.  So they, it just grew, and we grew to become a large white, organization.  And we placed individuals that were predominantly white into corporations.  It was until minorities like myself and some others in, in our industry--and there are others, there are other partners at other large firms now, it's only then when we began to help to diversify this market.
Speaker 1: Well, it's a position and, it's--does it ever make you feel sort of, that people really don't understand what you're--I mean--well, you know they don't.  I mean a lot of people really don't know what you're doing.
Speaker 2: No, they don't.  But I think it's not a secret.  I mean I, I tell everyone what I do and how I do it, and it's, it's not always easy to, to get into a search firm and talk to them because our, our clients are, are really the ones that are paying us, and it's not the candidate.  But it's important for us to know every individual that is looking for a job because they become our candidates.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, anything else before we get to this last question?
Speaker 2: No, go right ahead.
Speaker 1: Because I'm glad I raised that because it just seems--a lot of people have jobs where they feel that if other people only knew what they were doing, but that nobody--.
Speaker 2: I know.
Speaker 1: --that people really don't.
Speaker 2: Well, I'll tell you one, one story--the, the beauty that I think that I have enjoyed the most is being able to talk to individuals about the numerous options that they can have in their career.  I do this a lot with my children, you know.  I, I--and I tell my children, you know, when I grew up, I thought of being a lawyer, and I thought of being a doctor.  I never thought about other things, but I can tell you now that you can, you can be a microbiologist.  You can be a, an applied mathematics guru and work at a, at a law firm or you could work at a corporation.  You can be an electrical engineer.  You can go into Wall Street, and if you go into Wall Street, you don't have to be a commercial banker.  You can be a derivatives expert, you can be a number, a whole host of things.  So, if there's anything that I've learned from Russell Reynolds, it's all the different options that you have, not only just at corporations and financial institutions, but even as an entrepreneur.

Speaker 1: Well, the last question is similar to legacy, but how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I would like to be remembered more for what I do, and with my family than I would from what I do with, with my job.  I think I've accomplished a lot.  I'm very proud of it, and I still think there's many things I need--I would love to do in continuing to accelerate in my business.  But I think that, I think what I'd like people to remember is, is the family that we raised, the three children that we have and, and what they do in this world.  And, you know, we try to, to let them recognize that it's important to give back.  We try to let them recognize the importance that they are African Americans, and they should not forget that.  And, and we try to let them know that a lot of our lives is spent in volunteerism, and a lot of the volunteerism that we do is for African American organizations like the Chicago Urban League, like doing the search for the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], like serving on a foundation that's responsible for giving money to organizations on the South  Side and the West Side.  And, we, we want them to, to know that if you are successful in what you do, make sure that you give.  And I think, I think if, if our children do that, and you're sitting here, you know, twenty years from now talking to my children, I'd rather be remembered by that than being remembered or doing a, a large search.
