Story_ID: 658322
Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna ask about your family history. I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side. But we'll start with your mother's side.
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Bernice Swan-Edwards, B-E-R-N-I-C-E, S-W-A-N dash E-D-W-A-R-D-S.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My mom was born in--that's bad.  You're gonna be cutting this, right?
Speaker 1: No, no, no.  Just give us what you--generally--I mean was she born in Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My mother was born in Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was born in '55 [1955], and she was thirty years old when she had me.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, what--can you remember the town associated, 'cause you, you gave me several places--
Speaker 2: Right, I gave you--
Speaker 1: --before we started.
Speaker 2: A lot of my family came from Yazoo [Yazoo City, Mississippi], Denton [Mississippi].  I would say primarily that's it, and Belzoni [Mississippi], definitely Belzoni.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's where my father [Claude Edwards] was born.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, how far back can you trace them, her, your, your mother's side of the family, and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: I can go back on my mother's side of the family to the 1800s.  And they were farmers; they were sharecroppers.  With my--staying with my mom, yeah.  And so that's--pretty much they--I can trace it back to slavery.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, are there any stories about the end of slavery or what people did after it I mean?
Speaker 2: Not too many stories about what they did, but I remember having a tape that my grandmother [Sallie Swan] had recorded.  And she talked about her grand- her mother being Creek, Creek Indian [Native American].  And you know, they were just hard workers.  They were definitely into the church, definitely entrepreneurs. Church was a big part of my family on both sides.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, but there are no stories about the end of slavery or what, what happened (unclear)--
Speaker 2: No stories, not on my mom's side, no.
Speaker 1: All right, okay, all right, and so they, they--were there any landowners on your mother's side?  Basically, they, they were sharecropping?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now did--what did your mother's parents--were they, they sharecroppers too I mean?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My mother's parents, no, my mother's parents, particularly, they were not sharecroppers.  My grandfather [Wash Swan], I can't, I don't go too far back as far as what his occupation was, but they had like eleven and twelve kids.  My grandmother was definitely a, a housekeeper.  She--you know, at that time eleven, twelve kids, your job is raising your family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, now, did your mother talk about growing up and how she, she grew up and the stories?  Did she give any stories from childhood?
Speaker 2: My mother, primarily being one of the oldest child's, her responsibility was to take care of her sisters and brothers, and that's what she talked about far as just taking care of her sisters and brothers.  She, she had aspirations to do more.  She wanted to be a seamstress.  So ultimately that's something she did do as far as making clothes.  But she also wanted to be a teacher for a while, so she taught in school for a little while.  But her true dream was to be an entrepreneur, was to--and ultimately that's what she did and very successfully so.  So when they moved to Milwaukee [Wisconsin] my mother, she owned a salon.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: And one of the--
Speaker 1: A salon, a bea-
Speaker 2: Yeah, hair salon.
Speaker 1: --beauty salon.
Speaker 2: Yeah, beauty salon, one of the few salons in Milwaukee.  And I remember with my mom, she became one of the first women, woman to really actually do weaves, back in the day, used to have a pole.  And there's not too many people who could use a pole and weave that weft into your hair.  And she was known for that, and so that was her specialty.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, now, did she go to high school here in Milwaukee?
Speaker 2: My mother did not attend high school here in Milwaukee.  She attended high school in Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: So when she came--by the time she came to Milwaukee, she was in her, I would say mid-twenties.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did--did she tell you the name of her school at all?
Speaker 2: No.
Story_ID: 658323
Speaker 1: Let me go to your father's side.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Claude Edwards, C-L-A-U-D-E, E-D-W-A-R-D-S.
Speaker 1: All right.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My father was born in Belzoni [Mississippi].  And (makes sound), I should have this answer.  But he was born obviously I would say--I'm gonna be lost here, but he is actually thirty--he was--I was born when he was thirty-one.  I mean, yeah, when he was thirty-one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was born in 1955.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Can I have my cheat notes, all the stuff I wrote down (laughter)?
Speaker 1: No, 1914, could that have been it?
Speaker 2: It's right in, it's right in your, in your notes.
Speaker 1: Any rate, but--
Speaker 2: He won't be (unclear) right (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, so your--now, once again, how far back can you trace your dad's side?
Speaker 2: I can trace my dad's side back to 1832.  And his, his grandparents were slaves.  So we can go back as far as that.  And ultimately, when they were freed, they became--they were not sharecroppers.  What they did was they purchased the land, and they had people pretty much rent the land from them.  So that's, I think that whole entrepreneurship came from both sides of my family, saying that's--you know, let's take some ownership.  Let's look at other opportunities versus just being a farmer and farming for someone else.  Let's see how we can, you know, grow this.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he, he, okay, he was born in 1921 (laughter) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: You sure?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think so, yeah.  He was thirty-four when you were born, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, he was thirty-one.
Speaker 1: Thirty-one?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, 1924.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yes (unclear) right, yeah, you know.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, '24 [1924].  At any rate, so, so your dad, did, did he have a, a chance to go to school in Belzoni?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my dad did go to school.  And I'm, I'm not sure of the school that he attended.  But ultimately he, when he was--he went into the [U.S.] Army--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at a young age.  And the interesting story about my daddy going to the Army is that he refused to, to carry a gun.  He refused to shoot anyone because of his faith.  So they actually gave him a stick.  And he was stationed over in Germany.  And that's what he would carry, was his stick during the drills, but he never carried a gun, never shot anyone.
Speaker 1: Now usually they make people medics and that sort of thing if they're, they're conscientious objectors in terms of--what religion did he have that he--
Speaker 2: Church of God in Christ, Pentecostal, straight.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Church of God in Christ is my, my both sides of the family.  That's how they met, through the church.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so, so I don't understand the stick thing.  I don't think that they would send him into a war situation with just a stick.
Speaker 2: Oh no, I don't think they sent him to the war.  I'm sure they kept him on the sideline with the stick.  But he refused to carry a stick [sic.], and he stood strong--
Speaker 1: A gun.
Speaker 2: --to his conviction of not carrying a gun.  He said it was against his faith.  So I don't know how he was able to manage it, but it worked for him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's his story.  He said, "I refused to carry a gun.  They gave me a stick."
Speaker 1: So did he serve on the stateside during the war [World War II, WWII], or did he go overseas?
Speaker 2: He went to Germany.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was actually in Germany.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's where my sister really got her nickname.  He, he--there was a lady there called Gleeter [ph.], and he named my sister Ivory Gleeter Edwards [Ivory Edwards Adkins].  So we tease her about that today, like, your name came from Germany.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did he have any stories about the war he shared with you?
Speaker 2: Not really.  You know, he really did not talk about the war.  His main story was that stick.
Speaker 1: Of course, he served in a segregated Army.
Speaker 2: Of course.
Speaker 1: And so, all right, so he (unclear) any of stories he shared with you that--
Speaker 2: No.  He really did not talk about the, the Army.  And the thing is, is that I'm the youngest of, out of six kids, so I'm sure my brothers and sisters, they have stories.  But by the time they got to me it was like, no more stories; it was a whole different day.  But the only story my daddy would repeat was--I don't want to say it for the fifth time, but it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He carried the--
Speaker 2: --the stick.
Speaker 1: That's a strange, yeah, a strange story.
Story_ID: 658324
Speaker 1: So did your parents meet before the war [World War II, WWII] or, I mean, or, or after the war?
Speaker 2: They met after the war.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did they meet in Milwaukee [Wisconsin] or--
Speaker 2: No.  They met in--
Speaker 1: --Mississippi.
Speaker 2: --Belzoni [Mississippi].  They met in Mississippi.  They were going to the same church, in that same area.  They were both grounded in the Church of God in Christ, and so they met in the church.
Speaker 1: Okay, what was the name of the church?  Do you know?
Speaker 2: I don't know the name of the church.  That I don't recall.  I know Rehoboth [Rehoboth Miracle Temple Church of God in Christ] is a big church, a longstanding church here in Milwaukee, so I would not be surprised if that name was inherited.  But I don't know the name of the church.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, and how soon after they got married did they move to Milwaukee?
Speaker 2: Probably, back in the day, they probably moved to Milwaukee about a, a year after they were married.  I remember my daddy [Claude Edwards] saying that he had moved to Milwaukee first.  And he called my mom [Bernice Swan-Edwards] and said, "Take the first thing, the first train running."  So she met him here after he was here for, for about a year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what year were they married?
Speaker 2: They were married--I'm going to be guessing again, Larry [Larry Crowe].  I, I truly would be.  But they were obviously married before my oldest brother [James Edwards (ph.)].
Speaker 1: Okay, so that would be--when was your oldest brother born?
Speaker 2: We're all kind of like two and one year apart.  So my oldest brother--god, Larry, can I have my cheat sheet?  You can't stop this video and let me get my get my cheat sheet?
Speaker 1: Well, you were born in '55 [1955], then--
Speaker 2: I was born in '55 [1955].
Speaker 1: How, how many older--
Speaker 2: And so it was--
Speaker 1: --siblings do you have?
Speaker 2: --I was--I have five sisters and brothers, five siblings.  And, and the girls are two years apart; the boys are one year apart.
Speaker 1: Okay, so some--around 1946 or so--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --I guess.  I'm, I'm just guessing.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So they--okay.  Then shortly thereafter they moved to Milwaukee, so that would be in the late '40s [1940s], I guess early '50s [1950s] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --they moved to Milwaukee.
Story_ID: 658325
Speaker 1: Now, when you think about your parents' personalities, their dispositions, their--what they looked like, their sense of humor, how they walk, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I, I take after both of them.  And I remember my mom [Bernice Swan-Edwards] saying to me one time that, "I told your dad [Claude Edwards] you take after him, as far as his disposition."  My daddy is kind of headstrong.  I think that's probably where I got the little headstrong personality.  I love the fact that they were both entrepreneurs, so I, I took that, that spirit of you can make it on your own from both of them.  I took my style--I took all of how to host from my mom.  She was, I would say when it came to entertaining people she was a very classy lady.  And I like to--I thank God for that, you know, because I can run across people, and you like, "Well, what's going on there?"  Then you may meet their mother, and you say, "Oh, okay," you understand where they got their style or what, or all those things from.  So I really take after both of my parents.
Story_ID: 658326
Speaker 1: Now tell us about your brothers and sisters.  Can you name them from the oldest to the youngest and in order?  And, and tell us a little bit about each one.
Speaker 2: Okay, my oldest brother was James.  His name was James Alvin Edwards [James Edwards (ph.)].  He primarily lived with my grandmother.  He would come to town and visit.  And he was the life of the party.  He passed away at the age nineteen in a car accident.  So I think, so I was like ten or so when he had passed away.  But I always remember James coming to town, and my other two brothers were so excited.  They were like, "We have a big brother."  And he was in a band.  And I remember--I'll never forget this, when he brought his band members to the house, and my mother [Bernice Swan-Edwards] laid pallets out on the floor for them.  And we were like, we looked at them as being stars.  I remember my brother, my oldest brother James, showing my younger brothers, his younger brothers, how to shoot a gun.  So when my parents were not there, they would take the gun and shoot into a chute, a clothes chute, which was crazy.  I'm glad no one was hurt or the bullet didn't go through the wall.  But he was the life of the party.  And I remember him saying that because my parents worked.  I remember my hair kind of being all over my head, and my brother--we were on the front step--and my brother said, "You know, if I could comb hair, I would comb Penelope's [HistoryMaker Penelope Stewart] hair."
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) And I remember.  To me that was so much love.  I was like, "Boy, my hair must be really looking bad for my brother to say he would comb my hair," (laughter).  So that was my oldest brother, James.  Like I said, he pa- he, he was transferring cars from Milwaukee [Wisconsin] to Chicago [Illinois].  I think he was working for Avis [Avis Rent A Car System].  But they would just drive cars from one place.  It was definitely a rental car.  And you know, young guys, they were speeding, and he was trying to be the, in the lead.  And he was a leader in his group.  He was extremely handsome.  All the girls liked him, which made us very popular in the neighborhood, because the girls were like, like you because they like your brother.  And they were speeding.  And obviously that wasn't a seatbelt time.  And, and for some reason he lost control of the car, and it flipped over several times, and obviously he was thrown out of the car, and he passed away.  And so I remember that because I remember when my parents went to the hospital and they came back.  And I can just only think about, you know, I was a young child.  I was like, "Mom, I'm hungry."  We were over at my auntie's house.  And they were like, "Your brother has passed."  And I was like, "Mom, I'm hungry."  It didn't weigh in that my brother had actually passed.  But he was so full of life.  He lived his life to the fullest in those small--in that short timeframe of nineteen years.  And--
Speaker 1: When did he pass away?
Speaker 2: Obviously I am not a date person--
Speaker 1: Now, how, how old--
Speaker 2: --but I was around ten.
Speaker 1: --were you when--
Speaker 2: He was nineteen when, when he passed away.
Speaker 1: Okay, 1965 (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was; it was in the early '60s [1960s].  As a matter of fact, it was the same year my grandfather passed away, in 1965.  You're correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My second oldest brother was Claude, I think Claude, Jr. [Claude Edwards], named after my dad [Claude Edwards].  I think he and I take after each other the most out of all of my siblings.  He was very, he was very into his books, so to speak.  And he, he served in the [U.S.] Army for a while.  Then he trained to be an accountant, so he took care of a lot of our business as it related to the books for my daddy's church [Faith Temple Church of God in Christ, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  Also, when I became an entreneur- entrepreneur and had our own shop, he took, he also took care of our accounting.  The interesting thing about Claude was that it's ironic because he was always into the books.  And I graduated college first in my family, and he would--he really wanted to graduate, be the first one to graduate 'cause he wanted to be the big brother.  But it's a story about that, because actually when I thought I graduated I didn't actually graduate [from Mount Mary College; Mount Mary University, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  I had to do one more class.  So I never told him that officially (laughter) I had not graduated, 'cause he--it, it would have been a contest.  But with Claude, he suffered a stroke at the age of about twenty-six.  He was very, like I said, always a person about his business, you know, not into the street side.  He was moving his family to a house, and he had suffered a stroke.  And it kind of, it, it really--I think there's a, obviously a change.  But he had--he was able to still walk.  He did have some paralysis on one side.  He had a, you know, he couldn't walk straight.  He had a, suffered some, some in that area.  But he, he, too, after that he was the life of the party.  The one thing about the stroke is that it kind of changed his disposition as it related to, he looked at life differently.
Story_ID: 658327
Speaker 1: Did he have full use of his limbs and everything and--
Speaker 2: Yes, he had full use (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) could he talk or did he have any paralysis or--
Speaker 2: No, he didn't have paralysis in the face.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He had it in his arm, and he had a limp.  But he could still--I mean, I could be driving down the street, seeing this person walking five miles or whatever, I'm like that's my brother.  He didn't let that slow him down.  So, but with Claude [Claude Edwards], yeah, we looked up to him because he was the smart one; he was the, the smart one.  And so that's what I remember about Claude.  I also remember that Claude just loved to, he enjoyed eating.  He enjoyed life.  And I remember about a--I would say he ultimately had another stroke and a seizure, and that was maybe about ten--about, I would probably say twenty years later, 'cause he was in his, he was like fifty-six when he passed away, and he had the stroke when he was twenty-six.  And I remember I would have parties at the hou- at the house with the family.  I'm like, I'm gonna have a family dinner, be like soul food, you know, have a once a month family dinner.  And towards the end of his life, I was like, "Really, Claude, you can't bring a meal?  You can't bring sodas?  You can't bring anything to add to the party?"  And he was like, "Whatever."  And I remember about a month before he had his last stroke, I remember something said, "You know what?  Don't ask your brother to bring anything.  As a matter of fact, when he comes, you're gonna make him a plate, and you're gonna serve him.  And whatever he wants to eat, just let him eat, and don't even bother him about that."  And I was so happy that a month before he really had that major stroke, which he never recovered from, that God spoke I guess and said, "You know, enjoy your brother, serve him."  So that was my brother, Claude.  He also had our first nieces and nephews, so that was cool.  My next brother was Bobby [Bobby Edwards (ph.)].  Now he was the prankster.  He would like--Bobby--and I remember one time talked about they didn't do wrong.  They did steal a car one time, and my mother [Bernice Swan-Edwards] went to court and said, "My kids don't have to steal a car.  I have a car.  I, I bought them a car."  And they were like, all right and cool.  But years later, maybe about twenty years later, they confessed.  They said they did steal that car (laughter), just for the--
Speaker 1: And she didn't know it at the time.
Speaker 2: --heck of it.  Right, just for the heck of it.  But with Bobby, the story I remember most about Bobby, he loved--with me being the baby, they would always tease me and just, you know, make jokes of the baby.  They would also always send me to ask my daddy [Claude Edwards] to buy a pizza or take us to the ice cream, 'cause my daddy would like, "For my baby, Sweet Child, I'm a do."  And then when my daddy would say, "No, get out of my room, go away," I would walk out of my daddy's bedroom crying, and they would tease me.  And I never would, I never quite got that, why I would go into that, my dad's bedroom, and say, "Daddy, can we order a pizza?"  He would say yes or no, but I still walked in that room.  Or when we left church [Faith Temple Church of God in Christ, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], I, I would be like this, "Dad, can we stop and get ice cream?"  And if he said yes, I was the hero.  If he said no, I would get my feelings hurt and cry, and then my sisters and brothers would tease me.  But with Bobby, he would hide behind every door, every corner and wait for me.  As soon as I would come out--I mean walk through the hallway of the house, he would go, "Boo," and literally scare the heck out of me.  And he did this for about a good month.  He would just wait for me to walk around the corner and hide and go, "Boo!"  And so I told my mom.  I'm like, "Mom, I can't take this anymore," (laughter).  I said, "Bobby is--I'm be a nervous wreck."  And I'm all about ten years old.  And my mom said, "You can take this broom, and the next time he jump behind the door, you wop him as hard as you can."  So I took the broom, sat in the living room, 'cause I knew he was coming.  I was just waiting for him.  And he came, and he said, "Boo!"  I said wop (gesture) (laughter).  I hit him so hard he laid on the floor for about five minutes.  And I was like, "You're not dead; get up," (laughter). "You're not dead."  And he got up, but that was it.  He never played that prank on me ever again.  So that's my brother Bobby.  He's always, and still to this day, he's the jokester.  He likes to talk in the Mick- that little Donald Duck character.  He loves to--so he's always been the jokester.  I don't--that's because he was the youngest of the three boys.  But that was him.  He's always trying to make a joke and make someone laugh.
Speaker 1: What does he do for a living now?
Speaker 2: He's a barber.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He's a barber, so they kind of took the trade after my, my father.
Story_ID: 658328
Speaker 1: My next sibling is my sister, Donna [Donna Edwards Ciepluck].  My sisters taught me to be strong.  They were like--you know, Donna always, she too like to entertain.  She liked to--I remember she, she wa- she was a singer.  And she would travel to Los Angeles [California] and perform.  And she would come back, and she was the first person who told us about guacamole.  And we were like, "We're not eating that green stuff," (laughter). You know, or you know, she liked to tell jokes.  She was, liked to be the life of the party.  We always considered her like, the beautiful one, 'cause she was just so gorgeous.  So, Donna ultimately, which I was so proud because, my dad [Claude Edwards] used to always take us by the lake and say one day you guys can live in one of these mansions, and ultimately, Donna did.  And--
Speaker 2: Did, did she sing under the name of Donna Swan?
Speaker 1: Donna Ciepluck [Donna Edwards Ciepluck].  She, she married.  Her, her married--her, her name was Donna Ciepluck.  She never went by Ciepluck I don't think.  I do have a--
Speaker 2: How do you spell that (unclear)--
Speaker 1: C-I-E-P-L-U-C-K.
Speaker 2: Okay, Ciepluck, okay.
Speaker 1: Ciepluck.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: And so she ultimately, she made her, she made her own, a record.  I mean she has a CD [compact disc].  And so I admired her style.  I admire, I admire her--what is--her just saying, "I'm gonna reach the stars." So I admired, admired that about her.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And then comes you.  You're, you, you're the baby (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Then come Ivory [Ivory Edwards Adkins].
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, okay, all right.
Speaker 1: And so Ivory (clears throat), excuse me, Ivory was like my second mom, the first time I had a second mom, because my parents were entrepreneurs.  They were working all the time or in the church [Faith Temple Church of God in Christ, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], 'cause my dad was also a preacher.  So Ivory was the one that was responsible for taking care of me.
Speaker 2: She's only like two years older than you, right?
Speaker 1: She's two years older than me.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Right.  And back in the day, two years was like a big difference.  Now it's like, hm.  And so she really had ownership of me, you know, really as far as it related to making sure the baby was taken care of.  She, too, is a, she's a cosmetologist.  She owned her own business.  And she's also now--I'm so proud of her--she's a life coach.
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And so with Ivory, I just always remember her taking care of me, that I was her baby sister.  And then, voila, there's Penelope [HistoryMaker Penelope Stewart].

Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you grow up in the same neighborhood here in Milwaukee [Wisconsin], or did you--yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in Milwaukee, we grew up on 7th [Street] and Galena [Street].  I'm on 18th Street, which is--7th and Galena was not far from here.  What happened is my parents [Bernice Swan-Edwards and Claude Edwards] owned the home.  They had the highway.  They were--they ultimately tore down all the homes.  The government purchased the homes from the people who lived there, forced them to move.  But they never, they didn't build the highway until ten years later, which was unfortunate 'cause they broke up a whole black neighborhood.  And so, then we moved--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've heard about that.  People have discussed it.  [HistoryMaker] Reuben Harpole was talking about it and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --[HistoryMaker] Marvin Pratt was talking about--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --how the highway basically severed the neighborhood.
Speaker 2: It did, it did, even when--I think it probably had an impact on Walnut Street, which I'm right off of Walnut.
Speaker 1: But Walnut was the main drag in the--
Speaker 2: Main drag.
Speaker 1: --in the Bronzeville [Milwaukee, Wisconsin] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, the doctors would hang out, everybody, the professionals.  People would come out of town and go to Walnut Street.  So, so my parents purchased a home on 14th [Street] and Keefe [Avenue].  And at the time they purchased the home, I was around four.  When they purchased the home, it was probably exclusively a white neighborhood.  I would say within six months, it was a black neighborhood, talk about serious white flight.  We end up having one Caucasian neighbor that was right next to us, and they didn't move.  I don't know if it was because of their financial situation.  So I was, definitely grew up in the time where I know what white flight is.  I was like, "Wow, this used to be an all-white neighborhood.  Now it's all black."
Story_ID: 658330
Speaker 1: All right, so we were talking about the neighborhood.  What, what did--was there a name for this?  I know it's the North Side of Milwaukee [Wisconsin], right? But it's--
Speaker 2: Yes.  We lived on the North Side.  Really, I didn't realize that people considered--I guess my family was upper middle class.  I really didn't realize that we were privileged until people who didn't live--who really lived on Galena [Street] and the area I live in now saying, "Ooh, you live in the white, live in the white folk's neighborhood."  At (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 'Cause there was like a white flight you said as you, you all moved in.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now was this a former Jewish neighborhood or--
Speaker 2: No.  Milwaukee does have a lot of German, Germans.  There's a lot of people from German--Germany, in Milwaukee.  So, but it was like, never seen anything like that before, that literally we were there, and the six months houses went for sale, and other black people purchased the homes, which was fine to me.  I really didn't understand until I was older that, what was going on.
Speaker 1: So this is at 14th [Street] and Keefe [Avenue], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, on 14th and Keefe.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then it's Keefe, and then there's a couple of other streets up, and then there's Capitol Drive.  Capitol Drive is where the black doctors live.  So we were like, maybe six blocks going south of where the doctors live.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it was considered, in the black community, it's a middle class neighborhood.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 658331
Speaker 1: All right, so, can you--do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I do.  I remember, I think I can remember back to three or two.  I remember walking up the steps with my--going to the attic with my mom, and I remember seeing all the toys there.  And I was like, "Wow, this is like heaven."  But someone also shared with me that my mother had a miscarriage and when we were going up there, and I don't remember that.  I remember playing in the, a yard when I was like three and, and four, 'cause I didn't move to 14th Street [Milwaukee, Wisconsin] 'til I was four.  I remember on 7th [Street] and Galena [Street] running in the yard with my sisters and brother.  I also remembered that my sisters and brothers were going to go visit my Uncle Monroe [Stewart's maternal uncle, Monroe Swan].  And they didn't want me to tag along with them, so they--so, so I'm like, "I'm going, I'm going."  They're like, "No, you stay home, Penny [HistoryMaker Penelope Stewart]; you stay home, Penny."  And I remember, and I definitely was about three or four.  And I decided I was gonna follow them anyway.  And so what they did is they took--and they say me behind them.  They took off running.  But I decided I was gonna try to catch up with them.  And before I knew it, I was lost, probably was, probably three blocks from my house or two blocks.  And I remember this guy asking me if I was an Edwards.  And I know this is a crazy story.  And I said, "Yeah," so he slapped me.  And I remember I started (laughter) crying.  And the neighbors heard me cry.  They came out.  And I was, "Dang, that was crazy, like, dude slapped me."  And I don't know if it was some jealousy going on.  I don't know.  Like I said, I'm the youngest of six kids.  And I remember the police bringing me home.  I remember watching the squirrels jump from house to house.  And they gave me a ice cream, and I was sitting and eating my ice cream.  I was happy.  And I remember when I got home, obviously my family was ecstatic that I was safe.  And I was looking at my sisters and brothers like, good, hope y'all get a real good spanking.  And so I remember that.  I remember when I was about four.  We moved to 14th Street, 'cause I wasn't going to school at that particular time.  I remember just--I don't know.  This is a crazy story.  I remember standing in the middle of a sidewalk like this and challenging people to walk past me, you know, like I'm not gonna move (laughter).  As I think about that now, I was like, that was crazy and mean (laughter).  So yeah, so I remember, I remember when I was about six or seven.  This would be my earliest job.  I used to collect bottles.  I was the bottle queen.
Speaker 1: Yeah, those were the days when you could redeem pop bottles for--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --a nickel.
Speaker 2: Two cent--
Speaker 1: Two cent.
Speaker 2: --and a nickel.  So I would walk up and down the alley and collect all bottles.  And I would go to the, the corner store down the street and get penny candy for days.  And I remember, I recall--like I said, I was about six years old--and I got so bad that the neighbors knew I collected bottles, and they would send me to the store, said, "I will give you a bottle if you--will give you the bottle if you go to the store."  And then my sister and brothers, they were like this: "Penny, go to the store, and you, you can have the, the soda bottle, soda bottle."  And I remember I got so bad that I would just sit there and watch my sisters and brothers, watch them sip the soda and wait for the bottle to be emptied.  And my sister, my older sister, Donna [Donna Edwards Ciepluck], would just go like this, "Stop that."  She would like this, "Go away; I'm, I'm, I'm gonna take my time."  And then she started spitting gum into the bottle, 'cause she knew I couldn't take the bottle back with the gum in it.  And then my--
Speaker 1: They wouldn't take the bottle with gum?
Speaker 2: You have to get--no, you can take the gum out.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And then my brothers, ugh, they used to pee in their bottles, 'cause they used to be in the basement.  And I would go like, "Gross, but I'm gonna," (laughter), "rinse this bottle out."  And so, I was called the bottle queen, to the point that the Star magazine [Milwaukee Star], which does not exist now, they did a feature on the corner grocery store, 'cause this is when African Americans owned the stores and things of that nature.  And the people, the Warrens [ph.], they were being interviewed about being entrepreneurs, owners.  And they had me--and they said, "Oh, here's our bottle queen."  They said, "We were just talking about you, Penelope."  I came with all my bottles to redeem them for my candy.  And they put me on a crate, a milk crate, over the, the soda container, which back in that day, you know, pull it up (laughter).  And I remember I had a wool dress on in the middle of summer.  Like I said, my parents [Bernice Swan-Edwards and Claude Edwards] were working.  And I had a ponytail, looking half crazy.  Now I see why my brother [James Edwards (ph.)] wanted to comb my hair.  And they took a picture of me.  And my mom saw that picture in the magazine, she was just livid.  She was like, she, like, she wanted to sue them, like, "How dare you put my daughter--?" And I was like, okay, I was in a winter dress with a ponytail in the middle of winter [sic.], but--I wish I could find that picture.  So I was known as the bottle queen.
Speaker 1: Well, that's interesting.  So how old were you when that, when you, when the picture (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) About six.
Speaker 1: About six?
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: Huh. Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 658332
Speaker 1: So now, you started school at Keefe Avenue School [Milwaukee, Wisconsin], right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that was right down the street I guess, right from where it was.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was about four blocks.  We were on 14th [Street] and Keefe [Avenue].  Keefe was like 17th Street, so it was walking distance.  And then I remember, if you look historically, they started busing kids.  The school became too crowded.  So instead of building--another school in the neighborhood, they bused us out, and they bused us to a school called 35th Street.  And I couldn't understand it at that time that we were kept separated from the kids at 35th Street.  35th was all-white school.  And so we were in a separate class.  We couldn't have lunch with the white kids.  We had to bring paper bag lunches, and we had to sit at a separate table.  And we couldn't play with the white kids.  And I never quite understood that until I got older.  That's what, you know, segregation--that's what--that this is, both our, MPS, Milwaukee Public Schools--I just, and I, I really hated that because it took the community away.  When we were at Keefe Avenue, we could sit with everyone and walk to school and you know, walk back home together.  And going to 35th Street was a wakeup lesson in what segregation really was about at that time.
Speaker 1: It, it, it took away your social contact--
Speaker 2: It did--
Speaker 1: --your--
Speaker 2: --totally.
Speaker 1: --friendships and I guess.
Speaker 2: And not only that, but it, it made you feel like a second class citizen.  You were like, "Why can't we sit with the white kids?  Why can't we play with the white kids?"
Speaker 1: Did your parents [Bernice Swan-Edwards and Claude Edwards] know any of that?
Speaker 2: I think they knew, but I think it was like something that was acceptable.  You know, as far as our parents, I don't think they were really like--and I don't know as a child how much I may have shared with them what was going on.  And maybe it was normal to me at that particular time.  So, I, I definitely remember that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's interesting, so.  Yeah, that--okay.  So this is--and how old were you when you went there, 35th Street School [Milwaukee, Wisconsin]?
Speaker 2: I was probably about eight.
Speaker 1: About third grade?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, third grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now what were you interested in in school, I mean, despite these kind of problems?  Were you interested in any of the subjects at school?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, at third--in that, I was probably interested in socializing, because I didn't realize I need glasses and couldn't see.  So--
Speaker 1: So did that, that like hurt you in schools in terms of your grades?
Speaker 2: It did, it did.  It, it was like they would--my teachers would say, "Penelope's [HistoryMaker Penelope Stewart] a sweet student, and we love her.  She's a--her attitude is good, but she talk too much."  And I realize I, I didn't get glasses until I was in the seventh grade [at Parkman Junior High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  And It's almost like you don't know you can't see until you get those glasses, and you realize.  And I was like, wow, I sure did miss a lot.
Speaker 1: Now did you think that you were slow or something yourself (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: I mean did you have any doubts about your own--
Speaker 2: No.  I couldn't say--which my, my, my sisters and brothers would tease about--I couldn't say three.  I would say tree.  They say, "Penelope, count to five."  "One, two, tree, four, five."  And they would just crack up.  So I think there was some areas I think definitely not seeing not missing out on those formative years of that educational process because I couldn't see the blackboard, that I really just kind of made my world around me and talked to my neighbors and stuff, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I've heard these kind of stories before, people cannot see in school.  They don't know ever where they--so they miss a lot.
Speaker 2: You--I, I definitely--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --think you miss a lot.
Speaker 1: You miss a lot and especially in terms of reading 'cause you can't see the letters.
Speaker 2: Right.  You can't see the blackboard.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: And then, you know, you start having teachers say, "Why are you squinching?"  And that's when it was brought to my parents' attention that she's squinching.  And it was like, "Oh, Penelope can't see."
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, now did you--did that change your focus in school, I mean, like--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  It was like I was really--got my glasses when I was seventh grade.  I remember they have teacher days--teacher, student day, where the teachers pick a student to teach their class.  And I remember the algebra, algebra.  The, the teacher, he selected me to teach the math class, and I was just totally surprised.  And it was like a compliment.  It was like you're smart, Penelope, you know, kind of patting yourself on the back because you received so many bad grades, but now that you can see--so that was a turning point in trying and believing in myself, that he selected me to teach that class, because that was a class everyone is like, "Oh, you don't want algebra; that's hard."  I was like, "No, it's not.  It's not hard."
Story_ID: 658333
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the black population in Milwaukee [Wisconsin], from what I read, started really growing in the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And it got to a certain point, and then people started losing jobs.  But--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So in '66 [1966], now you went to Parkman Junior High School [Milwaukee, Wisconsin], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Parkman was a, Larry [Larry Crowe], was a brand new high--junior high school.  And I remember Mr. Douglas [Andrew Douglas] was the principal.  He reminds me of the principals you see on these TVs that no, take no stuff principal, but had a heart.  And we knew Mr. Douglas didn't take any stuff.  But he was a thin, tall, dark skinned guy.  And, but he had a lot of love, but he didn't take any stuff.  There was nothing gonna go down in that, in that junior high school.  But it was good to go to a brand new, new, new junior high school, 'cause when I entered into seventh grade, we were the first seventh graders to go to that school.
Speaker 1: So, so was, was it mostly a black school or--
Speaker 2: It was all black.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: So Keefe Avenue [Keefe Avenue School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] was all black.  Then they built Parkman, probably built it 'cause they didn't want to send us out to the suburbs or to the white neighborhood.
Speaker 1: 35th [35th Street School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] was white and--
Speaker 2: 35th was white, correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, and you got your glasses in the seventh grade.  Is this when you started junior high school?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So a new school, new glasses, brand new (laughter).
Speaker 2: New attitude (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right, well, that's good.  So, now, well it sounds like a good experience from the beginning, but were you drawn to any particular subject matter and--
Speaker 2: I would say math.  Math, it is I was always interested in math.  You know, junior high school, it's about finding yourself.  It's about being into the social clubs.  It was about joining the choir.  It was about the sock hop during lunchtime.  It was about the movie 'Birds' came out, and we could go see 'The Birds' during lunch hour.  You could see fifteen minutes, and then you'd come back the next day and see the ra- the other fifteen minutes.  And you know that 'Bird' movie, that just, that was the first horror movie (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Alfred Hitchcock, right?
Speaker 2: --made you look at birds. I look--you look at birds different even today because of that movie.  But the sock hop was fun.  So, junior high school was about socialization.  It was about just enjoying being young, being on the drill team, yeah.
Story_ID: 658334
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, now, you went to Washington High School [Washington High School of Information Technology, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  Now was that a, a neighborhood school, or did you have to be--
Speaker 2: No (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) bussed to that?
Speaker 2: No.  The weirdest story about Washington, and, and I'm, I'm really amazed today at why I decided to go to Washington, because Rufus King [Rufus King High School; Rufus King International High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] was the--Parkman [Parkman Junior High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] was the feeder school for Rufus King.  Everyone in the neighborhood attended Rufus King.  I told my dad [Claude Edwards] I didn't want to go to Rufus King because I knew everyone, and I would end up talking and not studying.  And I wanted to focus on my studies, so I enrolled in Washington.  Thank god two of my friends followed me.  Washington was a predominantly white school.  It was the white flight six months after I was there.  All the white kids left.  And primarily, I mean, you had, you did have some agitators coming in.  You had guys that didn't go to the high school come and just beat the white kids up on the bus.  So I cannot blame their parents for taking them out the school.   But it was the same thing, that it was all, all-white school.  I really wanted to focus on my studies, which I say to myself now, "Wow, you were kind of focused early."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then, after being in Wash- after attending Washington for about three months, I begged my daddy to send me to Rufus King, because if you don't know people you get beat up.  You know, it was like, all the kids--I didn't realize the feeder group that went to Washington was, came from the bad school.  They came from--the were--they, like they didn't come from my middle school.  They, they came from the bad school area.  That was the feeder group that went into Washington.
Speaker 1: So these, these are black student.  So they were like, pretty tough, huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so you had to have a tribe, so to speak, not to get beat up.  And so my dad said, "No, you made a decision to go to Washington.  I'm not gonna move you to Rufus King.  You're gonna have to live by your decision." Which I was really a little salty about him for a while.  But ultimately, I never, never got beat--I never, no one ever jumped me or anything, 'cause I kind of learned how to play both fields, how to hang out with the bad girls and how to hang out with the good girls and still get my work done.
Story_ID: 658335
Speaker 1: Okay, now the neighborhood that Washington [Washington High School; Washington High School of Information Technology] is in is called Sherman Park [Milwaukee, Wisconsin].
Speaker 2: Yes, Sherman Park (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, and, and the school has a history--I, I guess it was a very strong Jewish community at one time, 'cause you have all these in grade--Newton Minow, Bud Selig, who was commissioner of--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Major League Baseball.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Newton Minow was a, with I think CBS or something in those days, Abner Mikva, NPR's [National Public Radio] Michael Feldman--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --came out of that school.  So, the--who was at school with you in those days?
Speaker 2: Only person I can think--I cannot--because I didn't grow up with--I was only at Washington for about two years--
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: --because I graduated a year early.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: So I really didn't--like I said, the kids that came from Washington came from--I can't remember the school offhand.  But I know Mark Sain, who became one of the first assistant fire chief, attended Washington.  I remember the thing about Washington was that they're a Purgolders.  And when we would go to games against teams like Rufus King [Rufus King High School; Rufus King International High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] or Riverside [Riverside University High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], they were Tigers, the Panthers, and people used to tease the Washington students.
Speaker 1: They, they were the what, the--
Speaker 2: Purgolders.
Speaker 1: Pur--
Speaker 2: Purple and gold put together (laughter).
Speaker 1: Purple golders, oh.
Speaker 2: Purgolders.
Speaker 1: Purgolders.
Speaker 2: We were like, "What's a Purgolder?"  And I was like, "What is a Purgolder?  Is there an animal called Purgolders?"  And someone said, "No, it's purple and gold put together."  So the kids from the black schools would tease the kids from Washington, saying, "You guys aren't anything.  You, you're not even an animal.  You're a Purgolder.  You're two colors put together."  And I was like, "Uh, wish I was a Panther.  I wish I was a Tiger.  Why I gotta be a Purgolder?"
Speaker 1: Wow.  Were the teams very good at Washington?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.  I remember the cheerleaders were--well, it was slightly embarrassing because, again, my first, my first year there, even though they had white flight, the cheerleaders were predominantly white.  And I remember they would do these cheers like: "Shake your head, ba, da, da, da."  And you know, black schools were like (demonstrates).
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: I was like, I am just so embarrassed (laughter), just so embarrassed.  So I don't know how good our teams were.  I was there for two years, and I was like, "Oh, thank you, God."
Speaker 1: I think later, af- years after you left, Latrell Sprewell was there, you know--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --big time basketball player, but.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 658336
Speaker 1: But, okay.  But you were only there two years.  Now did--what were you drawn to at Washington [Washington High School; Washington High School of Information Technology, Milwaukee, Wisconsin]?  Any--or--or, and--and were there any special teachers or mentors?
Speaker 2: I don't remember special teachers.  I remember the hall aides were predominantly African American.  And I just, I, and I can't recall the one lady's name, but I just remember how nice they were, you know, how they, they treated us with respect.  So it wasn't a particular teacher in high school that I was really drawn towards.  It was really, high school was a year of kind of finding yourself, going from like that child to adulthood, you know, trying to smoke cigarettes for the first time and hang out in the bathroom and 'til you realize hanging out in the bathroom is not a good thing.  You're not gonna graduate.
Speaker 1: So you came out in two years.  Now were you in the business course?
Speaker 2: So what happened is that, the story is that I just happened to have taken enough classes, and I became pregnant in my, in the eleventh grade, in '73 [1973].  And it's funny, 'cause as I talk about the cheerleaders, I tried out for the cheerleaders.  And I was gonna be--I was selected to be a cheerleader, but when I found out I was pregnant, I was like, "Oh no, that dream is gone."  And then I said, "Thank god I went to summer school, and I was able to have enough credits to graduate in '73 [1973] versus, versus '74 [1974]."  And it's kind of interesting because I was held back a year in third grade, and it probably was the glasses.  And, but I still ended up catching up--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --after the glasses.  And I remember hanging out in the bathroom with, like I said, some of the bad girls, because me and my little, my partner who lived in my neighborhood and decided to follow me--and, but we knew when to go to classes.  What I liked about the--I shouldn't call them the bad girls, but they were like, they would write fake hall passes and take them to your class and say, "The principal wants to see Penelope [HistoryMaker Penelope Stewart]."  And they would say, "Come on, girl, let's go in the bathroom and smoke cigarettes."  And, but I, I knew a difference between when I had to go to class.  And it's interesting that when I was graduated, I remember telling my girls, "I, I gotta go," and I informed them that I was graduating.  And they became very salty.  They were like (gesture) 'cause they were like, behind.  And I was like, "Hm, no. I wasn't just sitting in this bathroom smoking cigarettes all the time.  I was doing my homework and getting my grades done."  So it was good that I had enough credits to graduate, because when I graduated I was like three months pregnant.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, now the, the fellow that you--that was the father was--did he stay in your life?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was--I was just sharing--he kept flunking--flunking.  Like, you know, I'm in eleventh grade, and you're still in like ninth or tenth.  Back in the day, it's embarrassing to say you're dating a ninth grader, and you're in tenth or eleventh grade.  So he was a beautiful person, very sweet spirit.  His family was wonderful.  They're, they're a second family.  So that's what happened there.
Story_ID: 658337
Speaker 1: Okay, now, your, I know your family is very involved in the Church of God in Christ, right?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: So what did, what happened when your parents found out?  Were they--I mean, how, how did the Church of God in Christ handle it--I mean the one--what was the name of your parents' church?
Speaker 2: Faith Temple Church of God in Christ [Milwaukee, Wisconsin].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, how did they handle this news?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, my parents were divorced at that time, and my father [Claude Edwards] had custody.  And my father, great dad, but because he was a barber and owned it, and was a founder of his church, was kind of never around.  That's kind of why you got pregnant, because--
Speaker 1: This is, okay, so this is interesting 'cause very seldom does a father get custody of his--
Speaker 2: Very.  It was--
Speaker 1: So what, what, did your mother [Bernice Swan-Edwards] have a serious issue or something, or--
Speaker 2: No, not at all.  I just think that my mother was like, after raising all of her sisters and brothers, being the oldest, and after having six kids, I think my mother just wanted to have a life.  You know, she found herself.  She was an extremely successful businesswoman, as far as owning a salon.  You know, she had the, you know, brand new car every year.  I think my mom wanted to find herself.  I think after raising her sister and brothers and, and raising, having six kids, she was just finished.  And obviously, you know, pastors have a reputation too.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause your father was a pastor as well as a barber, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Those are two--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --sources of income primarily as barber (unclear) income right?
Speaker 2: Probably the beauty shop.  I think both.
Speaker 1: Beauty shop, okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause back in the day, it was when the guys--when that pimp scene popped up, and the guys were coming in there to the shops every day to get their hair done, every day.  And I think my mom's shop was where all the pimps would come.  She wasn't the primary hairdressers for the pimp, 'cause I remember being in the shop pregnant looking at all these pimps and looking at their women walk in and go--
Speaker 1: So these are, okay, so these are real pimps.  These are not just guys that--
Speaker 2: No.  These are--
Speaker 1: --are dressing like pimps.
Speaker 2: --straight pimps--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I mean, the original pimps.  I think they was the first pimps in Milwaukee [Wisconsin].  And they would have the girls come in, bring them money.  They would sit there every day, get their hair done, every day.  And it just amazed me.  And they were, they were cool.  I mean, they were like, "Hey, Penny [HistoryMaker Penelope Stewart]."  I was just sitting there watching them, and I was pregnant--
Speaker 1: So this is--
Speaker 2: --at the time.
Speaker 1: --nineteen seventy-three [1973], just for--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the sake of giving a flavor to this.  Those are the years when the black pimp style was platform shoes--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --wide bellbottoms--
Speaker 2: Long coats.
Speaker 1: --big hats like--
Speaker 2: Big hats.
Speaker 1: --'Super Fly' and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --like the blaxploitation movies that you would see.
Speaker 2: 'Cause they would go out--at night and hang out with the girls.  And then they, they had perms and would get their hairs, the hair rodded or straightened.  So, they had the money--
Speaker 1: So was your, was your mother's beauty shop one of the top ones in the city?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And my--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and the barbershop.  I mean--my father's barbershop--
Speaker 1: Were they in the same, were they in the same location?
Speaker 2: No.  They were in different locations, but they both had the same name, Ace Beauty Shop [ph.], Ace Barbershop [ph.].
Speaker 1: Ace, okay.
Speaker 2: And we're talking about top class that you walk in there, this is not a hole in the wall beauty shop and barbershop.  This is all brand new, modern furniture.  And it's called--it was that if you wanted to go to the barbershop, there was two, Handsome's [Handsome Barber Shop, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] and Ace Barbershop.  And as it relates to beauty shops, there was one other beauty shop, but my mom would be one of the top shops.  But I want to go back, Larry [Larry Crowe].  My father, even though he was from the Church of God in Christ, he was a little bit more liberal than a lot of the ministers in the Church of God in Christ.  Like, back in the day, you couldn't wear earrings, makeup.  He didn't really have a problem with us wearing earrings, too young for makeup.  But you couldn't go to the movies, but he let us go to the, the movies.  There used to be a theater called the Egyptian [Egyptian Theater, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], and we would go to the Egyptian.  My daddy didn't have those hang ups.  Like, you know, he wasn't really strict, as related to--and I, I really appreciated him for that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think the concept--correct, correct, correct me if I'm wrong that the people in the church have a, the concept of being saved--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --where you're not.  I--you're saved you don't go--you don't listen to music; you don't do--there's so many things you can't do, you're not supposed to be able to do--
Speaker 2: Right.  Church of God in--
Speaker 1: --that are of the world and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Church of God in Christ is kind, used to back in the day considered one of the strictest churches, as related to saved, sanctified, full with the Holy Ghost; can't wear long skirts; you can't wear pants; can't wear jewelry; can't wear makeup; gotta be covered up.  They would put a napkin over your lap if your skirt was too short, maybe send you out if you didn't have the right clothes on.  So, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's a black denomination.
Speaker 2: Yes, it's a black denomination.  And then back in the day, you know, I really didn't realize people looked down on people from the Church of God in Christ, because you know, it was like, you know, kind of the upscale would go Baptist, and then the really up, upscales may go Catholic and not--I'm sure they were raised in that environment.  But Church of God in Christ had the Holy Ghost dance.  People weren't trying to do Holy Ghost dance because that's too black.  So they was trying to--you know, so if you were in Church of God in Christ it was kind of looked down at.  I think the Church of God in Christ may be the closest as far as the connection with the African culture.
Story_ID: 658338
Speaker 1: Now the only thing my dad [Claude Edwards] was strict about was we had to go to church every Sunday.  We could not spend the night when people had pajama parties on Saturdays we couldn't go because we had to go to church.  So we were the choir, the congregation.  We were the schoolteachers for bible school.
Speaker 2: Was it a very large church?
Speaker 1: You know what?  My--what I, I've learned is that it was a midsized church, but it was renowned for people will come to town and say, "You gotta go to Faith Temple Church of God in Christ [Milwaukee, Wisconsin] 'cause they really have the spirit."
Speaker 2: So did you have like a, a band basically--
Speaker 1: They didn't have--no, they had an organist.
Speaker 2: Some of the Sanctified churches that I've seen had like a, a band (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well not--back then it was starting with the organ, then a piano, then they branched off to having the drums.  But back in the day it was just primarily the organ and the pianist.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And my daddy played the guitar. It would def- be my dad on that guitar going--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --(imitates guitar).
Speaker 2: I know some churches it wouldn't be you know permissible to play guitar--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --it, I mean, it wouldn't, wouldn't go against necessarily a rule--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --you wouldn't see it at an A.M.E. church [African Methodist Episcopal], somebody playing the guitar (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, you're right about that.  My daddy played the guitar.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But some Baptist--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --Sanctified church.
Speaker 1: So that was the only thing.  And I think because he made us go to church every Sunday, when I became eighteen I kind of rebelled and said I'm not going to church every Sunday.
Speaker 2: So, okay.  Did, did you have an official role up until that point in church, to teach or to do something?
Speaker 1: Choir (laughter), bible school teacher, you name it, whatever role needed to be, whatever role, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: Definitely the choir.
Story_ID: 658339
Speaker 1: So, when your baby was born you were like, were you seventeen? Or--
Speaker 2: I was seventeen.  I was two weeks away from my eighteenth birthday.  My daughter [Tamara Stewart] was born November 24, 1973.  I graduated in May of seventy--June of '73 [1973].
Speaker 1: Okay, now you're seventeen years old.  Now did you have--considering what you do today, did you have good prenatal instructions?  And did people talk about--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: They tell you how to--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --take care of a baby?
Speaker 2: No.  And we talked about that earlier I think when, how the--my family take that.  With my mother [Bernice Swan-Edwards], we didn't live with my mother.  My dad [Claude Edwards]--and I was just, what help was that my sister [Ivory Edwards Adkins] had a, had a--
Speaker 1: The oldest (unclear)--
Speaker 2: --my older sister, who--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --took care of me had a, had a son.  So it was like, wasn't a shock factor.  I just had to go and say, "By the way, I'm pregnant," and I'm sure he was hurt by it.  But--
Speaker 1: Did, did your sister have her--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I mean while she was a teenager as--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, so it wasn't if you were the first one to ever do that.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we just had too much free time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean, with parents, one part divorced and one working and going to church all the time, we just ran the streets, which is a bad place to be as a young person.
Speaker 1: So your baby was born without any complications or anything or--
Speaker 2: No, no complications.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No complications, but when you talk about prenatal information, none of that kind of existed back then.  Matter of fact, what's popular back then was welfare.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You, if you had a baby you were gonna get welfare.
Speaker 1: So you must have gotten some instructions from somebody about how to take care of the baby, right?  Didn't you?
Speaker 2: Probably when--it's, it's one of those things, Larry [Larry Crowe], that you learn by living it.  You know, you don't really know what you don't know.  You know, it's like, it's totally different now.  Like now they have these prenatal care coordinators that you can go to walk you through.  Pretty much, you know, you have a doctor that you're not really familiar with.  You go to a clinic, and they just usher you in like another person, like a cattle call, so to speak.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well I'd say more impersonal, right?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --than, I know when your mother probably grew up, and I can almost guarantee that there're women who were midwives--
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: --in the community--
Speaker 2: --I agree.
Speaker 1: --that, that could sit down with her and tell her, you know, and people had a lot, lot, lot of children in, in Mississippi and down south and places--
Speaker 2: A lot of children.
Speaker 1: --like that.  They did farm work, and plus there was no reason not to have them 'cause you need more--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --people.  So, yeah, so she probably had more, maybe more instruction than you what it seemed like--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --I mean.
Speaker 2: So having, my sister having a child made it easier.  And she tried to tell me, she said, "You don't need a baby," but you know, you're like this. Now I'm gonna have this baby.  So having my sister two years older than me, she was really the one who helped me through the whole process.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Did your mother give you any advice at all?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Hm, that--that's unusual, yeah.
Story_ID: 658340
Speaker 1: Well, okay, so, so now you got a baby [Tamara Stewart]. And I know you need--so what are you think- thinking now in terms of career, or, or, or what are you gonna do?  What, what do you see for yourself in the future, 'cause the young man was not somebody you were gonna marry, right?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: So you know, I wanted to be an, I wanted to be a fashion designer for some reason.  I was like stuck on being a fashion designer.  And I remember my aunt Agnes [Agnes Swan] who was like a mentor, like a second mom, 'cause I would babysit for her all the time.  And so I really was blessed to have her in my life.  So my auntie was by the house, and she said, "So, what you gonna, what are you gonna do now?"  And I said, "I'm gonna go to MATC and study sewing and stuff."  She said, "Why don't you think about going to University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee [Milwaukee, Wisconsin]?"  And I said, "Oh, didn't think about that."  So she was--she had attended the University of Wisconsin, and she got the application for me and, and everything.  And, and I remember they sent it back, and they declined, they reject my application because they said I only had two years of English versus three years.  Now you know I graduated two years, in the two years versus three years.  And she marched me to that office.  I mean, we went--she went to UWM, and she said, "How dare they deny you, talking about three years of English.  If you were smart enough to graduate in two years."  So we, we--she took a trip to UWM with me and went to the counselor and really lit, just ripped them, so to speak.  And sure enough, they let me in.  And that changed the course of my life.  That's why I think it's so important for us to be mentors to our young ladies, because if it was not for her I would not have attended a college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She said you want her--they said, "Go to MATC.  Get one more year of English.  Then come back."  She said that's what I think--my auntie said, "I bet you that's what you do to all the black students that come here, tell them to go to MATC, 'cause you know they're gonna get deterred and end up staying at MATC and not coming here."  She said, "How dare you deny her that."
Speaker 1: Now Milwaukee Area Technical College [Milwaukee, Wisconsin] is MA- MATC, is a--they, they offer associate's degree, right?
Speaker 2: Right, Milwaukee Area Technical College.  Back in the day, it was MATC.  Back in the day, people used to make jokes, "You so dumb; you gonna graduate from MATC." You a--and now it's totally different.  Graduating from MATC, you make be- may make more than someone who has a degree.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right, so it's no joke now.  But back in the day, so that kind--that changed my whole course, and so I attended UWM for about two years.  And I decided I still wanted to be a fashion designer, so I decided I was gonna go to Mount Mary College [Mount Mary University, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].
Story_ID: 658341
Speaker 1: Now what is--was Mount Mary [Mount Mary College; Mount Mary University, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] famous for--I mean did it have a reputation for fashion design?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, very well, renowned.  As a matter of fact, they have some designers that are in New York [New York] right now.  They were known as the fashion school in the Midwest.  They would have an annual fashion show [CREO].  And I remember the person that interviewed me, and she was another mentor in my life.  Her name was Sister Heloise [ph.].  And it was like, it was then that your grades aren't high enough to get into Mount Mary.  So I wrote a letter, and I said my grades aren't har- high enough because I'm raising a child [Tamara Stewart].  I'm also working.  You know what I mean?  I just did not have time to focus on my studies 'cause I'm doing all of this, but I need to be here; I need to be at this school.  And they accepted me.  So she--well, they interviewed me.  And it was interesting because I couldn't figure out what to wear that day.  And Larry [Larry Crowe], it was like ninety degrees outside, no air condition, and my hair kept swelling--sweating back.  And so I ended up getting to the interview with the counselor about an hour late.  And I did call.  And I remember she said--I've never had anyone talk to me like this.  She said, "Let me tell you something."  She said, "You will not get any place.  You will not be successful.  I know you called, but that's unacceptable.  And if you're gonna come to this school, that behavior is unacceptable."  And I was like, dang.  And she became really the person, my go to person, if I had--if I thought school was too hard, she would say take less courses.  And, and what really I liked about her is because after the first year, I, I didn't get into the fashion design because you can only--they only had twelve students a year.  She said, "Sign up next year.  Go into merchandising."  And after the first year I didn't want to go into fashion design.  Merchandise was all business, wasn't even in fashion, and I really found out I liked business.  But what she did do, I was--I'd still hang out in the fashion department all the time.  She was not my official counselor, but I made her my counselor.  And she selected me to coordinate the fashion show one year, which I was really shocked, which was probably the first black person to coordinate the fashion show, and I was just honored (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, now what, what, what year did you start Mount Mary?
Speaker 2: In Mount Mary I went to--I started school in '73 [1973], '74 [1974], probably about '75 [1975].
Speaker 1: Seventy-five [1975], okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right, 1975, all right, so, so what happens next there now?  Did you end up getting a degree from Mount Mary?
Speaker 2: Yeah, twenty years later.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So something interrupted the--
Speaker 2: Well, what interrupted was that, at that particular time, Mount Mary had, very strict.  You had to have a master's degree to be a teacher, so they had very limited teacher, teachers.  And the one teacher that I had, he was probably like, taught six of my courses, maybe about five, three that I needed to have.  And I could never get over a C with him.  He wouldn't give me a C to save, save my life.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Like, he had things like what is accounting?  And I would say, answer the, the question, but he'd say no, I wanted it verbatim from the beginning of the book.  Or, I would get an answer right on my math test, but he said I didn't follow the steps.  So, because I didn't follow the steps, and even though I got the answer right, he gave me a U.  And I was like, really?  And so he was the only--and because of him, I needed a, a B in one of his courses, and he gave me a C.  So I walked the stage, and then they informed me, after I walked the stage, that I didn't get a B, and I need to pay another two thousand dollars or whatever to graduate.  And I was like, forget it, you know.  So I just went, you know, we started a business.  I became a manager of a clothing store.
Speaker 1: Okay, now you said we started a business.  Who, who--
Speaker 2: My, my ex-husband and my sister.
Speaker 1: So you were married by this time.
Speaker 2: Kind of--not really married, but--
Speaker 1: Okay, but you had--
Speaker 2: --with--right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But before then I had--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --got a job at--right after I graduated, I was the co-manager of a Limited clothing store.  And back then I was the third black--the third African American manager.
Speaker 1: Now the Limited, that was a--I think they're closed now I believe.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they are closed--
Speaker 1: But they were--
Speaker 2: --recently.
Speaker 1: But they were a--
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERUPTION)
Speaker 1: The manager, which was like the third African American manager in the whole State of Wisconsin.  And then I, I--
Speaker 2: Now was this store in a mall, or where was it?
Speaker 1: It was in a mall.  It was Capital Court--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --which used to be an enclosed mall that's now Midtown [Midtown Center], which was the only, really--next to Northridge [Northridge Mall], which became a, a destination for African Americans where in Milwaukee [Wisconsin].  But so, Larry, after I--then we started our own business for a while, called Ambiance [ph.].  And the name Ambiance came from the fashion show I design--that, that she, that Sister Heloise selected me to coordinate was called Ambiance.  So when we started a business, I was like, "Let's call it Ambiance."  So the business was successful.  It was a hair salon.  And then after that I went into radio.
Story_ID: 658342
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So were you managing--were you doing hair yourself, or did--you were managing--
Speaker 2: No.  I was just working the reception desk, keeping the books.  I was, ultimately I started doing wearable arts, and I was selling art.  We had a boutique inside of Ambiance [ph.] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But you would have known--well, I guess that you would have known a number of beauticians, having your, your, having, your mother [Bernice Swan-Edwards] having been a beautician and being raised in that, in a culture.  Is that, that true?
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And--yeah.
Speaker 1: But what about, now, now your sister, was she a beautician?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my sister was a hairdresser.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And so you know, then I started designing wearable arts, which was very successful.  And I started selling the art out of the salon, which was good because I could--I was kind of a housewife too.  And then after that, I, I went into radio.
Speaker 1: This, this is '81 [1981].  You did this from '81 [1981] to 1997.  You, you were living this life, as your, your little girl's [Tamara Stewart] growing up.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And so, yeah, I--so your, your, your little girl actually grows up while you're doing this, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So she's like in her twenties when you, when you finally--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --move on to radio.
Speaker 2: Right.  And so--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: In radio--
Speaker 1: Seems like you're too young for this, but I--(laughter), but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but that's--okay, I, I, I'm just, I'm kind of amazed that--okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So after the Ambiance, I decided I wanted to--I heard a commercial looking for account executives for a local radio station, so I decide to apply, because by then I kind of reached the artist block, even though I was successful with my art.  Urban League [Milwaukee Urban League, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] had hired me to do their mother and daughter event to make bags.  I had, I was going into the MPS [Milwaukee Public Schools] schools to teach the kids art.  But after a while I had a studio on top of the shop, 'cause we owned the building.  And--
Speaker 1: So was your daughter still at home then, or was she at college or--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, she's still at home.
Speaker 1: Okay, she's still at home--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, she--
Speaker 1: --starting up the radio station?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so my, my kids are twelve years apart.  So my son [Jamie Stewart]--I just have two kids.  They're twelve years apart.
Speaker 1: All right, okay, so he's still young.  All right, and what, this is 1997 when you, you become the--that you go to radio.  Is it, is it, is that it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I started radio--I was like thirty-seven when I got into radio.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So my son was like eleven years old.
Speaker 1: Okay, this, this is 1997, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So this is All-Pro Broadcasting [All-Pro Broadcasting, Inc.].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you answer the ad.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yes.
Speaker 1: So you didn't know anybody over there?
Speaker 2: No, just knew what they were advertising for, sounded like me.  So I figured that I would go and apply.  And I got the job, and ulti- ultimately became the general sales manager.  So at that point, I'm making more money than people who graduate from college, so I was like, why go back?  I, I was able to be a housewife, take care of my kids, a successful entrepreneur.  And then I thought at one point, I was like, you know what?  Enough of radio, you need to move on to something else, but you can't do that without your degree.
Story_ID: 658343
Speaker 1: So my best friend, Cecelia Gore [Cecelia Gore Bryant], sat down and said, "We're gonna make something happen here."  So she and I typed a letter to the president of Mount Mary [Mount Mary College; Mount Mary University, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] and said this, that I've been successful, you know, but I--in order for me to take the next step, I need to get the degree.  And they said you do.  They sent a letter back saying we're gonna have you talk to a counselor.  Take one course, get a B, and we'll give you your degree.  I got an A in the course.  It was business communication.  And during--it was evening course, an evening course.  And I remember they said, "You're gonna walk the stage again," 'cause I told my sister, "You're gonna come and see me graduate?"  And she was like, "No. I saw you graduate twenty years ago."  Called up my dad [Claude Edwards], "Dad, you're gonna come see me graduate?"  They're like, "No."  So, my sixteen year old son [Jamie Stewart] was at my graduation.  And at that point, Mount Mary was--and that was in 2002.  At that point, Mount Mary was still a very conservative Catholic school.  And I remember when I walked across the stage, my son hollered out, "Go, mama!"  And I was like, and I was like, he wasn't even born when I walked the stage the first time.  So it just never--that was just a--and I needed that to take the next steps in my career.
Story_ID: 658344
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now the next step, now you were successful at WJMR [WJMR Radio, Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin], right?
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: Jammin' 98.3.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I--
Speaker 1: And you received the Jammin' Legends award in 2004--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --I think, right, yeah.
Speaker 2: So with, with Jammin'--so I, I initially started with 1290 WMCS [WMCS Radio; WZTI Radio, Greenfield, Wisconsin].  I was there for two years.  The station was owned by Willie Davis [HistoryMaker Willie D. Davis], you know, Green Bay Packers, all-star--
Speaker 1: Right, running--Willie--
Speaker 2: --hall of fames.
Speaker 1: --right that Willie Davis
Speaker 2: Willie Davis owned 1290.  And--
Speaker 1: Super Bowl champion, Willie Davis.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I left 1290 after two years, and I, I, I left and went to V100 [WKKV Radio], which was a brand new hip hop station in Milwaukee [Wisconsin].  Back then we only had AM stations, and they were FM.  And Connie Balthrop was the owner of that station, which I also look as, as a mentor.  And she was a black woman.  It just took Milwaukee by storm, the first FM black station.
Speaker 1: Is, is, it was a hip hop station.
Speaker 2: Yeah, kind of, you know, it was R and B.  It wasn't quite hip hop.  It was really more R and B.  It's, it's more hip hop now.  But anyway, so I--
Speaker 1: 'Cause that was like what they call it best of the hits and dusties or something like--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  So, so V100 was really a great lesson, going from a small AM station to a big mega FM station.  I learned a lot about, you know, how to get the numbers together for your ad- for your agents, Arbitron [Nielsen Audio] numbers, learned a lot about having a promotions department, operational manager, really learned a lot on the business end.  So two years after I was there, Don Rosette called and asked me if I would come back to 1290.  And at that time I was like, tired of radio.  I said, okay, I'm gonna go back to 1290.  That's an easy--said, I'm gonna become a teacher.  And I'll stay there for six months and become a teacher, go back to school.  Well, six months turned into eight years.  And about a year after being there or less, I was promoted to general sales manager.  And so I liked Don.  He said--one thing I like about him--he was hard, but he was about his business.  But one thing he said--I said, "I don't know if I can be a general sales manager."  He said, "Why don't you go home and talk to your husband and think about it."  And he said, "Penny [HistoryMaker Penelope Stewart], let me tell you something."  He said, "The president was never a president until he became president."  I was like, hm, interesting, yeah.  He said, "So don't worry about not having experience as a manager.  You'll, you'll, you'll be fine."
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So now in 2000--well are any, you have, have any stories from your days in radio that you can tell us that, that--any dramatic stories?  I know you're often in the path of personalities and entertainers--
Speaker 2: Oh the--well, you know, the, yeah, you--the 1290 was a great learning lesson, a stepping stone for my next career.  They're still family.  The people that I worked with, we still, when we see each other it's like brothers and sisters.  1290 was special because it was talk radio.  And we had a host called Eric Von, who recently passed away.
Speaker 1: Right, yeah, we interviewed Faithe Colas [HistoryMaker Faithe A. Thomas-Colas] his wife earlier this week.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And so, well, the blessing is that who's who in the community would come to 1290 for the radio, so you had a chance to meet everyone.  I liked the fact that Don Rosette, if there was anything happening in Milwaukee, like any special events, he made sure his staff was there at any community event.  Ultimately, we were like this, we can't beat V100; we can't beat these other--Jammin', we can't beat those stations.  We're a small AM with a third of their audience.  So we, so what--we, we changed the, we changed our strategy and became more like a marketing radio station where we would offer advertisers opportunity to do interviews, opportunities to tag along on our heritage day, which was like an entertainment day, opportunity to tag along on our scholarship.  And so we would let them brand themselves in the community.  We were the voice of the community.  So by advertising and being at these special events, kind of gave them their outreach.  So that was a--so by doing that, I was extremely successful as it relates to breaking records, sales records individually, breaking records as a general sales manager.  So Don Rosette and I were a team and made history there by, by putting together a proposal that looked more like a marketing campaign versus just radio spots.

Speaker 1: Now in 2004, you-that's, this is when you moved to the hospital, right [sic.]? To--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And well how did that happen that you--now this is right after you finally got your degree, you know, on paper [from Mount Mary College; Mount Mary University, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I got my--
Speaker 1: Did you decide that you wanted to test it out and see--
Speaker 2: No, hospital [Columbia St. Mary's Hospital, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] was 2014.
Speaker 1: Two thousand fourteen [2014]?
Speaker 2: I got the degree in 2002.  And then I went to the BloodCenter of Wisconsin [Milwaukee, Wisconsin] as their community outreach manager.  So that's--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --why going from the radio station [WMCS Radio; WZTI Radio, Greenfield, Wisconsin], doing, going into a outreach position, I wanted to make a change.  And that's why I also went back and got my degree.  And I saw--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --this position that my friend told me about.  And she was like, "Penelope [HistoryMaker Penelope Stewart]," same girlfriend, Cecelia [Cecelia Gore Bryant].  And I read it.  Everything that they wanted I was like, I can do that; I did that.  They were looking for someone who knew the community.  But what I loved about that was it, it was about saving lives.  It was called the sickle cell initiative.  And I did my research, and I said wow, I can take all of my sale, I can take all of my sale skills, my skillsets, and take them and help save a life?  I was like, that's it.  And so I--
Speaker 1: Can you explain, just explain to whoever is watching this what sickle cell anemia is?
Speaker 2: So sickle cell anemia is when, you know, your red cells, instead of being round like a donut and soft, becomes sickle, like a sickle or a banana.  It becomes rigid, and they can't fit through the small veins, and so it's a disorder.  Primarily, it's an African American disorder.  There are some Greeks, Medi- Mediterraneans that will have it, but it's primarily an African American disease.  So people kind of talk about--they say people who have sickle cell really, it's like related to malaria.  There was this body fighting off malaria, malaria. But then the, but then, you know, things kind of--when you put two people who have sickle cell traits together, they have a, a one in four chance of their child having sickle cell.
Speaker 1: So correct me if I'm wrong, if you have a trait, then some of your blood cells are sickle, and that helps fight off the malarial virus.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But if all of them are, then you're really in trouble.
Speaker 2: You're in trouble.  And so you know, unfortunate thing, if sickle cell was the, is the biggest disorder, blood disorder, especially for African Americans.  And we always say if that was the case for non-African American, they would have found a cure or something.  But really it's about the education, to let someone know if you're gonna mate with someone, you need to get tested to make sure that they don't have a sickle cell trait, 'cause if they do, you have a one in four chance of your child having sickle cell anemia.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And you, you, two with the trait, you know, have running risk, right--
Speaker 2: Right.  So I worked with families that had two kids.  It's a horrible, horrible disease, the pain.  They have strokes at the--they can have a stroke.  And when they were training me, I literally cried when they start showing me the flow chart of a, a child who's like eight months having a stroke like an old person.  As soon as they get that blood transfusion they come back.  So, with sickle cell it's, it's a really serious illness that we think--I thought it was eradicated.  I didn't know that, 'cause back in the day they said James Brown made a deal with, I think it was Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon].  And I gonna vote for you, but give me something.  And that's when we had that big sickle cell campaign, when all the billboards was like, get tested, and then all that stopped.  So people think sickle cell doesn't exist.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was--
Speaker 2: And sickle cell--
Speaker 1: --they were doing a big public--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --campaign about it in the early '70s [1970s].  I know 'Tony Brown's Journal' featured it, all the major magazines, Essence, Ebony, Jet.  And then it seemed like it just fizzled.  Nobody talked about it, even though--so I don't know how many--do you have any idea what percentage of the African American community have it?
Speaker 2: It's like, you know, I, I think it's like one in twelve African Americans have sickle cell.
Speaker 1: Trait or the disease?
Speaker 2: I think one in twelve may have the disease.
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.  Maybe it's four in twelve have the disease.
Speaker 1: I've never met anybody that--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --had it until right after they started talking.  And I didn't know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --I met somebody--we recently interviewed the president of Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], Dr. Frederick [HistoryMaker Dr. Wayne A. I. Frederick].  He has it.
Speaker 2: Right.  And Larry [Larry Crowe], back in the--couple of years ago I could shoot off those numbers like that.  But the thing about it, if you look around your room of twelve people, somebody is there with sickle cell trait.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's--and if that person--one in twelve get together, it's, it's really a disease that's not talked about enough.  And it can be prevented by simply getting, having your blood test before you decide to have a child with someone.
Story_ID: 658346
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're at the community outreach--oh, you're the community outreach manager for the blood center here in Milwaukee [Wisconsin]?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then--
Speaker 2: And then, you know--
Speaker 1: --and then we were talking about sickle cell before we--
Speaker 2: Yes.  So after the sickle cell I did straight blood for about two years.  Had a chance--interesting, because you know, at the radio station [WMCS Radio; WZTI Radio, Greenfield, Wisconsin], I handled all the bar accounts.  And then when I went to the BloodCenter of Wisconsin [Milwaukee, Wisconsin], I was in every church, which is really, really a honor.  And it kind of--you know, you don't want to have the mic, but the pastors were like, "Tell, tell a story."  And I'm like, "Wow."  So kind of a full circle in my life.  So after two years, they asked me if I would manage the marrow department.  And that was--you know, I took on the challenge, and it was, that was something totally different.  I did both blood and marrow.  We were--I managed the only peripheral stem cell marrow department in the State of Wisconsin.  And don't ask me how I went--how I was able to go from art, radio, to now blood, to marrow.  But we were successful in putting together systems that we became the number two departments in operations really in the United States where doctors would call for people who needed a marrow transplant, because we were getting people in for that blood work like ASAP [as soon as possible].
Speaker 1: That's not easy to do, and you have to have some sales skills to persuade anybody--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --to donate marrow.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's one of the hardest things I--to do.  I know, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Like my manager Don Rosette, he said to me, the general manager, he said, "Penelope [HistoryMaker Penelope Stewart], you can pick some hard jobs, selling black radio is hard, now trying to get black people to donate blood and marrow," he said, "you know how to pick these jobs."  And I was like, "Yeah, but I say it's God," (laughter).  "God put you where you need to be."
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now this is quite, this is a talent that--so, so you did that for almost ten years, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, for about nine years I did blood and marrow. Grew the department to such a point that they needed a clinical person, a medical person to be in that position. And that medical side, that wasn't--I didn't want to sit behind a desk and just do charts and do documentations.  That wasn't me.  So you know, I had a conversation.  I think I downsized my own job, be honest with you.  I was like, "You need to have a nurse over this program."  We're, we're, we're going from two transplants a month to like twelve because our record is so good.  And you gotta--and the files for each donor is like this thick.  And you have to do complete documentation, talking about somebody's life, you know.  And it's interesting, to hold a bag and know that this is someone's life, because they have already been depleted of everything.  And if they don't get this donation they're going to die.  And so, so anyway, so they downsized my department, and the next step was Columbia St. Mary's [Columbia St. Mary's Hospital, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], which was another--I look at it as a blessing.
Story_ID: 658347
Speaker 1: So what happened?  Did they reach out to you, or did you see an ad, or how did you--now you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They downsized--
Speaker 1: --you were working in the medical field, so.
Speaker 2: Right.  So I went from like sales, medical.  We gave my blood accounts to the account executives and let them manage that [at the BloodCenter of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  And then I, I suggested to them that they needed to have--I really didn't mind being a outreach, but they needed to give that marrow department to someone who had--to a nurse, who had a medical background.  Like you said, to go from radio to now doing medical reports with no medical background, it was a challenge, but it was a challenge I accepted and I did very well at.  So when they di- downsized, they gave me a nice severance, which was a very nice severance.  And it gave me a time to kind of de-stress, and, and it really was a blessing from God because I needed to take that break.  And then this position came up at Columbia St. Mary's [Columbia St. Mary's Hospital, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], which now, it's back to working with primarily the churches again, whereas with the marrow department, kind of out of the churches.  But it's, it's about really saving lives again.  It's about educating our churches to, about chronic illness, giving them the information they need to have successful health ministries.  And then we just recently launched a Strong Baby Sanctuary campaign, which I'm just really excited about that because of our situation of being worse than some third world countries as far as our babies dying in Milwaukee [Wisconsin].
Speaker 1: Okay, I would just guess that part of your job in the beginning would have been to talk about the major killers of African Americans in terms of disease, high blood pressure, diabetes.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: What's the other one, heart disease (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Heart disease is number one for--for black females.  Diabetes is--yeah, was all the chronic disease.
Speaker 1: Yeah, a lot of it caused by diet, you know, or exacerbated through diet.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: High sodium, high sugar intake.
Speaker 2: Hypertension. If you have diabetes, you probably got a couple of other things going.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.  But so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But the, the, the infant mortality, that comes as, it came as a surprise for me when I read the information in the outline.
Story_ID: 658348
Speaker 1: Tell us about how you got involved in that, the Strong Baby Sanctuary program.
Speaker 2: So when I first started working at Columbia St. Mary's, which is now known as Ascension Columbia St. Mary's [Columbia St. Mary's Hospital, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], they had it.  They were working with the city, Milwaukee, City of Milwaukee Health Department along with Mayor Tom Barrett.  And they were hosting a one day, a luncheon, to tell the churches to have a one day pulpit message about infant mortality.  This is something that prior to me coming into--working at Columbia St. Mary's, they had hosted this for like the last four or five years, prior to me coming to Columbia St. Mary's.  And why--my job was a new job that was, that was created at Columbia because the Urban Church Wellness had like sixty churches, and the program became so successful that they needed someone just to manage those churches as far as providing them education.  So anyway, going back to the Strong Baby Sanctuary, is that, you know, we have a committee, united--a group of us, United Way [United Way of Greater Milwaukee and Waukesha County, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], March of Dimes [March of Dimes Foundation], the Milwaukee Health Department, Columbia St. Mary's.  We work together to coordinate--and March of Dimes--think I may have said that.  We work together to coordinate the lunch.  Well, after the first lunch, you know, after my first time putting together the lunch, we were like, this problem is too big--too big to make a one day pulpit message.  Too many of our babies are dying.
Speaker 1: How big of a problem is it?
Speaker 2: Every year around one hundred babies die in Milwaukee [Wisconsin].  It's a big problem.  Our infant mortality rate is worse than a third world country.  So out of those hundred babies, sixty, about 60 percent are black babies.  And so and primarily they're dying from prematurity, and that's the number one reason why our babies are dying in Milwaukee.  And there's a recent article that came out call- from the national that really documented it.  And primarily, prematurity has a whole lot to do with racism.  They thought it was a black thing, so to speak, that we her- her,- are heredi- that we're just naturally born, are made, that our babies will be premature.  But that's not true in Africa, so it's not heredity; it's not.  But they found--it's interesting that if African--if a woman from Africa come to America, within two years they said her, whatever's going on here, she's more likely to have a premature baby than if she was still in Africa.  So it's not a race thing.  So it's, it's bad.  If we're almost--we're worse than some third world countries.  So the article--
Speaker 1: But what, what, what are the conditions that exacerbate this problem in black women here.
Speaker 2: Stress and racism.  They boiled it down to you can be a, you can be a woman with a doctor's degree, a black woman, and compared to a, a white woman with no degree, that black doctor is more apt to have a premature baby.  It's--so the article really speaks to that's the stress factor, the racism.  You know, if you look at Milwaukee, we're number one in everything, number one in incarceration for black men, high school dropouts.  Look at our city.  We're so hyper-segregated.  I love my city, but it's not a good city for, for, for black people, especially for black men.  And so it's boiled down to the stress that comes from racism.  And then if you look at racism, look at the impact of unemployment, where you live, the crime, all the stuff that comes with you not having the opportunity.  It's just stressing our women out.  And then we have one doctor that, that spoke to the fact that the stress I will suffer will impact me to the point that it will pass down to my daughter.  So, it's a, it's a big problem, but I'm gonna keep faith going and say, you know, this is something that we can turn around.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  All right, so your, your role in the Strong Baby Sanctuary is as outreach coordinator, right, or I guess--
Speaker 2: Right.  What I, what I do, I really coordinate and facilitate all the meetings.  So we meet with the, the sanctuaries quarterly.  I de- help design the brochures.  I help with setting up training for them.  I surely keep the program going.  You know, I'm the one who connects all the connectors.  So I make sure that the City of Milwaukee, I'm working with their nurses to make sure their nurses are going to the churches, setting up all those meetings, coordinating all the events, doing all the, the PowerPoints for the events.  I'm actually writing the scripts for people, yeah, all those things that come--yeah. 'Cause somebody gotta keep the wheels going.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's my role.
Story_ID: 658349
Speaker 1: All right, well tell us about--there's, there's something called the Blanket of Love Program.  You, you play the same role with that program?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  So with the Blanket of Love, the Blanket of Love has been in existence for twelve years.  And it's really like a support group for young families.  They offer prenatal education.  And the Blanket of Love has shepherd--has really worked with 350 families in the last twelve years, and they have not lost one baby.  And this is working with young girls, pregnant teens, young pregnant mothers.  And so, the Strong Baby Sanctuary has started three years ago.  It was a pilot program.  But we saw it was not a pilot program.  It was something that was needed, that the people can go to the churches and, and have someone pray for them, try to reduce that stress factor.  But then we looked at the Blanket of Love Program last year.  And that's my colleague [at Columbia St. Mary's Hospital, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  I work hand in hand with Julia Means.  She's a nurse, registered nurse.  And we were like, something about the format of your program is working.  So now, we ask the sanctuaries if they would consider having a Blanket of Love Program. And they would meet with the families, one or two families or more, once a month, have a dinner, bring in some prenatal education, bring in education about the, what, how your baby should develop between zero and one year of age, 'cause the whole point of the sanctuary is to reduce infant mortality, which is death of babies before they turn one.  Our whole focus is that we want--help more babies celebrate their first birthday.  So the sanctuary--so, now we have ten churches that have stepped forward to Blanket of Love, so they'll have that closer connection with those families.  So when I kind of surveyed the twenty-five sanctuaries last October, asking how many families they had worked with over the last three years--two years, they had worked with like three hundred and plus families.  And none of were, none of the babies in our sanctuary have died.  So it's one thing to say we're gonna reduce infant mortality by 10 percent, and what does that look like and feel like?  When you can step forward and say we worked with three hundred, five hundred families, and we have not lost a baby--now some deaths we may not can prevent, a child getting shot.  But to be able to say we work with five hundred families and have not lost a baby, that's powerful.
Story_ID: 658350
Speaker 1: Now what, what factor was ma- what was the major factor in premature babies dying?  Is there any one thing, or--
Speaker 2: It's--and you know what?  It's, it's--stress is a big, is a big factor.  If you look at infant mortality, 60 percent are dying premature; 15 percent are safe sleep on--not in a safe sleep environment, you know.  So they're still studying that, Larry [Larry Crowe].  And like I said, it's--a recent article comes down to it's just, it's just the stress factor.  You know, it's the not getting that prenatal care, not going to your doctor early, not taking your vitamins, not taking folic acid.  It's like--
Speaker 1: So these are all preventative causes.
Speaker 2: Some things are preventable, and some things are not, 'cause you have women who would say I did everything right.  I went to my doctor.  I was on my vitamins.  I was taking my folic acid.  I was going to all my appointments, and my baby died.  I had a premature baby.  My baby died.  So, we really--unfortunately, it sounds, you know, so vague to say stress is a major problem.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's a lot of counseling I guess involved in it.
Speaker 2: Pardon?
Speaker 1: Lot of counseling involved in trying to alleviate--
Speaker 2: Yeah. So that's with the Blanket of Love [Blanket of Love Program], we want people to become, they want--I want to be your family.  I want to see some things going in your life--you know, my daughter-in-law is pregnant.  I was like, you know, she was, whenever she was stressed out I was like, "Don't stress.  Let's work this out."  You know you're stressing, you have a likelihood of--you can have a premature baby, and that's my specialty, not to have premature babies, you know.  And even half the babies--there're 15 percent who die in unsafe sleeping environment.  Half of them were premature.
Speaker 1: Okay.  When you say unsafe sleeping environment, what does that mean?
Speaker 2: Babies sleeping with blankets, babies sleeping on couches, people rolling over babies; all those factors come into play.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And even people being around babies sleeping, smoking.  But yeah, so it's not just rolling over your baby.  It's like, you know, we all--baby--not having the baby--you know, put the baby on the back versus the stomach, 'cause people think oh, if the baby throw up, you know.  But you need to have the baby on the back, no blankets; just put them on with a onesie.  They're fine, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And you know, our race, we, we, you know--and so we didn't want to focus on unsafe so much, more prematurity, because some of our culture is to sleep with that baby.  You know, and then the bad thing that happened in Milwaukee [Wisconsin] was like they were looking at it being, becoming punitive.  You know, then they were only highlighting some of the African American families that were losing babies on a sleep environment.  They even had a campaign where they said--they had a knife next to a baby, saying this is what it's like sleeping with your baby.  But we changed all that.  We said we're not gonna focus on that 15 percent.  Let's focus on the 60 percent.  And the thing, Larry, is that people didn't want to focus on that 60 percent because they didn't want to address racism.  And let's look, look it in the eye, and let's, let's address it.
Story_ID: 658351
Speaker 1: So now, so this has been going on since 2015, the Strong Baby Sanctuary?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we launched it in 2015, early 2015.  This is our third year, so our first year having ten Blanket of Love, because we figured that's a format that works.
Speaker 1: And your, you operate in how many churches?
Speaker 2: We have twenty-five sanctu- sanctuaries, and ten of those are Blanket of Love Programs.  We were launching them, kicking them off in Aug- in April.  Right now they're going through training with a nurse who will be their couns- couns- counsel, counselor, so that you have to have that educational part too, gotta be able to tell somebody, you know, "Baby, you gotta take your vitamins.  If you don't like these big fat vitamins, then go ahead and pay for those little chewable ones, you know."  So, yes.
Speaker 1: Now has the program been replicated in other cities, or--
Speaker 2: It's, it's--we're getting, we're starting to get calls.  We got a call from someone just recently, Julia Means.  And Julia Means is the one who had started the Blanket of Love, 'cause she said when she was a young mother she didn't have anyone to talk to.  She didn't know what to do.  Like when you asked me about who did I talk to, well, that's what the Blanket of Love is about.  Everyone doesn't have a mother that's gonna talk to them and tell them how to do things.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I think it will be replicated.  And I, I give God the glory, because we didn't beg for churches.  They came forward.  And we didn't know if this program was gonna work, and now it's working.  It's getting recognition.  We just received an award from BizTimes Media [BizTimes Media LLC, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] for the program.  We're starting to get more grants coming in, and our, our partners are expanding.  I give God the glory because you're like, "What are we doing?"  And then you go, "Wow, okay, this is working."
Story_ID: 658352
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now, what are your future plans, your plans to retire from this position [at Columbia St. Mary's Hospital, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] or to work to a certain age or what, what do you--
Speaker 2: I, I plan--
Speaker 1: --do you still has en- entrepreneurial plans and--
Speaker 2: Not entrepreneurial.  I don't, I don't--I plan a--I know it's kind of hard to say.  I figure like I have four years to hopefully, for retirement.  I think there's one big opportunity left.  And I'm, I want to take that one next--so I, I pray to God, and I put it in His hand and say--'cause as a child--and this is why I think my career has been successful, is because with my father [Claude Edwards] being a minister and being so entrenched in the church, my family, we used to have the horn of plenty, a picture of a horn, a horn of plenty.  And I remember as a child, about three years of age, when they would sit in the dining room and living room and talk church business, 'cause you know, you, church, church, church.  And I looked at that horn of plenty, and I would say, "God, let me be that vessel; let me--whatever You want me to do, I'm a--." And I think--so I put it in God's hand, but I, I know there's another opportunity.  And right now they're looking at trying to change my role, upgrade it, because, you know--but I want to make sure that I'm happy doing what I, what I, what I'm doing.  I want to make sure it fits into what I, what I enjoy doing.
Story_ID: 658353
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when you look back on everything you've done to this point, now is there anything you would do differently if you could go back and change something?
Speaker 2: Well, when you look at people who are retiring, being at one company for thirty years, but I don't think that was my role.  I don't think I would want to be some place for thirty years.  If I had to look at and doing anything differently, I don't think so.  I think everything that I've experienced has been a lesson for the next step.  And even if I didn't like something, God prepared me for the next step.  What I did at the radio station [WMCS Radio; WZTI Radio, Greenfield, Wisconsin] prepared me for the BloodCenter [BloodCenter of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  What I did at the BloodCenter prepared for Columbia St. Mary's [Columbia St. Mary's Hospital, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  And I continued to grow and learn.  And no, I don't think I would do anything different.
Story_ID: 658354
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: In Milwaukee [Wisconsin], it's that we have to change this.  We have to change--you should see African American men walking downtown in business suits.  You need to see African Americans successful, you know.  Milwaukee has a lot of work as it relates to black people being successful, the American dream.  I sent my daughter [Tamara Stewart] to Atlanta [Georgia], to go to Clark Atlanta [Clark Atlanta University], because I wanted her to see black people living in mansions, seeing black people drive cars, not drug dealers, but people in business, because if she stayed here in Milwaukee, she may never have had that aspiration to know she can do better.  So my hope for Milwaukee is that we gotta get these young people, and we gotta turn this situation around.  Milwaukee has to stop being one of the most racist cities in the United States.  There's a lot of work.  There's a lot of people, young politicians, Russell Stamper [Russell W. Stamper II], being positive things.  But I don't know.  It's gonna take, might need to take a new mayor, a new governor, but something has to change here.
Story_ID: 658355
Speaker 1: Okay.  It seems like the State of Wisconsin has become more conservative over the last ten years or so.  Would you, would you agree with that?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yes.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I know I remember when Tommy Thompson was elected governor and started rolling back on programs for the poor and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Right.  So I hope maybe Obama's [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] charged to say run for office; don't complain, run.  So I guess I would say to our young black people, run for office; make a change.  But I--
Speaker 1: Have you ever thought about running for office yourself?
Speaker 2: I thought about it a little bit.  But my Uncle Monroe [Monroe Swan] was the first black senator for, for Wisconsin.  So my--
Speaker 1: The state senator?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And my cousin, Polly [Annette Polly Williams]--
Speaker 1: So he's--
Speaker 2: --was a politician.
Speaker 1: --Monroe--
Speaker 2: Swan.
Speaker 1: Swan, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And so my cousin.  So I have, in my family there's politicians; there's obviously preachers and entrepreneurs.

Speaker 1: Now when you look back on everything you've done again, what would today you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: My legacy is that I, I tried to make a difference, that in my community, that I tried to make Milwaukee [Wisconsin] a better place, that I tried to uplift black people, that I tried to help save lives, if it was via blood, for patients who have sickle cell.  Right now is to educate people about preventative health.  My mother [Bernice Swan-Edwards] died from complications of diabetes.  I'm glad that I'm in a position where I can help educate the churches and people about diabetes, chronic illness.  I can help educate them about infant mortality.  We think this is normal.  When you step outside of Milwaukee and hear that this is--other states don't have babies dying like this.  You know, this is not normal.  So I want my legacy--legacy to be that I made a difference in, in, in, in the life of someone, that I tried to do something, not just about Penelope [HistoryMaker Penelope Stewart], but I made a difference trying to help people.
Story_ID: 658357
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell us about your family.  Now, you have two children, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I have a daughter, Tamara Cherise Stewart [Tamara Stewart], and a son, Jamie Alan Stewart [Jamie Stewart].  Like all parents, they're the joy of my life.  They're my heart and soul.  And I have three wonderful grandkids by my son.  They're nine, five, and one year of age.  And I have the one granddaughter and two grandsons.  But then I have, with my ex-husband, his grandkids are also my grandkids.  So I don't want to say I only have one granddaughter, 'cause I have several.  But they bring me joy.  They--I want to see them be successful.  They recently moved to Vicksburg, Mississippi.  And as I shared with you earlier, I'm like, now how did we make this circle, from Mississippi, Milwaukee [Wisconsin], back to Mississippi.  So my--I would like to be closer.  I don't want to live in Vicksburg, but I would like to be closer to my kids.  They mean a lot to me.  I wanna, I wanna experience their life.  I want them to know their grandmother, you know, so, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's Azor [Azor Stewart], Judah [Judah Stewart (ph.)], and Kerri [Kerri Stewart (ph.)].
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: They could have named her Penelope, but that's okay.
Speaker 1: Those are your grandchildren?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 658358
Speaker 1: Now is there, is, is there anything we haven't discussed that I need to raise or we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Well, just that I had other wonderful women who, if you want to look at Blanket of Love [Blanket of Love Program] being a program where you can have mentors, is my aunt Agnes [Agnes Swan] was the mentor who told me, who pushed me to go to college.  I just recently just went to a homecoming celebration last weekend for my best friend's mother, Barbara Johnson [ph.].  She was a mentor.  She was the one who brought me to Chicago [Illinois] and had me show my artwork, just, just showed me--you know, she was a great mother.  She was involved with the fair housing in Chicago, an advocate for fair housing.  She was a realtor.  And so I, I definitely want to acknowledge those women.  And I want to acknowledge, again, my, my sister, Ivory [Ivory Edwards Adkins], just the people.  And I gotta say my significant other, Percy Dorsey.
Story_ID: 658359
Speaker 1: Well, the last question is similar to legacy but a little different.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I want to be remembered as a person who enjoyed life, who lived it to its fullest.  I want to say not only tried to make a difference, but I love to dance.  I believe in trouble knocks at the door.  You know, you don't have to go look for it.  You know, don't start trouble in people's lives.  I want to be remembered as a person who loves life, loves people, just loves life.  I think it's so precious.  I believe, like Minnie Riperton said, "I believe in reincarnation, but I know about this life for sure.  So I'm gonna live it to the best I can."  And I believe in having a, the, the pie, as far as I believe in working hard, partying hard, and just living a full life.  I, I love my friends.  I, I, I was blessed to have a group of, of great friends, June Perry [HistoryMaker June M. Perry], Cecelia [Cecelia Gore Bryant], Joan Prince [HistoryMaker Joan M. Prince], Alicia [Alicia Love].  Everyone doesn't have that.  So I want my grandkids to say, "You know what?  Grandmamma was fun.  She celebrated holidays.  She'd go put on a crazy Christmas dress.  We would dance together.  She showed us how to cook.  But she took care of her business too.  She was an independent woman."  So I want--that's how I want to be--I want to be remembered as--that I enjoyed my life.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you.

Speaker 1: Okay, the first photo is of my great-grandfather, George Washington Swan [Stewart's maternal great-grandfather, Wash Swan], and he was born in 1854.
Speaker 2: That's my great-grandmother, Rachel [ph.].  She was my grandfather's [sic.] first wife.  She passed, and then he married Mariah [Mariah Swan].  But that's my great-grandmother.
Speaker 1: That picture is of my, my grandmother, Sallie [Sallie Swan].  Is, Johnson Swan [ph.] is, is the one that's seated in the chair.  And this was after my uncle passed away in the [U.S.] Army.  He was shot almost before he came home in a canoe, I heard, or in a boat.  All the family, those are of her kids.  And my mother is the woman that's far right.  And my grandfather [Wash Swan] is standing behind her.
Speaker 2: That's a picture of my grandmother, Sallie, and she was born in 1902.  She passed away in 1980.  I think, and this is not a derogatory term to say, bag woman.  And I call her the bag woman because she would always come and visit us.  She would catch the bus.  She would insist on catching the bus, and she would have all these bags.
Speaker 1: Those are my siblings.  And my mother was pregnant at that time with me, so that's why I'm not in the picture.
Speaker 2: Can you name everybody from left to right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  That's Robert [Bobby Edwards (ph.)], called Bobby, Claude, Jr. [Claude Edwards], Ivory [Ivory Edwards Adkins], and Donna [Donna Edwards Ciepluck].

Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: That's, that's me.  If you notice, on this picture, they put Penny Edwards [HistoryMaker Penelope Stewart], and then on the next picture Larry [Larry Crowe] has, it's called Penelope.  So you see, my nickname came early.
Speaker 1: And that's me as a baby.
Speaker 2: Peeking out from under a blanket.

Speaker 2: Faith Temple Church of God in Christ [Milwaukee, Wisconsin], my aunties back in the day when mini dresses were in.

Speaker 2: That's me, probably before I went to junior high school [Parkman Junior High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] or seventh grade.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)

Speaker 2: Four generations are on this picture.  I'm--me, my sister Ivory, my sister Donna, my grandmother, my mother, and my daughter Tamara [Tamara Stewart], so that's four generations.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's my dad and my mom.  They were like, clean, as you see.  They were kind of middle class African Americans.  I love that picture.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: That's my brother James, the one I said passed away at nineteen.  That's his singing group.
Speaker 2: What, what's the name of the group?
Speaker 1: I can't remember.

Speaker 2: How do you spell his name?
