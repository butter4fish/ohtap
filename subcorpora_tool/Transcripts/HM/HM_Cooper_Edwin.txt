Speaker 1: All right, my name is Larry Crowe.  I'm the interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, could you please state your full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Sure.  Edwin L. Cooper, E-D-W-I-N L., middle initial, Cooper, C-O-O-P-E-R.
Speaker 1: And what does your middle initial stand for?
Speaker 2: Lowell, L-O-W-E-L-L.
Speaker 1: All right.  And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: December 23, 1936 and I was born in a little village in Texas called Oakland, Texas which was actually the birthplace of my father and my grandfather and my great-grandfather.  My grandfather was Edmund Cooper who was in the civil war and his son was Alan Cooper.  My grandfather and his son was Edwin Cooper.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well I'm going to ask you about of your ancestors.
Speaker 2: Oh sorry, I don't want to get ahead of you.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And sir, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm a professor here at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles] and having been here a long time I have the title, distinguished professor now which is a rare title.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And a professor of--?
Speaker 2: I'm in the department of neurobiology but that doesn't make me a full fledged neurobiologist.  I'm a biologist with interests in several areas in biology and I happen to be in the neurobiology department.  I was hired here in 1964 and it was then the department of anatomy.  The name was changed to the department of anatomy and cell biology and then changed again to the department of neurobiology which has nothing to do with my main research focus.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is April 27, 2011.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We are in the medical school at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles].
Story_ID: 31048
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now before we go into depth, there are five lightweight warm up questions that we ask and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Do I have a favorite food?  Well first of all I like to cook.  I don't know that I have a favorite food.  I do like vanilla ice cream if it has no sugar in it and I figured out how to find some with no sugar and I like that.  I tend not to like meat anymore.  I'm almost turning vegetarian, but I'm not vegetarian.  I like chicken, I like fish, I like shrimp.  I don't know that I have a real favorite.  I really like food.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Food well prepared good looking food small quantities.  That's my taste in food.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: I like blue shirts.  Blue shirts and depending on the occasion I think a dark suit is appropriate for some occasions.  But I like blue.
Speaker 1: Now do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Spring is nice because spring for me means it's a rebirth.  Everything is coming alive again.  It's been dead during winter and so it's alive now and--there's a tree in front of my house and I watch it when it sheds its leaves and then everything gets sad and then all of a sudden now about the middle of April it starts to come out with green leaves and so that's nice.  I like spring.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Not especially because I don't consider myself ever on vacation.  I like to say sometimes that my whole life is a big vacation because I enjoy what I'm doing.  I go to France a lot and I go there every summer.  I like to go there but I take my computer and so it's not really--I don't go lying on beaches and things like that.  That's just not my way of doing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now the last question is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: At one time I wrote that in life you should aim as high as possible cause if you aim low and if you for whatever reason fall, you really have no place to fall if you aim too low.  But if you aim high and you happen by accident to fall, you still have somewhere to go.  And so that's, I think that's my favorite statement.  I don't know that it's entirely original but I've had that for my own personal philosophy.
Story_ID: 31049
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I'm going to ask you about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side of the family.  But we'll start with your mother's side first.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Her full name is Ruthester Porche Cooper.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: November 1, 1916.
Speaker 1: All right, and where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Yoakum, Texas.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And that's spelled--?
Speaker 2: Y-O-A-K-U-M, Yoakum, Texas.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Well it's very interesting you ask that because I'm involved with it at the moment now in following my family history.  We can go back through her father [Joe Porche] to his father [Pierre Porche] who was French from Louisiana.  And therefore my grandfather came from Louisiana to Texas and that's where my mother was born.  From her mother's [Hannah Hughes Porche] side, there's sparse history.  We--apparently she came from Virginia with her mother who was also a slave.  They came from Virginia.  My grandmother was not a slave.  She was born after the emancipation.
Speaker 1: Okay, but your great-grandmother was from Virginia?
Speaker 2: Apparently, according to what I can find she was from Virginia.  But then that's on my mother's-mother's side.  But my mother's father's side, her grandmother was born in Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And there I guess she met my great-grandfather and had children by him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your paternal great-grandmother was black and your maternal great-grandfather--?
Speaker 2: Well she was, yeah she was mixed but yeah.  Yeah, right.  She was--oh there are different stories.  There are different stories about her but with my grand--with her husband, my grandfather, it's fairly clear that his mother was maybe mixed, I'm not sure but definitely his father was French, the Porsche, Pierre Porche.
Speaker 1: Pierre Porche?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, who was my great-grandfather.
Speaker 1: That would place him as a great-grandfather.  Now let me see.
Speaker 2: That's right.  Pierre was my great-grandfather.  His son Joe Porsche was my grandfather.
Speaker 1: So that could easily place him in the middle of the 19th century too?  He, I mean Pierre Porsche, was he--?
Speaker 2: Apparently he was born about 1830.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: 1830, and my great-grandmother, his wife or concubine or whatever was born about the same time.
Speaker 1: Now what was her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was according to stories and pretty much pinned down now, her name was Julian, Juliana Porche.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now are the Porches related to the famous football player, Robert Porche that played for the Detroit Lions?
Speaker 2: They could be but not from any connections I have with my immediate family.  But I wouldn't be surprised.  I wouldn't be surprised.  But in my searches of Porsches from a place called Pointe Coupee Parish in Louisiana, there were a lot of Porches there.  A lot of Porches mixed, non-mixed but of course I'm only interested in those that I know who are my immediate and I'm working on trying to find that.  I've wanted to visit this town in Louisiana but I'm trying to find out as much as I can.  I don't want to fly there for nothing, you know.
Speaker 1: Um-hmm, So, Pointe Coupee, Louisiana, right?
Speaker 2: Yes is where they all came from.
Speaker 1: All right, and lots of Porches there of all complexions?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Story_ID: 31050
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  So now from what I understood in a conversation we had earlier that this Pierre Porche let some of his children have land or--was that true have land?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.  My grandfather [Joe Porche], his only son had a huge farm.  We went there at times when we were--every summer we would gather my own immediate family and then my first cousins would all come.  And we would gather for a huge barbecue under a big oak tree which apparently still stands.  I haven't been there in a while but I'm going next week.  He had about a hundred acres and then nearby he had a sister, one of my great-aunts by the name of Ada, A-D-A, Ada Young, Ada Porche Young.  She had a huge farm.  She had no children but she was responsible for educating some of my cousins, one professional especially. He was a dentist.  It was very interesting, dentist who practiced in Houston who was responsible for well as they said then, negroes voting in the primary.  And if you Google his name, you can find his name is Lonnie Smith Dental, a dentist.  The case was argued all the way to the Supreme Court and this makes an interesting story.
Speaker 1: So this is Ada Porche Young's son?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  No, she had no children.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But she took it upon herself to help with the children of her sisters, not from my mother's [Ruthester Porche Cooper] side because my grandfather took care of them.  They all went to college, except for my mother.  My mother did not.  But they all went to college but some of these others who apparently came from Louisiana, I don't know the exact story but Ada was fairly, the Aunt Ada, the sister of my grandfather was fairly well off apparently not only from what my great-grandfather [Pierre Porche] had given her but from her husband.  They had a huge farm.  I went there a couple of times when I was quite small and remember her quite well.  She took in this young fellow.  He was educated at Prairie View [Agricultural and Mechanical University, Prairie View, Texas] and then on to Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] and became a prominent dentist in Houston [Texas] actually.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he was a civil rights activist?
Speaker 2: My mother's been to the--yeah, my mother's been to the ceremony but I've never--ceremony for the dedication of that building but I've never seen it.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: His name is Lonnie Smith.  You can--he's in the history book, Texas history books and--
Speaker 1: I thought you were going to say he was related to the Youngs, Andrew Young or you know, 'cause the--Young's a dentist, too, you know and (unclear).
Speaker 2: In Houston?
Speaker 1: No, in New Orleans [Louisiana] but you know--
Speaker 2: I don't know.  No, when she came to--she apparently married Young in Texas but when she came, she was still a Porsche when she came from Louisiana to Texas with her--according to what I can find she came with her mother.  The father, Pierre, was not ever listed.  I can't ever find him in association with my side, but I did find my great-grandmother Juliana with my grandfather, Ada and two other sisters were farming with her when they were in Texas, when they got there.  And this was, the census was about 1880 I think.
Story_ID: 31051
Speaker 1: All right, now so your mother [Ruthester Porche Cooper] was raised there in Yoakum [Texas]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  She had--
Speaker 2: She went to high school in Yoakum and she married early at nineteen and she married because somehow through some other relatives she met my father [Edwin Ellis Cooper] and my grandparents [Joe Porche and Hannah Hughes Porche] wanted her to get married because she was the last in the family.  The rest had been educated and my grandparents were getting a little bit old and my grandmother was constantly ill.  And they said that we want you to be married to this nice young fellow, my father.  And so they insisted that she get married and so she got married at nineteen and then I was born a year and two months later.  She got married in 1935.
Speaker 1: Now did she have a chance too--now she had finished high school.
Speaker 2: She finished high school, yeah.  She finished high school but she never went to college.  Her sisters went to college.
Speaker 1: Now did she have any or did she share with you what her aspirations were at that age, what she wanted to do?
Speaker 2: She said she wanted to go to college but she never mentioned.  Now at that time her sisters all went to these normal schools they were called then to become teachers.  And most of them, in fact I think all of them were teachers, maybe elementary school or the equivalent of kindergarten, I'm not sure.  But they all were early college educated but not my mother and she resented it.  I know she resented it because as we grew older she constantly said I'm going back to school.  I'm going back to school.  And she eventually became a licensed vocational nurse and felt quite proud of it.  We didn't especially like it though because it left us in the house to come from school to an empty house and this was very strange.  But we didn't protest because we thought this was good that she wanted an education and did something about it.
Story_ID: 31052
Speaker 1: Now let me go to your father's side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes, Edwin Ellis Cooper.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: February 6, 1910.
Speaker 1: And where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Oakland, Texas.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you were saying that Oakland, Texas is like an ancestral home of the Coopers?
Speaker 2: It seems so.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Is there a story about them or your great-grandfather being from anywhere else other than there?  Or I mean how the family got or how did the Coopers get to Oakland?  That's what I'm asking?
Speaker 2: I think it was primarily through my great-grandfather [Edmund Cooper] when he was discharged from the Civil War [1861-1865].  Somehow he ended up in Texas and there they stayed.  Now his wife, my great-grandmother, I know nothing about her but I do know about my great-grandfather and I knew his daughters who were sisters of my grandfather, sisters of Allen [Gates Cooper].  I knew all of them.  I know some of their children.  Well one of them for example I see her sometimes when I go to Houston [Texas].  She's a second cousin.  We would say she's a first cousin to my father [Edwin Ellis Cooper].  Her last name is--maiden name was Prince.  Her mother married a Prince and she's now about 106 years old.  Incidentally, my family is rather long lived apparently.  My mother's [Ruthester Porche Cooper] ninety-four, all of her sisters lived to be about at least ninety years old.  My grandfather, her father, Porsche, Joe Porsche lived to be more than a hundred.  But back to my father, apparently they got to Oakland by my grand, my great-grandfather Alan--sorry, Edmund, Edmund Cooper.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Edmund Cooper was--now where was Edmund Cooper born?  Is there a story?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure, but from what I, from the computer, apparently it was either Missouri or Mississippi, I cannot remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.  But all of his children including my grandfather were all born in Texas, in Oakland.  I've seen the house where they were all living.  It's a, it was then probably a very nice middle class two story house.  It's nothing now.  It's deserted.  It's a ghost house now and it belongs to some of us but I mean who wants to do anything with it?  Oakland, Texas probably has a grand population now of about I don't know a hundred people at peak season.  And it never had too much more than that when my parents were married and went from Yoakum [Texas] to Oakland [Texas] to live.  That's where my father took her and that's where his parents were farming.  And--because Yoakum was big and rather progressive and my mother's side had, oh they had a car and they had a piano.  So they--and then they had this huge farm.  But my father's family had nothing.  They were just farmers who were doing nothing in--not well at all in Oakland.
Speaker 1: Now is Oakland a black town?
Speaker 2: Not then.  It was vaguely mixed as I recall.  I don't know what it is now though.
Speaker 1: But I was wondering if there was a tradition of it being founded as a black town cause--
Speaker 2: No.  No, I--
Speaker 1: --there are some of those in Texas.
Speaker 2: I, what do I--nearby is a city called, a town called Weimar.  Weimar was not and that's where my father's--we won't get on that, my father's mother's side came from.  It was not entirely black at all.  But Oakland I think was mixed when they were, when they moved there which was 1935 and I guess my father started a farm but it didn't work.
Story_ID: 31053
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, all right now your great-grandfather Edmund Cooper, born in either Mississippi or Missouri.  Now he was a Civil War [1861-1865] veteran?
Speaker 2: Exactly, yeah.
Speaker 1: And you said he served in a capacity--?
Speaker 2: It was listed on the discharged papers as a server I think.  I have a picture of him, I don't have it here but I have a picture somewhere of him.  I have his discharge papers.  And one of his daughters, my great aunt, gave me the, all of those papers and gave me the discharge papers and his flag.  And I took out the flag and unrolled it once because I wanted to see if it had the number of stars during the Civil War or what it--but it had forty-eight, it had, we had still just forty-eight states then so it had forty-eight stars.  And I have it folded up at home.  And she wanted me to have it because it had been passed to her.  She kept it from my great-grandfather and she wanted me to have it because I was the oldest Cooper son still living and she was very much concerned about our name being carried on so much so that she, she made a huge difference.  This is a great aunt, my father's [Edwin Ellis Cooper] aunt, the daughter of Edmund [Cooper].  She made a huge difference between me and my brothers and my sisters, I mean to the point that she rarely just speak with them to be polite and then after that she would constantly talk about how great her Cooper nephews were starting with me.  And that's why I have all of the memorabilia from her.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he, apparently he was born, he was at least maybe eighteen when the Civil War was going on at least.
Speaker 2: Something like that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you have a birth date for Edmund Cooper?
Speaker 2: It's 1830, it's around 1830.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: It's around 1830.
Speaker 1: Born around 1830 and--
Speaker 2: About, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, and he lived until 1930--?
Speaker 2: '36 [1936] apparently he died, yeah.
Speaker 1: '36 [1936], okay.  Now was he over a hundred?
Speaker 2: You ask me that now if we did the calculation maybe my calculations are off.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he'd be 106 but I just wonder maybe he--?
Speaker 2: That I'm not clear on.  I know that he died according to my mother's writing on the back of a photo he died in 1936 which was actually the year that I was born.  But maybe--
Speaker 1: Well he probably was at least ninety-something you know, at least because --
Speaker 2: I would think so.  All of my relatives from both sides were long-lived people, very, very long.
Speaker 1: We would figure in the Civil War there were some children who served in the civil, in the Union Army, drummers and different, and servants and that sort of thing.  But I--
Speaker 2: I don't think he was in Union though.  I think he was in the Confederate.
Speaker 1: In the Confederacy?
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the flag, his flag was that an American flag or the--?
Speaker 2: No, it's an American flag.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  But you think he served in the Confederacy?
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: They, the thing about it though in the Confederacy, they wouldn't give you a discharge 'cause you wouldn't be formally inducted.
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: You know, not--I mean there are rare instances where you might be--in fact there's a big debate about that now about what was the black participation in the, on the, in the Confederacy.  And it, the general feeling is mostly slaves you know.  If you had a slave just make them do what they were doing on the plantation.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: And you know, and there weren't armed battalions 'til just at the very end they armed some soldiers out of desperation in Petersburg [Virginia] to defend Richmond [Virginia].  But it didn't really pan out too well.  So that's--
Speaker 2: I have to delve a little bit more into that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know--but I do have the papers and it's the one sheet and badly worn and I've had it framed and I've copied it.
Speaker 1: If the discharge is from the United States government that means he served in the Union army.
Speaker 2: Really?  Okay.  No, it's from the government, there's a big eagle on it and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's from--he served in the Union army.
Speaker 2: In the union army.
Speaker 1: He didn't serve in the Confederacy, no.  They--
Speaker 2: So if he was in the union army he would have to be in a non-slave state and--right?
Speaker 1: No, because slaves were flocking to the union army as they went to through the South.  That's how they were in--they were joining groups.  They were being mustered in as soldiers along the way.  Eventually that's what happened and they filled the ranks, some depending on your capacity what you were able to do.
Speaker 2: Well this is I don't know.  I'd have to delve a little bit more.  I know he's in the computer.  I found some information from the computer.
Speaker 1: But a discharge would also suggest he got paid.
Speaker 2: He got what?
Speaker 1: He got paid.
Speaker 2: Oh really?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: Cause, I mean there were former slaves that ran to the union army who served and did things but they weren't on the rolls.
Speaker 2: Oh really?
Speaker 1: They just got food and (unclear).
Speaker 2: I wouldn't be surprised if he got paid because the house that he lived in it was a fine two story house and now it's a piece of, I mean it's, it's nothing there now, broken windows and it's a ghost house now.  But it was very nice at one time and then surrounding it were a couple of other houses that were the houses of his daughters.  One of the daughters was the one that gave me the flag and this document and there's another one, the--nearby, another big two story house and that one, the daughter of that particular one is one now who is--she's about 106 I think.  All of these are my father's first cousins.  My father would have been what, this year it's--he would have been 101 this year in February.
Story_ID: 31054
Speaker 1: So what did your great-grandfather [Edmund Cooper] do for a living?
Speaker 2: Well I guess he came and farmed but then he became a minister.  He's listed as a Methodist minister and this aunt who gave me the flag and--she always was quite proud of this that he became a minister after being in the military.  Now I'm fairly certain that he didn't, I don't think he had any formal training to become a minister but it was apparently strong enough so that it, he was recognized as a Methodist minister.  And through that my wife eventually--not my wife, my mother [Ruthester Porche Cooper] eventually lost the Catholic-Baptist tradition after marrying my father and became Methodist, M.E. [Methodist Episcopal] Methodist, not A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] Methodist.
Speaker 1: Okay, now the M.E. Church, a lot of blacks in the M.E. Church in Texas and I know that and you actually to a salary from the M.E. Church.
Speaker 2: Oh really?
Speaker 1: Yeah, cause the bishop there is like bishops and a hierarchy.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so it's--they actually provide a salary for the ministers.
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: So that might have been a good, real good position to be in.
Story_ID: 31055
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So we were talking about your great-grandfather [Edmund Cooper].  So he was a civil war veteran and he--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --became a Methodist Episcopal Minister in Texas.
Speaker 2: And farming.
Speaker 1: And so he managed to do fairly well.
Speaker 2: Fairly well and he had about, it was about eight children, one of whom was my grandfather, Alan Gates Cooper who was the father of Edwin Ellis, my father.
Speaker 1: Now are there any stories about Alan Gates Cooper?
Speaker 2: No, not especially except that he and my grandmother [Eula Jones Cooper] moved from Oakland, Texas to Houston [Texas] with the help of my father.  My father was, didn't go to college because he was sort of appointed by my grandparents to help them get ahead in life which always sort of angered my mother [Ruthester Porche Cooper], created a lot of conflict.  So after they were married, moved to Oakland, my grandparents decided that they should go to Houston and try and pick up and do something about their lives and my father was to help them do that, which he did.
Speaker 1: You mean by working and--?
Speaker 2: Well helping them acquire--my father had a job to take care of us but he was also in spare time, was, it was essential that he help his parents which my mother resented all the time.  But my--had a--if you want to get on to my grandmother, my father's mother, she was a very demanding woman with very good taste, very talented, very ambitious, more than my grandfather.
Speaker 1: Now what was her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Eula, E-U-L-A Jones Cooper.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was born in Weimar, Texas, W-E-I-M-A-R, Texas.
Speaker 1: Okay, now you said she--
Speaker 2: It's a little town ten miles from Oakland, Texas where my grandfather was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You said she was talented and ambitious.
Speaker 2: Talented, ambitious.  When--she and my grandfather had menial jobs when they were, when they came to Houston, but they managed, really managed well with the help of my father to buy houses and to rent houses.  My grandmother was never satisfied with what she had.  She studied upholstery and used to do this as a kind of business, refashion chairs.  She decided that she wanted a little grocery store and she set up a little grocery store and of course I greatly identified with her with this being meticulous and ambitious and so I became the one in charge of her tiny grocery store which she was glad to delegate to me because I at a young age was pretty well organized and that was fine for her that I, that I'd take care of this.  And I really enjoyed, a tiny little room but it had this and this and this and this and people from the neighborhood would come and buy stuff and that suited her just well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they were really ambitious.  Now this is, I guess we're talking about--so would you say that they moved to Houston [Texas] during the depression?  You think that had something to do with the economic crisis?
Speaker 2: Oh probably did because--probably it did because in Oakland, Texas nothing was happening in their life at all.  I was born there, one of my brothers was born there, the brother that I'm going to go see this ancestry business next week.  He and I were born there and then my parents moved from Oakland to, Oakland, Texas this tiny place to Houston to pick up their lives and to help my grandparents.
Speaker 1: Now was your grandfather a World War I vet?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he didn't go.
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no.  But my--no he was not a World War I vet, he was not.  But my father's brother was in, I guess it must have been World War II.  His name was Eugene and he was in World War II.  My father didn't go because we were--by the time the war broke out which was what, 1941, my father had four children so he was deferred because of having four children and also because of having a hernia so he was not taken.  But his brother served in the military.  I knew him.
Story_ID: 31056
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now what did your--your father [Edwin Ellis Cooper] have any special stories about growing up that he shared with you?
Speaker 2: No, because my father was a shy man, ambitious, hard, tenacious or hard working.  Not at all particularly well read.  I think he probably finished maybe through the sixth grade, maybe while he was in Oakland [Texas] and then he was commissioned by my grandparents, especially my grandmother to farm, to take care, help take care of them.  But they managed to send their daughter and his brother, I think they also went to college for a short time, maybe one of these normal schools.
Speaker 1: Now did your father have ambitions that he shared with you about what he wanted to do?
Speaker 2: No.  No.
Speaker 1: So he didn't feel frustrated that he didn't go to school?
Speaker 2: He didn't, no he didn't but I think he had a chip on his shoulder because he didn't do it but then he didn't have the drive to do it.  His drive was to just do something simple with his hands.  For example, he built the house which we sort of grew up in.  He worked a regular job as a, oh he worked at Sinclair Oil as sampling oil from tanks.  That was his routine job and really routine, no imagine, nothing, just sampling.  But it provided a good income for him and to help us.  But then his spare time was spent building for us and then building for his parents [Eula Jones Cooper and Allen Gates Cooper], you know acquiring these rental properties which we learned early enough when I was quite small that I didn't want anything to do with those places because we'd have to help my father.  We learned a lot from him, how to paint, how to hang wallpaper because my grandmother [Eula Jones Cooper] was demanding.  They had to be--her places had to be clean where she lived.  They had to be painted, bricks had to be laid and so we had to do it.  And so I--but I said then that if I ever became able which I probably knew that I would, I would never have anything to do with rental property.  I found it distasteful when your every free moment there was something wrong with one of the houses, the plumbing and then my father would have to leave and go over there which would infuriate my mother [Ruthester Porche Cooper].  And I mean it was constant conflict because of my domineering grandmother.  But I liked her.  I liked her because she knew what she wanted and it was always the best and she was tenacious and my father got that from her but then he didn't get, he didn't--he was not an--ambitious in the educated sense but he really was, he felt, I think he felt self-conscious about it because he resented some of his cousins who had gone to college and who were a little bit traveled and certainly he didn't particularly like some of my mother's relatives either because many of them were really quite well educated.  And he always felt self-conscious about it, really very, very self-conscious.  But his amazing characteristic was the capacity to work hard to be able to do certain sorts of manual things and to be tenacious.  He stuck with things.  I learned from them also which I still do now, I learned from both of them, from my father and my mother how to save.  I still to this day save plastic bags, I save aluminum foil, I don't buy any of that stuff, you know I save it.  I reuse aluminum foil in the kitchen.  You know you wash it and let it dry and reuse it.  Why do I have to waste my time going out and buying this kind of thing?  So I learned a lot, how to do inside jobs, hanging wallpaper and painting.  And, I don't do it now.  I refuse now.  I've had enough of that you know in childhood and now I just, if it's got to be done then I pay to have it done.
Story_ID: 31057
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, now is there a story about how your parents [Edwin Ellis Cooper and Ruthester Porche Cooper] met?  I know you told us before that her--your mother's parents [Joe Porche and Hannah Hughes Porche] kind of pushed her to marry your father but how did they meet?
Speaker 2: From what I can gather from her earlier is that her sister, one of her sisters lived also in Oakland, Texas because she married a teacher and they knew my father.  And somehow in the current terminology they were, my parents were fixed up.  They were by this sister.  And my grandparents liked him very much, my father, and said to my mother you should marry this young man.  He's a fine young man.  And I don't think my father was a particularly romantic man.  I mean he's just you know hard working and tenacious and--but I think there was a nice courtship.  They--he would come from Oakland [Texas], drive from Oakland to Yoakum [Texas] to visit my mother and then my mother went to Oakland to visit his parents.  And my grandmother apparently immediately liked my mother very much and approved of it so they got married in Yoakum at a reasonably large wedding apparently and then went on to Oakland to live where it was a big disappointment to my mother coming from Yoakum.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oakland was just the sticks she would call it.
Story_ID: 31058
Speaker 1: Now how many brothers and sisters do you have and where do you fall in the order?
Speaker 2: I'm the oldest.  Can't you tell?
Speaker 1: We don't have the rest of them here to compare.  But--
Speaker 2: No they would say no, he's the oldest.  No, I'm the oldest and we are five.  There's another brother who was born in 1938 and then another one '39 [1939] and then a sister born in '41 [1941].  She was born two weeks after Pearl Harbor.  I'll never forget that because I remember my mother saying that she went in for her last examination on December ninth and my sister was born on December 19, 1941.  And then another sister was born in '47 [1947]  and that sister, the youngest one now is the one who is taking complete care of my mother [Ruthester Porche Cooper] who is pretty much mentally alert at ninety-four, but she's essentially an invalid.  She cannot do anything without mobile help.  She went from a walker to being almost totally helpless.  But her mind is still reasonably good now.
Speaker 1: Now do you care to name your brothers and sisters for us?
Speaker 2: Yes.  The one after me who is two years, born in '38 [1938] is Joe, named for grandfather Porsche.  His middle name is Allen, named for grandfather Allen Cooper.  Phillip, I'm not sure where his name came from and his middle name is Rochelle.  My sister after him is named Hannah for our maternal grandmother, Hannah Hughes Porsche.  Her middle name is Beatrice which is the middle name of my paternal grandmother [Eula Jones Cooper], my father's mother.
Story_ID: 31059
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now when you consider your parents'--now you've addressed this somewhat but we always have to ask it formally.  But when you consider your parents' talents and their dispositions and their intellect, their political ideas, I mean and interests, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: It's probably after my mother [Ruthester Porche Cooper] I would think because there's a pretty long documented history of education in a certain middle class with--from her side that didn't come from my father's [Edwin Ellis Cooper] side.  And what came from my father's side, he seemed to push it back.  He didn't want anything to do with it because for whatever reason he was by disposition self-conscious or he just wanted to work and stay by himself and not deal with his, I don't know his relatives who were educated.  So I think that probably the influence comes from my mother.  She was always very active with us at school.  She was always visiting school and then coming--her own family, she'd tell stories of her mother Hannah [Hughes Porche] who was I don't know part of the PTA [Parent-Teacher Association].  Can you imagine part of the PTA of my mother's elementary or high school in Yoakum, Texas of all places and that she was the secretary of some women's group in the church.  Well, being in the country I find this very impressive coming from a small town like that and being farmers that her mother was this involved.  And my mother stayed a bit involved like that with us and always resented that she didn't have an education like her sisters did.  So everything points to my mother being the more cultivated or the more educated person.  My father was always for it, did it for a moment but he didn't, he wanted no part of what we had to do in school.  He was just there to work for us and it was sometimes a little clumsy, a little awkward I think.  But--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Can I step out for a just a moment?  Are we near-- (BRIEF PAUSE)
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well we were talking about your--
Speaker 2: Where were we?
Speaker 1: --who you took after the most and you were saying your mother.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so--
Speaker 1: But I think we've pretty much got that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 31060
Speaker 1: And so we'll move on to next question is, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: An earliest childhood memory?  I don't know if it's a memory or if it's a dream and that I've made it into a memory.  But I do remember that I was kind of a--when we--I grew up for two years in Oakland, Texas, this little village.  And I remember that I was a favorite of this aunt who gave me the flag and gave me the document of my grand, great-grandfather's [Edmund Cooper] discharge.  And I remember that there was one, another aunt who apparently helped to deliver me because I was a very large baby and the first one.  And apparently it was a very difficult delivery.  So I became a kind of story in this little village of being hard to be born and quite large.  And I do remember times when I was quite young that being this favored Cooper boy, being taken to some little store in Oakland [Texas] that sold candy and I could have any piece of candy that I wanted.  And I don't know if that's a dream or if I'm back to my memory.  But I do know that aunt, not the aunt that gave me the flag but another one and apparently that aunt was one who helped to literally push me out.  Because the attending's physician--I weighed twelve pounds and my mother [Ruthester Porche Cooper] weighed a hundred pounds and we didn't know it then but we know it now that a--when you have a large baby it's likely that the mother is diabetic or will become diabetic.  That's known now and so I'm concerned about my own capacity to develop diabetes.  My mother is diabetic but she and my father [Edwin Ellis Cooper] became diabetic at senescence, at middle age.  It's not like this epidemic we're having in the United States with teenagers and younger becoming too fat and diabetic.  So it was a difficult delivery.  Now where were--I'm getting away from the story now.  Yeah, and I remember some stories about my mother saying that this was one of the only times that she'd seen my father extremely emotional and trying to get me out was really apparently a difficult job even though she had a good physician and a village like that.
Speaker 1: It was a long labor?
Speaker 2: Yeah, several days and the first one, she's a hundred pounds and I'm twelve pounds and apparently it was not very pleasant.  So the, maybe there was the equivalent of a mid-wife but then there was one aunt, not the one who gave me the flag and the documents but another one who helped with this. Well that, that's, I don't know if that's the kind of story you'd like to remember or to--
Speaker 1: Well that is quite a story.  I mean very few people have a story about birth that they can share and that's an interesting story.
Speaker 2: Yeah, no my mother--
Speaker 1: Were the other babies large too or--?
Speaker 2: Not my next brother but the one after [Phillip R. Cooper] I think was nine pounds.  But the others were normal size.
Speaker 1: My recollection of the whole, the statistics on that is most black children now are about six and a half pounds, that's about the average.
Speaker 2: That's what it should be.  But during the time of my growing up, everybody was advised that mothers should eat.  Eat, you eat, you have to feed yourself and you have to feed the fetus and the infant.  You have to feed, feed, feed.  That's not what you do.  If anything you should lose weight during pregnancy, not gain weight.  If you gain weight something is wrong and a good obstetrician instructs pregnant women to not gain weight.  It's just not what you do.  But that wasn't the thing.  It was similarly with--I mean my parents' generation was educated or urged to gain weight.  I mean I remember going to these family reunions and having everybody say look how wonderful you look, you're so fat.  I mean I would never now tell anybody look how wonderful you are.  Look how fat you are.  I mean this is not--but there was so much talk around how big you had become and there are pictures and my mother learned later on that this was wrong and she spent a lot of time losing weight and she did.  She got it back down to where she almost was when she was, when I was born.  But I mean nobody in their right mind seeks to gain weight now.  It's just too well known that this interferes with health.  There's too much associated with it.  That's why the President's wife [Michelle Obama] and a lot of other people are telling us we've got to change our habits.  We don't need all of that food.  It's wasteful and it makes us fat and it's not good.
Story_ID: 31061
Speaker 1: As a biologist you, I mean are, I mean do--okay, is this your opinion as a biologist or is this an average--?
Speaker 2: No, it's my opinion as a biologist and I listen to what others are saying.  And it's unfortunate that it's becoming a kind of political thing.  People are objecting to the fact that Mrs. [Michelle] Obama is saying oh you should not eat this or take out the sugar and this so some are making a political thing out of it and saying that so the White House or the government now is telling us what we should eat.  Yes, we're telling what we should eat.  We should have vaccinations.  We should have chest x-rays.  We should--that's all for the benefit of the society.  So as a biologist and certain things that politicians advocate, I agree with it.  We don't need the kind of food that is produced, mass produced in order to survive.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We need more plants than meat and less carbohydrate.  You know it's--
Story_ID: 31062
Speaker 1: All right.  So now I read that as a youth you were interested in animals and--well tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, when I was growing up--in Houston [Texas] where we lived was obviously not too affluent but my parents [Edwin Ellis Cooper and Ruthester Porche Cooper] saw to it that we had a decent house until my father [Edwin Ellis Cooper] could afford to build a bigger house.  I remember it raining in Houston and raining so much that the streets were flooded.  And when the floods would go down, I had a, I used to like to go out and there were a lot of crawfish around.  And crawfish burrow down into the ground and they come up--as they're boroughing deeply they come up and they pile the dirt on top.  Earthworms do the same thing.  So I discovered that if I could catch a crayfish, if they would build these round droppings of earth around their hole I thought, how am I going to get the crayfish out?  So I'd take a piece of meat, put it on a string, then have a stick ready that I would be able to poke and so I would lure the crayfish as far to the top as possible and then jam the stick to block the entrance to the hole.  And then knock down the dirt and there was my crayfish so that's how I used to capture crayfish.  And I would--that was one of my favorite animals when I was little.  Also, earthworms, I liked them a lot too because I could put them in jars from my grandmother's [Eula Jones Cooper] store and watch them live through the jar which have now become commercial terrarium.  You know you can buy these ant farms and--for children.  Well I invented my own then.  They didn't have them when I was growing up, but leftover jars.  And I still save jars now around.  I don't use them to watch crawfish anymore.  I liked also insects, especially--my father was always concerned about us getting too close to insects and being stung by insects so he was protective.
Speaker 1: So you weren't afraid of them at all?
Speaker 2: No.  No I wasn't afraid of them.  What I would do especially with wasp nests, in Houston [Texas] they would build nests in the eaves of houses and they would gather on the outside.  They'd make them sometimes that big and they had cells, you know holes in them.  I discovered really quite young that they would--they lay eggs in there and depending on the wasp, they would put a larva of some other kind of animal in so that when the young would emerge they would have something to eat.  And then they would also close up these cells and if--they secrete something that's more or less like paper.  Anyway, my--well there's one called, a common name called yellow jacket.  And they, I would see my father [Edwin Ellis Cooper] occasionally go and take a long stick, tie newspaper around it and set it afire.  And he would then take that and shove it against the nest to kill the adults that always stayed on top of the nest to guard the nest.  And I thought this was cruel but of course I was obedient and wouldn't tell my father that this is cruel to kill the wasps.  So when he would, when he--the paper would burn out and all the adults were on the ground dead, I would go back, knock down the nest because the nest was not burned but it invariably had a lot of premature young ones in these cells and I'd keep those off on the side and let them grow out, save them you know without telling him of course.  And I remember him mumbling, I've written about this somewhere that he'd walk away and said oh, it's necessary to kill those old yellow jackets because they will sting you if you don't watch--
Speaker 1: Were you ever stung by a yellow jacket?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think so and bees also.  I used to collect bees.  I figured out how to collect bees.  I'd take a clothespin and when I'd see them alight on a flower I'd take the clothespin, I'd open it up and pinch them on the wings and catch them like that.  I never--but I've gotten stung by bees too.
Story_ID: 31063
Speaker 1: Now what was the name of the neighborhood you lived in, in Houston [Texas]?
Speaker 2: The first neighborhood I don't remember the name of it.  I do remember though that it was close enough to my first elementary school and my mother [Ruthester Porche Cooper] would always walk us there and then I think we had to take a bus.  And I remember--I don't remember the name, that it even had a name.  I--
Speaker 1: You remember what ward it was in?
Speaker 2: The second house, the big house where my father [Edwin Ellis Cooper] moved us was in the Heights, in the north part of Houston.  And of course now it's all vague because Houston is so different now from when I grew--I left in '57 [1957] and I don't even recognize it anymore.  And all my relatives live outside of it.  What was I saying?  The sec--I don't know where it was. I don't know.  I wouldn't even remember hardly how to get there.
Speaker 1: But I know they identify a lot of neighborhoods by wards.
Speaker 2: Third Ward, yeah.
Speaker 1: Third Ward, Fifth Ward.
Speaker 2: They, when they came from Oakland [Texas] to Houston when I was two years old.  They went with some of my father's [Edwin Ellis Cooper] maternal relatives in the neighborhood of Third Ward in Houston, that I remember.  And then I went to Yates High School which is Third Ward.
Speaker 1: Was that your neighborhood school?
Speaker 2: That was the neighborhood school.  That was the neighborhood--that was my neighborhood high school definitely.  And that's where, same region is where Texas Southern [University Houston, Texas] is which is where I went for my bachelor's degree.
Speaker 1: I think that's Third Ward.
Speaker 2: That's Third Ward and Third Ward--the high school, Yates High School they give you some famous names.  I didn't know her then cause she's younger.  Felicia Rashad was a student there and her sister Debbie--
Speaker 1: Debbie.
Speaker 2: --Allen.  Also there's a political fellow from Chicago [Illinois], what's his name, who went there also but younger.  He's on a group of commentators about four people and he went to Yates also I found out that recently.  What is his name, balding, kind of heavy and he's from Chicago.  He's on, he has a radio station in Chicago.  He's on--well I can't remember his name now but he--to name people who were there.  So, that's where I--Third Ward was my primary growth period I think, the elementary part.  I can't remember where the house was.  I know where--the school has been reconverted to something else now where I went to elementary school.
Speaker 1: And what was the name of your elementary school?
Speaker 2: Luckie, L-U-C-K-I-E.  And then my parents moved to the north part of Houston in a house that my father built called the Heights in the northern part of Houston.  And I went to Burris, B-U-R-R-I-S Junior High School.  And my parents were never quite happy with the school so they moved from one place to another so we could be in better schools.  Burris, he built a house exactly across the street from the junior high school and there I learned then how to walk to school.  I live in this neighborhood here and I walk everyday.  I don't drive here.  I did it when I went to Texas, Southern.  We moved to another neighborhood which is around the Third Ward, three blocks from Texas Southern.  I walked there.  So that's--Yates High School is where I went to the high school graduating--
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, in that (unclear).
Story_ID: 31064
Speaker 1: Well I'm going to get that but we always ask this question and can you describe your neighborhood and what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well where I grew up about the crawfish story and all the rain, that was a poor place, very, very poor.  Obviously there was a lot of water everywhere.  There was no city sewage system to get rid of--well there was a sewage system but no system for getting rid of water after rain, a good system.  Then we moved, my father [Edwin Ellis Cooper] built a house and we moved to the Heights which was quite a step up because he built a huge two story house and there we grew up and I went to junior high school and there was a usual church, there was a--that was fairly middle class that neighborhood, the Heights.  Then we moved to what was formerly the main Jewish neighborhood in Houston where our house was near Texas Southern [University, Houston, Texas] and I walked there.  And that was quite a step up from the Heights.  So there was a constant move on my parents' part to have better houses, constant moving and that's where we did--that where I grew up mostly, the later years before I left Texas Southern was in that neighborhood which is around the Third Ward, near to Yates [High School], near to Texas Southern.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up there?
Speaker 2: Well our life revolved around--sights and sounds.  I don't know, I can't remember anything so special, sights and sounds.  I was involved in Texas Southern, I was involved in high school.  I don't remember anything so special.  No, I don't--
Speaker 1: Okay, well all right.  Well you know that's a question that's just designed to elicit sensory responses and stuff.  But you, but it's okay we'll just keep going 'cause you were doing fine otherwise.
Speaker 2: Oh okay, I'm sorry--.
Speaker 1: I'm mandated to ask it in that way but in another sense--
Speaker 2: Sights and sounds--
Speaker 1: Now did you, you grew up in Houston [Texas].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And did they celebrate Juneteenth in Houston when you were coming up?
Speaker 2: Vaguely yeah, there was a celebration of Juneteenth.  I knew what it was about and you know about the news of the emancipation arriving by June 19 of what, 1865, I guess it was, right?  But I don't--my parents were not so social so certain kinds of celebrations if there was anything we initiated it.  Any kinds of celebrations or sounds, they never went to nightclubs, they never did anything like that.  My mother [Ruthester Porche Cooper] was, she, I don't think she believed--neither one of my parents were particularly strongly religious in the belief sense but my mother thought it was right and correct to be a part of a church which I happened to have liked then very, very much.  I thought it was a perfect outlet for education, for culture.
Story_ID: 31065
Speaker 1: I enjoyed teaching when I was young.  I used to teach crafts to children in the neighborhood.  A lot of them didn't like me because I was like my father [Edwin Ellis Cooper].  I insisted that they do something that's not play.  Playing was I don't know, it wasn't for me.  You go out and collect insects, you go and you take eggs from that bird's nest, but you don't play.  This is--that probably I got from my father.  There was no play in his life.  You work.
Speaker 2: Now how did you conceive of that as work though in those days?  It seems like--is there, was there a practical application to collecting insects?
Speaker 1: It was just that it was correct to do that.  It was correct to--playing for me even at a young age was silly.  It was idle.  It was not interesting.
Speaker 2: So did you consider the collecting like an extension of study?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah, I--it was an extension of study.  It was learning and I admired that and I wanted to convert every neighborhood child into one of my pupils who would go out and collect more insects.  I do remember when we lived in the Heights I used to take--my father would take us to the  farmer's market every weekend to buy stocks of fruit and apples and oranges came in boxes and there was a partition.  I figured out how you could take off one part of the partition around one side, leave the middle part and this became a chair if you get my explanation.  You got a box and then there's a partition.  You turn it up like that, then you cut off one part.  Don't forget my father had taught us how to paint and saw and do all sorts of things.  Cut off that part and then you had a little chair.  I created chairs and had my school you know where I'd invite everybody in to teach them--children my age didn't play around with me.  They either had to come to my little school or you know go someplace else.
Speaker 2: Now what gave you the idea to actually start your own little school?
Speaker 1: It's inside here.  It's inside here.  I can't do anything about it.  When we'd go to Yoakum [Texas] for these family reunions in the summers, these cousins they were some girls, one of the first cousins from one of my mother's [Ruthester Porche Cooper] sisters, that was the thing.  I'd make my lesson plans prior to leaving Houston [Texas] by car to go sit under the tree and then organize my school.  I was always the principal.  And my cousins, the girls were always my teachers in the school.  So while we were waiting for the barbecue to be finished, I was conducting the school classes under the oak tree or going on walks around my grandfather's [Joe Porche] farm.
Speaker 2: Well I--one would have to guess that school had made a tremendous impression upon you for you to replicate it everywhere you went.
Speaker 1: I think it made an impression and it, it just also--I just felt that it was inside.  I was--you probably heard people call somebody a teacher's pet.  Well you know I was the teacher's pet, always sitting on the first row, well behaved because this was the correct thing to do.  My parents said that you should do it and my, of course my father's mother [Eula Jones Cooper] you know and that's what I was.  I was usually the head of the class and never out playing football, I mean, please.
Speaker 2: So you didn't play sports at all?
Speaker 1: Absolutely not, no I had no interest in it whatsoever.  I still--I didn't have it then and I don't now.  When I go to Texas it's a big joke.  My brothers will laugh and say, what's UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles] basketball team doing or what are the [Los Angeles]Lakers doing or what--I don't know what they're doing.  I mean I know who they are and it's okay but I don't know it's just, it's not there.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you spent most of your time studying and collecting and--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --did you like to read?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, I liked to read.  Some of my teachers when I was in elementary school gave me books when I graduated from the sixth grade.  I went through school quite fast.  I graduated from high school when I was sixteen because my mother taught--we didn't, there was no compulsory kindergarten so my mother taught me how to read and write before I went to school.  So at six [years old] when I went to school I knew those things.  She borrowed a book, a 'Dick and Jane' book to read and I learned how to do that.  Learned how to not only print but write and so I stayed in the first grade for just a few weeks and was skipped immediately to the second grade, happened again in the sixth grade.  I stayed sixth grade a half year.  Teacher said oh he's good.  You know push him, let him go.  And then the eleventh grade I did a similar thing because of having extra credit so I was out of high school instead of eighteen, at sixteen.  But this you know this feeling about scholarship and being busy and doing things like that was always upper most and it was, it just, it came.  I don't think anybody pushed it.  I--if anybody was pushing it was me who was pushing it.  Nobody else was doing it.  I mean I was pushing it to the, sometimes to the disappointment of I don't know my friends around or my brothers and sometimes they would want to go do something else and I'd say no, this is silly.  Don't, you know you got to do something productive.  Or play--don't play but do something you know let's go out and collect some animals.
Story_ID: 31066
Speaker 1: Now did you have favorite radio shows or anything coming up or --?
Speaker 2: Radio show, let's see.  Of course you use the word radio, you're right because television didn't exist.  There were shows on.  But believe it or not I liked 'Amos and Andy.'  I found it extremely funny.  I didn't find it derogatory.  And to this day I only watch with intensity the food channel on television and the comedy channel.  I like to laugh a lot so Amos and--some people would be very critical of liking 'Amos and Andy', would call it derogatory.  I didn't find it--I looked forward to it whenever I could to hear it.  There were others, oh there was, I liked 'Superman.'  There was one in which, it was called 'Fibber McGee and Molly.'  Every time he entered the house he'd go to the closet and open up the closet and everything would fall out.  Let's see, 'Superman', 'Fibber McGee and Molly', 'Amos and Andy', what else?  That's all that comes to mind right now from the radio.
Speaker 1: Were there any science oriented programs on?
Speaker 2: I don't remember anything.  No.  No.  Well Super--not 'Superman,' if you can call that kind of science fiction at that time and eventually I lost interest.  You know 'Superman' went through all sorts of changes and I lost interest in 'Superman' after a while but I never lost interest in humor.  Anybody who is funny makes me laugh.  You know there are some shows on Friday night that come from New York [New York] on the Comedy channel here.  Chicago [Illinois] I think has a good comedy theater I believe that I--I've never been there to it but I know about it.  There are some here in Los Angeles [California].  But if I have nothing to do on Friday night, I like to sit and watch those funny things they say because what they're, what they are saying are some of the things that I think but I don't have the time or the inclination to go out and say it.  I'll say it to you or somebody else but you know they attack the things that are wrong with the government or wrong in our society and I like that.  I like that we can do it.  I like humor.
Speaker 1: Now you refering to the 'Bill Maher' show on Fridays?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, absolutely.  That's a must.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. (BRIEF PAUSE)
Speaker 2: Okay, now what were we talking about?  Okay, oh we were talking about--oh we were talking about school and you were holding these classes and what you were doing as a youth.  We were talking about the radio.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah we were talking about radio.
Speaker 2: And I was asking you well did you have any--the question I guess I, the big question I have is what--did you have any influences in terms of science--I mean were they all coming from school or I mean your idea of--?
Speaker 1: No.
Story_ID: 31067
Speaker 1: Did you have an idea as a, for instance in grade school what a scientist was?
Speaker 2: No.  I don't think so.  Instinctively yes, maybe I did.  But I had teachers that were, would always encourage but I don't think I had a view about who scientists were because communication wasn't like it is now.  You know with radio only and some television.  I don't know there was no, nobody to particularly--not even when I was in elementary school no what do you call, role models.  I mean role model became a late term.  You know that's not a term that I grew up with, you know.
Speaker 1: Did you know anybody over at Texas Southern [University, Houston, Texas] at that time?
Speaker 2: By the time I got to Texas Southern yeah but you--
Speaker 1: Well I'm talking about as a--
Speaker 2: At the high school?
Speaker 1: No, as an elementary school student.
Speaker 2: No.  No, no, no.  I didn't even know Texas Southern existed when I was in elementary school.
Speaker 1: Did you know of any black doctors in town or people like that?
Speaker 2: Only my, the cousin, a dentist that I told you about, he's the only one.  But then there was not a strong relation with him.  He fixed one of my teeth when I was quite young and my mother [Ruthester Porche Cooper] tried to keep a kind of contact with him.  He was a cousin of hers, maybe--also one of these Porsche descendants.  But then because of my father's [Edwin Ellis Cooper]--we didn't do a lot of things that could have been more enlightening.  But my father was, he didn't intentionally block it but he just was not, the atmosphere was not such that there was a lot of social stuff, a lot of education outreach and that going on in my house because my--this just wasn't done.  My father always was--I mean you didn't--nobody came to visit.  If we kept any relations with any relatives it was by my mother because my father was just intent, you know this intent work, work, work, work, work, work and very critical of those relatives who were better off or better educated.  He really was--
Speaker 1: So all right, now what about the movies?  Did you see--I know--
Speaker 2: I never went to a movie until I was maybe at Texas Southern when I was past twenty years old.  I never went into a movie.  No movie, no swimming pool, nothing like this because it was all segregated.  And even if it weren't segregated I--my parents were you know rather tight people, rather squeamish and afraid of certain things.  I had cousins who were parallel who did certain sorts of things but there was something that was not quite thawed all the time with my parents.  I won't say backward but just not outreaching a lot, yeah.
Story_ID: 31068
Speaker 1: So now what were race relations like when you ere growing up in Houston [Texas]?  And did you encounter the white community--?
Speaker 2: When I was in elementary school there was just no, I mean there was no exchange at all and no chance--the way that we lived there was no opportunity for it to be good or bad.  I mean just didn't--I mean we, it wasn't discussed or anything when I was quite small.  It wasn't discussed, it wasn't--didn't come up until I was in, probably in high school because we moved, when I went to Yates [High School] we moved into the neighborhood that was formerly Jewish and our neighbors were, immediate neighbors were Jewish on both sides of our house.  And the house was a very correct, middle class house, one story different from that two story house that my father [Edwin Ellis Cooper] built but in a better neighborhood because my mother [Ruthester Porche Cooper] was always saying oh we need to go someplace where there's better schools, better schools where they can continue to walk to school.  And then by the time we came to Yates or when I went to Yates, we were near enough to Texas Southern so we were right in the middle of Texas Southern.  There was a well known church there and high school so that was ideal.  But even then, even despite the fact that our neighbors were Jewish, there was no problem with us and them and though they eventually moved away which is what happened to that whole neighborhood.  All the whites who were there left after a while and the neighborhood underwent a kind of decay which is what's happened to it now.  There are some, still some respectable looking homes now but we don't own our house anymore.  My siblings and I sold the house to get my mother out of it to put her into a place where she could be taken care of which is what we did and it didn't work cause she was too unhappy there.  So race relations, there was nothing that we encountered at all actually.
Speaker 1: Well did you have a sense of identity as a colored person or a negro growing up or--?
Speaker 2: Not a lot.  I was just a person, not a lot of because it wasn't talked about in my house.  My parents never drummed that oh look at the way you look or (makes sound)--this was never talked about and not that they felt self-conscious about it.  I know that when we visited my--our physician was white and I remember when my mother would go for exams or whatever, I mean we'd have to go around to the back door.  But I remember doing that but I didn't think it was--my parents said well we have to do this but they never said why and I never questioned it.  I never questioned any of this until I went where?  I guess until I went to Atlanta University [Atlanta, Georgia] and then I started to question these relations and that was (mumbling) '59 [1959], '60 [1960], '59 [1959], I think.
Story_ID: 31069
Speaker 1: Okay, well let's, let me go on and just ask you about science in terms of school.  When did you have your first--did you have any science courses per se in, or what was your first science course in school?
Speaker 2: First science courses.  First science courses, let's see.   At high school at Yates [High School] I had science courses but I remember more strongly my science at Texas Southern [University, Houston, Texas].  I had two, three superb, I would call them mentors, people I started to--I guess that's when I--
Speaker 1: Well I don't want to get you there yet.
Speaker 2: Oh okay, all right high school.
Speaker 1: I want to get through high school first you know (unclear) first start, what your first, your (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah in high school, let me try to quickly go back.  Who taught--high school--
Speaker 1: Did you have biology in high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I learned to like biology in high school and I didn't want much to do with chemistry or physics or mathematics.  I didn't, I wasn't very comfortable with it. I wasn't good at it.  Even till this day I'm not good at it.  I shy away from that which is too much physics, too much chemistry.  Biology, I'm trying to--nothing is coming to mind.  It continues to come to my mind--who taught me biology in high school?  Texas Southern sticks in my mind more and that was--
Speaker 1: Okay, well let me ask you this though--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in high school then I mean were you thinking about becoming a scientist at all in high school or did you have a concept of that?
Speaker 2: Probably.  Probably I was.  I wanted to be, I wanted to teach, that was always upper most.  And I've always been studious, academic or--I was the highest ranking boy in my class, high school class.  There were six girls ahead of me and I was voted the most scholarly boy in the class because I was the first boy.  There was 250 in that class from Yates, in high school.  But I can't remember, I'm having a block on the science from high school.  I just knew that I wanted to teach but I can't remember science so much from high school.
Speaker 1: Now did you have a--what did you think, what did you imagine yourself as a teacher of when you, you know as a profession?  Were you going to teach literature or history, political science?
Speaker 2: Well it certainly was not revolving around any social science.  Now, it's coming, something is coming to me but again it's not--oh gosh.
Speaker 1: (BRIEF PAUSE)
Speaker 2: I developed a strong--and now something is coming to me.  I developed a strong interest in art in high school through the influence of two teachers, two art teachers.  I won a major prize in ceramics when I was fourteen.  The ceramic vase was sent to the Carnegie Art Institute in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] for a national contest.  I didn't win there but I won--the next year I won a second prize in the same and this was a citywide contest for high school students and I entered it.  My teachers encouraged me to enter that vase in the contest and the vase won a first prize.  So I was fourteen, fifteen and I remember coming home telling my parents that I was going to study art.  And till this date, art still stays.  But my parents said, put their foot down and said no you won't because you will never make a living as an artist.
Story_ID: 31070
Speaker 1: Okay.  We were just remarking off camera about the correlation between art and science.  A lot of scientists can be artists or musicians too or have a--
Speaker 2: Well what happened to me, my parents [Edwin Ellis Cooper and Ruthester Porche Cooper] put their foot down and said no you cannot make a living as an artist.  Why don't you study biology since you're good at biology?  And so I was, I had my own mind when I was growing up as you probably have--but I was also extremely obedient.  And I said okay, fine I will study biology because that wasn't the time when you rebelled and I was not a rebellious type.  I had my own agenda but I didn't have to broadcast it to upset my parents.  And so I entered Texas Southern [University, Houston, Texas] when I was sixteen, yeah sixteen.  The art stayed with me but then I became really excited about biology there and I--
Speaker 1: Just one question though about Texas Southern [sic, Yates High School].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Were there the names of any special teachers at--I mean at Jack Yates [High School], any special teachers or mentors there that really took a special interest--?
Speaker 2: I cannot come up with any science.  I still am blocked with that.  I do remember is if they're standing here now these two art teachers--
Speaker 1: Okay, well what were they names?
Speaker 2: Mrs., there was a Mrs. Thomas and Mrs. Sands.  And I remember in the art class with Mrs. Thomas, I took a big piece of clay and I pounded it down one side, another side.  She looked at it and she said this is very interesting.  Let's make a plaster of paris cast out of it.  So I made a plaster of paris cast.  We--you poured the liquid clay into it and then you removed the cast because it was bifurcated so you could take the cast off and then you had your vase there.  And then you put it in the kiln, fire it, glaze it and fire it and I did three of them.  And I have the original that won the prize still.  That was 1950, I think '50 [1950], something like that.  And I have one copy of it and I lost the other one from some place.  And then I have some paintings that I did.  One of them has been framed and I have that hanging.  Then later on--and well maybe we'll come back to it but I don't want to forget it.  I studied art when I was here at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles] because at one period I was working extremely hard and felt like I was really on the verge of a breakdown and I thought that I had to do something to get out of this intense work that it takes to maintain yourself in a university like UCLA.  So I studied art again at night and managed to not have a breakdown.  But the art--I cannot remember any science from high school, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Story_ID: 31071
Speaker 1: Well Texas Southern [University, Houston, Texas], was there any question about whether you were going to Texas Southern or some other school?
Speaker 2: It had to be Texas Southern because my parents couldn't afford anything else.  It was not what I wanted because my sights were much higher and much bigger than--nothing wrong.  I have no--nothing wrong with my education at Texas Southern.  I'm happy about it, proud about it.  I had a great time while I was there but I felt like I wanted to go Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] or someplace like that.
Speaker 1: That--
Speaker 2: But that was a dream that I really had and eventually I did go to an Ivy League university for my Ph.D.
Speaker 1: Right, so did you live at home when you--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you--
Speaker 2: Just walked straight up my street right into the campus.
Speaker 1: Now who was the president of Texas Southern in those days?
Speaker 2: The first president when I first went there was [Ralphael O'Hara] Lanier, the last name, L-A-N-I-E-R, but the second president was Nabrit.  S. Milton Nabrit who I really admired an awful lot and who got to know me.  Nabrit came from Atlanta University [Atlanta, Georgia] where he had been president and he received his Ph.D. from Brown University [Providence, Rhode Island] where I received mine about 1933, Nabrit came.  I also met the chairman because I excelled in biology when I was at Texas Southern and I got to know the chairman who was Robert Terry.  The library is named for him at Texas Southern.  He was once one of the later presidents long after I left and he considered me one of his prize pupils in biology.  So I was quite close to Terry and quite close to Nabrit.  And Nabrit said to me, I think that you need to go to graduate school and I would like to have you go to graduate school at Atlanta University.  Well I had never really heard of Atlanta University so I said fine.  So he got me some, arranged so that I got a scholarship to Atlanta University I think for five hundred dollars and I, off I went to Atlanta.  And came, I don't know if I'm getting ahead but I don't want to forget it, came under the wing of his former student, a woman who was the chair of the department of biology at Atlanta University who was a graduate of Radcliffe [College] Harvard [Cambridge, Massachusetts] and a student of Nabrit.  Her name was Mary Reddick, R-E-D-D-I-C-K.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah we were at Atlanta U a couple of weeks ago.
Speaker 2: Who did you see there?
Speaker 1: Yeah, well J.K. Haynes and Dr. Hall--
Speaker 2: That--how old are they?
Speaker 1: They're younger than you.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I left Atlanta when I--'53, [1953], '57 [1957], '59 [1959].
Speaker 1: But the building we did the interviews in was Nabrit-McBay--
Speaker 2: Chemistry building.
Speaker 1: Yeah, chemistry building.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Names were Nabrit, the same Nabrit that right, wasn't it the same (unclear)?
Speaker 2: McBay was the professor of chemistry when I was there.
Speaker 1: Yes, Henry McBay.
Speaker 2: Nabrit was already, had left there to become president of Texas Southern.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: But really that was a very, very revered family in Atlanta.  His brother was also president of Howard [University, Washington D.C.], James--
Speaker 1: James Nabrit, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was the president of Howard University.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Then he had a sister, I mean they were an illustrious family, very, very important family.  And Mary Reddick was his student when she was getting her master's at Atlanta University and she went on to Radcliffe.  I have to tell you a little anecdote about--well I had learned, I got really excited about biology when I was at Texas Southern.  My parents said no art but biology.  So then I went on to Atlanta and it was time to decide on a Masters thesis.  Well I was filled with a lot of enthusiasm and I thought in order to do research you had to have lots of ideas.  Well I had a lot of ideas about what I wanted to do for a thesis never knowing, not having done any research how difficult it is to focus on one particular subject and then expand.  You don't throw a whole list of subjects, you focus on one and then expand from it.  So I remember walking into her office and she's an interesting lady, a complicated lady, chain smoker, smoked Lucky Strikes but really very bright person and troubled and I won't get into that.  But I went into her office and I said oh, Dr. Reddick and I had a long list, I'll never forget it.  A long list of research ideas that I wanted to do for my master's thesis with her.  She took one look at the list, she took one more Lucky Strike out and started to smoke it.  And she said, "Mr. Cooper you're not going to do this.  You're going to do this problem" and then she tore my list up into small pieces of paper and threw it in the trash can which crushed me.  I thought my god what has happened to me now that I've disappointed this powerful lady?  She doesn't want to listen to my ideas.  She said "no you're going to do this."  Well what was it, it was essentially a repeat of her Ph.D. thesis from Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] which was fine.  And I really liked the problem I plunged into it immediately and graduated on time.  She was happy and proud and I was too.  But that's how I really got myself launched on biology research.  I saw some other things at Texas Southern but again with the high school I cannot remember.  I can't remember.  The art sticks out in my mind.  I can't remember biology teachers at the moment.
Story_ID: 31072
Speaker 1: Well who are the biology teachers at--
Speaker 2: At Yates [High School].
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know but who are the biology teachers at Texas Southern [University, Houston Texas]?
Speaker 2: [Robert J.] Terry who later became the president.  The library I think there now is named for him.  Then there was a woman, Alberta Seaton who was pretty well known.  She was I think, maybe her husband I think was--were originally from one of the islands in the Caribbean I think but I can't remember.  I got interested in development and embryology by studying with her, she was quite an astute person.  She was a professor of biology there.  I do remember in the embryology class opening a chick egg that had been incubated for forty-eight hours and I opened it up and looked in and I saw blood cir--the heart pulsating and blood circulation.  I became so excited about this I dropped everything, ran to her office and I said Dr. Seaton, the heart is beating which she literally--her response was a little crushing cause she said yes, yes I know, was her response.  I thought she should have been as excited as I was to see the heart of a chick embryo beating, but she wasn't.  So--but I didn't let that stop me.  I--that really probably set me on the course of this interest in development where the embryological development or evolutionary development, I'm always interested in how something primitive becomes something advanced.  And it goes over into other areas and (unclear).
Speaker 1: What's the name of the study of that--?
Speaker 2: Development.  In general, it's development.  You can have ontogenetic development which is embryology or you can have phylogenetic development which is evolution.  And so I'm interested in both, more in evolution of functions, evolution of immune system than ontogeny which is the development.  But I really got you know turned onto it then which plummeted, which sent me on to Brown [University, Providence, Rhode Island] and also on to, well more during that period.  But the art stayed with me but the art started in high school, junior high school, high school.  And then biology came a little later.  And to this day I say to myself, my parents [Edwin Ellis Cooper and Ruthester Porche Cooper] were right, I wouldn't want to struggle in the art market now.  I mean I, if--who knows, maybe I would have been good enough.  Maybe I could have been famous, I don't know but I never gave it a chance.  I never was willing.  That practical aspect you know go and do what you can do successfully and my parents said it and I said okay they're right.  And to this day now I say that I can still, I still made a career out of my science but then I've never lost this appreciation for art and can still do it.  I have a lot of the pieces of ceramics that I did still now.  I like going to museums.  I like following artists, whoever they are and also music too, but more with art.  Music, I also dabbled a bit with that (unclear).
Speaker 1: Oh, what did you play an instrument?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I studied--my mother [Ruthester Porche Cooper] had a piano that she took from Yoakum [Texas] her piano, took it to Houston [Texas] and stacks of books she studied on her own piano.  And I decided that I wanted to do the same.  So I taught myself piano through about third grade of piano just plucking away on the keys.  I also got interested in the organ because I--the fascinating of playing with your feet and four manuals so I, while I was quite active in the church in the Third Ward which was another chance to teach and--I started to take organ lessons with a little bit of piano that I knew and studied that for about two years and then dropped that.  Went to work in Mexico, learned folk guitar there but I don't do that much anymore.  I know how to do it but I don't, I'm not interested in it at the moment.
Story_ID: 31073
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I guess we should just go and pick you up at Atlanta University [Atlanta, Georgia].  Now did any of your collection of materials as a child, was that beneficial at all when you started going into biology?
Speaker 2: Collections, you mean the animal collection?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah your animals and the insect collection--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: -- that kind of help?
Speaker 2: Sure.  I mean I think it--especially these ideas about development, development of that chick embryo episode that I had at Texas Southern [University, Houston, Texas] was strong.  And then my master's thesis at--I should tell you about my master's thesis from Atlanta University cause that was interesting.  Mary Reddick said no you're not going to do these problems.  That's too much and tore up the paper and threw it in the trash and then said you're going to do this which was her, a copy of her thesis, her Ph.D. thesis and here's what it was.  This was really fascinating 'cause it took me back to the embryo that I saw at Texas Southern.  I took the otocyst which is the primitive era in forty-eight hour chick embryos, you had to do everything under the microscope.  The otocyst is a round sack of cells that will become the ear.  So I had to learn how to cut it out under the microscope and then transfer it under sterile conditions to another embryo that was a little bit older that had one of the membranes that are associated with development called the chorioallantoic membrane and it had a lot, it has a lot of blood vessels in it.  It's still in some assay systems.  So I had to take the primitive ear, a little round ball of cells, put it on that under sterile conditions, close up the hole with wax, turn it over so that it would adhere to the chor--this membrane, acquire blood circulation and then continue its development as if it were in its original location in the embryo.  Come back, I think it was seven days later and then cross my fingers, wait to open up the egg to see if it had finished its development and to my surprise it had.  My master's thesis, I've got it over there now that showed semi-circular canals which are involved in our-- Chicks have a similar ear to humans.  Semi-circular canals, there was the acoustic nerve that had developed and the auditory nerve had developed.  All of that was in place.  I was so excited to see that starting from a tiny little thing, little round sack to these bones that had grown in culture and that was my master's thesis which was a typical thesis in embryology or development and which was my, we call them then major professor (unclear) she put me onto that and I learned then that you got to focus.  You got to do one thing well and not have one thousand different ideas.  So then when I went to Brown University [Providence, Rhode Island]--
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.
Story_ID: 31074
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about one thing first before you jump to there.  Now when did you go to Woods Hole [Marine Biological Laboratory, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Ah, you see that on there!
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Did you go to Woods Hole before Atlanta University [Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: No I went to Woods Hole after Atlanta University?
Speaker 1: After, that's (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --thought some reason it was before this interview.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  No, no, no I went to--
Speaker 1: So let me go back again and so now what year did you graduate from Texas Southern?
Speaker 2: '57 [1957].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So all right.
Speaker 2: '57 [1957].
Speaker 1: And what year did you earn your masters degree from--?
Speaker 2: '59 [1959].
Speaker 1: '59 [1959], all right.
Speaker 2: '59 [1959] from Atlanta University.
Speaker 1: So you went to Woods Hole was it in '59 [1959] or '60 [1960]?
Speaker 2: No it was, must have been--no it was '50 [1950]--it was while I was at Atlanta University as I recall.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it might be '58 [1958]?
Speaker 2: '50 [1950], '53 [1953] to '57 [1957] -- '58 I was a student at Woods Hole.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  We got it right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, '58 [1958] I was a student at Woods Hole.
Speaker 1: Well before we get you out of Atlanta University, let's talk about that experience.  What--
Speaker 2: Fantastic experience.  I thoroughly enjoyed--
Speaker 1: Explain what it is and what happened.
Speaker 2: Well Atlanta [Georgia] was such a--the city was a much more enjoyable place than living in Houston [Texas].  Also I was away from the influence of my parents [Edwin Ellis Cooper and Ruthester Porche Cooper] which in some respects was too confining.  I wanted to-if I felt like staying out all night I wanted to be able to do that and I couldn't do that and not have problems with my parents.  So I never did it at all when I went to Atlanta but I could do it if I wanted to do it.  So that was important.  Also I just loved the environment of Morehouse [College] and Spelman [College] and Atlanta.  I mean this was--you know coming from Texas Southern [University, Houston, Texas] this was really a step up.  Nothing was wrong with Texas Southern but this was you know a brand new state school and then there was all this you know history and involvement of all groups and all racial groups down in Atlanta.  I mean this was something at Morehouse and Spellman that I just had never experienced at Texas Southern.  And Houston was just a, sometimes a little--if I didn't reach out it was a little dull.  But I--it was all right.  I, you know there was art, there was culture or whatever but it was not like Atlanta.  So I thoroughly enjoyed being there.  The science, people who had been there like Nabrit and at Spelman.  I had a good parasitology professor at Spelman because they shared faculty and he was Barnett Smith who was a parasitologist.  I liked him very much.  John Hope Burney taught me physiology.  Fredrick Mapp also taught me, and of course Mary Reddick taught me embryology.  She was the person I did my thesis with and she was a student of Nabrit's.  And some--I've forgotten the exact connection now but he decided I should go to Brown University [Providence, Rhode Island] because he went to Brown University.  He got me to go to Atlanta so he was a strong influence from Texas Southern to Atlanta and then Atlanta to Brown.  And at Brown I learned prior to coming there I had learned how to focus.  I found a major, I don't know if I'm jumping the gun now but I found a--
Story_ID: 31075
Speaker 1: Well sort of cause I wanted you talk about Woods Hole [Marine Biological Laboratory, Massachusetts] before we get to Brown [University, Providence, Rhode Island].
Speaker 2: Okay, another fantastic experience.  Another fantastic experience.
Speaker 1: Were certain students selected to go to Woods Hole for the summer?  Did you have to apply or--?
Speaker 2: You had to apply and you--it was highly competitive.  And Woods Hole was considered to be the "Harvard by the Sea."  It still is considered that.  It's a very, very prestigious place to go.
Speaker 1: This is the Woods Hole, Massachusetts--?
Speaker 2: Marine, yeah it's Marine Biological Laboratory.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: And any biologist who considers them or who considers themselves an up and coming biologist had to spend at least one summer at Woods Hole and I got that chance.  I thought it was just, I mean it was just incredible.  And I got into an invertebrate zoology course and I was interested in invertebrates, you know marine animals and this was just incredible.  Stories about, are supposed to be done about my being there too some time in the future.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Yeah I don't know when it's going to happen but--
Speaker 1: Are there any stories associated with you being there that you can share with us?
Speaker 2: No, none, none especially.  I met my future roommate who was orthodox Jewish there who was in my class.  But anyway, what do I want to tell you about Woods Hole?  Woods Hole was even kind of an extension of that atmosphere in, at Atlanta [University], Morehouse [College], Spellman [College] [Atlanta, Georgia], more of this New England feeling, the buildings, the history behind the place and to remember that Nabrit had been there.  I think [John] Burney was also a student at Woods Hole as well.  Burney was at Morehouse, the chairman of the biology department at Morehouse.  Anyway the--so I spent a summer at Woods Hole in invertebrate zoology when I was what, all of what twenty-one years old, twenty-one, twenty-two, something--twenty-one maybe.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And then came back to Atlanta University [Atlanta, Georgia], finished up and then applied to Brown.  Oh, going to Woods Hole, I didn't have enough money saved up so one of my brothers loaned me $250.00 I think to get to, help me go there and that was a nice thing and a big thing to me.  I didn't dare ask my parents [Edwin Ellis Cooper and Ruthester Porche Cooper] for it because well--so I got to Woods Hole.  I still have my drawings from the class, my picture from the class.  What else?  Most of the professors who taught me in that class, they're probably all dead now.  I mean they were thirty years older than I was then and I was only in my early twenties.  So then after Woods Hole and yeah and Atlanta University, I went on to Brown in 1950, '59 [1959] and stayed there until '62 [1962] and then I came here.
Story_ID: 31076
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now it says here that someone, one of your professors instructed you that if you asked the correct questions of mother nature then you will get answers--oh, you will get answers only if you ask--
Speaker 2: The right questions.
Speaker 1: --the right questions, right.
Speaker 2: And you want to know who that was, yeah.  I remember that.  He was Mac Edds [Mack V. Edds].  He was a professor of biology at Brown University [Providence, Rhode Island].  And he told me that because the problem that I wanted to work on was to study regeneration in salamanders.  If you cut the limb off of a salamander it will regenerate that limb.  But before doing so, the wound has to heal.  When the wound heals there gathers stem cells inside, a ball of cells that are around where the wound heals and that mound of cells is called a blastema.  It's just undifferentiated, uncommitted cells but they eventually will become the new little fingers, the skin, the skin glands and everything of the new limb.  Well I had the idea when I left--see this idea of stem cell development started in Atlanta and when I got to Brown I didn't walk in to say to my chosen mentor here's twenty ideas, I had one idea.  I learned my lesson from Mary Reddick at Atlanta University [Atlanta, Georgia], don't go in with twenty ideas.  Find one idea and then do that.  Well the idea I came up with was to cut off that part with the stem cells, put those in tissue culture to see if I could get a little limb formed in tissue culture.  I found the man with whom I wanted to work immediately going to Brown and I walked into his office.  I said this is what I want to do.  He said oh, brilliant idea, let's do it.  So that's what I started out doing as my first attempt at a Ph.D. thesis.  At the same time I was studying--now we're at Brown now.  I'm out of Atlanta.
Speaker 1: You're okay, you're all right.
Speaker 2: And then at the same time I began studying for the foreign languages because two languages were required for the Ph.D. then, not now anywhere anymore.  So, I studied--I had studied some Spanish in high school [Yates High School] but then I studied French and then I took the second language in German.  I hired an Austrian lady to tutor me in German while I was in Atlanta and to some extent when I went on to Brown to tutor me in German so I could take the two language exams immediately.  Well I did take the two language exams, passed them and was given an unprecedented early oral exam for the Ph.D., which qualified me to go further in the Ph.D. early on, more--usually people take longer but because I passed my language right away then I got to go.  Well the thesis that I chose or the idea of growing this blastema and culture, I would have just enough success to keep me going.  But in the meantime my major professor there was not happy with my progress, not me but it was a difficult problem to do.  I didn't realize how difficult it was primarily because when you put something in culture it has to be sterile and if it's not sterile, bacteria will take over and the whole experiment is destroyed.  And that's what happened in many of my cultures was that they were full of bacteria.  Well he took me off after the first year he took me to another marine lab in Maine, pretty famous but not like Woods Hole [Marine Biological Laboratory, Massachusetts] to help him-
Story_ID: 31077
Speaker 1: All right, now.
Speaker 2: There was a tiny, it's a tiny village and there's a marine lab and I went there [Marine Laboratory at Salisbury Cove, Maine] to help my major professor [Richard J.] Goss do his summer research which was transplanting scales in fish and looking at their immune response and trying to prevent the immune response in fish and I started to help him.  I would do the experiments.  One day he walked into the lab and he said to me when you get back to Brown [University, Providence, Rhode Island] in the fall he said I want you to stop that problem of taking the regeneration blastema and putting it in culture he said because I don't want you here for the rest of your life.  It's too difficult.  Meanwhile I headed, I could go to meetings and I would tell some of the greats in developmental biology what I was doing and they said oh, this is fantastic and it really was a revolutionary idea.  It has since been done but I didn't do it and I--when he told me in the lab I nearly fainted because it was one of the first times that somebody high, you know a mentor or somebody--it was actually the second time.  Mary Reddick did it a lot about my ideas.  But this Ph.D. problem really when he said that I had to--I felt like I was going to faint right in the lab.  It was really a big disappointment because I had worked on it for a full year and was getting some encouraging results and thought that I was really on the way to make a, making a breakthrough with this and it didn't work.   So I went back to Brown that fall, started to do the experiments transplanting scales and fish and giving them immunosuppressive drugs which is what we give patients to accept kidney grafts.  They have to stay on immunosuppression.  Or you probably read about this woman that got the hand transplant here at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles]?
Speaker 1: Right, that's right.
Speaker 2: She's on immunosuppression for the rest of her life.  Well I used some of the same drugs to show that fish also need, if you're going to give them a transplant, they need immunosuppressive drugs too.  But the importance was that this is an evolutionary development.  This is not anything peculiar to humans rejecting grafts.  All animals reject grafts so it contributed to the concept of graft rejection or cell--not cell--
Speaker 1: Isn't there a percentage of, I mean of acceptance or I mean--I think when the woman was on television they said that so many per--such and such percent of human being, of transplants--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --are rejected which is like most of them or almost, like most of them are.  And, but there is a percentage that--
Speaker 2: Are accepted?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: They accept it for a short time but there is only one instance in nature where you can have a total acceptance without a problem and that's in identical twins.  Identical twins because they come from the same egg and sperm and so they are for all intents and purposes the same person, the same individual.  But anybody else, your mo--you can find somebody I don't know where that might be a better donor than your mother or your father.  These--that's just the way the genes have distributed in the population.  It need not be an immediate relative.  It can be somebody else.  So that's what I did.  I finished that problem in one year doing what I was doing and these same drugs are used also in anti-cancer therapy.  Got my thesis done and finished it up.  In the meantime that opened up another area for me sticking with this idea of development but it opened up another area and that's immunology because I never knew anything about immunology.  And immunology was not really what it is, then or now, it just, it didn't start to bloom until I got into the field.  Not that--and I helped to build a certain branch of immunology and that is this evolution or comparative immunology.  I'm considered you know a founder of this discipline that looks at immune responses in all animal groups.  So I was at a crossroads when it was time to leave Brown to further my education and that was, what do I do?  Shall I go back to what I had gotten excited about in Atlanta [University, Atlanta, Georgia]?  Shall I got back to what I had gotten excited about at Brown, you know taking these embryonic structures--?   And I said no, why don't I continue with the developmental or the evolutionary idea but get into immunology.  And I thought okay you're a zoologist so why don't you marry zoology with immunology and call it comparative immunology like you do with comparative religion or comparative literature.  All these comparative--look at--so I decided then that that was going to be my major contribution.  So I came here, found someone who would take me on as a post-doc and I came here [University of California, Los Angeles] in '62 [1962] of October.
Speaker 1: So did you kind of coin that expression comparative immunology?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was the first to use that.
Speaker 1: You were the first comparative immunologist.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I wrote the textbook, the definitive text for that.  I organized societies in Italy and in Japan just devoted to the subject, an international group.  If you Google comparative immunology you'll see my name will pop up.  I thought this was an interesting way to do it and then it took a lot of work but work I enjoyed because it was more of what, of that talent that I had for teaching and pulling people into my idea you know like I used to do when I was quite young as a child.  One professor here with whom I helped organize a symposium here at UCLA, she was in my department, much, much older than I, she said to me that I had the Midas touch.  She said everything you touch turns to gold.  And no one had ever told me that but I'll never forget that because I made a--I showed her how she could organize this symposium and make something out of it.  Anyway, where were we now, back to coming here.
Story_ID: 31078
Speaker 1: Okay, UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles] now.
Speaker 2: UCLA, I started in '62 [1962] and never (unclear)--
Speaker 1: You have a post-doctoral fellowship.
Speaker 2: Post-doctoral fellowship.  I wrote a proposal to the National Cancer Institute to get a nice round salary of $5,000.00 for my first year and was so excited after six months I wrote another proposal and got a second year for $5,500.00 for '63 [1963].  In the meantime, I was offered my present position about three months after I came to UCLA by the chairman of the Department of Anatomy.  I didn't know what was happening.  I didn't know--and this was the furthest thing from my mind coming to a medical school, becoming a part of a faculty.  I was a product of Texas Southern [University, Houston, Texas].  I was a product of Atlanta [University, Atlanta, Georgia], product of Brown [University, Providence, Rhode Island].  Atlanta and Brown more my own sort of feeling you know these small historical colleges.  Now this is where I thought well you got to back to one of those places.  Not so much because of any racial considerations because I had--I did a lot of analysis with people like [Samuel Milton] Nabrit and [Robert] Terry in Texas before I took a job.  They said look you do what you like, that's your life.  You go where you want.  You can do what you want.  And so I kept that upper most.  So here at--I was offered this position in the Department of Anatomy and I said to the chairman, me teach in an anatomy department in a medical school?  I said no I don't want the job.  I turned it down several times to stay as a post-doc with that, pushing that new discipline of comparative immunology.  And they persisted because here were the reasons, the ultimate reasons.  The dental school at UCLA opened in '64 [1964].  Also this department was famous in neurology.  It was called an anatomy department but they needed two people in all the basic science departments to teach medical students basic science.  And so they wanted to hire me to help them teach the new dental class because they didn't have any basic science faculty, two people in my department, two from biochemistry, physiology.  So that was the, that was the projected goal.  That was not what I was told.  We just want you in the department because you're interested in immunology.  The department was steeped in neurology and they wanted to open up immunology so they hired an immunochemist and me in '64 [1964].  I finally succumbed to their invitations and became an assistant professor in '64 [1964].
Speaker 1: Now what did Jane Oppenheimer have to do with you coming here?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she didn't have anything to do with me coming here but she was a very well known professor at Washington University.  She used to come to Brown every summer to write.  And I met her one day in the library and I told her about my idea of linking immunology and development together and that I had done work on transplantation in fish.  And she put me on to a paper, I don't remember now where it was published but somebody had looked at the thymus gland which is a gland that we have and chickens and frogs and all animals have a thymus gland.  I wanted to take out that gland in fish or in frog larvae and show that I could prevent their immune response from developing as people were beginning to do for mice at that time in the early 60s [1960s] because immunology was really infantile in the early 60s [1960s] when I started.  As a result, somebody like me who was trying to push earthworm graft rejection and thymus development in frog larvae was considered crazy.  I was called a rebel and insane and stupid or not stupid but nobody believed what I was saying.  And I said look, I'm a biologist.  There is no reason why an earthworm or a frog cannot have an immune system just like we do.  But immunology at that time was anthropocentric.  It was oriented toward human immunology and if you were going to work on an animal model it had to be a mouse.  Heaven forbid you would go near any other animal other than a mouse.  And I didn't want anything to do with mice.  You know I started out at six years old with my frogs and my crayfish and worms and it--
Speaker 1: What was the advantage of using amphibians and worms and--?
Speaker 2: No advantage except that I wanted to show that they could do the same thing that humans could do as a biological question.  There was no advantage to it.  I ultimately showed and people have realized in other disciplines as well that you need animal models and animal models need not be mice or mammals like us.  Look at all the work that's been done on drosophila, the fruit fly.  All of our genetics, I shouldn't say all of it but a good deal of it has come from looking at flies.  There's a primitive worm, much more primitive than my earthworms called C. elegans, an enormous amount of work has been done.  There are several Nobel Prizes that have been awarded for work on C. elegans which is a very primitive worm and drosophila.  So some people do realize the importance of having a more global view of reactions or responses or mechanisms and you can only do that if you get out of the human system and look at some primitive systems.  It's not always easy either to have, to look at reactions or responses in humans.  It's tough to do clinical analyses so we need some animal models.  We've got animal models for Alzheimer's, animal models for obesity, much simpler to analyze than trying to do it all on humans because of lack of so much ethical considerations.
Story_ID: 31079
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so well just, by the way you earned your Ph.D. in '63 [1963] right, from Brown [University, Providence Rhode Island].
Speaker 2: Right.  I was late submitting the thesis, that's why I was awarded it but I was finished in '62 [1962].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And I have to tell you a little, quick little thing about that.  I missed my--I loved ceremonies you know as a child I loved ceremonies.  And I missed--you'll see my picture of my master's degree in here.  I didn't go to the Ph.D. ceremony at Brown University [Providence, Rhode Island] which is really quite something because the degree is awarded in Latin and it's very impressive.  I didn't go.  I came immediately to Los Angeles [California] in the fall of '62 [1962], missed the commencement of '62 [1962] and didn't come back in '63 [1963] for it.  But I was, twenty-five years later I was awarded an honorary degree from Brown so I got to participate in the whole ceremony after twenty-five years of graduating from there as the tribute to a scientist who had done well from Brown in 1988, I think it was.  So I got my ceremony at Brown away twenty-five years later.
Speaker 1: Now did your parents [Edwin Ellis Cooper and Ruthester Porche Cooper] have a chance to see you get your master's degree or--?
Speaker 2: My mother [Ruthester Porche Cooper] went to my ceremony for the master's but not for the Ph.D., she did for the Masters, my father [Edwin Ellis Cooper] didn't.  I guess he was working but my mother did.
Speaker 1: Now what did they make of that?  You said your mother's family had lots of, she had educated sisters.
Speaker 2: Oh she was quite proud.  She was quite proud of it.  She somehow engineered--I kept up contact with [Robert] Terry at Texas Southern [University, Houston, Texas] and I was invited back for, I got an honorary degree from Texas Southern also, I forget what year.  Maybe it was back to back with that Brown one somehow.  But I went--so I had to give a major lecture and so the entire family was there for that.  And then maybe for somebody else's graduation I was--a high school graduation I was asked to go back.  I mean they were quite, always proud but never fully a part of it and maybe the same with my siblings too.  My siblings all went to college but nobody ever went as far as I have gone.  My brother next [Joe A. Cooper] to me is--he's managed a department store in a very poor neighborhood, Jewish owned department store for fifty years, you know quite happy doing that.  The next brother [Phillip R. Cooper] is a retired military person, went to Howard University [Washington D.C.] and then one sister was quite--rose to be quite high in--as a cancer therapy nurse at MD Anderson [Cancer Center] in Houston [Texas] but has since retired.  But I'm the only one who's had this strong fervor, you know this academic never wanting to stop and--
Story_ID: 31080
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well tell us about UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles] now.  Here you are and how did you get to California?
Speaker 2: (Unclear). (BRIEF PAUSE)
Speaker 1: But California yeah, well I didn't want this.  I told you I didn't particularly want this position but I accepted it and plunged right into teaching professional students which was very, very different for me.  I was used to teaching science--not science but most specifically biology students.  And teaching biology students or teaching students to become Ph.D. candidates is very different from teaching medical students or dental students.  And to be perfectly honest I didn't like it at first.  But I stuck with it and continued to perfect my research program, getting grants and starting travel and I had a functioning lab with a lot of people at--from different countries all the time until the funds started to dwindle.  And the funds started to dwindle for me like they did for everybody for basic science research.  It's just awful now.  I'm glad I don't have to do it anymore.  I've made my mark and I don't need to compete for grant proposals.  I don't even want to do it.  I didn't especially enjoy it then because it's very difficult when the administration and National Institutes of Health [NIH], when they don't have money and you send in perfect proposals they find all sorts of things wrong with the proposals so that you can--so that they can reject your grant 'cause they don't have the money.  I remember almost telling one official at NIH, he said well tell me what can we do for you?  I said well what you can do for me is give me the funds that I've requested.  That's what I need.  I don't need any perfunctory gestures of benevolence.  I want the money the run my lab.  Well the funds eventually dried up and I had to close my lab.  I taught a lot of undergraduates.  I still teach undergraduates but I don't have a lab anymore.
Speaker 2: So how long was it before they-- your lab?  How, what kind of run did you have from 1964 to--?
Speaker 1: I had one from '62 [1962] which was, '62 [1962] up until about oh well into the '80s [1980s] and '90s [1990s] with people coming from everywhere wanting to--where I had a lab as big as--you know two secretaries and students and post-docs from--I went through various periods.  Post-docs from the Middle East, two of my best students were from Egypt, a husband and wife team.  And two post-docs from Spain and from Germany, Italy, I mean from everywhere.
Story_ID: 31081
Speaker 1: Okay, now I want to go--we want to try to go year by year and talk about what happened but in '64 [1964], so in '66 [1966] it says here that you went to Mexico.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you do a year there?
Speaker 2: Almost a year.  What happened was that the vice chancellor for external affairs of the university asked the chairman of my department sort of permission.  He, we met somewhere and he was, liked me and what.  And we had, UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles] had a program for the Agency of [sic, for] International Development in Mexico which meant an exchange, it facilitated an exchange between professors at UCLA and Mexican universities.  So my chairman who hired me in '64 [1964] said, well why don't you go to Mexico?  I'd like for you to go there.  And I said oh that would be exciting.   So I accepted it.  It was funded by the Agency for International Development.  I drove down from here to Mexico City [Mexico], found an apartment and then while there actually discovered that I was not happy because Mexico is a very different culture from the United States and I thought either I'm going to have to use my ingenuity to get with it or you're going to have to go back to California.  So I said well why don't I study Spanish?  I had already had Spanish in high school.  I got a diploma in Spanish, took five intensive courses in Spanish, learned to travel all over the whole country.  I know every Mexican folk song.  I know all the food, the dress from every state.  I really like the country.  I learned to love it and have had projects with Mexico since, oh up until maybe two years ago, grants from University of California Mexican Universities.  And I got a small amount of funds to take me back to various places there.
Speaker 1: Now growing up in Houston [Texas] there are plenty of Mexican Americans that were--whose ancestry dates back to when it was Mexico, actually not even part of the United States.  So it's funny you can call them Mexican American cause they were--but did you have any background I guess in terms of (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well something stuck in my mind because my grandfather, my--Porche, Joe Porche had that huge farm.  He--they've been very, very, very open.  They allowed much much poorer Mexican people to live on his farm.  And I was fascinated with this.  I was I don't know, eight, nine years old we'd go and visit him and down far away from the house the way they lived was really incredible.  I mean they lived in cardboard boxes or whatever that they could gather from my grandfather and they lived with that.  And I was fascinated with these people who were from Mexico who were living like that on--out of the generosity of my grandfather.  And I--that got filed away in my head this connection with Mexico.  In addition, my grandfather hired a woman who took care of him and my aging grandmother who was a mid-wife and she spent an enormous amount of time delivering babies, all Mexican babies.  And I didn't know what was going on and I asked my mother [Ruthester Porche Cooper] once while visiting there when I was you know--why does Mrs. Shropsha (ph.) leave our house to go out with that little black bag early in the morning?  She said oh, nothing.  Don't ask such questions.  But it was because she was going to deliver Mexican babies.  So I learned to have an affection for the country when I was quite young but it got filed away and it didn't come back again until I went there.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were there a year?
Speaker 2: A year and then off and on from '66 [1966] off and on for a long time after that.
Story_ID: 31082
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you started writing here at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles]--
Speaker 2: Writing?
Speaker 1: Yeah, publishing papers here.  You may--you probably started before that but what--just kind of give us some idea of what kind of thing you--
Speaker 2: (Unclear) was I writing?
Speaker 1: --were writing about in those days?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was looking at two problems when I--I said when I do this, my research I want to do something that is kind of revolutionary and that was to show that the earthworm had an immune response.  And how do I do that?  I said okay I'm going to do skin transplants between two earthworms so I started those experiments which has been the, almost the entire mainstay of my research, some aspect of the immune system of earthworms.  But I knew it was a precarious idea and so my mentor then for my post-doc said you need to do something also that's a little bit more bread and butter like the fish project.  I said okay well we're going to look at the thymus and the immune system in frog larvae.  So I began to do work on frog larvae and the immune system but most importantly doing the work on showing that when you exchange two transplants between earthworms, unlike earthworms the graft will heal in like it will in us, but eventually the earthworm would reject it.  Well I would present this at transplantation meetings here or sometimes in Europe.  People would say oh this man is crazy.  It only happens in mice and humans.  It cannot happen.  He doesn't know what he's doing.  And they would ask questions like how does the graft heal in and do you have nerve fibers and do you have blood vessels?  So all it did was just send me back to my lab to prove the questions that they would pose about what was lacking in my experiments which is what scientific meetings are about.  You get criticized and so I published my first paper in, it's a prestigious journal called 'Transplantation,' I think in 1969 when I was sure that I had demonstrated graft rejection in earthworms and that it was an immune response.  Now what's interesting about it was that I thought that I had done an original piece of work that nobody else had done it.  When I got ready to publish to write it up, I went to the library did some research on who had published before.  The Germans had done similar work in the 1920s but the interpretation of graft rejection in earthworms in the 20s [1920s] was completely different from the interpretation that I was attaching to it which was that it was a part of the earthworm's immune system which was evidence for its existence in primitive animals.  And that eventually became accepted.  I mean it's accepted now that invertebrates have immune responses like we do.  But I had to really push the idea because people thought I was crazy with this.  So not everybody but some believed it.
Speaker 1: Well how did they think that an earthworm I guess survives in a world of bacteria and--?
Speaker 2: You don't ask those kinds of questions.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean you're just--a superb question.  Any animal can do it, it ought to be an earthworm.  They live in the soil.  But they have an efficient immune system, much more efficient than ours in many respects because we're sterilized with antibiotics and all sorts of precautions and they are not.  Now I work quite hard to prove or to add more support all the time, more support, more support, more support and I saw the opportunity to gain more disciples if I can put it like that.  That's why I started with these societies.  I would go to other countries and I would see where, oh you don't have a journal that's devoted to this?  We need a journal.  And I'd write a proposal to a publishing house and establish the first journal in this area of comparative immunology.
Speaker 1: Now that was done--?
Speaker 2: '77 [1977].
Speaker 1: '77 [1977]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it took, so you had been working in this field about well over ten years, thirteen years I guess?
Speaker 2: From sixty--yeah.  Yeah, before I saw--it was always in the back of my mind that I wanted to have my own journal [International Journal of Development and Comparative Immunology] and it's on the shelf over there.  I wanted that because nobody, no other main line journals that were devoted to rats and mice, they wouldn't publish our papers that dealt with primitive animals.  I mean they said that we were--I and my friends in various places were crazy.  But I persisted.
Speaker 1: Was it just that they felt that whatever went on biologically with primitive animals just could not be translated to (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, it could not be translated into humans or it was irrelevant.  There was just no point in my bothering with it but I persisted.  All of that fertile stuff that got cultivated with my wasp, with my father and my bees and my crayfish, all that was still inside.  And even now when I look at problems, my first question I ask is well what does--what happens in something primitive?  I don't care about what happens in humans.  I care but it's on another level.  It's not an intellectual level what, so much what happens in humans.  I'm more interested in how did it come about which is this theme of development.
Story_ID: 673286
Speaker 1: All right, my name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today with The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, could you please state your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Sure, Edwin L. Cooper [HistoryMaker Edwin Cooper], E-D-W-I-N, L., Cooper, C-O-O-P-E-R.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, sir, what is your date of birth?
Speaker 2: My birthday is December 23, 1936.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is your place of birth, sir?
Speaker 2: I was born in Oakland, Texas, which is a little village about, oh, 150 miles [sic.] west of Houston [Texas], where my parents [Ruthester Porche Cooper and Edwin Ellis Cooper] had migrated from Yoakum, Texas where they were married in another small town.  But this village then had about a hundred people.  My father was born there, my grandfather [Alan Gates Cooper], my great-grandfather [Edmund Cooper].  So it's all through that, that line that I was born in Oakland, Texas.  And my parents left there at--when I was two years old and moved to Houston and started a life there.  I've visited Oakland a couple of times when my grandfather passed away.  And it's essentially a ghost town now.  Apparently, it was a little bit better than that when I was born, but it never, it never reached a big, sort of famous place.  It did have some very decent people, most of whom were my relatives and highly accomplished people.  So it had something, it had something good about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was born there so (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).  Now, sir, what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: Now?  My occupation now is, well, I have the title of distinguished professor at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California].  I've advanced through all the stage, starting with a postdoc [post doctorate] in 1962 when I came from Brown University [Providence, Rhode Island], after receiving my Ph.D.  And I was offered this position immediately, and I essentially declined because I didn't wanna teach in a medical school.  I wanted to go back to a college of arts and science and stay with biology as a discipline.  But I was pressured a lot by the chairman of the department.  This department was and still is famous for neuroscience.  But I was asked to, or I was hired because immunology was beginning to bloom in the early '60s [1960s], and the then--the chairman then wanted someone who was up and coming to work in the field of immunology.  So I eventually accepted the position in 1964 as assistant professor, climbed through the ranks to associate, full professor, and then ten steps within the full professor rank, to the title now of distinguished professor.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're a distinguished professor of--
Speaker 2: Neurobiology.  Only for the department.  I'm not a neuroscientist.  I'm an immunologist, and that's what my reputation is built on, is, it's built on immunology, not neuroscience.  I have published some works on, on animal behavior which, of course, is related to the nervous system.  But I'm not primarily known for, for neurology or neuroscience.  Here titles don't always indicate what the person is doing.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It's, it's a place to hang your hat to--it's your home.
Story_ID: 673287
Speaker 1: Okay, just, just for the record you are known as the founder of the field of comparative immunology?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right, uh-huh, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I didn't realize it, but what day is today?  This is November, what, the 29th or 30th?
Speaker 1: That's the next question (laughter).  What, what is today's date (laughter)?  This is the--
Speaker 2: I think it's the 30th, isn't it?
Speaker 1: Thirtieth or 31st, which one is it?
Speaker 2: No, I think it's the 30th.  I mention it because I discovered--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay, November 30th.
Speaker 2: --two days ago when I was trying to do an assignment, this assignment for you, that the second edition of my first book ['Comparative Immunology,' Edwin L. Cooper] is to be published today.  And I didn't even know anything about it.  And it's 450 pages, so it's longer than it was when I first published it, I believe in 1977 [sic. 1976].  And I just discovered that, so I have written to the publisher more or less saying, "How dare you do that with- without asking (laughter) me," because it came up, they--how did it come up?  Now, they wanted to publish something else of mine, and I started to look through my list of books, and there, this one appeared.  And I got the shock that it was to be the second edition, the first one published in 1977.  So I--oh, I know what it was.  I published another twin series called 'Invertebrate Immunity,' which is the branch of comparative immunology that deals with immune systems in primitive animals.  So they asked my permission to publish one of the two.  And I insisted that I wanted both published because I published them so that they would be paired together.  So I'm waiting to hear from them and so that led me to follow, what else were they doing about me?  And that's when I discovered that my first book, the book that established comparative immunology, published in 1976, I think, that they were doing a second edition.  Now, I think they may be able to get away with not asking my permission because my book was published by Prentice Hall [Upper Saddle River, New Jersey], and Prentice Hall has long gone out of business.  And this publisher, I think must have bought the rights to publish it, and I had maybe lost the rights because the book was with Prentice Hall.  Now, the new publisher is Springer [Springer Science and Business Media, Berlin, Germany], which is a big publishing house in Germany.  So I'm waiting to hear from them on, on that, plus the second book of the invertebrate immunology twin series, which I, which I published.
Speaker 1: Well, I just wanted to establish, today is then November 30, 2012, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: Where are we at the present time?  Well, we're in the School of Medicine [David Geffen School of Medicine], University of California, Los Angeles [Los Angeles, California].  Let's see what can I tell you about UCLA?  UCLA at the moment is one of two of the premier campuses of the University of California.  It's, it's well known.  Everybody knows it.  We have something like fifty thousand applications for the college and we only take maybe four thousand.  So it's highly competitive.  So these are called UCLA and Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California] are called the flagship campuses of University of California.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, I just wanted to establish that, where we were, and we're following up on an interview that we started back in April of 2011, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 673288
Speaker 1: All right, we left off in the mid-'70s [1970s].  And in 1973, you were promoted to full professor in the department of anatomy and cell biology, right, and--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --and the Department of Neurobiology at UCLA School of Medicine [University of California, Los Angeles School of Medicine; David Geffen School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2: Right.  Well, let me clarify.  The department was called the Department of Anatomy when I was hired.  Then a significant number of us wanted to broaden the scope of the department.  So we added cell biology, anatomy and cell biology.  Then a significant group, interested in the nervous system wanted to go back to its original emphasis.  And so it was changed again to neurobiology.  It's the basic science counterpart to the department of neurology, which is entirely clinical.  But it never changed my interests, and I never changed over nor did I move.  I'm a comparative immunologist, a biologist, and that's that (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, in, now, how--were there any other African Americans on the faculty when you joined (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Then, I don't think so.  I'm almost certain there were none, no.
Speaker 1: So do you think that you may have been the first or--
Speaker 2: I could have, probably, yeah.  Maybe some, maybe one of two clinicians because I and Josephine Isabel-Jones wrote a proposal to increase the number of minority students.  That's what it was called, 'Minority Students in Medical Education' [ph.].  And we wrote a proposal, and so that probably was a stimulus to work on, to work on increasing minority students in, in the medical school.
Story_ID: 673289
Speaker 1: I think we discussed this before on some level, but, but just how, it seems to me that your work was probably controversial on some level because it was different from what everybody else was doing.  So you're founding a field, basically.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Well, the reason why I'm glad you, you've mentioned that because it was controversial.  Why was it controversial?  Because in the early '60s [1960s] immunology was exploding.  But the models used to study the immune system were mammals, mice generally, or a few people did experiments on rabbits.  But mice, and then ultimately, rats, and then only later on, chickens or birds were used to study.  But I insisted, as a biologist, with my firm background from Brown, from AU, from TSU [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas], my background was always the zoologist.  Even when I was a child, I was interested in, you know, earthworms and crayfish and animals like that and never really so much concerned about human.  I mean humans are humans.  But animals are also important.  So I, I kept that, that vision of that interests, and I asked the question when all the information was exploding on the immune system of mammals, I said, why can't we have an interests in how the immune system evolved?  What's it like in primitive animals?  They have to fight against bacteria and viruses.  And so I, the earthworm was one of my favorite animals.  I had done some regeneration studies at Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] (pause) (background noise)--
Speaker 1: Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 2: --and didn't get too far on that.  But it, it stimulated me to continue to look at them.  So when I came from Brown University [Providence, Rhode Island] to UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], I came with two ideas in mind.  I wanted to link zoology, which was primarily my interests from TSU, from AU, from Brown, I wanted to link the interests in zoology with the emerging field of immunology.  And so I said, well, why not call it comparative immunology?  There's comparative religion, there's comparative endocrinology, comparative--(gestures) we look at what situations are--we probe intellectual questions from the comparative viewpoint.  So I said, why not?  So I started to coin that phrase.  So when I came here, I came to work as the first postdoc [post doctorate] for William Hildemann [William H. Hildemann], who was then very interested also in what I, my ideas.  So I wanted to look at a vertebrate animal, and I wanted to look at an invertebrate animal.  So at--at Brown, I saw that there had been a lot of work on the thymus in mice and some work on the thymus in fish.  And I thought, ah, okay.  So I'm gonna go, and I'm gonna look the thymus in frog larvae.  So that was one of my projects that I designed when I came to UCLA.
Story_ID: 673290
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Let me just ask you--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --what is the importance of the thymus in this project (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Okay, the thymus then and now, especially then, was considered to be the master organ of immune competence.  That is, cells that originate in the thymus migrate to the periphery of the body, to lymph nodes, to spleen, a few may get into the bone marrow where they then mature and make sure that the body is covered, make sure that the body develops its immunity.  Without the thymus, an individual cannot develop an immune response.  And there are (background noise)--
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.  Can you just repeat that sentence in--
Speaker 2: Sure.  The immune--
Speaker 1: About the thymus, yeah.
Speaker 2: --system is controlled by, early on in development, by the thymus because the thymus is a huge organ in neonatal animals.  It's quite large, and I've done experiments on that.  But that's a little bit later.  Cells migrate out to the periphery and go to lymph nodes in various locations, the spleens, the bone marrow and there, equip the body, all bodies, whether it's fish bodies, human bodies, mouse bodies, equip the body to ward off infections.  So my first experiments with amphibians on the thymus was to take out the thymus out of frog larvae and test to see if they had an immune response after taking it out.  Well, my work agreed with the mammalian work and that is, you take out the thymus, the animals become incapable of mounting an immune response.  So I thought, okay, it works, others were doing it in mammals, and I proved that it existed in a primitive vertebrate like a frog larvae which is an amphibian.  It's, it's more advanced than fish, but it's still a primitive animal, if you compare it with, with humans.  Now, with respect to the immune response in invertebrates, I thought, why don't I develop experiments to show that if you make- exchange transplants between two earthworms, would they take--and if they take, how long do they take, and, or, are they eventually rejected because the earthworm has an immune response, because at that time, these were the first experiments that were being done to look at the immune response in mice, in rats, to some extent in chickens, and later on in humans, that if you exchange a graft, like a skin graft, that the immune system will look at that graft and say, that's not my, my tissue.  It's foreign, so reject it.  Well, I did the same experiment in earthworms and found that if I exchanged grafts between two earthworms, that were different, the grafts would heal in, but it would eventually be rejected.  And I thought millions of years ago, this immune system evolved early, that not only was it present in primitive vertebrates, our nearest kin, but millions of years earlier, it evolved in animals that were really quite primitive.  Well, when I started to report this information in meetings, people in attendance said, this fellow is crazy.  It just doesn't exist.  They were, as now, anthropocentric, concerned about human systems only (background noise)--
Story_ID: 673291
Speaker 1: So, this demonstration that grafts exchanged between two earthworms would heal in and then eventually be rejected, and it was rejected how?  So then I began to look for mechanisms, searched in the cavity of earthworms which is called the celoma cavity.  It's the analog of the peritoneal [cavity] in humans.  There are lots of cells that are around in here, so you have similar cells in the earthworm.  But reporting on this information, which was an exciting finding, that a simple animal like an earthworm could reject a graft, created quite a storm.  And there were those who praised it, but there were those who said I was crazy.  (Laughter) And each time I went to meetings and reported it, somebody would ask pointed questions, and I would head straight back to the lab, do what they were worried about and then go to the next meeting and report again what I had just found.  For example, they said, "Well how do you know the graft is vascularized? You know, blood vessels grow in and nerves grow in."  So I went back, made histological sections, showed the presence of nerves, showed the presence of blood vessels.  So that solved that problem.  And I continued to go on and on and on.  But that still did get at the mechanism of graft rejection which I suspected was due to cells that infiltrate the graft the same way they infiltrate a graft in humans.  If you make a skin graft, it, there's an infiltrate that goes there to get rid of it.  It's foreign.  So then I, much like--I kept this idea in mind, looked at the cells, learned a lot about the cells.  But it still didn't tell me what capacity the cells had.  So on one of my sabbaticals, I went to Italy to work with a lab that was well known for isolating human leukocytes or human white cells [white blood cells].  And if you, if I give you a slide with earthworm leukocytes or white cells and give you a companion slide of human cells, you wouldn't know the difference.  They look quite, very much alike.  There are small ones, and there are big ones.  There's some that contain granules and some that don't contain granules.  So they're really highly potent as, as immune cells.  So for the first time, I did experiments with a group in Modena in Italy, in northern Italy at the university [University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy] there.  They were quite good at taking human cells, isolating them, and then mixing them with cancer cells to see if those human immune cells would kill cancer cells.  Well, they did.  So I suggested to the head of the lab, I said, I want to do the same with earthworm cells.  We did a lot of experiments.  I think I published about five papers out of about a few months of work, intense work, on the capacity of earthworm cells when put in tissue culture with cancer cells, would attach onto those cancer cells and immediately kill them.  But the essence of the finding was this, that no longer would we view the simple immune system as only phagocytosis.  We have a population of cells in our bodies that do only phagocytosis and then others that stick onto foreign material and, and kill it.  That's a very sophisticated response.  So what I wanted to do was to show, all right, well, we've got phagocytic cells in earthworms, and we have cells in earthworms that stick onto a foreign target cell like a cancer cell if they are mixed together.  And that one will kill it, but it's the phagocytic cell which will go and clean up all the debris after the killing is done.  It's like a battle.  There are films that have been made to show how these, these cells kill something, and then another batch of them, another army comes in and cleans up the mess.  And that happens in our bodies every day.  So at that level of evolution, I showed for the first time the separation of the phagocytic process from the killing process because before that, we thought, they accepted, okay, Cooper, fine, they, phagocytosize.  I said, that's not all they can do.  They can kill, and they can also phagocytose.  So I--it's the first time that these two functions had been delineated in evolution.  That was a kind of a major, major finding.
Story_ID: 673292
Speaker 1: Now, did-- you must have had the support of your bosses here at the UCLA Medical Center [Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, Los Angeles, California], I guess on some level or someone was, you know, they were keeping you growing and moving in this direction, right?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head) I don't know exactly what you're asking, but I've never had to have anybody keep me growing (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: All they had to do was to try and dampen me a little bit--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because I, I mean this is a very--well, in general, most universities are free, free to think, free to explore, free to do exactly what you want to do.  And I never received any kind of hints.  "Oh, you should head in this direction," or--I never received any kind of encouragement.  As I said, if anything, some might have wanted to (laughter) calm me down with (laughter)--my enthusiasm hasn't changed since I was five or six years old for what I was, was interested in at, at different levels.  And so, no, I didn't, I needed--well all I needed was more and more money.  That's what I needed.  And I did get funded well by the American Cancer Society, the National Institutes of Health [NIH], the National Science Foundation until I reached a level of, well, a high level here, and money started to dwindle.  And younger people who I had helped a lot, internationally, were growing, and they needed the money.  I didn't need the money anymore to really augment my career.  But they needed it.  They had to have grants to do--so I then began to travel a lot.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, I just wanted to (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Sure, okay, sorry.
Speaker 1: --to get that part out.
Story_ID: 673293
Speaker 1: Let's go back to, now, you're still building this field and defining it.  And in 1976 (background noise), 1976, I guess in the years leading up to 1976, you're putting together (background noise) the--let's just pause a second--building your case for comparative immunology.  In '76 [1976], you published a textbook, 'Comparative Immunology' [Edwin L. Cooper].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And as you said earlier, in the beginning, it was published by Prentice Hall [Upper Saddle River, New Jersey], and what was the reception of your book?
Speaker 2: Well, it--the reception was good because I was fortunate that a friend at UC Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California], who was a comparative endocrinologist, started to read about my work, pushing comparative immunology, and he was the editor of a series of books, an immunobiology series or a comparative biology series.  And so he thought, well, how about some immunology?  So he invited me to write, I think it was twelve issues, twelve volumes in that series.  And I was asked to do the immunology version.  And that's how I published my, my first book.  Now, there was a collaborator on the book, and this was a little bit touchy at first.  I won't call any names and say anything, but there was a collaborator.  And that person I wanted off to work with me because that person didn't know anything about comparative immunology, was primarily a mouse immunologist, and I could never make significant progress pushing the emphasis on, on primitive animals.  And so eventually I, I sort of voiced this, and that person was removed as a collaborator so that I stayed as the sole collaborator of, of the book.  It was translated into Russian.  Yeah, translated into Russian, and then I published a couple of--one paper in French.  And then even earlier on, I had been invited by UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] to go to Mexico to live and work and set up a lab like mine here.  And I've got some papers in Spanish also that I published there, showing graft rejection in Mexican earthworms.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is, it's--did the international attention exceed the, the national attention?
Speaker 2: Maybe a little.  Maybe in Europe and Japan.  China, of course, was completely closed then, although I went shortly after that, but it was closed.  Maybe in Europe and in, in, in Japan, there was a little more enthusiasm, and there still is, than in the United States.  Sometimes the United States is slower to--to grab onto certain kinds of ideas.  I mean we're an excellent country for doing some things, but there's some ideas that come from other places too.  And I wanted to exploit those or to become a part of those.  So I, I did certain things, for example, I've got friends and colleagues who were in Eastern European countries.  They couldn't get out because the, the Soviet bloc held them.  People in Hungary and Poland and then Czechoslovakia, which is now the Czech Republic, they couldn't get out to go to meetings, and they were doing some important work, very, very important work that would support what I was doing, and therefore, I wanted to bring them into the, in- into the fold.  And so I saw opportunities to organize meetings there for them so that, so that they could participate in this international view.  And that helped them a lot, especially in Eastern Europe, not so much in Western Europe at all because it was like here.  But they were still rather open, and I think one of the reasons why they were open was because they remained rather more classical in their approach like I had coming from AU [Atlanta University; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] and Brown University [Providence, Rhode Island], which was more classical, zoology, biology, than something that was a little bit more, more modern.  And so I found some colleagues in Europe, especially in France, two in particular--an interesting coincidence, two in particular who were doing exactly the same experiments that I was doing.  (Laughter) And this can be, this can be really very, very good.  It depends on how you look at it.  It can be a shock, but it can also be good, especially if they do exactly--if they get the same results.  That's one of the best things in science is if somebody else--you confirm somebody else's work or somebody confirms your work.  It's a little, makes you a little bit nervous at first because it's competitive, and you thought, well, who got there first?  Did I do it first or that one did it first?  And there's, there's been some little stuff, but that's all pushed aside now.  But I remember discovering one group.  They had done earthworm transplants and they had taken out the thymus out of frog larvae, and I thought this is, I thought it was all mine (laughter), and we never corresponded with each other.  And then all of a sudden, I went to a meeting in Europe and discover- we, we met each other.
Story_ID: 673294
Speaker 1: Now, in 1977, you, you become the founding editor of international journal--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: of development.
Speaker 1: --of development--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and comparative immunology [Developmental and Comparative Immunology].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, so, did you then orches- you know, bring in all these strands of research that are similar to yours and publish them?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's a good question.  I thought, well, the book ['Comparative Immunology,' Edwin L. Cooper] is published.  And then there were a couple of other published books.  I thought, well, we were already having problems, those few of us around the world interested in invertebrate immunity or lower vertebrate immunity.  I thought, well, why don't I start a journal?  Nobody else is doing it.  So let's, let's start a journal.  I wrote a proposal.  I went to I don't know how many publishers.  Nobody wanted it.  So eventually, I got a letter from Pergamon Press [Oxford, England] which was a well known, what we like to call a supermarket kind of publisher.  They published a lot of different journals, and the proposal was accepted.  And I'll never forget, it was nineteen seventy--the fall of 1976, I think it was, that I got the okay that they would publish it.  And the first issue and first volume came out in 1977.  Well, that was, I was quite happy for that, but much to my, I don't know, disappointment and--oh, just disappointment, was this journal was a cut and paste journal.  Now, I don't know if you, you're probably to know what cut and paste journals are (laughter), but this company decided, well, we'll publish it, but you have got to--once you have peer reviewed papers, you have to cut and paste the contents of the paper, the introduction, the abstract, the materials and methods, the results, the discussion, the bibliography.  We will provide you with the sheets that have the spaces to cut and paste these components.  Well, I hired my wife [Helene Cooper] to do this.  Our children were young.  I hired my wife to do it.  She liked doing this, but I hated.  But why did I--didn't like it because it looked nonprofessional.  I have all the volumes from that.  You had typescripts that came from Eastern Europe that were done on manual typewriters, old, manual typewriters.  We were just beginning to get, I think electric ones ourselves.  Mistakes were hard to correct.  I mean it was, in my opinion, really a mess.  But I stuck with it because I thought, this is my chance.  Nobody else wanted it, and they were, they did everything possible to keep promoting the journal.  And so it eventually was set and typed like all other journals.  It's totally electronic now, like every other journal.  And it ranks as, in the top ten, of immunology journals, published by Elsevier [Amsterdam, Netherlands] now.  And my name as founding editor in chief is still on the masthead, 1977, which, (shrugs) fine.  It's, but I didn't like it at first, but sometimes you have to put up with circumstances and work around--our colleague is looking me.  I don't know what that means.
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: All right, so--
Speaker 1: So the journal, I, I stuck with it, and it had a lot of, eventually, a lot of benefits, and a lot of intrigue around it, especially, the owner of the publishing company [Robert Maxwell] was a powerful man in England.  I mean, and I got--and I and four hundred other editors got invited to his sixty-fifth birthday, all-expense paid to Oxford, England, and staying in a 15th century hotel.  I mean it was really, really something.  And all this came as a result of, of this journal.  And then his wife did a special issue devoted to his birthday, and all the editors were asked to write a chapter for her.  And so I wrote about the history--my journal then was ten years old.  This was 1987, I think when that came about.  So like many things in my life, it worked, even though I was not very happy with it at first.  I always think that, fine, something doesn't work.  But you've gotta make it work.  You've got to, you've gotta have a vision about what you want and then work toward that.  And it did.
Story_ID: 673295
Speaker 1: That's (pause)--same year in 1977, you received an American Cancer Society Eleanor Roosevelt International Cancer Fellowship to study in Switzerland, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, tell us about that experience.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was an interesting experience.  It was my second sabbatical leave from UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California].  The first was 1970, and I had a Guggenheim [Guggenheim fellowship].  I don't want that to get omitted because a Guggenheim is a very, very prestigious award to have to go anywhere you want, do whatever you want.  And so I received a Guggenheim in 1970 for studies in comparative immunology.  Already, I was beginning to make, make an impact.  So then I received a Roosevelt Fellowship, another prestigious one, to go to the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research in Switzerland [Zurich, Switzerland], where there, I continued to look at this idea that these worm cells could kill cancer cells.  It was a, it was an interesting year.  I liked the year in Sweden better than the year in Switzerland for, they're just different countries.  Sweden was a very progressive country and a very interesting country, then, still is now.  It's changed a lot because 1970, how many years ago is that, thirty--well, almost forty years.  I found it to be a perfect society.  There was a lot of upheaval in the United States in the early '70s [1970s], late '60s [1960s], early '70s [1970s], Vietnam War, race relations, all of this was a lot of pressure here.  And I had just, well, I was weary of it.  And so I got a chance to go away.  I said that I'd like to go (laughter) as far away from controversy as I could, and Sweden was that.  I mean it was what I considered a perfect society, highly taxed, but no evidence of poverty, no conflicts, no war, nothing.  And so it was a good year.
Speaker 1: But, but how was Switzerland different in--
Speaker 2: Well, Switzerland is different in being very correct, but I don't know whether, maybe you don't wanna publish it, but extremely boring (laughter).  It's correct, but they, it's a culture that's uninvolved.  They, they finger point and--fine, I was okay there.  And the lab was fine.  People were fine, but I just wasn't excited.  I could hardly wait to come back to the United States because things started to settle down here by 1977, and, but it was a prestigious award.  And I got a lot out of it.
Story_ID: 673296
Speaker 1: Now, it says here on our outline that you worked with Dr. Jean-Charles Cerottoni (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Cerottini [Jean-Charles Cerottini].
Speaker 1: Cerottini.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was his laboratory where I went.  Yeah, I mean he saw my letter.  I said, "I have a Roosevelt Fellowship [Eleanor Roosevelt International Cancer Fellowship] to come."  He said, "Oh, please do come."
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: I don't know what he's doing now.  I haven't followed him.  The only people I'm still in contact with are the group, is the group in, in Italy.  I'm still in contact with them because it was later.  Cerottini and the ones, the one who I worked with in Sweden has, has long since died.  And I don't know what's happened to Cerottini.
Speaker 1: Okay, was Cerottini a part of the International Society for the Development of Comparative Immunology [sic. International Society of Developmental and Comparative Immunology] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: He wasn't?
Speaker 2: None of these persons were.  I intentionally chose to go to labs that were famous for looking at the immune system in humans, but who were open to my ideas because I needed their, I needed their technical expertise.  And I needed their acceptance that I had confirmed in my primitive studies, what they had done in, in humans.  And that's the reason I would not go with my equivalent colleagues, say in Japan or in France or someplace like that because it was just, what do you call it, preaching to the choir.  And so I wanted the input from the real, the, you know, the experts.
Story_ID: 673297
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about, now, you cofounded, so there's another founder, I guess, of the International Society for the Development of Comparative Immunology [sic. International Society of Developmental and Comparative Immunology], right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, it's listed as cofounder, but actually, I was another driving force for that society.  I thought, well, here we have a journal [Developmental and Comparative Immunology].  Let's, now, the next step is we need to have meetings periodically.  So we had our first meeting in Scotland, and I'm listed as a cofounder, but I was always the driving (pause) (background noise)--I was always the driving (background noise).
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Can you start that sentence from the beginning, please?
Speaker 2: Sure.  I was always the driving force, even though I'm listed as, sometimes as cofounder most, more, it's generally internationally agreed that I started the book ['Comparative Immunology,' Edwin L. Cooper], the journal, the society.  We had our first--third meeting here, no, second meeting here in Los Angeles [California].  And (laughter), I announced, when we had our first little one, the little nuclear meeting in Scotland, I said, "Come to Los Angeles.  I'll host you all there.  We've got perfect climate, perfect weather.  It never rains.  It's ideal." So in August of, I think, 1983, '82 [1982], '83 [1983], here comes the group to Los Angeles.  So I had arranged a program, you know, of first introductory night, you know, with cocktails and music and a kind of ceremony.  And then the next sessions, the days for the week.  It started to rain--this was in August.  It started to rain the first night.  I'll never forget because I invited--the Mexican population is very strong here, and I had worked in Mexico.  So I had a lot of affinity with them.  So I invited a group of mariachis.  You probably know mariachi music, you know, with guitars (gestures).
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I invited them, and they had to stand in the rain at one of our buildings here (laughter).  That was the first night.  We had, you know, tequila and all of that, and the, I got finger pointed for the whole seven days they were here because it rained every day during August, and I had promised in Scotland, "It'll never rain in Los Angeles.  Don't worry."  So that was about the meeting here.  And then we started to have the third meeting I held, I pushed for that, to have it in France.
Speaker 1: Now, I had a question though--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --about the first meeting.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Why, if you're founding a new organization, did you have a particularly strong group in Scotland?
Speaker 2: No, it was about like a group in France or any--we were dotted around in various countries all over the world, one or two people who were pushing the cause.  And we had this colleague of mine who was willing to host us for this first, sort of organizational meeting.  And that's why we had it in Scotland.
Speaker 1: Okay, I, I wondered 'cause a lot of times, if, if you found a group, you host the meeting yourself first to get, set a tone.
Speaker 2: No, I mean I like, fine, we had our first one there.  It was convenient that we had it.  And then I brought the second here to Los Angeles, and the third we went--I tried to rotate between locations.  And very, for the very first time, we had our thirteenth meeting in Japan this year.  And for the first time, I didn't go.  I couldn't go.  So I was, I was not there for that one.
Speaker 1: This is the first one you've missed?
Speaker 2: That's the first one that I've missed, yeah.  But I thought it's well on the way, and I don't know.  It was inconvenient.  I couldn't go.  And so I had another one that I had to go to, and so I just didn't go.
Speaker 1: Now, so the meeting is not annual because--
Speaker 2: No, it's tri-annual, every three years.
Speaker 1: Yeah, started in '83 [1983], right, the meetings?
Speaker 2: Starting in, no, a little bit earlier, '78 [1978] or something like that.  Eighty-three [1983] was the second one here in Los Angeles--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in '83 [1983], I think it was.
Speaker 1: All right, 'cause the organization was founded in '78 [1978], so--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and so three years later we had the next one here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The second one and then the third one in France.  Oh, to be honest, I've forgotten where we came for the fourth.  Maybe we came back to the United States.  And I started pushing early on to have, we need to go to Asia.  We need to go to Japan 'cause they had a, you know, a growing population of people there who were interested in this.  So finally, this year, we went, and it was almost blocked because the tsunami was in northern Japan, and people were afraid of a possible earthquake in this, during the time of this second, this meeting, which was in, although in southern Japan, Japan's a small country.  And so there was some apprehension.  I don't know how many people attended.  I think the attended was probably down a bit.  But, and then a lot of people from the United States and Europe didn't wanna go because they always said, "Oh, going to Japan is too expensive, going to Japan is too expensive."  So, even though I had pushed it for a long time, this was the first year we ever got it through.
Story_ID: 673298
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, I guess in 19--this would be, I guess '79 [1979] or '80 [1980], you were also the coeditor of 'Animal Models of Comparative and Developmental Aspects of Immunity and Disease' [M. Eric Gershwin and Edwin L. Cooper].
Speaker 2: Yeah, that book got, as I recall, it got started with one colleague who is at the UC--University of California, Davis [Davis, California].  He's a rheumatologist.  So he's a clinician, and somehow, I met him at a meeting, and we talked.  And we decided to edit a book, coedit a book that dealt, that started to relate more of immune systems of primitive animals to human conditions.  And so, he being the rheumatologist, the medical doctor, and I, from the basic end, we put together that volume.  So it's among some of my books, edited books, and, yeah, among some of my edited books.
Story_ID: 673299
Speaker 1: Okay, now, over the course of the next decade, and I don't wanna skip over anything, but from 1980 to 1988, at least, you worked at a number of institutions around the world.  You were in Spain.  You were at the University of Tromso in Norway [University of Tromso - the Arctic University of Norway, Tromso, Norway], University of Leon in Spain [Leon, Spain], university of Cairo in Egypt [Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Yamaguchi University, Japan [Yamaguchi, Japan].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: University of Palermo in Italy [Palermo, Italy], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: From 19--
Speaker 2: Which do you wanna hear about first (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Well, let's start chronologically with, I guess the university of Complutense [Complutense University of Madrid, Madrid, Spain]--
Speaker 2: Complutense in Spain, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, in Spain.
Speaker 2: Well, that got started when I was in Switzerland.  Switzerland was '77 [1977].  I met a young investigator [Agustin Zapata] who was interested in the immune system of fish.  So being the editor of Developmental and Comparative Immunology, he sent his paper to me, or papers, but he sent one to me and it was this thick.  And I started to advise him then, I said, "We can't publish anything that big.  You're gonna have, you know, cut it, cut it and let's make it into several papers."  Well, he didn't understand that.  Coming from Spain, the fatter the (laughter) publication, the more it was looked as being a better document, not realizing--this was the old fashioned way of publishing, the fatter the better.  Germans did it and all Europeans did it, but we, Americans, thought more practically.  And I said, "No, I can't, I can't publish this.  But I will help you."  So my wife [Helene Cooper] and I went from Switzerland to Spain to meet him for the first time.  I didn't know who he was or--not personally, anyway, which is the same for 90 percent of most of these people.  So I met him, maybe in Madrid [Spain].  I can't remember.  He was really quite nervous.  He didn't know quite what to expect.  So when he met me, you know, he was literally, I don't know, chewing (laughter) his fingernails (laughter).  And when he met me and my wife, he said, "Oh, excuse me."  So he went to the phone, and I overheard the conversation because I understand, I speak Spanish.  So he, I heard him telling his wife, "Oh, you have to come.  This man, he, he's fine.  I don't have to worry about anything.  I've met him, and he's nice, and he's this and that."  So I started to work with him, and he wan- he insisted that, he wanted to come here to Los Angeles [California] to work with me.  So he came to Los Angeles and spent a year.  But he was a little bit--when you go to another country, I don't--even if everything is pretty much like where you are, you still look like a fish out of water.  You have to adjust.  He had a difficult time adjusting.  And honestly, he tried my patience more (laughter) than anybody else, but a good friend.  But he had a lot of difficulty, first of all because he left his wife and little son in Spain.  And he came here.  He was alone.  Well, I used to do as much as possible to make him feel at home, but he was still not quite right.  So it just, he, I became so impatient with him.  He said, "Oh, I just have to go home."  I said, "Go, but maybe you ought to stay and not come back again."  I said that pretty much bluntly because I had just pretty much had enough of trying to make him happy.  I was, it just was impossible.  He said, "No, I will go and I will come, I will be fine."  So he did.  He came, he went and came back.  And he was okay.  Well, what did we do?  There were a lot of trips back and forth between me and him.  I was going through one of his closets in his office.  I found stacks of electron micrographs.  Those electron micrographs showed me that he was really a high powered, electron microscopist, just beautiful pictures of the immune system in fish, the spleen, the lymph--the thymus, all of this.  So I said, "What are you gonna do with these, these pictures here," electron micrographs mostly, not light micrographs, but electron micrographs, high powered.  So he said that, "Oh, this is all for the trash.  I don't need any of those."  I said, "No, this is not for the trash," I said, "we're gonna write a book ['The Immune System: Comparative Histophysiology,' Agustin G. Zapata and Edwin L. Cooper]."
Story_ID: 673300
Speaker 1: So (laughter), I got a contract.  I wrote to a publisher, said, "We want to write a book on the comparative histophysiology of the immune system."  And I said, "We're gonna do that, and we're gonna focus on fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and monitoring mammals.  We're not gonna focus on humans or mice or rats.  We're gonna focus on more primitive animals."  So we did.  The book got published, but it almost didn't get published because he lost interest, lost patience.  In order to finish the book, I had to do everything possible to coerce him, push him to, let's finish this.  This is a unique book, let's do it.  But I cou- so at that time, I had taken another sabbatical leave in Egypt, was living in Egypt.  I don't know if that's on your list, but was 1988 (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's '85 [1985], in '85 [1985], it says here (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Eighty-five [1985], yeah, something like that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So we went on a cruise down the Nile [River] in Egypt.  I invited him to come from Spain to Egypt, and I said, "Okay, I'm gonna (laughter), I'm gonna trap him on this boat, and he cannot escape.  And we're gonna finish this book while we're on the cruise."  So if you look at the introduction of the book, it says, "A portion of this book was completed while on a cruise in Egypt" (laughter).  And that was one way that I finished it, was to get him isolated somewhere where I could say, "Okay, you sit here, and you finish this book."  So that's, I mean it was not a lot to finish, but we did wrap it up then.  But that's really--that's one memory that came out of it.  I mean we're friends, long since then.
Speaker 2: What's his name?
Speaker 1: Zapata is his last name, Agustin Zapata.  And so the book is, I think it's Zapata-Cooper.  I gave, so I let him be the first author.  I think it's Zapata--'Comparative Histophysiology of the Immune System' [sic. 'The Immune System: Comparative Histophysiology,' Agustin G. Zapata and Edwin L. Cooper].  It's still in print, and I later on learned--this is an interesting thing.  Somebody, I can't remember what country, asked me if I had an extra copy of the book because he wanted to copy something out or wanted to make slides or whatever.  And he said, I told him, I said, "I can look around, but I'm not--why do you want one?"  He said, "Well, I would like it, but they only have one left in print, and it's worth $900."  And he says, "I don't have $900 (laughter) to pay for the book."  And I couldn't believe it.  I didn't know that books when going out of print, the price is raised.  So it was $900.  I don't know what it is now.  That's been, I don't know, ten years ago maybe since that announcement came.  I haven't searched it, but if you Google right, you can see all the books.  And some of them, it'll say, paperback version or slightly used and, so this one was $900.
Speaker 2: Okay, wow, that's quite a story, and--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 673301
Speaker 1: Is there a story about your trip to University of Tromso in Norway [University of Tromso - the Arctic University of Norway, Tromso, Norway]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, the, yeah, Tromso [Norway] was, was good because this was a meeting that was just devoted to phagocytosis, this process of the body having cells that will find something foreign, engulf it and get rid of it.  That happens.  So this was on phagocytosis.  And I was invited because of the work on earthworms, showing that they were, they had cells that would kill foreign materials, but cells that would phagocytose.  Well, what was interesting--
Speaker 1: Can you spell, I'm sorry, phago- but can you phagocytosis for us?
Speaker 2: Yeah, phago, P-H-A-G-O-C-Y-T-O-S-I-S, phagocytosis.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: It's cell eating.  So the meeting was interesting.  Why?  Because it's so far north.  Tromso is above the polar circle.  It's far high--it's high in, geographically in Norway.  When the plane was landing, I thought, where am I?  I'm in another world altogether, but I was still on the planet earth, but if you look out, and there were snow drifts, and this was in August or something like that.  It was during the time of summer solstice so that it never, but essentially, it's daylight all the time.  So that was the most interesting part of the whole trip, was this being confronted with constant daylight.  And all hotels, rooms everything have black shades, so when you come in at night, you pull down the shades in order to sleep.  Otherwise, it's very difficult to sleep.  The sun essentially never sets, especially--when is the solstice, middle of June, something like that.  And they arranged--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, June 21st (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --yeah, they arranged the meeting so that we could experience this.  That was, that was quite phenomenal to be there during that time.  I think I've gone back another time since then.
Speaker 1: I think it, likewise in December, around the winter--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Of course (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --solstice, it stays night, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, I (background noise).  We experienced that because I, I went through a full year living in Sweden on the Guggenheim [Guggenheim fellowship].  So we saw winter, summer, spring, fall, all of that in Sweden.  So I knew what to expect, but I didn't know, I didn't have the contrast like we had in Sweden.  Sweden, we could see, see, the four--I mean I would go home at five o'clock or six o'clock, and it's pitch black.  It's dark, it's, you know, it's night.  And at two o'clock, oh, the sun comes up around twelve, but it never gets above the horizon, and then it goes down almost immediately.  So it starts to get dark around two in the afternoon.  That was hard to adjust when we were in Sweden, but an interesting feature of living in Sweden is we were, as a visiting investigator, we were invited to a Nobel ceremony, so I've been to one Nobel Prize ceremony, the one in 1970 or seventy--yeah, '70 [1970], December of 1970.
Speaker 1: Who won?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember, I think Solzhenitsyn [Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn] was the literature prize.  The science, the medicine prize I think went to somebody at, at National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland on the, some aspect of the nervous system.  But that, that was an impressive one, when we lived in Sweden.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we were housed in a building that was just for investigators.  And interesting, because we, we walked to the ceremony in black tie.  You know, it was, the street was full of snow, but it was close enough to where we lived, so it was really special.
Story_ID: 673302
Speaker 1: Now what about in '85 [1985] at the University of Leon in Spain [Leon, Spain]?  Is this with--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's still with--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --Dr. Zapata [Agustin Zapata] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --Zapata.  I was still, Zapata, but by then, Zapata started to already have his finished Ph.D. students.  So they were in essence my professional grandchildren, so to speak.  And so, I was, one of them invited me to go there.  And I just heard from that one there maybe three or four months ago.  He wanted me to send some of my more recent papers, and I did.  And I'll never forget.  He, among all the others that would come here visiting, I, we did a lot to make them at home because it's not easy to adjust in a foreign country.  And I remember the mirror around--I mean the frame around our mirror, I put 'em all the work when they come and stayed in my house.  He (laughter), he had to put the frame around it.  It was one couple from India.  We had to set up bank accounts for them and let them--I mean they stayed with us about two weeks.  I did all, I don't do that anymore because nobody comes to, nobody comes to visit now because they're all--well, I don't have a lab any longer.  I still write a lot.  I still do the same thing, but NIH [National Institutes of Health] doesn't have any money to give people whose career needs it, let alone me.  I mean I, it's very difficult to get money now.
Speaker 1: All the cutbacks these days, I guess.
Speaker 2: Very difficult.  So I rely on traveling, getting invitations to go and write and do collaborations like that, which is what happens to many people.
Speaker 1: So on this subject, then the Cold War, I know brought about an increased emphasis on STEM [science, technology, engineering and mathematics] education in the United States--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and, you know, how have things dropped off since--
Speaker 2: Well, I've been on a STEM committee here at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] for, I've forgotten.  It's at least, that's ten years ago, I think I was on a STEM committee here.  And it was, you know, and we did a lot to promote and to push, and things were up.  But I think it's less now.  I haven't been in contact with--I don't even know if we have, we probably had the equivalent of the STEM committee now, but maybe not, not formally, some people who are still doing it.  But I served on the committee for a long time and tried to push, had visits to the lab.  But somehow a lot of students were not so--they're more interested, at all levels, they're more interested in medical school than the kind of work I do.  My (laughter) my work doesn't interest a lot of people.  They, they wanna go to medical school.
Story_ID: 673303
Speaker 1: All right, okay, now, well, tell us about, also in '85 [1985], you went to the university of Cairo [Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt].  And this was where you finished a book ['The Immune System: Comparative Histophysiology,' Agustin G. Zapata and Edwin L. Cooper] with Dr. Zapata [Agustin Zapata], but--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --what else did you in Cairo [Egypt] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: What, like in Cairo?  Cairo was a very, very fine experience, I think, first of all because I had a Fulbright Fellowship.  These are also prestigious.  Fulbrights are for Americans and Fulbrights are for foreigners.  And, of course, I went there with my usual kind of enthusiasm.  I had a little bit of problems, not really problems, but when I arrived, there was some reticence on the part of the head of the lab to sort of steer students in the direction of, of research.  And the person was really rather aggressive, and the only time that I had received that kind of reception.  And so I said to, I said to the person, I said, "Look, I'm here to collaborate, promote international understanding as far as shared cultures or shared ideas."  I said, "I am not here to threaten to--I don't want you to feel threatened, and if you feel like that, I can pack up my bags and go back to Los Angeles [California].  I don't need this."  From that day on, we were solid friends.  And so it started off for at least a day, not too good.  But for the rest of the time it was absolutely a most enjoyable experience, interesting, much more interesting than living in Switzerland, which was the one before that.  We learned a little bit of Arabic, learned how to be very, very sympathetic to Islam, the culture from, from there, although Egypt is, is different.  Egypt has had a big international influence for a long, long time.  So they, they're a little bit different from other countries, other Islamic countries.  But we really, we really enjoyed, we really enjoyed living there.  Our chil- our daughter wanted to go to the American school [American International School of Egypt, Cairo, Egypt].  She went to the American school.  Our son wanted to go to the French school, and so we did that.  We had an experience, interesting experience, kind of frightening.  There was a riot in Cairo, and the riot--because I had a Fulbright Fellowship, I was sort of semi--what do you call it, not watched, but taken care of by the American embassy.  We had all these invitations to go to embassy functions.  The Fulbright foundation [Fulbright Program] found a place for us to stay, and I remember when the riots started, we were--I forget the word now, when you cannot leave a residence.  It's not quarantine.  It's called, what?  What word am I searching for?  Not quarantine.  Anyway, we were locked up in our residence for two weeks and couldn't go out except at a certain hour to buy food and then back in.  Our daughter was completely isolated in that American compound where she was part of the American school.  They sent a driver to pick me up and my son, bring us back to our residence.  So we had kind of special privileges because of my Fulbright Fellowship.  I helped them a lot to publish because they, Egypt was then and still it's not a rich country.  And they didn't have a lot of sophisticated equipment.  So I had to figure out, how am I gonna do projects or help them do meaningful projects with an incredibly limited budget.  So what I did was to put them on the map as being a center for looking at the immune systems of animals that lived in the desert because it's a desert climate.  And it turns out that they have snakes and they have lizards that have interesting immune systems because of them living in this kind of, essentially, a hot environment all the time.  So it's a very, it's a good place for looking at the immune system of reptiles.  In fact, I gave them the name R-I-G, which was the reptile immunology group, to kind of set them off and put them on the map as a center for looking at the immune system in reptiles.  And they had a fair number of people who went to them to look at this kind of problem, and they were able to get out.  So it was, it was a very productive period.  And that was the last of one, more or less, the last of a full year sabbatical, Sweden, Switzerland, Egypt and then somewhat in Italy too, but not, not as intense as those first three.
Story_ID: 673304
Speaker 1: And you were in Japan too, I believe (unclear)--
Speaker 2: I started to go to Japan in 1977, and '77 [1977] up until maybe two years ago, I would go every two years for some, something I was invited to go and established a strong friendship with one colleague there.  And that's how I obtained funds to sponsor the second journal which is Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine.  To start that journal was through him.  He, he gave the funds to Oxford University Press [Oxford, England] to help publish that journal.  And so I went to Japan a lot.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, let's see, now, in fact, in 1981, the Mayor's Medal from the mayor of Verona, Italy.  Now, what is the story behind that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was during a meeting in Verona, and my, my Italian colleagues thought enough of what I had been doing to push this comparative immunology because they had a number of people there interested in these immune systems of primitive animals.  And so they thought during this meeting--I helped them to organize that.  That was sort of independent of the society.  It was a subsidiary meeting, a kind of satellite meeting.  I saw the possibility of tacking it on to another meeting that was held, and either it was before or after.  We call those satellite meetings.  And so, they thought, well, we really have to show some sort of appreciation to Cooper [HistoryMaker Edwin Cooper] for all he's done.  And so, they got, they got permission to give me the Mayor's Medal from Verona.  And I received a similar one here in Los Angeles [California] once, from I think Bradley [Tom Bradley] was then the mayor.  When I had the, in fact, the Congress, the second ISDCI Congress [International Society of Developmental and Comparative Immunology] was held here, and I have a citation from the mayor's office, a big (gesture) plaque.  It's not among those over there, but it's at home, I think--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --for that.
Story_ID: 673305
Speaker 1: Now, during the 1980s, it says here that there was an increased, there was a marked increase in the discovery of immunological proteins.  And is this because of your work (unclear)--?
Speaker 2: Is this what?
Speaker 1: Do you think that's because of your work?  It says here, I just have a note here that in the 1980s there was a marked increase in the discovery of immunological proteins.  Did that--
Speaker 2: I don't think that, no, I think that that's probably independent of what I was doing because the focus then and now has always been on the direct relevance to the human immune system.  And most immunologists still don't know about the significance of this early work.  Now, they do (background noise)--
Speaker 1: Let's pause a second.  That beeping, well, the beeping is what, yeah.  Let's wait a second and then we'll just try to say that whole thing again (background noise).
Speaker 2: He's backing up, I guess, so.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Let's try that again.
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah, just, you were saying--
Speaker 1: It has a, you know, in all of science, there're, whatever, science and any other creative activity, whatever information you receive or is discovered, plays a role.  Now, how big a role is, that remains to be seen or to be proven.  What, what my discoveries did was to focus on what's called innate immunity, innate.  The humans have an innate system, and we have an adaptive system.  The innate system is around in all animals.  It appeared early in evolution and it stayed in humans.  The adaptive system related to these proteins that you're speaking about, the adaptive system appears only in vertebrate animals, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals.  So humans have the innate system and the adaptive system.  Now, what's the difference between the two?  The innate system is there for an immediate response.  If you receive a cut on your arm, that cut heals immediately, and you're not vulnerable to disease.  That's the immune system taking over, principally by, phagocytosis.  A bacterium gets in, the wound closes.  You have cells that migrate there.  They kill it, and the whole thing is over.  But a later component of the immune response in vertebrates, especially in humans, is the adaptive system.  And the adaptive system evolved later, and the adaptive system insists that you have to have antibodies.  And in order to have antibodies, it's a complex reaction between phagocytic cells and T cells and B cells which you don't have in, in the innate system.  It's not necessary.  Innate system is there for immediate action, take care of it, get it, get rid of it immediately.  The adaptive system, sometimes I question why it ever evolved.  I don't quite see the point because most of what I think we're challenged by is taken care of by this innate system, hit it immediately, and it's over with.  The adaptive system requires seven to fourteen days to develop, for these three different cell populations to talk to each other and say, okay, fine, we have to make this kind of antibody.  We have to make that kind of antibody, and then finally make it, and then do what it has to do.  It's a very complex system, and, again, I say I don't know why it evolved or what it evolved.  I think what my animals showed was that you can have survival without having this, this high powered antibody system, that it's--I, I still don't know why--

Speaker 1: And one question that I raise, and I haven't answered it, and a lot of other people, if humans have this extremely sophisticated adaptive system, how is it that we are essentially the only animals that get cancer.  And that's the scourge that's, everybody's worried about it.  Everybody's frightened of cancer.  And we know that it had something to do with the breakdown of the immune system, but we don't know why my earth- my earthworms don't develop cancer.  They live, some of them live up to ten years.  And then they get old.  I've done aging studies on them.  They get old.  They get the same kind of proteins like amyloid, which is a part of the aging process.  You look at aging humans, you'll see these deposits.  Earthworms get that, and then they eventually die.  But never once have I found cancer in, in, in my earthworms.  Yet, if you mix their cells with cancer cells, they kill 'em.  Now, we don't know, we don't know why the immune system of humans, with this, all of this sophisticated machinery, we cannot fight, we cannot prevent death from cancer.
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: And it's a fundamental problem, I think, in the immune system.
Speaker 2: So is cancer more prevalent among human beings than any other animal?
Speaker 1: I wouldn't say it's more prevalent.  (Laughter) It's more exciting and interesting to most people to look at it, but there's cancer in every vertebrate.  There's cancer in fish.  There's cancer in amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals, but those groups of animals are not of any immediate interests to humans.  You know, we- we're concerned more about our species than we are about other species.  I mean we're anthropocentric.  We worry about the human condition more than we do others.  And maybe that's okay, fine, that's what we do.  But it's not, it's not unique, and most people who look at the immune system, assume that it's unique to humans, and it doesn't exist anywhere, despite all that I've published and a few other people have published, the journal [Developmental and Comparative Immunology], the society [International Society of Developmental and Comparative Immunology] meetings, it's just relegated to, it still is not--it's not mainstream immunology.  What is mainstream that came out of ours is the discovery of the innate system.  That stuck.  Immunologists will recognize, but they still think that it's something that was found primarily in humans.  They never recognize that it was discovered in butterflies or honey bees or earthworms, you know, it's--but that's, that's the name of the game.  And so it's, sometimes, my, my interests and my work have been a lonely battle (laughter), trying to convince the, you know, the immunology world.  But it's okay now.  It's out, it's accepted.  It's not a problem.
Story_ID: 673307
Speaker 1: Well you had such a rich career here, I, I don't wanna miss anything, but in 1983, you're forty-seven years old.  You're the president of the American Society of Zoologists.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, you know, deep down from TSU [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas], Brown [Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island], I was always a zoologist.  I mean that's, that's what I like, that's what I am.  And I always stayed a member of the American Society of Zoologists.  And being, I don't know, perhaps overly ambitious, somebody said, "Well, why don't--," I was showing how we could get the comparative immunology into that society, get them to look at it.  So what I was doing came to the attention of the then officers.  Somebody suggested, "Well, why don't you help us organize meetings for ASZ, the American Society of Zoologists."  Well, there's nothing better in my life than asking me to organize something (laughter).  When I--I used to organize the neighborhood kids around doing this kind of stuff too at a very, very early age, you know, not playing baseball, but climb trees to go find bird nests and get the eggs, and take a look at them and that kind of thing.  It's been around a long time.  This is not anything new.  So what I did was to run for the office of program officer for the American Society of Zoology.  And so the job was if I won, I would have to organize sessions for about seven sub-societies within the American Society of Zoologists, the behaviorists, the neurologists, the embryologists, all the, the sub-societies.  So I won that, and, of course, used that as an opportunity to stick immunology (laughter) in there because they didn't have it.  And so I thought, here you go, Cooper [HistoryMaker Edwin Cooper], here's another chance, do it.  So I did that, and that was successful, so I held that office for three years.  Somebody said, "Look, you need to, let's run, let's put you up as a candidate for the presidency."  I said, well, of course, "Oh, fine, wonderful."  So I was running against a comparative endocrinologist.  She lost and I won.  So that's how I became president of the American Society of Zoologists and what I did, you're the president-elect, president and past president.  And for the past president, you give a speech at the national meeting.  And I did something which I had always wanted to do.  I stayed in contact with the professor who got me the contract or--he was at Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California], the contract to do the comparative immunology book ['Comparative Immunology,' Edwin L. Cooper] and I asked him the favor to introduce me at the national meeting.  And he did that.  I mean he- we were very close friends.  And so that was my--I used it as an opportunity.  I set up a committee when I was president to look at affirmative action, another committee called, it was, I thought past presidents were just sent out, so to speak.  After you were, after your presidency, it's like retiring.  Well, what do you do?  So I said, let's do something for retired presidents.  So I created a committee called the policy committee, and I said, your job will be to sit back from your experiences in the past, from where we're going in the future, your wisdom, what can you do as a member of the policy--so now that's an established committee within that society, long since then that I set up.  Well, it's not a backbreaking kind of job, but it at least gives us something to do, something to think about, some idea we had that inexperienced people don't have, and we can say, "Okay, let's do this."  And then it gets funneled through there for that particular society.  And the same with the affirmative action committee.  I don't know, I think it's called diversity or something like that now.  But it started out with my affirmative action idea.  And anything I proposed when I was president just went straight through, with no problem whatsoever, and I think the society is richer as a result.  Since then, it's grown, and it's now called the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology.  It's no longer called the American Society of Zoologists.  Why?  Because zoology, zoology gives the connotation of something that is old fashioned, out of reach, out of touch, and we wanted something that was more encompassing.  Every time they spoke about zoology, they would think, oh, well, it's, I don't know.  It's ants and worms and frogs and let's make it a little wider, and therefore, more relevant, perhaps more easy to get funding.  If we open it up and don't restrict it to primitive animals.  We weren't restricting it to primitive animals, but name changes can do a lot for a society or a group or an institution.  And so that's why we changed the name.

Speaker 1: In '85 [1985], now, the iden- the identification for genes for the T cell receptor (background noise) was made by Leroy Hood.  What, how did the--how does the identification of the T cell receptor affect your work?
Speaker 2: Well, I know--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Can you wait until after it's done, please?
Speaker 2: Tell me when.
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: Yeah, T cell receptor work.
Speaker 1: T cell receptor, well, this goes back to the earthworm work and tries to incorporate the ideas of mammalian immunologists, tried to adapt those ideas to my earthworm models, since I had shown that they could be looked at experimentally by rejecting transplants.  Well, the rejection of a transplant in humans is generated primarily by T cells, cells that originate in the thymus.  So I thought, okay, if my earthworms will reject grafts, is it possible for me to demonstrate that they have T cells?  Well, I tried and I had some circumstantial evidence, evidence that was primarily microscopical, but never chemical, that they could show the presence of a small population of cells that were T cells.  But I, I've backed away from that idea now.  And my view is that you have a group of cells that will kill cancer cells like T cells and other cells in humans, but they are not by all other, a lot of other criteria, they are not T cells.  And I don't wanna stick, I don't see why they have to be necessarily.  They are, they're killer cells, which are T cells, but they are the earthworms' killer cells and not necessarily T cells.  Now, you have them in vertebrates like fish and amphibians but remember, earthworms are much older in evolution, and they possess vestiges of what we have, what we and other vertebrates have, but not always the exact equivalent.  They have a brain, and they have hearts, and they have kidneys, but they don't, they're not quite like ours.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay, now--
Speaker 1: Lee Hood, by the way, has since, Lee Hood now has left Caltech [California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California].  He's, he's with the world's foremost authority on systems biology.  He's left experimental work altogether now.  I remember when he was at Caltech, though.  I know, we knew each other.  I know, I know who he is, but--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --in Seattle [Washington].
Story_ID: 673309
Speaker 1: Okay, now, in 1986 [sic. 1985], you co-published an article called 'Purification and Characterization of an O-Acetylsialic Acid-Specific Lectin for the- from Marine Crab Cancer Antennarius' ['Purification and Characterization of an O-Acetylsialic Acid-Specific Lectin from a Marine Crab Cancer Antennarius,' M.H. Ravindranath, H.H. Higa, E.L. Cooper, J.C. Paulson].
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't know how they grabbed onto that.  That's, I don't know.  That's not so interesting to talk about, I don't think--
Speaker 1: It's not, okay.
Speaker 2: It's, I wouldn't, I think it was published with one of my Indian colleagues.  Yeah, I don't, it's fine, it's an observation.  But I don't think there's any major significance to it.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, we'll skip past it then (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: In '89 [1989], you served as the vice chairman of the department of anatomy and cell biology here at UCLA School of Medicine [University of California, Los Angeles School of Medicine; David Geffen School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2: Yeah,--
Speaker 1: And I think, yeah, we kind of discussed that out in the, when we were getting coffee, right, about--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I can just fill in just a little bit on it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, sure.
Speaker 2: I was always a member, oh, through the chancellor's office, on graduate education, STEM [science, technology, engineering and mathematics], this department, on the committee, and at one point, I saw where I wanted to do something else other than just serve on the committee in this department for graduate education, that is, looking at the applications and viewing them and doing things like insisting that graduate student applicants need not necessarily have the highest scores on graduate record exams [Graduate Record Examinations] because I'm a, I think a lot of people can't take examinations very well, especially, these standardized tests.  And it's, it was used at one time as a criterion, but fine.  I don't think it should be the sole criterion for acceptance.  And so the department thought this was a good idea, and so I became the vice chair, and my job was to take care of graduate students and postdocs [post doctorate] in the department.  I kept that position for four years and decided then that I didn't want to go further in administration to think about becoming the chair of the department, and maybe a dean and then ultimately, president.  I just didn't want that kind of so called responsibility--or no, it's not so-called.  It's a responsibility, a certain amount of prestige that goes along with it.
Story_ID: 673310
Speaker 1: But I've had my share of important positions, and I preferred those than one that's localized and having to deal with trivial problems like, like noise outside or serious problems like two students--and I'd like to tell you about those.  One of them, I was the only person who successfully persuaded a student to finish his Ph.D.  He--the person with whom he was working couldn't do anything more with him.  And I said, "Okay, well, let me see what I can do."  He promised to finish it, which required just a little bit of rewrite and promised to sign (cough), excuse me, sign the document saying that he had finished, turn it in, and he would have his Ph.D.  Well, I said to the others, "He's done it."  They said, "Well, what a miracle."  Well, the big disappointment was, it came twelve o'clock at, one night, and then the day was over, and we never saw him again, which was, (laughter) I could never understand sometimes how students behave.  So this was a, this was something that I wasn't happy with, but what could I do about it?  I did everything possible, more than any others, got him to the point of signing it--he skipped out and didn't do it. Another situation was that I had a student who wanted to commit suicide.  And I had to try and figure out, now, what do I do with her now?  How do I handle this?  So that was a kind of crisis.  And then another crisis was to dismiss my then administrative assistant or secretary.  And that case went all the way to Berkeley [California] and lawyers came here, and I had to create a paper trail that thick 'cause it's very difficult to dismiss a person.  It was then.  I don't think it's that difficult now.  It's--it's not very nice now, the way administrative people are.  That, that can't happen to faculty members, but an administrative person, you can walk in the office I think now and just dismiss them, go through the drawers, take out the computers and out.  It's, I think that can be--that's--we've seen it done.  Anyway, so the lawyers came from Oakland [California].  Our UC [University of California System] office was in Oakland.  And they came.  They said, "Oh, listen, Professor Cooper [HistoryMaker Edwin Cooper], you have no problem.  This is--don't worry."  And I was really quite nervous about it because the, the--she made the case that it was ageism that I was against older women, so sexism and age (laughter).  And so I had ask then, the head administrator who was a woman, who was not so young, I said, "Can you gather all the information about the women in our department who are of a certain age, and obviously, women, so it's females."  So she did, and everybody was, a lot of older women.  So she had really not a case.  She was just not very good, and I had thought she was not good, and the others encouraged me to do what I could to.  So those experiences just said to me, I don't wanna do this.  I don't wanna spend a good portion of my life putting out those kind of fires.  So I never, I never aspired to go past the vice chair of this department and on maybe to become a dean.  Oh, I, I didn't want it.  And it's certainly too late to decide to do that now.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Not too late, but I don't wanna do it.
Speaker 2: I understand.
Story_ID: 673311
Speaker 1: All right, can you address the 1991 discovery of the role of peptides for the MHC class II structure?
Speaker 2: Okay, this was done, this was the study that was done with a colleague from France, carrying on this work of the, the earthworm again.  And I, this was a hot topic that started to appear in the mammals.  So here I go again trying to find an analog or a homologue or a similar situation in a primitive animal, my favorite one, the earthworm.  So I did the work with a postdoc [post doctorate] who came from France to spend--he wanted to spend at least a year, but he spent a longer time than that during that time.  And we put together a paper which identified a component of the MHC, which is the major histocompatibility complex.  That component is called Beta-2 microglobulin, Beta-2 microglobulin, Greek beta, sub 2, microglobulin.  And we found evidence for the existence of that molecule which is a part of the MHC.  We found it on the small cells in earthworms, which was kind of a, that was as exciting as showing graft rejection for its time because it suggested that there was a population of cells that I had shown previously, would kill human cancer cells, that that same cell type had this marker on the surface.  And so if you're gonna get at mechanisms, it's not enough to say, "Well, it looks like this."  You've got to use more evidence.  You have to show the existence of certain molecules in association with membranes, our external or internal membranes.  The more you can do that, the more information, the more evidence you have for your case, the question.  And so we found that that was a--and we published in the European Journal of Immunology, which was a--which was and still is, a prestigious journal.  And the fellow who did it came to spend, oh, one year, one full year, and then came back off and on several years after that, from France to work with me.
Story_ID: 673312
Speaker 1: Now, in--you published a number of works in the mid-'90s [1990s], two books here.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The Developmental- 'Developmental Immunology' [Edwin L. Cooper and Eric Nisbet-Brown] which was published in '93 [1993], is that true?  And 'Immunology of Anilines' [sic. 'Immunology of Annelids,' V. Vetvicka, P. Sima, E.L. Cooper, M. Bilej and P. Roch] in '93 [1993]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I can answer the second one quickly and rapidly.  I had a chance with a group in Prague in what was then Czechoslovakia, but now is the Czech Republic.  They were working on earthworms, and I, and this other young fellow from France, and those in Prague were also working on earthworms.  And I had the idea to go to a publisher and all of us get together who were working on earthworms, just to publish on that, on the immune system of earthworms.  So we got a, I got a contract.  I forget the publisher now.  I got a contract, and we, we, we published that.  And one of the pioneers, he was about my age, but he died very early.  We dedicated that book to him.  He was a pioneer in the Czech Republic then.  And so we became friends and he, we dedicated the book to him.  Now, the other one that you mentioned is 'Developmental Immunology.'
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: To be perfectly honest, that, that (laughter), I've forgotten what was the essence of that book (laughter).  I don't--
Speaker 1: Well, there's another one in '94 [1994] called 'Primordial Immunity' ['Primordial Immunity: Foundations for the Vertebrate Immune System,' G. Beck, G.S. Habicht, E.L. Cooper and J.J. Marchalonis].  Do you remember that one?
Speaker 2: Do you have the publishers down there?  Maybe that'll jog my memory--
Speaker 1: No, I don't--
Speaker 2: --'cause they're on my book shelf in my office, but if you know (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I don't have the publishers there, but--
Speaker 2: No?
Speaker 1: --'Developmental Immunology' and 'Primordial Immunity' came out in '94 [1994], it says here.  Then you edited two chapters that appear in the (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I am sorry.  But if I were in my office, I could--I have one shelf where all of these are lined up.  So I could tell you immediately, but I cannot--to be perfectly honest, I cannot answer those.  They're there, and I did it, but, sorry.
Speaker 1: So you spent a lot of time writing, I guess, that's the point of this.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: A lot of time writing.
Speaker 1: So, research, and then you're actually writing and publishing your findings (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, sure, because I felt that the world needed a, needed an advocate, and it fell into my lap to do it.  Some others, I've got other colleagues who also wrote, but never as persistently and I'm being modest now, never as persistently and as often as I have, have done it.  I've seen opportunities, and I just go after them because it's needed.  It's needed to inform my colleagues.  It's needed to inform others.  It's, it's essential.  Otherwise, what's the point of doing the work if you don't, if you don't allow your own world, and the outer world to know about the essence of what you're doing?  It's, it's, it's essential.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: And I have published a lot and still do.  I have, I have one paper now--we can come to that later if you'd like.  And I don't know if you've seen it, but, well, maybe I shouldn't--I don't know if you want me to bring that one up now.  I have three very important papers that have just come out recently.
Story_ID: 673313
Speaker 1: I'm in the mid-'90s [1990s] now, and I just wanted--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: --I wanted to ask you about toll-like receptors, TLRs?
Speaker 2: Yeah, this is a problem that's related to, oh, the concept of transcription, carrying an antigenic stimulus inside of a cell and it has to be done by molecules called toll-like receptors.  Well, again, this was my chance to try and see if such existed in earthworms.  And I had completely, I had no money to do this, but always my luck is that somebody comes along at the right time, who needs, let me say this, who needs my help.  A younger person or a person in some other country who is not, has no money, and I seized an opportunity to--for the discipline, for the student or the colleague and then for myself too.  I mean it's three reasons why I go after it.  It's, it's not entirely selfish at all.  I don't, I don't need it for my career, but it helps, helps the discipline.  So this came via a young investigator.  We published about three minor papers.  He's at a college here.  And he wrote to me, and he has the students, the young students--I don't have any young students interested in getting in a lab.  First of all, I don't have a lab anymore because we can't get any money to establish a lab, to occupy the space.  That's just the way that it is.  And so this came about, I suggested to him, well, let's do the toll.  So we've published some good preliminary papers on toll-like receptors.  The existence of components, it's in a complex molecule.  You don't know how complex these systems get until you start to do the chemistry and the physics of them, and then they become so, so complex with new technologies that the world just opens up something new every time, every time, every time (gestures), you have something new to look at and to look, go after.  And so, toll-like receptor is one of the more recent ones.  That's more, a little bit like T-cell receptor, but more refined, a little bit like the MHC [major histocompatibility complex] component, more refined.  But it's, it's endless, absolutely endless, what you can discover and find.
Speaker 1: Okay, what would you consider to be the major milestones in the evolution of the immune system?
Speaker 2: Well, of course, I will be as objective as possible, but I'm gonna be partial too.  I think a major milestone was to demonstrate that, demonstrate that the immune system had a, had a, had an old origin, that it evolved, that it just didn't appear overnight in humans, that it had a long evolutionary history, a long evolutionary history.  I think that's a, that's a major milestone.  And that's being as objective as I can about it, but it's also focusing on some of the, some of my own contributions to--to that understanding and that discipline is that it had a long evolutionary history.  It just didn't appear overnight in humans, (claps hands) very simple.
Story_ID: 673314
Speaker 1: Now, nine- 1997, you co-published a paper entitled, 'Clavanins, A-helical Anti-microbial Peptides from Turnicate' [sic. 'Clavanins, Alpha-helical Antimicrobial Peptides from Tunicate Hemocytes,' I.H. Lee, C. Zhao, Y. Cho, S.S.L. Harwig, E.L. Cooper and R.I. Lehrer]--
Speaker 2: Tunicates, yeah, okay.
Speaker 1: Turnicate--
Speaker 2: Tunicates.
Speaker 1: Tunicates, oh, yeah, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, this was done--this is tunicate, T-U-N-I-C-A-T-E-S.  Well, first, let me define the animal, and then I'll tell you how that came about here.  Tunicates are the marine equivalents in complexity to earthworms.  But they live in the ocean.  If you go down to the docks, people where they park their boats, their yachts, along the wharfs, you can sometimes see projections from the wall that look like barks of a tree.  This usually is a tunicate.  If you look at their cells of their immune system, they are very much like the cells in earthworms. They are very much like our cells, but the importance of this animal is, is that in evolution, there were two prongs in evolution.  One line led off to humans via sea stars, via tunicates.  Then you had vertebrates developing from that tree.  Then on the other tree, you had snails and earthworms, and animals like that which some will say was dead end because it didn't lead to the evolution of humans which was on that other side.  So I had spent essentially all my life looking at the, the earthworm's response.  But in order to convince myself and others that there was a relevance to looking at an invertebrate animal, I thought, well, take a chance and then do some collaborative work on tunicates.  And I've done a lot on tunicates, not only earthworms, but a lot on tunicates with different investigators.  But the specific paper that you're talking about now was done with a friend, colleague here at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], who is an M.D.  And he got, he's a rheumatologist, he's in inflammation.  Inflammation happens in invertebrates.  So he got interested in it.  So he, he pioneered with this clavanin work.  And so we collaborated because he knew of my worm work.  So it was a natural, natural collaboration.  I haven't published with him--I published about three papers with him.  He's now, he's now retired.  But those were, those were important papers.  And there're molecules that are components of the tunicate immune system.  And their immune system is as sophisticated as the earthworms because they're about the same level of evolution, but a different line that led to vertebrates and ultimately, humans.
Story_ID: 673315
Speaker 1: Now, during the '90s [1990s] your research included opioids, invertebrate cy- cytokines.  Is that pronounced, cyto- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, cytokines, opioids and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Invertebrate cytokines, polychlorinated biphenyls.
Speaker 2: Biphenyls, yeah.
Speaker 1: Biphenyls, yeah, PCBs or--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the '90s [1990s], let me focus more on the PCBs.  These are pollutants found in the environment.  And there was a young fellow at the University of North Texas in Denton [Texas] who was interested in environmental problems.  So what better animal to look at the environment of the soil or earth than the earthworm that lives there.  They live well.  They've got a good immune system.  So he contacted me, and said, "Oh, I'd like to come out and visit you, meet you and see if we can't create a collaboration."  So I said, "Oh, well, of course (laughter), please come."  So he came and we published about four papers on the effects of PCBs, which are, I don't understand them too well there, at the chemistry of them.  Apparently, they're waste products from refrigeration and that can get into the environment, eventually get into the soil.  And what better animal to see what the effects are than the earthworm that lives entirely, its entire life in the soil.  So they could be a monitor of changes in the immune system as a result of exposure to environmental pollution.  So we did a series of studies together, one of which was quite nice.  And that was to show that if you mixed the cells of the earthworm with PCBs--one of them was called Aroclor 554 [Aroclor 1254] or something like that.  You mix it, take a look at the scanning electron microscope.  You've seen these.  Scanning electron microscopes shows its images in 3D.  The transmission electron microscope shows the inside but at high power.  So you've seen on the cover of, oh, let's say National Geographic, the head of an insect, blown up and it's in three dimension.  This is SEM, scanning electron microscopy.  So we did a scanning electron microscopy of these same little cells that killed grafts in earthworms, exposed and not exposed to PCBs.  Not exposed, they throw out their--oh, they're quite active alive, and alive.  On the other hand, one exposed to PCBs, they're completely withdrawn.  They're round.  They don't show any activity.  So just on structural basis, we showed that there was a difference in that particular cell population, which was a more interesting finding.  And what it did for us, it boosted me back by him, boosted me back into the competitive market for getting grants because all of a sudden the National Institute of Environmental Health [National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences], which is located in, I think it's in Durham [North Carolina].  It's a part of the, you've heard of it, the Research Triangle in Durham.  I think it's there.  It may have been moved down into Bethesda [Maryland] where all the rest of the institutes are.  But it was an up and coming institute.  And so our stuff came in at the right time, and we got some small funds.  I let him manage it so he could, 'cause it was his ideas, and so I didn't have to get involved with it.  But, well, I went back to Texas and dropped off to see my family (laughter) while I was there, and then head up to Denton or vice versa.  And he would come here, and we'd write by mail.  But since then, we don't have a, we haven't had any contact for several years now.  Nothing went wrong.  It's just that, you know, you--research and relationships run their course, nothing, not a problem, but--
Story_ID: 673316
Speaker 1: Now, you did some research on leech leukocytes too, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Okay, you really have gone over my (laughter) my CV [curriculum vitae].  You've seen everything.
Speaker 1: As a historian, who reads a lot about 19th century, you hear about doctors applying leeches to patients, and you're saying, oh, they didn't know what they were doing or these idiots, you know, and--
Speaker 2: Well, you've done your assignment.  You've done your homework because that's what they are.  And let me tell you about that.  There's a group in Italy--this took, this idea I had took me back to Italy again.  They are known for their work on leeches.  Well, why leeches?  And why was I interested in leeches?  Because leeches are kind of first cousins to earthworms.  Okay, so you have the annelids, which are segmented worms.  There's the earthworm, which you've heard about today.  There are leeches, and then there's another group that lives only in the ocean.  And I have looked at, now, I've looked at all three.  I haven't published so much at all on the one in the ocean for various reasons, and that's another whole story, (gesture) and I won't get into that.  But I found a group in Italy that was working on leeches, but they were doing, oh, work that was not related to the immune system.  So I wrote a letter, I said, you know, "You know my work.  I'm interested in the immune system.  I'd love to come and spend some time with you, and let's just do some work on the leech immune system."  So we did grafts, of course.  I could do that, learned how to anesthetized them.  It's not the same as handling earthworms.  I mean it's a whole different kind of animal system.  So we did that, and showed that they could also destroy transplants which is what I predicted that they would do.  But they're a whole different kind of animal all together.  They're mostly semi-parasitic.  That's why they're used as, you know, for sucking blood.  They're, they're yeah, they're used for that.
Speaker 1: I think in the 19th century, weren't they applied to infected tissue and there seemed to have a--
Speaker 2: Well, that's, yeah, you're partially right.  It's the leeches, but it's also larvae from flies that will do that.  And I've got a colleague--
Speaker 1: Maggots, yeah.
Speaker 2: Maggots, you've heard of that.  Well, there's a colleague at U- University of California, Irvine [Irvine, California] who raises these, and he ships them all over the world.  And they have now been accepted as a medical device.  I think the FDA [U.S. Food and Drug Administration] will not call them leeches.  They call them a medical device.  So they're accepted, and they're used, especially, if people with diabetes, if it goes too far, where they have to have an amputation, sometimes they're used--I'm speaking about the fly larvae now for--
Speaker 1: Oh, maggots, okay.
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the--
Speaker 2: They're used for wounds that don't heal rapidly, and they put those on, and these will, they will eat dying tissue.  Historically, it was discovered--you mentioned 19th Century, so you've probably read the same thing.  Napoleon [Napoleon Bonaparte] used these out in the battlefield with soldiers whose wounds could not heal and the flies they saw would go to dead, dead animals, chewing away at dead flesh.  Well, the other component that's important is that the fly larvae, like the earthworms or like all invertebrates, secrete what's called anti-microbial peptides.  These are molecules that will kill bacteria faster than anything that we can produce, faster than antibodies.  We have some as well.  That's what I meant when I said earlier that the innate system gave--stayed in humans.  Thank god for that evolution that we got from flies and worms and all such animals.  We have anti-microbial peptides in our oral--in our saliva secretions.  So they are, they're very prominent.  Anyway, so the--that took--the leeches where we showed similar graft rejection--I published several papers with that group.  And then now, this--fly larvae, we didn't, I didn't publish anything on fly larvae.  But I encouraged this colleague at UC Irvine, to publish as much as possible and also to send papers to the new journal [Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine] that I started.  And you're probably gonna get to that later.  But that I saw was a kind of alternative medicine, an alternative therapy.
Speaker 1: Right, that's next on the list here in (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Okay, well, that kind of observation led me to focus that journal in association with the Japanese colleague, toward, toward CAM [complementary and alternative medicine], toward integrated medicine, toward alternative medicine, toward alternative sources of material that could benefit humans.  So leeches, bees, flies, fly larvae, all are part of that, that whole thrust.
Story_ID: 673317
Speaker 1: Bees?  Now, how are bees used?
Speaker 2: Yeah, bees, I used to collect them when I was lit- I figured out a way when I was a boy how to get bees and avoid being stung.  I used to take a clothes pin from my mother's [Ruthester Porche Cooper] wash (laughter).  I'd take a clothes pin, found, you know, see them flying over it on a plant.  I'd take the clothes pin and slowly open it up, and then gently open it and then attach it to the wing quickly.  And then I had the bee pinched in the clothes pin.  And that way, I could avoid being stung.  And I, well, I didn't know what to do with it after that, but at least I had invented a way to catch (laughter) bees.  The way the bees, now, this is, probably more fascinating than any study.  Bees have been around since the pharaohs in Egypt.  If you go look in the ruins and the pyramids and look around the walls of the pyramids, you'll see bees there, not only for the honey which also has anti-microbial properties.  In Europe, more than in the United States, they still stick to this old-fashioned remedy.  If you get a sore throat, take some honey.  Maybe we, some people do it here.  I, my mother never did that, but so a lot of people do that in the United States--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: That's right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --take some honey.  In Europe, you can go into a pharmacy and ask for propolis.  Propolis is a component that bees make, P-R-O-P-O-L-I-S, propolis.  When they're out looking for nectar, that's isolated.  That's the component that's isolated from bees that is anti-microbial.  Now, what did we discover that the bees have known for a long time?  In the hives, bees have eggs, they have larvae.  They have their pupa and then they have their adults.  It is essential that the hives, which are like a, they're like an incubator.  They're like a baby ward for their little eggs, and their larvae.  They have to be kept sterile.  Otherwise, the larvae and the eggs become infected.  Now, the bees in their heads don't know that, but we know it retrospectively.  So they, that's what they produce.  That's part of, related to the whole honey, is the hives stay sterile that way.  And we're exploiting it commercially by taking propolis.  So that's how they, they get involved with this alternative.  In addition, they produce a venom which has anti-inflammatory, anti-pain relief.  I have been in hospitals in Korea, visited clinics where bees' venom is used in acupuncture for people with arthritic knees and the pain is decreased.  Now, I cannot explain exactly the chemistry of the, what's in the venom.  Spiders have it, snake venom, if the proper snake or whatever.  It has some anti-pain properties, and it's being used, and it's used a lot in Korea for acupuncture.
Speaker 1: So it's, it's extracted it, 'cause you associate a bee sting or a spider bite, you associate it with pain and swelling, and that sort of thing.  Buy there's a component that numbs--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Anti-that as well, and that's been isolated, and it's used--I mean they don't, I guess back in the villages, thousands of years ago, they used to put a bee on there.  And they found that it worked, and so this has been handed down over the centuries.  But now, we've become sophisticated and we wanna know what's in it and how does it work.  That, I cannot, that I cannot explain, but I've encouraged people to publish in that journal on this.  It's a hot topic.  It's among the hottest of topics in alternative medicine for those who are interested in products, products from plants or products from animals.  You know, this field is big.  There's massage and then acupuncture and also, you know, yoga.  It's a big field.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I'm particularly interested though in these products that come from animals.
Story_ID: 673318
Speaker 1: So, in 2003, you were the founding editor in chief of Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine, right?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, this is a journal or a--
Speaker 2: Yep, yeah, it's a journal.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it's a nice story, and I can tell you about it, how it came about.  Well, you know, the, the first journal was called Development and Comparative Immunology [sic.].  That was all the work that dealt with the evolution of the immune system.  So, in two thou--I was, I was at a meeting in Japan.  And I was asked by the friend in Japan to start this journal.  And I said, "Me, start a journal based on complementary and alternative medicine?"  I said, "I know nothing about it."  So why do they want me to do it?  Because DCI, Developmental and Comparative Immunology was successful.  I had already shown that it was a successful journal.  So they said, "Well, we wanna start this, but we wanna push it."  Oxford University Press [Oxford, England] wanted to push it.  They said, "Who can we get to make sure it's gonna--," so somebody dropped my name, said, "Get Cooper [HistoryMaker Edwin Cooper], he'll fix it."  So that's how I was invited to start the journal.  I signed the contract, talked to the administrators who came from England to Japan to interview me, just like I'm speaking to you now.  And then when I walked out of the room, I thought to myself, what have I done?  I've gotten myself into, this is gonna be (laughter) the demise of my career.  I don't know anything about alternative medicine or complementary medicine.  I don't know--you know, I'm a biologist, a zoologist, biologist, biologist.  So I said, "Well, you've signed the contract.  You're gonna have to figure out what to or this is gonna be a monumental failure."
Story_ID: 673319
Speaker 1: So we were talking about the--
Speaker 2: The journal.
Speaker 1: --the journal for Evidence-Based (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, so I was faced with the dilemma of signing off on this contract with, I was enthusiastic about it, and like other challenges, I thought, well, you'll figure out how to do this and do it, do it right.  And so, I started to read more and more about the discipline.  And I saw plant products.  I said, okay, if plants make things, you know, good food, bad food, it's good for your health, why can't there be products from animals?  I started to read about products from animals.  Where did I go?  I headed straight back to earthworms again (laughter), and found out that they were used then and still now as components of this sort of alternative therapy.  And just recently, I published a big paper dealing with earthworm products and what they will do, as either whole extracts or this fluid that's in their cavity, can be used as adjuncts to health.  Now, how it's acting?  I'm not sure.  But that literature has gotten out.  I've had people call me on the phone, not every day.  One man calls, and he says, "I have rectal cancer," because he read about the killing of cancer cells that are earlier work that I've had.  And he said, "Can't you give me some stuff so that I can inject into my rectum, for my rectum?"  Well, I mean I was just completely taken aback by this, this kind of call because I- I'm not a clinician.  And besides, it's not a, it's just not feasible.  And why is it not feasible?  First of all, I can't do that.  I cannot okay that.  I'm not a clinician.  Second, this is such powerful stuff, this fluid that they produce that's probably killing the cancer cells in vitro, I don't know about the specificity of it.  So I can envision somebody taking it and then having the stuff kill every cell that it comes in contact with.  Well, you don't want that.  Chemotherapy already does that for a lot of populations.  I know I have a friend now, dying and I, I've had cancer, but I got it out before it went anywhere.  I never even had to have chemotherapy because the physicians who (unclear) in there--anyway that's another story.  Well, I can just envision saying, oh, yeah, I'll grind up some earthworms and give you some fluid, and you swallow that, and you'll be all right.  I could never do that because it just has not been carried far enough now to know how specific can it go and target a cancer cell and kill it and not kill everything else in your body.  That's the big challenge--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --whether it's with earthworms or any of these chemotherapeutic agents that are around, what, will it do that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: So, the difference between--yeah, I'm just saying there's not, there's no evidence.  So, I mean the name of your journal is Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine, so--
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 1: --so without the evidence, there's no (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, and the reason why we kept that name is because this field is very, very old.  If you go, especially to Ch--I've examined it now in cultures like China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam.  I've been there at a lecture once.  China, Korea, Japan, Vietnam and the Middle East, and to some extent in the United States also.  Our Native American cultures used this.  It's everywhere.  Everybody was interested in finding something to prolong their lives to take care of them during illness before the invention of the pharmaceutical house.  Pharmaceutical houses have not been around a long time.  And they have gotten, they have obtained their products from what we're talking about now.  Some of them were probably trouping around in Brazilian jungles looking for, for potential products.
Speaker 1: But we've had like apothecaries for years, people that--
Speaker 2: You're right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --have substances for sale that, but, that they say will, have been said to have cured something.  But as--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: You're right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --a scientist, you're dealing with--you want to deal with evidence based alternatives.
Speaker 2: I want, it has to be evidence based.  And so to have it evidence based, one of the best ways is to have an animal model like a rat or a mouse and do such studies on them or do some studies in vitro.  Take the cells out of humans, particular cells, put those in culture and then subject them to this and then see what will happen.  That's evidence based.  But to say, oh, I have sniffles.  Well, swallow the extract from ten earthworms, and you'll get well, this is, this is not science.  This is hocus pocus.  It's a old wives' tale.  It's folk tales, and, you know, I--this won't work.
Story_ID: 673320
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this, though.  So, what, what extracts from earthworms or secretions of earthworms are used in alternative medicine?
Speaker 2: Good thing you ask 'cause just before you did, it popped into my mind if he does ask this, I've gotta tell him about this.  The way that this earthworm fluid probably acts in- in vitro, which I had shown long ago, it acts like an enzyme, a potent enzyme that will destroy anything it comes in contact with.  This has been exploited.  I didn't do it, but if you Google earthworm, and you Google it right, you can come up with a product called lumbrokinase, L-U-M-B-R-O-K-I-N-A-S-E, lumbrokinase.  Lumbrokinase is in essence, an extract from earthworms which will dissolve clots, blood clots.  You see, we've already talked about it dissolving other stuff or killing other stuff.  Well, the same principle is applied.  It will dissolve blood clots.  So there is something on the market now called lumbrokinase. It's patent name is Boluoke--B-U-L-U-O-K-E [sic.], Boluoke, the patent name.  It's sold in China.  It's sold in Canada.  And this is a legitimate product that's derived from earthworms.  I didn't do it.  Sometimes, if you read some of the papers associated with it, you might see one or two of my papers cited in it, but my work started out with another aspect of--of earthworms.  Whenever there's a paper related to this, that's being submitted to other journals, invariably I have to--the journal asks me to review them.  Now, there's one fellow now--there's two.  There's one in China, in Beijing, and it's gotten to be a hot topic.  And then here, again, (laughter), I guess I'm--these young people now are catching on to it in various places.  There's a fellow in Beijing who is isolating the gene that controls the development of this particular molecule in earthworms, to show you how complex.  I talked about Beta-2 microglobulin and a couple of other molecules in earthworms.  All of these are gene determined, like any gene that we have.  You know, skin color, eye color, hair texture, all of this is gene controlled.  Everything is ultimately referable to genes.  Well, they're now working on--there're about three, four, five labs working on the genes that control the development of this lumbrokinase.  Well, what they wanna do is, they wanna hone in specifically on the specificity of lumbrokinase because apparently, it will dissolve clots, but it'll dissolve a few other things, even though it's out on the market.  So you wanna, you wanna target blood clots, you know, that cause heart attacks or brain problems, you wanna target those rather than having it become a general systemic kind of drug 'cause that's--I think that the lumbrokinase, I think it's--nobody suffers anything bad from it.  I've never read about it, and it's out on the market.  Surely, it's doing something.  I don't have to take it, and maybe if I had to take something like that, I would.  But I don't have to take it for any--I'm not ill at the moment.  But that's one molecule.  It's called lumbrokinase.
Story_ID: 673321
Speaker 1: To show you where all the forces of using this animal, the earthworm, gave me the impetus to go on and do this journal [Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine], I said, ah-ha, now, I have a reason for doing it.  I have an interest in it.  I can push the journal and make a success out of it.  And now, it is successful.  It's the highest ranking journal of twenty-two journals by impact factor in integrated medicine.  I mean it's not on earthworms, but it's on the whole field.  And it got to the stage where it was too expensive for my Japanese friend to support it.  He didn't have enough funds because it was growing, growing, growing.  Oxford University Press [Oxford, England] said to me about five years ago, either you sell it or you let it die or you have to buy it yourself or find another publisher.  So I had been talked into signing the contract by an executive at Oxford University Press who helped me, oh, with one of my books.  And I said to him, "Look, Martin [ph.], you got me into this with this, with other things and with this journal.  So, now, it's doing so well," I said, "you go out and find another publisher," I said, "because I don't know how to navigate this, the dealing with publishers.  They, they come to me, and that's that.  So I don't know how to find--."  So he said, okay, so we looked around and found three publishers.  One was in England, another one is called--and you have to take this term down.  It's P-L-O-S, Public Library of Science, P-L-O-S Public Library of Science.  It started out supposedly as a free journal to publish in, but now it costs.  Then another one was called the British Medical Journal.  That was one.  And then the other publisher was Hindawi [Cairo, Egypt], which was published or is published in Egypt.  So I looked at the three of them.  He said, well, look, this is what I found.  And I recommend these.  The first thing I looked at, all three of them, authors must pay to publish.  I looked at the three.  Hindawi, which is the name of the one in Cairo [Egypt], was the least expensive.  I think it costs seven hundred, excuse $750 per accepted paper, which is the way that papers are going now because it makes them open access.  Anybody can get access to them.  But if you don't, if you're a part of an institution that doesn't have a contract for a journal, you can't get to it.  But with an open access journal, which the authors have paid, anybody can open up, and you can go and look with no problems.  So I chose Hindawi for two reasons.  It was the least expensive and because I spent a year in Egypt.  And I thought, oh, maybe I'll get to go back to Egypt again because I liked being there, very, very much.  And so I took that one.  I think it costs then seven hundred dollars.  That was about four years ago.  It is now 1,750 [dollars].  And I took the least expensive because I thought, well, the people who are interested in this kind of discipline, it's not mainstream, it's complementary and alternative medicine.  Maybe they are not gonna have so much money.  We are overrun with papers.  We have about, which I advised Hindawi to do, I said, you need to develop special issues on one particular topic.  I said, let's do that, and you'll see.  We have about twenty special issues in progress.  Now, this is incredible, absolutely incredible.  So the cost of 1,750 apparently was no problem.  I was anticipating nobody coming to publish here because it's too expensive.  On the other hand, we're just overrun with people with all sorts of ideas about what can we publish, some on cancer, some on aging, and I'm on one for Pom Wonderful [POM Wonderful, LLC], this product from pomegranate.  I'm helping produce one for that.  Two others that are over there, that I brought in.  One was published, it's called 'Ethnobiology and Ethnopharmacology in Brazil'--or in Latin America [sic. 'Medical Ethnobiology and Ethnopharmacology in Latin America'].  So that's another one that I'm, that I have already published.  And then another one was related to biomolecules from the sea.  And I put together a group of Chinese for that one because of a meeting that was held in a marine station in northern China, again, using some of my own work as the model for, for starting that.  And so it's turned out to be really fortunate for me or fortunate for the field.  It's, it's another success story, this--and what led me into it, I started out in comparative immunology with my earthworms, and eventually saw how I could fit them into a bigger picture.  And, and I was able to do it because I certainly was not optimistic when I signed the contract with this journal, that it was gonna go anywhere.  I didn't know anything about medicine or about complimentary medicine or these old wives tales.  But it was in there, and I said, okay, this can be subjected.  So I'm quite happy about it.
Story_ID: 673322
Speaker 1: Now, does the, the journal [Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine] concentrate more on cures or is there a balance between cures and prevention in terms of--
Speaker 2: Good question, cures versus prevention.  It depends on the investigators and it depends on what they are, they're asking.  The main point is that it has to be evidence-based.  It has to be, you have to have controls.  And especially, if you're doing a certain kind of work where there're humans--first of all, you have to have permission from the institution.  That's, the Institutional Review Board has to look at the protocol and make sure that it's on the up and up.  Otherwise, it gets, the work gets rejected.  That doesn't even get to the journal.  So it has to be approved.  Yeah, and then you, if you have an invitro model, that's, that's all right.  It just has to show strong scientific basis.  Otherwise, it's just not acceptable.
Story_ID: 673323
Speaker 1: One of the, one of the friction points between, I guess, science and I guess, alternative medicine and popular culture and, and business, even in terms of legal and illegal business, seem to all collide on the issue of marijuana.  So, I mean we were down in Venice Beach [Los Angeles, California] the other day, and people dressed in lime green doctors' outfits are standing out in front of places selling marijuana.  It's like a carnival down there.  Well, what are your thoughts about that?
Speaker 2: About marijuana?
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the legalization and the medicine benefits of it and--
Speaker 2: If there are medical benefits, I have absolutely no problem with it whatsoever.  I think it came up, I forget what, what--yeah, it came up as one of our issues to vote on in California.  And I certainly voted for it.  If it's perfectly all right, well, why not?  I mean we've legalized alcohol and cigarettes.  So, it can't be any more harmful than--than those.  And we have, what do we have, 10 percent alcoholism, everywhere, all over the world.  And people still are--I'm sorry, I can't, I can't block this.  If anything, it'll help this budget in California (laughter), anything to help the budget here, other than asking me and everybody else to buy more.  You know, buy more marijuana (laughter), if necessary, but--
Speaker 1: Okay, it--
Speaker 2: No, I'm entirely in favor of it.  And I should, you asked me that question, I should lo- do a search in the journal and see what we've, see what, if anything, we've published on marijuana.  I don't remember now.
Story_ID: 673324
Speaker 1: Is there any, any medicine that is on the horizon that you think is going to be, I guess approved by--
Speaker 2: FDA [U.S. Food and Drug Administration]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, FDA, to treat some chronic disease that we now are--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think probably the most pressing chronic disease is now- are those diseases of aging people.  This is a--we, ironically, we are doing a lot to prolong life, but then we don't know what to do with those people who- whose lives have been prolonged.  We don't know what to--and that may sound like a crude way to put it, but what do you do with your mother and your father who are ninety years old, refuse to go to a place where they can be taken care of.  They wanna be taken care of at home, or they, they say nothing is wrong.  And they are old.  They're not, they're incapacitated.  They need, they need help.  We don't have facilities for it.  And it's a paradox because on the one hand, we're prolonging life.  But then we don't know what to do with those we've prolonged.  I had a personal situation.  My, we lost our mother [Ruthester Porche Cooper] this year of ninety-five years old.  We put her in a, the best facility, and she was slowly dying there, refusing to eat, refusing to do everything.  We were accused of having abandoned her.  One sister took her in and prolonged her life for another five years.  She became a happy person and was perfectly all right.  The best thing that I would say is, can you take care of them, can you take care of them in their own surroundings.  It's much better.  But in order to do that, you have to have an infrastructure where you have visitations from healthcare people.  The best countries like that are in Europe.  The United States is way behind in terms of prenatal care, extra natal care, care of the aged.  We're, we're at the bottom of the list.  Go to a place like France, which I do, they--I think you have maternal leave for two years, job guaranteed when you go back or you have people who visit older people and take them food.  This summer, they had another heat wave there, like they lost--this caught them off guard, they lost, I think, ten thousand people during a heat wave in August.  Well, they didn't do that this year.  They had, the government sent out I don't know how many people with cold water and fans and everything, taking it to all these places where there were older people living.  We have to do something 'cause it's, it's a major undertaking now, what to do with, with older people?  We wanna stay alive, but you have to take care of 'em when they stay alive, and we're not making enough progress.  Now, the two diseases that--there's Parkinson's, and there's Alzheimer's.  To be personal, Alzheimer's probably is going to appear more in my generation of my own relatives because as I trace it back through my mother, it's some, it's--I think it's through her mother [Hannah Hughes Porche] and there's too much history of it, not Parkinson's.  Parkinson's was nowhere around.  But Alzheimer's through the women in my family is, I think, pretty obvious.  Parkinson's, my father had something that looked like some Parkinson's.  Now, the other thing is memory loss.  What are we gonna do about that?  So what drugs are we using for that?  To go back to Parkinson's, if you look in the brain, with these two diseases--I think it's Parkinson's, there's an accumulation of certain kinds of products called plaques in the brain which block nerve transmission.  And they're, they're developing some drugs for that, but I don't think we will ever get to the stage where we keep people alive forever.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know one alternative medical practitioner told me once that she had never lost a patient.  And I asked her, I said, do--so then, do these people live forever?  And she said, of course not (laughter).
Speaker 2: Immediately, of course not.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but--
Speaker 2: No I--but I think, you know, ultimately, in all of us, I mean I don't think anybody wants to die.  Now, maybe some people get to the stage where they're in so much pain, they want relief and death is their only relief.  But we need to be more, more realistic about it.  I certainly don't wanna go.  I'm perfectly healthy.  I certainly don't wanna go--I mean the world and life and doing things is too, too interesting.  But I can see how if a person doesn't have that kind of life, how they could be really bored, literally bored so that they just, you know, let it go.  They don't want to be bothered.  Fortunately, for my own, in my own case, in my mother's case, she just withered away and no pain, not alone.  So it couldn't have--at ninety-five years old, what are you gonna do?
Story_ID: 673325
Speaker 1: Another thing occurred to me, we were talking about loss of memory and aging and that sort of thing.  And as that relates to alternative medicine, do--is there any effort being waged anywhere in the world to--I know it must be, to interview people who have some knowledge of alternative medicine before they get away from here without sharing that information (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, when--it's an excellent question you're asking.  One, the last sabbatical that I spent, I spent it, I told you in, in Italy, mostly working in Modena [Italy].  By the way, that's where one of the famous fast cars is made.  Which one is it?  You have to name the kind--
Speaker 1: Fiari [sic. Ferrari] or the--
Speaker 2: What are the fast cars?  Lamborghini is one.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Lamborghini.
Speaker 2: And then there's another one.  One or both of them were developed in that city--
Speaker 1: Fiari and Lamborghini and it's probably some more.
Speaker 2: It's developed in that city and balsamic vinegar.  I don't know if you--I like balsamic.  I learned to like it there, in fact.  It's very dark, and true Italians that live in that town in Modena--the next time you go to the supermarket, look for Modena on balsamic vinegar.  That's where it comes from.  They will bring from their cellars like French do with wine, they'll bring a tiny little bottle like that of Balsamic vinegar that's a hundred years old, that's prized.  And they eat it on ice cream or on strawberries (laughter).  It's, it's vinegar, but it, it enhances the flavor of certain sweet things.  I've tried it on strawberries.  It helps them sometimes if they're too bitter.  Anyway, now, what was I about to tell you?
Speaker 1: We're asking about--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The head of the lab is interested in centenarians, and you've surely heard about centenarians.  Centenarians are people who live to be more than a hundred.  And one of the news fellows, he used to be the weatherman on NBC, Willard Scott--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Scott.
Speaker 2: --Willard Scott periodically introduces people who are more than a hundred years old and congratulates them and say they do this and they do that.  Well, the head of the lab where I was, he thought what I was doing with earthworms was great, that tissue culture and all that.  That was fine, but his primary interest was in centenarians.  He's published some of the best papers on centenarians, and the tie-ins at least in the southern part, a population that are known to live quite long.  And they, you've heard of the Mediterranean diet?  I mean I don't do it, I don't adhere to it because I've given up on certain kinds of things, which is a part of the Mediterranean diet.  But it's a lot of vegetables, a lot of, I don't know, pasta is probably in there.  Pasta's in everything they eat, a lot of vegetables though.
Speaker 1: Tomato sauce and (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but not so much the kind of refined sauce we have it.  They'll go and get fresh tomatoes and make it from that.  Then they, supposedly they have a social network which we've lost.  You know, they're living in the country.  And so they go from, they visit and they go from person to person and I--we've lost all, we've just become so industrialized.  You don't, what, what country town can you go to now and just visit or where people are really interdependent?  Apparently, that's, that has something to do with living longer, a certain sense of wellbeing with your surroundings.  I don't, I don't think we have that anymore.  Everybody migrated from the South, especially, from the South, yeah, because that's where the agriculture was, the South, the central part of the United States and--no, the central part, South and West is where it ultimately developed.  Anyway, the point is that the agricultural lifestyle, I think, was easier on people than it is now because agriculture is mechanized now.  I mean big farms, small farms don't do anything anymore, I don't think.  So we've just become so industrialized and so this and that, that we're, fine, we're prolonging life, but we're not doing anything about it to la- to really enhance it later on or to make it, make it a little bit more meaningful.
Story_ID: 673326
Speaker 1: So, in, in terms of these centenarians, are they being tapped for their information about how they--
Speaker 2: They're being published, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: This one, the head of that lab where I was, he's probably the big authority on centenarians.  And they do things, I mean he looks at their blood types, their immune systems.  They just, they examine them completely and thoroughly to see how they differ from, let's say from me, who's twenty-five years younger, you know.  How do I differ from those centenarians?  Now, down the road, I can see that probably I'm gonna have some difficulty (laughter) with memory now.  I don't know if I'm headed toward, toward Alzheimer's or what.  I strongly believe that it's in my maternal side of my family.  The ability to concentrate for a long time, the ability to recall.  That, that's lost as you age.  But a lot of things are lost as you age.  You know, it's not only that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so older people are being studied on the physiological level but I was asking also are they being interviewed in terms of what they know about alternative medicine and cures and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: That I'm not sure about.  I would think that they are.  And if anybody is doing it, it should be the head of this lab because when I started this journal, I put him on the editorial board immediately.  And maybe he published one or two papers.  And then we were sold from Oxford University Press [Oxford, England] to this new publisher [Hindawi, Cairo, Egypt].  So he's not on it anymore, but I wanted him on there right away because I thought this is another area that needs to be looked at.  And you've got an expert, and you hope that that expert will help recruit papers and then be responsible for editing or reviewing them, you know, from the science.  But it's--it's that and prenatal care and inner cities and that sort of thing.  All of these are terrible in the United States.
Speaker 1: Okay, I know there's a book that a black physician, a woman who went to Howard wrote, called 'Salt in Your Sock.'
Speaker 2: It's called what?
Speaker 1: 'Salt in Your Sock and Other Homemade Remedies' ['Salt in Your Sock: and Other Tried-and-True Home Remedies,' by Lillian Beard and Linda Lee Small] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Who is the name?  Who--
Speaker 1: I can't think of her name right now, but she--
Speaker 2: I've never heard of it.
Speaker 1: --she went to Howard medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.].
Story_ID: 673327
Speaker 1: Now, yeah, we were, during the break, we were talking about Aspirin and the origin of it, Aspirin--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, sorry.  I thought that was being recorded too--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: No, no--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --that's good stuff though (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, he asked a good question--Matthew [Matthew Hickey] asked a good question about, or answered a good question--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --about the origin of Aspirin.
Speaker 2: Yeah, no, I--so you took that off (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Unclear) Yeah, so it, so it's White Willow bark, right?  That's what it is?
Speaker 2: It's a bark.  I didn't remember exactly the name of the tree, but it's an, I know it's bark.  So what I'd like to say though is, imagine you have a headache.  So you've gotta go and find White Willow bark and then scrape it and do all sorts of things.  No, what do you do?  You go down to the drugstore, even the supermarket and get a bottle of Aspirin, and it works.
Story_ID: 673328
Speaker 1: Now, you're currently distinguished professor here at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Are you nearing retirement?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: I know you're getting closer, but I don't know how close you are.
Speaker 2: Okay, here's the stories on these.  I think after forty years, you, you don't have to do anything anymore.  Your salary comes from someplace else, but my entire life, I've never worried about salary.  Also, I've never worried about retiring because retiring means, sometimes, I say jokingly that I'm not tired, so therefore, why should I retire (laughter).  They don't have any relation.  I, I don't like to tell it, but you asked, and I'm being honest.  Officially, I am retired, but I don't like the word to get out because sometimes people who are retired, they're sort of banished, pushed aside, no more invitations, all sorts of things come along that I never liked, knowing what happens.  And so I never, I don't sign my name as emeritus, for example.  I still leave the title distinguished there which sounds better because lots of people get emeritus.  And the moment they see emeritus, they're, it's (scoff) scorn.  You know, you don't hear, though, there's a strong emeritus association, and when I say here, I mean UCLA.  I know it better than any other place.  There are lots of activities, lots of activities, lots of things.  So you can, you can carry on.  I am recalled for my research and for teaching.  I teach about the same as I did before--I don't teach medical students anymore, but I teach special courses for undergraduates, on a graduate course.  And my research, I'm still writing.  I mean I publish one paper now, which is the (laughter), it seems like it's the latest thing since, what, slice bread, they always say.  It's a highly theoretical, hypothetical paper that I just published in a new journal.  It's getting, before it was published for one month, it had one thousand hits of people looking at it in an open access way.  So, please don't put it down that I'm retired because nobody will wanna touch me anymore.  They'll say, oh, he's retired.  And it happened once.  Nine months after I officially did it, I got a prestigious invitation to go abroad, prestigious flight, which means business class, prestigious honorarium.  Six months later, the invitation was withdrawn, said, "Sorry, you can't come because we know you're retired."  And so all I did was pointed my finger at everyone who said, "Oh, you're retired."  I said, okay, you see what happens sometimes when you say that you're retired--and I never said anything.  I accepted the invitation and it came, and sure enough, it backfired.  I was infuriated.  I wrote that medical school, and I said, "How dare you do it.  You know, I mean, don't--my brain didn't shut off two years ago, and my enthusiasm didn't shut off two years ago.  So why should you do this to me."  And the little response was a profuse apologies, but it was too late.  And so I don't, I don't say it now.  It, somehow though, it gets in the wind (laughter), because people say, "Are you retired yet?"  Or isn't it about time, all sorts of subtle questions that I immediately get defensive and (laughter) and say, no, I'm healthy.  I'm fine, thank you very much (laughter).  So that's a way of answering you (laughter).  Don't--take that out of the record.  I don't want that published at all (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 673329
Speaker 1: Well, when you look back at everything you've done to this point--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and consider it, is there any major thing that you would go back and change or wish you hadn't done?
Speaker 2: Major thing that--no.  I wouldn't say that I'm, I'm--satisfied doesn't quite sound the right word, but I'm, I'm happy with my enthusiasm.  I'm happy that I've had good health or when I was threatened by potentially bad health, I knew how to take care of it early enough, didn't let it go on.  I don't know that, I don't know that I've been necessarily lucky.  I've gone after opportunities and figured out ways to exploit those opportunities for a discipline or any idea that would push my cause and also help other people in the process.  I can't do it alone.  And it's of no value for me to ever--what value is what I'm doing if it's not appreciated by somebody else or helps somebody else, students and--high school students or students or what--I mean I have to, it has to be a two way, has to be a two way street what I'm doing.  So I wouldn't do anything else over again at all.
Story_ID: 673330
Speaker 1: We, we always ask this question too.  When you consider once again, all your accomplishments to this point, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Ah, these are deep questions, these last two.  The legacy is, I'd like to be remembered as a generous human being.  I don't think that I've been selfish in what I've been doing, and that's--so, and how have I been generous because I think I've helped some, some people to become scientists everywhere, that all, whenever the opportunity came, I never flinched.  I went after it to help.  And I don't think I've exploited anybody in the process.  I think that my goals have been, have been noble, and so my--my legacy is, is that.  I've tried to write it down, but every time I wanna write it down, there comes an invitation (laughter) to write some science.  And I can't quite get off the ground to do it.  It's all there and stacked in CDs [compact disc] in various places.  And this is coming closer to anything that will ever get recorded and put away that's about.  Otherwise, you have to look in the journals about it.  But I, I'm, yeah, I'm, I'm pleased.  I'm pleased to have been so lucky in some respects.  But I have treated luck with ambition.  And it's not ambition that I learned.  It's not ambition that I was, that I exploited anybody.  Ask anybody who knew me when I was growing up.  I haven't changed any.  I'm just seventy, sixty, seventy years older, but I'm--what you see now is what I got, you know.  And I, children in my neighborhood didn't like to see me coming because they knew if I did, I'd take 'em out of, off the baseball field and sit 'em down, and we'd talk about bees and worms, you know (laughter).  Well, I didn't care anything about baseball then nor now.  Fine, it's a part of what we're all about, but that's, I mean the baseball players aren't doing what I'm doing, so why should I worry about them, you know.  So, fine, I'm--I'm quite, quite happy.  When I go, if I know when I'm going, I'll go happy.
Story_ID: 673331
Speaker 1: Now, tell us, now, now you've mentioned your wife [Helene Cooper] several times (background noise).  I know you probably talked about when you all met earlier.  I'm not sure.  I guess so.  But, you know, tell us something about your family.
Speaker 2: My family--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: You've got two children (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  My family, it's interesting.  I had all sorts of relationships (laughter) with, with females, dating and that, but the usual sort because we didn't advance.  I knew that I had some, some French ancestry.  This was always via my mother [Ruthester Porche Cooper].  My mother's grandfather [Pierre Porche] was French.  My mother's grandmother was, was a slave.  So I knew that.  And little did I know that I would end up marrying a French woman, which is what I did.  And it just happened.  I met her here in Los Angeles [California].  She had come to teach, to learn English and to teach French.  And we met, and something, something happened.  Her Visa ran out, and she went back to, went back to France and told her brother, who is--he's retired now, but he was a prominent obstetrician in France, told him about her.  And he said, "I think you should go back to Los Angeles immediately and look up this fellow."  He said (gesture), "He's gonna be okay."  So she came back, and then shortly thereafter, he came and quote (air quotes) interviewed me (laughter), went out to lunch.  And so the deal was sort of sealed.  And we got married.  We met in '69 [1969], is that right, February of '69 [1969].  We got married in September of '69 [1969].  And I took the first sabbatical in 1970.  When we came back, we were gonna have a child, and we couldn't live in the apartment where we were before we left.  And so I had bought some land when I came here.  That land served as a down payment for a house, which I used to buy a house.  Our children, our daughter is now forty years old.  She has a master's degree in family therapy, but--and has had a lot of health problems.  She then, she couldn't find a position as a family therapist.  So I suggested, why don't you do something fast track in the health professions.  So she became a, she's obsessed with helping people.  I mean both our children got that from the mentality of my wife but also from me, from another viewpoint.  Neither one of them are pure scientists, the children nor my wife.  But they, we had this--this feeling in our house that we have to, we're kind of lucky, and so our daughter lived in Berkeley [California] for a while and would give her last dollars, that we gave her, to people in the street, you know.  That was, and, both of them have done similar things to that, you know, cleaning up in Los Angeles after the riots and, with my wife and I, you know, I didn't, but they did.  So fine.  So she's now studying to be a vocational nurse.  Her husband is a social worker.  Our son lives in Washington.  Now, our son got the international travel bug, I think from me.  He's lived and worked in China.  He has a master's degree in political science.  He, his wife has done similar works.  He's in charge of security for an NGO [nongovernmental organization], travels a lot, mostly to the Middle East.  One of his first trips in this new position--I mean he works hard, really very hard.  He traveled to Afghanistan.  He has to--in places like that he's met by police guard.  I mean he has to travel under high security.  Where is he going--I think he's going to some African country soon.  I can't keep--I can hardly keep my own self (laughter) straight in my travel, let alone his.  He's going to two or three African countries soon and to South America also soon.  Our daughter is gonna finish up her licensed vocational nursing job which was something that my mother decided to do at a late period in her life.  She never had a chance like her older siblings to go to college.  And so she later on, when all of us started to school, my mother became a vocational nurse.  Well, my daughter's doing the same thing now.  So we, we're fortunate.  We have good health, although our daughter's had some health problems.  I've had some surgeries for health problems, but we're, we're all healthy, reasonably happy--
Story_ID: 673332
Speaker 1: I'm not a grandparent.  I'm not pushing it either (laughter) because I, in my opinion, our children are not--they're not my generation at all.  They're not, they're not grounded yet.  They're just not quite grounded.  And I, I tell them.  I wouldn't like to have a child now.  And I'm serious about that.  I think that my generation, we were growing up, regardless of where you grew up.  It was a generation of something that was special, something to, I don't know, reach for in many ways, more than now.  Things, there're more opportunities for everybody now, but somehow, I don't know, I think that we exploited them more than the current generation.  I think the generation is too attuned to, to the, to technology.  It's fine.  I'm not knocking it.  I love flying on planes and I like my, my computer.  But I don't want too much of it in my life.  I don't have a cellphone.  I refuse.  It's too much.  I don't, I'm not in Facebook.  I mean it's all I can do to handle Google and all (laughter).  I mean, what do I wanna get in Facebook for (laughter)?  So that's in a capsule what my family's like.  I've got brothers [Joe Cooper and Phillip Cooper] and two sisters [Hannah Cooper Lewis and Otha Cooper Barnes] in Houston [Texas] who I see often when--the last time was when my mother [Ruthester Porche Cooper] died, and we were all together then.  And then I did something I always wanted to do.  I went to the, where my mother is buried and a lot of her aunts and her father [Joseph Porche], her parents went to the tombstone of her grandmother, and I made a rubbing because her birth is recorded and her death is recorded.  But I have not yet found her parentage.  I don't know who her parents were.  I do know from my father's [Edwin Ellis Cooper] side, I've been able to go to Ancestry [Ancestry.com].  You've heard of that I'm sure, and find it.  But I cannot find her, the great grandfather.  I know--I mean the great-grandmother.  I know she was, well, she was a slave, but I don't know who her parents were.  And I, that's one, that's the last puzzle in my life (laughter), to find out-- where did she come from?  I know about my great-grandfather, my mother's grandfather.  It was a lot on him, a fair amount.  He was quite wealthy, and, but anyway, that's, that's a capsule about my family.
Story_ID: 673333
Speaker 1: Now, is there anything we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Do we need to talk about?  Well, you've asked me what is my legacy, how do I feel, or I don't know?  About myself or what I've done to help or whatever.  I've told you that, and I've told you enough about my family too, so you have an idea.  No, I don't have anything more.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, here's the last question.  It's similar to legacy.  In fact, it's almost the same thing.  Sir--
Speaker 2: Should I get ready (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Yes.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: How would I like to be remembered?  Maybe I've partially answered it already, and that's remembered as--I've heard it expressed before.  I mean he's really a nice man.  That's how I would like to be remembered.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Over and above the science, but the science helps too (laughter), but over and above the--a nice man.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Simply that.
Story_ID: 673334
Speaker 1: Okay, this picture shows one of my many undergraduate volunteers.  She was a student in the course that I teach for undergraduates.  She's very, very bright.  At the moment, I just heard from her.  She's now at a marine lab where she's studying regeneration in starfish, and following very much some of my earlier studies when I was at Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] and on to Brown University [Providence, Rhode Island].  And so we're in front of the medical school here at UCLA [David Geffen School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 2: What is her name?
Speaker 1: Clara Tsao, Clara T-S-A-O, Clara Tsao.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And this is about, oh, ten years old.  This is a picture of myself on my card which allows me to get into the, into the medical school at odd hours.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) (Simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, right, I'd better keep it because I can't get in on Saturdays and Sundays.
Speaker 2: This picture is taken in the far western region of China this past September.  I was visiting there for the first time.  Those--Buddhist temples that were noted for famous drawings.  They're at least a thousand years old. And that's my colleague, young colleague who was my host there at this university.
Speaker 1: They invited me there.  Here he is again.  This is in Chinese and also in English.  This was a picture, poster over the entire campus, all over, announcing my lecture and the time when I signed the contract to help them develop their, a special issue of eCAM [Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine], devoted to (unclear) medicine.
Speaker 2: This is the announcement in Chinese, showing my lecture that I would be given- giving at this university which specializes in (unclear) medicine.  It's their own version of traditional Chinese medicine.
Speaker 1: And here's another version, another picture of myself on the campus of this university.  And that announcement there is a running announcement like a marquee at a movie, showing my name and rolling announcement.
Speaker 2: And this is the picture during a ceremony in the office of the president of that university.  He is on the right.  He's serving as the chief editor of this special issue.  This is a kind of introductory ceremony.  This is a souvenir from the university, this plate, which I can serve, use to serve the gifts.  The fellow in the middle was the translator from their--they speak a kind of language which is similar to Arabic and Chinese.
Speaker 1: And this is taken in Korea just prior to my going to China.  The woman on my, well, I'm on the left, and the woman on my right is the editor of a journal which is not really the competitor of my journal [Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine], but it's up and coming.  It, it's a journal devoted to complementary medicine, and she's from England, whose name, I'm sorry, I have forgotten.
Speaker 2: Probably gonna have to be rearranged here because some of them are similar.
Speaker 1: I received an honorary appointment at this university in--in China.  I'm on the left during this ceremony, and then on the right is the president of the university and, of course, they--it's a formal ceremony, and I gave a lecture after that in the full dress, academic dress.
Speaker 2: And this is another colleague that I met for the very first time in Korea at this meeting on alternative medicine.  I'm sorry to say, I've forgotten his name, but he recognized my name at our table, crossed over to the other side of the table and gave me a copy of his book which consists of all of his papers published.  In eCAM, he says forever owes me a note of thanks for helping him publish.
Speaker 1: This is on a flight, on a private plane going to northern California, to the forums of POM Wonderful [POM Wonderful, LLC] where I'm serving as a consultant and a similar picture in that same plane.
Speaker 2: And this is from a paper called The Nation [La Nacion] in Buenos Aires, Argentina.  It's in the middle '90s [1990s].  I think it was 1998.  Does it say there on top in the middle?  March 28, Saturday, March 1998.  It says here the title in Spanish, says invertebrates are a key to understanding ourselves.  And it's about comparative immunology.  And I gave a series of lectures there.
Speaker 1: This is what I looked like when I was twenty-two.  How old was I?  Twenty-two year old when I graduated from Atlanta University with a master's degree in biology.
Speaker 2: This is one of my first books.  It was published by Oxford University Press [Oxford, England].  It's 'Developmental Immunology' [Edwin L. Cooper and Eric Nisbet-Brown] which covers all aspects of the development of the immune system.
Speaker 1: And this, now, shows 'A New Model for Analyzing Anti-Microbial Peptides' ['A New Model for Analyzing Antimicrobial Peptides with Biomedical Applications,' edited by Edwin L. Cooper, Alain Beschin and Martin Bilej].  This focuses on the earthworm, and I published and organized that with a group from France and from the Czech Republic.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  It's really dusty.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) This is a dusty one here (laughter).  You got a- you wanna, here you want a--you got a napkin?
Speaker 2: Here's a napkin (unclear)--
Speaker 1: You got a napkin?  It shows you how often I straighten out my office.  Some of my things gathering (laughter) dust.  Sorry.  You may have to--you'd better keep it over here.  You may have to get--(laughter).
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: It won't go.  It's been on there too long.  This is a book ['Immunology of Annelids,' Martin Bilej, Edwin L. Cooper and P. Roch] that I edited with a group of persons only interested in the immune response in earthworms, and it was done in the Czech Republic and dedicated to one of the authors here.
Speaker 2: This is a special issues of the journal which I was invited to start.  This is called 'Sasong Constitutional Medicine as a Holistic Tailored Medicine' [J.Y. Kim and D.D. Pham].  This is a sub branch of the medicine, alternative medicine in Korea.
Speaker 1: And this is another one which was edited, Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine at a meeting held in Vinci, Italy which is the place where Leonardo [Leonardo da Vinci] was born.  And I wanted on the cover a picture of one of his drawings.  That came from the queen's collection [ph.].  We had to go through all sorts of bureaucracy to get it published, that picture or to borrow it.
Speaker 2: This is of the proceedings from a symposium held in northern China in Qingdao [China], which is on 'Marine Biotechnology.'  It's a thick compendium of all sorts of molecules that are inherited from Marine animals.
