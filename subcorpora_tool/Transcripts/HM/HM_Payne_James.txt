Speaker 1: Now I'm gonna ask about your family history. Gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, but we'll start with your mother.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Jessie Ree Hudson Payne [Jessie Hudson Payne], Jessie, J-E-S-S-I-E, Ree, R-E-E, maiden name was Hudson, H-U-D-S-O-N; last name married name Payne, P-A-Y-N-E.
Speaker 1: And is there a story behind the name behind the name Ree, R-E-E?
Speaker 2: Actually I, I think just back in the day they would name all of their kids with Ree in the middle, Jessie Ree, Verda, Verda Lee [ph.] and it was just always just a middle name that they would use.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So no major step- story there, they were all from Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so that's kind of a convention down there to do?
Speaker 2: It, it is.
Speaker 1: All right okay and what is your mother's da- date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I'm br- date of birth was twelve--is December 11th, 1942 and she was born in Opelousas, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Opelousas okay and how, how do you spell Opelousas?
Speaker 2: Oh that's a good question; I think it's O-P--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah that's right.
Speaker 2: --E-O-L-O-U-I-S [sic.], I think.
Speaker 1: Okay all right, well that's good enough.  So what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family, how far back can you trace the ancestors on that side and what were they doing, what kind of work did they do?
Speaker 2: We can, I can go back to on my mother's side probably three generations, two generations.  The first my, my grandparents [Evelyn Celestine Hudson and Vernon Hudson] were actually alive when I was born, they were disabled at the time.  My mother comes from a very, very large family, it was eleven of them, thirteen born, eleven were able to survive during--when I was present.  Very, very large they spi- they spent most of their time in Louisiana, Opelousas.  And probably right after my mother got married or right before she got married, she and my father [James C. Payne] moved to Texas.  And eventually the entire family kind of transitioned their way to Texas.  Their occupations kind of varied, most of them were just regular laborers.  We had a couple of people that changed tires, worked in- automotive industry.  Not very well educated for the most part formally educated, I don't believe the men, I don't believe any of the men were able to get high school dipl- degrees.  It wa- at that time it was a, a time where when you were old enough you went to work, all the, females all the sisters did get degrees.  Or not degrees, diplomas and then they would go get a certificate, it wasn't really college but they would have some type of certificate, and that was for receptionist or secretarial certificate.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. All right.
Speaker 2: And the history behind it I guess, we go back at some point involved with Native Americans because one of my great aunts was pretty much full blood Cherokee.  So I remember seeing her, that when she walked to the fam- she came to the family reunion which was the Hudson/Celestine family reunion.  What is she here for, and then I found out she was one of my great aunts, and she, she flull- full blood Indian.
Speaker 1: Now is there a tradition of the family being from some place other than Opelousas, Louisiana or, or Louisiana?
Speaker 2: No we all as far as--back that I can go, we all came the, that side of the family were from, all from Opelousas.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As far as I can go back, we haven't really done a ge- genetic testing and see all of the other traces of where we could've come from.  But as far as we can go back on that side of the family it's Louisiana.
Story_ID: 671060
Speaker 1: What was life like for your mother [Jessie Hudson Payne] growing up, did she talk about, you know, her aspirations or what the, what the, what the situation was when she came along?
Speaker 2: Obviously they grew up in a time when most of blacks were working in the fields and so she was never personally responsible for that.  But again she grew up with a large family so when she grew up the siblings raised the younger siblings.  And everyone took care of chores around the house and did stress some education but not formal education.  And so my mom did focus on hard work and her brothers all of them worked really, really hard, and pretty--want to make sure that everyone else was doing the same.  So for her they kind of knew their place where you could and where you couldn't go and they kind of stayed, or tried to stay in the places where you could go.  And tried not to stay in the places where you couldn't go.  I don't believe my family on her side certainly were very involved with the Civil Rights Movement.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: They were familiar with it but I don't think that they were active members of the civil rights and a lot of that you know in Opelousas [Louisiana] there was one caution light.  And so everybody was aware of what was going on but you didn't really participate anything.
Speaker 1: Okay, she came of age I guess just as the Civil Rights Movement was really heating up (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: She would've been twenty in '62 [1962]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And would've been in high school I guess when things are starting to jump off nationally you know Brown versus [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954].  What with the integration of the Cen- Central High School in Arkansas [Little Rock, Arkansas] and some of the other Freedom Rides and all the other things.
Speaker 2: I, I would think she would tell you that most of her issues or concerns revolving ci- involving civil rights occurred actually when she moved to Texas more so than when she was in Louisiana.  Because again in Louisiana as best I get from her conversation, she spent her time understanding where was she supposed to be in, where she was not supposed to be.  When she came to Texas, she came with my father [James C. Payne] and they started trying to do some different things, and given a proximity to Southeast Tex- with Southeast Texas and East Texas particularly lighter Texas.  They experienced a lot more issues that they probably had to del- deal with more so then when she was in Louisiana.
Speaker 1: I guess they, they would've had strength in numbers where she came from because of so many relatives you know.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So many.
Speaker 2: They were called the Hudson Boys (laughter) quite a few of them so she, was just a large, large family.  And with that they didn't really have to go outside of the family to have enjoyment, everyone kind of stayed together.  And until you were eighteen, nineteen you stayed in the house, once you turned eighteen, nineteen you go out to work and then you go off and start a new life.  And you come home during holidays, pretty much we did that and still do it today.  The family will still get together on Thanksgiving, still get together on Christmas until my [maternal] grandmother [Evelyn Celestine Hudson] passed away, and but that was a normal process for us.
Speaker 1: I think you told me your mother finished high school, right?
Speaker 2: She did.
Speaker 1: So was, was that easier for a girl to do in those days?
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: Once you, my understanding in talking with my mom, once you hit of age when you are a guy at thirteen, fourteen you went to work.  So for my mom and her siblings, her sisters they all were able to finish high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And did, did your mother ever talk about her aspirations in terms of what she wanted to be did she, did she have a, a career you know in mind besides being a housewife?
Speaker 2: Clerical.  Back then that was kind of the go to job you can get a clerical degree or a clerical associate degree.  You can go work in some type of business in doing some type of accounting or secretarial work, and she actually received an associate certificate in secretary, which was kind of what we would consider our associate degrees today.
Story_ID: 671061
Speaker 1: Now let me go to your father's side; can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: James Caleb Payne [James C. Payne], James, J-A-M-E-S, Caleb, C-A-L-E-B, Payne, P-A-Y-N-E.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born June 6th, 1940, and he was born in Simmesport, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: And how do you spell that?
Speaker 2: S-I-M-S-P-O-R-T [sic.].
Speaker 1: Okay there are, there are, a meaning for that name (laughter) Simmesport?
Speaker 2: No it's, it's a little, little place (laughter) not too far it, it's a little bit north, right in between--north of Opelousas [Louisiana], south of Shreveport [Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Okay a name like Simmesport you'd (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I know.
Speaker 1: --think that, yeah.
Speaker 2: Sims, S-I-M.
Speaker 1: Sims.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Sims okay.
Speaker 2: Simmesport.
Speaker 1: Simmesport that's different that's different.
Speaker 2: Yeah Simmesport.
Speaker 1: Okay all right.  So once again like what do you know about the ancestors on your father's side?
Speaker 2: With my father limited, he also, he came from a small family but his family, his mother [Alma Scott Russell] and, his mother and father [Rufus Payne] did not stay married.  And they created families outside of each other, I never knew my grandmother, she passed within one month of my birth, so never had a chance to meet her.  I, I personally don't remember her, I do remember my grandfather and education was not as strong in my, on my father, father's side.  He had one younger brother that served time in the se- se- well went to [U.S. military] service, and then my, his, he had an older, a younger sister as well.  But education again wasn't highly stressed in their family, but similar to my mom [Jessie Hudson Payne], the sister was able to get her degree.  And then my, my dad did not, but his younger brother did.  My dad was the oldest and similar once you hit thirteen, fourteen you go to work, you bring home money, you take care of your siblings.  By the time my dad moved to Texas, his brother and sister were actually here in, in Southeast Texas as well.  And they were actually able to get their degrees, so when I say degrees, their high school diplomas.  So that's as far as either, either of his siblings went and my dad never finished high school.
Story_ID: 671062
Speaker 1: What kind of work did your father [James C. Payne] do?
Speaker 2: He was a mechanic, and he was actually one of the first mechanics that was hired by Firestone [Firestone Tire and Rubber Company] that was of color.  And did pretty well with Firestone and was going to be one of the certified mechanics, he was always what they call a shade tree mechanic around the neighborhood.  And then ultimately got a job working for Firestone, when he first came here he was assisting my [paternal] grandfather [Rufus Payne] with dump trucks.  My grandfather was actually a dump truck driver and owned the first black dump truck business in Southeast Texas.  And because if you know anything about dump trucks, they breakdown a lot, my dad learned to fix dump trucks, because he was always fixing my grandfather's dump truck.
Speaker 1: Okay so is that be- because of the mechanism that dumps the material?
Speaker 2: Yes, the mechanisms they just creates a lot of dust inside of the channels and, and, and pistons and creates all kinds of problems.  And so my dad was--just became very mechanically inclined I guess, of how to fix cars.  And you know one of the things he was very good at was fixing cars.  And so I, we never took car to a place to get it fixed; I learned when I was probably twelve, thirteen how to do everything to a car.  We would change oil and filters, pars- spark plugs, tune ups, brake shoes, brake pads that was we, we never would take the car to (laughter) a car dea- to a car shop.  We would always do it ourselves.
Story_ID: 671063
Speaker 1: Now is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: It varies.  My dad [James C. Payne] would tell you, he's no longer alive, but my dad would tell you one way and my mom [Jessie Hudson Payne] would tell you something else.  But, best I get, the answer is they met through some acquaintance, friends and just start going out on dates.  And one thing led to another and started dating, it's interesting that after my mom and dad got married, his younger brother married my mom's younger sister.  So we had, had some double cousins at one period of time so.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did they attend the same church by any chance or?
Speaker 2: No my mother was very involved in church, my dad was not until probably, until we were going and then he got more active in church and, and involvement in church.
Story_ID: 671064
Speaker 1: When you think about your parents' personalities, their dispositions their sense of humor, how they walk, how they talk, what they look like.  Who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: My dad [James C. Payne], certainly physically, a physical appearance I take my physical appearance and my dad's are very, very close.  As far as our personality though, probably more my mom [Jessie Hudson Payne] just because she's, she's very aggressive about making sure her point comes across.  And my dad was very kind of, he just took everything with a grain of salt, he just didn't care.  He just enjoyed life very, very talkative, always wanted to be the center of the conversation.  And that's really not me that's, actually it's my son, but it's not really me my, my younger brother [Jason Payne] probably took more after my dad in personality.  And I took on my dad's physical features.
Story_ID: 671065
Speaker 1: Can you name your siblings and put yourself in order?
Speaker 2: Yes I have an older sister Valerie Stephanie Payne [Valerie Payne Gradney] and her mar- her married name is Gradney, and she's old- she's four years older than me.  Then I'm in, the middle child, and then I have a younger brother Jason Edwin Payne [Jason Payne] and he is about nine and half years younger than me.
Speaker 1: Okay so this is it's only three of you and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: Three siblings in the family where your mother [Jessie Hudson Payne] had eleven, right?
Speaker 2: Yes (laughter).
Speaker 1: How many were in your father's [James C. Payne] fam- family?
Speaker 2: He, it was just, he had a younger sister and younger brother and that was really the three, and then of course I think I told you his father [Rufus Payne] had eventually went to another family.  And, and he had two more children, two more daughters--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so technically I guess it was three, he had three sisters and one brother.
Story_ID: 671066
Speaker 1: So you were born in 1968 in Port Arthur [Texas].
Speaker 2: Port Arthur.
Speaker 1: Were your parents living there then, or?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We were living in Port Arthur on 1919 Stillwell [Boulevard].
Speaker 1: Okay all right and they had moved, they were other, other relatives in Port Ar- Arthur or did they?
Speaker 2: We had my mother's older brother was already living in Port Arthur and I think she was living with him.  And then my dad [James C. Payne] moved to Port Arthur and then once they got married they moved into 1919 Stillwell, and of course when they got married, her younger sister Evelyn [ph.] moved from Louisiana to move in with them.  So when, as when I recall my living in 1919 Stillwell it was my mom [Jessie Hudson Payne] and dad, my sister [Valerie Payne Gradney], my Aunt Evelyn and, and, and myself.
Speaker 1: Okay now the, the Beaumont [Texas] area I mean--is Port Arthur right is, is a part of, of a it's almost like, for what I understand it's almost like a tidewater area with a lot smaller places they add up to a bigger whole.
Speaker 2: Right, Port Arthur and Beaumont actually is, it's very close and people kind of go back and forth today without any issue.  When I was growing up it was really two separate cities you know traveling to Beaumont was almost like a, a journey.  Not very many people would go back and forth.  Port Arthur is a community, very petrochemical community, a lot of oil refineries.  Back when I was growing up I would say 60, 70 percent of the people had something to do with the oil and gas industry when I was growing up.  Matter of fact that was kind of the go to job when you were in high school you, you want to get good grade so that you can go work at the refinery.  You know they were union they, they, they had good jobs, good benefits.  And I, I can tell you that the, the community was thriving obviously with automation, things of that nature downsizing the community has certainly changed.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so but this region is the, sits on one of the largest oil finds in the history of the--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --world, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Spindletop [Beaumont, Texas].
Speaker 2: Spindletop it was the boom, actually Spindletop there's still a museum [Spindletop Gladys City Boomtown Museum, Beaumont, Texas] out now near Lamar [Lamar University, Beaumont, Texas] really focusing on the explosion of the oil industry.  And to this day I mean oil and gas is still a major part of Southeast Texas, it's just not as dominating as it was when I was growing up.  When I--literally when I was growing up everyone, you knew someone that worked in the refineries that was just not a doubt, you knew someone that worked in the refineries.
Speaker 1: Okay, does Spindletop still produce oil?
Speaker 2: Well not technically Spindletop but there is still, there, there's still de- derricks around here now that are still producing oil.  And--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And you can still drive around and see the refineries now.
Story_ID: 671067
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: My earliest childhood memory really is me sitting on a swing at 1919 Stillwell [Boulevard] playing with my father [James C. Payne] and we were racing down the boulevard.  That's really my earliest childhood memory.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay and now what were you like as a little kid growing up, I mean?
Speaker 2: I was actually pretty studious I enjoyed sports--nothing like what we have today, AAU [Amateur Athletic Union] and basketball leagues and all that kind of stuff.  We didn't have that growing up in Port Arthur [Texas].  Our summer basketball, recreational basketball was going to someone's house and shooting basketball.  Basketball and racing, running was kind of our big hobbies, we had to do things that really didn't require a lot of economic, economics because we just didn't have it.  Our family, I wouldn't say we were poor, I mean we were able to take care of all the things that we needed, but we did not have the opportunity to go on vacations and all stuff like that.  And no one in my neighborhood was that way either, so if one person had a basketball, everybody in the neighborhood had a basketball.  The goal that was in our yard was shared by the whole neighborhood and it was kind of one of those situations, I didn't have to be outside with them for them to be shooting basketball.  So if the neighb- if, if somebody had a goal, it was everybody's goal, it, there was a, a lot, empty lot that, that lot belonged to everybody in the neighborhood.  So we could go play football or race on the lot and I didn't have to get permission from the owner of the lot that was everybody's lot.  And that was the community which I grew up in.  As far as me, we--my mom [Jessie Hudson Payne] again stressed school, my dad really did not stress it, because my mom took care of that.  He stressed more having common sense that was kind of his thing, he wanted to make sure I knew how to plumb a house and change light fixtures and fix cars.  He wanted to make sure I had the ability to do things with my hands, and my mom really kind of focused on making assure we can d- making sure we could do things with our mind.  So once I got through doing my chores at home, and when I say chores with my mom, that's cleaning and straightening up whatever and then doing the chores with my dad, which would include whatever he thought he could be repaired at the house, then I can go and do what I want to do outside, which was play or run around or shoot basketball.  I keep saying shoot basketball 'cause that was kind of our big thing.
Speaker 1: Okay it's interesting that, you know, in Texas that would be bigger than say baseball.
Speaker 2: Well baseball, reason why it wasn't big because most of us didn't have gloves, so (laughter) we you had one bat, you had one glove.  And so when we would play baseball we would play what we call straight base you, you can go around our, our first, second and third base then come home, you just.  You hit the ball you go straight to base and you come back and whoever was on the base would have the glove.  Because there, that's the only glove we had in the neighborhood so you hit the ball, you pick it up, you throw it to first base and the first baseman could always have the glove.  And that's, that was all, that's why baseball really never took off with us in Southeast Texas, in our community.  Now you could go on the other side of town, it was different.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But in my community that's, that, that wasn't very strong.
Story_ID: 671068
Speaker 1: Was there a name for your community in--now this is still in Port Arthur [Texas], right?
Speaker 2: Still Port Arthur there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --there's what they call west side and east side obviously, west side Port Arthur was predominantly black. East side was a mixture and then there was really east.  Which was predominantly white so I was in the east side the, the kind of in between east.  Obviously I went to school on the west side of town which was all black and then as, as things have transitioned now you're starting to see you know as they call white flight.  And now blacks have taken up probably the population--Jefferson [Jefferson County, Texas] and Port Arthur now is probably 55 almost 60 percent black.  And it's, and then of course you have a large Hispanic population and a, and Vietnamese population now in Port Arthur.
Speaker 1: Okay so when you're growing up it's just black, basically black and white?
Speaker 2: When I grew up it was black and white, Vietnamese just started coming in, I didn't have any whites in any of my classes until I got to college [University of Houston, Houston, Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay, now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I grew up all-black elementary [Franklin Elementary School, Port Arthur, Texas], junior high [Woodrow Wilson Junior High School; Woodrow Wilson Early College High School, Port Arthur, Texas] and high school [Abraham Lincoln High School; Memorial High School, Port Arthur, Texas].
Story_ID: 671069
Speaker 1: What was the name of your grade school?
Speaker 2: Franklin Elementary [Franklin Elementary School, Port Arthur, Texas]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and then I went to Woodrow Wilson High- Junior High [Woodrow Wilson Junior High School; Woodrow Wilson Early College High School, Port Arthur Texas], and then I finished from Abraham Lincoln High School [Memorial High School, Port Arthur, Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so, so in did, did you have a favorite subject in school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Math I, I absolutely loved math, absolutely hated English and its interesting now that I get paid a lot of money to do English.  But it, I absolutely hated English, math was, it just came easy to me.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay favorite teachers in grade school?
Speaker 2: In grade school had a lot probably my most influential was my coach, Coach Gamble [James Gamble] he was just very, very strong and, and disciplined both from athletics as well as academics.  We had a lot of teachers that really focused on being the very best that you could be and most of my teachers were black.  So they understood the importance of education and really pressed us really hard to be the very best.  And so when I said I had a lot of great teachers, I, I am more if, if I were to say you know someone would say, "Hey where did you go to school?"  Before I say University of Houston [Houston, Texas] or any other college or institution I always talk about Lincoln because that's where I think I really got what I needed to make me different.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Coach Gamble was a coach basketball coach at Lincoln, right?
Speaker 2: He was hall of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --famer basketball coach [Texas High School Basketball Hall of Fame], well respected and he just taught us everything about basketball and life.
Story_ID: 671070
Speaker 1: All right so when you were ten years old there was an incident where you were injured by a television, now tell us what happened.
Speaker 2: I was--it was actually July 5th, 1978, I was standing by a television, a Magnavox TV and it exploded.  I remember it was approximately at 3:30 in the afternoon, we wanted to watch some TV.  I, we plugged the TV up, turned it on and it was a frost, the screen was just a frost, nothing was showing.  So we turned the TV off and was just talking, me and my little cousin was just talking, and all of a sudden the TV just exploded.
Speaker 1: It was turned off?
Speaker 2: It was turned off.
Speaker 1: And?
Speaker 2: It was still it, it was still plugged up, but it was turned off and we turned it off because there was no picture tube, there was nothing showing.  And, and we were probably six or eight feet from the TV and all of sudden you just hear this huge boom and explosion, I was at my aunt's house.  And the TV picture, the picture tube and the glass from the picture tube just shot out.  And parts of the glass went through my hand and through my knee and both--I didn't realize it at the time.  But actually went completely through and cost me to lose one of my, my fourth knuckle and half of my third knuckle.  And I didn't even realize at the time that it had gone through my knee, but it just basically looked like a shotgun had been shot through my, my hand and my knee.
Speaker 1: Gee whiz.
Story_ID: 671071
Speaker 1: We know that black communities all over the country were not getting into litigation--
Speaker 2: No (laughter).
Speaker 1: --very much in those days and so we, now they were offering, I've heard stories about awful things that happen to people and, and there's no, they get no compensation.  'Cause they really don't even know how go about it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: So what happened in your case?
Speaker 2: Well in my case, first of all ey- we had to get me to the hospital immediately and you know technology, medical technology at that time was not where it is today.  So when they put my hand in a blue solution, the doctor came in and immediately said they were gonna have to amputate my hand.  And you know I wasn't the most, I mean Webster [Webster's Dictionary] literate person, but I understood what amputation meant (laughter).  And so I really started freaking out when they start saying they were gonna have to amputate my hand.  And then the doctor said, "Well let's just wrap it," and they were gonna try to do the best they could do, and then they were just gonna wait and see.  So I woke up the next morning and I looked and I realized my hand was completely wrapped.  And they had actually gone in and performed surgery, both in the front and back, my knee was actually okay.  Because apparently it was just a flesh wound, but my middle finger was completely crushed, my third finger was broke, and then the other tendons were in the, other fingers were damaged.  And so they weren't sure at that time what was going to happen to my hand and at that moment, you know, not a lot of lawyers around.  Certainly no lawyers of color at that time, but my uncle L.C. Hudson [Linton C. Hudson] had always had friends, he always had friends.  And he found this baby lawyer, Tom Peterson [Thomas A. Peterson], he was a baby lawyer at the time, he's now senior lawyer.  But Tom Peterson had just come to, had just come to Southeast Texas and he introduced my fam- my mom [Jessie Hudson Payne] and dad [James C. Payne] to Tom Peterson.  And Tom Peterson came over and asked me kind of what happened; everyone thought, because when they saw the, the, the photos of the TV that I must've thrown something at the TV, which is what caused the TV to explode.  And I was like, "No- we didn't throw anything into the TV, I was just standing there."  And of course you have to get that, do you believe a ten year old kid?  Tom Peterson believed me, he's like, "He was just standing there," and now that I know more about products liability he secured the television, took photos.  And then they found a cracked picture tube in the Magnavox TV, and as a result we sued mau- the Magnavox television for the injuries that I sustained.  My mom and dad really weren't familiar with litigation, had no clue about litigation.  And so my mom would ask me, you know "What do you wanna do," you know, I'm ten, well at this time I'm probably eleven or twelve, but she had no clue, I had no clue.  But I did have to go through the process of litigation, I had to give the deposition, I remember giving the deposition.  And it kind of intrigued me because they were all, you know, roomful of lawyers, you know, again white lawyers and I really wasn't as comfortable being around a bunch of people with suits and ties on.  And here's, here I am sitting in a room.
Speaker 1: So wha- was your lawyer a black or white?
Speaker 2: He was white.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Young baby lawyer at the time (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tom Peterson was.
Speaker 2: He was a baby lawyer at the time.  With, there weren't, there weren't any black lawyers in Southeast Texas (laughter) at that time.  Donald Floyd was probably, who's now a judge, was probably the first black lawyer that I even knew existed in Southeast Texas.  And he, he, he wasn't he, he was not a lawyer at the time.  But we, we sat in a room and I gave a deposition told them exactly what happened and then they made an offer to me to settle the case.  And the first offer they made, they communicated the offer to my parents, my parents said okay.
Story_ID: 671072
Speaker 1: Now, now there's a, a scene that's described in this outline, I don't know where it came from, in another interview with you where you said that you were in a room with all these lawyers.  And they asked you do you have any pictures of what happened.
Speaker 2: Right, well the lawyers--and again I know better now, I mean I know (laughter) now because I'm a lawyer--but at the time apparently my lawyer had not given, given them the photos from the accident.  And I had some photos of my hand and knee immediately after the accident.  Well the lawyers who represented Magnavox apparently had not received those photos.  And so they asked me in deposition they said, "Well, tell me a little bit about your hand and tell me a little bit about?"  And I start describing to them you know exactly where the TV was and there's nothing there and, and that I had the marks here.  And the marks on the back and, and the guy asked me, "Well did you take any photos of your hand?" I said, "No, but he did."  And, and there were, and they started like, "Who, who are you pointing to?" I said, "Here, him," and it was my lawyer.  And they said, "Well, when did he take these, those photos?" I said, "Right after I got out of the hospital."  You know again, I didn't know they hadn't been produced, they were just asking me what I knew; I was told to tell the truth.  And so I didn't realize my, my lawyer was trying to hold those photos back for that great moment when he could just produce them.  And of course at that moment they wanna take a break and I'm trying to figure out, did I do something wrong?  And I could tell something was different because everybody was, "I need to see this, I need to see this."  And I just sat there like, I get back and they said, "Are these the photos you were talking about?" I said, "Yeah, that's, that's the photos he took of me at my house."  And it was a lot of shoo, shoo going back and forth and shortly thereafter we, we got the case resolved.  It's interesting; I have those photos.
Speaker 1: Right, and showed me one when we came in.
Speaker 2: I have, I have all the photos, I have all of those photos that he took, I still have them today.  Tom and, and you know again I was twelve, twelve when I probably gave the deposition.  He, he did some things for me that that I think a lot of lawyers would not have done, he followed me.  You know we settled the case for I'm sure they thought great value of- at the time, obviously now knowing, looking at it from my perspective as a lawyer I would question that.  But because I was a minor I couldn't receive the funds, so it had to be invested, had to be put into the register at the court 'til I turn eighteen.   And so although we had settled the case, I didn't have any of the money and it wasn't a lot, but it, it was, it was money.
Speaker 1: How much was, was it can I ask?
Speaker 2: It was seventy-seven hundred dollars, which was what I received; it was put into the register of the court.  And Tom, because I couldn't get it until I was eighteen kept in contact with me, and he did a very good job of making sure I understood the process.  And then he followed me until the time I turned eighteen and I was able to get my money, once I got my money, I was able to get me a car and pay for graduation and some things of that nature.  Then when I went to University of Houston [Houston, Texas], he continued to follow me, talk to me and said, "Hey any time you're in town come by and see me.  I'd like to talk to you and visit with you," and I would do that, so when I would come back in town, I would come and visit with him.  And he'd talk with me and it really kind of got me interested in the practice of law.  And when I went to law school [University of Houston Law Center, Houston, Texas], I called him, let him know I was going to law school and, and we pretty much kept into contact all the way through law school.  And when I got out of law school I went to work in Houston [Texas] and then at some point I decided to, after two years I decide to come back to Jefferson County [Texas].  And of course when I came back to Jefferson County, the first person I called was Tom Peterson [Thomas A. Peterson], talk to him.  And it's interesting now he, he was a little bit more senior at that time.  But he and I have had cases and referred cases back and forth and he's still practicing today down the street.
Story_ID: 671073
Speaker 1: So did you resolve--I mean, I mean so, so that the, the accident and the resulting litigation influenced your decision to become a lawyer then?
Speaker 2: No doubt.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  That was the defining moment for me, it was, you know, everyone says I wanna be a lawyer, I wanna be a doctor when you're growing up; I wanna be a basketball player.  But that was an experience where I just saw, hm, I can do this. The deposition everybody said, "Were you nervous," you know doctors, lawyers are trying to tell me don't be nervous.  I wasn't nervous; I was just telling them what happened, and really the mentoring I think from Tom Peterson [Thomas A. Peterson] kept me involved in the bracts of law.  I saw hands on how that mentoring has such, would have such a great influence on my life.  Because it, had he been just a lawyer and said hey here's your money and walked away, I'm not sure I would've continued in the legal career.  But he kept making sure, "How are your grades, what are you doing, where you going to school?  Where have you applied," and then I'd come home and I would go and visit with him and here I am walking into the lawyer's office and he knows who I am.  And, and, and the secretary knows who I am, and I, I didn't have to set an appointment because if, if I just showed up, he would, oh come on in.  He would show me the pictures of when I was twelve and ten and, and stuff like that, 'cause I was kind of one of his big cases when he was a baby lawyer.  I mean this his first probably, probably his first big case.  And so I think he had a special relationship with me and I had one with him and that mentoring gr- had a great, great impact on my life.
Speaker 1: Okay so it made, made the whole thing, the whole aspirations of becoming a lawyer more accessible to you (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And exposed me I, I think exposure was probably the greatest impact, because it exposed me to something that but for this accident I'm not sure I would've received.  I, I would've been just like everyone else, look I've got good grades, let's go to refinery, make good money.
Story_ID: 671074
Speaker 1: Another thing that kind of defined what you were doing in, in those days was basketball, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You became an outstanding basketball player.
Speaker 2: Basketball in Southeast Texas and football, well sports period in Southeast Texas.  We have always historically been known for having exceptional athletes in basketball, football, track you name it, it happens in Southeast Texas.  And so everyone thought basketball was kind of the dynasty for Southeast Texas, particular in my high school.  People would set their vacations around the state championship week because it was just presumed that when state finals would come around we were gonna be there.
Speaker 1: Lincoln [Abraham Lincoln High School; Memorial High School, Port Arthur, Texas] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Lincoln was gonna be there.  And so I came up and I played on the 1986 state championship team.
Speaker 1: Now in those days, now during the days of really hard segregation, black schools only played each other.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So were you now, this is '78 [sic.] though, but it's still down, down in East Tex- Texas so, so who did you play, did you play the other?
Speaker 2: We played, we played, we played white schools too (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: It was (laughter) it was different but we played white schools.  Because you didn't, you didn't get any calls when you, you played certain schools, and we knew that.  You just, you, so you had to beat them and beat them really good.
Speaker 1: So, so that--
Speaker 2: So that you--
Speaker 1: They used the seven man press, huh?
Speaker 2: Oh my god you, you, you did not go to certain schools expecting to get calls and we knew that.  We, and our coach, Coach Gamble [James Gamble] really always told us, "Beat them so bad that by the time the referees try to take it, they couldn't."  And so we would beat teams by thirty, forty points, and we felt like until we were up thirty, forty points, we weren't safe.  Because you know if it was close you're gonna lose, so we just didn't let it get close, and that's pretty much the way we played.
Speaker 1: Yeah that's, I guess it seems like a, a metaphor for the rest of life as a black person in that, this area I guess or in the U.S.
Speaker 2: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You guess you gotta really be up or you're not, you're not going far enough.
Speaker 2: You, you don't, you stand a chance if, if you're even, you lose.  And I tell you that had such a, an impact in my life.  Because when we would be up by ten you know a lot of coaches today 'cause things have changed, will go to a stall, and try to just run the clock out.
Speaker 1: Like the, Dean Smith.
Speaker 2: The Dean, yeah, yeah four corner stall.  When we were up by ten, we were pressing hard because we felt like we were still down.  And we were, we were just aggressive trying to make sure that we that we were up by twenty or thirty or forty.  I think we bust the clock because back then clocks didn't go to a hundred, we don't want, we want to flip the clock so that it would go back to two or zero.  We couldn't make it close and so we always pushed to actually outdo and outperform beyond the norm.  And that really carried over on the academic side for me, and really within my profession.  At no point did I feel like I could do whatever everybody else was doing, I had to be better, and I couldn't be close, I had to be much better.  And if, if I was just close, I was gonna lose, so I couldn't, if they studied one hour, I couldn't study one hour.  And, and, and we go in and do the same thing.  If they studied one hour, I had to study three, so I've gotta know three times as much as they know.  Because if I'm gonna get in there and compete, I gotta be much better than them, and that was the way we carried everything.  So when we would go to the state finals game, you know everyone talks about state finals game and how competitive it is and all the other stuff.  Our state finals games weren't competitive at all, we, we blew everybody out, just because we just never stopped, we just hammered, hammered, hammered.
Story_ID: 671075
Speaker 1: So, so you pressed on defense and now what, what style offense did you run then?
Speaker 2: We focused nothing but defense, offense we ran a one set offensive play and we did whatever they gave us.  So if they came up on us, we blew by them, if they ga- stayed off of us, we shot outside, but just sa- had one set offensive scheme.  We didn't have you know four different offensive plays, matter of fact when we were on offense, I was a point guard.  The coach [James Gamble] would give us one, two, three, four signal and people thought we were calling offensive plays.  That was really a defensive press, so it really it, you know people thought it was an offensive play, but it really wasn't.  I would come down and he would give me the one, the two the three signal and then I would make sure everyone knew.  One, two or three that's to tell them after we score, get in press one, get in press two, we're gonna run pr- three.  So everything was focused on defense, because we knew that if we could just keep the tempo up, we would score.  And so that was pretty much I met--we would just press, our coach had this saying, we were gonna press off the bus.  So when (laughter) when the game started, you just knew you were gonna get a lot of pressure.
Speaker 1: So this is a, for those well those who, well those who know basketball know you have to be in incredible shape to press like that.
Speaker 2: Oh (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The whole game.
Speaker 2: --yes and you know it was, it was you know I, I te- I joke with my son--they have to go the, to tour days all the other stuff to get ready for basketball.  I said we never ran bleachers before basketball season; we never had to run the mile, because we were in great shape.  Because we make sure we were in shape throughout the entire summer.  They actually thought that they could separate our first team, our first string and our second string and we would've come in first in first and second in the district.  Because we were so aggressive, because that style that we played in the game, we played each other in practice.  There was no I made the basketball team as a freshman and I was gonna be on the basketball team as a senior, you had to tryout every year.  And every game, there were no such things, "Oh, well I'm a, I'm the starter," you might be starting this week, but if you didn't perform in practices last week, you may not start next week.  So practice was way more competitive than the games, I mean we, we went at it in practice, because you wanted to get playing time.  And so by the time we got we, you know, when we came to the game we were just, the game was fun (laughter).  It was you know we was just beating up on people at game time.
Speaker 1: Did you have ve- very many tall players on the team [at Abraham Lincoln High School; Memorial High School, Port Arthur, Texas]?
Speaker 2: We did for, at that time, we had one guy 6'7", Anthony Allen wound up going to Georgetown [Georgetown University, Washington, D.C.], and another guy Ronnie Halliburton who was 6'5" went to LSU [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  But nothing like we hear, see, we hear today, the 6'10", 6'11"s, we were very athletic and our team was very smart, we were a very smart IQ basketball, IQ team, we just understood our roles.  If I scored twenty points great, but most likely than not I might score five, I'm still happy because we won.  No one really averaged more than eight points a game because we were always running people in and out.
Story_ID: 671076
Speaker 1: So you made mo- most your baskets on, on the steals and the breaks and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: And dunks, and all of us was pretty athletic, all of us could jump including myself, even though I was short (laughter).  Because I grew up in a time during Phi Slama Jama [Houston Cougars], that was popular when we were in high school, and Spud Webb was, was kind of on the hori- on the rise, and he and I were almost about the same height.  And so I, you know had to learn the dunk because that was kind of the thing to do when we were growing (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So could you dunk at 5'8", 5'9"?
Speaker 2: Oh yes when I was I, I can jump and so it was, it was a wow factor, and again it was, really it was a, a way to intimidate people.  Because everyone would expect our 6'7" guy to be able to dunk, of course he can dunk, but they wouldn't expect to see the 5'7", 5'8" guy dunk.  And so when you start doing that you know people the, the, the op- your opposition was like wow, and you know you, we would do things to really kind of intimidate them.  Because we wanted to make sure that we took the referees completely out of the game.
Speaker 1: Yeah that's important it's so many close games that I've heard so many stories about close games being lost in the state level by black teams that didn't play like you all.
Speaker 2: Well and, and the problem we had, because we played very aggressive, particularly me, we had a lot of problems locally with the fans.  I remember in the ninth grade we had an altercation with a school north of here, they had a very good athlete, a guy named Don [ph.].  And the ball went between my legs and he flipped me over, I flipped him back over.  And we were just going after the ball and all of a sudden you know the sta- the fans were just going crazy, making all the kind of racial remarks and, and, and just making the game very, very uncomfortable.  It was interesting 'cause it wasn't the players, you know Don and I we had been playing ball against each other for years.  But they were, the fans were so aggressive and throwing stuff and, and throwing popcorn and all of the stuff at us.  That at one point, you know, I mean it just turned into an all out brawl.  And it wasn't the players it was us and the fans and the coaches, they had to take us to the locker room and escort us out through the snake line with the police arm and arm as we were getting on our buses.  And they're rocking our buses and it was, it was it you know for a ninth grader wasn't a whole lot of fun (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay so you--the Lincoln Bumblebees [Abraham Lincoln High School; Memorial High School, Port Arthur, Texas] you know which sounds appropriate for that style of play (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's what we did.
Speaker 1: You know won the state championship in '86 [1986] your senior year, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And so that was a big, big deal, so you're an All-State point guard for the--?
Speaker 2: We were yes, we, we won probably five, four or five state championships in the '80s [1980s], so we, everyone expected us to be in, in, in Austin [Texas].  Our year, we still go by the fact that now the big fight is who had, who had the best state championship team of all the teams.  My younger brother [Jason Payne] played on '95 [1995] state championship team so there's always this, who had the base, best state championship team.  We of course say we, we did because we had the best record so we, we, we no team in the State of Texas ever beat us the entire time we played.  We lost one game in Louisiana but other than that, we were undefeated.
Speaker 1: Really? That's quite a record.
Story_ID: 671077
Speaker 1: But you were also part of the Student Congress, you were, served on the school's Good Sportsman League [ph.], Board of Governors, the National Honor Society, Key Club [Key Club International].  This is you know, so you were a leader in high school.
Speaker 2: Our, there were two point guards, myself and Jeff Lewis [Jeffrey Lewis], we finished number two and three in our class rakings academics.  And we were both state championship teams, they had things that come, that had come out recently the House Bill 72 which was designed that if you made an F you couldn't play basketball, or, for six weeks.  That never affected our team, we had, I, I when I say we had a smart team, we had a smart IQ team because they had basketball IQ.  But they were good in academics, not every one of them, but for the most part probably ten of the twelve seniors, very good grades.  And academically we were performing as well in the academic side as we were performing on the courtroom- I mean on the court, on the court.  Actually Jeff and I competed in the academic, academic decathlon team which was you know ten subjects math, science and, and various subjects.  Where they, we go and compete against other schools academically, we were on the academic decathlon team.  We competed and we competed in the same way we would compete on the basketball court, you know, so we weren't just gonna go and, and solve the problem or, or study.  We had to beat them and in our, in our mindset we had to beat them good (laughter).  So that there would be no question about whether or not it was close.
Story_ID: 671078
Speaker 1: Other than your coach [James Gamble] did you have any favorite teachers in high school [Abraham Lincoln High School; Memorial High School, Port Arthur, Texas] or, or--?
Speaker 2: You know obviously my English teacher, even though I did not like English, she really pushed us for excellence, Miss Moss, Roberta Moss.  She was very strong in making sure that we spoke the language of proper English.  Obviously you can't go on the park, which is where we learned to play basketball, and say, "Excuse me sir, I would like to play in the next game if you would allow me to participate on your team."  You would never play where I grew up (laughter) if you went in and add, ask somebody to play on a team.  But so we had to speak the, the park language, the park dialect.  But when you went into the classroom, you couldn't take that park language and bring it into the classroom.  And so she wouldn't allow it so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You had to be bilingual then?
Speaker 2: You that, absolutely, you go in the park it, it was one of the, you know, "Hey, I'm running with you next, I've got next with you.  We're all right," and I'm like, "Yeah, you can run with me." "Okay," you can't say that (laughter) in the classroom.  And I can't go in the courtroom now and say, "Hey judge, I'm next right okay, good," I'm--you just couldn't do that.  And Miss, Miss Moss made it clear to us it's okay to have your park jargon, but you need to understand English, proper English.
Speaker 1: And this is something it, it probably happens in other places but I've taken this as a, as a Texas phenomena is, is the language in terms of you know the black schools I--I don't like trying to explain it.  But Barbara Jordan, okay, an example of someone who, someone of, one of the Texas politicians who I won't name said that she didn't really talk like that.  And said not really, I mean she affected that, (imitates Barbara Jordan) "I am here to talk about the [U.S.] Constitution," I mean it was an affectation.  I mean she could do it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --you know to the letter but she wasn't, that really her, and other people have, the figure that was in 'The Great Debaters,' Tolson [Melvin B. Tolson], you know the professor, another friend of mine, had them in college in at Texas Southern [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas] and talked how he would affect this you know speech pattern.  And, and you know seem like it was something was really big in Texas to try to speak above (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --one's birth condition, you know.
Speaker 2: Henry Mays [ph.] was our drama teacher and we would always have to do plays that were nontraditional, you would think nontraditional black school plays.  You know 'Othello' when you're dealing with Shakespeare [William Shakespeare], he would want you to learn their jargon.  And, and I remember his first poem that he made everyone learn was, "East is east and west is west and never the twain shall meet" ['The Ballad of East and West,' Rudyard Kipling].  Simple but he wanted you to speak it with such authority, he would turn on the big bright light on stage and you would have to project your voice to the very back of the auditorium.  He wanted to make sure you were speaking from your diaphragm and, and meant it.  (Pronunciation) "East is east," and he, you know he, he wanted you to almost have a feeling where that, that when you said it the, the room would quiver.  And he taught us that and, and, and you say well that I mean now you're fa- now you faking.  He taught us to be able to speak a different language and, and to sound like Othello to, to, to perform with a, an accent.  And if we had to do a southern deal where you know, (pronunciation) "She was just out in the cornfields," we had to, we have to change our dialect.  But he taught us to change dialects and, and, and to do it strong.  And so when I started doing debate and, and, and, and we were doing the various pros through academic decathlon, when they would give us a subject to talk on contemporary speaking, I would get up and, and I could, I could kind of change to whatever, what I felt the subject was.  I could, I could just change, and I do it now, you know I, I can't go to north--to New York [New York] and start talking about, "Well judge we," you know, "we're getting ready to start (pronunciation) voir dire," because in New York you don't say voir dire, New York you say voir dire.  And so when I go to New York I, I gotta sound New York-ish because I can't stand in front of a jury sounding like I'm from the south, as they would say.  And so I you know, I, I have, I change and you, you have to ch- you have to you know I go to North Carolina and to be honest when I'm in North Carolina I have a little extra drawl, to--when (laughter) I speak.  Because if they hear a language that they're not comfortable with, then I'm not communicating in a way that's effective.
Story_ID: 671079
Speaker 1: When you were on the verge of graduating from high school [Abraham Lincoln High School; Memorial High School, Port Arthur, Texas] did you see yourself, you, you--were you on the track to become a lawyer?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  People ask me all the time, "Did you know you were gonna become a lawyer?" Absolutely.  I, I started doing the things that I thought needed to prepare me for that area, one of which was English.  I started, even though I still hated English, I knew I had to learn English.  And so I had become a good writer, I took debate, I practiced my communication skills and, and things of that nature.  I, I just knew what I needed to do prepare for it.  I spent some time with Tom Peterson [Thomas A. Peterson] and asked him, "Hey, if you, if, if you had to start all over again what would you focus on if you want to become a lawyer?"  He told me--I, I studied political science because at that time everyone who went to law school went to political science.  I don't know why, but that was kind of the norm, you go, you know go to political science, do pre-law and then go to law school.  So I took political science and that's where, that's kind of the path I took, when I went to University of Houston [Houston, Texas].
Story_ID: 671080
Speaker 1: University of Houston [Houston, Texas] in terms of basket- now--now did you plan to play basketball at the University of Houston?
Speaker 2: I did, I actually received an academic scholarship to go to the University of Houston, and not, not a basketball scholarship.  But I met with Guy Lewis at the time who was the coach of the Phi Slama Jama and he told me that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The nickname of the team which is, tho- those who are not--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: The nickname of the Houston Cou- Cougars basketball team the, the in a certain per- period of time because they had so many slam dunkers on the team was Phi Slama--
Speaker 2: Phi Slama Jama that was the name, the nickname for the Un- University of Houston Cougars basketball team.  Well, I kind of fit in a little bit, because I could dunk you know so I, I could be the Phi Slama Jama.  And the year I went to the University of Houston they told me since I, I was on academic scholarship, I could try to walk on.  And because they didn't have to give up a scholarship for me, so I, I played summer ball with the guys, Cadillac Anderson, Hobbs [ph.], Rickie Winslow, Stacey Belcher, a bunch of us.  We played summer ball together and when I get to Uni- University of Houston, Guy Lewis leaves, they bring in a new coach.  And let's just say that the new coach and I didn't really see eye to eye.  His style of play and my style of play weren't necessarily connected with one another, and his expectations for his athletes were not where I, I felt comfortable being.  You know my thing was I'm, I'm not a dumb jock, I actually can read and write, I'm pretty smart.  So when you want me to take these kind of courses, I'm not taking these kind of courses, I'm better than that, and so that didn't last very long.  I, I probably played with him for about a month and then I said, "You know what, I don't need this," and I kind got hurt my, my, my leg as well.  So I, it sh- it was probably the best thing that happened for me, because I was able to get back on track to what I felt my academic abilities were.   As opposed to the course curriculum that they were trying to give me.
Speaker 1: Yeah it, it was the end of an era for Houston basketball anyway.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And there's even a, it's a '30 for 30' ESPN--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --documentary just on last month about Phi Slama Jama ['30 for 30: Phi Slama Jama'] and, and some of the athletes that played before Guy Lewis and you know the whole drama (laughter) of the NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association] tournaments and such.
Story_ID: 671081
Speaker 1: So you decide not to, not, not to play and, and, you know, focus on academics. So, so did you major in political science [at the University of Houston, Houston, Texas]?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'll tell you it was a little tough because you know I played basketball all my life, and then when October rolls around and I'm not playing basketball I'm going whoa what's going on?  So I, I, I kind of focused on political science, there was a guy by the name of Richard Murray who was a political analyst in, in Houston [Texas].  And he was very involved in politics and I started kind of following Richard Murray.  And then Mickey Leland, Congressman Mickey Leland developed a program where he was sending minority students to Washington, D.C. to do congressional interns.  And I, I was able to get some information regarding that and went through the process and you know I had a pretty good GPA [grade point average].  And was able to be selected at, as one of the people, Mickey Leland interns, to go to Washington, D.C. and, and do a congressional intern.
Story_ID: 671082
Speaker 1: Now this is a dramatic turn of events and this is a big--'cause I think bef- your first, one of your first jobs is working at Dairy Queen, right?
Speaker 2: My very first job when I finished high school [Abraham Lincoln High School; Memorial High School, Port Arthur, Texas], I, I graduated on Wednesday, and Thursday morning I was picking up burgers at Dairy Queen (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And then, after that I, I, I did some work study on campus [University of Houston, Houston, Texas] and then my next job, I came home because my father [James C. Payne] had gotten sick, was sick.  And so I had to come home for the summer and worked at Kmart [Kmart Corporation] as a stocker and then my father passed away.  And so you know it became an issue because you know normally, again and remembering how I grew up, when you get to that age where you can make money, you're supposed to come home and make money for the family.  And I really had a turning point in my life where I, when my father passed away, should I now come home and take care of the family?  Because my mom [Jessie Hudson Payne] is still there and my younger brother's [Jason Payne] there, he's only ten years old, and you know I, I, I really had a hard time trying not to come home.  But my mom just said no, you know she wanted me to finish school and do what I need to get done.  And she said she would be fine, so I, I, I went back to school and, and probably was a little bit more focused than I was (laughter) before my father passed away, and my next job was in D.C. [Washington, D.C.]
Story_ID: 671083
Speaker 1: Okay, so tell us about that. Now you, did you like, spend like a semester there or a quarter or what was it?
Speaker 2: I spent the semester there, I was there in the spring of nineteen eighty- spring of 1989, I worked for Congressman Bill Lehman [William Lehman] of Dade County, Florida [Miami-Dade County, Florida].  Mickey--Congressman Lehman was, was very good at making sure that we worked for a variety of people.  And, and got the real experience of, of, of congressional interns, he didn't want us to come up there and be pages.  Which is you know just going around taking petitions to get signatures; he wanted us to get into the congressional mindset.  And, and basically work like a legislative assistant would of worked.  And so and they, he did that, I mean Congressman Bill Lehman, when I got there, I immediately did work like the legislative assistants would do.  I was meeting with the constituents, I was writing letters back to his, his people within his community.  I became the liaison for the Haitian African American, at that time black versus Haitian disputes with the, the Coast Guards [U.S. Coast Guard].  Back in 1989 they were deporting Haitians who were coming close to the sou- to the United States.  They would, they intercept them, the congressional--the Coast Guards would intercept them and send them back to Haiti.  Well of course when they intercept them, sent them back to Haiti, they would die on their way back and so there was a fight between the United States and the Haitian group as to what you should do with those Haitians that were coming over.  They didn't really have anyone in my congressman's area in Dade County, Florida who speak, who could speak on that issue.  And I became the person to deal with that issue with the Coast Guard and Haitians.  Now I'm twenty years old, twenty-one years old I'm having to go to Edison High School [Miami Edison Senior High School, Miami, Florida] which is the high school where the Haitians and the, and the blacks were having interactions.  I'm dealing with a lot of the Haitians elected officials and both I, at that time it was Ba- Baby Doc [Jean-Claude Duvalier] in, in, in authority.  My congressman worked for the, he was the federa- chairman of the Federal Aviation Committee [Federal Aviation Administration] which was during the Eastern [Eastern Air Lines] strike.  So we were having the Eastern strike at that time, I'm having to fly back and forth to Miami [Florida], I'm twenty years old, I understand Haitian government.  I understand you know cons, the, the Coast Guard's interactions and I'm the go to person in [U.S.] Congress for Dade County, Florida.  You can't ask for a better (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Probably the whole Haitian situation, you're probably the go- yeah.
Speaker 2: It was a great experience for me, I mean I'm, I remember flying to Marco Polo Hotel [Ramada Plaza Marco Polo Beach Resort, Miami, Florida] and I would fly back and forth you know almost every month.  To meet with the Haitian officials, meet with the Coast Guards, come back and report to my congressman, here's where we are.  And then when the congress of constituents would come up to meet with Congressman Lehman, I would be in the room.  Because I'm the guy so although I'm twenty, I'm from Port Arthur, Texas, I, I never studied Haitian government, I'm now the go between.  And it was an awesome, awesome experience for me, you know because when we, we had various bills that were put forth because I knew the bill, I would actually go to the various congress people.  I remember talking with Tip O'Neill, Speaker Tip O'Neill, he called and you know I'm sitting on the phone talking to him like, "Oh my god I'm talking to Tip O'Neill" (laughter).  But you know I knew the information, it was my bill, you know I wouldn't say it was my bill, but I drafted the thing.  So (laughter) it was a great, great experience and, and I was coming from an area where Congressman Jack Brooks was very high in the judiciary on the, he was chairman of the judiciary committee [U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary].  And so my congressman, Congressman Bill Lehman and Congressman Jack Brooks had a good relationship.  And, and because I was from Jefferson County [Texas], I could always go see Congressman Brooks.  So he could always get me bypa- could bypass me to the people that I really need to talk to, so I start learning to play the Washington politics at twenty.  Okay, I got this congressman, I got this chairman, this chairman can get me to this guy, then I can get somebody to review my bill or, or my congressman's bill.  And then I figured out who the players are in Dade County, Florida that need to come up to help me sit through the congressional insight when they do the, the bill, bill review.  So that I got the right players sitting at the table asking- answering the right questions, you just start playing politics.  And that's the kind of experience I received at twenty years old.
Speaker 1: Yeah that's incredible (laughter) you think you know, it's scary too although, a twenty year old is given that kind of you know.  But that's you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's Washington [D.C.].
Speaker 1: Yeah but, yeah we have--we often interview people that find themselves in a situation that they couldn't've imagined like just a year before.  And here you are at a Dairy Queen--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --flipping burgers and now you're like the Haitian go to person in Congress.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 671084
Speaker 1: How many years did you work in that program that you?
Speaker 2: One ye- just one year, I almost didn't come home, because I, one thing about D.C. [Washington, D.C.] it, it is very addictive.  You know when you're twenty years old and you have the kind of, I don't wanna say authority.  But the power I was given, you don't wanna leave that (laughter), you know, I could go into any reception.  I could go into any function, I mean you know I could just call and say, "Hey I'm, I'm here on behalf of Congressman Bill Lehman [William Lehman]."  I could walk in any room I wanted to, well now you're asking me to leave this and come back to University of Houston [Houston, Texas]?  I mean I didn't wanna leave the authority, I didn't wanna leave it.  But I start noticing most of the people that were in [U.S.] Congress had law degrees, and now, you know they were like you, you know still go ahead and get your law degree.  So I, at one point I thought about transferring to Georgetown [Georgetown University, Washington, D.C.] and finishing up there.  But I was on full scholarship at University of Houston, so it didn't really make sense for me to pay to go to Georgetown, when I was on full academic scholarship at University of Houston.  So I went back to the University of Houston and hurried up to finish, so I finished University of Houston in three and a half years.  Because I was itching to get back to D.C., but once I got back home, I said, "Okay, let me go ahead and go to U of H and then get myself ready for law school."  And then I applied to Georgetown [Georgetown University Law Center, Washington, D.C.] and I applied to University of Houston Law Center [Houston, Texas], really wanted to go to Georgetown so I could get back to D.C.  And I got a full scholarship to go to Univer- University of Houston law school, so I stayed.
Story_ID: 671085
Speaker 1: You graduated in '89 [1989] with a bachelor's degree in pol- political science.  Now, you be- you joined Alpha Phi Alpha [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity] too on campus, and what other organizations were you involved in were you, did you have time to do very much?
Speaker 2: I, I, I pledged Alpha Phi Alpha as a freshman, which is not normal for most colleges, but the University of Houston [Houston, Texas] allowed it.  And so I really got active in Alpha Phi Alpha. I, I, I participated in just about every program, national program that they had.  I was a member of Golden Key [Golden Key International] and, and some of the other honor fraternities, pol- political science, the pol- political science department, but I really wasn't very active, I was active with Alpha Phi Alpha.  And I was very active with my church, I was with Brentwood Baptist Church [Houston, Texas] at that time, and between church, Alpha, grades, and I was commuting.  Because again my mom [Jessie Hudson Payne] was taking care of my brother [Jason Payne], and my dad [James C. Payne] had passed away so I would commute back and forth from Houston to Port Arthur [Texas], which is about an hour and half drive.  And when I say commuting I meant you know I would leave school at four, I would be home back in Port Arthur by six [o'clock].  I stayed home in Port Arthur until about ten o'clock, take care of stuff at the house, drive back to Houston [Texas].  And I would do that three or four times a week, so that pretty much took care of my lifestyle (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay all right you're very, very busy.
Story_ID: 671086
Speaker 1: University of Houston law school [University of Houston Law Center, Houston, Texas] next, right? So tell us about the law school experience.
Speaker 2: Law school was, was an eye opening experience for me socially I, I developed for the first time in my life white friends.  You know again from elementary [Franklin Elementary School, Port Arthur, Texas], junior high [Woodrow Wilson Junior High School; Woodrow Wilson Early College High School, Port Arthur, Texas] and high school [Abraham Lincoln High School; Memorial High School, Port Arthur, Texas] I had no whites ever around me other than those who our, I was competing against.  And when I got to University of Houston [Houston, Texas] I was around either the athletes or members of Alpha Phi Alpha [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity].  And we just kind of stayed together, I mean I was around other whites and I knew some of them, I didn't consider them friends, we were just around each other.  When I got to law school I had friends, some real true friends that were white, and it was just an eye opening experience for me.  I, I, I just I'd never experienced that so it was great, we had some challenges because you know one of my friends was a very, very conservative country western guy.  I had another white friend who was an R and B, liberal (laughter) which was kind of weird.  We just had, we had a very eclectic law school group let me say it that way, and you if, if I'm drive, I'm riding with this guy.  We're listening to country western and Alan Jackson and all of the stuff were in his car.  Okay when we're in his car we're listening to something else, we're in my car, I love Watercolors [Sirius XM Watercolors] and, and Najee and Kenny G.  So we just we were very, it was a very eclectic group and it was also during the time of the Rodney King beating.
Speaker 1: So this is like 1990?
Speaker 2: Nineteen ninety [1990].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And so I'm in law school.
Speaker 1: So Rodney King for those who are watching this a hundred years from now (laughter), he was, he was pulled over.  He was a black man driving a car in Los Angeles [California].  And pulled over for and they, they were, they were chasing actually his car (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: Right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And they--
Speaker 2: And they, they pulled him over and they just beat him, the police, and what really bothered me because I had that experience personally.
Speaker 1: Where the police beat you?
Speaker 2: Well, well they were very aggressive.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I was at University of Houston [Houston, Texas] me and some friends and I--we were together and, and the police pulled us over and just started really messing with us, Houston Police Department.  Bunch of cops came around and it was probably five or six of us, they took us out of the car and put our faces in the grass.  And, and you know frisking us and making sure we didn't have anything on us.  And then one of my friends had a like a banana or something and, and they just start screaming, what the, blah, blah, blah, blah, pumped those shotguns down and put them in our necks.  And, and I knew, and if you moved they were gon- they were gonna kill us.  I mean and the, and the, and the guns were pressed so hard up against my neck, our necks that it left a whelp, the circle was on our neck the next morning.  That, I mean it and they pushed our faces into the grass and did all of these mean cruel things.  And, and, and didn't, then they'll and they're laughing about it and, and you know you're angry, and you wanna do something but you know they have badges.  And they're gonna win and so the best thing you can do is get home, so you don't say anything.  You just, just deal with it.  And then you know they bust your headlight, tell you get in the car and drive off and then when you drive off and get on the public ro- ro- roadway, they give you a ticket for having a busted light.  That kind of stuff, so I had experienced that and you can be angry, but there was nothing you could do.  We didn't have camera phones back then to video what was going on, it's, it's our word versus the police department.  And back then in '88 [1988] they win, automatically.  So now you have the Rodney King episode where a very similar thing is taking place, but someone actually has, have their video camera out.  And they are videoing Rodney King being beaten by the police department and the world is going crazy, oh I can't believe, I can't believe.  While we're saying this been happening, but we finally got it on tape so that now you can see it, because we've been seeing it, we've been experiencing it.  And I'm taking constitutional law and criminal law and I remember when the verdict came out and the officers were all found to either be not guilty or a no plea against the officers.  And I remember being on the basketball court [Susanna Garrison Gymnasium, Houston, Texas] when it happened, I'm sitting here going it's--even the video tape is not enough.
Story_ID: 671087
Speaker 1: I remember the explanations of the, of that you weren't really seeing what you were looking at.
Speaker 2: Ex- yes and, and I--I remember, I remember being, I was at Garrison Gym [Susanna Garrison Gymnasium, Houston, Texas] when the ca- when the verdict came out, and I was with my con- very conservative law friend.  And we were playing basketball and I just stopped and I was just frustrated.  Because I'm saying, "I've been there, they do it, they get away with it and we finally had the evidence, and they still got away with it.  Why am I in law school?"  I mean I, I had to leave the gym because you know I'm sitting here trying to learn justice.   And I'm going, "It doesn't matter even if we've got it on tape, we can't win in America, justice is not for us, not here."  And it took me a long time (laughter) to get back (laughter) in where I, I felt like you know what you gotta be more.  It's gotta be so clear that no one can challenge it and it was hard, it was really hard for me to get back into to, to where I was ready to deal with constitutional law again.  Because I just felt like the system failed us.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is 1990 and (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's 1990.
Story_ID: 671088
Speaker 1: Now was the, the first year of law school difficult for you?
Speaker 2: It was my first year of law school.
Speaker 1: And was--was it a difficult year? They always say the first year is tough, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) First year is, is ridiculously hard, but it was harder for me because one, I did not have a strong, as strong English background as I should have, that was my fault.  Two, with my adjustments socially, because my friends now are the type of friends that I'm not used to having, and they're all I've got now.  Because when you're in law school, that's your new family, so the fraternity [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity] kind of had to be put on the side.  Because there was a kind of job I wanna have and for me to get this job I gotta finish at the top of my class.  And based on my life, I can't be where they are, I gotta be better than my, my colleagues.  So I've gotta finish at top of my class and be at the very best of my game if I wanna get the kind of jobs that they're gonna have.  So that's what I did.
Speaker 1: So were you in a, a study group with wh- white students then?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I had, we had one, I had one black female and really three whites.
Speaker 1: Okay and what about what size of class did you come in with?
Speaker 2: Was eighty in my section, eighty students in my section and there were five, four sections so we, we're looking at 320 in our entering law school class.  We had one of the largest black classes entered University of Houston [University of Houston Law Center, Houston, Texas] I think ever, and it was probably twenty-two blacks.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's not a lot.
Speaker 2: Oh but that was large back then I mean it's I know what it is today but that was a large entering black class.  But there were only three blacks in my class of eighty students, so you know (laughter) the numbers make it a little hard to populate amongst your own.
Story_ID: 671089
Speaker 1: Who were some of the--were, were there any particular teachers that were like mentors or, or role models for you?
Speaker 2: In law school [Houston University Law Center, Houston, Texas], not one.  My professors I felt treated me like I expected them to treat me, and I was going to outperform them in spite of.  Now not my law school classmates but my professors and I was going to win in spite of it, and I did.  I was, I did fairly well in law school.
Speaker 1: Are there any stories from that period of time about that kind of?
Speaker 2: I had a, a property professor who did, I didn't think wanted, necessarily wanted me in the classroom.  Or felt I probably got in for some affirmative action reason, I don't know, I don't know what his reason was, let me just say it this way.  I just felt that he didn't necessarily want me in the classroom, and they were, he had his back writing on the, the, the board.  And the guy behind me asked a question said, "I, I have a question," and he turned around and looked at me and said, "I will get to your question in a moment."  It wasn't me who asked the question.  I mean he was just rude to, everybody in the class was like really what's the deal?  So he goes back and he finishes asking- writing what he wants to write and then gets to me, he turns around and he says, "Now what can I help you with Mr. Payne [HistoryMaker James E. Payne]?"  I said, "I didn't ask the question (gestures) (pause), that was Mr. LaPorte [ph.]." "Oh, Mis- Mr. LaPorte what can I do for you?"  And you know everybody was kind of like, "Okay, I see," I, I and I, I just, I said, okay, at the end of the day you're gonna give a scantron.  And that scantron is gonna have my numbers, it's gonna have just a, a, a letter or a number.  Because we didn't have names assigned to it and I'm gonna make sure I make an A in your class, just because, and I did.  I you know and, and it wasn't shocking because I had that before where you know the professor would call out the A's in the class.  "Oh we have an A from John, you know, have an A in, in logics; we have an A from, Such and Such."  So I get my paper and he didn't call out the name, so I assume I don't have the A, and then I look and I've got an A.  And I'm going well why didn't you call my name, you called everybody else's name?  And so we, you know you leave out of class and everybody say, "Hey what did you get, what did you get?"  And you say, "Well I got an A." "We didn't hear your name." "He didn't wanna call my name, I'm okay."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I still got my A.
Story_ID: 671090
Speaker 1: Did you focus on liability cases in--in law school [University of Houston Law Center, Houston, Texas]?
Speaker 2: No, in law school I just focused on trial.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't know exactly what type of work I wanted to do focus wise, I just knew I wanted to do trial work.  And so I was very active in the moot court and mock trial competitions as a first year, which generally is not something that first years do.  I competed with a lot of the intramural mock trial competitions and moot court competitions.  My partner Jim Perdue, Jr. [Jim M. Perdue, Jr.] and I competed against a lot of the third year and second year law students and we, we were very successful.  At first it was a joke like, "Aye, I hear you and Jim won your, your round," and then we kept winning.  And next thing you know we're in the semifinals, and everybody's like, okay take these guys serious.  And then as a result of that, both of us received a lot of school credit, for a lack of a better word, where now we're on the mock trial teams and moot court teams for the school.  And we started do that as, as first years, and that just kept going while I was in law school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you established yourself and went on through so, so you didn't really focus at all on the personal injury stuff (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not at all--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I wanted to go work at Vinson and Elkins [Vinson and Elkins LLP] that was what I knew that I want to do before I start law school.  It was a, it was a big law firm it was in Houston [Texas], lot of lawyers and I knew my chances of getting there were very slim.  Because of the five hundred something lawyers, they only had five blacks, so I knew I needed to be in the top of the class.  And I needed to do something to kind of shine, my grades were great, but I needed to have something that make me shine.  And what would make, what made me shine was my moot court, mock trial experience, I was doing a mock trial argument and one of the partners on the hiring committee was the judge.  And so he asked me, he saw me compete, and he said, "Hey are you interested in coming to Vinson and Elkins or applying to Vinson and Elkins?"  I said, "Of course."  And that's how I kind of got into the door at Vinson and Elkins.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. So you received your J.D. in 1993--
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 671091
Speaker 1: Is The Order of Barristers the moot court?
Speaker 2: Order of the Barristers [sic.] really is your kind of creme de la creme of moot court, mock trial.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) From law school [University of Houston Law Center, Houston, Texas].
Speaker 1: That's what I thought.  Okay, so, so you indeed were hired by Vinson and Elkins [Vinson and Elkins LLP] right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: In 1993, right out of, you were like twenty-five, I guess?
Speaker 2: I'm twenty-five when I, I go to Vinson and Elkins.
Speaker 1: Okay all right, so tell us about Vin- Vinson and Elkins.
Speaker 2: Vinson and Elkins, at that time one of largest defense firms in the country, 535 lawyers, I was one of the fi- I think I was the fifth or sixth black that they had hired at that time.  So it wasn't a whole lot of us, I was put in litigation, the leta- the litigation section.  And you know, you know a lot of these guys who are at V and E they, it's called V and E, were you know top 10 percent, top 5 percent of their class.  And so you know they come from all of these great universities, Ivy Leagues and stuff like that.  Well when they put us in litigation at Vinson and Elkins they send all of their first year lawyers to litigation training where they train you to do litigation.  Well it was basically mock trial, which is, was my bread and butter.  So we would go into training sessions and I would come out and everybody would be just, "Oh my god you gotta meet this guy.   This kid James Payne [HistoryMaker James E. Payne], James Payne, James Payne."  And my, my, my supervising attorney would come and say, "Hey, I been hearing great things you in the training facility."  Well I mean it was, it was, I mean this is what I do and so you know a lot of these bookworms were trying to figure out how do you get a photo into evidence?  And they're trying to ask the right questions with please identify and they've got their little sticky of what they're supposed to ask.  Well I can do that top of my head I just grab, you familiar with exhibit number one and I just go through the, the, the questions.  And I get it into evidence, this time your honor I offer exhibit number one into evidence, I tend it to opposing counsel, and I would do it seamless.  And then the, the, the attorneys were watching this, they were, "Oh my god, he was flawless.  He very poised and confident," da, da, da, da, da, da, da, this is what I did; I was a mock trial guy.  And so it allowed me to get some exposure at Vinson and Elkins when you've got an entering class of you know eighty something people.  To get immediately recognized and it was, and I was recognized because of my trial experience.
Story_ID: 671092
Speaker 1: You passed the Texas Bar [State Bar of Texas] the same year and--?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay do, do you, you, you passed some other bar admissions too, right that, that the same year?
Speaker 2: It wasn't the same year when I, I, I left and came to Provost Umphrey [Provost Umphrey Law Firm LLP] in '95 [1995] and then at some point thereafter, I became board certified and that requires another test.  You have to have a certain amount of trials; you have to take a certain amount of statements and all the other stuff qualifications beyond your bar.  And I passed the board certification test as a personal injury, specializing in person injury.  And also received a board certification in civil trial and since then have received another board certification in pretrial litigation.
Speaker 1: Okay now one of the reasons we have down here that you went to Provost and Umphrey is the other firm didn't allow new lawyers to participate in trials.
Speaker 2: Right I, when I, Walter Umphrey, who's the managing partner of Provost Umphrey at the time asked me to come to Vinson and Elkins [Vinson and Elkins LLP], I mean to leave Vinson and Elkins and come to Provost Umphrey, the head managing partner of Vinson and Elkins called me from London [England] and said, "Hey what, what's wrong what, why you leaving?"  I said, "Well, I wanna try lawsuits and y'all, you guys are not letting me try lawsuits.  And these people down in Beaumont [Texas], they're telling me I can try lawsuits," you know. I felt my edge at V and E, Vinson and Elkins was my ability to try lawsuits.  That, that's what separated me from the pack and now I'm not being allowed to do that, and so some of the people who came out of law school [University of Houston Law Center, Houston, Texas] with me who are trying cases, they're catching up to me.  Because I'm not in a courtroom, and I don't want them to catch up to me, I mean I distanced myself for a purpose, I wanna keep that distance.  And so I left V- Vinson and Elkins and came over here to Provost Umphrey and I've been here ever since.
Story_ID: 671093
Speaker 1: Your area of practice, correct me if I'm wrong, has been personal injury, products liability, industrial worksite accidents, automobile accidents and premises liability, right?
Speaker 2: That's been my practice for the last twenty-one years now.  I practice exclusively on the plaintiff's side now.  I used to represent corporations, Exxon [Exxon Mobil Corporation], Colonial Pipeline [Colonial Pipeline Company], Mori Seiki [DMG Mori Seiki Company Ltd; DMG Mori Company Ltd] at representing corporations who manufacture the machines.  And now I represent the people who've been injured by those machines, so I've stayed in this same area, I've just switched the sides of the docket now.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay now, well can you talk about any of the cases, I mean maybe not.
Speaker 2: I can't really go into a whole lot of details about the cases, I can tell you my experience at Provost Umphrey [Provost Umphrey Law Firm LLP]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --was a little different because when I first came here there were no black lawyers, none of the plaintiff's firms had black lawyers.  So I was, I was really questioned by a lot of people in this community; lawyers, judges.  And this is in 1995 you know the, the most of the white lawyers could go in and say, "Well judge the case of Such and Such says I should win.  Because of this premise." And the judge says, "Okay," but when I say, "The case of Such and Such says I should win," I've gotta show him the case.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Credibility you're, you're discredited by being black just because you walk in the door black.
Speaker 2: Right I, I, I didn't have, I couldn't go and just say, "Well it says this judge," and you know I, I gotta show the judge.  "This is what the case says, I've shepardized the case, I've researched the case it hasn't been overturned.  And it says I win," you know and I, you know I had to do that a lot and I'm sitting here going, these guys don't even have any case law and they're winning?  And I'm showing you cases before I could even, you know get there, and I had to overcome that and to be honest overtime, I have been able to overcome it.  Because now I do go in and just kind of say judge you know the case says, and I've established the creditability.  But when I first got here, there weren't any black lawyers, there were one- there was one--that really specialize in only in personal injury.  The black lawyers who were here did a little of everything they some criminal, some family, I was the one who came in and said nope.  I'm doing nothing but personal injury, and that was not really expected, matter of fact when I came here, there were no black board certified lawyers, ever in Jefferson County [Texas].  I was probably not the first or second, probably the first or second board certified lawyer in personal injury in Jefferson County, ever.
Story_ID: 671094
Speaker 1: Now there's a, there's a case Matthews Smith and others versus Star Enterprises [Matthews Smith, et al. v. Texaco, Inc., et al., 1997], can you discuss that, now?
Speaker 2: Yes it was a discrimination case following Roberts versus Texaco [Roberts v. Texaco, Inc., 1997] where African Americans had gotten to what they consider a glass ceiling, and wouldn't allow them to go beyond that.  And a gentleman, a CEO or a person high in authority basically stated that the reason why blacks get to a level and can't go any further is because they're like black jellybeans.  That that are just stuck at the bottom of the jar, and that's where they ought to be.  Well fortunately that statement was actually caught on tape and when that statement was recorded, a lawsuit arose, for Roberts versus the State- Roberts versus Texaco.  Where salary, African Americans sued Texaco for not allowing them to go beyond this glass ceiling, and making sure that they were stuck at the bottom of the jar.  Like the black jellybeans as articulated by management.  Out of that spent- that's Roberts versus Texaco.  Texaco [Texaco, Inc.] had another entity called Star Enterprise where the same people made the same decisions on management decisions for salaried employees.  I represented the class action group of the salary employees against Star Enterprise via Texaco.   And Matthew Smith [Matthews Smith] was the main plaintiff in the class action, and I was the class counsel.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay and this was a racial discrimination case basically and so how did you I guess, did you have like, like a pool together the, the class against (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes we, actually met in this conference room and started from here and then as we what, as I went around the country, I, I was listening to more and more stories where people were hitting the glass ceilings.  And not being given an opportunity and then I brought the class action against Star and Texaco in the Eastern District [United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas] of, of, of Jefferson County [Texas] in federal court and was in front of Judge Harold Cobb [sic. Howell Cobb].  And it was kind of again David and Goliath; it was me versus about twenty lawyers.  I'm probably a fifth year lawyer and I've got guys who've been practicing law for thirty, forty years.  And I'm telling you they're from every big law firm in the State of Texas, and it's me.  And you know I'm having to put on evidence and they've got the, I mean the other side of the courtroom literally twenty, twenty-five, lawyers it's me and a guy named Chris Kirchmer [Christopher T. Kirchmer] and, and John Cowan whose doing the brief writing and that's it, and we're fighting them.  And the interesting thing going back to what makes me a trial lawyer, these guys were smart, but they hadn't been the courthouse.  They're in trial lawyers, they weren't trial lawyers, they were, they were drafters, they were businessmen, I'm a trial lawyer.  So when we got ready start putting on evidence, and presenting evidence to the court as to the discrimination, I was having fun, 'cause this is what I do.  I, I this is what I do; I can demonstrate through cross examination that your actions have been discriminatory.  Your policy on face doesn't say I won't promote African Americans, but your implementation of that policy I can show has a disparate impact on people of color.   And I was able to show that through examples and cross examinations and, and all of these lawyers on the other side, they were book smart, but they hadn't been in the courtroom.  And so I was able to use my courtroom experience to override their policies.
Story_ID: 671095
Speaker 1: So their defense was merely that the poli- there's no policy that discriminates--
Speaker 2: That, that was the position, there was no policy that discriminated, but I was able to show that your imple- your practices had a disparate impact.  Because you could see people who were similar situated individuals when you compare their tenure to their counterparts.  They were not only at a higher pay grade with higher income, it was grossly disproportionate.  For someone who came in at the same time, same background their salary reviews were always lower.  Their, their, everything was just, you, you could just clearly see that once an African American got to a certain level that was it, that was the glass ceiling.  And we had to be able to break that glass ceiling, and the decisions that were being made by management.  These same people who said blacks should remain at the back, bottom of the, the jar like black jellybeans.  These were the people who are deciding whether or not you, you went from this pay grade and went beyond that pay grade.  And clearly they had an impression that we ought to remain at the bottom, because that's what they said on tape.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, so there's a set- there was a settlement from like nine- $9 million plus right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We settled the case for little, little over $9 million.
Speaker 1: Okay and--
Speaker 2: For those cla- those class members.
Speaker 1: And, yeah so all that was divided amongst the class?
Speaker 2: Yes, an opinion was reached and rendered by Judge Cobb [Howell Cobb] basically confirming that I represented the class and the class settlement was in the best interest of the class representatives.
Speaker 1: Okay, that was in nine- 2001, '2 [2002], 2000?
Speaker 2: It would've been in 2000 'cause (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --I'd just become a senior partner.
Story_ID: 671096
Speaker 1: Tell us about--now, I have a note here that you received a NBTA certification, National Board of Trial Ad- Advocacy [National Board of Trial Advocacy], as a certified civil trial advocate.  Now what does that mean and--?
Speaker 2: That's similar to the board certification by the Texas State board of certification [Texas Board of Legal Specialization] that means you have reached a level of excellence.  You've tried a certain amount of cases and many times with Texas board of specialization you actually have to go to Austin [Texas] take another test.  You'll see many times in whatever state you practice, they'll say you, you see a lawyers advertising saying, "Hey I can help you, I can help you."  And then at the very bottom in real, real smart print it'll say, "Not board certified by the board of specialization."  That's a requirement that says you have not reached that level of sus- specification.  And I look at it like this, if you, you have a heart problem, you can go see an internal medicine or you can go see a cardiologist.  You have a heart problem you go see a cardiologist 'cause they're specialized in cardiology.  The same thing I see when it comes to personal injury, you can go see a lawyer, you have a personal injury.  Or you can go see someone who specializes in personal injury.  To me I'd go to someone who specializes.  So I want to make sure I got certification and board certified because again I understand 90 percent of the lawyers are not board certified.  But I need to be in that exclusive, exclusive group because if I'm gonna be competitive, I gotta se- I gotta be better.  And so I made sure I was board certified not only personal injury, the national trial advocacy.  I have board certification in civil trial, and then also have national board certification by civil trial of national board certification in pretrial litigation.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: Now all of this, in 2003 you're identified as a Texas Super Lawyer now what does this mean?
Speaker 2: That is a very, that was probably one of the biggest honors I've received since I've been practicing in that you are nominated by your peers.  The lawyers in Texas decide who they recognize as the top 5 percent lawyers in the State of Texas.  That is not something that you can buy into, they nominate and I have been recognized as a Texas Super Lawyer since nine- 2003, which is when they started Texas Super Lawyer.  And I've been recognized every since, and in 2003 I'm not sure but I think I was probably the only African American in the State of Texas that received that designation in 2003.  And I've had that designation ever since.
Story_ID: 671097
Speaker 1: Now you're also a member of the Million Dollar Advocates Forum. Now what is that?
Speaker 2: Ever since 1997, I have had either a settlement or trial verdict that has been in excess of a million dollars.  And, and it's basically a, a group of people like myself who've had settlements, verdicts in excess of a million dollars.  And then when you start getting multiple cases, there's a Multi-Million Dollar Advocates Forum which I'm also a member of.
Speaker 1: So these are the, the personal injury cases and that sort of thing, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah are, were, are you unique amongst lawyers in having been the recipient of a settlement for per- personal injury yourself as a (pause) (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I wouldn't say I'm unique, there are other lawyers who do it, I can tell you there are very few of us that, that are of color--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that are in that group, and that's you know it's just; it's just what it is.  The problem we have quite frankly for instance now most of my clients are white, because blacks still think that if I wanna get me a good lawyer, I gotta go hire me a white lawyer.  Now I've got you know I can put my resume up against anybody in Southeast Texas I- anybody.  And if you didn't know I was black, if I took off Alpha Phi Alpha [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity], if I took of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] stuff you didn't know I was white, I was black.  Most blacks would hire me on the spot, but we've been conditioned to think that if I need a good lawyer, I gotta go get me a white lawyer.  Now whites on the other hand, most of the whites around here, they look at the resume, they want the best lawyer they can find.  And so when they look at my resume, and they compare it to other resumes, they are like I need him (points).  And actually one of the first cases (laughter) I got the, the Fawbockers [ph.] they were from Vidor [Texas] and which is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's the Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK] (unclear)?
Speaker 2: That's the home of the Klan.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And I walked in and they obviously weren't expecting to see me, obviously I wasn't expecting them to expect see me.  'Cause they, they were asking for me from Vidor, and, and they just, when they say they were from Vidor, they made it very clear.  "We don't care what color you are, I heard you're the best, and we want you."
Speaker 1: That's interesting. Yeah, that's interesting scenario.
Speaker 2: Now so I'm getting white clients from Vidor but I can't get blacks from my own hometown because they think they just gotta get a white lawyer. And it wasn't 'til very recently that those multimillion dollar settlements and verdicts that I've received have actually been for people of color.  Most of my clients have been white.
Story_ID: 671098
Speaker 1: I don't know if you have any way of knowing but what, what percentage of the cases that black people you know where, where we're the victim.  What percentage of those cases do we actually, do we win the same rate as other people?  Or, or is there a discrimination across the (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The criminal side is much different, I know, I don't know, I can't tell you I have a percentage on the civil side.  I can tell you this, 'cause I do try a lot of lawsuits, race has a huge factor in the outcome of litigation.  Because if I try a case and I've got four blacks, eight whites on my panel, my jury, eight out of ten times, that verdict is gonna be split down racial lines, initially.  Now eventually they're gonna kind of barter back and forth but I'm te- eight out of ten times, the blacks are all together, the whites are all together.  And then somebody either has to give or take, but you know for anyone to sit here and say that race doesn't matter in, in 2016 in the court system.  I can tell you from someone who tries lawsuits daily that it does, and I can tell you that there is a, there is a case called Batson that prevents lawyers from using racially motivated attempts to strike jurors.  For instance, if I have a jury panel and I've got twenty people, I get to pick three people that I get to strike for whatever reason.  The other side, gets to pick three people, they get to strike for whatever reason.  I can tell you, so many times I've tried cases where they have gone out and purposely struck the blacks, just because.  And so if, if they, if they do that, I can challenge that strike under Batson, because it violates the Fourteenth Amendment.  And I can tell you right now I'm currently probably the only lawyer in Southeast Texas that has gotten that affirmed.  Because I can prove, I've proven it on so many occasions where people are targeting people of color and I- not just people of color.  They are targeting people based on religion, sometimes gender, they figure if I got a black- a, a female plaintiff, I bet not have any females on my jury, so they strike all females.  If I got a black plaintiff, I got strike all the black pla- black jury members, can't have a black listening to a black on the plaintiff.  And then you're telling me but I'm supposed to be judged by my peers, a jury of my peers?  This doesn't look like my community, I can tell you I've tried many cases in Jefferson County [Texas] where 47 percent of this community is black, but I got an all-white jury.  And you try figure out how do I, this isn't a jury of my peers, what happened, well the lawyer on the other side struck all the blacks, so I got an all-white jury, listening to a client whose black, that's what happens, and I challenged that under Batson versus United States [sic. Batson v. Kentucky, 1986].  And I've been able to be successful in winning that argument.
Story_ID: 671099
Speaker 1: Is there a local chapter of the National Bar Association?
Speaker 2: There is, it's not as active as the one in Houston [Texas] I was--the, the one in Houston--I, I'm a national member of the National Bar Association.  But there's not a local, local affiliate.
Speaker 1: Okay, and National Bar Association is the black lawyers.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Are, are there vi- many other black lawyers in Beaumont [Texas]?
Speaker 2: There are forty-three in Jefferson County [Texas], it's amazing we have a very high number but very few of them do what I do exclusively.  They do a little criminal, little family, a little this, a little that, you know, and because of the politics in Jefferson County it makes them hard to compete on some of the bigger cases.  Because politically they just, they're bullied out.
Speaker 1: What's the name of the local branch of the National Bar Association?
Speaker 2: Jefferson County Bar Association.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Jefferson County Black Law- Law Suit--Law Association, Lawyers Association [Jefferson County Black Lawyers Association].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right it's good to know that and how, how far back does that history go?
Speaker 2: Well it's been here since I was here, since in 1995, but the, the, the power of that organization has certainly gone upward, up and down.  The, Theodore Johns [Theodore R. Johns, Sr.] was a, a trailblazer of blacks in this community for as fighting for discrimination and things of that nature.  I had the pleasure of meeting him, Mr. Willard [Elmo R. Willard III] as well, I did not chance, have a chance to meet Mr. Willard, but I did meet the Theodore Johns before he passed away.  And they were the trailblazers for civil rights and civil litigation in Jefferson County [Texas].
Story_ID: 671100
Speaker 1: In 2005 you began the Buy 90 Campaign, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, for black operated businesses?
Speaker 2: Yes it was the first, in my opinion, statistically proven economic empowerment program in the country.  We've had a lot of people have economic empowerment programs to accent African American businesses around the country.  But no one had statistically proven, in my opinion, its affect and so you know we've had using two dollar bill, two dollar bills and showing your purchasing power.  We've had books like 'Power Economics' [sic. 'PowerNomics,' Claud Anderson] which I've read and things of that nature, I, I just it, it, it caught me when I, I start looking at Black Wall Street and tell, and what happened in Tulsa [Oklahoma].  That we have such, we have such great buying power, we needed to be able to show ourselves, not others.  Because we've been conditioned to think, that I gotta go buy somebody else's and I can't buy from my own.  And so I wanted to show really our own community that we can make us better if we just take care of ourselves.  And so what, you know when you look at the conservative platform, everyone says pull yourselves up by your bootstraps.  When you look at the liberal platform it will tell you try to, to better one another.  So what I basically did was create, I took the conservative platform and put a liberal social action program with it, in that we selected five businesses in Southeast Texas.  And I asked blacks to support those businesses for ninety days, again to condition their minds.  Created a black dollar bill with the businesses on the back, keep it in your wallet.  So that every time you opened up your wallet you ask yourself could you spend your green dollars in a black business?  Now it's just as a reminder, I had a statistician out of University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] to do an economic analysis.  Take January, February and March from the previous year and compare it to January, February and March from this year.  Take into consideration that there's going to be some increase for inflation, and then do an analysis to see how effective our Buy 90 Campaign was.  We had a bookstore, we had a restaurant, a car wash, a display center sale, sold various items then we had a gas station.  And I just asked the black business, I asked the blacks in the community support the, those five businesses for ninety days.  So when you buy gas, if you gonna get unleaded gas, go to one of ours, we only have one that we own in Southeast Texas.  Go buy gas from them, do it for ninety days, I wanna show you what will happen if we start supporting our own.  We're gonna and we, we've always heard the term their ice is colder than our ice, ice is ice.  You don't have to go across town to go buy the white man's ice, when the black guy is selling ice in your backyard.  But we'll go pay more, we, it's not them, we will go buy ice from the white man.  Because somehow we think their ice is colder, that's crazy.  So my thought was let's support our own businesses for ninety days see how effective it was, where' not asking for any special discounts.  So you don't think when you go in there and you got your black dollar bill you gonna get 10 percent off.  No, you're gonna get quality service for the quality of work being performed that business, the gas station sold out of gas five times in ninety days.  They had to put a sign out that just said we have no more gas, five times, the and then after we did that for ninety days, we did the sts- the statistical analysis and found out that we increased the profitability of those businesses by over 300 percent.  It was the first statistically proven economic empowerment program shown, and then it became, it received national attention.  You know 'Tom Joyner Morning Show' and, and other syndicates came out and said, you know, "How did you do it, what did you do, was it a promotional deal?  Did you do some special promotion?" No, I just encouraged our own to support our own, we have, we have buying power.  And I just got us to understand that, I went to the churches and asked the ministers to endorse the program.  Because that's the one place we still congregate every Sunday, and if I could get the ministers to support it, and I did, then I knew I could get the community behind it.  And that's what happened.
Story_ID: 671101
Speaker 1: Yeah that sounds like a significant program, and this is a issue that still is on a lot of peoples' minds, as we've (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Look it happens in every other community but ours and, and I'm not, I'm not upset with it, but the Vietnamese community, they support their own.  You go into and you go down to Port Arthur, Texas they have their own grocery stores, they have their churches.  The used their own people to hire, they, they, they have their own community, and their community thrives.  You go in the Hispanic community, their own grocery stores, they hire their own perts- people, they buy from their, their own.  The Pakistanians [sic. Pakistanis] do it, every community does it, except the blacks.  And then when I did the Buy 90 [Buy 90 Campaign] everybody start saying, "Well you're racist," said, "I'm not racist."
Speaker 1: Now did you get (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh I got--
Speaker 1: --criticism from black community about, about being a racist?
Speaker 2: I got it from black and white; I had some blacks who didn't, black businesses that didn't wanna participate, which was fine.  But my thing is I'm not being a racist, I want to show us that we have power, and then when we sit down at the table at, at the commerce center.  The various Beaumont commerce, Chamber of Commerce [Greater Beaumont Chamber of Commerce, Beaumont, Texas] and things of that nature, that we're sitting down with equal bargaining power.  So that when I ask to support your business and ask you to support my business, I'm not asking for a federal handout.  I'm not asking for some governmental grant, I have power, I've got bargaining power.  And if you recognize I've got bargaining power and buying power, now we're sitting down and having real dialogue, and you're not looking as if you're have- giving me a handout.  You're not giving me a handout, I got power, I've got bargaining power, and I had to get us to understand that.  Because we've been condition to think that we don't have power, and I had to change that, and so the Buy 90 concept was really to give us a shot in the arm, give us a shot in the arm.  That we've got the power in our community and that's what it was about.
Speaker 1: Okay all right, so, so there was no media campaign at all or noth- nothing in?
Speaker 2: I, I used only black media.
Speaker 1: Okay so lo- is there a local black newspaper?
Speaker 2: We had a local black paper, it's no longer in existence, and then my wife [Tracie Wilson Payne] and had CUSH Magazine.  And we basically advertised through CUSH and through the black media.  And, and the reason why I did that you say well sounds like you were kind of being discriminatory 'cause you didn't go to the white media.  I didn't go to the white media intentionally.  Because if I had done that then some could argue that the reason the numbers were inflated was because you used the white media and you just advertised heavy.  I only went to the black community because I wanted to reach out just to blacks; I wanted to, I wanted to focus.  You know we always have this, this shotgun approach, let's increase black support, I didn't wanna have a shotgun approach, I want to have a rifle approach.  We're going to target this community, we're gonna target these businesses, and we're going to show you what the buying power we have within our own community, and that's what we did.
Story_ID: 671102
Speaker 1: Now this is a problem that's, that goes back to, gosh it goes back to, you know, to our very beginnings in this country.  Where really that kind of dialogue in--but we've had every kind of business you can think of at one time or another.  And from the people I've interviewed they, they say the real blow came with integration (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --and blew a bad- black business districts compounded with like all our urban renewal--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --which many call Negro removal.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: In certain sections that, that's actually what brought down Black Wall Street, I mean the Tulsa [Oklahoma] community ur- urban renewal project that put an overpass over--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Greenwood [Avenue], Archer [Street] and Pine [Street].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So this is a, and you know our communities have been seen as opportunity communities for other communities that come in like the K- Koreans or the Vietnamese.
Speaker 2: Absolutely I, you know Black Wall Street obviously for those who don't know need to really read up on it.  But we had everything we need in old Black Wall Street, we had banks, we had, we had buildings, we had doctors, we had lawyers.  But we were supporting our own, but when we, you know, everybody talks about integration, to some extent integration was integrating them into us, and us out of us.  And you know now we don't need to go to our, our lawyers anymore, we gotta go find their lawyers, 'cause now I now have the opportunity.  You know it's so many so at--so such a long period of time, we couldn't get into their restaurants.  Because we were prevented from going, well then integration occurred that allowed us access into their restaurants.  And we was so happy that we got into their restaurants, we forgot about our own (laughter) so now we don't wanna deal with our restaurants anymore.  But we only wanna deal with their restaurants, and so we don't have any more businesses.  And so I, my, thing is to get us to start, if we're really gonna really get back to our power, we gotta start having our own facilities.  And so when, when conservatives were complaining about my Buy 90 Campaign, I said wait a minute, what's your complaint?  You said what we need to do is pull ourselves up by our bootstraps and quit asking for governmental assistance.  That's Buy 90, I didn't ask for any governmental assistance, we didn't ask for any federal grants.  What I said, I went to our people and said, "Pull yourselves up by your bootstraps, support your own.  What's your complaint?  It's exactly what you told me to do."
Story_ID: 671103
Speaker 1: Do you think in a, in a larger sense that, that black economic problems have to do with the fundamental question of black identity?  Are we a people or are we not, and if we are then what should we do as a people?  And if we're not then you know, what--?
Speaker 2: We have been conditioned to think that we are not and the problem we're having in this generation is to recondition our own to remind them that we are.  We have gotten so; we fought during civil rights so hard to be a part of, and to be included.  Now that we are included and we are a part of, we don't wanna have any more ownership.  We fought so hard to get in, now that we're in, what do we do?  We no longer want our own buildings, we no longer want our own schools, HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities] are going down now, because we're, we're fighting so hard to get into theirs, that we, we don't care about being in our own anymore.  And it, it, it's affecting our community, its affecting our livelihoods, we're so happy that a white lawyer will take our case.  We don't care about whether or not we got the most qualified lawyer anymore, we just them white.  So we'll pat- and, and this it's amazing because again I'm, I'm one of the few, I'm the only black partner at this law firm.  I have black clients that will come in this building and will not hire me; they will hire a white lawyer who works for me before they hire me.  Now it's crazy because it's still coming to me because I'm a partner here, but they want, they gotta have them a white lawyer.  So they, they will go hire somebody who works for me, it's a culture, it's a- we've been conditioned.  And what I'm trying to do is now recondition us, and it's not something that's gonna happen overnight.  It, it's taking decades to get us conditioned, and its gonna take some time to uncondition us.  And unfortunately many of us get you know frustrated, as I do, at times.  Because I'm sitting here going, why would you pass me up given my, my resume why would you pass me up?  And go hire somebody who's not as qualified as I am; but I gotta, I gotta remember they're just conditioned that way.  And I can't stop fighting.  We had, we you, you said getting our access, my wife [Tracie Wilson Payne] and I started a magazine, CUSH Magazine, where we were trying to uplift our community.  Blacks stop advertising in our magazine and the whites start advertising in the magazine, because they knew that they could reach forty thousand black people for cheap.  And I had, and we eventually stopped after ten years, but be, we wound up having more whites advertising in the black magazine than blacks advertising in their own magazine that was trying to reach out to our own people.

Speaker 1: Tell me about the development of CUSH Magazine and but, but first tell me how you met your wife and who she is and when you all got married (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My--my--
Speaker 1: Then we'll get into (laughter) CUSH Magazine.
Speaker 2: My wife and I met at a Kappa party (laughter) even though I'm an Alpha [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity], Kappa Alpha Psi [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity] party at Texas Southern University [Houston, Texas].  Her name's Tracie Yvonne Wilson Payne [Tracie Wilson Payne], T-R-A-C-I-E, Yvonne, Y-V-O-N-N-E, Wilson, W-I-L-S-O-N, Payne.  She was only sixteen, she went to college very early and we dated kind of, not completely dated, we're just friends.  And she went, eventually after spending some time at Texas Southern, she went to Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], spent some time at Spelman and then came back and finished at Texas Southern.  And then in on October 16, I better get this date right, 1993, we finally came back and said look, let's really start dating.  And then we got married on July 22, 1995, right before I moved back to Beaumont [Texas].  And so and we've been together ever since, we have three children, Caleb [James C. Payne II], Joshua [Joshua Payne] and Taryn [Taryn Payne].
Story_ID: 671105
Speaker 1: And now, now tell, tell me about CUSH Magazine. You, you and your wife [Tracie Wilson Payne] started this magazine, right?
Speaker 2: It was really my wife, and she was kind of the person that worked it up, myself and two other gentlemen, Robert Turner, Herbert Straughter.  We were just getting a lot of negative publicity in the press locally, nothing positive about people of color, just everything negative.  And so I said, "What could we do to create something that's positive about our people, nothing negative about whites.  Nothing negative about Hispanics, but just something positive about our community."  And so we created a magazine and we wanted to make sure, it was kind of like our local Jet magazine.  Where it was high gloss, all color, high quality, positive images about people of color (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Small like Jet too?
Speaker 2: S- similar, similar in size with Jet, so that we could highlight people of color.  Let's talk about the teacher, who got the special reward, award, let's highlight someone who just got a brand new house.  And it doesn't have to be you know a ten thousand square foot home, but a very nice house.  So we could have positive images of people of color became a very, very hot commodity in Jefferson County [Texas], you put it on a shelf and as quickly as you put it a shelf, it would be gone.  'Cause we gave it away, we didn't, we didn't charge anybody for the magazine, we just gave it away.  And it was started by, like I said myself, Robert Turner, Herbert Straughter, we put the money up.  My wife, friend and along with a lady by the name of Jessie Haynes, and we did it for ten years.
Speaker 1: Okay so how did you spell CUSH how was--?
Speaker 2: C-U-S-H.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Coming from the original biblical Cushites which were the first group of color recognized in the Bible.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right so it's ancient (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --quality to it.
Speaker 2: And it had kind of double meaning 'cause it was cushy, people thought oh that's where it came from, we were like, no that's not where it comes from.  It comes from the Cushites if you really wanna look at the biblical standpoint.
Speaker 1: Yeah sometimes spelled with a K too.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: The Cushites are historic people that are not just in the Bible but in other ancient texts.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And I mean real people that inhabited the area, south of Egypt.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what is now Nubia.
Speaker 2: And we had an article in the Cushite, in the CUSH Magazine that said let me give you the history of the Cushites.  And then I would write a, a column every, every month it was it, published every other month called 'The Truth.'  And the whole purpose of that article was to take an area and really hammer down on some hard issues about our people.  That would try uplift our people to become better citizens.
Story_ID: 671106
Speaker 1: The attempt was to galvanize people around positive images and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Positive images, that's it.
Speaker 1: --and messages. Okay.
Speaker 2: That was the, the whole de- purpose was to elo- elevate our people to higher level with high expectations.  Again you can't be what everyone else is, we can't be like the local magazine, we can't have local articles.  We have to elevate the articles, make them above and that's where people thought oh cushy, because it was all gloss.  You know a lot of times when, when people have African American magazines or African American newspapers, the front cover is, is color.  And then inside is black and white, that wasn't CUSH [CUSH Magazine], CUSH was all color, all glossy, high quality, high print.  We wanted to be creme de la creme.
Speaker 1: Now, now for instance would, would you cover in CUSH, now I know it's it, it doesn't exist anymore, right at, at the present, right?
Speaker 2: It does not.
Speaker 1: But in, in the days when it was coming out would you talk about something like Black Lives Matter or the police brutality issues or, or something like that?
Speaker 2: No, sometimes I would talk about our impact on our, our, our despaired impact on those issues, but it was- was- wasn't a situation where it was design to kind of get everybody all riled up.  You know I, I, I've never been a person that says let's just talk about issues, I ta- I try to talk about solutions.  And so if we're going to talk about race, we need to talk about how we resolve the solutions of racism.  And so you know one of the things that I you know people are saying that the magazine was racist or prejudice.  And so I, I wrote an article about maybe I am prejudiced.  And the reason why I wrote the article because I found myself supporting Tiger Woods, why?  Because he was black.  I wanted Tiger to do well, so yes am I supporting him because he's black yeah, I am.  I was supporting the, the, the coach who's the NFL [National Football League] coach because he was a black coach.  I wanted to see our people succeed, I wasn't anti your group, I just was proud of my own, and so if that makes me prejudice then, yes I am.
Speaker 1: You think that a person can argue that the white people that were for Tiger Woods were for him because of the--because he's black.  But also because of the justice implication of a black man playing golf in a white world?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, look when I did the Buy 90 Campaign I had whites supporting it I, I mean literally I had whites saying, "I like what you're doing, it makes sense, and I wanna get behind it."  I had whites carrying black dollar bills in their wallets, so that when they would go and have restaurants they said, "Wait let's see can we support a black business?"  Because they were su- they were behind the effort, you know people tho- say what they want.  But the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] you know, if it wasn't for the whites, we, we would not have had an NAACP where we were.  So this whole thought that it has to be exclusively blacks is ludicrous.  If we're going to strengthen our community, we have to strengthen the community as a whole.  But I was targeting our people of color, and I think yes, there are people who support Tiger because they wanted to see, they wanted to see a black play at Augusta [Augusta National Golf Club, Augusta, Georgia], because it's historically not allowed, it, yes they wanted that.  And I don't think that's racist to support a community, a culture.  I will love to see more Hispanics on the [U.S.] Supreme Court, am I anti-white? No, I just think our, our com- our community, our America is diversified.  And I would like to see our Supreme Court look like our community; I would like to see our [U.S.] Congress look like our community.  I'm not anti anybody else, I just think the community, our representatives ought to represent our community.  And right now that's not what, what we have.
Story_ID: 671107
Speaker 1: So now, now what led to the demise of CUSH I know, I know it's a, it takes energy to make anything exist.
Speaker 2: Two things (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And so.
Speaker 2: Technology.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: We, we became paperless and we start doing Internet and really I stopped it because whites were taking advantage of our community, of our magazine.  They want to have a local election; whites would come in put ads in CUSH Magazine so that they reach out to our people of color.  That was not the purpose of CUSH, it was never for profit, so I wouldn't let casinos into the magazine, I wouldn't let alcohol advertisers into the magazine.  We could've easily done that for profit because the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sure a lot of black newspap- papers make their--
Speaker 2: That's where they make the money.
Speaker 1: Made your money on car ads, cigarettes and alcohol.
Speaker 2: Wouldn't let it happen, and even one of the locre- local grocery stores want to be the exclusive distributor of the magazine.  And they were wanting to take out the centerfold and all that other stuff and, I said no, we're not gonna do that.  We're not gonna do that because it's not designed for profit, it is designed to educate our people and condition us that we can be good.  So we, my wife and I had just decided you know ten years that was been a good time.  And it, and, and you know people have asked us to bring it back.  If we do it, and we do come back it'll be more digital.
Story_ID: 671108
Speaker 1: So when did you get involved with the Boule?
Speaker 2: Came into the Boule in two thou- really at the start of 2001, I was not familiar with the Boule; I had never heard anything about it.  And I was invited to speak at an event for the Boule and I, even when I was asked to speak, I was like "Who am I speaking to?"  They said, "Well you're speaking to Sigma Pi Phi [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity]," I'm like "What is that?"  'Cause I do a lot of public speaking.  And I met some gentlemen that I, that I knew were pretty high in the community, and I that's became my introduction to the Boule.
Speaker 1: Okay now that being said, what is the Boule?
Speaker 2: Boule is an organization of, of likeminded men that have come together to do collectively what they could not do individually.  It was established in 1904 all, a lot of people think that Alpha Phi Alpha [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity] which I am a member, was the first black fraternity, that's not true.  The Boule, Sigma Pi Phi was established in 1904, it's the first, Alpha Phi Alpha is the first collegiate fraternity.  But the first fraternity was actually the Boule.  It was a group of men who came together who decided to do--to come together and, and talk about issues that were affecting them seemingly, and to address issues that they could not handle individually.  Most of the people who brought the Boule together were medical, in the medical field, they were trying to you know what's affecting the medical practice.  And if one community is affecting another, but where do you have those conversations, who can you talk to about that?  Well you really can't talk to some people who don't have similar situations, so these men came together and said hey, I'm having this issue, you're having this issue, how do we address that?  And they start coming together similar situated individuals who had issues that were affecting their practices.  And they divide- decided to come together and form an organization, which was Sigma Pi Phi, the Boule.
Story_ID: 671109
Speaker 1: So would we know any of the founders, his- historical figures?
Speaker 2: You probably, you know, Henry Minton [Henry M. Minton] was obviously the founder; you will probably not know any of the founding individuals, because they were really focused in the medical practice.  You will have many members of the Boule of Sigma Pi Phi [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity] that you would be familiar with that are also members of other collegian organizations, and have been civil rights leaders and things of that nature.
Speaker 1: Okay ba- back in those days, say somebody like Du Bois was he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) W.E.B. Du Bois was a, an archon, but he was founding member, but he was a member of the organization, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right and-
Speaker 2: Just about, I wouldn't say every, but almost every civil rights person that you would think that have done things of significance were also members.  Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], [HistoryMaker] John Hope Franklin you know like I said W.E.B. Du Bbois and, and the list will just go on and on.
Speaker 1: Was Booker T. Washington a member?
Speaker 2: I don't know if Booker T. Washington was and I'll tell you that the, the selection or you know Boule is a little different than like other organizations.  Which is why many times you'll hear or you will read stories about Boule that are not necessarily positive.  Because you can't join the Boule, you can't say "Hey (unclear)" (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So that's the difference between say the Boule and the--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --black fraternities and sororities
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: We know about like the Alphas [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity] or the Kappas [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Sigmas [Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity] you know.
Speaker 2: You, you, you cannot join the Boule, you're invited to be a part of the Boule, and a lot of people take that as that somehow they are elitist.  They are not, the Boule is not an elitist group, they are an elite group I will, I will never tell people that it's not an elite group.  It is an elite group but they're not elitist.  You have to have a degree, you, you, you, you know unlike other organizations where you come in and you, you're working on your degree, 99 percent of the members of the Boule actually have degrees.  And many of them multiple degrees--
Speaker 1: So you say that 99, does that mean that 1 percent does not?
Speaker 2: There are some who have been members who have not had a four year degree, they've had honorary degrees, and there are some exceptions for those individuals.  It is a group made of predominantly African American men, and not exclusively African American men.  There are some people who in the Boule that not Afri- are, are African American.
Speaker 1: Did they, did they what nationality are, would they be?
Speaker 2: White, Hispanic they were invited to the Boule, now they've had significant contributions that have been positive influences on the African American community.  And, and, and that member Boule or that group, local group decided that their impact was of such significance that they have invited then to be a part of the Boule.
Speaker 1: But it's overwhelmingly black?
Speaker 2: It's overwhelmingly black, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right and professionally I guess?
Speaker 2: Yes all professions, you have doctors, lawyers, accountants, you name it, engineers, ministers, things of that nature.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right now you can see why people would think it's an exclusive kind of a--
Speaker 2: I, I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) elitist group.
Speaker 2: It is an elite group, I will not question that it is an elite group, it is not an elitist group, but it is an elite group.  You have people who have made significant contributions to the African American community; they have been people who have always stood out.  Right now you have probably active only about five thousand members in the, in the country or in the world.  Because we do have organizations or groups in the Bahamas as well as in London [England], so it is made of up a group of, of very high, influential people around the world.
Story_ID: 671110
Speaker 1: Okay so be- because you can't join it and, and you're selected and you're not gonna be selected unless you're a professional and, and have made the significant contribution.  The rank and file, well they don't know much about it.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right so.
Speaker 2: Well, the Boule [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity] unlike other organizations, you, you're not going to see someone walking around with letters like you would have with Alpha [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity] or Kappa [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity], Omega [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity].
Speaker 1: Like a sweater or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Boule sweaters that, we that's just, that's not who we are.  Now contributions have been made by the members of the Boule, but you don't necessarily see it.  Because we say this is our building or we've made this kind of effect, we've given out scholarships, we've had, we've built buildings in Haiti, hospitals, all kinds of things.  But you don't necessarily see us putting our name on it. Civil rights, if you look at the Civil Rights Movement; members of the Boule have very active in that.  But not necessarily because the organization is touting this was done by the Boule.
Speaker 1: And what is the reason for that 'cause most black organizations want recognition, they want, they wanna say that I belong to the organization that sponsors the Third Street Little League.  Or I respon--or supported the local SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] or NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] or we gave this much money, and this is what I'm in.  You know people do that that's what they, how they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: And the recognition comes from doing something good and they hope that it'll inspire others to do something as well.  So why not the Bou- well why, why don't the Boule feel that way?
Speaker 2: You know it varies, there are some who feel that they like the fact that it is a (air quotes) secret society, we've heard that term used quite frequently.  That very similar to Skull and Bones organization at Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] that a lot is getting, that a lot of people are getting things done.  And you just don't know who's doing it, a lot of people like that.  Then there, there's a movement that says the Boule should become more public.  Because the more public it becomes, the more you incite people to do similar things.  And I think at this stage right now the Boule does have, we have a public policy po- committee.  We take public policy positions, it's just not, it's just not marketed in such a way that we're looking for attention.  My thing has always been certainly when I was the grand sire which is basically the national president of the organization, or the president of the organization.  My thing is if you do great things, you will be recognized, but you don't have to put your name on it, if you doing it, it will draw its own attention.  You know we gave out a hundred thousand dollars' worth of scholarships in Jefferson County [Texas] following Hurricane Rita.  We didn't have to call the local stations and say look at what the Boule is doing, the fact that we did it brought the stations to us.  "Who is this organization?"  Wha- wha--, "You gave out a hundred $1,000 scholarships?"  (Pause) If you're doing great things, it, the attention will come.
Story_ID: 671111
Speaker 1: Now is there a sensitivity about--and this could really could be a sensitive matter in 1904--I mean is there a sensitivity about being targeted for, for doing things for the black community?
Speaker 2: Oh absolutely you know you'd be amazed, because you know obviously because of my, my role in the Boule [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity], it's on my resume.  But most people probably don't have Boule on their resume, and you would never know that they are members of the organization.  I mean, I know because I have the membership directory and I know because I, I've gone around the country and over the world and I've met most, many of them.  But you know people kind of like being able to do without having a whole lot of wow, look at what they did.  We've had, even just locally, we've had students that have tried to go do some programs abroad, and they, they're out selling candy and car washes, y- that is not the Boule.  You're not gonna see the Boule doing a Link [The Links, Incorporated] sale, car wash sale, car wash, that's not gonna happen.  You're gonna have people sit around the table and they're gonna say look we believe this program is a very strong program, and we need to get behind it, support it.  And you know members will take out their checkbooks and they will make contributions to support that organization, and that organization goes.
Speaker 1: I was gonna ask you if, if members do individual giving through the Boule or do, does, do they contribute dues to the Boule and or how does that dynamic work (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Both.
Speaker 1: Both.
Speaker 2: You know I, I will 'cause you know I'm a member of Alpha [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity], I might give money to Alpha to help this organization.  I might just give the money directly to the organization just directly.  Or I might collectively come together as I told you earlier, men who are similar situated coming together to effectuate something for a greater cause that they night may not be able to do by an individual effort.  So I might get ten of the Boule members together and we might all say let's each give a hundred dollars and take that thousand dollars and provide a scholarship to this young man or this young, young lady.  I mean not that I can't give the hundred dollars, but collectively we might be able to do more together than we might be able to accomplish individually.
Story_ID: 671112
Speaker 1: When did you first hear about Boule [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity] and, 'cause you certainly didn't grow up in a household that knew anything (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: --about Boule?
Speaker 2: Clue-
Speaker 1: Just as I did.
Speaker 2: --clueless (laughter).
Speaker 1: I mean, yeah.  So, so where did you first hear, hear about it?
Speaker 2: When I was asked to speak at a function, that was my first anything about the Boule.
Speaker 1: And, and this would've been?
Speaker 2: In 2000.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In 2000.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then--
Speaker 1: Shortly after you joined the firm [Provost Umphrey Law Firm LLP]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I was invited to speak at a function and then I, you know, I tried to fi- when I do speak and I try to figure out who am I speaking to, what's my audience?  I did a little research, found out a little bit about the Boule, but if you try to do some research on the Boule you're really not gonna find a whole lot.
Speaker 1: Not, not positive 'cause there, there's a, there's been a some lit- literature afoot I guess since the '90s [1990s] I guess.  Condemning the Boule of some sort of black illuminati that some, somehow (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: You know, doing some nefarious work or something.
Speaker 2: A lot of information about the Boule is misinformation, because people don't understand who we are or what we do.  And I don't wanna call it misguided, but when you don't know and you speculate then--and you make assumptions you make very bad assumptions.  I can tell you the Boule has been an unbelievable experience, and I have watched firsthand the positive things that the Boule has done.  At least since I've been a member and even going back to history as I read the history book, other organizations would not been able to do it.  They don't have the infrastructure; they don't have the connections, the networking capabilities to get some of these things done.  I love Alpha I'm, I'm an Alpha I love A- Alpha Phi Alpha [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity] to, to my heart, but there are some things that Alpha Phi Alpha is limited in doing, because of certain limitations.  And so while I still am an active and life member of Alpha, I spend more time with the Boule because there are certain things that the Boule can do that Alpha just cannot.  Now on the other hand, there's some things that Alpha can do that the Boule can't do, they have numbers.  You know you've got fifteen, twenty thousand Alpha men that can put boots on the ground and start get, get out the vote effort and knocking on doors.  You're not gonna find Boule men when you only have five thousand in the country doing block walks for a get out the vote effort.  However, we might be able to take resources and put those resources with all the organizations that are doing that get out to vote effort.  And strengthen them and build them up where they may not be able to have those resources or the networking capabilities to make them stronger.  And so you don't have to do one or the other, certainly during my administration, my, my role was to take the Boule resources power, influences, ideas, philosophies and things of that nature.  Get with other similar situation organizations that are doing some of the programs that you're trying to do, enhance those programs where they may not have the ability, the resources.  Provide them re- resources that they might be able to go and do greater things.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay so, so you first encountered them in 2000 and when did you join the (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Two thousand and one [2001].
Speaker 1: Two thousand one [2001]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And later on I guess it's was, was this about around twenty- 2010 or so that you became the sire?
Speaker 2: Yes, I, I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Grand sire?
Speaker 2: I became the grand sire, I was the grand sire elect in 2010 through 2012, and then I was the grand, I was elected grand sire in 2012 and 2014.  The actual election was in 2010.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But you serve two years as the grand sire archon elect then two years as the grand sire, and two years as the immediate past grand sire.  So it's really a six year kind of commitment.  We started the election process, used to be, at one point it was a selected, and then it transferred.  And now you are, you are elected, and so I was the first, I was the youngest elected grand sire in the history of the organization.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's interesting; you spent two years in preparation, two years actually executing the job, and then two years of being a support to those who are coming (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Correct.
Speaker 1: --behind you.
Speaker 2: Correct it's to bring some continuity with, from one administration to another.  Certainly in my two years as the elect you're supporting the current grand sire, but you're also preparing.  Because two years it's really hard to get anything done in two years when you're trying to go nationally.  And so I spent my two years in preparation so that when I hit the ground, I hit the ground running.
Story_ID: 671113
Speaker 1: Were you able to accomplish most of the goals that you had when you were elected?
Speaker 2: Yes.  One of the, the, the--I, I wouldn't say all 'cause that--I am a big organizer and I'm a taskmaster so I, I came in with my first sixty days, first ninety days, first 120 days line item of what we wanted to get done.  And I was, after the first 120 days, I was about a month behind, but you know I wanted to make sure we went into the 21st century with technology.  Many of the members of the Boule are a little more senior than I was, and so you know but they all still communicate by text message, email.  And so I was really, really pushing to try to use technology.  I sent out, soon as I became grand sire [grand sire archon], I sent every, every member a text message from me, which had never been done.  But you know that's how we com- we were communicating at that time.  I sent emails out, I sent a lot of publications, I tried to be, I tried to be hands-on.  I was probably the first and (laughter) maybe the only one in the future that gave every member my cell phone number.  It was on my card I, I wanted their leader- I wanted them to have access to their leader.  I didn't want to be sitting in some office, and they feel like I can't reach out to my leader.  And so every archon which what we call our members, every archon had my cell phone number.  And not a, not a Boule cell phone, I have one cell phone, and every archon had my cell phone number.  So if you want to reach me at two o'clock in the morning you want to send me a text message, you can send it.  And, and many archons used it (laughter) pretty frequently.  So, but I wanted to have, I wanted to give, I wanted to have accessibility.  So one of my big push was for accessibility, technology and then I wanted to, to bring in another generation of archons.  The Boule at the time I came in was very, very senior and I wanted younger archons to get involved and not just be members, but be participants in the organization.  I wanted to change our communication style and all of those things were accomplished.  Some of the things that I did not get accomplished that I, wish we, you know I want to obviously get with more organizations, we were able to get that done.  But I did not in, in my opinion, provide the step stones, stepping stones that I would've liked for that generation.  I, I was able to bring in younger archons, but I wasn't, I didn't have enough time to get them groomed for leadership positions before I was out.  And so we ous- also have a foundation [Boule Foundation] which is set aside separate and apart from the Boul- Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity.  And I wanted to grow the foundation; I wanted the foundation to grow significantly.  We had a goal of $10 million when I came into the Boule, I thought that number was low, and I think and wanted it to be higher.  We were able to get that number raised we surpassed the goals that I had set when I became the grand sire, and we had significant contributions.  People ask how do you raise the, that kind of money, well we could raise it be going out soliciting support from, from companies.  I didn't wanna do that, I wanted to ask the members to make contributions, and within with- as soon as I took over, people laughed and joked.  But all you gotta do is ask.  When I took over as grand sire I raised probably a quarter of a million dollars in probably about five minutes, just 'cause I asked people.  Say hey, will you, will you join me, will join me, and I had people just willing to make contributions of significance.  Because they saw the benefits that we would be able to make in the future when not just the members before the community particular focus on young black males.
Speaker 1: And I guess the, the brain trust aspect of the Boule would assure people that a contribution would be used in effective way or something?
Speaker 2: Yes.  You know we, like again I say we have a foundation, which is separate and apart, and one of the purposes of that foundation is dealing with social issues.  Philanthropic ideas and concepts and trying to get behind those and support those to the best of our ability.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay so is the current leadership now you were elected you were, you were in your early forties I guess when you were elected?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the current leadership that young or?
Speaker 2: No they're a little more seasoned (laughter).  The average age of a grand sires for elected is probably late sixties, early seventies.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: So you know having a grand sire in the forties was not normal.
Story_ID: 671114
Speaker 1: Why do you think that, that the organization trusted you with that position at, at such a you- a relatively young age?
Speaker 2: I got involved very early I think, to be honest, President Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] was helpful, a lot of people referred to me as their Obama for the organization.  Because we followed President Obama and I followed similar tracks in that he received national attention when he did his speech at the Democratic campaign primary.  I had a similar speech in 2004 at our centennial it was call "A Hole in the Boat" [ph.], and I was the keynote speaker for the centennial address.  And that speech really promoted me on a national level where people our--I received a lot of national attention for that.  Pres- President Obama did his speech at the national Democratic camp- program, he received a not--a lot of national attention.  And then people just kept at that point--got me involved I, I stayed connected to some of the senior members.  Because I brought energy but I understood they had wisdom and so I wasn't trying to exclude the wisdom and get them out.  I wanted to take the wisdom and connect with the energy; because I thought with energy and wisdom we could really have something positive.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite project of the Boule [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity]?
Speaker 2: The Boule Foundation.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's, its hands down--it's, it's it is my, and always has been my strong emphasis.  Because I just think the Boule Foundation, there are no other organizations that have the resources that we get to dictate what we do to make our community stronger and better.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And the emphasis of the Boule Foundation has always, has historically been young black males.  So you, you see a greater emphasis put in mentoring, scholarships things of that nature as it affects young black males.
Story_ID: 671115
Speaker 1: Now in terms of your career, you're still relatively young, you're, you're a partner in a--a firm [Provost Umphrey Law Firm LLP] that's really a big player in this area [Beaumont, Texas].  What do you see as your future?
Speaker 2: I don't know me and ga- God and I are working on that, you know the natural progression would be politics, I don't see that personally.  Because my experience in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] was great but I, I, I like making sure things get done.  And I think sometimes when you get involved in politics you have to get so caught up in the red tape rhetoric.  And making sure that you get reelected that you really can't do what you wanna get done.  And I like--I'm not a talker, I like to get things done, and so sometimes I think the political arena limits people from doing what they really wanna get done.  So I, I can't sit here and tell you I know the answer to that. Obviously in the Boule [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity] I have done, I've reached the highest area in the Boule that I can reach.  And I don't plan to step down, I promised people when I was grand sire that I'm not you know retiring into the pasture.  I, I still want the Boule to grow; I still want the foundation [Boule Foundation] to grow.  I'm a--I have asked that the foundation reach a number of $40 to 50 million.  Because if we get to $40 to 50 million, and we're giving away 4 to $5 million in scholarships again we don't have to broadcast that.  When you're starting to make that kind of contribution affecting people of color from an organization within your own, it will say something for itself.  So I would like to grow the Boule to bigger and better, and I think we can do that. I'm gonna work very hard to get it done.

Speaker 1: Now you were recently ordained here, right? In the Baptist--okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I am a licensed minner- minister, I did, it was a little over five years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: With Cathedral of Faith Baptist Church [Beaumont, Texas], my focus is as director of the young adult ministry dealing with youth age eighteen to thirty-five.  I do a lot of speaking; I do what they call real talk which is really the take issues that are facing people today.  And try to make sure that they have somebody speak their language, and so we call it real talk.  You know I grew up in a time where everyone talked about Moses parting the Red Sea and biblically and that's great.  And I think there's some significance and you need obviously you need to know those biblical stories.  I try to make sure that people who understand when Moses parts the Red Sea how does that have an implication in your current life from a practical standpoint, what does that mean?  And so I try to take those, those parables, I try to take those, those books of the Bible and try to make them relevant.  So that people can say can- can see, how does that impact my life today?  Tomorrow just tomorrow I'll be teaching on partying like a rock star.  And I'll be dealing with David when he danced with all his might you know I'm trying, you know we've all, we've all heard the story of David dancing before the Lord with all his might.  Okay now I'm gonna take that and I'm going try to make that applicable to an eighteen, nineteen, twenty year old who's getting ready to go to a college fraternity party.  How does David dancing with all his might, how does that affect me at a college party?  And what's the relationship, the correlation between the two and that's, that's one of the gifts I believe God has given me.  Is to take that story and make it practical in today's life.
Story_ID: 671117
Speaker 1: We always ask this question, it's a good time for it.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Is that--well one my, my biggest concern is voting, I do, I am, I am really challenged with the fact that we do not vote in the manner in which I think we should.  I think we owe it to our ancestors, I think we owe it to ourselves.  And if we're really going to ever advance we have to get involved in the voting process.  I've been to the Bahamas and Jamaica when they vote, and they're so excited about the voting process.  And yet we will come here and will not vote, because it's raining outside or its cold outside, or I've gotta stand in a long line.  I, I think that's just it's insulting in my opinion to our ancestors.  And, and, and I'm doing everything I can to try to change the culture, the mindset behind our people on that.  So one of my greatest concerns is that we lose that urgency to vote.  I- and I'm like anyone else I'm human I get discouraged because you're sitting there you feel like you're beating people and they're not hearing you.  And at some point you just kind of wanna go back into your house and say you know I'm just tired of fighting it.  And then I had a conversation with Pastor Otis Moss [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Otis Moss, Jr.] probably about six months ago.  Very active in the Civil Rights Movement and he said, "Don't be discouraged James [HistoryMaker James E. Payne]," he says, "you know, when we did the Civil Rights Movement we didn't have everybody with us.  You gotta find those individuals who, who, who mean what they say, and are passionate about the cause."  He says, "If you can find those people who can do that, you can change this world."  And I, I look back on the civil rights in the '60s [1960s] and Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and Coretta Scott King and, and Ambassador Young [HistoryMaker Andrew Young] and all the other civil rights legends, they didn't have everyone on their side and matter of fact they didn't have even us on their side, and yet they still changed the world.  Mickey Leland told me, Congressman Leland told me, I saw him one day and he was, we were, we were in Washington, D.C.  And he has, he had a picture of him in a dashiki standing in front of the rotunda [U.S. Capitol, Washington, D.C.].  And, and, and I saw him and he was sitting in a three piece suit on, and I told him I said, "Congressman Leland what happened to you?"  I said, "You used to be down man you, you, you, you were dashikiing in the rotunda now you're in a three pouse- three piece suit."  He said, "James, I was in my dashiki and I was beating the table trying to deal with apartheid, and I got nothing done.  I put on a three piece suit, worked with other people and changed the world."  He said, "If you're all about making a statement put on your dashiki, beat the table, scream loudance- scream loud and clear.  You wanna change the world, you get with the people that can make the difference and you can change this world."  I never forget that and so I don't wanna be a part of an organization or a community that's just talking about problems, and not talking about solutions.  And so my concern is, is when we look at election system, electoral system and things of that nature, we have people in office that are not responsive to our needs or responsive to our community.  But we are putting them there; we're putting them there by voting them in, or not voting in the process.  And so my goal my, my, my challenge is to figure out a way to get us to be more engaged.  And my biggest concern is that we lose hope in the voting process.

Speaker 1: You had a successful life pre- by in large, but when you look back on your career is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could change something?
Speaker 2: Yes I di- there, there are a whole lot of things I would change.  But one of the things I, I, I think I would change the most is trying to bring other young people with me.  I think one of the problems we're having, I'm having and I think our generation is having, a lot of young people see where I am today and they think it's by osmosis.  It's just, it just happened, it didn't just happened, I fought, I mean I, I mean I fought hard.  I sacrificed, I, I gave a, a lot of my life to get to where I am, and they don't see that, they just see me today.  And they just think it just happened, it didn't just happen.  And so when I'm trying to tell them to make some sacrifices and, and commitments and, and, and struggles and feist they don't wanna, they don't wanna struggle.  They want, they wanna just get here it, you just get here (laughter) it takes work.  And, and, and if I had to do it all over again, I probably would've brought more people, younger people with me to see the struggle.  And not just see the end game.  Because I think when I try to get them back to talk about the struggle, they either don't believe me or they think I'm exaggerating.
Story_ID: 671119
Speaker 1: You mentioned your family before but you, you want to tell, tell us more about your children and what they're doing?
Speaker 2: Yes, I have a son Caleb, James Caleb Payne II [James C. Payne II], he's named after my father [James C. Payne].  He is now a sophomore at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia]; he's studying economics and Mandarin which is kind of weird, but (laughter) that's where he decided to go.  And I have a senior now, Joshua [Joshua Payne] who is now trying to decide where he's going to attend; he's looking at both majority and HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities].  And then a daughter Taryn [Taryn Payne], they have a little different, obviously Caleb and Joshua named after my, Caleb's named after my father.  But the Caleb and Joshua reference from biblical perspective. Then my daughter Taryn.  They all have their little unique character, focus really hard on education.  My boys are very athletic, but they have all done very, performed very well ac- academically.  And so you know I'm really big on family.  Although I have travelled with the Boule [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity] which is a--really a full time job, I only missed one of each of their games.  Because when their games they, they play basketball and baseball, and my daughter ba- basketball and volleyball.  When they get their scheduling the first thing I do is hand the schedule to my secretary, she puts it on my calendar, and I schedule everything around it.  The reason why I do that is because I think one of the things that happens quite frankly with men of color who've been successful is that we get success and it takes us away from the family.  And when it takes us away from the family we lose that family structure, that family unit.  And I didn't wanna be a part of that, so I wanna make sure I'm there as much as I can.  Because I know when they're gone, they're gone and those formidable years, once they're gone they, they've been made available, it's, it's over.  And so I, I, I try to make sure I'm there for everything that I can.  My wife [Tracie Wilson Payne] is, she's a te- like I said she's graduated from TSU [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas], she has her M, M.B.A. from Lamar University [Beaumont, Texas].  She's--stay at home mom but she's been very active in a lot of community things, and it was kind of the same thing.  We made a de- a decision early on when she had children that I wanted my children to be raised by the parents.  And so I wanna be engaged, I don't want my teacher to only know the wife, the mother, I want her to--the teachers to know the father as well.  So every time my children went to a new classroom, I made sure the teacher had my wife's telephone number and my telephone number and my email.  Because I want them to know that my children's father's- father is engaged.  I go to all of their games, I don't criticize the coach, even though I, I know basketball.  I am there to support my children because I want my children to know that they are student athletes, and not athletic students.  Because the school will try to make my children athletic students, because they of their familiarity with me, oh I'm sure they're gonna be a great basketball player.  No they're a great student, they happen to play basketball, but they are a great student, and I want everybody to remember that.
Speaker 1: So do all of them play basketball?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, well that's interesting.
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) All right.
Speaker 2: So it's, my daughter's had a little more challenges with it than (laughter) my two sons but my, all of them have been, especially my sons have been very, very athletic, gifted.  So, very happy but, you know, while I'm very proud that they're very athletically gifted, they're also straight A students.  So, you know, that's gonna carry them a lot further than some basketball or baseball.
Story_ID: 671120
Speaker 1: Is there anything I have not asked you about or you need to mention before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Well one of the things you asked me--what was my motto, and my motto really is I play to win.  And that's--that started happening when my brother [Jason Payne] was in the fourth grade.  He brought, bought me this thing from kaledis- Kaleidoscope [Beaumont, Texas] which is an organiz- like a carnival.  And it had a picture of a, a guy a, a white kid with a old baseball bat, a hat and a glove and a ball.  And at the bottom it said, "I play to win." I, I look at that and I, I hung it on my--the back of my door in college [University of Houston, Houston, Texas] and law school [University of Houston Law Center, Houston, Texas].  I still have it today because I have never allowed my income to dictate my outcome.  And so I wasn't raised with a lot of money, but I was raised with knowledge that I could do better.  Both mentally and physically and career wise and I want everyone to understand that I try to, I speak to everyone as much as I can.  That no matter what your background or your resources, you can achieve and I, I you know my children fortunately were not raised in the economic situation that I was raised in.  But I have to buffer that because sometimes you can raise them so well that they almost forget the struggle.  And so I'm trying to guide them, give them enough struggle but not too much struggle, so that they're not, they're not negatively impacted.  But I don't want them to become spoiled brats where they forget where they really come--where they've come from.  And so that I play to win really is what makes me who I am, because God has been truly good to me and it's allowed me to do great things.  And he has put people around me that have allowed me to grow in the right way.
Story_ID: 671121
Speaker 1: It's like a combination of questions, two questions really, we, we close out with and they're similar but different.  Sir what today would consider to be your legacy and how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: My legacy I think is going to be my passion for young adults I, I truly have a, a passion that we take our generation that--what, I think we're losing.  And try to motivate them to be the very best in excellence.  We don't want them to--mediocracy is, is, is just is something that I detest.  I, you, you've got to strive for excellence, and so I have a passion to motivate young people to be the very best that they can be.  What I hope that I will leave, and I think I will leave, is that James [HistoryMaker James E. Payne] was all- has always been very energetic to making a difference in provem- problem solving.  I am not big into giving speeches or talks on issues without solutions, matter of fact I will decline to do interviews or panel discussions unless they're gonna talk about solution base results.  CNN came down here ten years ago and asked me to serve on the panel 'Is Racism Still Existing in America?' [ph.].  I'm not gonna serve on that panel, that's a stupid question.  Now if you wanna tell, if you wanna ask me to serve on a panel 'How Are We Going to Deal with the Racism in America,' that I will serve on.  You're not going to have me involved in any discussions that just accents and highlights the obvious problems.  Unless we're going to talk about how we're going to resolve them.  And I say the same thing with young adults; we know that they're apathetic when it comes to voter participation, voter involvement.  And to some extent even voter education, let, let's not condemn them so much about it; let's talk about how to re, resolve it.  And I hope to be remembered as a sa- problem solving individual that tried to make a difference for the young people of America.
Speaker 1: Okay, well thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you very much, appreciate it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) All right.

Speaker 2: Okay, this is a picture of my wife and I celebrating the, our tenth anniversary. We were trying to enjoy Aruba.  Which is where this picture is taken off the balcony of, of Aruba.
Speaker 1: About what year is that?
Speaker 2: It's in 2005.
Speaker 1: And your wife's name?
Speaker 2: My knife- wife's name's Tracie [Tracie Wilson Payne].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my, my brother Jason [Jason Payne], I had the pleasure of draping him with his doctorate degree from University of Houston Law Center [Houston, Texas].  Too, not too often two brothers get to graduate from the same law school, and so that was me giving him his drape.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of my kids going to, on our first cruise to the Bahamas, as you can see they're holding hand in hand.  I've always made a big pisure- picture--a, a issue about the fact that we have to protect one another, and the big brothers [James C. Payne II and Joshua Payne] always have to protect their sister [Taryn Payne], so there they are.
Speaker 2: Every year we take a family vacation and this is a family vacation at Lake Tahoe, this is the one event because of the athlets- the, the one event that we can do together which is skiing.  And we do this for Christmas holidays; we go skiing and ski down the mountain on Christmas day.
Speaker 1: This was the completion, this was the completion of our family, my kids, this is when my daughter was born.  And as you can see we're all covering her, which is pretty much how she acts now, we all have to cover her.  But watching her grow, that's what we've done.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Picture of my wife and I, my wife Tracie and I for our wedding on July 22, 1995, it's at the University of Houston chapel [A.D. Bruce Religion Center, Houston, Texas].  Which is where I was attending at the time we met.
Speaker 2: And this is a picture of myself as well as Ambassador Young [HistoryMaker Andrew Young] and the governors from the Bahamas; they're all members of the Boule [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity].  And we were there trying to get some understanding of the interactions and effects of young African American men.
Speaker 1: My wife Tracie and I were invited to inauguration of President Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] which was indeed an honor.  I was there participating in that in 2013.
Speaker 2: My favorite picture is, which is my son, Joshua Payne, and his friend Jackson Meadows [ph.], which I didn't have white friends growing up.  And this is one of my son's best friends, what I like is that they're relying on each other to help each other become better.  And it yet demonstrates that through their cross country.
Speaker 1: This is a picture where the people always brag about my athletic ability; but here I'm being recognized in Austin [Texas] just recently for my efforts both in at, athletics as well as my profession in the practice of law.  Standing next to me is my coach, my high school [Abraham Lincoln High School; Memorial High School, Port Arthur, Texas] coach James Gamble who is the hall of fame coach [Texas High School Basketball Hall of Fame].  And to his right is another grand sire, the grand sire elect Gregory Vincent [Gregory J. Vincent], who is the vice president of diversity at University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas].
Speaker 2: Of course it was, one of my greatest honors was to meet President Obama and spend time with him.  He, he is without a doubt the coolest president we will have serve on the White- in the White House.  That was a picture that I took of him as, as he became our forty-fourth president.
Speaker 1: And before he was the president, he was a senator and I was supportive of him, and that's a picture of he and I and my wife.  As you can tell when you're president it takes a little toll on you, your physical appearance (laughter).
Speaker 2: One of my jobs when I was grand sire was to visit other communities where we were supporting.  And this is a picture of me and grand sire elect as we were building houses in Haiti.  Haiti had a, a devastating destruction following an earthquake, if you can see behind the grand sire in the black shirt is a building that we had built to house very Haitians.  And that's me shaking, sifting through some of the rocks so that we could provide workplace for them to, to live.
Speaker 1: Is that like twenty- 2012 or?
Speaker 2: That was in 2012, yes.  The Haitians also because of the, the demographics there and the, the situation that was going on, they have loff- lot of loss of limbs.  And they actually are able to produce limbs with prosthesis and that is the Haitian hospital of, of the prosthetics that they're asking me to look at.
Speaker 1: And this is a photo from a folk a, a picture from a speech that I gave 'There's a Hole in the Boat' [ph.].  Which was done in 2004 at the centennial celebration of the Sigma Pi Phi [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity], which was the photo that the speech, that really kind of motivated me to get to the next level.
Speaker 2: One of the things I try to do with the Boule was to coordinate cor- collaborate with other organizations.  One of the other organizations that I was collaborating with was The Links [The Links, Incorporated] organization.  The picture to that you're seeing now is a picture of me and the president, and the past president [HistoryMaker Margot Copeland] and the current president [Glenda Newell-Harris] with the Boule and The Links doing organizations together.
Speaker 1: This is the picture that describes what started me in practicing law, it's following the explosion of the TV that we talked about earlier.  As you can see there are toys out front and this is really what changed my, my career path.
Speaker 2: And that is the picture of the injury that I sustained following that explosion, as you can see I had a complete picture tube go through my hand.  And that's following the surgery.
Speaker 1: Everyone needs a hobby, one of the hobbies I have is riding motorcycles.  This is a picture of my Harley Ultra got- Ultra Glide [Harley-Davidson Ultra Glide] that I love riding, just something I do for me and my family.
Speaker 2: And this is a picture of my entire, my family and all of my siblings and our, our wives and, and our children.  Following a christening of my nieces on my ma--it is an opportunity to see that all of our family we've all married.  And, and all of us are married to people who are educated and that it's (unclear) opportunity.
Speaker 1: My brother is M.B.A and J.D. and this is his graduation picture from Kellogg University [Kellogg School of Management, Evanston, Illinois].  We were there to be supportive, we are, as you can see, anytime we have educational opportunities we're there as a family to support each other.
Speaker 2: This is the house that I grew up in at 1919 Stillwell [Stillwell Boulevard, Port Arthur, Texas].  It was five of us in this house.  The house was 575 hundred square feet, my daughter's playhouse is only twenty-five- is 550 square feet.  And I always keep that picture as a reminder where I came from.
Speaker 1: This is following my calling to accept my calling to preach the word of God; this is from my first speech at where I was preaching on the sermon, 'There's Something That Needs to be Changed' [ph.].
Speaker 2: And this is a picture again of my family; this was taken for purpose of the Boule.  As you can see I have a medallion in the middle which is the John Clemmons level Legacy [John B. Clemmons, Sr. Legacy Award] giving, the Boule has just recently established a legacy in my honor now.  And it will became, be called the James Payne Legacy [James E. Payne Legacy Award].
Speaker 1: I'm a member of Alpha Phi Alpha and this is the really indoctrination when they opened up the MLK Monument [Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial] in Washington, D.C.  And I was proud to be a part of that with Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc.].
Speaker 2: Now this is another photo of me with two of the grand presidents, general presidents of Alpha Phi Alpha, James Williams [James R. Williams] on the left and Charles Teamer [HistoryMaker Charles Teamer, Sr.] on the right.  Who--Charles Teamer a very big part of me being grand sire because he's also a former grand sire as well of Sigma Pi Phi Boule.
