Story_ID: 253566
Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, there are five People magazine-ish type questions I am compelled to ask and they only require a short answer.  The first one is, sir, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: That's an interesting question, probably I would say collard greens and turkey.
Speaker 1: Okay, now do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Not really, blue and black.
Speaker 1: Okay, a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Summertime, warm weather.  I like warm weather.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Yes I do, Africa in general.  I like visiting Africa, their beautiful vacation sites there.  The beaches, the beaches on the West Coast, East Coast and South Coast and beautiful mountains such as Mount Kilimanjaro [Tanzania] and, of course, the game reserve and the beautiful forest in Congo [Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)] and Rwanda, Burundi, for example.
Speaker 1: Okay, and last question, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's a saying by Robert [F.] Kennedy [sic. George Bernard Shaw], I don't know if he originated the saying, but I remember his brother, Edward [M.] Kennedy, made the statement at his funeral and it was, it went something like this, some men dream of things and say why not, or say, why--rather, some men think, see things and say why, some men dream of things and say, why not ["Some men see things as they are and say why? I dream things that never were and say why not?"], and I like that phrase and the reason I like it is because it's important to think outside of the box, so to speak, that is to think beyond and act beyond the given and what's given or what's an extension of the given oftentimes seem what's most possible but what's most possible, most often, especially when people are suffering, is not enough and so it's important to say, why not make a difference in people's lives and in order to do that oftentimes one has to think outside the box, outside of tradition, outside what's given.
Story_ID: 253567
Speaker 1: Now I'm going to ask you about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side.  We'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes, my mother's maiden name is Annie, A-N-N-I-E, she prefers Ann, A-N-N, but it was given as Annie, A-N-N-I-E, Mae, middle name, middle initial, "M," M-A-E, Bennett, "B" as in boy, E-N-N-E-T-T.
Speaker 1: Okay, so her maiden name was Bennett?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My mother's date of birth is August 14, 1932.
Speaker 1: Okay, and where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Columbus, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now her name is just, maiden name is the same as my name because I was born when my mother was fourteen years old and she was not married to my father.  I've never known my father.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you don't know who he is at all or--
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --no idea of his name, his family, no family history at all.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them or what stories are told of that side?
Speaker 2: Well I know, personally, from my great-grandmother, whom I knew very well, growing up in Columbus, Georgia, our family is originally from Alabama, that is, we were living in Alabama before moving to Georgia and that was in the late 1800s that we left Alabama and moved to Georgia, or early 1900s, and they were farmers in Georgia.  They actually owned their own land, at one point, quite a number of acres of land.  They owned land, three hundred and some acres of land that they had acquired, this is on my mother's side, my great-grandmother's side of the family, land which was eventually taken from them by the United States government for the expansion of the [U.S.] military base there, the Fort Benning, Georgia military base.  At least that's the family story.  I don't know detail beyond what the family said.  So--
Speaker 1: So they say that the government took the land, not purchased the land, is that what you're saying?
Speaker 2: Chances are, it probably was through some legal proceeding, condemnation proceedings of sorts, I don't know, but, of course, my people were, at that time, were not that well versed in the ways of sophisticated legal proceedings and, of course, at that time, could not obtain such proceeding, representation in such proceedings in Columbus, Georgia so it certainly would not have been a fair exchange for land, there's no question about that.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's, now Fort Benning is, ironic that so many black soldiers have gone through Fort Benning, Georgia--
Speaker 2: Yes, exactly, yes.
Speaker 1: So many people we've interviewed were trained at Fort Benning.
Speaker 2: Right, it's the largest, I think it still is, the largest United States military infantry training base in the world.
Story_ID: 253568
Speaker 1: Family lived close to Fort Benning [Georgia], I guess?
Speaker 2: Fort Benning was a major part of our lives.  My uncles, two of my uncles were in the [U.S.] military, United States Army, and they did their basic training at Fort Benning.  Family members worked at Fort Benning.  Soldiers who were on leave visited the little town, Columbus, Georgia, that's what gave the town some window, if you will, to the outside world because we had all these African American men who were from various parts of the United States coming to that place for training, that is Fort Benning military post for training and, of course, when they were on leave, they visited Columbus, Georgia, they visited the town and so it was very much a part of our lives, our discussion and I always heard about Fort Benning, and I visited Fort Benning quite often.  A very impressive place, of course.  Very clean, very neat, very orderly, soldiers are very disciplined.  It was always a very impressive place to visit.
Story_ID: 253569
Speaker 1: About your ancestors on your mother's [Annie Bennett] side, now, are there any other stories about, about them?
Speaker 2: Yeah, quite a number of stories.  As I said earlier, we moved from Alabama to Georgia and at some point we moved into town.  I don't know if that was after the land was taken by the U.S. government for the military base [Fort Benning, Georgia], but at some point we moved to the town, and so my life was always, that is growing up, I grew up in a town itself.  I never lived on a farm and did not know the farm life.  I always knew the urban life but relatively small town, urban life.  Columbus, Georgia was the second largest city in Georgia at the time, that is outside of Atlanta [Georgia], Atlanta being the largest, and, but even living in that town, I learned how to tend a garden, that is raise vegetables.  My great-grandmother saw to that, my grandmother saw to that, my mother saw to that and learned to tend flower, create and tend the flower bed, as we used to call it.  And so, in the city life, we all lived, the entire family, lived very close together.  My great-grandmother lived probably, maybe, ten minutes, fifteen minutes away from my grandmother and actually lived with my grandmother.  My mother lived in the home with my grandmother, so did I, so it was a very close-knit family.  Physically, we were always in close proximity to each other except for those who went to Chicago [Illinois].  There were, I'm the third generation in my family to have moved here from, outside of moving north, or outside of Georgia, to, to Chicago.  There were relatives of mine who came here in the 1920s, after the First World War [World War I, WWI], to escape the oppression in the South and there were relatives of mine who came during and after the Second World War [World War II, WWII], for the same reasons and job opportunities here in the factories, et cetera.  And then there were relatives who came during the time when I came in the, I came in the early 1960s, my mother brought me here.  So, the stories that I know from my family in growing up in the South is of relatives coming back from the North, telling us about this wonderful place here where they had good paying jobs and usually somebody would come back, whoever came back would always have a new car, very shiny car and new clothes and, of course, they always talked different.  They were--always talked proper, so to speak, and that was always an impressive appearance for those of us who lived in the South because here were these people coming, relatives coming back from some place outside of the South who were quite successful and so all of us wanted to go north.
Story_ID: 253570
Speaker 1: I want to go back to, to your mother [Annie Bennett], though, and, can you tell us like, did she talk about growing up in the South?
Speaker 2: Yes she did.  Yes she did.
Speaker 1: Did she, well did she have any stories she'd share with you about growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was extremely difficult, extremely difficult, and my mother talks about it even to this day how extremely difficult it was and how as, be honest, how mean white people were.  My grandfather used to talk about it as well, how mean white people were and I can remember talking around Christmastime or a lot of time in the winter we'd sit around the fireplace and, or the heater, wood burning stove or something like that, and my grandfather would talk about, we would, he would tell jokes and a lot of the jokes were jokes that involved the relationship between whites and blacks and it was always a story of white people being mean to black people.
Speaker 1: Can you remember any of them, any one of them that you could tell us?
Speaker 2: Yes, I don't really want to say--
Speaker 1: It'd be a valuable, it'd be valuable to have.  I mean, I mean--
Speaker 2: --say them on camera, but--
Speaker 1: If they don't come from, from us, who are they going to come from, you know?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Well I remember one story and we used to laugh, I didn't know any better at the time.  I can remember my grandfather saying to the family because we used to all, just was a family activity, sit around the stove or fireplace in the wintertime, and the one story was this man named, John [ph.], this black man named John, and he worked for whites and he worked on a farm for whites and he was shucking corn and the white man wasn't paying him any money, just a tiny bit of money, barely enough to make it, and so John complained all the time to other blacks, his fellow workers.  So, and they were all afraid to go ask for a raise and they needed a raise, they needed more money for their work and so finally one of the group pushed John to go and demand a raise from the white man and John finally got up his nerves to go and, and demand or ask this white man for more money.  So John says, "Well look, boss, I'm not making enough money and I gotta have some more money and you just gotta pay me more money" and my grandfather talked in the dialect and we would laugh at the way John was talking to the white man, et cetera and my father, grandfather acted out both roles.  And so the white man said to John, "Well, John, what are you going to do with, if I don't pay you any more money?" and the black man said, "Well, boss, I'm just going to shuck some more corn for you."  And that was a very telling story because it was a story that talked about a lack of courage on the part of the black men as well as the meanness of the whites and the fear that black men had of whites and how we were stuck in this very, very oppressive situation, had no alternatives and couldn't see any alternatives.  And there were jokes like that told all the time and we would laugh and we would in part laugh because we knew that there was really an alternative and I always felt that there was as well.
Story_ID: 253571
Speaker 1: And I remember very well how we lived and my folks talked about how they used to live on the farms, how they had to walk miles to go to the one little school and my mother [Annie Bennett] went to school but she didn't finish the school.  She later got her, what a, GED [General Educational Development], I think it's called, as an adult, and eventually became a registered nurse, but at any rate, she talked about having to walk miles to school.  She talked about the church life my grandmother, my great-grandmother talked about church life and I remember it very well because I used to go to church with both of them.
Speaker 2: What church did you all attend?
Speaker 1: We used to go to Antioch Baptist Church [Columbus, Georgia].  Reverend Mitchell was the pastor and I remember sitting in the pews with my great-grandmother and my mother.  I remember the songs they used to sing and they just talked about their lives and where they lived in the South, and, but it was always, and their discussions, there was always a white, black element.  It was, I would imagine with whites, when a lot of the discussion don't involve us but with us, growing up in the South, our discussions about our lives always had some white component in it and it was not a favorable one towards them.
Story_ID: 253572
Speaker 1: Who was in your household when you grew up?  Did you have any brothers and sisters and--
Speaker 2: When I was growing up, I did not have any brothers and sisters.  I later had brothers and sisters when I was ten years old.  My mother [Annie Bennett] married and then I had two brothers and a sister.
Speaker 1: But you didn't really grow up with them?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't grow, did not grow up with them, and I continued to, I always lived with my grandmother and my mother lived there as well until she got married, then she moved out.  And in my household, my aunts, who were my sisters, because some of them were the same age as me, or close, I have an aunt who's younger than me, and there are several of them who are two or three, just two or three years older than me, so they were like sisters, and then cousins.  My aunt's children, they also lived in the house and they were my brother, I had a brother, a cousin, first cousin, who was like a brother and a couple of aunts who were real sisters.  So, it was an interesting household.  It was certainly an extended family household.
Story_ID: 253573
Speaker 1: Do you have a first childhood memory?  Can you remember the first thing that you ever, you know, first time you were really aware of--
Speaker 2: Yeah I can, I think the very first time, there are two of them, one, traumatic events in a sense.  I remember when we lived in Columbus, Georgia, my [maternal] grandfather got into some type of an argument or a fight with a man, black man.  I must have been about three years old or four years old I think at the time, my mother [Annie Bennett] says, and I remember this man trying to run my grandfather over in a pickup truck.  I remember that very vividly.  We lived in an area near the railroad tracks, dusty ground and I remember this truck, my grandfather jumping out of the way at the last minute and the dust obscuring the scene somewhat but my grandfather just, the dust from the truck, as the driver tried to hit my grandfather.  I remember that and then also I remember when I was about four, five, I was making, part of my job as a child was to make the fire during the winter, that is to light the fire in the stove, that is to go get the wood or fetch the wood as folks called it and put it in the stove, light the stove, and I was very young and I once, when I first started doing it, I didn't quite know how to do it and I remember I put the kerosene, I think is what we used or some type of lighter fluid on the wood, and I had my hand in the stove and as the wood caught fire, my hand caught fire as well and I burned my hand and the scar mark is on my hand.  So I remember that very well and I was only four or so.
Story_ID: 253574
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up [in Columbus, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Of when I was growing up?  I, well of course I remember the new school smell.  The new, that is the new school year days, the new school year smell.  I remember that very well.
Speaker 1: Now, what's the new school year smell?  What--
Speaker 2: New blue jeans, new shoes, new clothes, the new clothes smell, the books, not always new books, but still some new books, but the few new things we had we had them for the beginning of school and I remember that smell very distinctly and clean hallways, so I remember that very well and also I remember the smells in our home.  Our home was very neat, very orderly, very clean.  The yards were always clean.  We had, there were, I don't recall any grass being in the yards and the streets weren't paved.  Streets were paved in the whites' neighborhood but when the, and we lived very close to the whites, we used to play with the whites, kids, but in the white neighborhoods, the street would be paved but as soon as the street got to our section of the town, they were unpaved, then they would start again as being paved once the street, same street, the same road, reached the white neighborhood, and--
Speaker 1: It seemed to be a common feature of the black part of southern towns.
Speaker 2: Yeah, very, very much so, very interesting feature, very cruel feature as well, but nonetheless, I remember the smells in our home being very, very neat and in spite of all this dust from the road, of course we'd water our dusty area and the street would always be watered because we watered ourselves to keep the dust out.
Speaker 1: Did you all have like a, those swept yards?  Did they sweep the yards?
Speaker 2: With a switch broom.  That's what they called switch broom but I think they were but they were made of straw, or whatever, so we always, I don't know if my folks made, well somebody black made them in the neighborhood in the farm areas nearby or something like that and we always had that.  I used to do the sweeping as well.  So we're always cleaning and I remember cleaning the house and they were always very demanding on the part of my mother [Annie Bennett], my grandmother, that the house be clean.  And I remember the smells in the house and how clean and neat it was and I liked that and I remember my grandmother's home, it was also, my great-grandmother's home, very neat, very clean and I remember, I used to clean her chicken coop and take care of the chickens and she used to pay me, I forgot, maybe a nickel a week or something like that.  I used to do that at least once a week and, of course, I remember the smell.  Anyway, I don't know if that's what you're looking for necessarily--
Speaker 1: Yeah, those are.
Speaker 2: --but those are the smells I remember.
Story_ID: 253575
Speaker 1: How would you describe yourself as a little kid?  How do you think, what were you like and what were you interested in?
Speaker 2: I think I was very industrious as a child.  I can remember having a job from a very early age.  There was a white man who owned a store, a grocery store, that served both, a small store, that served both the poor whites and the poor blacks in our neighborhood and his name was Mr. Sewer [ph.], and I used to work for Mr. Sewer, and I couldn't have been more than maybe six years old when I first started that and what I would do is clean up the store and I think I got a, oh I don't remember, it was either a quarter, a quarter a week.  I used to go there on Saturdays and I used to go there after school, I think, and he would give me, I think, a quarter a week, plus all the watermelon, not watermelon but the bologna rinds.  So I'd take those home--that is the end of the bologna roll, the very end of it that couldn't be sold.  Well, I would collect all of those, take 'em home--that was my pay plus the twenty-five cents.
Speaker 1: So the rind of the round end, at the end of the roll?
Speaker 2: Right, the very end of the roll.  It wasn't sold, but there's always a little meat, so, I'd have that for every day to take home.  I did that.  I also, as a very young child, worked on a, I worked for my [maternal] great-grandmother, she paid me for cleaning the chicken coop.  I also worked on a peach truck, selling peaches during the summer.  So I did that kind of activity so in essence I was industrious.  I was a very good student in school.  My mother [Annie Bennett] and my family were very conscientious about that and I remember I was too.
Speaker 1: Now what was, what was the name of your school?
Speaker 2: Claflin, C-L-A-F, C-L-A-F-L-I-N, Claflin Elementary School [Claflin School, Columbus, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay, now this is, describe, now this school was all-black school, I guess?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, of course, all black, very small.
Speaker 1: Was it, was it public school or a support?
Speaker 2: It was a public school, yes.  It was one of, I don't remember how many elementary schools there were for the African Americans in Columbus, Georgia, but it was one of the few that were there.  And it was a good walk from my home--
Speaker 1: Now would you say--
Speaker 2: --and a couple of, several miles, a couple of miles maybe.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we used to walk past the white school to get to our school.
Story_ID: 253576
Speaker 1: How was Columbus [Georgia] deployed in terms of the black population?  Was there like a black side of town or were you just kind of scattered all over Columbus or--
Speaker 2: No, there were, there were certainly several distinctly black neighborhoods.  There was one called, well people used to live in the flats and the flats, I still have no idea quite, excuse me, to this day what that really means but this was the area near the Chattahoochee River which ran, which bordered the town, and so there are blacks who lived in that area and that was just all black but where I lived, it was in, closer to the center of town, a little way from downtown, but still in the central urban area and the white people, poor whites lived right nearby us so it was really mixed, right across the railroad tracks, the white people lived, and to get to the store, the little grocery store in the neighborhood, we just walked across the railroad tracks and we played on the railroad embankments, the white children and black children.  We had a little, we made ourselves a little ball field and we all played together until we got a certain age, then we didn't play together anymore, but very early we played, early on, six, seven, eight years old.  Yeah, we did play together, five, four, whatever.  So it was mixed and we were friendly to white people, the kids, they were friendly to us and there was always very respectful relationships between the whites and us, as long as we stayed in our place, then the relationship was a very cordial one, respectful one.  Everybody knew exactly what their place was and the children learned it as we went along.
Speaker 1: Okay, did, did little white kids have the same kind of, was there an age respect thing paid to, I mean as well as a race one, I mean?
Speaker 2: Was there age, what now?
Speaker 1: I mean, in terms of white children, did they pay the same kind of respect to white adults as black children had to, or was there a difference?
Speaker 2: No, I think we all did.  It was a time when we were very respect--children were very respectful.  It was the same culture, basically.  We were all taught the same basic Christian culture and as a child I used to go to church every Sunday, Baptist church, with my family because we were all churchgoing people.  That's another very distinctive part, memory, of my childhood, going to this Antioch Baptist Church [Columbus, Georgia], but we as children were very respectful towards our black elders and also towards white elders, as well.
Story_ID: 253577
Speaker 1: We were talking about school [Claflin School, Columbus, Georgia] and church [Antioch Baptist Church, Columbus, Georgia] and the culture in Columbus, Georgia.  Now, when you went to school, did you, was there any black history taught in school?
Speaker 2: Black history?  I don't recall anything like that.  I really don't.  No, not at all.
Speaker 1: Do you remember when you first heard about Africa or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I remember (laughter), we watched television when it was first introduced in the South in the 1950s.  We had a, I think we had a television.  My [maternal] grandfather got a, somehow purchased a television and people used to come to our house and watch it and it was black and white and, because you used to watch baseball.  I remember that on TV, very early, and then also there was a program, what would you call it, it was not a program but, well program or some type of series that came on television on, it was called 'Ramar of the Jungle' or something like that and it was a program that had all the stereotypes about Africa and, of course, I believed them.  I didn't have anything to counter it and it was about these white explorers, as I recall, they were in Africa and, of course, the Africans were not only stupid and ignorant but scared of everything and the white man was, of course, fearless and most intelligent and creative in every way and the Africans were subordinate in every way to the whites, and I remember that very well.  That was my first image of Africa really as far as I can recall and in addition to that, I remember early on in the 1960s--1960, when the TV news reports of the [Congo] Crisis in the [Republic of the] Congo [Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)] came along and I remember watching it on television, the news reports and it was, the reports were very negative about blacks and so generally my impression of Africa from a very early age was a very negative one.
Speaker 1: But, you know, that coverage, when I reflect back on it, we're about the same age, but that coverage as a kid, those names just resonated, [Joseph] Kasa-Vubu or [Patrice] Lumumba--
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: --[Moise] Thsombe.
Speaker 2: Thsombe, very much so.
Speaker 1: [State of] Katanga, all those names just kind of stick back there.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they sure do.
Speaker 1: They, it was, the coverage, I'm sure, was not ideal.  I don't remember the context of a lot of it now but I know that there was a crisis there and the names just seemed, I mean they just, you'd hear them over and over again, these African names--
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 253578
Speaker 1: It was a very critical time for Africa really.  [Patrice] Lumumba, of course, in many ways was a Malcolm X of Africa at that time.  He was a truly, a very important, a nationalist leader of Africa.  In fact at one point, he and [Kwame] Nkrumah of Ghana talked about establishing a united state, that is a Ghana/[Republic of the] Congo [Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)] as a united state even though they were miles apart.  So they both believed in the unity of Africa and at that time, Lumumba was way ahead of his time and the, he had tremendous opposition as you can well imagine because most of the black leadership that the few who were in leadership in the Congo at the time in 1960, they were obviously allied with the Belgians.  The Belgians, though they had granted the Congo independence, certainly wanted to maintain, and intended to maintain control of the Congo because of its wealth, its resources, but Lumumba wanted a clean break.  He wanted Congo to be truly independent and the resources to be used for the upliftment of the Congolese people and so that was really the heart of the [Congo] Crisis.  He was going in one direction, the leadership, most of the people were going in the way that the Belgians wanted, leaders were going in a way that the Belgians wanted to go and so he was really isolated and he was killed as a result of that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, now, you, you were about twelve when that was going on, I guess?
Speaker 1: Yes, I was twelve years old.
Speaker 2: Twelve, yes.  Did you have a sense or did anybody else have a sense in your community where you were growing up and what was going on?  I mean--
Speaker 1: No idea whatsoever.  It was about as foreign to us except the people were blacks as what may have been happening in Russia [Soviet Union] some place.  We could identify with the people because they were black people looking like us but had absolutely no idea what was really happening.
Speaker 2: And likewise, when you, when you watched, and I'm sure when you got this television, you could probably see scenes from the Civil Rights Movement on CBS News and that sort of thing.  I mean, I don't know, could you, 'cause I've heard some people say that some things were censored from the news actually down in the South.
Speaker 1: I don't remember anything from the Civil Rights Movement in Columbus, Georgia as a child, absolutely nothing.  I don't remember seeing anything on television.  Of course, I remember as a teenager, when I was living here in Chicago [Illinois], because I moved, and also in Cincinnati, Ohio, I left Columbus, Georgia when I was ten, moving to Cincinnati, Ohio, but, when up to the age of ten, I honestly don't remember any, seeing anything on television, hearing anything on the radio.  We had a radio as well.  Nothing about any kind of Civil Rights Movement at all, anywhere.
Story_ID: 253579
Speaker 1: Do you suspect there was a censor in the South because some have told us that they thought it was censored down South, you know (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I'll put it this way, it was obviously a major, major event taking place in the South, just a few miles from Columbus, Georgia, that is, Montgomery, Alabama, just what, two hours' drive maybe, and right next door, major activities and right nearby, and Atlanta [Georgia], of course, is an hour away from Columbus, Georgia.  So, and this activity, these events that were taking place were designed to fundamentally change the South, fundamentally change our country, and yet there's no information about it, two hours away, one hour away, what conclusion would you have (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we were the majority population in many areas of the South, including in the area where I lived.
Speaker 1: Okay, I was going to ask that question too.  So, blacks were the majority in Columbus?
Speaker 2: We were the majority population in the State of Georgia, I think, until the 1950s, and in that Columbus, Georgia area, I believe, we were very much so, easily the majority in that area.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, it was certainly not in our interest, or as whites saw it, the ones who ruled that area, that is the leadership, that we know that these events were taking place and be inspired by them.
Story_ID: 253580
Speaker 1: Now did your leadership in church [Antioch Baptist Church, Columbus, Georgia] ever talk about any of the activities, the civil rights activities (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The churches I attended, no.  It was, they were interesting.  The churches were as much, I remember very well when I was growing up, they were, they served a lot of purposes.  They were an emotional release from the stress that was there on a daily basis.  I remember, these were not Pentecostal churches that I attended.  My family was not Pentecostal but still the churches, the Baptist church, was a very active church.  There's a lot of drama going on in the church all the time.  A lot of shouting and people falling out and all this type of thing.  Lots of very dramatic singing and this type of thing, et cetera, and so the churches were, they represented an opportunity to express one's emotions and just at a tremendous release from the prior weeks' difficulties and then in addition to that, they were great social venues as well.  I remember very well the Easter picnic that, that is the Easter, picnics that we used to have during the summertime.  They were fantastic picnics.  Lots of food, lots of people from the other surrounding area.  They were truly, it was wonderful to go to the picnics.  Lots of girls, everything you could imagine.  It's all there but nothing political at all.  That was, not in the church I attended, not one word that I, I mean, none of that.  The songs, I remember, yeah, and you grew up singing the songs but [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] name mentioned or a civil rights, nothing, nothing whatsoever.
Speaker 1: So did you really have a sense of who Dr. King was before you left the South?
Speaker 2: No, I never heard of him.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you would have left around '62 [1962], I guess, right?
Speaker 2: I left in nineteen--I left the South in 1957.
Speaker 1: Oh, '57 [1957].  Oh, yes, that's two years away (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Excuse me, I'm sorry, not '57 [1957].  Yes, I did leave--
Speaker 1: Yeah, '58 [1958].
Speaker 2: I left, I left in, right, I left--
Speaker 1: You're right, 'cause I went two years the opposite way so you're like 1947, so--
Speaker 2: Right, I left around 1957, '58 [1958], right.
Speaker 1: Fifty-seven [1957], right.
Speaker 2: Right, I never had heard of him.  Of course the Civil Rights Movement was just really getting, going big but I, no, I had not known him, no.

Speaker 1: The [maternal] family moved [from Columbus, Georgia] to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Cincinnati, Ohio.
Speaker 1: Cincinnati.  Did you have relatives in Cincinnati?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had relatives there.  Most of my relatives had come here to Chicago [Illinois] but we had some in Cincinnati, Ohio.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, how long did you stay in Cincinnati?
Speaker 2: We lived there for three years.  I went to elementary school there.
Speaker 1: What was the name of your school?
Speaker 2: Five years, five years.  I went to elementary school there.  I went to Harriet Beecher Stowe [School, Cincinnati, Ohio], Harriet Beecher Stowe Elementary School.
Speaker 1: Okay, now that's interesting.  That's, Harriet Beecher Stowe was a, was it in the spirit of Harriet Beecher Stowe?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No, no, it wasn't.  I mean, it was just a name.  It didn't mean anything to us, honestly it didn't.  It's just an elementary school as far as we, we were concerned and the name had no real significance to us.  Of course, now, I know that it does and I went there two years, fifth grade and sixth grade, and then junior high school at Abigail Cutter, Abigail Cutter Junior High School [Cincinnati, Ohio], seventh, eighth and ninth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In 1957.
Story_ID: 253582
Speaker 1: How did you feel about the move [from Columbus, Georgia]?  Did you, were you excited about going to Cincinnati [Ohio] or did you, or did you feel like you were leaving something behind in Georgia or?
Speaker 2: Well, growing up in the South as a little boy, up to the age of ten, it was a childhood home and as a very young child, we played with other children, of course, and so the major drama of life that adults suffer, of course, it had no real impact on us.  Our families made sure that it did not and we just went to school.  We went past the white children's school to get to our school.  We just had farther to walk but still we thought our school [Claflin School, Columbus, Georgia] was as good as their school and we always had enough to eat.  And so, we had fun playing our games with each other as blacks and then black children and play with the white children.  So, I didn't see the South as a very oppressive place as a child because my [maternal] family, of course, protected us as children from the harsh realities that were all about us.
Speaker 1: So you never heard people talk about lynching or--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --or that kind of or did you when you were--
Speaker 2: Well, not really, not lynchings.  We never heard people talk about that except that we knew that they took place because somebody would say something about it and I'll be honest with you, our people were really genuinely afraid of white people.  I didn't really know that as a child but in a joke that I told you, that was expressed in that joke and we were afraid of whites because of our long history of suffering at their hands and we knew that lynchings took place, definitely so, and I remember very well hearing something about the Emmett Till story, the lynching and the brutal murder of Emmett Till.  I remember my folks talking about that but it was not something that was really talked about a lot around the children but the terror that whites inflicted on us in the South, yeah, we, I'll be honest, excuse me, with you, we felt that.  We really did.  Now we had very cordial relations with whites, as I said earlier, but they were cordial relations within a context of our knowing our place and whites knowing their place.  Their place was a superior place, ours was an inferior place and as long as we stayed within those boundaries, then they treated us as respectful, people to be respected and we did likewise but the harsh realities of the lynchings, these type of, yeah, we knew that that was there and we were really, there was fear.  We were really afraid of whites.  We really were, honestly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we saw white policemen, when we saw them, or the sheriff, these were people we feared.  We did not see them as people who were protective of us, not at all, no, we were very afraid.  If ever they came to our neighborhoods, everybody was scared of them.
Story_ID: 253583
Speaker 1: Did Cincinnati [Ohio] change your perception at all, I mean, when you went, was Cincinnati different [from Columbus, Georgia] in any major way?
Speaker 2: Well it was a bigger city, that's one thing and there was more to do, I remember that.  There was a YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] and a boys club.  I used to go to them all the time.  Certainly it was different in terms of race relations, too, in many ways.
Speaker 1: What neighborhood did you live in in Cincinnati?
Speaker 2: I lived right near, when we first moved to Cincinnati, I lived right on Eighth Avenue near the [Cincinnati] City Hall.  I don't remember the name of it anymore.  Then later on I moved to Avondale [Cincinnati, Ohio] but the first few years we lived right, in a black neighborhood, but, right near, right near, right in downtown Cincinnati.  Of course, the city has changed fundamentally since then, but again, even in Cincinnati, black people and white people knew their place, really, I'll be very honest with you, but it was fundamentally different because when I went to [Abigail Cutter] Junior High School [Cincinnati, Ohio], I went to an integrated junior high school.  There were whites there and it was a very interesting experience but my elementary school [Harriet Beecher Stowe School, Cincinnati, Ohio] was all black.  So it was very different but at the same time, we were just a different people than we are today.  Very much so.  Right.  We, we really, we knew how to act, so to speak, meaning that we, there were clearly defined ways for us to act as black people around whites and we did that in Cincinnati, we did that in Columbus, Georgia.
Story_ID: 253584
Speaker 1: Did you do well in school in Cincinnati [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was an excellent student all along.  I've always, in all my years, I was an excellent student.  School was always a way out for me.
Speaker 1: What was your favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: History.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: Because it always, for me, it explains to me why--people do the things they do and how, how they go about doing things they do and it also gives an explanation, it points the way to the future and how to get there.
Speaker 1: Did you have any favorite periods of time that you, that you liked in those days when you studied history or any favorite stories?
Speaker 2: Yes I do.  I like American history a great deal.  I like, well I like history, period, our own people's history.  When I say our own people's history, I'm not, in this sense I'm not speaking of just blacks but our people in America, whites as well, and the Native Americans.  American history (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But I'm talking about in those days, I mean, when you were studying, did you have a favorite, you know, period of time in those days?
Speaker 2: Back then, no, I didn't have a favorite.  I just liked it.  I just enjoyed reading history and hearing about it, very, very much so, always my favorite, but I didn't have any particular era of American history that I liked or any particular era of world history that I liked.  Now I do, of course.
Story_ID: 253585
Speaker 1: Now in Cincinnati [Ohio], you said that, that you started hearing about the Civil Rights Movement and news started trickling down, you know, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, very much so, very much so.  We were freer in Cincinnati, black people, and it was a much bigger city.  There were more people who had, black people who had means than there were in Columbus, Georgia, meaning there were more black teachers, there were more black policemen.  I don't even know if there were any black policemen in Columbus, Georgia.  There may have been one, I think, on the whole force but, maybe none at all, and so there were more people, and there were more, more of a diverse work force there.  There were people who worked in the factories and this type of thing, like Colgate-[Palmolive (sic.)]--
Speaker 1: Procter and--
Speaker 2: Procter & Gamble [Company], a big factory there, et cetera.  So people worked in the factories and then in Columbus, Georgia there were textile mills but they were extremely low paying jobs and mostly whites held those jobs but some of us, but still whites held them because it's still a higher level of employment in what we were generally used to.  So there were more people there who, in Cincinnati, who had means and, black people, and there were more resources in the black community as a result.  The churches were much more active.  They did talk politics in the churches, no question about it.  I learned about Jet magazine.  I used to sell Jet magazine at a very early age, as a young child starting at ten years old.  I sold it for a number of years and so I'd read Jet and that was a new world for me, completely new world.  So, Cincinnati was a real turning point for me, no question about it, because it, it opened up an entirely new world but at the same time, like I said, even though as black people, we acted along certain contours in order to make sure we had smooth relations with whites.  Nonetheless, Cincinnati was quite a bit different than what I grew up, then Columbus, Georgia, I knew.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, so you, you were there about three years, right, and then you--
Speaker 2: Five years I was in Cincinnati, Ohio.
Speaker 1: Five, okay, five.  So did you, you didn't finish high school there, though, did you?
Speaker 2: No, I came to high school, I didn't even, I did not attend high school there, I attended high school [Parker High School; Paul Robeson High School] here in Chicago [Illinois].
Story_ID: 253586
Speaker 1: Why did the [maternal] family move to Chicago [Illinois]?  Was there--
Speaker 2: Looking for better opportunities, work opportunities.  My mother [Annie Bennett], when I lived in Cincinnati [Ohio], when I lived in Columbus, Georgia, I lived in my grandmother's home all the time I was there and my mother moved to Cincinnati with her husband, my stepfather, and that's when I finally moved with my mother and her husband, that was in Cincinnati, I lived with them, and I lived with them for four years there in Cincinnati.  Then it was a turbulent home life and the fifth year I was in Cincinnati, I moved in with my grandfather on my stepfather's side.  My stepfather's father lived in Cincinnati.  So I moved in with them and then my mother left Cincinnati in 1962 and came here to Chicago.  We had relatives here and when she came here, I didn't stay with her anymore, I stayed with my uncle--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --uncle here.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were about fourteen, I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was fourteen years old when I came here.
Story_ID: 253587
Speaker 1: Did that kind of shake you up--all the moving around and, and--
Speaker 2: When we lived in Cincinnati [Ohio], I think we lived in a different apartment like every month, every two months, three months, because they didn't pay, my folks didn't pay the rent, couldn't pay the rent.  So I lived all over Cincinnati.  You asked me where, the neighborhood I lived in and I mentioned the one near [Cincinnati] City Hall, downtown, and then eventually Avondale [Cincinnati, Ohio].  Well, we lived a lot of places downtown.  We lived in Avondale.  I don't remember all the different places that we, the neighborhood, the names of the neighborhoods, but in the five years I lived in Cincinnati, I think I just about lived in every poor neighborhood there was in Cincinnati, all over the place, just everywhere.  So, I think your question was, did it shake me up (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, did it kind of shake, I mean, you were a good student in school and everything but all this moving around and kind of disruptive home life kind of--
Speaker 2: Right.  What I used to do was to, to always, to the best that I could, I tried to stay in the same school even though it meant, and even when I moved to Chicago [Illinois], it was the same situation.  I lived at one point, way on the West Side out on Keeler Avenue, past Kedzie [Avenue], but I stayed at Parker High School [Paul Robeson High School] on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois].  I didn't change schools.  I always stayed at the same school even though it meant traveling across town at times to get to the school because the school represented stability for me, that was a stable place, and I liked school.  And so even though my home life was very unstable, meaning a lot of moving around, and a lot of turbulence in the home, still school was, represented stability.  So even though we moved around the city of Cincinnati quite a lot, I always went to the same school.  Same thing in Chicago.  I stayed at the same high school.
Story_ID: 253588
Speaker 1: So you went to Parker High School [Paul Robeson High School, Chicago, Illinois] here?
Speaker 2: Right, I went to Parker High School here, right at [West] 68th [Street] and Stewart [Avenue].
Speaker 1: Right, so were you a good student at Parker?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was a very good student, excellent student at Parker High School, excellent student junior high school [Abigail Cutter Junior High School, Cincinnati, Ohio], excellent student elementary school, all throughout I was always an excellent student, A student.
Speaker 1: Did you work in high school, too?
Speaker 2: I worked in the summer, every summer I worked.  I always worked, every summer.  I didn't, I didn't work during the school year at, I don't think I ever did that, but every summer, as far as I can remember, I always had a job, doing something.  I worked here in Chicago [Illinois] when I was in high school.  I worked at Spiegel catalog [Chicago, Illinois] one summer.  For two summers I worked on the [Atchison, Topeka and] Santa Fe Railroad washing dishes, traveling from Chicago to Los Angeles [California].  Yeah, that was a fascinating job.  It was an eye-opening experience.  This was in 1960--
Speaker 1: You can do that as a teenager, really?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in high school.  I was, nobody ever paid too much attention to the age.  You just say you're eighteen and go to work, or whatever.  So I did that after my senior year in high school, and actually I did it in college [Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire] as well, and let's see, yeah, I always had a job and working on the train was very interesting.  I did that two summers, traveling to California about ten times every year, every summer, and also to Texas.  The train went to Texas (laughter).
Story_ID: 253589
Speaker 1: What kind of things did you learn about all that travel, you know, through all that travel and--
Speaker 2: Well, it was very interesting.  One good feature of it was the, my co-workers [on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad], who were much older men in many instances, who had been working on the train for many years, this was in the early 1960s, and I was a low man on the ship so I had to, I not only had the least desirable job in the kitchen and, but I also had to make everybody's bunk, in the sleeping car, and I'd get paid for it, the men would pay me, but I'd get a chance to listen to their stories because they had been traveling to California for twenty, thirty years, working on the railroad, twenty, thirty years as cooks and waiters and this was in the age, this was the very last part of the elite transportation by railroad here in the United States and these men had been part of that system for many years.  In other words, the Santa Fe Super Chief, that was the elite train that carried the Hollywood celebrities from California to Chicago [Illinois] to New York [New York] and I worked on that train as a dishwasher in the very last years of its existence and it was a fascinating experience to be there with the waiters and the cooks who had worked on that train for twenty, thirty years, and I'd listen to the stories of people they had met, the whites they had met, the celebrities, white celebrities they had met on the train, and I saw them dressed on the Super Chief and the tuxedos and it was quite a, quite a very interesting experience.  So that was one aspect of it.  That--
Speaker 1: Did you meet any celebrities on the, on the trips?
Speaker 2: I never did, no, I, no I never did.
Speaker 1: Who were the ones that they talked about?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Oh, my goodness.  They met 'em all.  They all traveled on the train.  I can't recall any specific names but, I mean, I can mention Cary Grant.  I can mention Edward G. Robinson, John Wayne, these people had met, met these stars.
Speaker 1: So all these, all these stars.
Speaker 2: Yes, they have.  They had served them dinner.  They had served them as they traveled on the train, et cetera, and then, of course, being in California, way back in the 1960s, was a very interesting experience.  Los Angeles [California], for example, is a very city, very different city today than it was in 1964 and 1965.  It was a much smaller place.  It was not this glamorous place that it is now and I remember being downtown Los Angeles, living, or staying in a hotel for the crew, train crew there for two and three days, when we would travel there.  And then, also, at the end of each summer, I would spend about two weeks out in Los Angeles, Long Beach [California] and that entire area, just relaxing before I came back here to go to school.
Speaker 1: You make, make friends out there in California?
Speaker 2: Yes I did, young people my age.
Speaker 1: Okay, well--
Speaker 2: I'd travel all around the area.  Just get on a bus and just go around.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were a pretty self-reliant kid, I mean a teenager, I guess?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was, I was from, from a very early age.  I didn't live with my mother [Annie Bennett] starting at about age fourteen.  I just lived with relatives and I always took care of myself from the time I was fourteen.
Story_ID: 253590
Speaker 1: We were talking off, off camera about the conditions on the train and you said, first of all, there's a color-coded system.  Can you explain that to us?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, very much so.  Well, I worked on the [Atchison, Topeka and] Santa Fe Railroad line and there were two trains that I worked on.  One was the [Santa Fe] Super Chief which was the elite train, maybe carried 125 passengers at most and that was where those persons who had the most money, the Hollywood celebrities, for example, would travel.  Then there was the El Capitan.  The El Capitan was a train that might carry 700 people from, 700 passengers from say, Chicago [Illinois] to Los Angeles [California], and these would be the lower fare passengers, let's say, put it that way, but the train life for the workers was a very, for the black workers, was a very difficult one, very, very difficult one, very grueling one.  It was certainly color-coded.  The light, lighter skinned blacks were the waiters and the darker skinned blacks, like myself, we were the ones assigned to the kitchen, and life in the kitchen was very, very difficult.  The quarters, of course, that is the quarters or, for preparing the meals, were extremely cramped and extremely hot and the food preparation, obviously, was exquisite because we were serving, in the case of the Super Chief, people who demanded high quality cuisine.  And even on the El Capitan, food had to be of top quality and it was, and to see these black men produce that high quality food like that in such cramped quarters, with the train moving, what eighty miles an hour, steady in motion, and these men would work, everybody would work, including me, we would work what like almost what, we'd get, we'd work like about maybe eighteen hours a day.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now that is something that--
Speaker 2: About, yeah, we'd get like four hours of sleep at most.
Speaker 1: Yeah, we've interviewed some Pullman porters, a couple, and they both, one man was ninety, he's a hundred now, but he was saying that that was the toughest part of being a Pullman porter.  He was never a cook, but he said, just making beds and stuff was all he did, he said, but, but you'd have to do it almost without any sleep.  You'd have to go--
Speaker 2: Almost no sleep, almost no sleep, and when we would finally sleep, go to sleep, it would be like three in the morning and we'd have to be up in the kitchen at five in the morning.  So you had maybe two hours, it's just out of sheer exhaustion for everybody, including me, but the job paid well compared to what other workers made, the ones we knew made in our communities, et cetera.  So we took those jobs but there was no glamour associated with that job at all except in the minds of the people who didn't do it but it was a very, very grueling job and we just didn't have an opportunity to work, as blacks, work in those jobs on the train that offered real glamour, maybe being the conductor, for example, were always dressed nicely and you're just checking tickets and walking through the car or whatever, smiling, but no we didn't do that, we actually had to serve people in one way or another.  It was a very, very difficult job.
Story_ID: 253591
Speaker 1: So if there's, there's any glamour at all, it occurred at the destination then, right, when you finally got there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yes, and for me it did because, of course, the older workers would be bone tired and to be honest with you, they talked about women all the time and had women (laughter) all the time.
Speaker 1: At the point of destination and at the point of origin, or anywhere else?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, very much so.  That was a major feature of their conversation.  I won't go into great detail about that but they talked about women all the time, and they had money to spend on women.
Speaker 1: Now, what did they call you?  Oh, I'm sorry, they had lots of money, but--
Speaker 2: To spend on women.
Speaker 1: But what did they call you?  You said that they--
Speaker 2: Oh, they called me young blood, they called me Junior, always a nickname and that's, the other name they would call me too, I won't say those on camera but they were, they were affectionate name but they all had some kind of sexual orientation to it or something like that but positive though in the sense that it had nothing to do with any kind of homosexuality, nothing.  I never saw any of that on the train.  Never any of that, even though we all lived in very, very close quarters with each other, and it's just men, just men sleeping together in the small crew quarters, but it was a very fascinating experience for me, no question about it, on the train [of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad], at the point of destination, having an opportunity to travel, California, Southern California, see that area, traveling Texas and see that area as well, it was very interesting for me, fascinating experience.
Speaker 1: Okay, how did that affect you when you went back to school and, you know, in the fall after, you know, serving?  I mean, did you, did it broaden your--
Speaker 2: Yes it did.  It, and that was a very fortunate thing for me is that that experience, just like traveling or moving to Cincinnati [Ohio] from the South, it was the beginning of a much broader world for me, a world away from these narrow confines of, of acting certain ways around white people.  Those were the beginnings of a world of discovery for me, really.  A world that, beginnings of a world that showed me just a much bigger world than what I had grown up in in the South and what I had saw in Cincinnati.  So, it was, yes, it always, it was the beginning of something new for me in a very positive, excuse me, a very positive way.
Story_ID: 253592
Speaker 1: Did you see yourself as a lawyer then?  I mean, did you, did you envision that, at that point?
Speaker 2: Yeah, when I was in, when I was in Cincinnati [Ohio] I, in junior high school [Abigail Cutter Junior High School, Cincinnati, Ohio], I thought, yeah, I'd like to be a lawyer.
Speaker 1: What was your inspiration for being a lawyer?
Speaker 2: I saw that lawyers could help people and I saw as I learned about the Civil Rights Movement, there are always lawyers involved and court fights and this type of thing, the court, or litigation in court, in the courts, and I saw that lawyers played a significant role and I said to myself, maybe, I'd like to try to do that someday.
Speaker 1: Did you have any role models as lawyers who lived in your--
Speaker 2: No, I had no, no role model, no.  I knew who Thurgood Marshall was, of course, and some of his colleagues, but they were not role models for me, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you didn't really know any lawyers in Cincinnati or Chicago [Illinois], did you?
Speaker 2: I did not know of any lawyers, no, personally, no, I didn't at all.
Story_ID: 253593
Speaker 1: Now did you have any teachers in school that were, you know, outstanding in terms of being a role model for you or supporting you in any way or helping?
Speaker 2: There were teachers who were definitely very helpful to me, not as role models in a sense of people I wanted to be like, but there were people who were very supportive of me because I was pretty much on my own from the time I was fourteen, meaning that I had relatives who were helpful and my mother [Annie Bennett], I always was very close to my mother and always in contact with my mother, even though I did not live with my mother.  So my mother was always a constant presence in my life and the most important figure in my life without question, but since I was pretty much living independently of my mother, and I was just fourteen years old, I found, fortunately, or blessedly however you want to say it, people who were very supportive and then there were whites who were very supportive of me when I was in school as well as black people who were very supportive of me.  There was a man named Mr. Alexander [ph.], I can't, I don't know Mr. Alexander's first name, but he was very supportive of me when I was in junior high school [Abigail Cutter Junior High School, Cincinnati, Ohio].  He was, he took the lead in arranging for me to get a scholarship to attend junior high school.  I didn't have the money.  This is a public school I was attending but I didn't have money to eat and no money for clothes.  And so, there was some type of a foundation in Cincinnati [Ohio] or community trust of some kind which gave me, at the beginning of my enrollment in this program, ten dollars, I think it was every two weeks or, I had ten dollars for every two weeks for certain basic expenses.  That would be lunch money and basic necessities and then later on it was expanded to about fifteen dollars, I think it was, and maybe twenty dollars at one point, which was enough money to, to keep me going, and they always, he and others, whites as well as blacks, made sure I had clothes, and then in high school [Parker High School; Paul Robeson High School, Chicago, Illinois], it was the same.  There was a lady who's still living, named Peggy Duke, counselor at the school, who was very instrumental in making sure I always had basic things that I needed.  Of course, by that time, I was able to work during the summer months on jobs since I was older and stronger, on jobs that paid enough money to really give me enough money to help, I certainly bought all of my clothes when I was in high school  because I could work and do that, so, nobody had to help me with that anymore, but still I needed help from time to time, maybe with lunch money or something like that, and Mrs. Duke always made sure I was well provided for and, like I said, the school was a place of stability and a place of support for me.  So, even though I did a lot of moving in junior high school, and some moving around a good bit in high school, I always made sure I stayed at the same school because that was a place of support and a place of stability.

Speaker 1: Did you get involved in school activities at Parker [High School; Paul Robeson High School, Chicago, Illinois] and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, very much so.  I was always one of the leading students at every school I attended, academically, top student, first or second in my class, everywhere I attended, academically.  I played sports at Parker.  I was on the football team.  That was the one sport I did play and--
Speaker 1: What did you play?
Speaker 2: Halfback, I was running back.  I played in college as well, at Dartmouth College [Hanover, New Hampshire], but also on a number, at a number of clubs, student clubs, that were part of the student extracurricular activities.  [Abigail Cutter] Junior High School [Cincinnati, Ohio] the same.  It was an integrated junior high school.  I was a top student academically.  I think I was the second ranked student in the class in junior high school, maybe number one ranked in the school, first or second, and I was, I played in the school orchestra.  I played the viola and I played in the marching band.  I played the bass drum in the marching band.  Ferris, I was in the, certain social clubs, I don't remember what they were, but I was one of the top students at the school, easily, so every school I attended it was always, at Dartmouth, et cetera, as well.
Speaker 1: Where did you get, get the strength to, to be so productive in the light of such a, kind of a disruptive family situation, all the moving and the domestic stuff, I mean, how did you?
Speaker 2: I'm not too sure.  I really don't know.  One of the things is that I'm going to say it comes from my mother [Annie Bennett], from the women in my family, my mother, my grandmother and my great-grandmother.  They were always great motivators.  They were always, my mother in particular, my mother had a very difficult life but at the same time, my mother was, and is, a very strong, strong person and a person of great character, tremendous integrity, always been that way, and a very highly motivated person, a person who always sought the very best and who always wanted to show everybody, white people and her own family, that she could rise above the circumstances and a lot of what I am is my mother, really.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she, was she in school when you were in school?  I mean, becoming a nurse and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was, and she struggled to pass the state licensing exam in Cincinnati, Ohio, Ohio, State of Ohio, but she passed it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she's a very, very determined person, very much so.  So I think it's fair to say I'm a lot like my mother in many, many ways.
Story_ID: 253595
Speaker 1: When you were on the--a senior on the verge of graduation, did you, did you, I suppose you knew you were going to go to college, but how did you wind up at an Ivy League school like Dartmouth [College, Hanover, New Hampshire]?  I mean, what happened?
Speaker 2: Well my ambition when I was at Parker High School [Paul Robeson High School, Chicago, Illinois] was to stay on the same campus for college.  There was, on that campus for Parker High School, located at [West] 68th [Street] and Stewart [Avenue], there was an elementary school there, there was a high, junior high school, there's a high school, there was a junior college, [Woodrow] Wilson Junior College [Kennedy-King College, Chicago, Illinois] and Chicago Teachers College [Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois], a four-year school.  I was planning to go to Wilson Junior College.  I figured I could afford that.  I could work for myself, work, and make the money to pay the fees for Wilson Junior College, so that's where I thought about going.  I didn't think about going to a four-year school because I didn't see any way to, to afford going anywhere else.  But at any rate, at that time, when I was in high school, that was the height of the Civil Rights Movement, of course, and at that time, whites in some of the elite schools, like Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Dartmouth, et cetera, were looking for very capable or very qualified African American students, and they looked at Parker High School where I was attending school and to be honest with you, I had never even heard of Dartmouth College, at the time that these people approached Parker, and I was identified as one of the students who could do well at Dartmouth and so I was given a full scholarship to attend there.  I applied to a number of schools across the country, schools that recruited, were recruiting, these are major schools, major universities recruiting African American students in 1965, '64 [1964] and '65 [1965], and I was accepted at all these schools, every one I applied to and so I chose Dartmouth and I'm glad I did.  It was a different environment from anything I'd ever experienced but it was a very good one for me.
Story_ID: 253596
Speaker 1: Why did you choose Dartmouth [College, Hanover, New Hampshire]?
Speaker 2: Why did, what now?
Speaker 1: Why did you choose Dartmouth of all the others?
Speaker 2: I chose it because it was, it was the best.  It was ranked with the very best and I wanted to excel at the best, that's why I chose Dartmouth College.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so, you went to Dartmouth in '65 [1965], was it?
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-five [1965].
Speaker 1: Okay, and you played football?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I played football there.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I didn't want to play.  In fact, when I, I just wanted to do well, academically, and I knew that the school was very challenging and I wasn't sure I could really do well.  So I wanted to spend all my time studying but the football coach [R.L. "Bob" Blackman] insisted that I play, and this is the freshman football coach, and I didn't even go out to practice the first week or so and, but this gentleman insisted that I play and so finally I had to play, but I didn't want to play.  So I didn't learn the playbook, I didn't, it was really difficult the first year, but I was a pretty good player.  So I played and then I continued to play.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you play all four years?
Speaker 2: I didn't play my senior year.  I just stopped playing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But when I actually, when I was on the team, I actually played in the games.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And I regret it not playing my senior year but I didn't play my senior year because I thought I, the coach was racist and I thought it was just unfair and the relationship I had with him and I, now over the years, and many years ago, I wished I had continued to play but, but it was a good learning experience for me.
Speaker 1: Okay, was the coach racist in retrospect?
Speaker 2: In my view, yes.  It was very much so.  He was an extremely successful coach, football coach.  Yeah, it was part of a culture that was very much racist and, yes, I thought he was, yes, and I'm sure folks wouldn't like me, hear me say that about him because he's an icon at the school, but I was one of, oh gosh, I was one of, I was the only black person on the traveling team and there was, what, two of us on the team and I just didn't think he was fair at all, so.
Story_ID: 253597
Speaker 1: You say you enjoyed Dartmouth [College, Hanover, New Hampshire] but, how many other black students were there?  Did--
Speaker 2: At the time that I went to Dartmouth in 1965, I think there were sixteen, seventeen in our class, blacks, and maybe a total of thirty at the school out of about four thousand students, maybe thirty of us or so, total, out of four classes.
Speaker 1: Now that's a real minority.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a very difficult experience.  Totally white environment.  I mean, almost everybody white except for us few students.  The town, completely white.  It was a very different kind of experience I have ever had experienced in my life but in many ways a very good experience, a very difficult one because it was so different culturally, and quite a great deal of adjustment and the school is very isolated from urban areas, not so much today, but it's still located the same place so it's still out in the country but Boston [Massachusetts] is much more accessible now than it was then because now there's a major highway, divided highway, that goes between Dartmouth and Hanover, New Hampshire.  Then the airlines fly from Chicago [Illinois] to Manchester, New Hampshire and back then there was nothing like that.  The only air travel, which I couldn't afford, was from Chicago to Boston so I took the Greyhound bus, which took forever, as you can imagine, going from Chicago to Hanover, New Hampshire, through every small town from here to New Hampshire.  So, but it was a real good experience because it was very, it was very challenging, academically, and just challenging in terms of meeting and getting to know white people for the first time and I, that was a very good experience for me.  A very good experience.
Speaker 1: So, well, what did you major in?
Speaker 2: History.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: History.
Speaker 1: What, what phase of history?  I mean, what--
Speaker 2: It was just American history.  I was an honor student in history.
Story_ID: 253598
Speaker 1: Who were some of your teachers at Dartmouth [College, Hanover, New Hampshire]?
Speaker 2: There was a professor named Jere Daniell, D-A-N-I-E-L-L.  I didn't have any black professors at all, they're all white, but Jere Daniell was a noted history teacher at Dartmouth and then there was also a man named Eliot Spitzer [ph.].  Those are two who I remember very well.  Mr. Spitzer taught African history, Mr. Daniell taught general American history, American revolutionary history, the history of the American Revolution in that early period, the frontier period in American history, colonial period in American history.  And then there was another professor I had there, there are two others whom I liked very much.  One was in govern--Mr. Christian [P.] Potholm, he was very familiar with Africa and he introduced me, for the first time, to a noted African liberation movement leader, that was Eduardo Mondlane, who was the founder of FRELIMO, the Mozambique Liberation Movement [sic. Mozambique Liberation Front].  Mr. Mondlane visited Hanover, New Hampshire at the beginning of my sophomore year, I think it was, or sometime, maybe it was my freshman year, at some point, my second semester my freshman year, in 1966 and I met Eduardo Mondlane who was later killed by the  Portuguese secret police [International and State Defense Police (PIDE)] but I met him up in New Hampshire, or Vermont, it was right across the border from Hanover, he was visiting, Mr. Mondlane was visiting a white man there, a farmer, who was a supporter of the liberation struggles in Southern Africa and a financial supporter as well, and it was a very interesting experience for me to spend, actually, a weekend with Mr. Mondlane and Mr. Christian Potholm introduced me to Mr. Mondlane and that was real, that was a very interesting experience.  And then there's also an English teacher I had, Mr. Gettleman [ph.], and I liked English, I liked to write, grammar and all that and Mr. Gettleman was a noted teacher there as well, so those four.
Story_ID: 253599
Speaker 1: Late '60s [1960s], so, you didn't have any, any African American history at all at Dartmouth [College, Hanover, New Hampshire] (unclear)?
Speaker 2: At that time, no, I don't recall anything like that.  No, not at all.
Speaker 1: Had you started to become aware of--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, very much so.  Of course the Civil Rights Movement was in full steam.  At that time, Dartmouth didn't have any African American student organizations or nothing like that and I was one of the founders of the Afro-American, we called it the Afro-Am, the Afro-American Society [AAM].  I was one of the leaders of the student movement at Dartmouth.  In fact, I would be willing to say I was a principal leader in the early years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We used to meet some of the friends, my friends and I when we were freshmen, second semester freshmen and sophomores, we would meet to discuss various issues in the black community and generally the meeting would take place in my room and we sophomores led the demonstrations that took place on campus and it was later that the junior, the juniors and the seniors took part and really became the official officers of what we had started.  And that was a very interesting experience, too, because I learned that, from that is that, well to put it this way, as the younger people, younger that is, the lower classmen, leading the protest marches, first for us, it was, there was a demonstration against [Governor] George Wallace, for example, this is in '68 [1968], but long before George Wallace came, and that demonstration we led--
Speaker 1: So he came to campus?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in 1968, when he was running for president, '67 [1967], '68 [1968], and that demonstration we had, that I led then, it made national newspapers and also the CBS News but long before he came to the campus, we had, I and others had led demonstrations against spokespersons for the Portuguese government and the South African government who visited campus.
Speaker 1: Okay, now that's something that you'd almost have to be in college in those days to even know about, you know--
Speaker 2: That was my first experience with that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) --'cause most black people would not even know who these people are or what they represent.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  It was an eye-opening experience for me in 1966 to hear of representatives from Portugal coming to speak on the Dartmouth [College, Hanover, New Hampshire] campus justifying, attempting to justify the Portuguese policies in Mozambique, Angola and Guinea-Bissau.  It was an eye-opening experience for me and I led demonstrations against them and that was a fascinating experience and then also, South Africa, the same, and so that was in early '66 [1966].  And then later on, there was a movement for introduction of African American studies at the different universities across the country and Dartmouth was one of the first ones to do that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: And by then, I had stepped back and the other freshmen had stepped back and sophomores had stepped back since we were the lower classmen, so to speak, to allow the juniors and seniors to take the lead and by then it was more acceptable to have the demonstration.  When I first, we first started, it was not acceptable to have these student demonstrations so it's more risky, much more so, and then later on when it was clear to the others who were farther along in school, that it was okay to have these things, then the others stepped in and then they wanted to lead.  It was very interesting.  So we said, okay, you guys are juniors and seniors, then you take the lead.  But then they took it in a different way than we the lower classmen wanted to take it because it became more acceptable, the whole program.  It was a very interesting experience, yeah.

Speaker 1: You came out in 1969, right?
Speaker 2: Sixty-nine [1969].
Speaker 1: Right, okay, and did, had you had, was your mind made up on what you were going to do?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I wanted to go to Yale [Law School, New Haven, Connecticut].  I mean, I wanted to go to law school.  So I applied to four law schools.  I was a very good student at Dartmouth [College, Hanover, New Hampshire], big man on campus so to speak, a leader in student government, on the football team, at least through my junior year, and an honor student, but I wasn't, I mean I had changed quite a bit in terms of how I looked at a lot of things and I wasn't so, I wasn't the, the Negro student that I was when I first entered school.  I had a very different perspective on America, our people's role in it and my role.  I wanted to go to law school without question but I didn't want to go to law school just to become a lawyer and follow the prescribed behavioral patterns that had already been established for us.  I wanted something different because I knew that in order to, for our people to advance, there had to be something different, really did.  One couldn't just be the traditional Negro, so to speak, traditional Negro ambitions and still make for real change for our people and for our country as a whole.
Story_ID: 253601
Speaker 1: I want to rewind a little bit back to the assassination of Malcolm X.  You mentioned him earlier and I know it's someone you've paid attention to but he was assassinated when you were in high school, right, you were a senior in high school at Parker [High School; Paul Robeson High School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yes, in 1965, and I remember Malcolm X from when I was living here in Chicago [Illinois].  He appeared on television here in an interview program.  I never met him but I saw him on TV a few times and he was just outstanding.  It was a new experience for me and I didn't like him at first but my uncle liked him a lot and I grew up listening to jazz music and, because my uncles listened to jazz music, they were my two uncles here in Chicago, they were really hip and the music and the politics of Malcolm X were expressions of their hipness, so to speak, not hip for the sake of being hip, so to speak, but that's who they were.  They liked the music and they liked the politics and it was through my uncles that I came to appreciate Malcolm X and really enjoy Malcolm X, what he was saying and see the merits of what he was saying because they did, they were much older than me, of course, and more experienced and so they could see Malcolm X's politics in relationship to their experiences and our history much more so than I could.  So, I didn't really appreciate fully who Malcolm X was and what he stood for until I was much older myself, but I did like him and his death, it didn't have the kind of impact on me that, say [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.]'s death did, but, in 1968, but still it had an impact because I saw Malcom X as a great figure and it's now, of course, that I see him as the great figure which he truly was.
Story_ID: 253602
Speaker 1: [Reverend] Dr. Martin Luther King [Jr.] was killed in '68 [1968], the year before you graduated from Dartmouth [College, Hanover, New Hampshire]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Can you, there's usually a big story associated with that on every college campus where somebody's in college and King is, well there's a story, people usually remember where they were.  Where were you and do you remember what you were doing when you heard that Dr. King (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, very much so.  I remember very much so, just like with John F. Kennedy's [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] assassination, I remember exactly where I was.  I was in high school [Parker High School; Paul Robeson High School, Chicago, Illinois] in, on--going up from the, on the stairway going from first to the second floor and I heard the news, where with Martin Luther King I was in college, Dartmouth College, and I was attending a student meeting and heard the news and there was great sadness, of course.  Martin Luther King was somebody that we really appreciated and most students, whites as well as blacks, saw the merits of what he was doing.
Speaker 1: So there wasn't a, you didn't see, was there a big difference between how the white students reacted and the black students?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was a big difference but still most whites, I think it's fair to say, appreciated the merits of the Civil Rights Movement, easily so.  I, by that time, in 1968, where I went to school, sure there were some people who were opposed to, to Martin Luther King but most whites were not and they were supportive, but in terms of the reaction at his death, surely there was a big difference between we blacks and, and white students because he, Martin Luther King was one of us and he was in the forefront of a movement that brought real fundamental change to our country and both black people and whites and, I mean, he was our central leader as we saw it and he was gone and for whites he was not their central leader so it didn't have the same kind of impact on them as it did on us even though they were quite supportive where I was, without question.
Story_ID: 253603
Speaker 1: Upon graduating from Dartmouth [College, Hanover, New Hampshire], you were on your way to Yale Law School [New Haven, Connecticut]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was, but before going to Yale, as I said earlier, I made up my mind I wanted to go to Yale. I had been accepted, applied to and been accepted at Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts], Columbia Law School [New York, New York] and the University of Chicago Law School [Chicago, Illinois], as well as Yale, and I thought Yale was number one, which it was ranked number one and I wanted to go to the best and have that challenge and to exceed at the very best but I just didn't want to be the traditional Negro student graduating from those schools, so to speak, and following the same contours as everybody else because I just didn't think that was the way to advance, either our people, black people in the country, or our people in the country as a whole, whites and blacks.  I had had the great fortune of traveling abroad for the first time prior to going to Yale, the summer before traveling to Yale.  Dartmouth had had an oratorical contest, school wide oratorical contest that had a prize for five hundred dollars.  Well I entered the contest and I won it.  So that was my money to travel to Europe in 1969, the summer of 1969.  I, there was a post on a bulletin board that said, Europe, for two hundred and--$220 roundtrip.  So I saw that poster, I didn't have any money, and I saw the notice for the speech contest (laughter), I said that's five hundred dollars.
Speaker 1: It's a scene from a movie it sounds like.
Speaker 2: Five hundred dollars.  If I win the speech contest, I got $500, $200 for the airplane ride roundtrip from New York [New York] to London [England], roundtrip, some obscure airline I had never heard, couldn't even pronounce the name of the airline and it wasn't even a major London airport that the plane was to land at, outside London, but still it was to London.  That was from New York to London, $200 and then I said, I have $300 left and then there was this book that had just come out by Eric Frommer, his last name, Arthur Frommer, 'Europe on Five Dollars a Day' [Arthur Frommer].  So I calculated, gosh, it's five dollars a day and I'm there for so many days, then I should be able to afford it.
Story_ID: 253604
Speaker 1: So I entered the speech contest, wrote my speech and won the speech contest.  So that was my money to travel and I had been a public speaker for quite some time over the years in school and at Dartmouth [College, Hanover, New Hampshire], I had also won the speech department contest for the year, my sophomore and junior years as well, but this was a school wide contest and I entered it and I won it so that gave me the money to travel to Europe and I hitchhiked once I arrived in Europe, London [England].  I lived on five dollars or less every day for about three, three and a half months.  I hitchhiked through eighteen countries in Europe and North Africa.  I started in London, went to Belgium, Amsterdam [the Netherlands], Sweden, Finland, couldn't hitchhike through Eastern Europe, it was Communist controlled at the time so I took the train through Czechoslovakia [Czech Republic and Slovakia], East Germany, but at the same time I lived in the cheapest hostels, I mean it might cost two dollars a night or a dollar fifty cent a night and spent a dollar on the meal for the whole day, you know, you learn how to eat like that so you can make do or whatever.  And so I traveled through, like I said, hitchhiked through those countries I just described except for Czechoslovakia and East Germany, I had to take the train.  I hitchhiked through Austria.  In fact at the time of the landing on the moon in 1969 by Americans, I was in Austria, hitchhiking, and it was at night and I remember seeing on television this photo of the astronauts, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin hopping on the moon and I was at some gas station way up in the mountain, in the Alps, Alps with my backpack on, just hitchhiking and stopped to rest, or get a ride or somewhere, or something, and then hitchhiked through Italy, Sicily [Italy], Tunisia, Algeria.
Story_ID: 253605
Speaker 1: Met Eldridge Cleaver in Algiers [Algeria] at the time, he and his wife, Kathleen [Neal] Cleaver, stopped and spent more time since I didn't have a set itinerary, I can spend as much time as I want, wherever.  He was a very interesting person, obviously.
Speaker 2: Tell us about, any stories about him that you can tell us?
Speaker 1: Well, it was very interesting because I was a very serious student and, and searching student, that's why the travels, and I had read Eldridge Cleaver's book, 'Soul On Ice' [Eldridge Cleaver] and read about him, he and his wife, and of course they had left the United States, apparently fleeing the American government or for some reason or another, I don't remember exactly what, there was some type of police warrant for them from California, I believe.  Anyway, when I arrived in Algiers, the capital of Algeria, I was just walking the street one day, nothing to do, just looking around and here I see Kathleen Cleaver, walking the street.  I knew who she was from the photos.
Speaker 2: You'd seen the [Black] Panther [Party] papers and all that sort of thing by then, they were published.
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly.  So, but I said, "Hello," and introduced myself, of course, and then not a lot of black Americans there so she was very friendly and just took me to meet her husband and went to talk to him and her as well and it was very interesting because he was a very different figure than what I thought he would be.  I had expected to see this very serious, very intellectual revolutionary figure and he wasn't that.
Speaker 2: Well how would you describe him?
Speaker 1: He gave me the impression of somebody who was, who was, I'm trying to think of, well, a good way to say this, so to speak, somebody who, who gloried in his fame, somebody who felt very good about being exalted and that I didn't see him as a person who was committed to real social change for the mass of black people in the United States, in our country as a whole.  I didn't see that in him.  I had expected to see that based on what I had heard and also what I had read in his book, 'Soul On Ice,' but I did not see this principled, revolutionary figure, this principal intellectual figure who had been lionized as a leader of the mass of black people in the United States.  He wasn't that, clearly wasn't that, just based on personal discussions I had.  I was not interested in smoking pot or anything like that and I had no interest in any of that.  Never drank in my life, still don't, never taken any kind of drugs, not even aspirin, and you know, this man is just not my kind of person at all, not at all.  That was not me (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, it was kind of a disappointment?
Speaker 1: Oh, a very big disappointment, right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 253606
Speaker 1: Who else did you meet over there?  I mean, did you meet anybody, were there any other black people that you, did you run across black folks from the continent, in Europe, and--
Speaker 2: Yes, I did, in Paris [France].  I met a number, I didn't meet a lot in just traveling around Europe, say Amsterdam [the Netherlands] or Copenhagen [Denmark] or Rome [Italy], I met a lot of Africans in Rome, a lot of Africans in London [England], of course, Africans in Paris, too, but I met a number of African Americans in Paris for the first time on this trip and there are some people there who had lived there for a while and knew the city well.  I think probably it was in Paris, my first visit to Paris, that I met the first, the largest number of African Americans that I had seen in Europe.  I didn't meet any, I don't recall, I hitchhiked through Spain, through Portugal, through France, through Switzerland, through West Germany, at the time, West Germany--
Speaker 1: Were most of the African Americans you met, I know the stereotypes that they'd be artists, you know, but I, but were they (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No they, yes some of them were but--
Speaker 1: Musicians and artists and writers?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's really the stereotype, the ones I met, and it was just a few, yeah, they had, they were like that, they were not noted, they, I remember visiting a couple of night clubs through, with these African Americans and these were night clubs they frequented, or whatever, and they were not musicians themselves, no, they just hung around other African Americans but they, they were just working there.  They were working class or not quite working class but maybe a little bit above it, that level, but they were not the artists of the 1940s and the 1950s, they were not that group of people, no, not at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So from that experience of traveling in Europe for about three months or so in 19--some in 1969, it was a very eye-opening experience and when I went to Yale [Law School, New Haven, Connecticut], my experiences in college [Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire] and that experience of traveling, had produced some different notions about who, what I should try to do, what I should try to accomplish with my law school career.
Story_ID: 253607
Speaker 1: What were your objectives at that point?  I mean, what did you, what was on your mind?
Speaker 2: Well, most law students, black and white, I think it's fair to say, were interested in corporate law, working for a major corporation and making a lot of money of some sort and some were, of course, interested in personal, public service, but in a traditional way.  I was not.  I had begun for, this was a continuation of my trying to think outside the box, so to speak.  In other words, Yale [Law School, New Haven, Connecticut] was the best so how, for me, how would I be able to go to the best and try to take advantage of what the best had to offer and to try to make it applicable in some way to the need for real social change in America.  How to do that.  I remember going to a contracts class, my first year of law school, and we were talking, the professor was talking about contract law and I read the course material in the textbook before class and the discussion was all about the traditional ways of looking at contracts and this type of thing and the relationship between the consumer and the producer and this type of thing, et cetera, and the contract relationship that comes out of that.  So I asked the professor, I said something like, this would be for the entire class, "Most of what you're saying don't, does not apply to a lot of what you're saying or you're now, so it doesn't apply to people who are outside of this parameter which you're discussing.  In other words, people who don't have the money to afford this kind of vehicle.  These are people who haven't reached this level and are not likely to reach this level of success in American society, so the amounts that you're talking about, the relationship between a consumer who has money to purchase this product and is well-read, has a contract before them, or whatever, that doesn't apply to them.  So, it's important to think of a framework, or begin to think of frameworks, that apply to mass of people who don't, who are not in this, these parameters that you're talking about.  This is for middle class people, for upper middle class people, et cetera, and so, let's focus on something that deals more specifically with their problems, their issues."  He dismissed it, out of hand, and the class was ready to jump on me.  There were snickers in the classroom, why was I even raising such a subject.  These people were not there to talk about the kind of issues I was talking about.  They were there to be trained in contract law, securities law and other kinds of subjects that would allow them to advance their careers, in a traditional way.  So what I was trying to bring up as a subject, it had no relevance to what was being discussed in class.  So that was a real eye-opener for me right from the beginning, but still it was important for me to do that searching, to try to figure out how this experience could, could help me try to find a way to make a difference in the lives of black people and move black people forward and as a result of that, the country as a whole forward, and I just saw that being a traditional lawyer wasn't going to do that.

Speaker 1: Were there any sympathetic law professors or students at the school?
Speaker 2: I don't recall a single one at Yale [Law School, New Haven, Connecticut].  Not a single one.  There was a black professor, a black dean--he was an associate dean.  He was very sympathetic to his students, us black students, but as far as the professors go, no, not at all.  They were very tradition-minded in every way, very demanding, which was fine, but one had to fit within the mold.
Speaker 1: Who was this black dean?
Speaker 2: His last name was Thomas.  A very nice man.  I think he may finally have retired this year or last year or something.  There was some type of celebration of his tenure at Yale but Dean [James A.] Thomas.  I can't remember his first name at the moment.
Speaker 1: So, what phase of the law did you concentrate on again?
Speaker 2: I just graduated.  No particular phase.  I liked constitutional law best and that was, and I liked, I took some subjects, international law.  I liked that as well.  International law and constitutional law was what, the subjects I paid most attention to, yes, and I liked the most.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, you finished in, was it--
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-four [1974].
Speaker 1: Seventy-four [1974], okay.
Speaker 2: I got my degree in 1974.
Story_ID: 253609
Speaker 1: Now you established a firm almost immediately, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You and another person named [John] Blakely [ph.], right?
Speaker 2: Right, in fact while I was at the school, some fellow students and I established our own law school association.  There was BALSA, which is still in existence, called the Black American Law Students Association [National Black Law Students Association (NBLSA)] that was established around that time, not at Yale [Law School, New Haven, Connecticut], but Yale had a chapter, and there were a group of us, however, who wanted to try to think outside the box and to the extent that we could, act outside the box.  Most of the students, almost every student at the school, wanted to follow the traditional pursuits as I just described earlier, and our interest was to say, look, if we're going to move our people forward, then how do we do it because what the Civil Rights Movement did was to create a black middle class in the United States.  Before the Civil Rights Movement, there were blacks, of course, who did well.  There were individual blacks who did well all across the country, like in Columbus, Georgia, there were a handful.  In Cincinnati [Ohio], there were more than a handful, there were a few more, and in Chicago [Illinois], there were even more but there was no real black middle class in the country.  The Civil Rights Movement did that.  It created a black middle class.  We can talk about what a middle class is or what a class is, maybe for another time or whatever, but still it created a black middle class whose interest don't always coincide with those of working class black people, or unemployed black people.  They no longer lived in the black community.  They're not just individual blacks who were forced to live along with the rest of us because of racism but they were blacks now who could afford to live wherever they wanted to live in the country and the laws had been relaxed enough, changed enough, to allow them to do that.  So their interest wasn't always consistent with the interest, even though they were raised blacks, part of the same race, and thus subject to racism like the rest of us which gave us ties across class, nonetheless the Civil Rights Movement for the first time created a class, a middle class, but it was small and it still is small compared to the vast numbers of our people who are not in the middle class and have no hope of getting there, given the way things are now.  So our question was, many, the few of us in law school thought like me, what do we do, how do we, what kind of things do we do to really begin to change things for our people and in doing so move the country forward?  So we formed our own little group called the Malcolm X Legal Studies Association [ph.], the Malcolm X Legal Studies Association.  We didn't want to be part of BALSA.  We supported BALSA, but we thought, look, BALSA is the traditional group pushing for traditional type remedies.  Well, let's think outside the box, let's act outside the box, so we created, a few students and I created, a Malcolm X Legal Studies Association.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we invited speakers to campus.  I'm not sure who, BALSA would invite some, we would invite some, just to get a, begin to try to give people a different perspective, a different view on things, et cetera.
Speaker 1: Who did you invite that you--
Speaker 2: Let's see who.  I don't, I can't remember exactly who, I can't remember any of the speakers we [Malcolm X Legal Studies Association (ph.)] invited.  I cannot, but I don't recall there being any prominent speakers but they were lawyers.  They were lawyers whose, well progressive lawyers.  We considered them progressives.  There were lawyers who worked in New York [New York].  There were a couple of people from Boston [Massachusetts].  They were not necessarily big name people but, because we didn't have the money like BALSA [Black American Law Students Association; National Black Law Students Association (NBLSA)] had.  BALSA was supported by the school [Yale Law School, New Haven, Connecticut] and they could invite prominent speakers but we invited others just to give students a different perspective on some of the things that were happening in the country.
Story_ID: 253610
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, now, when you graduated, now you formed, now before I get you out of law school, is that, is there another story from law school that, did you ever feel that you--
Speaker 2: Well you asked me about setting up a firm on leaving law school, that I did.  When I was in law school, I was working.  I set up a firm when I was in law school.  I set up this, a consultant firm when I was in law school because I found the law school work challenging but at the same time it didn't require that I, it wasn't so challenging that I didn't have free time, so I had enough free time to actually work.  So what I did was to establish a consulting firm while I was in law school and called it Bennett and Blakely [ph.].  It was a consulting firm.  What we did was to have one, a partner, a fellow law school student named John Blakely [ph.] and we set up a consulting firm to consult with local black businesses, which is very interesting because we didn't know anything about business ourselves but we pretended like we did.
Speaker 1: How did you get the nerve to do that?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, we knew that people would buy the notion of Yale Law School [New Haven, Connecticut].  The fact that you're Yale Law School, go to Yale Law School, you've got to be smart.  So I go to Yale Law School so I can help you with your business.  The guy says, "Yeah, maybe you can.  I didn't go to Yale Law School".  Well, okay, so that's the entree and one of our clients was this company called O'Sullivan's Fuel Oil Company [Inc.] and we were very successful in helping him expand his business.  It's very interesting, very, very interesting experience.  He became our main client, O'Sullivan's Fuel Oil.  It was run by a man by the name of Ken Barboza [Kenneth Barboza].  It was a major African American fuel oil distributor in New Haven [Connecticut], in the surrounding area.  There were two others.  There was one called Grimes [Oil Company] in Boston [Massachusetts], two others in the region, one called Grimes in Boston and one in New York [New York] called Wallace--Wallace & Wallace [Fuel Oil Company, Inc.], or something like, or just Wallace Fuel Oil.  The one in Wallace, the one in New York, Mr. [Charles] Wallace, his became the largest of the three in the New England region, but they were all benefitted from the 8(a), that is the set aside program.  This was the beginnings of that and we helped, me principally, helped Ken Barboza, the owner of O'Sullivan's Fuel Oil, get these contracts which enabled him to expand his business.  He did very well.  He became a millionaire.  Had, eventually, got season tickets for the New England Patriots football games.  He did extremely well and we were able to help him do that because we could do all of the paperwork, all of the government work and travel to Washington, D.C. with him, meet with government agencies for all this type of work, so it really, it really did work.  This was while I was in law school, not after I graduated.  It had took me out of the school, this kind of activity, this work, took me out of the school, into the community plus it gave me money.  I was already on scholarship but I was making money on my own and I was giving money to other students who needed money because I was making money as a consultant.

Speaker 1: And what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm a lawyer and also an international business consultant.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is a continuation of an interview we started about a month ago.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 253612
Speaker 1: What questions did Europeans ask you about being a black American in 1969?  Do you remember anything?
Speaker 2: At that time, of course there was great tumult in the United States.  There was, of course, still the ongoing civil rights struggle in a very big way and also increasingly so, demonstrations against the Vietnam War.
Speaker 1: Yes, it's the aftermath of [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.]'s assassination and the riots going down (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, exactly, and I was around a lot of students from the United States as well as from Europe since I was staying, I was a student myself, having finished [Dartmouth] College [Hanover, New Hampshire] and I'm on my way to [Yale] Law School [New Haven, Connecticut].  And so there were a lot of discussions about civil rights in the United States, the status of our people here in the United States, of course, and the general conditions in the United States overall because of the war.  And so there was a lot of discussions at the time about these issues and, of course, in London [England] there's Hyde Park Corner and there are lots and lots of speeches being made there about the Civil Rights Movement, assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, et cetera, and I would just go to these meetings and go to these speeches, to hear speeches at various places.  And so there was discussions, not just question, but just discussions about like I said, those primary issues, the Civil Rights Movement in the United States, status of black people in the States and also the Vietnam War.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you get a chance to meet the, other African communities in these countries?
Speaker 2: Yes I did, yes I did.  Where I stayed was the cheapest places, of course, in terms of money and other students stayed there, too, from everywhere.  So I got to meet, got to meet, had the opportunity to meet people from all over the world which was a very interesting, students from all over the world, which was a very interesting experience for me, traveling in Europe as I did.
Story_ID: 253613
Speaker 1: I just wondered about the communities like in, in England, you've got like big black communities in Tottenham [London, England] and other places, you know, where people--
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was--
Speaker 1: Did you get a chance to go into those communities?
Speaker 2: Yes I did.  In fact I got my haircut cut in, in the black communities in London [England] and sure, which was a very interesting experience for me.  It's the first time I'd ever traveled outside the United States and, of course, in addition to Africans, lots of Africans living in London, there were also lots of Caribbean blacks, black from, throughout the Caribbean, English-speaking Caribbean, who lived in London as well.  So that was my first introduction to those communities, too, very interesting.
Speaker 1: Yes, I thought because a lot of us don't think about these black communities in these other, in France or, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: They're, they're all over, though.
Speaker 2: They're all over and, of course, in large part, being there as a result of their colonial history, of course, the British colonized much of the Caribbean and, of course, Britain being the metropolitan country, so to speak, the key capitol of their empire, people travel there from the Caribbean, from the English-speaking or British ruled African countries for jobs, for education, et cetera and then many just stayed there for a long period of time.
Story_ID: 253614
Speaker 1: Do you think it was better that you went to Europe first and got in touch with these communities before you actually went to Africa or do you think it would have made any difference?
Speaker 2: I think it was better that I did that.  First of all, couldn't afford to go to Africa so I had no choice but to go to Europe since I was really interested in traveling and Europe was accessible and, of course, it was made accessible because, of course, the general market was white American students and it just so happened that I was in an environment that in which I was exposed to these same opportunities and it was very good for me because, of course, I am an American and it was very, very interesting to see the homeland of white Americans, that is, places from which they come, Britain, Germany, Sweden, for example, and, of course, our country was founded by these people as well as African peoples.  And so it was fascinating to see places that I'd always read about and it gave me a really good, a much better understanding of our country's history, seeing these countries and seeing how well developed they, they were in relationship to the countries that I were to see later that were very poor, of course, in terms of material conditions and, et cetera.  So it was a very good context and I was very appreciative of that and, of course, on the very first trip, my first visit to Africa, the continent, was to North Africa and, of course, there were a lot of blacks there as well and that surprised me, too, throughout Tunisia.  In fact, as I was hitchhiking, I stayed with blacks in Tunisia and also in Algeria.  So it was quite an interesting experience to see black people in all of these different places, Spain, Portugal, Lisbon [Portugal], many blacks, of course, from the Portuguese-speaking African countries.  So it was a fascinating experience, no question about it.
Story_ID: 253615
Speaker 1: Were they better off than African Americans do you think or were they, you know, in a similar situation?
Speaker 2: I wouldn't say they were better off than us.  There were similar situations since that, of course, they were, actually in many instances, much worse off materially than we because, of course, our country is, is so rich, so wealthy, so our people, the African American people, by virtue of the fact we are Americans and participate in the economy here in a significant way, obviously, we have much more disposable income.  We have much more material wealth than any other African people around the world and, of course, we've been here since the founding of the country and have played a very integral role in the history of the country at every stage.  So that's different from African communities, expatriate African communities living in these European capitals, Lisbon [Portugal], Rome [Italy], for example, London [England], Madrid [Spain].  That's a different, different context all together.
Speaker 1: So are you saying that a lot of these communities were communities of non-citizens living in a foreign country?
Speaker 2: Yes, and many of them are non-citizens and some citizens, of course, but their role is, in those countries, is very different from ours here.  I mean, we're truly integrated into the country in terms of being Americans, there's no question about it.  That's not to say that there's not racial discrimination, obviously there is, but still we play a very integral role in the country and significantly so and whether it's acknowledged or not, it's--history bears it out and we always have.
Story_ID: 253616
Speaker 1: Did you see any of the same kind of discrimination in--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  In fact, I remember being in Lisbon [Portugal] and there was, this is Portugal, capital of Portugal, and at that time the Portuguese were fighting, or blacks in Mozambique, Angola, Guinea-Bissau, were fighting the Portuguese seeking liberation of these countries and I was there.  I remember when a large troopship, ship transporting Portuguese soldiers to these African colonies and that was very interesting and I happened to be with some Mozambican and Angolan students who were studying in Portugal and we were watching these soldiers go up the gangplank to these ships, the ship, and it was very interesting, very interesting discussion.  So, and we talked about the discrimination which they face and the obvious discrimination in their homeland and oppression in the homeland.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Angola and Mozambique had, I knew there was a lot of publicity in the '70s [1970s] about the, exposing the atrocities committed by the Portuguese soldiers.
Speaker 2: Yeah, very much so.
Speaker 1: Yeah, in Jet magazine even carried a photo of a Portuguese soldier holding up the head of an Angolan.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And they, you know, and it was a--
Speaker 2: Yeah, very brutal history.
Speaker 1: --and a boycott Gulf [Oil], I think it was.
Speaker 2: Yeah, very brutal history, no question about it.  Eventually, of course, in later years, I traveled to these countries a number of times, that is Mozambique and, never to Angola, but Mozambique, very interesting experience.
Story_ID: 253617
Speaker 1: Did you find much evidence of the influence of African Americans on Europe?
Speaker 2: Yes, very much so.  Of course our country as a whole, being so preeminent in the world in so many ways, not only economically but culture, popular culture, and the African American people are obviously and have been for a long time, a driving force of American popular culture.  So just as it is today that American rap music is popular throughout the world and gaining more and more influence throughout the world which it originated with African American people who drive it here, at that time, it was obvious, too, that African American culture had a major impact in Europe.  I mean, obviously, jazz music was quite prevalent in some sectors of European society, et cetera and I saw that in France.  I saw that in Paris [France].  I saw that in London [England], et cetera, there's just no question, so certainly that, and then also, also I would say with the Civil Rights Movement, as well, that was, obviously, a push for change within the system from people struggling on the bottom, so to speak, and that was an inspiration for mass movements in Europe as well.  You may recall it in 1968, there were big student movement throughout Europe, largely inspired by African American student movement and white American student movements and combined here in the United States in the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Was it surprising?  Did it surprise you at that time to see so much influence, so much African American influence in Europe?
Speaker 2: Well I had read about it but to actually see influence there, yeah, it really did, just like having read about these places that I visited in Europe for the first time, I read about them for so many years, and then to actually see them, yeah, it makes it more real.
Story_ID: 253618
Speaker 1: Did you get the impression that Europeans were sympathetic to the African American cause over here or did they feel that, I mean, or did they have mixed feelings about it?
Speaker 2: I didn't, I wouldn't say that Europeans as a whole have that kind of sympathy, so to speak.  Sure there's sectors of the European society, or the European peoples, depending on where one is and, to whom one is conversing, but as a whole, no, because their histories, most of them have a similar history with black peoples because they were colonizers, too.  And so even though a lot of people will say, "Oh, Europe is a lot more liberal", I don't think it's necessarily so.  I don't believe it because they're, in fact history shows that there are so many similarities between their history and our history here.  Just fewer black people live in their countries but sure black people do live there.
Speaker 1: That's interesting (laughter), that's an interesting perspective because I, you know, it doesn't mean you hear a lot of talk from people that go there about how liberal it is or--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, and I've traveled to Europe.  I must have traveled to Europe, I would say more than a hundred times in my lifetime.  I've been to Europe many, many times and I've heard, of course heard that story about the French being so liberal and black people finding it much easier in France and perhaps our musicians in the 1940s and 1950s did so, but as a whole, French have a very brutal colonial history in Africa and in Algeria as well.  So, I mean, an awful history.  So where does this liberal tendency come from?  The history doesn't suggest that at all, but there are many French people, obviously, who are as sympathetic and as supportive of the struggles of African peoples around the world, including African Americans, as there are white Americans who are supportive.  So there's no question that some people, but as a whole, I wouldn't say that Europe is a liberal bastion for the support of African peoples around the world, no.
Speaker 1: So, okay, all right, well let's move on then to--those are good, you know, I think it's a good, some good information there about that.
Speaker 2: That's something I learned while traveling and reading because there was a popular perception, that yeah, Europe is a lot better and a lot different or whatever.  I don't think so, no.
Story_ID: 253619
Speaker 1: I think we talked about your law school experience, too, last time.  When you came back, you went to Yale [Law School, New Haven, Connecticut] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I went to Yale Law School.
Speaker 1: Yale Law School.
Speaker 2: My first trip back I think I had twenty-five cents left for when I arrived in New York [New York] from my five hundred dollars.  I had twenty-five cents left and, in fact a very interesting, well this was in 1970 when I traveled to Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa for the first time that, I'll talk about that when we get to it but at any rate I had twenty-five cents left and I had to get from New York to New Haven [Connecticut] to start school so I hitchhiked to get there because I didn't have money to take the bus or any other transportation so I just hitchhiked to New Haven from New York.
Speaker 1: Well those are the days of people actually still could hitchhike.  I don't know if they're still doing it these days but--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I don't know either but I certainly did.  With so little money and the airfare at the time being very expensive, it was not the kind of, the air transportation at the time was not so mass-based at the time that it was accessible to people who rode the bus, like me, Greyhound [Lines] and Trailways [Transportation System].  Of course it is accessible now because, and had been for quite some years because the fares are very low but at that time, travel from New York to Chicago [Illinois] was five hundred and some dollars and I, just no way I could afford anything like that so I took the bus and hitchhiked.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I didn't have the bus fare, I would just hitchhike.  It'd take forever, but I would still make it.
Story_ID: 253620
Speaker 1: Is there any like one outstanding experience in law school that stands out?  I think you mentioned you didn't really have any mentors in law school or anything like that?
Speaker 2: Having a what now?
Speaker 1: Any mentors or such.
Speaker 2: No, I didn't have any mentors in law school.  I think for me the most salient memory of law school, of Yale Law School [New Haven, Connecticut] in particular, since that's where I attended, is how most of the students were so keen on fulfilling personal ambition meaning becoming significant players in the, in the system so to speak, in the establishment.  I looked at law as a way of bringing about change in the system, the way people lived, the way people had access to opportunities, et cetera, but the students on the whole, attending Yale Law School, did not see things that way.  They wanted to be people who actually ran the government, people who actually, at a very high level, people who actually ran businesses in the United States and were significant players in the legal community.  So, that was a, it was a conservative place not so much in the sense that it was a red-baiting type institution.  It wasn't that.  It was a lot more sophisticated than that but at the same time it was not, it was liberal, no question about it but again, like I said, to me the most, one of the things, the memories I have about it is that the students really were on the whole, driven towards being a real significant part of what was already here, the established system, as opposed to really driving to change it.
Speaker 1: Did you, did it sort of highlight the differences in how, you know, black people and, I guess certain classes, only a certain class of white people that maybe that aspire like that, I don't know, but did you, did you notice a difference in the background of the individual and what they were (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, sure.  Well these were people who, by and large, these students were people who were part of the elite already in the country.  Now they came from families that were part of the elite.  There were many of them like me, Ivy League graduates, but I wasn't part of any elite obviously, but still, except I was at Yale so that was an elite in itself but still, I was not part of the elite families in the United States, the elite communities, the elite social systems in the--I was not part of that.  So there was a big difference between my background and the background of the vast majority of the students there and it was evident in the way we approached our coursework as well.  There's some blacks, had the same kind of ambition as most of the white students did but it was obvious that it would be more difficult for us to pursue those ambitions, those path than it would our fellow white students.  And we were just as capable as them, obviously, but career paths were obviously going to be different and they were different.
Story_ID: 253621
Speaker 1: What was the percentage of black students there, do you remember?
Speaker 2: Well, on the whole, black students were activists.  There were two black student organizations that were most prominent.  One was, Black American Law Students Association [(BALSA); National Black Law Students Association (NBLSA)] which was just getting started nationwide at that time.  I started law school in 1969.  BALSA may have been started, what, founded in 1968 or something like that, or so, so that was that organization there.  Then there was a Malcolm X Legal Studies Association [ph.] of which I was a part, as well as being a member of BALSA and the Malcolm X Legal Studies Association, I founded with some other African American students at Yale [Law School, New Haven, Connecticut] and we were a little more, I would say, a bit more progressive in terms of our look.
Speaker 1: Okay, so were the, did you, did the white students that weren't, were there any white students there that weren't part of the power elite that?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, no question.
Speaker 1: Did they have the same aspirations as the, as the--
Speaker 2: No, no, there's no question about it.  No, there were, there were some who obviously didn't just want to fit the mold, the existing mold, as well, sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No question about it.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, so what do you think was the percentage of black students in the, I know you're a minority there at Yale Law School, but how many students were there all together and how many black students?
Speaker 2: Yale was ranked at the time as the number one school, law school in the country, it still is today and one of the reason it had such high ranking is that it is extremely selective in the students.  It has about six hundred students.  It had about, maybe, six hundred students total in the student body at the time.  Harvard [Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], for example, had a student body of three times as many and I was accepted to attend Harvard Law School but I choose Yale because there, it was more selective even, and the number of black students there, I don't recall, but there must have been about maybe three, four percent or something like that, maybe, maybe twenty-five of us or something, thirty at most, I would say, but I don't recall, maybe, it could have been much less, I don't know, but there were very few of us, obviously.
Story_ID: 253622
Speaker 1: Anything else about law school that you--
Speaker 2: I liked it because it was, it required great discipline at the school to succeed there, to get through the school.  It was very demanding and the students worked very hard.  I really, I appreciated that, too.  It gave me an insight, as was my college [Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire] experience, the same.  People who make it here, work hard.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And this was people who had advantages that most Americans don't have and by and large they worked very hard and that was a very interesting experience for me, in both college and law school.
Speaker 1: Okay, was it tougher than you thought it was going to be?
Speaker 2: Yes, I think so, maybe, yes, because competition was stiffer, a little narrower, competitive level or a narrow range for competition.  I mean, when professors, for example, graded on a curve, well if everybody is an A student coming from the top schools and colleges in the country, then an A at Yale [Law School, New Haven, Connecticut] is, I mean, a C at Yale Law School, we didn't have grades that time, such as A, B, C, D and F, we had pass-fail, which made it easier but still it was very, very competitive.  A good experience for, later years for me.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so, was there a time when you thought you might not make it?
Speaker 2: No, I never, I didn't have any problems at the school, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Academically, no, not at all, no, I had no kind of problems there, no.
Speaker 1: Okay. Did the black students study together?
Speaker 2: There were some who did, yeah.  There were some who did.  We helped each other.  There were a couple of students, for example, I helped, yeah, we did, but then again, there was competition among us, too, and some guys wouldn't participate, wouldn't help at all.  I mean, if we missed one, if I missed a lecture or something like that, and I remember once I was traveling in Europe during the spring break one year and I didn't get back for the first week of class, this was in '72 [1972], my senior year, and a guy I had known from my years at Dartmouth [College, Hanover, New Hampshire], he was a classmate of mine at Yale, he wouldn't even share his notes with me from the first week of class and I had been traveling abroad just for the experience of traveling still during spring break.  I had a few dollars and I liked to travel so, but this guy wouldn't even share.
Speaker 1: That's, and you hear those stories about, you know, Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] and Yale Law School and the big law schools and the students sabotaging of the, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, there were students like that, no question, no question, an extremely competitive place, no question about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: People really wanted to succeed, meaning they really wanted to see their names in high positions here in the United States and Yale Law School was a great entree for that that was open to one graduating student from there because Yale has that kind of reputation.
Story_ID: 253623
Speaker 1: What were your prospects at graduation?
Speaker 2: Well, I did not want to go the established route.  I did not want to be a lawyer in a major law firm.  I eventually did do that but at graduating I did not.  I wanted to have my own business, which I did while I was in law school.  This was a consulting firm which I established to help African American businesses in the New Haven [Connecticut] area.  After, from the beginning of my Yale Law School [New Haven, Connecticut] experience, I lived off-campus and, in other words, I lived in an African American community in New Haven and I just, I had a little three hundred dollar car so I drove to school, that's an interesting experience, how I got the car, but anyway, I drove to the campus but I lived in the African American community all my three years there.  So I got to know people in the community, it was relatively small, and I got to know the business people and I would help them with various legal issues that they had and after a while a classmate and I, a classmate of mine, established a consulting firm called Bennett and Blakely [ph.], while we were in law school.  So we were making a little money.  So I wanted to continue that--
Speaker 1: Sort of as lawyers but not quite as lawyers?
Speaker 2: Right, you're right, we weren't, we couldn't hold ourselves out as lawyers, of course, but people came to us because, business people came to us because, well we were more educated than they did and we knew more about legal matters than they did, generally, and we'd charge a little money.  So, that's what I wanted to do after I finished law school.  I didn't want to follow the established route, so I did that for a while.
Story_ID: 253624
Speaker 1: You had your consultancy [Bennett and Blakely (ph.)] established--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --you know, even before you got your law degree [from Yale Law School, New Haven, Connecticut].
Speaker 2: Right, and, right, and I made enough money to make a living for a little while.
Speaker 1: Okay, but in 1972, you went to Ghana.  Can you tell us about that?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Or am I jumping ahead?
Speaker 2: Well in 1970, I traveled to Sub-Saharan Africa for the first time.  I hitchhiked through Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Burundi and Rwanda.
Speaker 1: Now those were hot places in those days (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Very much so, right, very much so and to hitchhike through Rwanda and, of course in Rwanda, at that time, there was still this, obviously this tremendous conflict between the Hutu and the Tutsi which, of course, culminated most recently in this [Rwandan] genocide, but there had been these ethnic clashes since 1959.
Speaker 1: There were stories, yeah there were stories going on I know when I was in college I read about the Hutus and the Tutsi--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Mass murder, genocide going on and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, before I got there--
Speaker 1: Yeah, so much so I think the Hutus were cutting off the Tutsi at the knees with machetes and the Tutsi were using nails to kill Hutus to save bullets by driving nails in their heads and stuff.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: That was going on in the early '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: Yes it was.
Speaker 1: Before 1994 it was big--
Speaker 2: Yes, long before '94 [1994] and that was a most interesting experience for me.  And then also in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, I met the African National Congress [ANC] for the first time.  Their leadership, much of their leadership was in exile in Dar es Salaam and I spent a month there and not a whole lot to do except for me since this was my interest hanging around the African National Congress leadership.  So I met a number of their people who became government officials in the first post-apartheid government, free government, [Nelson] Mandela's cabinet, et cetera and that started me off in terms of having strong personal contact with leadership of the African, African Congress.  That took place in Dar es Salaam in 1970.  So that was an interesting experience.  So hitchhiking throughout East Africa was, was a very good learning experience for me.
Story_ID: 253625
Speaker 1: Why did you go to East Africa first?  Was there a reason?
Speaker 2: I saw again on a bulletin board at Yale Law School [New Haven, Connecticut] cheap flights advertised.  Cheap flights advertised for Nairobi [Kenya], New York [New York], London [England], Nairobi and Istanbul, Turkey.  So I went to Turkey, too, and I stayed there for ten days in Turkey.  I would not have gone to Turkey except that that was part of the itinerary.  So that roundtrip ticket cost, I don't remember what it was, but less than three hundred dollars.  At that time, a student could travel like that on these airlines nobody ever heard of before new airlines and so what, you took your chances, they were not major airlines, obviously, but there were these, for me, affordable flights, three hundred something dollars and I was able to travel from New York to London, then London to Nairobi, spent three months in Nairobi, in East Africa, hitchhiking through, around East Africa and then spent a final ten days in Istanbul, Turkey.
Speaker 1: Now, now did you meet any of the American expatriates in Tanzania?  There was a--
Speaker 2: Oh, met many of them.
Speaker 1: --big group there.
Speaker 2: Many of them.  It was very interesting.
Speaker 1: Ex-civil rights workers.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Bob Moses, I think was there.
Speaker 2: I did not meet Bob Moses but I met a number of people who were, I don't recall meeting any famous or prominent people but I met a number of African Americans who were just everyday working people, some who were living off their social security income from the United States, which went a long ways in Africa, of course.  There were people from Chicago [Illinois].  I remember meeting this one man who was from Chicago and he had a social security check coming from the United States to Dar es Salaam [Tanzania] and this was, allowed him to live very, very well and he spent a lot of time hanging around, he was retired, spent a lot of time hanging around other African Americans.  I met quite a number of African Americans living in Tanzania at the time.  Of course, Tanzania at the time was a haven, so to speak, a mecca, I guess one could say, for African Americans who were disenchanted politically with what was going on, happening in the United States.
Speaker 1: Right, I think it was due to the President [Julius] Nyerere, I think, or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, President Nyerere, Julius Nyerere of Tanzania who was very open to our being there, had a very strong Pan-Africanist spirit and so it was a welcoming place and it still is very welcoming.  I was just in Tanzania a few months ago and very much so.
Story_ID: 253626
Speaker 1: Did you catch an inkling of the tension in Rwanda and Burundi (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't, maybe it's good that I didn't because I was just hitchhiking and couldn't tell any difference between Hutu and Tutsi, absolutely none whatsoever.  In fact, the gentleman I stayed with in Kigali [Rwanda], I, he had, I was hitchhiking and he just picked me up and took me to his home and I stayed with this gentleman and his wife.  His wife was Tutsi, he was Hutu, I couldn't, I mean, if you had said to me that he was Tutsi and she was Hutu, I couldn't have told the difference, whatsoever, but it was an interesting place because there were these tensions and I didn't, I didn't sense it myself, everybody was friendly to me.  I think they clearly saw me as a foreigner and I just, like I said, riding in an open truck, in some cases through the hills of Burundi, Burundi as well as Rwanda at night and, of course, these same tensions exist in Burundi.  So it was a very interesting experience, no question about it.
Speaker 1: Now Kenya is one of the, number one tourist attractions in the world because of the animals and so forth and the development, I guess, and I guess the highlands that people, the people live in that the Europeans like in Kenya.  What was your impression of Kenya?  Did you have--
Speaker 2: Well it was the most developed.  Nairobi [Kenya] was obviously the most developed city in East Africa, very well developed.  I mean, of course, served the interest of whites primarily.  Those are the ones who obviously lived well, and the African elite lived well also.  And at that time there was the East African Community which was a very interesting organization established by the British to provide for transportation and community, communication infrastructure for East Africa as a whole which worked very well.  There was a railway system, a bus system, a telephone system, whereby one could travel and communicate through Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, very easily, and very inexpensively.  For example, I took a bus from Nairobi to Mombasa [Kenya].  This was an East African Community's bus.  I took a train from Mombasa to Arusha [Tanzania] which was an East African Railways [and Harbours Corporation] and these systems, transportation systems, operated throughout these three countries.
Story_ID: 253627
Speaker 1: Idi Amin came to power in Uganda, not too many months after I left there, and came to power in 1970 (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, well, [Milton] Obote was president when you were there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Milton Obote was president at the time but Amin came to power, I think, a few months after I had left in August or so, I don't remember exactly when, but just the same, that was the story that the East African Community was destroyed.  So, Kenya was the crown jewel, so to speak, of that East African Community.  So, the roads were well-maintained, the principal roads were well-maintained, the facilities were very good throughout East Africa.  That has changed, obviously, a lot over the last thirty years but, yes, of course I traveled through the areas where whites had these great farms and one of the things I noticed about Africa and where the whites lived, there are fences on the land, border, setting land boundaries, or ownership boundaries and generally one doesn't see that where there are not whites like in West Africa and Ghana, for example, you don't see land demarcated with barbed wire or the fences, but in Kenya one does.  And there are vast stretches of just land that's fenced off, just, just absolutely stunning, estates owned by whites, and still exist today.
Speaker 2: Okay, so and you went to Ghana in '72 [1972], right?  That was right after--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was seventy--I think that was '71 [1971], '72 [1972], I'm not sure exactly when.  That was my first trip to West Africa.
Speaker 2: Seventy-four [1974], I'm sorry, '74 [1974], was Ghana.
Speaker 1: It may have been '72 [1972], I don't remember exactly what year.
Speaker 2: I see it on this.
Speaker 1: Seventy-four [1974], okay.
Speaker 2: On this outline it says '74 [1974], right.
Speaker 1: Seventy-four [1974].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I think I went a year or two before on some other, that may just deal with business, that resume that you're referring to, but I had traveled there before.
Story_ID: 253628
Speaker 1: Tell us about your first trip to West Africa.
Speaker 2: Well it's very interesting because, it was in the early '70s [1970s], as well.  West Africa is very different from East Africa and it's also very different from South Africa--southern Africa, and one of the most immediate differences one notices is the teeming populations, meaning, lots and lots of people.  It's much more densely populated, West Africa is, Ghana, Nigeria, for example, than East Africa is.  A lot more space, fewer people in East Africa, wide open spaces in East Africa, but in Ghana, West Africa, man, there are lots of people everywhere.  So that was an immediate impression.  Also the major cities were, the infrastructure was not as well-developed as East Africa, it was obvious.  The capital cities had much less to offer in terms of building structures, the number of building structures, the modernity of the building structures, so that one notices that right away.  The people were just as friendly.  So those were things that, that struck me most, most immediate.
Speaker 1: Did you feel, most African Americans are, have a West African, you know, root, roots, anyways, have West African roots.  Did you feel any, did you feel particularly, you know, closer to West Africa than East Africa or it didn't make any difference?
Speaker 2: No, I don't because, and the reason I don't is because the slave trade, or the exploitation of our people in the slave business, was extensive in Africa throughout Africa.  I remember visiting a place in Tanzania, a town in Tanzania called Bagamoyo [Tanzania], "crush my heart," it's called, and that's referenced to the suffering that African peoples who were caught up in this slave trade suffered.  So I didn't feel any more affinity for West Africa than East Africa because I know that millions of our people are from Central Africa, millions of our people are from, from South Africa--from Southern Africa, East Coast of South Africa in the Zulu areas, for example.  Mozambique, heavy slave trade there, heavy slave trade in Kenya, heavy slave trade in Tanzania, Zanzibar was a big slave market, et cetera, that's, those countries are in East Africa and of course throughout West Africa, South, Southwest Africa, Angola, millions of people were exported from Angola, millions of people were exported from the Congo [Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)], so who's to say there are more of us specifically from what is now Nigeria or Ghana as opposed to Angola or Mozambique.  So I feel a strong affinity for all of Africa and we look like people, our people here look just like people in East Africa, as much as we do in West Africa.  When one travels to these countries, as much as I have, you see that quite easily.  It's just at a, probably more of our people came through West Africa because it's closest to the countries that we were exported to.  South America, for example, much, much closer than say Mozambique or Kenya, but we're from all those countries, all those what, all of Africa.
Story_ID: 253629
Speaker 1: Did you feel different traveling in Sub-Saharan Africa because it's a first you say, from your first trip, did you notice a difference?  Now, you'd been to Europe and you visited African communities, but this might be the first time, was this the first time that you'd been in a country where the majority of the people were black?
Speaker 2: Yes it was, it was quite a different experience for me than traveling in Europe, obviously, and quite a different experience in traveling in North Africa and the main reason for that, obviously, this was clearly home, ancestral home.  This was clearly my people and there was clearly, obviously, an affinity between, strong, strong affinity between me and them and them and me, that was very obvious, that's not to say everybody in Africa, everybody in the countries I had traveled to over there embraced me, welcomed me home, whatever, that's not the case, but it was obvious that we were one people, ancestrally so, that was very clear to me, right from the beginning.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was there anything that really puzzled you about that experience that was surprising that you didn't really expect?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think that surprised me, that kind of an affinity which we have because there are so many myths that exist about us and them, just like there's this myth about black people being so well-received by Europeans, Europeans being so much more liberal than our fellow whites here in America, et cetera, that's a myth.  It's also a myth, very much so, that's propagated quite heavily that Africans don't like us and that we're not welcome, that's, that's definitely not the case, not at all.  In fact, there was an article about a year and a half ago published in The Wall Street Journal saying that Ghanaians don't like African Americans and that was really, it was an affront to not just Ghanaians but also an affront to us, African Americans and an affront to us as a people, all of us Americans.  It's just simply not true, an absolute lie, the front page of The Wall Street Journal, subsequently published in other newspapers as well.
Story_ID: 253630
Speaker 1: Now this is, this is a pervasive rhetoric that has been going on for, at least since the turn of the century, that there's this attitude among certain African Americans that say, "I haven't lost anything in Africa," you know, "I don't want to be associated with Africa."  There's that rhetoric that's appeared in the newspapers like the [Chicago] Defender and other newspapers from way back at the turn of the century--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, sure, right.
Speaker 1: --couldn't go on forward but there's also like, there are also people who have always tried to make that connection, but did--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --so you think that the negative is, in fact there's a book published, I think, just a couple of years ago and the author was on 'The Today Show,' ['Today'] I think it was Larry Elder, I think, who went to Africa and came back saying, "I," you know, "there's nothing there."  I don't want to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I remember, I think I remember that particular book but that's not the only one like that.  There's a genre like that, of course, of books or by African Americans, condemn Africa and try to disassociate themselves from it but the march of history is something altogether different and regardless of what those of us as individuals may want or not want, still there's factors, forces in history, that are much stronger than individuals and this is one.  The relationship between African Americans and other African peoples in the Western Hemisphere and elsewhere in the world and those of our people on the continent, it's a relationship that will continue to grow stronger, it will continue to grow, it'll grow stronger, and it'll become much more evident in our lives here in America and elsewhere outside of Africa and in Africa as well, that's my view, and it's always been a part of our existence here in the United States, it will continue to be so, that's not to say that we're going back to live in Africa.  We are Americans.  We are very proud to be Americans.  We love our country but at the same time we're not just Americans, we're African people, too, we're African Americans and even though Africa is on the bottom in almost every category that one can measure, anything, nonetheless these are our people and we're one and that will continue to manifest itself in a positive way for our country here in the United States, very, very positive as that relationship builds.  It will manifest itself in more self-esteem, more accomplishment of our people here in the United States and also that kind of impact, that self-esteem, that more productive thrust on our part here in the United States, the African peoples here, the black American people, it'll have a more positive impact on our country as a whole, without question.
Story_ID: 253631
Speaker 1: Your career has been mostly as a consultant and, to business ventures in Africa and to political matters in Africa, when did you first develop a sense of mission around this?  I mean, you were, you have, you've had a love of travel since you were a kid, you know, but, but when did you first, or did you, was there a time when you felt that this was like a, more than just vacation or travel and there was some mission attached?
Speaker 2: Right, well, it's not so much a love of travel, it's a love for learning and travel is a way to learn, so I don't like to travel so much, although I do travel quite a bit, it's that I was always interested in knowing more about what was happening in the world.  It's so easy to live here in the United States and have a very narrow outlook on the world, a very provincial outlook on the world.  It may be fair to say that notwithstanding all this news media coverage that we have in the United States, Americans are generally a very provincial-minded, very narrow minded people in large part because Americans don't travel outside of the United States except when those who do travel, travel outside the United States, they travel to Europe or they'll travel to resorts and places like Thailand and the wintertime here, is a beautiful place to go in Thailand and elsewhere and South Asia where the tsunami just struck recently, these were people vacationing, but to travel to see the world, to learn the world, Americans don't generally do that and for me, it has been an eye-opening experience, a tremendous learning experience.  So that's why I wanted to travel.  It wasn't so much enjoyable in a sense that I was living a life of luxury because that's, wasn't the case when I first started but it was a truly eye-opening experience when I did travel to see the places, to meet people and to live at the level that I did because I was meeting very ordinary, very working people and I saw, for example, that I wasn't, it took me out of, the travel took me out, and traveling to Africa, took me out of the narrow world in which I had lived as an African American, a successful one as a student, obviously, and one with great potential as a graduate of Dartmouth College [Hanover, New Hampshire] and of Yale Law School [New Haven, Connecticut], but at the same time, it was a very narrow world, and this world of travel for me, and particularly to Africa, it opened up a much different world and I've traveled other than just to Africa, obviously, and to Europe.  I've traveled elsewhere in the world as well, but just the same, one thing led to another since I didn't want to just follow the path that was generally laid out for students here, graduating from these schools.
Story_ID: 253632
Speaker 1: As I said earlier, I had my own consulting firm [Bennett and Blakely (ph.)] while I was in law school [Yale Law School, New Haven, Connecticut].  I started business in Ghana, a housing business, constructing, well the first business I started in Ghana was making furniture in Nigeria.  We had, I had a Ghanaian partner and a Nigerian partner.  This was in 1974, actually.  You may recall the FESTAC ['77] the festival, the world African cultural festival [Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture] that was held in [Lagos] Nigeria in 1974.  Well, the Nigerian Civil War had ended in 1970, there was a lot of oil money there, of course, at the time and Nigeria was booming and the Nigerian government was going to host this world festival in 1974, I think it was.
Speaker 2: Well, it was finally held in '77 [1977].  I know they started talking about it in '74 [1974]--
Speaker 1: There was one in, okay--
Speaker 2: --but, but '77 [1977] was the big festival.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, there was a lot of infrastructure built for that festival, around the festival.  New roads, highways, housing, lots of new housing, apartment buildings, et cetera and I had a Nigerian partner and a Ghanaian partner, and we built houses for the FESTAC village [Lagos, Nigeria] for the festival, housing that was built.  So that was the first business that I was engaged in in Africa.  It was a business in Nigeria and then later building houses in Ghana.  And as I did this, I became experienced with how to do business there, meaning making contacts with people, learning the systems, the established government systems and peoples in both, in West African countries, et cetera.  And so this was a part of my business but it was not the primary part of my business.  I've always been a lawyer here, generally in Chicago [Illinois], practicing corporate law for the most part, but a significant part of my business, and at times depending on what projects I have, the major part of what I'm doing, or income, has been the international business so, but both, I've always done both.
Story_ID: 253633
Speaker 1: FESTAC ['77; Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture, Lagos, Nigeria] was a, I know, there's a lot of money spent on (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --FESTAC for the village [Lagos, Nigeria] and those that went over, the artists from Chicago [Illinois], talked about how they stayed in some, some really nice facilities.  I mean, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so I suppose, are these still, are people still living in these facilities?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they, the structures themselves exist, they're not as nice as they were and the highways are not as, because they simply were not maintained properly, but I built furniture for those.  My company, we built furniture for those institutions, those structures, or those, that housing, right there on site and what I did was through money which I made here, bought carpentry equipment and materials and sent it to Nigeria and later Ghana bought equipment for building houses and then also major vehicle, dump truck, which we needed to transport raw materials and things like that and shipped it from Chicago to Ghana.  So, but generally those facilities have not been, they were not been maintained and so they look pretty bad now.
Speaker 1: That's, in those days though, I mean, they were luxurious, almost in those days--
Speaker 2: They're beautiful.
Speaker 1: --it caused some people to wonder, you know, why does the Nigerian government spend this much money just for this event, you know.  Is there some kind of a long-term goal of development that they're going to, so apparently they didn't follow, I mean, with all the, I guess the changes, they haven't followed up on trying to--
Speaker 2: Right, well, the government has been very unstable over the years and a great deal of corruption in Nigeria, of course.  Monies that should have been used to maintain the highways, maintain the Murtala Muhammed [International] Airport [Nigeria].  I remember when it was first built I was there when it was opened and, gee whiz, it looks, I mean it's embarrassing for the Nigerians to have that structure now and it doesn't, it's not fully operational, it's--it needed paint, it's in need of basic, basic infrastructure for an airport.  I mean, like I said earlier, it's an embarrassment and this was built and commissioned in, for opening in 1976 and I remember that very well, beautiful, beautiful structure, beautiful design, beautiful structure all around.
Story_ID: 253634
Speaker 1: Well what else?  I mean, now you've been involved in several business ventures in Africa, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I've been involved in a number of, some major business projects in Africa.  One is the, probably the most significant one is the West African Gas Pipeline project.  This was a project that the major oil companies in Nigeria wanted to build to accomplish several objectives.  One, of course, to make money by selling natural gas that comes from the oil fields and gas fields in Nigeria, to West African countries, that's one.  A second objective is that the gas has been flared, or burned off, for many, many years.  There's been a lot of complaints about that from environmental groups around the world that this causes a great pollution to our atmosphere, world atmosphere, and so the big oil companies wanted to find an alternative to flaring this gas which is, obviously, wasteful, this gas, natural gas, obviously is a product that's heavily used around the world for a lot of very productive purposes.  And a third mission, of course, is that by using this gas, the West African countries could begin to use a tremendous resource to boost their economies, to, to speed the development of their economies because it's a much cheaper source for fuel and energy needs than is oil.  Back in nineteen ninety--1995, the Ghanaian government asked me, approached me and asked me if I would consider being honorary consul general for Ghana.  I didn't fully know what they wanted me to do.  I made, of course, full inquiries as to what they wanted me to do and they asked me if I would promote the country for business here in the United States.  So, they said to me that they would give me access to all of their top officials, including the president, for the promotion of business.  So as a result of that, I was able to do a number of business deals in Africa including the, playing a central role early on in the building of this West African Gas Pipeline.  Chevron [Overseas Petroleum Inc., San Ramon, California] approached me and asked me if, they learned of my presence here in Chicago [Illinois], even though I'm far away from Ghana, they knew that I represented the government of Ghana and they asked me if I would assist them in making contact with the government of Ghana.  They needed that contact in order to be able to facilitate the building of this pipeline, putting all the different pieces together.  They obviously had very good relations in Nigeria with the government of Nigeria because they had been pumping oil in Nigeria since, what, late '50s [1950s] or so or early '60s [1960s], but they didn't have ties with the Ghana government but I did, working directly with the president of Ghana [Jerry Rawlings] and other top officials in Ghana, minister of energy, for example.  I was able, over a period of three and a half years, to help Chevron and Shell [Oil Company], the two principal oil companies involved, to establish the relationships with the governments of, yeah.
Story_ID: 253635
Speaker 1: --Talking about your business activities in Africa and you were just talking to us about the [West African Gas] Pipeline and then becoming basically a representative of the Ghanaian government, business opportunities here (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I was.  I was a former representative of the government of Ghana and at one point even represented the president of Ghana on a legal matter.
Speaker 1: That's Jerry Rawlings, right?
Speaker 2: Jerry Rawlings was the president of Ghana at the time but with regards to the pipeline project, what I did basically was to assist, or be the principal point person for Chevron Overseas Petroleum [Inc., San Ramon, California] company and establishing relationships with the governments of Ghana and putting together the support for the building of this gas pipeline that is now actually about to be, believe it or not, just now about the, construction's about to start.  So I did that and then also with the assistance of the Ghanaian government, I also assisted in establishing relations, or support, for the pipeline project with the governments of Togo and Benin.  So I traveled extensively to West Africa on this project, sometimes traveling there, some years once a month, every month, at least once a month, traveling to West Africa for meetings even though I'm here in Chicago [Illinois], traveling from Chicago to meetings in Ghana, Togo, meetings would be in Togo, meetings would be in Benin, meetings would be in Nigeria, Abuja, Nigeria or Lekki, Nigeria, that's off the coast of, well near Lagos, Nigeria, where the Chevron facilities were established.  So I did a lot of travel in that regard to establish the project.
Story_ID: 253636
Speaker 1: Another prominent project in, in Africa which I worked as a consultant, establishing relations with the government of Ghana for an American company, was the company, Sony [Pictures]/Columbia Pictures, the company that made the movie on the life of Ali, Muhammad Ali, the movie title is 'Ali' and it starred Will Smith and filming was done in both Ghana and Mozambique and the company approached me and asked me to represent them in assisting and with setting, the relations with--
Speaker 2: This was, they were trying to recreate the trip to Zaire, the fight in Zaire?
Speaker 1: Yes, exactly, exactly, they were trying, and then also Muhammad Ali traveled to Ghana in addition to Zaire for the fights, fight with George Foreman in 1974.  So that was, those fight scenes were created in Mozambique but Muhammad Ali traveled to Ghana.  In fact, he met Malcolm X in Ghana in nineteen--I don't remember what year, maybe around 1964, right after he--
Speaker 2: It's '63 [1963] or '64 [1964].
Speaker 1: Yeah, '62 [1962], excuse me, around '62 [1962], soon after he had won the fight against Sonny Liston.  What was that, 1960--
Speaker 2: No, that was '74 [1974] when he--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --no '64 [1964] when he actually beat Sonny Liston.  It was '64 [1964].
Speaker 1: Okay, well he traveled to Ghana when he was heavyweight champ.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: When he was heavyweight champ.
Speaker 2: So it was '64 [1964] then.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so '64 [1964] and it was very interesting because he was received extremely well and it was a real eye-opening experience for Muhammad Ali and at that time, there was a very strong Pan-African spirit among many African leaders.  You had asked me off-screen, off-tape about Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia and, of course, he had a very strong Pan-African bent as well and so he was a strong Pan-African symbol and support of Pan-Africanism as many leaders did in Nigeria, [Nnamdi] Azikiwe, and many others in South Africa, throughout Africa, and that spirit was manifested probably most in [Kwame] Nkrumah of Ghana.  At one point you may recall that Nkrumah and Patrice Lumumba, though Patrice Lumumba was just briefly premier prime minister of [Democratic Republic of the] Congo [DRC], nonetheless he and Nkrumah establish a united state, Ghana and Congo, one country, just briefly, but just the same, Ali and Malcolm X were part of that strong Pan-African spirit so Ali was welcome in 1964 as this tremendously positive black hero, worldwide hero, for the Ghanaian people and for African people.  So, at any rate, this scene on his visit to Ghana, back then, was recreated in the movie and they do, it's, a credible job is done.
Story_ID: 253637
Speaker 1: Were you able to accomplish your goals with the [West African Gas] Pipeline?  Did they, did they--
Speaker 2: Yes, very much so.  It took a long time.
Speaker 1: So is gas now being piped to places in--
Speaker 2: Yes, natural gas from the gas and oil fields in Nigeria, off the coast of Nigeria, will eventually be piped into Ghana.  Ghana will be the primary user of the gas but also, Ghana will use about 85 percent of the natural gas but consumption will also be by Togo and Benin and eventually the idea is that the pipeline will extend up the West Coast through Cote d'Ivoire, or Ivory Coast, and onto Senegal, but construction should actually start in about, sometime this year, 2005.
Speaker 1: So, are they going to use most of the gas for cooking or for (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, it's hoped that it will be used for cooking.  This will help end the practice of using charcoal for cooking which causes deforestation, which is a major problem in Africa.  People cut down trees to make charcoal for cooking, et cetera, so use of the gas will play a significant role in eliminating that practice and then also it will be used for industry allowing the West African countries that consume this gas to have a cheap energy source for industry.  So it will play a significant role in their economy and this is what it's hoped for.  If, if they continue to have good leadership, or better leadership in these countries, they'll be able to do that.
Speaker 1: Okay, I didn't think of the industry part of it because it's hard to think of Ghana as having a lot of industry but there are, there's a big textile or there was a small (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, there's some textiles made there.
Speaker 1: --at least a fledgling textile industry there.
Speaker 2: Fledgling textile industry.  In fact, they're going to end manufactories of some automobile parts, small parts that are exported outside to Europe.  I don't think so much is done in the United States but there's some small scale industry there.  Textiles, automobile manufacturing, some consumer products like household items, soap, et cetera, this type of thing, et cetera--
Story_ID: 253638
Speaker 1: Do you have any thoughts about, I know in the, when [Kwame] Nkrumah was president [of Ghana], he tried to use cocoa as a lever against the West, or some lever, but they just stopped using Ghanaian cocoa and used it for--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and, so it wasn't much of a lever so, is there, I guess what I'm asking, is there any, is there any product, well the products of Sierra Leone and Liberia, took the diamonds and these, these minerals that are hard to find in other places, seems to keep those countries in turmoil, you know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --because of the corporations that are reaching and snatching this stuff out without having to really pay for it but are there any, are there any natural resources that the rest of the world just really needs from--
Speaker 2: From Ghana?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well Ghana is a major producer of gold.  And of course gold, of course, is a very valued commodity all around the world, obviously, but at the same time, just briefly, a brief comment, Africa's leverage with the world will come from Africa's development of itself not through use of any particular product whether it be oil from Nigeria or oil from Angola, which are really very valued, very prized, very necessary commodities in our country, in the United States and United States is making great efforts now to import more oil from Africa.  Recently, the president of Nigeria [Olusegun Obasanjo] was in the United States and, of course, readily sees President [George Walker] Bush and American presidents, whoever they may be, because oil is such a highly valuable commodity, obviously, in our country and African country produced quite a bit of oil but Africa's real leverage to the extent that it can begin to influence world politics is to develop itself and in order to do that, African countries must trade with each other.  They must do business with each other.  They must become integrated, slow process, but nonetheless a very workable process and this in turn will boost their living standards, living standards of African peoples there and also give them more leverage in the world.  When they are poor, when people are very poor and not able to take care of themselves, then what leverage can one have because one is always begging and there's no need for Africa to beg.  Africa has everything that it, people there have everything that, God gave them practically everything that they could possibly want, it's right there, they just have to do something, do more with it than they're currently doing, but they're working on it.
Story_ID: 253639
Speaker 1: Is it primarily the resistance of the West that keeps the development down or is it an organizational problem or internal problem?
Speaker 2: Well, if you were a business leader in France, at a major industry in France and much of your raw material came from Ivory Coast [Cote d'Ivoire] for your products that you manufacture in France or elsewhere and sell worldwide, then of course you're not likely to tolerate a leadership in the Ivory Coast that says, "Look, we're going to develop cocoa product or process cocoa product ourselves," or, we want, or demand, that cocoa products be manufactured here so that we can add value to our raw materials and thus make more money from the production of these products, candy and whatever else cocoa is used for throughout the world.  So as to develop our own economy, develop our own people, you, the business community in France that uses that product, is going to be less reluctant to, or very reluctant, rather, to support a leader who has a very strong nationalist bent, a leader that is keen towards developing the Ivory Coast for the local people and this is worldwide.  I mean, in other words, meaning that the countries that benefit from Africa so substantially are less likely--are not keen on seeing leadership that is determined to develop resources, local resources for the development of these countries and a great example of that is, of course, the great Patrice Lumumba.  He was killed, the great leader of the [Democratic Republic of the] Congo [DRC].  I often times refer to him as a Malcolm X of the Congo.  This is something I do because I admire Patrice Lumumba so much.  He was not anti-white, not anti-European, not at all.  He wanted very much to work with the Europeans.  He knew that he had to work with the Europeans in order to develop a Congo but at the same time he knew that in doing so, working with, or working to develop the economy of the Congo such that it would really benefit these great natural resources in the Congo would benefit the Congolese people, they'd have a unified state, et cetera, it would go against the interest of many Belgians who were exploiting the Congo and it just so happened that those Belgians who were exploiting the Congo for their own ends, they were the ones who had influence and power in the Congo.  So, generally like I said earlier, just in a very general way, in order for Africa to have leverage for Africa to develop, Africa must become integrated meaning that these countries must trade with each other, they must begin to develop real strong relationships with each other across the board, both trade and political and this is something that they're doing but that doesn't coincide with the interest of those who do exploit Africa.
Story_ID: 253640
Speaker 1: In that regard, you know, well the United States had probably a bit of influence over what happened to Patrice Lumumba from what I've heard.
Speaker 2: Yes he did.
Speaker 1: I think Frank Carlucci of the, was, who was an official of the [President Ronald Wilson] Reagan administration, later on was a CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] operative over there--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --during the time, they were manipulating things and do you ever, as somebody doing trade and business in Africa, there's so much interest in Africa as a business opportunity with the major universities in the Midwest all have African studies departments, do a lot of focus on business in Africa--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and training white students here, for the most part, white American students to speak African languages and go over and trade.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Then this is to see, the University of Wisconsin[-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin], University of Minnesota [Twin Cities, Minneapolis, Minnesota], University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], Indiana U [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana], they, you know, Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois] have these African studies department where they do, do you ever find yourself in a position of, of being caught in the middle of these interests because you seem to be, you're doing business and you seem to be conscious of trying to do something that's going to benefit African people but there are a lot of people there who really are not very concerned about it and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, very much so, exactly, very much so.
Speaker 1: --they're very well prepared, too.
Speaker 2: Yes, very much so.  I don't represent everybody who comes to me because not everybody has the interest of Africa at heart.  They simply want to make money and move on and projects they have in mind are not projects that will benefit African people at all, so I don't represent everybody, no question about that.  So I have to be selective, but Africa does need business from abroad.  There's just no question about that.  It needs ties with our country here.  It needs ties with its people here, meaning African American people here.  There's just no question about that and those ties, those business interests don't have to be antithetical, meaning against our interest here in the United States.  They're not.  It's in our interest as Americans, it's in our interest as African Americans, that Africa is developed, that Africa does begin to realize its potential, its enormous potential and that potential will eventually be realized, just no question about it.  So, for us here to say, either take an extreme position and say, no business from the United States, no outside interest, that would be suicidal for Africa, it would be against the march of history, so to speak, unrealistic in every way.  The point since it is realistic to have these ties, then let's have the best ties.  Let's have the ties that develop Africa and develop our own country here in the United States and these, so it's all consistent, but for people who are in power, not everybody sees it that way because so many people who are in power who make money off Africa have a very short-term vision.  "I want to make my money during my lifetime.  I want to make as much money as I can in my lifetime, more money than the next person in my lifetime," but development in Africa is a long-term project and so it requires a long-term vision.
Story_ID: 253641
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your political activities.  Now you've known former president of South Africa, Nelson Mandela--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --the great leader, Nelson Mandela for many years.  Can you tell us how you first met him and how you got, you said you got involved in ANC [African National Congress] for the first time in '70 [1970]--
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy [1970].
Speaker 1: Seventy [1970].
Speaker 2: Right.  My first involvement with the South African anti-apartheid issues was when I was in college at Dartmouth College [Hanover, New Hampshire].  I was a leader of student opposition to official representatives from the Portuguese government speaking on Dartmouth College campus back in 1966, I think it was, sixty--the winter of '66 [1966], January, February, March of '66 [1966], I was just a freshman student and I knew enough about what was happening in Southern Africa to oppose--to know that it wasn't in my interest to have the Portuguese rule in Angola and Mozambique.  It wasn't in the interest of the African people to have the Portuguese rule in Angola and Mozambique, that I knew at that time and at that time also I met the founder, one of the founders, the principal founders of FRELIMO [Mozambique Liberation Front], the Mozambican liberation movement, Eduardo Mondlane.  He visited a supporter, a white American supporter of the liberation movement in Mozambique who lived in Vermont and I had a college professor [Christian P. Potholm], a white professor, who also was keenly supportive of the liberation struggle in Mozambique and Angola and this professor I knew or met as a result of my being a student at Dartmouth and he introduced me to Eduardo Mondlane.  So I spent two, three days sitting, listening to Eduardo Mondlane meet with his friend who was a financial supporter, backer of FRELIMO, in Vermont, small farm, I think it was, maybe a big farm but in a small area, rural area of, I think it was Vermont.  So I learned quite a bit and when these speakers, government representatives from Lisbon, Portugal came to Dartmouth College to speak, they were on a tour of American universities, spoke at Dartmouth, I was one of the people to oppose their speaking there.  That taught me even more about what was going on because at one point I had an audience with one of these speakers and, of course, he was defending the Portuguese position.  I couldn't speak as detailed as he could, obviously, all I could do was speak in broad general analogies and he even offered me a trip to these colonies, Mozambique and Angola, and I said, obviously it didn't make any sense, but my mother [Annie Bennett] would never have allowed me to go anyway.
Story_ID: 253642
Speaker 1: Just the same, when I traveled to East Africa in 1970, I had a background of knowing about the liberation struggles in Southern Africa, the struggles against the Portuguese and also the struggle against the Afrikaners leadership in South Africa against apartheid.  And it so happened that a number of the leaders, the exiled headquarters of the ANC [African National Congress] in 1970 was in Dar es Salaam [Tanzania] and I spent a month there and these men, and women, were meeting oftentimes at the University of Dar es Salaam [Dar es Salaam, Tanzania] and I'd just attend their meetings in my short pants and sandals and just sit there listening to whatever they said about the anti-apartheid struggle and what they--
Speaker 2: Did, excuse me for asking, did they ever have any concern that you might not be on their side sitting there?
Speaker 1: Well they'd sit outside, under the tree, and with folding chairs, I'd sit there, too, and I was very young, I was just twenty-one, twenty-two years old.  If they had any concerns or fears, they sure didn't show it and I certainly didn't look like a threat and I was barely, had barely enough money, where I was staying, indicated that I was, didn't have any money, I had as little money as they did because it was a Windsor Hotel [ph.] which is the cheapest hotel in town and I ate the little simple food they did 'cause I didn't have any money and they may have had a little more, I may have had more money than them, but not much.  So, if they had, I was clearly not a threat and the questions I asked, comments I would make, et cetera and I was just soaking it all in, just learning, and as a result of that, I became a real, stronger supporter of them than I had been before I had that experience and once I got back to school, Yale Law School [New Haven, Connecticut], I increased my interest, I talked about the struggle in different forms and community settings, et cetera because I lived in the community and this was something I always promoted.  I participated in demonstrations and over the years as I made money as a lawyer, I donated money to the ANC whenever they would, leadership would travel to Chicago [Illinois], I was always a person to host them.  I hosted one gentleman whom I met many years ago in 1970, Alfred [Baphethuxolo] Nzo, who became the first black foreign minister of South Africa, or the foreign minister, and President [Nelson] Mandela's cabinet, he and I became personal friends.  I met him years and years ago and, when I was just a very, very young student and it's a relationship that continued until his death.  So I, as I made money, I gave them money or made donations to them.  I raised money for them when Nzo visited Chicago in 1985 or '86 [1986], I think it was.  He was here for ten days.  [HistoryMaker] Harold Rogers who was a great supporter of the ANC probably the supporter here in the Chicago area who led the anti-apartheid movement here in the Chicago area for sure.  Well, he and I worked very closely together in support of the ANC.
Story_ID: 253643
Speaker 1: And when Nzo came here [Chicago, Illinois], Alfred [Baphethuxolo] Nzo came here with his delegation, we paid for everything.  I paid for all of their accommodations for ten days.  I fed them at my home.  I raised money for them.  I mean, just simply took care of them, basically, and at that point I did have a home, did have access to some money and so it went to them.  I gave them donations, raised money for them, et cetera, washed their clothes, all these type of things.  My mother [Annie Bennett], my wife saw to that that they had clean clothes, new clothes, you bought clothes for them, et cetera, this type of thing, et cetera.  This man became the foreign minister and just as an example, when he and [Nelson] Mandela visited the United States on a state visit, after Mandela had been sworn in as president of South Africa, I was asked to come meet them in Washington, D.C. and I met both, Nzo and Mandela at Blair House [President's Guest House, Washington, D.C.], where Mandela stayed.  That's the United States, president of the United States' guest house, which is a very interesting experience as well, but long before that, or not so long before that, I was involved with ANC [African National Congress] and its negotiations with the anti-apartheid government.  As a result of my long experience with ANC, of course as you can well imagine, I met many, many people.  One of the people I met was a gentleman named [Molapatene] Collins Ramusi.  I met him in Chicago in 1976, I think it was.  Yeah, in 1976.  He had come here at the height of the Soweto Uprising.  I saw him on television being interviewed on television and he mentioned that he was staying with some whites here, young whites, and I thought to myself, why should he be staying with whites when I have a place to stay and he just left South Africa?  I did not know his background in way whatsoever but I just felt that I should be supportive so I knew [HistoryMaker] Vernon Jarrett who was interviewing him and I contacted Vernon and said, well where is this guy staying?  Let me meet him and I can be of assistance to him.  So, I offered him a place to stay.  He stayed at my home for six months and I found him a job and did a number of other things for him, et cetera, so over the years and later when things changed in South Africa, I had no idea that they would change, my South African friends kept telling me, ANC friends kept telling me, they would change, that things, that they, blacks would come to power and I'd always say, "Yes, okay, I agree," but I really didn't agree.  I didn't think, I didn't see how.  And so I just helped them, not because I thought I'd get anything out of it, but just to be helpful.
Story_ID: 253644
Speaker 1: So anyway, eventually Mr. [Molapatene Collins] Ramusi went back to South Africa and he lived in the Northern [Transvaal; Limpopo, South Africa] area of the country, not too far from Zimbabwe.  He lived north of Pietersburg [Polokwane, South Africa] and so he invited me to come to the country and work with ANC [African National Congress] and other ANC leaders asked me to come as well, and I did.
Speaker 2: About what year is this?
Speaker 1: This was 1991, in '91 [1991], I went to South Africa twice in 1991 and Mr. Ramusi was a participant in the negotiations with the anti-apartheid government.
Speaker 2: With the apartheid government [National Party] actually.
Speaker 1: With the apartheid government, excuse me, with the apartheid government, and what happened was that the way things were structured, I think there were like twenty-six political parties in South Africa.  The principal ones were the ANC, of course, the national party and then also the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP], party which Chief [Mangosuthu] Buthelezi headed.  And then there was a party from the northern part of the country where Mr. Ramusi lived.  Well Mr. Ramusi was one of the representatives of that party.  Mr. Ramusi took me everywhere he went.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He was a lawyer, I was a lawyer, so we went everywhere.
Speaker 2: Was he a member of the PAC [Pan Africanist Congress of Azania] or--
Speaker 1: He was a member of the African National Congress.
Speaker 2: Oh, ANC, okay.
Speaker 1: He was eventually elected into the Parliament [of the Republic of South Africa].  So Mr. Ramusi went to all the key negotiations or the key negotiations and I was his assistant.  Went right there with him.  So I'm sitting up in the, this is the honest truth.  This was in '92 [1992], May 15th through May 17, 1992, this was a big national meeting, right outside Johannesburg [South Africa], all the political parties, of course there's lobbying going on in the country, a lot of fighting, et cetera, this was the first time, this is not the first time I had met Nelson Mandela, I met him the first time, I think it was in 1991, I'll talk to you about that, '92 [1992], I'm not too sure when I'll, '91 [1991] I think it was.  I'll tell you about that in a moment but the negotiations that I attended, some of the, part of the negotiations, I attended others as well, but these were the big negotiations, they were called CODESA, Convention for a Democratic South Africa.  This was a forum at which all the different political parties came together to negotiate.  Of course, there were a lot of negotiations taking place outside of the convocation of all the different political parties but the convocation of all the political parties where the decisions were made.  So I was there.  I sat right there.  This is the honest truth.  Of course, in the plenary session, there was the United Nations [UN] and different foreign representatives, I was sitting there, too.
Speaker 2: So who were some of the figures involved?
Speaker 1: I can't remember.
Speaker 2: Was [Allan] Boesak there for the--
Speaker 1: Who?
Speaker 2: Allan Boesak or--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, yes.
Speaker 2: Bishop [Desmond] Tutu and--
Speaker 1: Oh, they're all there.  I've seen these people many times.  The names you see and read about, even at the negotiations there's a--
Speaker 2: Who was the president of South Africa then, was he there?
Speaker 1: F.W. de Klerk.
Speaker 2: de Klerk, yeah.
Speaker 1: At the negotiations, there was a lunch break so we'd all go to the cafeteria to eat lunch.  de Klerk was like sitting two tables from me.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  Yeah, de Klerk and there was another guy that used to come on 'Nightline,' another, Cougar [ph.]--
Speaker 1: Cyril Ramaphosa.
Speaker 2: No, it was a white guy, a white guy in charge of security or something.  He used to come on--
Speaker 1: There was--
Speaker 2: --and talk about.
Speaker 1: I met their negotiator, the chief negotiator, Tertius Delport.  He was de Klerk's chief negotiator.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 253645
Speaker 1: I get the sense that it was hard for you to believe that you were there [in South Africa] at these negotiations (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, it was hard for me to believe.  From May 15th to May 17, 1992, the ANC [African National Congress] and the National Party conducted negotiations along with others, Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP], and other leading political figures throughout South Africa, conducted negotiations at the World Trade Centre in, right outside Johannesburg [South Africa] and my friend, an ANC colleague, [Molapatene] Collins Ramusi, was a delegate to those talks and I had worked very closely with Mr. Ramusi in the Northern Transvaal [Limpopo, South Africa], away from the public eye organizing for the ANC there on my visits.  And, again, this was not any highfalutin anything, it was grassroots level.  There were no cameras there.  We were organizing in the mountains, I'm driving a little pick-up truck to go through the outlying black areas, the rural areas, and we're just talking.  Believe me, it's a, it was a fascinating experience.  So later we went to Johannesburg for these talks and Mr. Ramusi, wherever Mr. Ramusi went, I went right there, at the meetings, in addition to the plenary sessions where all the different people from around the world would attend.  The United Nations [UN] representative, representative from the United States, the United States ambassador, for example, ambassadors from other major countries around the world, they were in attendance supporting the negotiating process.  Then there were actual meetings, negotiating meetings as well.  I attended those with Mr. Ramusi and there were, each party had two representatives.  For example, the ANC had two representatives, Cyril Ramaphosa was the lead representative and in the chair behind him was [Mohammed] Valli Moosa.  The National Party had two representatives, the representative for the National Party was Tertius Delport, he was their leading negotiator, then there was a representative [Roelf Meyer], his second.  Well, Mr. Ramusi represented one of the parties from the north, political parties from the north.  I was his second.  Now, of course, I said nothing because I'm saying to myself, what am I doing here?  But there I was and so at the meetings, this was in the constitutional workshop, the negotiating sessions had five workshops.  One was on the Constitution [of the Republic of South Africa], how to amend the change, amend or change the constitution for the new South Africa, there was another workshop on the transition from the old apartheid government to the new government, how was the transition going to take place.  There was a workshop on, I can't recall all of the workshop but I have papers and documents that list all of them, but I worked on the constitutional workshop, or constitutional group, and this dealt with issues.  For example, one of the key issues that were discussed when I attended the meetings in negotiation, was whether the constitution could be amended, the new constitution could be amended by sixty-six and two-third vote which is what the ANC was pushing or should it be, I think the National Party, the white apartheid government wanted to be 62 percenters.  They wanted, excuse me, they wanted like 70 some percent or something like that.  And so, they wanted it because if it had, the higher the percentage, the more power they would have.  So, ANC, I think they finally settled on about sixty-six and some percent.  Some of the delegates from the ANC, once we had the small strategy meeting, they were pushing for a higher percentage, a lower percentage, 62 something percent.  And I remember after the negotiating sessions at which I attended with Mr. Ramusi then there was small strategy meetings.  ANC, top people, Nelson Mandela, Thabo Mbeki, who's current president of South Africa, Walter Sisulu and others, I was right there, sat right there, just listened, so it was just absolutely a fascinating process, just truly a fascinating process.
Story_ID: 253646
Speaker 1: I met Mr. [Nelson] Mandela--that was not the first time I met him.  In fact, one, on that occasion, I remember at one point, I was in the bathroom, they had a small one toilet bathroom, one toilet and one urinal bathroom, and I was using the bathroom.  So, door opens, here comes Mandela to use the toilet and I'm saying, whoa, wait a minute here, you know, but that was the toilet, that was the bathroom for the leaderships so I was sitting there with these guys so I used it, too, and here he comes to use it.  But I had met him the first time in, I think it was '91 [1991] when the ANC [African National Congress] had its first convention [Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA)] in South Africa in over thirty years since they had been exiled since 1961.  They had a, their convention bringing back all their leaders from around the world, all their people who had been exiled, people who were in prison for so many years, they all came together for the first time meeting each other for the very first time in thirty years.  That was in Durban [South Africa], right outside Durban, in 1991, and I went to that meeting.  It was a closed meeting, of course, closed convention.  It was absolutely fascinating to see Mandela meet colleagues of his whom he had not seen since 1961.  It was absolutely fascinating.  It was, I was there with him at the convention which was held at the, I think it's called the University of [Durban-]Westville [University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa], this is right outside Durban, and then I was with them when they were at the hotel, the hotel where most of them stayed there in Durban and I had driven from the Northern Transvaal [Limpopo, South Africa] to Durban for these meetings.  That was an interesting experience.  First time I had driven across country like that but that was a fascinating experience to be there with them.  I almost wanted to cry myself to see these men and women meet each other for the first time in thirty years.  And there's another interesting experience, Mr. Mandela's current wife, Graca Machel, because I was a supporter of the ANC for so many years here, and when they did come here, [HistoryMaker] Harold Rogers and I would take care of them.  So Graca Machel visited Chicago [Illinois] in 1988.  She's the former first lady of Mozambique, former wife of Samora Machel who was killed on a plane crash, I don't remember what year now, but in the late '70s [1970s] or early '80s [1980s], she visited Chicago supporting, of course, the liberation struggles in Southern Africa and, of course, where did she go?  She was at my home because I hosted everybody, so I hosted her.  Everybody who came, all the liberation people, et cetera, people involved in the struggle, they were with me and she's now married to Nelson Mandela.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: So I know her quite well.  I know her children quite well, again, so anyway, that's part of my background with South Africa.
Story_ID: 253647
Speaker 1: What were your impressions of the Afrikaners at those meetings [Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA)]?  Did you, I mean, were they what you expected them to be like or were they different?
Speaker 2: It was interesting because my, when I started traveling to South Africa in 1991, I didn't spend time in Johannesburg [South Africa], I didn't even visit Cape Town [South Africa] until 1994.  I didn't arrive in Johannesburg, visit Soweto [Johannesburg, South Africa] for a few minutes or so, and then go immediately to the North and work there, which is an Afrikaner stronghold.  That's where the Afrikaners were really the strongest even though the province, it was called the Northern Province [Northern Transvaal] then, now it's called Limpopo [South Africa].  Drive through Pretoria [South Africa], current administrative capitol on the way to the north, et cetera and there were these interesting names, Naboomspruit [Limpopo, South Africa], I say what kind of name is that?  That's the name of the city and there were so many other strange looking names, Afrikaner names, and it was just a fascinating place because the Afrikaners would oftentimes walk around with guns on their hips and even in the wintertime when it, and it gets cold there in South Africa, I mean it's in the thirties, these people would wear short pants.  It was like, it reminded me of Ku Klux Klan [KKK] Georgia when I was growing up.  They were people, the Afrikaner people were obviously people who tried to lord it over the black people, who had lorded over the black people, but they were few in number, and that was obvious.  In Pietersburg [Polokwane, Limpopo, South Africa], everybody on the street just about wore black, everybody, just about was black, but there are the white people, strutting around like they were in charge.  Of course, they were in charge, but the black people went about as if to say, "Well, we're in charge because this is ours.  We respect you or we're not going to bother you because not only do you have the power but you're people like us and we see you like us.  You're just human, like us," and so there was, everybody is like in the South in this country, everybody knew their place and respected their place.  Once the work day was over, we headed out of Pietersburg, back to the rural areas where the blacks lived, where I was staying.  In other words, and it got dark, we, we're out of town.  So everybody had very good relations with each other in a sense that what I saw, meaning they were friendly, they were cordial, but underneath all that, there was this obvious, just great tension.  So it was very interesting to see this in 1991.  I was seeing the last vestiges of it because, of course, it changed quite a bit but I found the Afrikaner people to be committed to staying there, not leaving at all.  I found them very committed to their own culture, that was very obvious and to be honest with you, though apartheid was a very brutal system, still, as long as everybody stayed within their place, there were cordial and respectful relationships, just like in the South.
Story_ID: 253648
Speaker 1: I want to jump to the aftermath of the, of liberation in South Africa and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission [TRC].  I know a lot of African Americans looked at that with bewilderment, you know, as to how war criminals, you know, some of these brutal police leaders of South Africa were allowed to just testify as to what they had done during apartheid and basically left alone, you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Last year I was in South Africa at a meeting in which president, former President [Nelson] Mandela spoke and he, in fact, some of the comments he made at the time, in fact he was criticizing President [George Walker] Bush.  This was at a, right before the Iraq War, American's invasion of Iraq, and President Mandela made some very harsh comments about President Bush and the, his, President Bush's determination to go to war, his decision to go to war against Iraq.  During that meeting, it was a relatively small number of people there, maybe a hundred people or so, Mandela was asked some questions, it was a question and answer period, maybe fewer than a hundred people, he was asked some questions, and some young South African stood up and asked Mandela, it was more of a statement of his than a question, this young man, and the guy had to be about thirty something years old and I say, maybe thirty, thirty-five, and he attacked Mandela saying, "Not yet, Uhuru ["freedom"], we don't yet have freedom," and it, not only that question and the comments that the man made--those comments he made--I thought it was an insult to Mandela, I thought it was an insult to the liberation movement, et cetera.  It was like one of those hothead militant-type statement, those extreme statements from the left, so to speak, and this is what Mandela said, an angry Mandela first off, and Mandela said, "How dare you," this is what he said to the person, "How dare you question what we've done," and he went on to say, Mandela did, he said, "We didn't defeat the whites on the battlefield, whites are not prone," he used the word "prone."  "The whites are not prone, they were not prone and they're not prone."  He went on to say, "Look, we had to make an accommodation with these people."  So, in making an accommodation, and I happen to believe that that was the correct course, Mandela's generation had taken the struggle as far as they could take it, now it's up to the next generation to take it even farther, but in a different way, than Mandela's generation.  The struggle is not an overnight struggle, it's a struggle that takes time.  It's over time and at different phases to it and this is what Mandela was trying to get that young man to see, different phases to it.  So, yes, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission with obvious war criminals who had no real remorse, nonetheless there's a greater good to it or more positive to the whole process in my view than the negative and I've sat with Bishop [Desmond] Tutu numbers of times just, just like you and I sitting here, no big deal.
Story_ID: 253649
Speaker 1: I sat with Walter Sisulu in home setting, no big deal, just sitting and they're talking, he and his colleagues are talking, [Nelson] Mandela's talking, and I'm just sitting there listening because I'm friends with some of the people at the highest level of the government and I just sit there and I listen.  I haven't made a comment here and there.  In fact, I remember meeting with Walter Sisulu and I asked him, "What about black Americans," questions you asked of me, "What impact did the black American struggle have on you?"  This is the great Walter Sisulu and he's Mandela's mentor and he gave me all kinds of comments.  We're just sitting there talking like you, comrades or friends or colleagues or whatever, although he's much older, much different struggle than what I'm engaged in, et cetera, at least on a different level.  So anyway, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission [TRC], I think was a very positive step, notwithstanding the shortcomings of it, but a positive step for the South African people as all blacks and whites.  These type of things have to, these type of issues have to be aired, they have to be out in the public, out in the sun, so that there can be healing, the fresh air, the sun heals, open air heals, the sunlight heals, not like the United States where there's never been a truth and reconciliation commission.  All these horrible crimes that have taken place have been buried underneath the surface, never confronted.  People act as if they never happened and yet at the same time, the anger, the bitterness is still there amongst the African American people, notwithstanding what people say, how good things are, and they are good in many ways here in the United States.  We've made unbelievable progress, both peoples, white Americans and blacks, but a lot of anger, tremendous anger, tremendous bitterness exist among African Americans in part because there has never been a truth and reconciliation commission here, that is, the kind of process here to bring these things out in the open that have happened.  It's not possible to bury these things like that and expect relationships to be harmonious and good friends.  People will be good friends, it can't happen unless these issues are brought up and then at some point it will have to happen in our country for us to really be closer to each other than we actually are.
Story_ID: 253650
Speaker 1: Is there anything else?  Any other observations about that process 'cause you, you're sitting right in the middle of, I mean it's quite, it's been a, I guess one of the, I guess in the last ten years, there's probably the most dramatic happening for African people worldwide, the demise of apartheid in South Africa.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well the demise of apartheid was a tremendously significant event worldwide, not only was it significant for the South African people, white as well as black, because it freed them as well, whites as well as blacks, it really did in significant ways, just like the success of the Civil Rights Movement here, freed whites in many, many ways as well as African American people.  In other words, it's positive for the country as a whole for all the peoples here.  I mean, what sense does it make in America to continue to treat black people, to oppress black people?  That made no sense whatsoever and whites couldn't feel good about themselves, white Americans couldn't feel good about themselves to see us denied opportunities like that but we all feel better about our country as a result of it.  Well, it's the same in South Africa and because of the way it happened in South Africa, where it is with this great figure of Nelson Mandela being a person of tremendous spirit, tremendous principle, people around the world take that as an example, take that as a very true source of inspiration for the human spirit.  I mean, here's a man who spent all these many, many years in prison, horrific conditions.  I visited Robben Island [South Africa] a few years back with my mother [Annie Bennett] and my children, traveling in South Africa and my mother, once we got to the front gates, she says, "I can't take anymore."
Speaker 1: We learned yesterday, [HistoryMaker] Prexy Nesbitt was here yesterday, he had a photo of his sons with Nelson Mandela and he said that he wanted to have a photo taken himself but he thought that he would, he would give President Mandela a break because his eyes were injured in Robben Island--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and he doesn't like, flash bulbs cause him pain, actually and--
Speaker 2: Right, exactly, right because of the limestone quarries or limestone pits that the prisoners were forced to dig, when sunlight, and of course there's very, very bright sunlight in Southern Africa, throughout the year, and there these men would be forced to dig these limestone, digging these limestone pits and the sunlight would reflect off the pits with such intensity that it would damage their eyes and they were required to do this without any type of protection to their eyes and Mr. Mandela's eyes were damaged as a result of this and so many others of the prisoners were, and I've met a number of men in South Africa who spent many years in prison, including Robben Island, many years in Robben Island.  We don't know their names, and publicly, but I've met people who spent twenty years there.  These are people who are known in the South African liberation movement but they're not known here, all kinds of suffering as a result of those kind of experiences, yet they continue to go forward and continue to look for a, the achievement of a multi-racial society.
Story_ID: 253651
Speaker 1: What are your main activities now?  Your recent activities?  What are your plans for the future?  You're still relatively young by our standards of interviews.
Speaker 2: Well I, I continue to practice law and I continue to do international business work so I continue to travel to Africa, the same type of things I've been doing before, but also I have some political ambitions here, which I won't state at the moment, but it's something I always wanted to do and would like to do and hopefully as folks would say, the stars are lined just right and I have an opportunity to, to do for our people here, our African American people and whites as well, some positive things that will move our struggle as a whole forward.  So that's really what I'd like to do.
Story_ID: 253652
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: I think for our people here, the African American people, we must begin to increase the pace of building our relationship with Africa, with the African peoples on the continent.  Many of us traveled to Africa, we travel as tourists and it's a life-transforming experience for us, life-transforming in terms of the way we look at ourselves and the way we look at the world.  It's a broadening experience for our people who travel to Africa and it's a very positive experience in that it's a real self-esteem experience.  Africa's future and our future here is linked and we have to figure out, those of us here, and those of us there, have to figure out how to achieve that future that is common to both of us.  I remember when my mother [Annie Bennett] visited Africa.  I talked to her about the difficulties that, the friction that sometimes exist between us and Africans from the homeland and my mother said, "Well, look at it this way, it's like a family that's been separated or any family that's been separated for a long period of time, there's going to be problems getting back together and families have to work through those problems," and that's the way it is with us but Africa will play, the continent will play a significant role in our future here in America and in America's future because we're a very significant part of America.  Although we're called minorities and it was what twenty years ago and that term, when it first started being popularized here, the use of the term minority in, which is obviously an attempt to marginalize African Americans and to have to see ourselves as on the margins, we've never been on the margins of American history and of American society.  We've always been front and center and we still are.  And so what we do, how we go, has a very impact on our country as a whole and Africa, how Africa goes, has a very impact, very big, how it may go in the future, has a, potentially have a tremendous impact on us here.  So we have to be a part of that in making all of that happen.  So I think that over time our increased integrated relationship with African people from the African continent will make a big difference in us here in terms of how we look at ourselves, our own self-esteem, our productiveness in America, our productiveness worldwide and I think it will transform the United States in a very significant and a very positive way and that's something we should all work for and if I am blessed to be able to have a political career, these are some of the things that I will talk about.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And for sure.
Story_ID: 253653
Speaker 1: Sir, when you look back at all the things that you've done and, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  No, I don't think so.  No, I don't think so.  I think the way my life has worked out has brought real benefit to me and my family, my children, and hopefully its brought real benefit to some other peoples.  I think it has and hopefully, because I do want to make some different changes in my life from here on, hopefully it will reach, it'll embrace the benefits of my life, will embrace even more people but no, I wouldn't change anything so far.
Story_ID: 253654
Speaker 1: You mentioned your children and family.  Do you want to talk about your family?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I have three children.  Thank goodness they're all grown now but I have a son, my daughter, she graduated from Wesleyan University in [Middletown] Connecticut.  They all went to the University of Chicago Lab School [University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, Chicago, Illinois] from nursery and kindergarten through high school.  My daughter graduated from Wesleyan.  She is in grad [graduate] school now in San Francisco [California] for a Ph.D. in psychology and my, I have a son, who's finishing up at Emory University [Atlanta, Georgia] and a son who--in Atlanta [Georgia]--and a son who's finishing up at [The] George Washington University in Washington, D.C., and they're doing well.  I'm very happy about how well they're doing and for me, first and foremost, is family.  I really do enjoy being a family person even though I've traveled a lot, all these trips, I never stay more than ten days, from the time I leave Chicago [Illinois], to the time I get back, it's ten days because I want to be with my children and for many, many years, I just raised my children all by myself.
Story_ID: 253655
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Annie Bennett] get a chance to see you become successful?
Speaker 2: My mother?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I talk to my mother almost every day.
Speaker 1: Oh, really.  Oh, she's still alive, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And plus I don't even think of myself as being some big success even with [The] HistoryMakers.  I say to my mother, what history did I make but at any rate, no, I talk to my mother every day.  So my mother, and she's traveled to Europe, traveled to Africa, I built a home for my mother in 1990.  I bought two acres of land and said to my mother, "Choose a design that you want and I'll build it."  So, she chose a design, I wouldn't have chosen it, it looked like, she has these, it's a colonial-style home like the one you would find in the old South with the four columns, the white columns in the front, that's what my mother wanted (laughter) so I wouldn't have built that, but it's a very nice house and she enjoys it and I bought a car for her, a very nice car, a Mercedes [Benz] for her and, that, she drives that, so she's so far she's been, I've been able to take very good care of her so she lives well and that type of thing.
Story_ID: 253656
Speaker 1: When you look back at your career, what do you think constitutes your legacy at this point?
Speaker 2: I don't see myself as having a legacy except that, well I don't see myself as being finished, so to speak, and I, to the extent I have a legacy would be with my children.  I would hope that my children see in their father somebody who's a very principled man, I hope I am, and somebody who's committed to the liberation of African people, black people here in America and black people elsewhere.  I like to read and this type of thing and just like reading or traveling, I don't travel just to travel, I don't read just to read, I read to learn, I read so that I can, I like history and I read to learn so that I can be in a position to be helpful.  So hopefully if I do have a legacy at the moment, I would say it's my children and hopefully if I'm successful at what I hope to do in the future, then it will extend beyond my children.
Story_ID: 253657
Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?  It's a little bit different.
Speaker 2: I think, remembered in a way in which, remembered as a person who, the way I talked about the legacy of my children as a principled person, clean living person, a person committed to liberation, true liberation of African people and then also a person who hopefully, hopefully this will happen, a person who was able to make a real contribution towards that.
