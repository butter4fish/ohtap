Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five lightweight People magazine-ish type questions that we always ask, and they only require a short answer.  They're like a warm-up.  First question is, do you have a favorite food?

Story_ID: 434943
Speaker 1: Well, I'm gonna ask about your family history now.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Oliver King, Sr.] side of the family.  But, we'll start with your mother's side first.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Evelyne, with an e on the end, Alice Maxwell King [Evelyne Maxwell King].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in Brooklyn, New York.  And, I don't remember, I'll have to get that to you.  But, I think she was born sometime around 1914, 1913--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, circa 1914.
Speaker 2: Yeah, circa 1914.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, what can you tell us about the ancestors on your mother's side?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: I can go back, I know, to my great-grandmother who was called Momma Dodds [ph.].  And, she was quite fascinating to me as a child because she lived the majority of her life, I thought, on the island of Barbados.  And, I thought that she was born in Barbados.  In fact, a few years ago my uncle informed me that this woman who I had thought was, you know, a rather light-skinned black woman, was really an English woman who had migrated from England to Barbados, married my grandfather [sic. great-grandfather] who was very dark-skinned, and they had seven children.  I remember meeting her when I was about ten or twelve years old when I aunts brought her from the island to the United States because at the time she was like ninety-one years old.  And, she was becoming very frail.  And, she was a tiny, tiny, little lady, and she had very long hair; long white ponytail down her back.  And, I remember her not saying much because she was very angry that she was forced to leave the island.  She lived independently for a long time after my great-grandfather died.  She had her own chickens, her own house.  And, she was a very independent woman.  And, when they brought her from the islands, they made her get in a wheelchair.  Which I think, on reflection really undermined her sense of in--self presence and integrity and it just made her feel like an invalid.   And, so, she was furious with my aunts; her daughters, her daughter.
Speaker 1: Now, there's something that I wanna throw in here that, and I don't know if there any link or not but, there was a noted soldier of African American origin around the turn of the century in Britain [sic.] called Alfred E. Dodds [sic. Alfred A. Dodds], D-O-D-D-S.  I don't know, there may be some connection, I don't know but--
Speaker 2: I would not be surprised.  Barbados is a small island.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Many of the families were connected by the various plantations that were there.  The English and the Irish were settlers or colonizers of that island; primarily the English.  But, there were, on my father's side I believe, the mix was from the Irish settlers that came to Barbados.  My mother's side, my maternal side was clearly from the English.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Now, I--
Speaker 2: So, this solider could easily had been, if I do some checking.
Speaker 1: At a glance, Alfred E. Dodds looks very European looking.  But, he's know, you know, known to have African ancestors.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, they treated him as such (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Which is probably not the best.  But, that's--
Speaker 2: Well, those were conditions of the times.
Speaker 1: But, he was a heroic figure--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: In British military history--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, I just wanted to throw that out there (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Well, that name would have been because there are certain names on the island which, you know, Dodds, Blackmon, Maxwell, King, Thomas; those are all the name, and those are popular names from a section of the island called Christ Church [Barbados] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.  I've heard of it.
Speaker 2: All right.  So, my family is primarily from Christ Church in Barbados.
Story_ID: 434944
Speaker 1: Are there any, any family stories that are passed down about your family in Barbados?
Speaker 2: My family ironically did not talk about things that happened in Barbados.  In fact, I remember my brother [Oliver King, Jr.] and I came along about the period of the, you know, the 1960s, and the '70s [1970s] when we were all involved in the black power, the Civil Rights Movement.  We would ask questions, about what happened and what was, what was going on, and what was life like?  And, the one thing that they would talk about is how they left the islands.  And, they left the islands because, not that they didn't love the island, which they did, but economically in turns of jobs and educational opportunities, it was very limited after you completed high school.  And, so, the majority of my family spent their time migrating to New York City [New York, New York].  And, then moving out of different parts of the United States.  So, I had huge clusters of family that lived in the Bronx [New York], Harlem [New York, New York], Brooklyn [New York], and then later out to Queens [New York].
Speaker 1: So, they were in all five boroughs (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They were in all five boroughs.  When I got married, my husband [O'Neill T. Hammond] said, my family propagated like bunnies.  We never sent an invitation and we just sent out word that I was getting married and three hundred people showed up (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's a significant group of relatives.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  Because my [maternal] great-grandmother had something like, out of all the children, she had, she had five girls and three boys.  And, so, all we did was tell the sisters, all right; the matriarchs.  And, each one of them told their clans, and that's how everyone showed up.  I wrote letters of invitations to my senior aunts, all my elder aunts.  Those were the only form of invitations I sent.  And, I told them, because I was in grad school [Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland]  at the time, and I told them I could not afford, you know, invitation or all of the proper circumstance 'cause I wasn't really that crazy about weddings and all that other stuff.  I was busy doing research.  But, we would have this wedding.  So, tell the family to come.
Story_ID: 434945
Speaker 1: Are there any stories about interactions with African Americans when--you only read in these plays by Wallace Thurman and other, you know, literature at the time, you know, a little bit of friction between African Americans and West Indies in New York [New York].  West Indies usually being a little bit better educated as, you know, those supposedly at the same level of education (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.
Speaker 1: You know, a high school education there being so much more than it is here.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Any stories about that?
Speaker 2: Well, there, there are, there are some kind of vignettes that are very telling.  One, I was brought up in a very, as my brother [Oliver King, Jr.] calls it, island ethnic community, or a Caribbean-focused community with friends and family who were from the islands.  And, there was a cliquishness among Caribbean families as I was growing up where they protected their own culture interest.  So, what they did was instead of talking about what happened on the island, often times they invariably replicated it within the communities that they lived, and within the family events that occurred over the years.  One of the things that I thought was fascinating was when I did finally start to go to Barbados, 'cause I was curious.  I wanted to go to the island.  I wanted to see the culture.  I wanted to feel the space that they came up from because they all talked with the wonderful lilt, this patois, and they--my [maternal] grandmother [Ottalie Adalese Maxwell] would not give it up.  And--
Speaker 1: Can you, can you do it?
Speaker 2: No.  I won't do it because I won't, I won't do it with the same passion and flare.  Now, when I'm with them, every now and then when people are talking, I can drop into it.  And, I may drop in at some time.  But, no, I just, you know, I don't, I don't double voice that language.  But, I do remember an occasion where I went to get a cab and this gentleman obviously, he had white shirt and he had on his pants, and he was very proper.  Because everybody in Barbados is more English than the English.  And, he was driving along and I asked him to wait for me.  And, he said, "Yes, I have my newspaper."  And, I said, "Oh," I said, "is it today's?"  He says, "No, no, no, no, no, I cannot 'ford, I cannot 'ford.  I will read this newspaper, okay, front to back and then I will pass it on."  And, then he went into a little litany and he says, "Do you know everybody on the island of Barbados, 94 percent, 94 percent of us can read.  The highest in the Caribbean, the highest in the Caribbean."  And, I thought that was such a telling, telling statement, okay.  And, and the island's motto, I believe, is, Industry and Pride [sic. Pride and Industry], all right.  And, they have a high concentration on the legacy of being able to read and leaving the island with that kind of capability and skill.  And, when I heard that, and this was after my first trip to the island, it started to make a lot sense in my own upbringing.  Why my family was so insistent upon a sound education, doing the absolute best that you could possibly do and accepting nothing less than that.  And, so, that was, that was a standard expectation to the degree that by the time my generation came along, unlike my parents' [Evelyne Maxwell King and Oliver King, Sr.] generation, it was a foregoing conclusion that you, you're in the United States, you were going, you were going to college, period.  There was no discussion.  It was just the next step in the evolution of your education.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, the proper term for somebody from Barbados is a Bajan [sic.]?  Is that right?
Speaker 2: A Badian.
Speaker 1: Badian, okay.  How do spell that?
Speaker 2: B-A-D-I-A-N.
Story_ID: 434946
Speaker 1: Did you mother [Evelyne Maxwell King] talk about growing up and what it like for her to grow up in New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My mother would occasionally talk about it.  And, she was not comfortable with it.  There were serious issues of poverty because she was sent back [to Barbados].  She was part, you know, like African Americans would send their family, their children back to the South to the grandmother, to be raised.  Well, Caribbean people, Badians, were no different; Jamaicans were no different, same kids.  Anybody who came to the United States and school was out or the children were too young, or as in the case of my father [Oliver King, Sr.], which I'll talk about later, he was orphaned at an early age.  The children were always sent back to the island to be raised by the grandparents, or relatives, or in some cases, orphanages.  So, my mother would talk about those times.  And, how they had very little material resources even though they were very resourceful with everything that they could get their hands on and could use.  This was one of the difficulties of living on an island.  And, I remember one day asking her about her feet because she had many corns and bunions.  And, she said, "That's because I could never get the proper size shoes."  And, my father, my grandfather [Clifford Maxwell, Sr.], her father, was also a merchant marine and he would travel abroad and he would bring back shoes.  And, he would be so proud that he had brought back these shoes and he'd say, "Put these shoes on."  And, she put the shoes on, and the shoes wouldn't fit.  And, then he would make her wear the shoes because he had brought the shoes back.  So, there were these kind of dogmas that were very uncomfortable for her to deal with.  And, very physically painful and in memory, painful.  So, it was hard getting information from my family about living under those conditions.  Because life, you know, on an island is pictured in tourist terms and it's supposed to be, you know, very beautiful and lush and, you know, visually, yes.  But, when it comes to the daily routine of living, no, it's, it's not an easy life.  It was not an easy life for them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I guess my definition of the island does have limited resources because you can't--you're--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  Everything has to be imported.  Unless, you know, you're depending on the natural resources of the island to produce, you know, coconuts, and mangos, and avocados, you understand and grapefruit, and flying fish, and all of that good stuff, and peas and rice, you understand.  But, even so, the rice has to be imported, all right.  And, they don't grow the peas there and so they have 'em in cans, you understand.  And, sometimes, you know, if there's an embargo or there's a shortage, or you know, there--whatever politics are going on in the world, if there's a world war, it stops.
Speaker 1: So, your mother would go during the summer?  Or, did she ever go for long (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, at times she would, she would stay there for years.  And, I--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Think she was sent back and she grew up in the islands until she was like around high school age.  And, then she came back because--to the United States, because my grandmother [Ottalie Adalese Maxwell] by then had procured a job in the Garment District [New York, New York] as a seamstress.  And, many, on the island of Barbados, the educational system was geared towards teaching women the skills of sowing and crocheting and knitting and tatting and those things.  Young men were taught carpentry.  So, everybody had, quote, unquote, a skill.  And, so, when my grandmother migrated to the United States, obviously one of the areas of greatest needs was the Garment District.  And, so, she went to work on 7th Avenue, where she worked for nearly forty years.  And, moved to Brooklyn [New York], and started a family and then she had children.  They were sent back to live with my [maternal] great-grandmother until she was financially in a better position because her husband, my grandfather, were also a merchant marine.  For black males in the islands, merchant marines were the, I guess, creme de la creme for black males, for African American males at that time.  And, he too traveled the world.  So, he was away from home a lot.
Story_ID: 434947
Speaker 1: Your mother [Evelyne Maxwell King], she, I take it she finished high school and attended college as well (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.  She, she finished high school and then she went to Lincoln college [Lincoln School for Nurses, New York, New York], nursing college and became a nurse.
Speaker 1: That's in Pennsylvania?
Speaker 2: No.  That's in New York City [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Oh, Lincoln nursing college.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: It was a college geared for African American women.  And, produced some of the finest nurses in its day.  I think it became--sometime in the '60s [1960s] these schools stopped offering courses because then they were beginning to have more integration and African American women could go to Columbia [Columbia University School of Nursing, New York, New York] and all of the other medical schools where they had nursing schools.  But, my mother was part of a large cadre of African American nurses who emerged in the New York City area and populated the hospitals throughout boroughs.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what hospital she worked in?
Speaker 2: Well, she, for a while, she became the head of the emergency room at, I think it was Jamaica Hospital [Jamaica Hospital Medical Center] in Queens [New York].  And, then she worked Hillcrest [Hillcrest General Hospital, Queens, New York].  And, then she was a cardiac specialist nurse.  And, I think my mother's real passion and forte would have been, had all things been considered, she would have made a very fine doctor.  She was great diagnostically.  She was always pinpointing what was wrong with us.  We weren't sick but a nanosecond before she had something to fix it, or she knew what to do.  Or, when it was time to really move out and take some, you know, proactive measures.  But, she was really excellent in that, in that area.
Story_ID: 434948
Speaker 1: This is--just occurred to me, I never asked this question before.  But, is there a historical, I guess, relationship between Queens [New York] and, and Jamaica?  I mean, the name Jamaica Queens, and you got, and a lot of people from the Caribbean live in that area.  I was wondering if there, if it goes all the way back to the colonial period, or something?
Speaker 2: I have no idea.  I mean, I used to know, but I sort of lost track of that history, of that relationship between Jamaica as a sight.  I do know that Queens has a unique history like Harlem [New York, New York].  In that, the part of Queens we ultimately settled into as a family became also part of the area where lots of jazz musicians and upperly mobile African American middle class began to move.  So, I lived in the community right next door and when I moved out to Queens finally--first I lived in South Jamaica [Queens, New York], then I moved over to Hollis [Queens, New York].  And, in between those two communities there was, and this is all (air quotes) Jamaica as they call it, it was St. Albans [Queens, New York].  And, in St. Albans, Louis Armstrong, the MJQ [Modern Jazz Quartet], John Coltrane, Arthur Prysock used to come and play.  Alice Coltrane, all of the best, the great--James Brown had one of the most extraordinary houses with a moat around it, and water, and a huge awning that went across the front door.  I mean, so, it became one of the first enclaves of cultural wealth.  And, really dynamic with leaderships. Count Basie had a home.  So, that you knew if there was a party going on and you were invited to it that was a really special thing.
Story_ID: 434949
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's full name is Oliver Curtiss, with two S's on the end, King, K-I-N-G [Oliver King, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He's circa around 1914 also.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'll get you those exact dates.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Harlem, New York [New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what do you know about his ancestors?
Speaker 2: Well, let's put it this way.  At an early age, he was orphaned.  My great--my grandmother died.  And, he and his three sisters were sent back to Barbados to be raised in a Catholic orphanage while my grandfather [Avelyn King] worked.  And, I don't know what my grandfather did.  I can't remember right now.  But, I know, that side, he was not a merchant marine.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, my ancestors on that side, very little information, again.  Because at that point in time, most of them were in the throes of migrating from the island.  They were leaving the island.  They were trying to find ways to get to the United States so that they could have jobs, education, homes, property, businesses, anything that would help them to have a better life than what they were living.  Or, what was capable or available for them on the island.
Speaker 1: It's interesting, you, so, we have a people with better than, way better than average education--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: You know, on an island with very little opportunity.
Speaker 2: Have very little opportunity to take that education and advance to do anything else.  They were, as I remember from both sides of the family, there was always this frustration that as young adults, they could not do more with their intellect.  They were very much aware of the world.  And, they were very protective of us because there was a kind of edgy schism between black from the South and Caribbean.  Caribbean's had attitude.  And, now my father would tell me stories about how when he came back from the islands after having lived in the orphanage for many years, that he and his sisters were the target of ridicule.  And, they were called monkey people in their neighborhood in Harlem.  And, the kids used to throw things at them and just be mean and bully-ish and all of those things to the different kid in the neighborhood or the one who talks strangely.  So, they were always hypersensitive about who they were.  Also, to my father's family, were light-skinned.  And, they were light-skinned to the degree that some of them even had light eyes.  And, this also caused quite a bit of difficulty because it, it left an illusion of privilege for lighter-skinned black, you know.  It didn't matter if you were from the South or Harlem, or from the islands, you know.  The class caste system, that game was played everywhere.  And, so, they took a lot of abuses and they took a lot of grief for being basically just working class people just trying to get ahead.  Because that's my history and my history is nothing but working class family members.  That's not to say that, eventually, my generation, we did not move into highly professionalized positions, you understand, of achievement.  But, for my parents and their peers at that time, those opportunities were not available; not on the island of Barbados and certainly not in the United States.
Story_ID: 434950
Speaker 1: I think we were discussing before we started the interview that your father [Oliver King, Sr.] or his side of the family were involved with the Universal Negro Improvement Association.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Which sought to remedy this schism by united in one body the 400 million--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --Negroes of the world.
Speaker 2: My father, my father never spoke directly about being a member of the movement.  What he spoke about was what the movement gave him.  Which let me know that, yes, as a young man he was marching.  I know he was marching.  I know that he was a Garveyite.  Because his politics as I began to grow and read and understand the history of how Garvey's [Marcus Garvey] impact on American, especially in New York [New York], was so profound that my father was absolutely in league with this kind of independence of thought.  Because it was also consistent with the values that he grew up with.  And, also to, because quiet as it was kept, it was a cliquishness and the snobbishness among Caribbean people.  And, Garvey was from Jamaica.  And, so, he was highly regarded.  Elocution and diction and oratory, we were always demanded in the house to speak properly, you know.  Aside from the fact that, you know, we were a colonized nation by England, and we had to speak the King's English.  Whether we spoke it with a patois or a lilt, you had be articulate.  Whether you sang it in a calypso or you spoke it out.  You had to be clear.  You were not allowed to drop your syllables or participles or slip your tenses.  That was unforgiveable.
Story_ID: 434951
Speaker 1: Your father [Oliver King, Sr.] was basically raised in Barbados and then he comes to--?
Speaker 2: He comes to the United States.
Speaker 1: When he's a, is he a teenager by the time he comes?
Speaker 2: He's a teenager by then.  He too is approaching high school age.  And, he's finishing school and he's working in my uncle's liquor store.  And, then as he finishes high school, he then becomes employed by the Brooklyn Navy Yard [New York, New York].  And, he becomes what is known as a ship fitter.  Which means that he was the one responsible for taking the huge components of the ships battleships, submarines, aircraft carriers.  And, and he would be the welder who would take these huge molten bolts and connect these bows and these, you know, masts, and whatever it was, he was the one that, you know, he's the one that took the puzzle and put it together.  So, sometimes he would come home and he would have burns on him because they would throw the bolts, these molten bolts.  And, he would have to catch them in his funnel.  And, one day he was laughing, he said, "I missed," and the bolt hit him down his arm and so he came home with these burns that were, you know, bouncing burn marks down his arm.  Which showed you the danger of what he was doing because he had to work in a sling.  Okay, he was slung high on a mast.  And, he would reach his arm out with a funnel and catch the bolt, molten bolts, all right.  And, then he would take the bolts and then slip them into the (unclear) and then would hammer; weld them into place.  So, my father was very strong.  And, he was also trained as a master carpenter on the island of Barbados.  So, he could built anything.  Once my mother [Evelyne Maxwell King] asked him to build a grape barber just to support the plants, the shrubs.  And, when it was finished it looked like a boat.  She said, "I didn't mean for you to rebuild--."  It lasted for nearly forty years.  It was so well built.  But, that's just the way he was.
Story_ID: 434952
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents [Evelyne Maxwell King and Oliver King, Sr.] met?
Speaker 2: My parents met because they were introduced by friends.  It was just that simple.  Again, a Caribbean community, my father's best friends knew my mother, I believe from high school, and introduce them and the rest was history.
Speaker 1: Okay. When you, when you think about your parents' personalities and talents in such, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I, at points, I have to say probably 70 percent is my father, no, it's 50/50 because here's how it breaks out.  My mother's side are made up of seamstresses and nurses.  So, they're caretakers and they're makers.  And, a lot of what I do with my own artwork reflects on that.  The other side is my father because my father was a builder.  And, ironically, when we were growing up, my brother [Oliver King, Jr.] never liked making things with my father.  Meaning, when my father was building a part of the house or refinishing the basement or something, I was the one helping him lift the sheetrock.  I loved building.  I loved making.  I loved sowing.  I loved--I would just, I would be really having a bad day and you know how your mother gives you time out?  Well, I would go to (unclear) sent to my room.  And, I would be, it would be a joyful experience for me because underneath my bed I had a cigar box, an old cigar box that my father had given me.  And, I'd pull out the cigar box and there would be all my stuff, and I would make.  Just scraps.  And, it would be all scraps, I didn't have any professional art materials.  But, my father was extremely instrumental in always allowing me as a girl to do things with him that we usually relegated for boys only.  He thought I was kind of nutty.  But, he never begrudged me.  He would say, "I'm gonna be," you know, "finishing this part of the basement.  Or, I have to go out and repair part of the fencing."  And, I'd say, "Oh, can I help?"  "Okay."  And, I would come with the tools and the nails or the hammers or saws or whatever.  But, I was fascinated with the process.  My [maternal] grandmother [Ottalie Adalese Maxwell] was the same way.  She was a master seamstress and I used to be awed.  I would sit next to her while she sewed at the machine.  And, I could never figure out how she took all of those little pieces, put them together like a puzzle and she would make something so awesome.  She would make my clothes.  Later on, I would make all the clothes for the family.  Now, my mother had an interesting relationship there because she was a, a masterful cook.  Oh, my God.  She could, as my nephew say, "She could throw down."  And, I learned to cook.  And, I also learned from my mother and my grandmother how herbs and medicines can heal.  And, so I became, I became very fascinated with the herbology of the Caribbean islands.  And, what did they do when they didn't have medicines?  Which a lot of times they didn't.  And, would ask my mother and my grandmother, "What did you do?"  You know, my grandmother, I inherited terrible allergies from her.  And, you know, how it skips a generation, well my mother didn't have the allergies but I did.  And so I began to learn from the two of them.  So I'm, I'm really a split.  I'm, you know, I'm a fusion.  I'm a fusion baby.  I take everything from everybody.

Speaker 1: Now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My mother [Evelyne Maxwell King] swore I couldn't be right.  But, yes, I do.  And, I remember my earliest childhood memory was being in what was probably a crib and there were balloons all around.  Color, I saw color.  At the time I didn't know they were balloons.  I saw spots of color around me.  And, my mother would say, "You couldn't remember that."  And, I said, "I do.  I remember this space that I was in."  You know, and it was, it's blurry 'cause, you know, you're little.  And, the incident that I was recalling, I, I had to be around eleven months old.  And, I had had some major surgery.  I'd been very ill.  By today's standards I probably should've been dead.  But, they discovered I had a tumor in my head and my eye.  And, I had to have this radical surgery.  It was probably a baby cancer.  And, I was in a hospital and the irony was is that, the hospital I was in was one of the hospitals where my mother had training.  And, so, all of her girlfriends and my aunts were my nurses.  And, they were all so upset that I was so near death that to make me feel better, they put these balloons around.  And, she said, "No, no, we told you that."  And, I went, "Naw, I remember seeing that.  I saw it."  I see this space.  I see this space.  I see blurry faces; a few, you know, and then I see the colors.  And, the colors, the only thing it could've been was the balloons around my bed.  So, that was my earliest childhood memory.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's a good one.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 434954
Speaker 1: How many brothers and sisters do you have?  Or, do you have any?
Speaker 2: I have one brother [Oliver King, Jr.] who is right under me and then I had two other sisters [Robin King and Tracey King], I have two sisters who are ten and eleven years younger than me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm the oldest.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so, you and your brother were basically raised together then?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My brother and I were raised together under the same culture.  And, now we realize, you know, ten years is a big difference.  And, my two younger sisters were raised together.  Basically, I sort of raised them because my mother [Evelyne Maxwell King] went back to work and she worked the graveyard shift.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, it was my job to get everybody in the bed, or fix, help fix dinner, all of that stuff.
Story_ID: 434955
Speaker 1: Can you describe your, the neighborhood--did you grow up in the same neighborhood, the whole time?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I stayed in the same neighborhood from high school [Andrew Jackson High School, Queens, New York] through college [Queens College, Queens, New York]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Until grad school [Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 1: Well, what was some of the sights, and sounds, and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, the sights and sounds of growing up for me were focused largely on family events.  Family events that constituted weddings, christenings, birthday parties, funerals.  They were hugely popular.  I had lots of cousins, to the degree that we called ourselves, the cousins, like we were club or a gang.  And, I had a lot of boy cousins and I was one of the few girls.  And, it was rough and tumble, and huge, huge laughs.  So, that every time a family event came along, the family gatherings would split between the uncle, the aunts, the elders, and all the cousins just running wild.  Then we grew up like that.  The other things that as also very memorable about growing up in New York [New York] was that in the summer months, we had a ritual, our family.  Where my father [Oliver King, Sr.] would pack us up on Saturdays and Sundays and take us to the beach.  And, we would go to Rockaway Park [Queens, New York], or Riis Park [Jacob Riis Park, New York, New York], or out to Shinnecock Bay because we had family that lived out on the island.  And, we lived on the beach just like it was the Caribbean.  And, we learned at an early age.  We had standard picnic baskets, blankets, towels, and we would fill the car with as many cousins whose parents had to work, maybe that weekend.  And, we would go and we would get to the beach, oh god, nine o'clock, eight o'clock in the morning because the beaches would be so full.  To get a good spot, you would have to get there early.  And, as we became teenagers, we start partying all night.  We would stay up all night and then we would pack up, my mother [Evelyne Maxwell King] packed up in the morning when we came in from partying.  We never went to bed.  And, then we would go to the beach.  We would sleep until maybe noon or one o'clock, or two o'clock, when everybody else would arrive and all of the partying would happen.  So, and we did this, oh my God, I can remember this going on from when I was like, five or six years old up until I started college.  We just, this was, that was the, the ritual every Sunday, we pa- weather permitting.  Even if it rain sometimes and it was projected to be better that day, we'd still head out to the beach.  And, then in the winter, it didn't stop because my father had this passion for going to the beach in the winter.  And, he would take the, just the kids, my mother never came.  She never liked this part of the beach.  But, we began to love the beach in the winter.  And, he would find driftwood and, we would pull it all together and, he would make fires on the beach.  And, we would sit there and running around, chase the seagulls, and play and sit and talk and laugh.  And, then we would go home smelling like burnt wood.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, so, that's, yeah that's interesting.
Speaker 2: And, the beach was only, the beach couldn't've been more than twenty minutes from the house.  Because people forget that New York City, all the boroughs are situated in between all kinds of waterfronts and waterbodies.  And, so, getting to a beach was nothing.  It's your choice.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  What was the name of the particular beaches you would go to?
Speaker 2: Oh, we'd go to Rockaway Beach [Queens, New York].
Speaker 1: Rockaway, okay.
Speaker 2: Jones Beach [Jones Beach State Park, Wantagh, New York], that was another one of our favorite beaches; Riis Park.  Sometimes we'd go upstate to Bear Mountain [Bear Mountain State Park, New York], take a different trip, or we'd go out to Shinnecock Bay out on Long Island [New York].
Story_ID: 434956
Speaker 1: You said you liked to fix things and do things with your hands.  You could sew.  And, now, did you like school when you started?
Speaker 2: No.  I hated school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I hated school because I learned very quickly how racist the systems were.  And, I learned very quickly that no matter what you did, if there was a teacher in front of the classroom who already had a preconditioned attitude or disposition of negative attitudes towards you, that it didn't matter how much you did, you were not going to be able to succeed.  So, I hated having to go to school under those conditions.  And, I think it sort of crystalized for me when I was in the fifth grade.  That's not to say all my teachers were bad and I hated everyone them.  But, by in large, the majority of them were so disaffected by the period of history.  But, I remember having a German teacher once and she lost her pen.  And, accused the class of stealing her pen.  And, she would not relent until somebody gave her back her pen, because she was sure.  This was an all-black class because I went to an all-black school.  She was sure one of us had stolen the pen.  And, basically, she had lost the pen in her locker.  And, she penalized us that day, something really trite but I thought that it was really an unfair--and I say something to her about it.  I said, "Are you sure you have not lost the pen?  Are you sure you did not check?"  And, she was livid with me.  But, I was livid with her for having made such an open accusation.  And, so, I just, you know, by the time that was about fifth, sixth grade.  So, by the time I got to middle school, I had already figured out what the game was.  And the turning point was when I was in a history class, and the history teacher turned out to be my cousin.  Damn!  And, she was so annoyed with me.  And, she would come home, in those days the teacher could come home.  Whether they were your cousin or not, all right.  She came to my mother [Evelyne Maxwell King] and she said, "She's just not doing well in class.  And, she just won't try hard.  She'll get to a C--almost to a B and she just won't go any further."  And, she said, "I can't seem to motivate her.  I can't--," she said, "I know she knows.  I know she's smart, (unclear)."  And, so, my mother said, "Why don't you try?"  And, I said, "I'm just, you know, I'll try, I'll try."  And basically, my attitude was to get a grade that would at least marginally satisfy my parents, just to shut 'em up, because I didn't like dealing with the politics.
Story_ID: 434957
Speaker 1: Part of this also was around the time where I sort of had this awakening where I had been walking to school one day and I stopped at the corner.  And, I looked up at the lamp post and I saw this poster.  And, I was trying to wrap my brain around this image that I saw on this poster and what it was trying to say.  And, I could read, but I couldn't focus on the text because the picture was so riveting.  And, I never told my parents [Evelyne Maxwell King and Oliver King, Sr.] about this moment that I had on the corner.  And, later on what I had witness was the poster of the photograph of Emmett Till in open casket that had been placed on the telephone poles in the community, all-black communities, probably throughout the country wherever they could get away from it.  And, I carried that because that burden, because I didn't know who to talk to it about it.  But, it, it confirmed for me in my mind the horrendous state that the country was in.  And, so, I, I just, I just sort of insulated myself and used my creativity, my artistry, and my insecurity about my blindness, because I was partial blind as a result of the, the, the surgery as an infant.  I used that as a cover, a foil, so that I wouldn't have to deal with the rest of the world, who, one, didn't like me because I was colored.  I couldn't do anything because I was a girl, all right.  I was always told my brother [Oliver King, Jr.] could do things that I couldn't do because I was a girl and ladies couldn't do that.  And, then three, because I had these challenges or these handicaps and everybody was like hypersensitive about me hurting myself further.  So, I was really kind of like pissed off at the world (laughter).  So, school was like my payback to everybody else, like, "Oh, that's what you want?"  You know, the very thing that you want me to do is the very thing that's causing me so much agony.  So, as I finished college [Queens College, Queens, New York] and I decided to go on and get a doctorate [at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland], everybody in the family drops to the floor, like, "But, you're the one that hated school.  How could do this?"
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And, I went (shrugs shoulders).
Story_ID: 434958
Speaker 1: What was the first, name of your first school?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't remember that school.  It was a little elementary school in South Jamaica, Queens [New York].  I probably could hunt it up, but--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: P.S. 109, 107.  Naw, I think it was P.S. 104 [The Bays Water School, Queens, New York].  I think it was P.S. 104.  I remember all the others.  But, that one was like sort of a blur.
Speaker 1: Now, were all these schools integrated schools?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, integrated but they had a large number of African Americans--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In the area because Queens was quickly becoming the new enclave outside of Harlem [New York, New York] and outside of East New York in Brooklyn [New York].  East New York was a part of Brooklyn, community in Brooklyn where Caribbean and some families, black southern families settled.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: My junior high school was Shimer Junior High School [P.S. 142, Shimer Junior High School, Queens, New York].  I'm never forget that school.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: S-H-I-M-E-R, Junior High School.  That was just hormone hell.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, you know, you're in the auditorium and little boys get into issues and they jump up and they start punching each other out.  And, girls are screaming and, you know, it's a hormone, it's hormonal hell, that's all it was.  Everyday something was going on.  And, then I went to Andrew Jackson High School [Queens, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Andrew Jackson High School.  And, there even though it was an overpopulated school, and I took classes like from 7:30 in the morning and was finished at 1:30 in the afternoon because I was on, they were on three cycles.  That was a school where I got to enjoy some kind of artistic and culture--so, I, Andrew Jackson was wonderful because they had what they called a interschool competition called a sing, S-I-N-G.  And, we would all get our fathers' old shirts and dye them.  And, the seniors would dye theirs one color, and the juniors would dye another color, and the sophomores and the freshman.  And, we would take the musical scores from major plays and theatre groups, and add our own words to it.  And, then we would all sit on the stage and we would have a shoebox in our laps.  And, we would have different costume changes and it was like, you know, Busby Berkeley in the '60s [1960s], you know, out of a shoebox and all of your father's old dyed shirt.  And, it was just absolutely the most joyous fun thing that I can remember out of that whole high school experience 'cause I can't remember one person's name that I was in school with.  I didn't care.  I just wanted to deal with the art.  If I couldn't draw or paint or make stuff, I would sing, and I couldn't sing (laughter).
Story_ID: 434959
Speaker 1: When did you discover your artistic talent?
Speaker 2: Oh, I, I knew early on that I was, I had a predisposition for art, that I, that I loved to make things.  That I just was impassioned with art.  I was also extremely curious which I think made my mother [Evelyne Maxwell King] uncomfortable about the whole idea of how does an artist become an artist.  Because I was also impassioned with the fact that my childhood was not normal because periodically I would have to have eyes made for me.  And, so, when I was growing up, I had to go to a glass blowers which was a very old world tradition.  Now they make them out of synthetics and plastics and whatever.  But, at the time, I would have to sit with this, this master who would literally blow these glass bubbles.  And, I can remember vividly being so mesmerized by the process of how he would craft from this bubble of molten glass, this incredible delicate eye that I would have to wear.  You know, I didn't really care that I was wearing an artificial eye.  I just wanted to go and watch him make eyes, okay.  I was just curious.  And, so, I would ask my mother questions like, "How did he learn to do that?"  Or, "Are people with handicaps and challenges more predisposed to have these artistic talents?"  And, since she was in medicine, it was kind of disconcerting for her, her to have to answer these kinds of questions 'cause she hadn't thought about it in that way because she was being the overprotective mother.  But, as I began to increasingly read, because she would get nursing journals and medical journals just to keep up with the field, so I would read them.  And, I would find the articles and variably about research that was done on people with different kinds of challenges and how, what happens with the body when one area is compromised the other area, another area will compensate.  Well, that's that left brain, right brain thing.  And, so what happens is, is that, you know, the left brain which organizes and keeps everything structurally in place, you understand, when it gets damaged or that sector of the body get damaged it responds to the left brain.  This right brain thing kicks in and you have this enormous capacity that begins to compensate for the loss that's on the left side.  And, I began to understand it more when I finally went to college [Queens College, Queens, New York] and I had a professor, a painting professor, who explained to me exactly what was happening.  Because at one point I went to him because I was taking color theory class and he was making us go through various exercises of color compass- comparisons and intensities.  And, I went to him, not knowing, because it had not been explained to me, and I said to him, "I have singular vision and I'm not sure that I'm gonna be able to respond to these problems."  And, he looked at me, he says, "I know."  And, I said, "How do you know?"  He said, "Because you're the only one in the class who can really see what I'm teaching."  He said, "Because you have singular vision," he said, "your depth perception cannot be based on a black to white to grey scale."  He says, "You have to use color."  He says, "You've been using color for so long to measure distances."  That means, how to step up on a high plane.  How to navigate through shadows.  He said, he says, "You're so ultra-sensitive to color," he says, "every problem you do," he say, "you can't fail because you've already mastered it unconsciously."  He said, "This is the first time, you've probably been able to talk about it with somebody who understands the dynamics of it."  After that, it was like, bam (claps hands), somebody finally told me, broke the key, the magic box was open, I went "Yes, okay, (makes noise)."  And, after I got that piece of information I could, you know, I was, I was cool.  I was just cool.
Story_ID: 434960
Speaker 1: How did you family react to your artwork?  What was--?
Speaker 2: Basically, anybody who went into art at that point in history and that point of time, they were of, you know, of African, black, Caribbean descent, was with great trepidation because there was no belief.  And, there were just no evidence in society at that time that you could make a livelihood out of this.  It was a respected skill.  It was a respected achievement.  But, the question was always gonna be, what, what are really gonna do?  What kind of real job are you gonna have?  Okay.  What, what are you gonna really do with your life?  Okay.  So, if I was going to pursue this art thing, they had envisioned that I would be, you know, a teacher in a classroom in a public school.  Which I did for a little while, while I was finishing my undergraduate degree [at Queens College, Queens, New York].  I worked in an after school program.  But, basically, to be truthful, I didn't have a clue what I was gonna do with my art.
Story_ID: 434961
Speaker 1: We're talking about a time, when you were growing up, there were, Aaron Douglas was still alive and a lot of great black ar--Charles White [Charles Wilbert White] and other people doing things; Tom Feelings and--but, did you know of any black artists?
Speaker 2: While I was growing up, no.  I knew that there were some out there.  I couldn't find them because I was a consummate reader and I would go to the library.  And, I would ask the librarian relentlessly, "What kind of books do you have," do you understand.  And, there were very few books at that time, about our history.  And, so, what I did was is I started with the section on ancient Paleolithic art.  And, I read all the books.  And, then I went to folk art; no, not folk art, but I went to other folk cultural traditions.  And, then from there I went to mummies.  I got fascinated with mummies and bog people because the bog people in Northern Europe had just began to be discovered.  And, that was the first book I ever sent away for myself.  I ordered it myself, and had it sent to the house from a publisher, about the bog people.  And--
Speaker 1: These are the people in--
Speaker 2: Peat bogs.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: In Norway and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, well they, they pull of the remains of--intact almost.
Speaker 2: They're skins, everything is intact.
Speaker 1: The skins--
Speaker 2: In fact, their skin was almost our color because of the staining of the peat, of bog.  Yes.  And, their eyes, and their hair, and everything, their clothes because of the state of preservation of the bogs.
Speaker 1: Did you read National Geographic, in the libraries--?
Speaker 2: Oh, I read National Geographic.  I read Archeology.  I even ordered a subscription to Archeology.  And, I became so obsessed with archeology, because that's where my first passion I thought, professionally, would hopefully lead me, was that they used to have on the public television stations when they first started was something they called 'Sunrise Semester.'  And, at six o'clock in the morning they would have college courses, and they would have course on archeology.  And, I would get up before I went to school and listen to this class, taking notes.  And, when I had to be at school early, or I had to go on a field trip or something, I made my mother [Evelyne Maxwell King] take notes so I would not miss this information.  I was so fascinated with archeology, earth science, ancient civilizations, because I began to question, how do people evolve?  How do they become who they are?  And, where, where is the glitch?  Where is the fracture?  Where is the separation between them being humans and them being these heinous awful people?  And, this was globally.  Not just against black people because, you know, I, I would, I, I began to look at other cultures.  I began to look at Chinese literature, again, on the PBS [Public Broadcasting Service] stations at that time.  They began to have a series which again left a memorable impression on me.  'The Tales of Genji' ['The Tale of Genji,' Murasaki Shikibu], all right.  Which were, you know, like 'One Thousand and One Arabian Nights' ['One Thousand and One Nights'], only Japanese style, where they did it in tradition Japanese costume.  And, they told the stories of the ancient families and the conflict, you know.  So, I began to understand that, you know, people fight all over the world, don't matter what color they are.  It's just human condition.  And, I be--I saturated myself with books.  So, by the time I was in high school [Andrew Jackson High School, Queens, New York], I, I had bookshelves, tons of books.  And, and I was determined I wanted to be an archeologist and my--and I was painfully shy.
Story_ID: 434962
Speaker 1: That was the other thing I haven't told you.  By the time I was sixteen, I was, I wouldn't talk to anybody.  I wouldn't socialize with anybody.  At family affairs, playing with my cousins was one thing, other than that, I was an isolationist, a loner.  I just didn't deal with people.  My mother [Evelyne Maxwell King] put me in a Girl Scout troop [Girl Scouts of the United States of America], hoping to open me up, enlighten me, and bring me into the world because I was just so awkward.  I was so geeky, and I had skinny legs, and you have all of those adolescent insecurities.  And, while she was trying to feed me culturally, she had for two years, before she put me in the Girl Scout troop, they had put me in art school at Brooklyn Museum Art School in New York City [New York, New York].  And, my [maternal] uncle [Clifford Maxwell, Jr.] was--my godfather who was a concert pianist, he paid for the lessons.  And, I went there for two years.  And, I drew this self-portrait of which I found after decades, I couldn't believe it.  And, it, it was, it was a, that was a joyful period for me because I would go to these art classes on Saturday at the museum.  My father [Oliver King, Sr.] would drive me after having worked all night, and he would sleep in the car while I would take the, the classes.  And, I would do drawing and exercises, whatever they wanted.  And--but, but to show you the culture of the times, when I went to the first class, my mother was so excited that I got into this program, I had to be around, I guess 10, 11, 12 years old, the night before she made me take a bath.  And, she braided up my hair, I had long hair.  And, and she made me put on this dress the next day, and the white blouse, and a skirt and my little socks, and my Buster Browns.  I hated Buster Browns.  I used to wear Buster Browns, especially red Buster Browns.  I hated them.  And, I went off to class at the Brooklyn Museum and when I got back, I had a note from the teacher.  And, I gave it to my mother.  And, my mother just kind of dropped her head.  And, I said, "Well, what did the note say?"  And, she said, "The teacher said to let you come in your play clothes.  That you don't need to dress up."  And, that was a reaction to the time because, my mother wanted me to be seen as somebody who had been properly raised and who was prepared to take responsibility.  And, I was the only student, the only little girl that showed up in Sunday school clothes.
Speaker 2: Now last week we were in New York doing interviews and we drove passed the Brooklyn Museum [New York, New York], which I've had a chance to visit.  I don't think they can be--there aren't many museums in the country as the impressive as the Brooklyn Museum.  It's a huge--
Speaker 1: Awesome.
Speaker 2: --building.  You have the arch commemorating the end of World War, is it I [World War I, WWI] or II [World War II, WWII]?
Speaker 1: I think it's I.
Speaker 2: One, yeah.
Speaker 1: It's that early.
Speaker 2: It's as big as the Arc de Triomphe [Arc de Triomphe] in Paris [France].  And, then there's this huge museum with acres, I think recently they just discovered Egyptian collection in the basement.  They didn't know it was there, and they put it on display.  But, they, you know, this huge place.  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Plus it shares the campus with the botanical gardens [Brooklyn Botanic Garden, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: 'Cause we would go out into the botanical gardens and draw.
Speaker 2: So, had you been there before, before you enrolled?
Speaker 1: I had never been to the Brooklyn Museum.  I had driven past it.  My father would drive pass it on the way to my [maternal] grandmother's [Ottalie Adalese Maxwell] house or if we were going to another relative's house.  And, it was, it was a very prestigious program.  And, for children to get into the Saturday program, you had to be on line very early.
Story_ID: 434963
Speaker 1: And, so, my [maternal] uncle, one year when they decided, because in order to (air quotes) give me culture, my uncle who was concert pianist would give us piano lessons.  And, I hated piano.
Speaker 2: Now, what's you uncle's name?
Speaker 1: Clifford Maxwell [Clifford Maxwell, Jr.].  And, after World War II [WWII], he went over on the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944] to study at the Sorbonne [University of Paris, Paris, France], and he became a classical pianist.  And, spent the rest of his life working as the choir master and organ master for St. Barnabas Church in Brooklyn [St. Barnabas Episcopal Church, Brooklyn, New York].  And, so, he was--
Speaker 2: Is that an Episcopal church or (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes.  High Episcopal--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That's what I thought.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, he was our piano teacher for years.  And, I was insufferable.  I was just awful.  And, finally, he said to my mother [Evelyne Maxwell King], he says, "She just has absolutely no interest in music."  I had no aptitude, no interest, whatever.  So, one day they were, you know, they were watching--I had won a little poster competition when I was in the third grade.  And, I was always, you know, busy making something.  And, so, my uncle said, to my mother, "They have this program at the Brooklyn Museum [Brooklyn Museum Art School, New York, New York]," he says, "Why don't I see if I can get her in that."  And, that's what they did.  They got me in that program.  And, I was just, I was ecstatic.  I was a happy camper.

Speaker 1: Now, there's a photo that you brought with you today of yourself, with your self-portrait.
Speaker 2: That's it.
Speaker 1: It's a fascinating kind of a picture.
Speaker 2: That's the portrait.
Speaker 1: So, big, I guess, big art paper--
Speaker 2: It was a big twenty-four by eighteen inch pad.  And, that day the assignment was self-portraits, and I did this self-portrait.  And, I remember doing it and bring it home.  And, I hated it.  I just, well come on I'm hormonal, going into my adolescence.  There is not much when you're in adolescence that you really like about yourself at all.  I had no breasts.  I had skinny legs, you understand.  I had goofy eyes.  I wear these strange glasses, you know, I'm, I'm just, I'm a geekazoid, and so I thought.  I was a geekazoid.  So, you know, like, I'm like, when I look at this picture of myself and I go, "This is horrible."  And, so, for some uncanny reason, I bury it in my possessions for decades.  I, I don't look at that drawing, easily forty years, until I am asked by a colleague of mine to be in an exhibition at the Smithsonian [Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.].  And, I vehemently state, "No, I'm not being in the exhibition.  I haven't exhibited before.  I use my art to do my therapy.  I do it in my house.  It's--my private.  It's my salvation.  No."  So, one day I'm going through some, some papers, old papers and things and I am also busily writing.  I publish a lot of essays and catalogs.  And, I was having a problem writing because the period of history that I was writing about is the period of history I was in.  So, it's very hard to be objective about that when you're in the vortex of it.  And, I come, I'm going through these papers and I find this self-portrait.  So, I call my girlfriend up who's a curator, [HistoryMaker] Deborah Willis at the Smithsonian.  And, I say to her, "Deb guess what?"  She said, "What?"  I said, "I found the self-portrait.  Remember I told you about the self-portrait I did?"  I said, "I found this self-portrait in my old papers."  She just, she still didn't say anything.  She screams through the phone to her husband.  "Winston [Winston Kennedy], Leslie [HistoryMaker Leslie King-Hammond] found the painting."  He said, "Oh, no."  She said, "Yep, she in the show."  I said, "I'm not gonna be in the show."  Well, it was too late.  I was in the show and that picture was central.  And, so, when she brought the photographers to my house to take pictures of all of the work that was gonna be in the show, because I ended up being the only woman in this show.  I was standing next to it in my studio, next to that portrait, and I looked at it again and I went, "That really was me," (laughter).  "You, you really did capture that."  That was--and you were young, you understand, and you were just probably not able in wisdom or maturity to accept who you were.  I said, "But, you nailed it."  Okay.  For somebody that young, you nailed it.  Because, the irony is, is I critique my students all the time when they do their work.  And, then when this came up, I went, "We're coming full circle (laughter)."
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's quite a story.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 434965
Speaker 1: Well, when you were in high school [Andrew Jackson High School, Queens, New York], were you, did you still considered yourself for like a geekazoid sort of person (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes.  Oh, completely.  Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Did you--?
Speaker 2: I just, I was, I was in high school.  I was in Girl Scout troop [Girl Scouts of the United States of America].  And, I was feeling better about myself because my mother [Evelyne Maxwell King] put me in a Girl Scout troop with other young women who had similar skills and who were similarly awkward, but extremely bright.  And, I was the one in the troop that was responsible for all of the art projects.  So, I would lead the other girls in art projects.  But, the other thing that kept my geekazoid alive, my inner geek, that fed my inner geek, was that I still wouldn't give up the idea of becoming an architec- an archeologist.  And, so, my mother got the idea one day to call up the Museum of Natural History [American Museum of Natural History] in New York [New York] and she said, "Look, I have a daughter, she's colored, okay.  She's a little Negro girl.  She's in a Girl Scout troop and she thinks she wants to become an archeologist.  Now, I'm trying to give her experience but at the same time I don't want you to encourage her.  Do you have a job there that she could do?  You must not pay her.  Do not pay her.  Do you have a job at the museum that she could do?"  And, so, they passed my mother up through the ranks and my mother found herself talking to the head of the geology collection at the museum.  And, he said, "Well," he said, you know, "We have a job here which is kind of like a grunge job and it is basically taking the samples that are sent to us from all over the world.  And, taking those samples and putting them in the trays and in the categories in our storage areas."  He said, "If she would like to do that."  So, I said, "Yes."  And, after school, I would leave Queens [New York] and get on the subway and go to Manhattan [New York], and I would work for two or three hours for two or three times a week sorting geological samples.  And, when the drawers were full, the geologist would tell me, because I would be the only one left in the department by myself, they would tell me when you finish filling up the sample drawers, and if there was any, if there were any samples left, you can have 'em and take 'em home.  So, I was, I was in geek heaven (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, this is at the Natural History Museum in New York?
Speaker 2: Natural History Museum in New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Up on Central Park West and, what is that, 82nd Street.  And, I did that for two or three years, until I graduated from high school.
Speaker 1: Now, that museum, is that the one that has the temple in it, the Egyptian temple?
Speaker 2: No, no.  That's the Metropolitan Museum [Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, New York] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, that's Metropolitan Museum, okay.
Speaker 2: That's the one with the Rose Planetarium [Frederick Phineas and Sandra Priest Rose Center for Earth and Space, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's the one with the big planetarium in it.

Speaker 1: Did you get involved in any high school, I mean, in the school itself [Andrew Jackson High School, Queens, New York], any clubs or anything in the school?
Speaker 2: Only thing I did was to sing the choral competition.  Other than that, the school had forty-five hundred students for a building that was built for twenty-five hundred.  It was a WPA [Works Progress Administration; Work Projects Administration] design school and the only way you could be in school was to--the school had to be divided into three sessions.  And, soon as you--we had no lunch session.  I had to have lunch in my choral class.  There were no study halls.  You took all of your basic required courses and then you had to leave because the next shift was coming in.  So, I, I didn't get involved.  I didn't go to the prom.  I wasn't into proms.  I didn't believe in proms.  I didn't like that whole thing, and I would sew.
Speaker 1: What you say, you don't--you didn't believe in 'em.  What was it about the prom you (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, there was a lot of class issues around it.  With the Jack and Jill [Jack and Jill of America, Inc.], was one of the social groups that were very popular at the time.  And, they were very class oriented.  They were about, you know, how were your parents, and where you going and, you know, upperly mobile.  And, my, my family were working class.  My mother [Evelyne Maxwell King] was a nurse.  My father [Oliver King, Sr.] was a ship fitter.  It was, it was a different kind of culture for me.  And, I, I didn't have illusions, or delusions of grandeur about who or what I was.  Because I had, I felt enough challenges at that time just being female, you understand, 'cause I was angry long before the feminist movement came along about the innumerable things I couldn't do.  Or, I was not allowed to do, or were unladylike in terms of me engaging.  So, I really didn't like the status of my gender in society at that time.  I didn't like the status of my ethnicity at that time.  And, how opposition was constantly placed because also at that time, I began to be increasingly involved in Civil Rights Movement and picketing (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now--
Story_ID: 434967
Speaker 1: --Do you think at the time that most girls your age had a, you know, was that like a widely felt emotion that people kind of resented that, but they didn't really articulate it as much, or?
Speaker 2: They didn't articulate it at all.  And, many times, my, my self-imposed geekdom was doing pack to the--was due in fact to the reality that my peers were not similarly thinking about the same kind of aspirations for themselves.  They were worried about getting boyfriends and you know, and one day getting married, and getting bridal gowns and, and that was the last thing on my mind.  I, I was not interested in finishing school or going to college to find a man so that I could get married, so that I could have a family, and be in another man's house.  I was already in my father's [Oliver King, Sr.] house.  So, I was trying to figure out a way that I--what other kind of woman, what kind of human being could I be?  And, I remember vehement discussions and arguments with my mother [Evelyne Maxwell King] about my ladylike or unladylike behavior.  And, at one point, I told her, I said, "You know, I really understand that you're trying to give me the best of whatever it is that you as a mother want to impart to me.  But, being a lady to me, in this day, in this time, in this history, is not working for me."  I said, "How is it that I become a woman?  I wanna be a woman."  She said, "Well, that's, that's different."  Because to be a woman, you were kind of like bordering the edge somewhere between the other woman who might have been a prostitute, who might have been illicit, who might be so independent as to not have the sanction and protection of her community.  And, it was very scary for my mother.  It was very scary for my aunts.  And--to watch me go through this.  But, I had to say that I was compelled to be this way because I had been using my [maternal] grandmother [Ottalie Adalese Maxwell] and my father's sisters as my models.  Because I looked at them as being survivors in a time of overt, I mean, oppression for woman, and black people.  And, they were to me amazing successors that I wanted to pattern myself after.  They were outspoken.  They were caring.  They were loving.  They were consummate cooks and professionals.  One of my aunts was a policewoman.  Another one became a nurse.  Another one began to work in the corporate area for a major record company.  And, these, these women held themselves always with dignity.  But, they were never looked on as just girls or somebody's wife which is what I was not about.  I was not gonna be a girl.  I wasn't a girly girl.  I was not interested in become somebody's wife, or object or trophy.  I knew one day I wanted children, but, I was gonna do it in my time, my way, and that was scary for my mother and my father.
Story_ID: 434968
Speaker 1: Was church as big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, my God, yes.  Church was a huge part.  We went every Sunday, every Sunday to church Episcopalian church until two incidents happened.  One day, I was in high school [Andrew Jackson High School, Queens, New York] and, no, I was in college [Queens College, Queens, New York], I was in college.  We had gone go church and the minister for some reason that day was having a bad day.  And, he walked up and down the aisles, it was a white minister, white priest.  And, he began to have a meltdown about how he has problems too, which I agree, he's human.  And, that--and I'm sure somebody in the congregation, or somebodies pissed him off or ticked him off, and he let everybody in the congregation know that he had problems and he just didn't have time, all the time to deal with us.  Oh, this on a Sunday.  This was the Sunday sermon.  So, I sat there in church, I went, "Okay."  So, as irony would have it, the next morning my mother asked me to get up, go to the supermarket around the corner to get some bread so that we could make lunch for my sisters [Robin King and Tracey King] before we send them off to school and I have to go off to class.  I go into the supermarket and there are some of the congregants from that church, white, who were also in the supermarket buying stuff.  And, I get to the cash register and I, "Good morning," you know, "Mr. So-and-So, and Mrs. So-and-So."  No response.  So, I went, "Good morning."  No response.  When the nex- the day before as we were leaving the church, everybody was "How are you Leslie [HistoryMaker Leslie King-Hammond], and how are you, Ms. King [Evelyne Maxwell King]."  And, what--and I'm going, well what happened between yesterday and today that today I can't be recognized, okay.  So, the next Sunday comes, and I'm really, I'm really disturbed between the minister's performance and between these congregants who have just completely dismissed me, you know, while I'm buying bread and butter for the family.  And, my mother say, "Okay, it's Sunday morning, everybody get ready for church."  And, I said, "I'm not going to church today."  So, she, she didn't hear me, she ignored me, whatever.  She waited a while and did some other things, she came back.  She said, "Okay, everybody up, let's get ready for church."  I said, "I'm not going to church ever again."  And, she stopped and she looked at me, and I said, "I'm going to remind you that last Sunday that sermon, I did not appreciate.  I did not appreciate it the next day when I went to the supermarket and the very people who was supposed to show Christian love on the Sunday couldn't find any on the Monday morning."  I said, "I'm done with the hypocrisy of the church."  I said, "Now, if somebody passes or there's a wedding, I will certainly go."  I said, "But, as for this Sunday ritual, I'm done."  And, she never asked me again.  I was through.
Story_ID: 434969
Speaker 1: Once again, do you think that this is a feeling that's widely felt but never really articulated or hardly ever articulated?
Speaker 2: It's very hard to articulate when you're that age.  Because the family pressure, the peer pressure, the culture pressure to conform and to be protected by these institutions is so palpable that it, it, I think, takes some courage to step out or beyond that to take the risk to say, you know, "I'm just gonna do this by myself or the best way I can with whomever I can get to support."  But, I, there's something in my psyche that can't live with this lie anymore.  Or, I can't live with this untenable situation.  And, if I can't change it, I'm not gonna participate or be in collusion or contribute to it.  So, I began early, and, and it goes back to that Emmett Till thing.  I know it goes back to that.  I'm--if anybody ever ask, I, I go right--now, that I can say it and it can come out of my mouth.  And, it, it wasn't 'til I was a college professor that I told anybody that story.  I was in my forties before--and when I did it, I was on a panel with a whole bunch of other colleagues.  And, two of the philosophers came up to me afterwards and they said, "Do you realize you had an epiphany?"  'Cause the room got quiet when I told that story.  Because, you know, people want to forget about those incidents.  And, and we were talking about how I got to be in the career that I'm in.  And, I said, "The most unlikely incident that occurred to my life which was, you know, turned me irrevocably into this direction where I couldn't look back."  Because all I see is this image of this things which was really a human being of a young teenager, who was just a few years older than me when he passed, when he was murdered, all right.  And everybody is telling me all of these wondrous things to do to have a successful life, and I'm going, "But, all he did was whistle.  He just whistled."  And, and we can't even be sure that he really did whistle.  They said, he whistled.  And, look at him.  So, the disparity between those realities, I, I couldn't live with.  And, I figured that, you know, the strength in being a self-imposed geekazoid is that, you already know you're different.  So, you find strength, you understand, in your difference (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 430075
Speaker 1: On the verge of high school graduation [from Andrew Jackson High School, Queens, New York], what did you, you knew you were going to college, because of your family.  But--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, I knew I was going to college and, and as (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But, how, how did you choose a college?
Speaker 2: Well, I, the first colleges that I chose were (laughter) basically, how far away can I get from home?  (Laughter) You know.  You see the door or the gate is almost open and all you wanna do is bolt.  And, so, I picked the college that accepted me that was the furthest away from home.  And, I went Buffalo, University--State University of Buffalo [State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York].  And--
Speaker 1: You graduated in '62 [1962], is that it?
Speaker 2: Sixty-four [1964].
Speaker 1: Sixty-four [1964]?
Speaker 2: Sixty-four [1964].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I graduated in '64 [1964].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I find myself in Buffalo [New York].
Speaker 1: In SUNY Buffalo?
Speaker 2: SUNY Buffalo.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, my God, more snow than I knew ever existed on the earth.  It snowed in October and it didn't let up until April.  That lasted about two years.  Only reason I was there so long is that Buffalo was also on the border of Canada, and it was a wonderful center of jazz.  And, so, I would run up to Montreal [Canada] with my roommates.  And, we would hang out in the clubs listening to, you know, early Hugh Masekela, and the Mangione Brothers [Mangione Brothers Sextet], and anybody literally who was passing through on their way up to Toronto [Canada].  And, so, it was just a great little hot spot for, you know, music and culture, because it reminded me of when I was growing up in Queens [New York] with all the musicians that were, you know, just in there, you know, they were at their peak at that point in history.
Speaker 1: Did the little tourist things, little museums, did they have a lot of, kind of a turn of the century created museums around Niagara Falls--?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Artifacts that probably needed to be protected, but they're just laying out and--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: You can see them.
Speaker 2: Buffalo, Buffalo is one of those cities that sort of got lost, forgotten, and it had--it was wonderful place to discover stuff, to find stuff.  They had beautiful museums, the universities were great.  But, the university--I was one of the only black students at the time.  And, they were very awkward as it was at that time with having me there.  And, when I wanted to switch my major from home economics to art, they wouldn't let me do it.
Speaker 1: So, you had to maj- what made you decided to major in home economics?
Speaker 2: Because at that particular time, my parents [Evelyne Maxwell King and Oliver King, Sr.] and my family and my guidance counselor were trying to tell me that I needed to have a job that I could really do something.  So, home economics was big at that time.  I could cook.  I could sew.  I could do all of that stuff so I figured I could parlay it into a real job until I got into it.  And, I said, "Oh, my God, this is second to being a housewife in a classroom and this is the antithesis of what you wanna do." And, even though we had to take art courses as part of the curriculum and I did extremely well, and knew that's where I wanted to go, the home economics department at that time was dying department and they didn't wanna let any of the students move to other majors.  Because their numbers would diminish and they couldn't sustain that department.  So, I decided, you know, I'm tired of the snow.  I woke up one day and it was yet another blizzard and I looked out of my room and I was on the second floor.  And, the snow drift went from the, from the sidewalk to my windowsill.  Which meant that everybody in the first floor was in a blackout.  I tried to go across the street to get some food from the dining hall.  We couldn't get across the street because there was a whiteout.  And, the boys dorm next door had to form a human chain to come over to our dorm, the girls dorm, where they formed another human chain so that we can get over to the dining hall.  That's when I said, "I had enough with every kind of whiteness you could possibly imagine.  When I survive this semester, I am out of here.  I'm gone."
Story_ID: 430076
Speaker 1: And I went back to New York [New York].  I lived at home, and I went to The New School [The New School for Social Research; The New School, New York, New York] at night.  And, I worked for the General Electric company [GE] in Grand Central Station [Grand Central Terminal, New York, New York] in their small housewares service station, repairing people's typewriters and electric blankets and electric toothbrushes.  And, I did that for two years until I had enough with Corporate America.  I said, "That's the end of that."
Speaker 2: So, hanging out with your father [Oliver King, Sr.] prepared you to repair items, or how did--?
Speaker 1: Well, I was, I was at the front desk.  So, I wore the little uniform, the little blue--
Speaker 2: Smock, or--?
Speaker 1: But, yeah, and I, and I was able to determine if in fact the appliance needed repair and it was because of working with him.  And, how it could be repaired or how help people repair.  But, the best part of that job was that I dealt with a lot of physically challenged people.  And, at that time, General Electric was developing their electric toothbrush.  And, there was a lot of people who came up with cerebral palsy and other kind of neurological disorders and they were having problems with the first wave of toothbrushes that came out.  And, so, what I would do is, is I would help them or try to understand how the product was working or not working or if there was a flaw in the product.  And, invariably what I would do with all them, I would just give them new products.  I just gave away lots of GE stuff and, as I knew I was leaving.  But, what I used to love really is when the rich folks came from Upstate New York passing through, and they would drop off their toasters to be repaired.  And, they were so nasty and so smug to me, like you know, "Here girl, just put this in and get it fixed," you know, and then I would, I would give them their claim ticket.  When they would come to pick up their toasters, and we had policy with General Electric, well this is a New York City [New York, New York] statute that if in fact product, any appliance came in for repair that it had to not be infested.  And, it was not uncommon for people to have, you know, vermin and other kind of bugs and stuff.  So, what would happen is, is that, and the shop was located right on site.  And, the repairmen, we had about four of them, would open it up and if they saw any evidence they would take the appliance, they put it in a bag, and they put a little label on it that said, "Infested."  So, I would love it when I would find some of my most nasty customers coming back demanding their stuff and I'd go to the shelf with their claim ticket and I would see this little infested sign.  And, I would go back to counter, I'd be very discrete and I would say, "Excuse me sir, we can't fix it."  They said, "Why?"  And said, "But, we have an issue here."  And, I'd be trying to show them the label and they wouldn't wanna read the label, they would be so focused on attacking me.  And, I'd say, "Why don't you just read the label and read the slip?"  And, they say, "No, what is it?"  And, I'd said, "It's infested."  And, then they would be such, "Infested?"  And said, "Yes, you know like (gesture)."  (Laughter) And they would walk out the shop.  Oh, they would be so furious.  So, I would then take it and we had a big shoot, you know, then I'd just dump it down the shoot.  That would be my joy for the day or the week. I'd say, "Gotcha," (laughter).  I say, "You're the one with the bugs in the toaster, (laughter)."  So, but, after two years I was tired of that too.  I said, "No."  I went to the manager and I said, "You know what, I'm done with his job."  And, he says, "What do you mean, done?"  I said, "I'm giving you my notice."  I said, "I'm leaving in two weeks."  He says, "You can't leave."  He said, "This is the best job."  But, because of course, I was colored and I--this job I had gone through a search company, Richard Clarke [Richard Clarke Associates], who was an employment agency, African American, new.  And, this was very big for General Electric to have an African American, you know, working in this position.  But, I said, "You know what, my heart is not in Corporate America."  I can't keep dealing with, you know, infested toasters and burnt out electric blankets.  I said, "There's something else, for me."  He said, "Well, what are you gonna do?"  I said, "I don't know, but I'm going to find something."  He said, "Well, I'll keep the job open for thirty days."  I said, "Don't bother.  I will not be back."  And, I walked out the door.
Story_ID: 430077
Speaker 1: Of course, that freaked my mother [Evelyne Maxwell King] out.  Just the idea that I left a good paying job [with General Electric].  And, she said, "What are you going to do?"  And, I said, "I don't know."  She said, "What do you wanna do?"  I said, "All I know is, is can I find something to do in art or working with community programs, or working with a church after school program or something."  Anyway, she had a friend who worked in Bedford-Stuyvesant [Brooklyn, New York] for one of the end the poverty agencies, Title IV programs.  And, they were just starting up a program.  I quit in the spring.  And, they were starting up a program that summer where they were going to have activities and workshops and programs for the community in Bedford-Stuyvesant.  Which is like one of the largest African American communities in the country.  And, so, she told him that, "My daughter needs a job."  So, I went to Brooklyn [New York] and he interviewed me and he said, "I have a job for you."  And, I said, "Okay."  And, he says, "It's teaching art."  Oh, I was ecstatic.  I said, "When do I start?"  And, told me, he said, "Only there's one thing."  I said, "What?"  He says, "You don't have a classroom."  I said, "What do you mean, I don't have a classroom?"  He says, "Well, the plan of this project is to give you a truck and every day you will go to two different public park locations or street corners in Bedford-Stuyvesant.  And, you will work with a group of high school students to encourage members in the community to come work on these easels and do these drawings or paintings."  Well, you could've hit me over the head, I was devastated.  I burst into tears.  And, then I grabbed myself together and I went, "Okay.  I'm gonna do it."  'Cause I said to myself, "You said you wanted to teach art.  Now, you had this vision of being in this classroom with all these supplies and everything.  But, you know you're gonna be in a community where there are people who, under other circumstances, would never have had the opportunity to do this.  So, you're gonna do this."  And, that's what I did for the next two, three months.
Story_ID: 430078
Speaker 1: And while I was doing that, this young woman came around and asked me, how many high school students were working with me as my assistants.  And, I told her I had an assignment of about ten or twelve high school students.  And, she said, "Well," she said, "I have these scholarship opportunities for college."  And, I said, "You know," I said, "I hate to say this but some of them are junior delinquents already.  I imagine by the time college starts for them, they will not--they'll either be in jail or dead."  And, that the one or two who might have the potential are juniors, no they're soph- they're freshman, and jun- and sophomores and I don't know that this program is going to last that long."  Well, the young woman was so frustrated.  And, she looked at me and she said, "Have you finished college?"  And, I went, "No. I left college, and I've been taking courses at night."  She said, "Give me your name and address."  I give it to her and I never thought anything about it.  At the end of the summer, the job was over and I was sitting at the kitchen table with my mother [Evelyne Maxwell King].  And, she's looking at me like, "And, so now, what are you going to do?  'Cause you know you're not going to sit home."  And, I went, "I don't really have an idea of what I'm going to do."  So, while I was sitting there talking to her, I hadn't gone through my mail for the past two weeks.  And, I started to open the mail, and opened this letter and I read it, and I couldn't believe my eyes.  And, I gave the letter to my mother, and I said, in the middle of her chastising me, I said, "Shh, shh, shh, read this letter, read this letter.  Tell me, tell me if I'm reading this right."  My mother takes the letter, she reads it.  She doesn't say a word to me.  She puts the letter down on the table.  She goes into the living room and she gets her pocketbook.  When she comes back and she takes out a twenty dollar bill.  She says, "You will go take a bath, a shower, get dressed, put on some decent clothes, take this twenty dollars, call a cab and get over to the school now."  In the letter was a full scholarship, plus stipend, enrollment was the day, that day.  I got on the phone, I called the woman.  The woman on the other end started screaming at me, "Where are you?   We've been trying to find you.  You have not responded."  And, I said, "Madam, my mother has just given me money for cab, I will be there within an hour."  And, I went to Queens College [Queens, New York] and I went up to the registration desk and I said to the counselor, I said, "What can I major in?"  She said, "We don't care what you major in just make sure you're fully enrolled for a full complement of courses."  And, I walked right over to the art department and signed up for every art course I could take.  And, that's how it began.
Speaker 2: Now, what year is this?
Speaker 1: That was 1967.
Story_ID: 430079
Speaker 1: So, that's--this is a dream come true.
Speaker 2: This was like, this was kismet, fate.  This was like, you know, if you have a passion and you believe in the passion and you don't let go of the passion, something is going to realize itself.  And, this was my moment.  And, I came home and I told my mother [Evelyne Maxwell King], "Thank you for the money to go to take the cab."  I said, "I am finally majoring full-time in art."  She didn't even ask me what I was gonna do with it.  All she knew is, I had a full scholarship with a stipend, you understand.  And, I did not have to place any burdens on the family in terms of them supporting me other than house money.  I already had a secondary business.  I had a clothes design business which I made money on the side, making clothes for people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you were using your skills as a seamstress (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was using, I was using my skills as a seamstress to support myself.  Before that I was a, and I would babysit in between that for different families.  But, basically, I was supporting myself as a seamstress.
Speaker 1: So, you actually designed the clothes too?
Speaker 2: Oh, I had to, because I started to make clothes for performers; Ysaye Barnwell [Ysaye M. Barnwell] who's now performing with Sweet Honey in the Rock, was one of my first clients.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Lew Alcindor who lived around the corner from me was another one of my clients.  And, I--that was, that was the period where he became Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Now, that's a big job (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: He's 7'2" and--
Speaker 2: He was 7'2" and walked into a club, and he was best buddies with my, my brother [Oliver King, Jr.] and my cousins.  'Cause they were, they all played ball in high school.  And, I walked into a nightclub one night and he walked in, in one of the worst dashikis I had ever seen in my life.  And, I said to him, I said, "Where did you get that dashiki from?"  And, he said, "Somebody made it for him."  This was first year he was at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California].  And, he says, "And, they charged me a lot of money."  And, I said, "Those are awful.  Those are awful."  I said, and I told him who I was and so he knew my brother and cousins and I said, "Why don't you bring them around to me later on in the week and I will tailor them for you."  And, he said, "Okay."  And, he brought them and he said, "How much do I owe you?"  And, I said, "I'm not charging you anything."  I said, "You're already a public figure."  And, I said, "And, you can't afford to look less than excellent in the public eye."  And, so, we all became friends after that, and his family was from Trinidad.  And, so, when he went to Trinidad on one of the trips to see his family, he brought me back a set of bangles to say thank you.  And, he went on back to UCLA.  But, you know, I would, I would make clothes for children who had different kinds of physical disabilities.  Like I had one child who had a displaced shoulder that was higher than the other, you know.  Or, some women who were morbid obesity or, I, it didn't matter.  I liked the challenge.  I like the challenge of making them look beautiful 'cause I felt everybody has the right to look beautiful.  And, I love sewing.  Some women would go overseas and travel and buy fabric and come back and want dresses.  And, so, all the skills that my [maternal] grandmother [Ottalie Adalese Maxwell] had mastered are some of the skills that I used to make the garments.
Story_ID: 430080
Speaker 1: You mentioned the dashiki on Lew Alcindor [Kareem Abdul-Jabbar].  Now, this was the time of the explosion of culture and that people call the Black Arts Movement.  What, how, I mean, just, you said, you were involved in civil rights (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: Before as well?
Speaker 2: Right.  Well, during that period, yes.  I, we, I had my dress business on the side.  And, Ysaye Barnwell [Ysaye M. Barnwell] was a folk singer at the time, and she would sing in the coffee houses in Greenwich Village [New York, New York].  And, so, she needed costumes and dresses that were, you know, unusual and ethically orientated.  And, so, I would design garments for her out of the African fabrics that were being, then imported into New York [New York].  And, at the same time, we would be picketing the White Castle three blocks from our house.  Or, Woolworth [F.W. Woolworth Company], or we would be marching with CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] or SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] or any kind of egregious issue that was occurring at the time.  And, of course, this was all so very scary to my mother [Evelyne Maxwell King].  But, my father [Oliver King, Sr.] was secretly like enjoying it because that was the Garveyite in us coming out, you understand.  So, I was doing all of these things simultaneously.  I was very much involved in the time--
Story_ID: 430081
Speaker 1: Then when the war came up, the Vietnam War, I was an ardent anti-war protester on campus.  And, my--even though my brother [Oliver King, Jr.] went to Vietnam and was a Vietnam survivor--and we, we had pretty intense discussions about the war.  But, I didn't, I didn't believe in war.  I didn't believe in guns.  I still don't.  And, so I was adamantly opposed (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Did--was he philosophically committed to the war?
Speaker 1: No.  It's, you know, he got drafted.  He got drafted.  You know, he was in that flow, in that loop at the time.  He was not, you know, an ardent gung-ho war hero.  But, he was a boy and he liked guns, okay.  And, see that, that's the edgy thing about war and politics, you understand.  They sort of play the gender issues, the kind of testosterone, the love, you know, somewhere between the gun and the penis, you know, there are these kind of issues that that kind of blur.  And, so, young men who want to feel empowered, you understand, are reluctant participants in this.  I'm sure in reflection, my brother has enough issues as a result of the Vietnam War with post-traumatic stress disorders to having--become part of anger management groups that the entire family is very happy.  Because the war did not do kind things to him, or any of the other gentlemen, young gentlemen who went.  I lost several cousins.  I lost lots of friends.  I saw my brother completely compromised, you understand, by this war.  So, it's hard when it's your family and it's somebody you grew up with.  And, you see what these kind of like, human atrocities can do in the name of justice, freedom, and democracy.  But, yet still these young men are coming home and they're still compromised because they're black.  Or, they're from the ghetto, as, as was the terms at the time, and they're dangerous, and they're angry and they're violent.  So, the, the mixed signals and mixed attitudes at the time were very traumatic for everyone.  My mother [Evelyne Maxwell King] lost her hair just worrying about her only son being in Vietnam.  My father [Oliver King, Sr.] was trying to be protective of the family but at the same time, he's building warships, you know.  It was very, very tense, very difficult times for families and individuals to reconcile their roles, you know.  World War I [WWI], was World War I, and World War II [WWII] was one thing, and the Korean War was another.  But, Vietnam was a war, the first war we (air quotes) lost.
Story_ID: 430082
Speaker 1: In the midst of this, now, there were, there were people from--who had volunteered with SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] in the South,  who were returning to major U.S. cities, especially in New York [New York].  I know a lot of people were coming back to New York from Mississippi.  People like Muhammad Ahmad [Maxwell Curtis Stanford, Jr.], (unclear) and others were involved in RAM [Revolutionary Action Movement] and other move--did, did you meet (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I went to the March on Washington.
Speaker 1: Did--okay.
Speaker 2: I was, I was there; scared to death, me and my little cousin.  She slept on my lap all the way there and we went on a yellow school bus, all right.  We were terrified.
Speaker 1: Did you go with specific group?  Was it CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] or a group or (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, we went with a, we went with a church sponsored group.
Speaker 1: Church, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And, we, we were for the longest what appeared to be the longest time, the only, we didn't see any other buses on the road but ourselves.  And, we were just, you know, because we had been watching the news.  We saw the, you know the, the Greyhound buses being torched.  But, I was determined to go.  And, my mother [Evelyne Maxwell King] was terrified to let me go.  But, by that time my mother had already sort of realized that there wasn't too much that she could stop me from doing because I was very adamant and passionate about these things.  And I got on the bus and with my little cousin and Renee Demonte [ph.], and we went down to the march.  And, as we were getting closer to Washington [D.C.], we might have been like an hour and a half outside of Washington, all of a sudden on the road, we started to see other buses.  And, one of the buses was a bus for motor coach charted--charter and there were, they were all white on the bus.  And, so, we didn't know what to make of it.  And, so, as our buses sort of lined up on the road as we were going down some of the older white people on the bus began to wave at us, and we waved back.  And, then we knew we were all going to the same place.  And, when we got there, we got there in just enough time to hear King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] say, "I really thought you weren't gonna make it.  I was waiting (laughter)," okay.  And, and, that was, that was a hell of a moment for us, okay.  That was, that was, that was a great, that was a, that was a great thing that we could've done at that point in history, you know.  To be part of that era, you know, but it just continued.  I never stopped being involved because when I stopped (air quotes) marching and picketing, my mouth, I would be in situations whether I was in the workplace or I was in school and I was constantly speaking out.  I was constantly asking the questions, why?  How is it?  Why not?  Do you understand; how does this happen?  I was always, uncomfortable with the status quo which was clearly to the disadvantage of the larger populace; everyone.  Because I always saw it as the oppressor is as challenged and compromised as those people they are oppressing.  The horror goes both ways.  And, so, how is it that, that we continue to participate and allow these conditions to exist, so.  My whole life has been, you know, I've been like a warrior.  Just fighting.  Just fighting.  Just not satisfied knowing that we as human beings--we can do better.  And, I'm no goody two-shoes, you know.  I'm no, Rebecca [Rebecca Rowena Randall] of Sunnybrook Farm.  I'm just human.  I'm just trying to work with my own issues, my own challenges, you understand.
Story_ID: 430083
Speaker 1: I saw a picture of the Black Student Union.  It was 1969 or so, I guess.
Speaker 2: Sixty-nine [1969], '70 [1970], 1970.  Say, 1970 that's--
Speaker 1: It was at Queens College [Queens, New York] and it's a nice group of people there.  And, they have like huge afros.  Everybody's a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, that's Johns Hopkins [Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland].  That's when I was at Johns Hopkins.
Speaker 1: That's Johns Hopkins.  Okay, that's a little different then.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  When I went--yeah, but, that group was a combination of all of the undergraduate black students, and all the graduate black students who had just been admitted into Hopkins in the two year period between 1979 to 1971.  And, this was part of--
Speaker 1: Sixty-nine [1969] to '71 [1971], you mean.
Speaker 2: Sixty-nine [1969] to '71 [1971].  This was part of their first affirmative action initiative to integrate the campus and address the conditions of African Americans having opportunity for education at that august university.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well let's get you there.  At Queens College in the art department, I mean, did you, I mean, what was, did you learn a lot there?  Did you--?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was in love.  I was in love at Queens College in the art department.  I had one of the most awesome experiences.  Which is in such opposition to all of my other educational experience.  Because in that particular environment, I had complete and total support from my being there, my intelligence, and every professor I had wer- and I had nothing but white professors, worked without questions to help me realize everything I wanted, and pushed me to the level where I was so confident.  I was so over confident.  I had the temerity to believe that when I got this scholarship to go to Johns Hopkins to do a doctorate, I could do it.  Because they had imbued that much confidence in me, combined with my own, that I could see a vision for myself.  And, they had no trepidations about wanting me to be the best that I could be.  They did have problems however, my head of the department, Louis Finkelstein, when I was applying, they called him to ask him, could I handle a doctoral program.  And, he, coming from a Jewish background and understanding all of the issues of the Holocaust and oppression, he was livid.  And, told them in rather profound language that I could do whatever the F I wanted to do, if I decide to.
Story_ID: 434970
Speaker 1: Now what did you specialize in at Queens College [Queens, New York] in terms of art?  Did you specialize in something specific (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  Painting and ceramic sculpture.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Those were my two major area of interest (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You do oil painting primarily or?
Speaker 2: Acrylic.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Acrylic.  Acrylic on canvas.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, I was asking you about the atmosphere of New York [New York] in those days with all the Black Arts Movement starting.  Now, you--
Speaker 2: It was intense because that was the year, 1969 that the Studio Museum in Harlem [New York, New York] was established.  And, there was a lot of discussion about what a museum focused or dedicated to the African American aesthetic experience would be like.  In--as I was in school at that time, I remember that my professors were very insistent about going into the city to look at the shows at the museums, all the museums, including the Studio Museum.  Go to the galleries, don't be so smug and self-centered they would think, say, to think that you're the only one who has invented a new aesthetic approach.  You should be aware of what's going on around you.  So, as I was doing this, I was also by myself because I'm the only black student in my class.  I'm certainly the only black student, you know, in my group, who has any desire or passion to move through New York in the art world.  And, so, basically I was a loner.  I was a loner.  Even thought there was one other young woman, Lowery Sims [Lowery Stokes Sims], who, she and I ended up becoming best friends, life friends.  She was the only major in art history and I was the only major in the studio department at Queens College.  And, she and I were Girl Scouts.  We were in the Girl Scout troop [Girls Scouts of the United States of America] together.
Speaker 1: So, your mother [Evelyne Maxwell King] had it right when she put in that Girl Scout troop?
Speaker 2: She was absolutely right.  She was, she nailed it.  I mean, she figured out, you have somehow or rather you need to be in a community of like-minded, equally gifted young women, all right.  Because you need to figure out who you're going to be.  And, that group was, that was a revelatory group, a growing up group.  Young women in that group who ultimately evolved, because we were all in the throes of our sexual identity.  But, here we were with young women who actually became lesbians.  And, we were in that discussion with them.  We were in the middle of the metamorphosis with them.  As we were also morphing into our own identities.  So, it was a real awakening for us as young women asserting our, a sense of self and agency and at the same time, asserting ourselves politically and ethnically.  And, the world was hot bed at that time.  New York was a firecracker of, of, of kind of like culture explosions and collisions and just calamities.  And, and that's because it was just New York.  But, then compounded with all of the national politics that were going on and the fact that Africa was increasingly becoming decolonized.  And, the doors were opening.  People were going to Africa for the first time instead of wondering what Africa was about, they were actually going to Africa and coming back.  And, Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture], do you understand, was going back, soon to become part of that landscape.  And, so, you know, and that's the throes of the era when, you know, Malcolm X is assassinated, and Martin Luther King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] assassinated.
Story_ID: 434971
Speaker 1: Now were you, you fairly conscious of what was going on when Malcolm X was assassinated?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was very aware of Malcolm X, because Malcolm X used to speak up in Harlem [New York, New York] all the time.  And, I used to have a little part-time job that I worked up in Harlem.  So, the irony is, is that in the North, especially those of us who grew up in New York [New York], Malcolm was our hero.  In the South, Martin [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was the hero for the South.  But, we in the North were very aware of Malcolm and Malcolm's teachings, and Malcolm's speeches.  And, it was not uncommon for us to be some place and have Malcolm appear to speak in the group.  So, you know, and it's New York.  You've got celebrities all over and sort of celebrities sort of become regulars because that's the nature of living in New York.  You, you get to be in the company of these people.
Speaker 1: Now, Malcolm lived in Queens [New York]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  He lived down in Queens, absolutely.  So, you know, he was a neighbor.  You know, we knew Malcolm as a, a neighbor.  But, we also knew him, that he was a Muslim, that he was a Black Muslim.  That he was outspoken.  But, even at that time, we knew that his relationships with the Honorable Elijah Muhammad were becoming rocky.  And, we also, those of us, because you know, I'm a young college student, you know, budding intellectual, budding geekoid--geekazoid, all right.  And, I'm, I'm recognizing that Malcolm's tenure is changing.  Malcolm and Martin, you understand, are coming too close, you understand, in the ideologies.  And, I'm already damaged from that moment in history because I've already been through the assassinations of Kennedys [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy] both of them.  I've already witness with assassination of Medgar Evers.  So, I know that there is a potential for more of this kind of violence to occur.  But, I'm, I'm fascinated with the fact that I am living in, and I knew that I was living as a, a young adult, in a time of great emotional and historical intensity.  I knew that.  I mean, the Freedom Rides, the anti-war protest.  Everything was happening.  It was, it was exciting, and it was scary.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was exciting, and it was terribly scary.
Story_ID: 434972
Speaker 1: Would you say that the assassination of Malcolm X kind of shook up the New York [New York] community more than the assassination of Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think they, they were equal in different ways.  Malcolm was, was our own neighbor.  He was, you know, he was a man that many New Yorkers had a relationship with.  While, Martin's persona had grown larger.  He had grown across state lines and boundaries because he began to embrace larger projects even though they were for a common cause and a common good.  Malcolm because he was still so localized and focused as a (air quotes) Muslim, do you understand.  Unless you were part of that community and culture, he did not, at that time, have the same kind of largesse of presence as Malcolm--as King.  But, by the same token no one, no one dismissed, as I was growing up in New York, the importance of Malcolm's role in the movement, okay.  He was our icon, he was our god, all right.  And, when he was killed in that ballroom [Audubon Ballroom; Malcolm X and Dr. Betty Shabazz Memorial and Educational Center, New York, New York], it was devastating.  It was as devastating as when King got shot on that balcony.
Speaker 1: Now, were you in Buffalo [New York], when he was killed (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, I was in New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was back in New York, all right.  So, the same thing with King.  When King got killed, it was the eeriest experience I ever had at, at Queens College [Queens, New York] because I was at home at the time he was assassinated.  And, I decided I--and I was taking afternoon and evening classes and I decided to go up to campus to get some books and some of my sculptures, smaller sculptures so that I could work on them at home.  Because I figured things were gonna be rocky for the next few days.  And, I knew, I didn't know if there were gonna be riots, so I was trying to prepare myself.  So, I went up to campus that day, the day that he was assassinated.  And, I walked into the buildings, and all the lights were on, and all the doors were open.  And, there was no one at the desk.  It was like a ghost town.  It was the eeriest thing I had ever seen in my life.  So, I went, got my materials and came home.  And, I told my mother [Evelyne Maxwell King], I said, "Mom," I said, "I went up to school," and I said, "It was so strange."  I said, "All the doors were opened.  There were no security officers or anything."  Well, Queens College is basically, it's a huge campus.  So, it was like forty thousand students at the time.  And, it's basically a Jewish campus, it's a Jewish culture.  And, my mother explained to me that in Jewish traditions when someone passes, and someone passes of that prominence, people just get up and they leave as part of the grieving.  They just vacate that space to go someplace, usually home or to synagogue or whatever.  But, that the normal routines just stop.  And, that's what it was, it just stopped.  So, it was, it was, it was a catharsis which catapulted the state and the city and the country into a spiral.  And, Malcolm's assassination did so similarly on a more intimate level geographically within the New York area with, you know, overriding impact and ripple effects.  But, no, they both for me were equally as--
Story_ID: 434973
Speaker 1: How did the Civil Rights Movement and the Black Arts Movement as it was kind of burgeoning at the time, how did those movements and your, and all the cultural, I guess, different thoughts and ideas, you said that people's sexuality were being discussed for the first time.  People coming (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, absolutely, yes.
Speaker 1: Back from Africa for the first time--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: And discuss it.  How did all that affect your artwork?
Speaker 2: Well, it affected my artwork in that I, I increasingly, well, I started off in a very kind of formalist position because I was doing very large color field paintings.  And, because I was fascinated about color and the conversations that I had had with my professor, Herbert Aach, who is a German painter who was also doing a lot of experimentations with new pigments and fluorescent colors.  And, he was a wonderful friend and mentor throughout my three years of studying with him.  And, he always insisted and wanted me to continue with my art.  He was adamant about that.  So, that when I went to graduate school [Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland], he was not entirely enamored with that decision.  Because he thought that I would fall into the track of becoming an administrator or an art historian, which would take me away from the creative work that he felt I needed to do.  But, what I did was is I continued to work on the side.  Because I quickly realized that there were so few people in the field of art history, in the area of curatorial studies who were addressing our concerns, either as African Americans, or women, or disenfranchised populations, or under represented populations, that I began to see huge gaps that needed to be addressed.  And, so, as I was teaching and becoming a dean of a graduate school [Maryland Institute College of Art, Baltimore, Maryland], trying to figure out what that was, I was constantly on the side curating small shows, and museum shows.  And, every time I would do a show, I would say to the institution, "Do you have money to create a publication?  Because, if you're going to do this exhibition and you don't have a publication where we can record the history, analyze the legacy, or critique the viability of this work, it means that this exhibition never happened."  And, we don't have a track record of where we have come from as a creative people within this period of time in history.  And, so, this is how the Black Arts Movement began to affect me because I began to observe how black artists, certain in the New York [New York] area which was a tinder box of creativity, we're responding to the Civil Rights Movement.  So, I began to notice that many of the images that were being created were images that talked to the people, talked to the community.  Oftentimes, they were more figurative in orientation because abstraction is a far more difficult forum for a popular cultures or mainstream cultures to embrace.  And, so, topically and thematically and in terms of content, I would see artists taking on the (air quotes) themes of a, of a Civil Rights Movement, of freedom of liberation of resistance, all right, you will find all these topics.
Story_ID: 434974
Speaker 1: Now, on the other side of that, feminism, feminism, gay liberation, all right, black identity politics are begin to loom large and they're all converging, all right.  Now, the feminist come a little behind, on the tails of the Black Arts Movement, using a lot of the strategy sometimes of that movement.  But, basically, all of these groups are converging and morphing at the same point in time in history.  And, they were all asking questions that basically say, "What happened to me?  Where am I in the stream of the American consciousness?"  Or, "Where do I fit into the legacies of American character, identity, and heritage?"  And, so, each of these groups are finding and practicing, "What does my voice sound like when it's heard when it's not a dominant white male?" all right.  What does that look like for artist, for us, you understand, that would be the question.  We are about seeing.  We are about visualizing and actualizing the business of how does it take form, all right.  What materials are we going to use?  Because, historically, African American artist in this country did not really start to go to (air quotes) art schools or universities until really the '60s [1960s].  Because most of these institutions, unless it was a HBCU, historically black college and university, were closed to these individuals.  And, so, it was left to the HBCUs to do the culture edification and enlightenment that was necessary for a people to take authority over who images us.  And, this is in the face of the continuous traditions, or legacies of the minstrel performers, as well as the media who are using the old black samples, and the Aunt Jemimas, and the, and the Uncle Bens, you understand, and the Gold Dust Twins, and the Sambos with big lips, and just black people with tails and bug eyes, and sharp teeth.  The media's relentless need to demonize us.  So, here are the visual artist looking at all of this contemporary mainstream imagery that is used to suppress and diminish African Americans, and so, they begin to ask questions about, "How is it that our art, individually and collectively, can make a difference about how our community see themselves?  And, what are the stories that we're going to tell?  How are we gonna empower ourselves?"
Story_ID: 434975
Speaker 1: So you have groups like Spiral which was founded in part by Romare Bearden coming out of New York [New York].  You have AfriCOBRA, which is a Chicago [Illinois] movement here, African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists.  And, then you have in New York, Weusi Nyumba Ya Sanaa, which was a group which had an African centered base that started out of Harlem [New York, New York] and had parallel kind of concerns to the AfriCOBRA movement.  And, these artist began to band in collectives.  And, what they do is, is in many instances unlike Spiral, because that was an earlier group that started in the early '60s [1960s] at the front of the Civil Rights Movement.  By the time we get to AfriCOBRA which is more like 1967, '68 [1968], '69 [1969] with [HistoryMaker] Jeff Donaldson being one of the lead architects of that movement, you get these artists moving out and annexing or seizing neighborhoods, blighted neighborhoods, and saying to the municipalities involved, "This area has been so decimated for so long.  And, you have said that you were going to do something or you haven't even acknowledged that this is a sight of visual oppression for this community.  We artist are gonna go in and take it over."  So, there you begin to see the beginnings of the wall mural movement, okay.  Chicago has one of the finest traditions, Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], New York, Baltimore [Maryland], and this was, this became a mechanism out of the Black Arts Movement to assert an authority and an integrity within a community to say to the community, "We value you.  We value ourselves."  Because the images that we're painting on the wall were the heroes.  They were the history makers.  They were the icons.  They were athletes, the stars, the warriors, the soldiers, the survivors.  And, so, these stories began to be told on the walls of the city, out in the open.  Not in an art gallery.  Because when it came to art galleries, when it came to the museums, we were not there.  We were not invited.  We were not encouraged.  We were not even collected.  On the feminist side, there was a group called the Guerrilla Girls who would dress up in gorilla costumes.  And, one of their primary initiatives was to critique and challenge culture institutions, museums and galleries primarily, about who they represented.  So, the Guerrilla Girls would stand outside of your gallery or your museum dressed in gorilla costumes.  And, they would have posters and sign, which gave the statistics of what you're institution does and most likely does not do to support these groups which your institution had disenfranchised or eradicated from being collectable or viable or part of the American dream.  So, all of these things are going on and they're all bouncing back and forth against each other (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now--
Story_ID: 434976
Speaker 1: I know there's a predecessor on some level to AfriCOBRA [African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists] and the Black Arts Movement being a National Conference of Artists.  But, can you--
Speaker 2: It's even a greater precedence for that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  The National Conference of Artists came about in the 1950s.  And, that was a coalition of schools teachers, art teachers, all right.  Basically, from schools in southern regions or in predominately black urban regions.  It--this really goes back to its kind of, I would say, phase of, of, of earliest development during the WPA [Works Progress Administration; Work Projects Administration].  And, this was, this was an inadvertent phenomenon, okay.  I wasn't even born, you know, at the time that the WPA came into being during the, you know, Great Depression of 1929.  But, the government, you know, just, almost in a kind of serendipitous act, created this system.  FDR [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] created this system, you know, Franklin Delano Roosevelt believed that all Americans needed a job to support themselves, to preserve their dignity, and to support their country.  And, when he went to create the system of the Works Project Administration, he went to the census records to identify all of the jobs which are acknowledged by the federal government to which people subscribed themselves for employment.  And, according to these job categories, he create divisions, units, and projects where people could go sign up and be paid.  One of the greatest anomalies was that he created a whole series of projects for artists.  Meaning, artists could go sign up and you could be an easel artist.  Who would imagine during this (unclear) in the '30s [1930s], okay.  That a black man, black woman could get paid every week to paint pictures, to make prints, to run a community art center, all right.
Speaker 1: So, this is, the irony of this is that I guess, some of the white artists were doing that, and now couldn't find the works of the government to providing it; but, the black artist never had that.
Speaker 2: Never had that.  Never had that opportunity.  So, here's the even great profound irony, the WPA is created and lo and behold, artists white and black are starting to communicate and talk.  Because, you know, when you get paid, you both have to stand on the same line, all right.  And, you're finding a common ground because all artist are basically working class poor people, okay.  And, when you look at the nomenclature of how people are divided within stratas of hierarchy, the artist in the United States are somewhere below the blue collar status, all right.  So, here you have these artists beginning to talk around the same kind of issues.  As well as talking about, how do I visualize these, you understand.  How do I talk about rural white poor America, okay.  In comparison to rural black poor America, or urban America, or at that point in time, growing, burgeoning suburbia.  Who knew what that was?  But, it was a thing that became, became part of the modernist epoch.  It became part of the questions of, how do we become modern people?  What, what is that makes up modern?  And, all of these artists, this huge mix, were part of that question.  They were part of that experience.  And, so, it is not hard to understand in the aftermath of the two world wars, and the Korean War, and then the Vietnam War, that people, they start to get smarter.  They start to understand the nature of politics.  They understand also the role that art can do to support the wellbeing and health of a community.  Now granted, the WPA was but a flash, (makes sound), with an entire ten year cycle from like, 1929 to about 1939, which was like the throes of it.  It was, (makes sound), gone.  But, in that period of time, we have never seen that kind of support from our government.  And, that was an absolutely florescent period which dovetailed with a period called the Harlem Renaissance.  Or, more appropriately known as the New Negro movement, where African American artist, writers, dancers, sculptors, painters, photographers, were assuming authority over imaging their sense of selves, their communities, their identities, and they were reclaiming or claiming an authority that they had never had before, 'cause they were never let in the doors.
Story_ID: 434977
Speaker 1: Here in Chicago [Illinois], the South Side Community Art Center--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Is a remnant of WPA [Works Progress Administration; Work Projects Administration]--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: And [HistoryMaker] Margaret Burroughs--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --is one of the founders, is also a founder of the National Conference of Artists, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Margaret Burroughs, Charles White [Charles Wilbert White], okay.  You can, you can (unclear), you can--I mean, you could go down, because these artists were moving and relocating.  The South Side Art Center was one of the Harlem Art Center [Harlem Community Art Center, New York, New York], all right.  In Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] they had a graphics workshop with Dox Thrash and Raymond Steth.  I mean, you know, down into Washington, D.C., you had James Wells [James Lesesne Wells], and James Porter [James A. Porter], and Lois Mailou Jones who, who, who wasn't as close but somewhat involved.  And, then go down to Atlanta [Georgia], and you have Hale Woodruff, you know, at the Atlanta Center [Atlanta University Center; Atlanta University Center Consortium, Atlanta, Georgia].  You have all of these spots.  And, in Cleveland [Ohio], you have the Karamu House, and Hughie Lee-Smith and Elmer Brown.  And, I mean, we have all of these pockets all the way out to San Francisco [California] where you have Sargent Johnson who is a sculptor.  And, he rose in the ranks to assume every position of authority in leadership that there was in the WPA.  This is a tremendous achievement in a very short space of time.  But, it was also a glimmer of what was possible.  So, that when the Black Arts Movement starts to flourish again in the '60s [1960s] and into the '70s [1970s], it is not uncommon for people to compare it to what happened during the WPA.  Because at that point in history, the National Endowment of the Arts [sic. National Endowment for the Arts] has reinstitute, has created grants to support artist, and communities, and museums to do these kinds of initiatives (background noise).
Story_ID: 434978
Speaker 1: You got a fellowship in '69 [1969].  Now this is, so this is like the NEA [National Endowment for the Arts], at that point, is only about three of four years old, I guess?
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But, my fellowship--
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Was not part of NEA.  My fellowship was part of initiative of the City University of New York [New York, New York] to bring--it was their affirmative action initiative, to bring students of African American, and at that time Puerto Rican, because that was the huge population that was coming in, back to school to get their degrees.
Speaker 1: So, this is the Horizon Fellowship?
Speaker 2: That's the Horizon Fellowship.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: No, no, that's not the Horizon.
Speaker 1: It's not.
Speaker 2: That was the Seek; SEEK fellowship.
Speaker 1: SEEK, okay.  How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: S-E-E-K.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Search for Education, Evaluation and Knowledge [sic. Search for Education, Elevation, and Knowledge].
Speaker 1: So, this is in '69 [1969]?
Speaker 2: Yep.  That was in '69 [sic. 1967] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: And, I think that lasted for maybe almost ten years, underwritten by the City University of New York.  And, basically was looked upon as part of that period of the open door policy.  Where anybody could sign up for college, you know, to get an education, until they either ran out of politics or the pedagogy did not support the politics.
Story_ID: 434979
Speaker 1: Walk us through what happened after you graduated.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, just as I was graduating from Queens College [Queens, New York], I had gotten a job in a Title IV program administered under the federal government for a project called Performing Arts Workshops.  In each borough in New York City [New York, New York] had a Performing Arts Workshop.  Which was basically an after school program located in a public school site where we would deal with math--with music, dance, art, and basically those were the three areas.  And, we would run a variety of courses.  Dance courses, instrumental courses teaching guitar or drumming, orchestra courses, and then I have variety of all kinds of art class, arts and craft and painting classes.  And, so, I did that until I graduated.  And, then I got the opportunity to go to Johns Hopkins University [Baltimore, Maryland] through another scholarship offer.
Speaker 1: So, this is still in '69 [1969], fall of '69 [1969]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, Johns Hopkins University.  Now, were you there to work on a master's degree?
Speaker 2: I was there to work on a Ph.D.
Speaker 1: Ph.D., okay.
Speaker 2: I got a master's in the process.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, basically I was admitted into the doctoral program.  And, that was the Horizon Fellowship.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 434980
Speaker 1: And I got that grant [Horizon Fellowship] ironically because the Ford Foundation [New York, New York] had been having a fellowship competition for fifty awards for African Americans to go on to work on their doctorate at the university of their choice.  You had to make your application to the university.  But, you made your application to them for the funding to support that education.  And, I applied for that funding scholarship.  And, but, had not applied to grad schools.  However, as I applied for this Ford Foundation fellowship, and again I'm sitting at my mother's [Evelyne Maxwell King] kitchen table and she's asking me, "Okay, so now what are you gonna do with your life?"  I had not applied to grad school because I had no money to pay for the applications.  But, I didn't have to courage to tell her that.  So, while I am applying for this fellowship for the Ford Foundation and she's well aware of that, and the application goes in.  All of a sudden, I started getting these packages in the mail.  And, in those days when they sent you a special delivery, they would actually deliver it at two, three, four, five o'clock in the morning.  So, the doorbell kept ringing for the next two or three weeks with these special delivery packages.  And, I had gotten about, at least twenty-five offers to go to school, to grad school.  Well, you know, I'm like, I am totally flabbergasted.  I don't know what to say.  My mother thinks I'm brilliant because I have applied to all of these places.  And, finally I had to tell her, "I didn't apply to any of 'em.  And, I don't know where these applications are coming from."  Until I got a letter from Johns Hopkins University [Baltimore, Maryland] who explained in their offer to me to apply to their school, that the Ford Foundation had made its awards of fifty candidates to receive their fellowships.  But, they had found out of the seven hundred plus applications another twenty-five or thirty people that they would have given money to had they had more dollars.  So, what they did was, is they put our names, including mine, on this list and sent it to all of the major universities in the United States.  And, said, "Look, if you have scholarship money, these are students of African American--," or black students, whatever the language was at the time, "who we would ardently support and we would consider it a great asset if you would encourage them to apply to your school."  And, so, I decided to apply to Hopkins for this reason.  Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] had already been assassinated and I began to see politically that universities were lining up behind this new affirmative action initiative.  But, I knew that it was a half-hearted attempt because they really didn't want us to get the degrees and assume the leadership positions.  Because I saw too many students get the degree, and get the award, and then after a year, they were gone.  They never completed the degrees.  So, I chose my school to attend according to the legal capacity to hold this school to this letter as a contract.  And, I applied to Hopkins and I got in.  And, after two years, they threw me out (laughter).
Story_ID: 434981
Speaker 1: I had been politically, extremely active on campus.  That's that picture that you see with the Black Student Union, all of us.  I had been recruiting students from various HBCU campuses [historically black colleges and universities].  I was very disturbed after my second year of graduate school and I, after my first year of graduate school, when I came back to campus and at least a half to three quarters of all of the students who were in the graduate programs were gone.  And, so, myself, and two other classmates, Michael Smith [ph.] and Joel Morris [ph.], formed ourselves as a committee of three and we visited every department on campus where missing graduate students had not returned.  And, we visited all the departments including the vice president at the time, Milton Eisenhower [Milton Stover Eisenhower], to ask him, "Why is it that so many students were brought in--?"  That was a big picture.  There were a lot of people in that picture.  "And, we return in the second year and two thirds of them are gone?"  Well, that didn't go very well with many people.  I was just, you know, too vocal.  I was very nice.  I was polite.  But, I just wouldn't shut-up.  And, so, the department negotiated me into a position where I had to take my doctoral exams prematurely, without more than two weeks' notice to prepare for the exams.  And, I knew, and this was in the spring semester, that if I didn't pass the exams, I would be terminated from the department and there would be no lead time to petition the department for a hearing.  So, my two best buddies in the department, Lowery Sims [Lowery Stokes Sims] and David Boxer, who had come from, was an undergrad at Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York] and went on to become the director of the National Gallery of Jamaica [Kingston, Jamaica], prepped me for the exam.  'Cause you must remember I was an artist.  I was not an art historian.  And, even though I had some of the finest training at Queens College [Queens, New York], my major was not art history.  My major was studio art.  But, with help of Lowery and David, they coached me through this two or three day process of exams.  And, as it turned out, I was the only one to pass; much to their chagrin.  And, they would not tell me I had passed.
Story_ID: 434982
Speaker 1: So I had to walk into the department chair's office and ask her point blank, "Why is it that I was not informed of my status when I was really moved into a position to take this exam without proper preparation?"  And, that I knew that in twenty-four hours, they knew who passed the exams.  And, she told me that, "Well, Leslie [HistoryMaker Leslie King-Hammond] the committee's decided that, yes, you passed," and she said under her breath, "You passed very well."  She wouldn't look me in the eyes.  She just said, "You passed very well."  And, I'm just sitting there looking at her, and I said, "And?"  She said, "But, it's the decision of the committee that you're extremely talented and you can do whatever you wanna do and you don't really need a doctorate to go any further."  And, I said, "Oh, really."  I said, "And, how did you come up with that?"  "Well, we really don't have any more money in your fellowship package and, you know, if you can come up with the money we might entertain you coming back in the fall."  I said, "Might entertain?"  I said, "I'm not making any sense of this at all."  She says, "Well, I'm just doing this, you know, as a maternal thing for your, for your own good."  So, that's when it just hit me and I just sort of went politely ballistic and I said, this is Dr. Phoebe Stanton [Phoebe Baroody Stanton], I said, "Dr. Stanton, please be advised that I have a very good black mother [Evelyne Maxwell King] in New York [New York], who really talks very much like you and wants me to leave here because this has not been a kind or friendly place to study.  However, I do believe that I had to sign a letter of contractual agreement and return it to your office, to this office at Johns Hopkins [Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland], indicating that I accept the terms of this fellowship.  So, as far as I'm concerned, it's on me whether and when I terminate this relationship." Well, she was absolutely undone.  She was livid.  And, I said, "I have no doubt that you will be hearing from me again.  Because I will be back in the fall.  And, I will seek to resolve this."  And, I walked up out of the office.  I walked straight across campus to the president's office, and I walked in and I said to his executive assistant, and he had just been hired.  This new African American administrator who was gonna oversee Hopkins Hospital [The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland] and Hopkins' Homewood Campus, I said, "My name is Leslie King.  I have just been thrown out of the art history department after passing my doctoral exams, with flying colors, and I am told that I am too talented and that I don't need this degree.  I wanna see the president now."
Story_ID: 434983
Speaker 1: Well, the administrative assistant looked at me and he said, "Look, I have just gotten into this job.  I haven't been here barely a month."  He said, "Could you just give me a chance to get myself together and we'll get this to--"  I said, "Fine."  And, I left my phone number.  I walked out the door.  I walked back to my apartment.  I picked up the phone, I called the professor at Morgan [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] and I said, "I don't like the politics here.  They've just thrown me out.  Give me the name of three lawyers," okay.  I got three lawyers names.  The first lawyer I called was [HistoryMaker] Robert Mack Bell, who is now one of the most distinguished judges in Baltimore, Maryland, sitting on the, one of the courts there.  And, I called him and I said, my name, the case and everything, and I said, "I don't have much money left in my, savings account for money, for my graduate research."  I said, "But, I have enough money to at least pay for a retainer."  And, he had listened to me, he asked a few questions and he said, "I cannot take any money from you."  And, I said, "Why?"  He said, "When I was student at Morgan, I was arrested while I was on a picket line.  And, the lawyer at the time who defended me, Juanita Jackson [Juanita Jackson Mitchell], said that as she got all of us out of jail," and there must have been, you know, ten or twelve of them, "that we could not pay her.  But, that our commitment was to have to help anybody who came along with a similar kind of case."  He said, "You are my payback.  I cannot take your money because I know exactly what they have done."  He said, "I'm a graduate of Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Hopkins [Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland] is patterned after the Harvard system.  And, I know exactly the tactics that they are using."  Make a long story short, we took it all the way up to the president's office.  And, Steven Muller, who was the president at the time, heard the case.  And, he brought in the head of the department and all the paperwork.  And, after he reviewed everything, he looked at me and he said, "Leslie [HistoryMaker Leslie King-Hammond], what do you want?"  I said, "I came here for a doctorate.  I'm not leaving without a doctorate, and I will write my own doctorate on the subject that I feel is worthy, with approval from the department."  He said, "Fine."  I wasn't the only student that was bounced out.  There was a student there who was from Morgan State University.  And, he said, "I want to be out of this school.  I don't wanna do another thing.  I want my degree and I don't wanna ever see you all again."  And, the president said, "Done."  And, then he told the two of us that he would continue the rest of the meeting without a (unclear) deliberation.  And, that we would be hearing from him shortly.  And, he stood up and shook both of our hands.  He apologized for the attitudes with which we had been treated.  And, he assured us that in the next few days this would be resolved, and he ushered us out the door.  Well, at the same time my department chair [Phoebe Baroody Stanton] who had been present in the meeting, got up to leave with us and as we went out the door, I heard him turn around and say to her, "Oh, no.  You're not leaving.  Sit down now."  And, with that in two days, I had a letter completely reinstating me with an even bigger fellowship from what I had before.  And, I went on to complete my doctorate.  And, out of the class of African Americans that came in, only three of us graduated.  So, the attrition rates were horrible, just horrendous.  And, part of them filling me out was a retaliation for me querying and demanding a responsible answer.  And, every time my two colleagues and I would go to a department, they would say to us, "Nobody questions us.  How dare you come and ask us these questions."  And, we said, "It's an academic institution, what happened to free speech?  What happened to the first right amendment [First Amendment]?"  You know, what, what is wrong here?  Or, is it that we are of African descent asking you why you deliberately in a sense, baited and switched all these students to come in?  You took affirmative action federal dollars.  They are gone, and you're trying to tell us that they were intellectually inferior?  We say, "How do you justify that?"  So.  Ask me now does Hopkins know who I am?  No (laughter), except when they come looking for alumni contributions (laughter).
Story_ID: 434984
Speaker 1: Juanita Jackson, you mentioned, is that Juanita Jackson Mitchell, who--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Oh, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Later married Clarence [Clarence M. Mitchell, Jr.]--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  The one and the same.
Speaker 1: Mitchell, Jr.?  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Right.  I just wanted to make sure that--
Speaker 2: That's exact--that was the lawyer.
Speaker 1: That was on record.
Speaker 2: She was the lawyer that started that.  And--
Speaker 1: Now, this a tradition amongst black lawyers, you know, going back to the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Howard law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.] and--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  When [HistoryMaker] Robert Mack Bell told me that, because he was a graduate of Morgan [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland], he said, "I can't take your money."  He said, "I am bound.  I am bound to do this."  He said, "I have to do this."  He said, "You're in trouble."  He says, "You're in the same trouble that historically has always kept graduate students from this."  And, now today, of course, now that I've risen in the charts in Baltimore [Maryland], I mean, I'm, you know, I'm hot stuff, all right.  Everybody knows my history because I just refuse to take, no.  I said, "Yes, I'm from New York [New York].  Yes, I know I can do whatever I wanna do.  Yes, I have multiple talents and I chose right now to get a doctorate.  I'm not choosing to be an artist right now," all right.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: And, you don't have the right.
Speaker 1: So, did they actually give you a Ph.D., or a M.F.A. or what was it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, no, no, no.  I got a Ph.D.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, it's a Ph.D. in--?
Speaker 2: I got a Doctorate of Philosophy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: With an emphasis in art history and the history of art.  No, I went the full, I went the full ride.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, this is 1971, right?
Speaker 2: This was 1970--now, I did my doctorate from 1969 to 1976.  Because it took me extra-long because I went through three department chairpersons.  They tried three times to get rid of me.  And, each time I foiled them.  The last department chair, the one who told me I was too talented was the second department chair.  The third one was a German, and he did not believe that I was intellectually capable.  So, he forced me to stay an extra year and do additional studies in Renaissance history.  And, do a private tutorial with him in German because he didn't believe I could speak German.  But, when I was in New York, in junior high school [P.S. 142, Shimer Junior High School, Queens, New York], I was part of an experimental group of Negroes who were given foreign language in their curriculum.  And, my mother [Evelyne Maxwell King] chose German for me over Spanish.  So, that was her payback.  It was like, "I told you so.  I told--" 'cause I would cuss her every day in my little way.  I would say, "Why are you making me take this German?  I hate it, I hate it, I hate it."  And, then when I got Hopkins [Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland] and I had this B.F.A. in fine arts but then I had also this strong background in art history.  But, I could speak German, you understand.  They went, "How did that happen?"  So, I was geek from way--you know, it was just, you know, geek dust fell on me from somewhere.  And, I had been studying German since I was in seventh grade, sixth, seventh grade.  Then, when I went to college at Queens College [Queens, New York], they had a foreign language requirement, so I rolled it over.  I did four years of study in German.
Story_ID: 434985
Speaker 1: Wasn't your primary instructor [at Queens College, Queens, New York], Aach [Herbert Aach], of German descent?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was of German descent, and my primary painting teacher was of German descent.  So, I was, I was thoroughly steeped in the tradition.  It was, you know--and, I had done all my research on Goethe's [Johann Wolfgang von Goethe] color theories, who I didn't know had all of these color theories.  And, that's why Hopkins [Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland] wanted me because I was one of the only graduate students they had ever seen who knew anything--you know, Goethe was known as a fabulous poet.  No one knew that he had these very complex theories about color.  And, my professor had published, just recently published a book.  So, they figured, "Ooh, we'll get her in here and we can get all the good stuff.  She'll tell us," you know, they say--well, I knew they brought me in because they thought I was gonna do something on Goethe.  But, then when they asked me what I was gonna do my dissertation topic on, I said, "I'm going to work on an African American subject because there are so few research studies done on African Americans in this country, and I wanna make a contribution to the field."  They said you--.  "I can always do Goethe.  I've already done Goethe, you all need to do Goethe.  I'm gonna do something that hasn't been done," okay.  So, that's when they knew they really had to get rid of me because I was told that there were no African American artists worthy of a doctorate from Hopkins.  So, here's what I did, walked across the street again.  Went over to the Baltimore Museum of Art [Baltimore, Maryland] which shares the same campus as Hopkins.  And, then hanging on the wall is an exhibition of a painter by the name of William Henry Johnson.  And, his works are from the period of 1930s and the '40s [1940s].  I'm looking at these paintings and they're black people.  And, they're black people with big hands, and big lips, and big nose, and big feet, and big toes, and I'm going, "Wait a minute.  How's a black man in the 1930s and 1940s paint images of black people like this without getting into some kinds of issues?"  So, every week I walk out of the museum.  Every week Hopkins had a bus going over to Washington, D.C., because they had an international research center [Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies, Washington, D.C.] over there, and I signed up for the bus.  This was all free.  I get on the bus and I go over and I tell the bus driver, "Let me off at the Smithsonian [Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.] where these, the bulk of these works are housed."  Walk into the Smithsonian, no appointment, and I find the chief curator who organized that show.  And, I say to her, her name was Adelyn Breeskin [Adelyn Dohme Breeskin], and I said, "Oh, my God, stop, stop."  I say to her, "Miss Breeskin," I said, "I'm from Johns Hopkins.  I'm with the graduate student and I wanna to my dissertation on William Henry Johnson."  She says, "Yes."  And, she grand dame, white woman, flaming white hair.  She was gorgeous, elegant.  At the time I'm talking to her, she has got to be--she's a curator emeritus.  She's got to be in her late seventies, early eighties.  And, she's just letting me talk.  And, I said, "What do you think you could do to help me do this study?"  She looked at me and she said, "I know who you are."  And, I almost died.  Because of course, this is in the aftermath of me being thrown out and doing the German tutorial and I'm going, "Okay, Leslie [HistoryMaker Leslie King-Hammond] get your game face 'cause when she says that, you don't know how much she knows."  She said, "I was on the advisory board of your fellowship when you first came in."  And, I went, "Oh, my God."  She said, "My dear, if you wanna do this thing on Johnson, you go right ahead 'cause nobody else knows what's going on and nobody else wants the topic."  So, I said, "I'm thrilled.  Thank you."  She says, "I'll give you the keys to the cage where all of the documents are locked and you can work as long as you want."  So, I said, "I'm having one problem."  She says, "What's that?"  I said, "My dissertation advisor and the chairman of the department does not believe that there is any topic where an African American is concerned that is worthy of a Hopkins dissertation."  And, she just looked at me just as cold, then says, "You have him give me a call immediately."  She said, "I'll take care of that."  She said, "How dare he not believe that the Smithsonian does not have anything worthy to do a research project on."
Story_ID: 434986
Speaker 1: All the while this department head is trying to get me to transfer to the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] where they had a black studies department because that's where black people go when they wanna study black people.  And, I kept saying, "No, this is art history department and I'm doing it on artists whose happens to be black and I'm not going to Michigan."  So, as we're passing the hall one day, and I had already told him who I was doing the topic on, he were passing the hall and he says, "Miss King [HistoryMaker Leslie King-Hammond]."  And, I said, "Yes."  He says, "I guess you're on your way to Scandinavia?"  And, I said, (gesture), "You got it."  Because he had gotten the call from the Smithsonian [Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.].  And, this director, excuse me, this curator [Adelyn Dohme Breeskin] had once been the director of the Baltimore Museum of Art [Baltimore, Maryland] for nearly twenty-five years.  So, she was the lead player in 20th century art at the Smithsonian, in Baltimore [Maryland], and she just picked up the phone and she said, "Excuse me, I think that this is a topic worth doing."  And, that's how I did it.  But, even up until I did my defense, he sat on the jury and he, he completely tried to malign me.  And, my jury committee later on told me that he was so bad before I came in the room that they had agreed that if I was monosyllabic and could only breathe like a pulsating blob of protoplasm, that I was going to pass because they found his behavior so abhorrent.  They said, he, "He was absolutely incensed that I was, that I was moving forward with the topic I wanted to do," having passed through every hoop that he had placed in my obstacle.
Story_ID: 434987
Speaker 1: That's also part of the history of the time.  Because you have to remember professors at that time like to co-op and control their female students sexually.  And, he was one of those who, who preyed upon my colleagues, my female counterparts in the department [at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland] to the point where they felt compromised to having sex with him because they felt their scholarships would be compromised.  And, when he came in for this interview, I, I watched him.  And, he, he scanned, he kind of visually undressed each female as he went from circle to circle, in the little cocktail sip.  Just, you know, undressing them with this gaze.  And, so, when he came to my circle, okay, and he was going around, locking eyes with each of the females in the circle and he got to me, I just quietly looked in his face and said, "Not in your wildest or wettest dreams."  I said, "Not today."  And, of course, David Boxer who was sitting there with wine in his mouth, spit it across the room.  Lowery Sims [Lowery Stokes Sims] was standing in the circle, grabbed me by my arm, 'cause she thought I was gonna killed.  She said, "Leslie [HistoryMaker Leslie King-Hammond], you're gonna get killed.  You just have to shut-up."  I said, "I can't."  I mean, this is just such profound ignorance, this is just so profound abuse, okay.  And, I said, "And, it wouldn't be so embarrassing if it weren't so damn true," okay.  He knew it.  I knew it.  And, I called him, okay.  And, from that day forward, all right, he was on my case.  I said, "That's your problem, not mine.  I'm not giving it up but I am walking out of here with the piece of paper I came for."  And, that's what I did.  And, as I walked out, I had already been hired by the Maryland Institute College of Art [Baltimore, Maryland], the premier art institution in the city to teach classes.  And, no sooner than three months after I completed my doctoral final exams and defenses, I was appointed in the following semester, dean of the graduate school.  Oh, yeah.  It was just, you know, one, one, one, you know, it was, it was like this snowball thing.  I (unclear) what is going on?  I didn't plan any of this.  It's like people say, "How did you do this in your life?"  I said, "Well, I fell backwards through the door of opportunity.  I was just sort of standing there, the window opened, I--breeze blew me through and I just decided, well, let's try this out and see where it takes you."  So, it's been a journey.
Story_ID: 434988
Speaker 1: So now we're at the Maryland Institute College of Art [Baltimore, Maryland].  You're a dean there.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, so, tell us about that experience.
Speaker 2: That was a very interesting experience.  I, I was asked--in fact, it goes back to Hopkins [Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland] because I was in grad school with a woman by the name of Arlene Raven and Lowery Sims [Lowery Stokes Sims].  And, Laurie Sims was my colleague from Queens College [Queens, New York].  Arlene Raven was knew when I came to grad school.  She was a colleague of mine at that time, and she was married to a gentlemen, Tim Corkery [Timothy Corkery] who was the dean of continuing studies.  And, she was looking for someone to teach courses on (air quotes) black art.  So, she came to me one day at seminar and, she said, "Look, my husband is teaching at this private art college, which is very distinguished."  The art college is one of the oldest in the country, 1926 [sic. 1826].  And, she said, you know, "You might, you know, ultimately we're all looking for teaching jobs and you could use the money."  So, I agreed to start teaching classes there.  And, as I began to teach these (air quotes) black art classes, I then increased to teaching the surveys from ancient to Gothic to Renaissance and the whole survey courses.  And, then they began to ask me to teach other kinds of courses.  And, in the interim, I was still on a part-time status.  The job of the dean of the graduate school came open.  So, I said to myself, "You know," the job market was kind of flat at that time, because we were in an era of recession.  This is '70s [1970s].  And, so, you didn't have a whole lot.  You couldn't even be guaranteed that your courses would fill because people didn't have money to buy gas to put in the car to drive to classes.  So, you were taking like catch-as-catch-can.  So, I just took a risk and threw my hat in the ring and applied for the job.  At the time, the president who was there was new and he was trying to make a statement.  And, that following spring he appointed me dean of the graduate school during an open faculty meeting to which the audience gasped such a loud awe of shock that I just sat there and went, "Oh, God what have I done?"  Because I had the interview in February.  No one ever heard anything.  I thought the president had chosen someone else.  And, when we walked into the May faculty meeting, at the end of the semester he say, "Oh, Leslie [HistoryMaker Leslie King-Hammond], I'm so glad you're here.  I have an announcement to make."  And, I went, "Fine.  Could you share it with me before you make it if it has anything to do with me?"  He said, "Oh, no, no, no, this will be a good thing," okay.  So, I sit down in the corner of the auditorium like this (covers eyes with hand) because I'm dying.  I don't know.  I don't--I truly don't have clue what he's going to say.  He appoints me.  The whole campus goes into shock.
Story_ID: 434989
Speaker 1: And I began one of the most interesting aspects of my professional career in having to build a graduate school at an institution [Maryland Institute College of Art, Baltimore, Maryland] where a graduate education has been a peripheral secondary concern.  And, now, I have one of the foremost graduate schools in the country.  I am probably one of maybe now, only two or three academic deans of color who run a graduate school or who exist at a senior post.  But, while I was doing that, I made it a caveat that I would continue to teach in the classroom.  Because I did not want to become soft or lose the focus of what educating an artist was about.  Besides, I loved being in the classroom.  I just love teaching.  I love students.  I love, I love the students at that school.  So, while I was teaching and while I was running these graduate schools, I'm running all over the country recruiting, the president [Fred Lazarus IV] came to me because he thought, this is the next president, the third president under my tenure.  He thought that because I was a black woman that I would be able to attract more students of color to the graduate programs.  And, I had to remind him that money was of considerable importance.  And, he said, "I have contacts with the Ford Foundation [New York, New York].  If I get some money, can you find the students?"  I said, "No, you get the money.  I know where the students are."  So, we began a project with Philip Mor- with Ford Foundation which was later grandfathered by Philip Morris [Philip Morris Inc.; Altria Group, Inc.].  And, for a twelve year period, from 1985 to about 1997, I worked with four other schools including the Yale School of Art [New Haven, Connecticut], Cranbrook Academy of Art [Bloomfield Hills, Michigan], California Institute of the Arts [Los Angeles, California], and the School of the Art Institute of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], right here, to bring artists of color back to get their M.F.A. degrees which are parallel to Ph.D.'s.  Those are the terminal degrees.  And, during that period of time, I think I got at least, I wasted not one dollar.  I lost not one student, not in any year.  I used every fellowship.  And, I think we graduated over two hundred and twenty artists from that program.  Primary initiative of that program was to make sure that we would be stocking academia with leadership and, and professionals who could carry on the legacy of teaching in the classroom as well as being fund--professional artists and designers into that end and we have succeed with that.  Our only mistake is that we never hired any of those people at our school.  So, there goes our diversity factor.
Story_ID: 434990
Speaker 1: Well who are some of the people that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Some of them are right here, [HistoryMaker] Dawoud Bey.  And, he came out of Yale [Yale School of Art, New Haven, Connecticut].  [HistoryMaker] Nick Cave, Nick Cave is up here.
Speaker 1: Right, he's down the street.
Speaker 2: He's right down the street.  And, Nick Cave came out of Cranbrook [Cranbrook Academy of Art, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan].  Pat Ward Williams came out of MICA [Maryland Institute College of Art, Baltimore, Maryland], she's a photographer.  I'm, I'm trying to give you the big names in the different locales.  We had, in Baltimore [Maryland], we had a wonderful artist by the name of Tom Miller, who went on to be probably the first artist that the city adopted to create a proposal that was submitted to the federal government when they were giving those hundred million dollar empowerment zone grants.  The City of Baltimore commissioned Tom Miller to create the proposal.  And, Tom Miller actually designed each chapter, front page, the cover, so that it was a gorgeous art book filled with all of this statistical documentation to substantiate this hundred million dollar competition by urban cities, and we won.  It was a fabulous, just a fabulous moment for us.  We had artist who came in from Federica Carraia [ph.] who came out of Virginia.  We had artist who here in Chicago [Illinois] passed away, Renee Townsend, was a brilliant sculptor.  And, unfortunately succumb to an unfortunate asthma attack.  Chicago was one of our base camps.  We, we did very well with artists from this area.  And, we also had a number of artist that came out of California.  And, we, we, we're not able to make as greater impact within the Native American community.  But, with African Americans which is what we had originally targeted, we were very, very successful.
Story_ID: 434991
Speaker 1: Now you served on panels with NEA [National Endowment for the Arts] and such, you know (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, God, yes.
Speaker 1: How--I know the complaints from black arts organizations, and I don't know about the individual artist, though we had a big fiasco here back in the '80s [1980s] around black arts here in our citywide art exhibit where they were all, there was blind judging of the, of the pieces.  But the people that sat on the, in judgment were people who'd gone to school with the artist that submitted (laughter).  So, I mean, it's, you know, there only, I think one black artist and two Hispanics were chosen out of like two hundred artists (laughter).  You know, it's--
Speaker 2: See, during that period it was, there was this, I need to say something that's very important about that.  When the Black Arts Movement and the gay liberation movement and the feminist movement came about, a lot of it was due to the fact that these different special interest target constituency groups had a specific voice or aesthetic message to give out.  Because the mainstream or the conical western ideologies only recognized one form of thought or vision or execution.  As all of these other new voices, and when I say other, I mean the big O, because we went from little O to big O, otherness as indifference.  As all of this otherness came about, all of the dominant populations had no clue at what they were looking at.  They had no way to contextualize.  This is how the culture voice came about because people were, were battling for a seat at the table.  Meaning, who has the right, who has the permission, who has the authority to have this discussion, who makes these decisions?  And, when you don't have two people on the panels, on the juries, on the committees, at the administrative post, it's just very clear to me that if I had not been the graduate dean at this particular school [Maryland Institute College of Art, Baltimore, Maryland], how many students would not have gotten in?  Because there was nobody there to authenticate or say, "This is a voice that needs to be at this table."  It may look different.  It may function different.  It may walk different.  It may see different, smell different, but it does not undermine the importance of what they bring to the table in this world called art, which is supposed to be open ended and ever changing and evolving.  And, if you don't have a voice that can argue and lobby for that--I just sat on a panel just recently in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And, the proposals that came through, several of them were from organizations of color.  And, unless you understand where they're trying go and what they're trying to do, and who the personnel have been, who are the personnel who have been hired to executive this.  If you don't understand those, then you can't articulate it to your white peers in a manner that they understand it and recognize it as viable.
Story_ID: 434992
Speaker 1: We had a proposal on a major white artist coming out of South Africa, and here we are having the argument around the table.  I am the only woman of color.  There were some Korean and some Chinese at the table.  But, I am the only woman of African descent.  And, they're having a discussion about this proposal where they're trying to dismiss the proposal in the flip end of being PC, politically correct.  In that, he's a famous white artist and he will continue to have opportunities so we don't really need to do this because this institution is going to do the show anyway.  That's when I put a pause.  I said, "Excuse me, let's examine the proposal more clearly."  In his proposal you have to recognize the fact that he is working collaboratively, with collectives of artists who are of color.  Now, are we asking ourselves the question about what is the relationship that he sees with these collectives?  How have these collectives, their lives, their energies, their aesthetics change by his intervention to use the word?  What difference is that going to make?  And, because you might not be especially compelled by the project because it is of a female focus and has strong female overtones, I didn't say feminist, I said female.  Meaning soft and, you know, maybe fibery or all of those things that are not hard and firm that are associated with male context.  I said, "Does that diminish the importance of the project and the support that it deserves?"  Now, that's just a minor argument for one little small proposal, which may or may not get funded.  I don't know.  I don't know what the end shot will be because I'm just an advisory member on a committee, and I give my recommendation for it.  But, after the jury was over, several of my colleagues, white, came up to me and they said, "You know, that was a very compelling argument and you made us really reconsider how to approach work."  So, all I'm saying is, is that you must have people who participate in the discourse, in the decision making power if you're going to have that kind of parity and you're going to have that kind of inclusion, do you understand, within the totality of the experience.  Otherwise, it's the same ol' same ol'.  It's the same people making the same decision with the same projects that get the same support all the time and then nothing ever changes.
Story_ID: 434993
Speaker 1: In the '80s [1980s], I don't know if I want to go too far ahead but--
Speaker 2: Go anywhere.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Doesn't bother me.
Speaker 1: I should go back.  Okay (pause).  Well, tell us, well, tell us about some of your publications and then we'll start, go with that, and then we'll go back to (unclear) and pick up.
Speaker 2: I started publishing because it was nothing out, they were insufficient and I did not know how to write.  But, I learned how to write.  And, I wrote because if I didn't write about that particular project or exhibition at that time, there would be no record of it.  And, part of the problem of history is is that if you don't take responsibility to write your history, you won't have a history because it will be lost.  And, so, I have always tried to whatever project I was working on whatever organization or museum or exhibition opportunity to make sure that there was a publication for the sake of the artist and the sake of the institution.  I'm not nearly as interested that, you know, it was me that wrote it and I own it because I don't believe I own history.  I'm just part of it.  And, lately more and more increasingly when I write, my position is to write from the voice of the artist.  So, I see myself as a vehicle, as a facilitator, as a go between, to help make it happen.  I don't, you know, sit--you know, I enjoy, I love writing.  I love researching.  It's just an excuse for me to be nosey.  It justifies me going through papers and sorting out problems and piecing history.  And, it goes back to my days and my love of archeology and geology and the gem stones and where they come from and the stories that they tell us.  I love stories.  I'm a story teller.  I think that that's how people evolve.  I think that's how people carry on their history and their traditions.  And, if you tell a story, it doesn't matter if it's the same old story, it's how you tell the story so that people remember it.  And, they get something from the meaning of it every time they hear it.  That's what most ritual and tradition is about away.  It's just a recapitulation over and over of similar kinds of information.  But, then it transmits to a sustaining experience which allows people to grow and connect themselves to other experiences or other human beings.  So, that's what writing becomes for me.  It's a fabulous way to tell a story.  And, I, I try really hard to tell the story well within the integrity of the voice of the person or persons or groups that I'm working with.  Because historically, the writing, especially about artists, was co-opted away from artist because it was believed artists couldn't write.  Meaning they couldn't think.  That they were anomalistic to the degree that, you know, they were maybe idiot-savants.  But, they could create these miraculous things but my God, speak, talk, you know they're kind of geeky, they're kind of strange, they're kind of off the Richter scale, they're kind of off on the, on the blind side of the radar.  But, artists are extremely articulate.  Even if they speak in a phrase or a sentence, it's loaded, it dense with meaning because they think about what they do a lot if not all the time.  Sometimes to the disadvantage of the people who share the communal space with them because they're so completely immersed or absorbed in those experiences.  So, I like to, to take those experiences and place them in a context where if I saw somebody walking across the street and I gave them my manuscript that they could read it.  I don't like to write in language that is so abtract--abstract or so full of theories that, you know, I could easily get myself lost and surely if I'm lost, everybody else is going to be lost.  What I want to do is do what the artist does.  And, this is because I've been given the privilege, and it is a privilege.  My whole education, my whole life has been a privilege.  I am unorthodox.  I didn't plan it.  I saw opportunity.  I seized it, and I worked with it.  But, my, my mission, my personal mission is that it is so critical that this experience that the artist creates for the world, for the audience be accessible to that audience.  And, if in my writing I can be that bridge, then I feel I satisfied my mission.
Story_ID: 434994
Speaker 1: Now, I think the story of black art, I know I first came across it in the presence of [HistoryMaker] David Driskell back in '71 [1971] showing slides.  He was at Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] then.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: He was showing slides of black artists, here's Horace Pippin, here's Charles White [Charles Wilbert White] and different--Jacob Lawrence and others.  Faith Ringgold, that, you know, so, now that's--and, yet today probably you could go to a school and have art history course and never have a black artists mentioned.
Speaker 2: Absolutely. Still today.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Still, yeah.
Speaker 2: I--even in my school [Maryland Institute College of Art, Baltimore, Maryland], I have student come to take my class because, if they've taken a regular survey course, there're just names and artist who just never come up.  They're not even--they still, this is 2007, they are still not part of the culture, the intellectual landscape of our nation, or our society, of world, 'cause we're not global.  It's no longer just the Americas.  It's no longer just the United States.  This is like, once the Internet, once computers came into the being, we, we are now in contact with the next person on the other side of the world within seconds.  So, we still haven't gotten there in seeing ourselves as a whole humanity, worthy of investigation, worthy of information to be recognized and to be exhibited to display, to be enjoyed.  To have meaning.  So, we're still fighting that fight.  That fight is still alive and unfortunately too well, it's too palpable.  It's very disturbing sometimes that we still haven't gotten there.
Story_ID: 434995
Speaker 1: Tell us a little about--about some of the shows you've been the curator of.
Speaker 2: Well, let me telling you something--okay, let me tell you some fun shows, some really good shows.  Two shows that I did at the same time, I don't sleep much, obviously.  When I look back at my old resume I go, "Oh, my God."  I did two shows that I thought were really important and very, very different.  And, they were in like, 1988 and 1989.  One was called, 'Black Printmakers and the WPA.'  Where I literally had to search for prints, linoleum prints, woodcut, silk screen, lithographs, done by African American artists during the period of the Great Depression.
Speaker 1: Now, what year is this?
Speaker 2: This was, I did the show in '88 [1988], '89 [1989].  And, it was a show that premiered in New York [New York].  And, it forced me to go to different cities, New York, Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], Cleveland [Ohio] where they had some of the more active programs and pull out the prints that were made.  And, the joy of that particular exhibition was that at the opening many of the artists were still alive.  And, when they came to the opening and they saw all the things they had--I had found, they were absolutely awed.  Because at the time that they were involved in the experience of print making in these community centers or these graphic workshops, they had no idea that, one, this work was important; two, that this work would even survive;  or three, that anybody would be interested in it.  Because for the majority of them, this was a new experience.  They were, they were experimenting.  This was the first time they had open access to materials, equipment, and tools, and to each other.  So, that was a pure, that was just absolutely a pure joy to do because we did get a catalog out it.  We got an excellent exhibition.
Story_ID: 434996
Speaker 1: Well, at the time, just after that, I had been asked by the president [Fred Lazarus IV] of my school who was quickly realizing that I was doing shows for everybody else.  Meaning, other museums and institutions.  And, I hadn't done anything on behalf of our school with its name or its imprint on it.  And, he said, "Leslie [HistoryMaker Leslie King-Hammond], do you think you can do a show for us?"  He said, you know, "You're all over the place with doing this Ford Foundation [New York, New York] project," he says, "and, you're curating all this stuff.  Can you?"  I said, "Sure."  So, I went to my friends Lowery Sims [Lowery Stokes Sims] and I said, "Lowery, now they're asking for a show."  I said, "Let's do something out of the box."  So, she and I had been having this game.  And, every February we would say, "Okay, what are you doing for Black Hysterical Month?"  She would say to me, "What are you doing for Black Hysterical Month?"  Because everybody always called at the last minute and we would have to go and do the dog and pony show.  So, I said, "Lowery, let's take our Black History Month shows, okay, lectures that we do and turn them into an exhibition."  She said, "Fine."  So, we said, "Well, what do you wanna base it on?"  So, we talked back and forth and we decided that the question would be, since it was 1988, 1989, and we were ten years away from the millennium, what would black artist be doing when the millennium breaks?  What are they gonna look like?  Okay.  I don't wanna show the same old stuff because [HistoryMaker] David Driskell had set that standard.  David--nobody did that better than David.  But, also the question was always, artists are always advancing.  They're always testing, experimenting, what else are they gonna do?  What else do you envision them doing?  So, we put together a show where we invited twelve artists to come and put work together and we called the show 'Art as a Verb: The Evolving Continuum of African American Art' [sic. 'Art as a Verb: The Evolving Continuum: Installations, Performances and Videos by 13 Afro-American Artists'].  And, in this show we applied to three to four foundations.  And, basically each proposal said, one, we're doing a show on African American artists; we're asking them to look at what are the materials they're using and what's happening in the next ten years.  And, we don't know what they gonna do for the show.  So, basically, we were asking for money to support a show and we didn't know what the checklist was gonna look like.  All we knew was, we had the artists.  And, do you know we got funded by every agency we applied to.  And, we did the show.  It opened at the Maryland Institute College of Art [Baltimore, Maryland].  We designed it around students so that it would be a teaching forum so students could come in and work with the artist.  A lot of the artist did installations and talked about the nature of their role with the environment, with urban centers with their spirituality, with their psychology, and it was an absolutely fascinating fun show, right down to the live rooster I had to go find.
Story_ID: 434997
Speaker 1: The live--I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: Rooster.  You know like, cock-a-doodle-doo.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yes.  One of the artists had passed away because he was a Vietnam veteran and had been afflicted with Agent Orange.  And, another artist came in to do his installation and when he finishes--finished the installation, his name was Charles Abramson, the artist who passed.  His colleague, Jorge Rodriguez said, "Leslie [HistoryMaker Leslie King-Hammond], in order to complete this exhibition I need a live white rooster."  Well, Jorge and Charles Abramson had been practitioners of Santeria.  And, their work was very much about the new world religions what African people practice in the United States and the Caribbean and in Brazil.  And, so, four days before the exhibition opened after I had promised that I would find this rooster, I didn't have a rooster.  And, I was feeling really guilty and I was feeling really panicked because I wanted this show to be best show that the city and region had seen because it was going to travel to New York [New York].  So, the press, the communications director of our school had scheduled me to do an interview on a local TV station to talk about this 'Artist of Verb' exhibition ['Art as a Verb: The Evolving Continuum: Installations, Performances and Videos by 13 Afro-American Artists'].  And, I went to the TV station to talk about it.  And, while I'm talking about it the interviewer is, you know, during the break saying, "Okay, we're going," okay, I said, "Fine."  She says, "Do you have anything else you wanna say?"  I said, "Yes."  At the end of my interview I said, "I have to make a plea because I need a, a rooster."  She did, "A rooster?"  And, I said, "I need a live white rooster."  She said, "Okay."  So, the cameramen are all around, okay.  And, you see their knees starting to buckle, okay, 'cause they're trying not to laugh and I'm going, "I know you all are laughing.  I know we're going back on the air, but I'm gonna get you."  So, we go back on the air, and so she says, "Dr. Hammond, do you have anything else you wanna say?"  And, I go, "Yes."  I said, "I would like to ask the audience to bear with me because I have one special need."  I said, "I need to get a live white rooster to be in the exhibition in honor of one of the artist who passed who was a Vietnam Veteran."  I said, "I'm not going to kill the rooster. Not gonna hurt the rooster.  I'm not gonna cook the rooster, and I'll give the rooster back."
Story_ID: 434998
Speaker 1: I am asking the audience for a live white rooster that I will not hurt, maim, cook, kill, whatever.  And, I just need the rooster for twenty-four hours.  And, would you please call me, you understand, if you have a rooster that you can loan me.  Well, the cameras cut.  It--cameramen are on the floor laughing.  The, the host is like hysterical because she's off camera, okay.  She's--tears are rolling her eyes, I said, "That's okay.  You all can laugh at me, it's all right, I don't care.  I need a rooster."  I'm obsessed, "I need a rooster, okay."  Remind you now, I have called every veterinarian in town.  I have called every petting zoo, everything.  When I called the veterinarians, they laugh, they think I'm a voodoo queen, that I'm gonna do something with the rooster.  So, as I'm leaving the TV station and go out into the lobby, in those days the receptionist was out in the public area, and I hear this receptionist screams at the top of her lung, "Who the hell asked for a live white rooster.  The switchboard's lit up like a--," and I go, "Oh, my God."  So, as I go out the door I say to the receptionist, I said, "Tell them to call this telephone number," which was the school [Maryland Institute College of Art, Baltimore, Maryland] number.  I forgot to give the number.  I didn't even think anybody--I was so used to--I'm an abused child.  I think everybody is gonna ignore me.  I get back to campus, I'm walking up to my building going into the front door where there's a big gallery.  And, here come four of my white colleagues, women.  And, they look at me and they go, "So, why didn't you tell us you wanted a white cock?  We know where they are, we have all kinds.  What kind would you like?"  And, I'm standing there, I'm like (laughter), "Oh, I can't take any more.  I can't take anymore.  Does anybody have a rooster?"  Later on that afternoon somebody on campus calls me up, one of my administrative assistants, she says, "Leslie [HistoryMaker Leslie King-Hammond], I live on a farm, I have about five white roosters, how many do you want?"  So, I got Rudy.  Rudy came.  He was in a cage, and he danced around and made a fabulous sand pattern on the floor [for the 'Art as a Verb: The Evolving Continuum: Installations, Performances and Videos by 13 Afro-American Artists' exhibition].  So, when we returned Rudy, do you understand, we had the pattern, we had the thing.  But, those are the--two of the exhibitions that I just had the most fun with and were the most historically significant in terms of making an impact on the field.  I mean, I've done many, many other exhibitions and things but those two are really important.
Speaker 2: Okay. Now this sounds like this is a big deal, the 'Hale Woodruff Biennial,' at the Studio Museum [Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, New York]?
Speaker 1: Oh, that was part of the Ford [Ford Foundation, New York, New York], Philip Morris [Philip Morris Inc.; Altria Group, Inc.] exhibition of students that I had mentored through the fellowship program [Fellowships for Artists of Color] and that was an exhibition of their works.  And, it was really a, a special moment in history for young emerging artists.  And, it was the appropriate place for that show to happen.
Story_ID: 434999
Speaker 1: Now, did you get married at some time along there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, by that time, I was married and divorced.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: And, had a child.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, had another relationship, had adopted another child.  So, by this time, I'm a free agent.  I was, I'm not really good at marriage (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, when did you get married the first time?
Speaker 2: I got married the first time in about 1976, '75 [1975], '76 [1976].
Speaker 1: This is right after the Ph.D.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right after the Ph.D., right around there, I got married [to O'Neill T. Hammond].  And, then we bought a house and then I had a son [Rassaan Hammond].  I had a child in '79 [1979] and then by '82 [1982] it was over.  And, then I had another relationship and this gentleman had a son [Terrence Hinton] already who was like two years older than my natural son.  And, that lasted a couple of years, and then that didn't work.  And, then the little boy said to me, "Well, do I have to go, too?"  And, I said, "You didn't mess up."  So, I raised the two of them until they were like, well, the one just turned, the oldest one is thirty and other one is gonna be twenty-eight.  So, basically, I've been a single parent for the majority of my life.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  And, let's see now, just to, I thought I'd ask that 'cause I thought we'd probably passed it at some point.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But, even though now I have a partner.  And, he is my collaborative partner not only in my personal life but also he is my artistic collaborator because we create art together now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, that happened in--?
Speaker 2: That happened in 2000, about 2000, 2001.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Friends introduced us and we were old and difficult and took us a couple of years to realize that we might have common ground.  And, then when we did realize it, it just took off like (makes sound) (laughter).  And, the next thing you know we were making art together, so.  He's an architect.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Jose Mapily [HistoryMaker Jose J. Mapily].  And, we also have a jewelry design business so we go all over the world hunting for gems, back to geology.  And, make jewelry that we sell to museums.
Story_ID: 435000
Speaker 1: It's so many exhibits.  I mean, I've got a, got a list here.  It's one exhibit after another; 'Three Generations of African American Women Sculptors' ['Three Generations of African American Women Sculptors: A Study in Paradox'] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, that was another good one.  That's a really important one.  That one was sponsored by the Pew Charitable Trusts out of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And, that came about as a result of doing some research that had been done by Tritobia Benjamin [Tritobia Hayes Benjamin] who is the dean of the college of arts at Howard University [Howard University College of Arts and Sciences, Washington, D.C.], about the role of African American women sculptors.  And, at the time, I was acting as consultant for the Philadelphia African American Museum [African American Museum in Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And, what had happened is, is that as the research began to be developed it appeared that a significant number of women from the Philadelphia region became sculptors.  And, the paradox of that was that in history as African Americans became freed agents, the men went on to become largely painters.  And, the women went on to become sculptors.  So, what we did was, we created an exhibition called, 'Three Generations of African American Women Sculptors: A Study in Paradox,' because it was truly an anomaly because sculpture is clearly in the male domain.  And, male sculptors and male curators and male critics never really, in history, worked to support the vision of women sculptors, regardless of their color.  They just were thought to be weak and girlish and unbecoming for females to do that kind of work.  And, so, we told the story of about, nine black females from Edmonia Lewis all the way up to Barbara Chase-Riboud, and [HistoryMaker] Elizabeth Catlett, and [HistoryMaker] Geraldine McCollough, and about three or four, four or five WPA [Works Progress Administration; Work Projects Administration] artists from the '30s [1930s] and the '40s [1940s] looking at modernism.  And, that was a wonderful project.  And, I traveled the entire United States for about two or three years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know, rece- just about, about fifteen years ago, they discovered Edmonia Lewis out in the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --graveyard here.  I'm not sure--
Speaker 2: Right.  Right here--
Speaker 1: --buried--
Speaker 2: --which is now in the national gallery [Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, D.C.].  Yes.  And, it was upside down, and yeah, they can't figure out how it got there.  Except that the records from the period in the 1890s, around '96 [1896], '97 [1897], '98 [1898], indicate that that piece ['The Death of Cleopatra,' Edmonia Lewis] was on exhibit in one of the Chicago [Illinois] exhibitions, yeah.
Story_ID: 435001
Speaker 1: Yeah, it seems, you know, you wonder how can a piece of sculpture get lost.  I mean, a monumental piece like that ['The Death of Cleopatra,' Edmonia Lewis].
Speaker 2: Well, that was, that was the fascinating part about doing the research on that research on that women's sculptor project ['Three Generations of African American Women Sculptors: A Study in Paradox'] because we literally had to hunt down, and the earlier the artist were in history the difficult they were.  And, at one point, I had very few pieces of sculpture for an artist by the name of May Howard Jackson.  And, brilliant, brilliant sculptor who was also very good friends with W.E.B. Du Bois.  So, I'm calling schools, I'm calling schools, I'm calling schools, and one day I called this school, and you know, I call the school and I say hello, my name, I'm working this project for an exhibition and I'm looking for these sculptures.  Well, usually they didn't refer me straight to registrar.  So, I get to the registrar and I do the whole routine again, and this is like after maybe about, oh, I don't know, maybe fifteen or twenty calls that I've been making all over the United States.  And, they transfer me to this registrar and I repeat my whole spiel again, kind of methodically.  And, the guy just pauses and he goes, "Yep, I have about ten or twelve right here on the shelf."  And, I almost fell off my chair.  I almost died.  I said, "What do you mean?"  He said, "Well, I believe they were supposed to be given to Howard University [Washington, D.C.] but there was some kind of disagreement that occurred and we needed up with them."  He said, "But, they're not really in good shape."  I said, "What do you mean, they're not in good shape?"  He said, "Well, sometime maybe in the '60s [1960s] or the '70s [1970s], the students were having a carnival and they spray painted them."  I said, so you know, and Edmonia Lewis being lost in Chicago [Illinois], upside down in a landfill or sculptures by May Howard Jackson being located in a college but nobody thought they were important enough to preserve them, so students came along and spray painted them and used them for some carnival.  All kinds of atrocities have been committed.  The only thing I was concerned about was that at least we have the sculptors--sculptures, we know where they are and they can be restored.  Basically, they were plaster sculptures and they were spray painted but that can be removed to retain the quality.
Story_ID: 435002
Speaker 1: But, those kind of stories were not uncommon at all.  I mean, people just throwing out the work of these women artists.  They just, "Okay, she died.  Or, she left them, so where is dump, where's the nearest dump, dump," you know.  Or, the converse that some of these artists would get so upset that they were not getting any recognition, that they did not have anything, anyone to support them or cast their work.  They would destroy it themselves.  They just take these gorgeous pieces, just break them, throw them off the side of a building, take a hammer, just, you know, in a fit of frustration.  Because they were just, you know, I called myself a geek.  Could you imagine what they called themselves, all right, at that time with nobody supporting them and looking at them saying, "Well, why aren't you home having babies?"  You know, "Where's your husband?"  I mean, Meta Warrick Fuller [Meta Vaux Warrick Fuller] was from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and her husband [Solomon Carter Fuller] was this big time doctor.  And, when they married he said, "Oh, no, you are just not going to be making sculpture anymore.  You, you must be the wife.  You must come take care of the children."  And, she did that.  She was a wife.  She was taking care of the children.  But, Meta Warrick Fuller also had her own money, and she didn't even tell her husband.  But, walk down the road, a ways down from the house, and had them build a studio.  And, it wasn't until--he found out sometime later that when she was not at home during the day, she was down there in her studio.  And, this is a woman who studied Rodin [Auguste Rodin], okay.  And, she's gotta convince her educated black husband, you understand, that, "Hey, I'm a sculptor.  I'm always gonna be a sculptor."  But, these, these are the stories and the stories are phenomenal, absolutely phenomenal.  Elizabeth Prophet [Nancy Elizabeth Prophet], when Elizabeth Prophet who came out of Providence, Rhode Island, finally found her way to France to study because France was where you went to study art.  She gets over there.  She has barely any money.  She has barely any resources.  She gets so sick, so devastatingly ill that a friend comes over, sees what poor condition she is and takes her to the hospital.  She gets to the hospital and they say, "Well, what do you do?"  She says, "Well, I'm a sculptor, I have an Italia, I make sculpture.  And, I, I just didn't have enough money and I'm not sure what it is.  But, you know, I haven't eaten in a while."  Woman was starving to death.  But the hospital thought that she was drug addict, okay.  So, these are, these are the kinds of things that were consistent, absolutely consistently happening to women like this throughout history.  And, these stories are just, they're just incredulous, but they must be told.  And, the works have to be brought out because these are the women that were defining, taking authority over how to image blackness.  What is a Negro?  What does it look like?  Why is it beautiful?  Why is it fascinating?  All of these questions, which are the sole domain of these artists to take command?  So, that's my, I'm, I'm passionately in love with these stories.  I, I just--and, that's why I do these exhibitions.  You know, all of these exhibitions have a story, they have a reason why.  These are not exhibitions where I recapitulate something that's already been done.  I'm looking for a new twist, a new venue, a new way to think about something.  Or, I'm looking for an opportunity to showcase young artists who have not had a means to get their work out.  And, people now know that I like to do good shows.  I don't like to do tacky work.  I don't like to compromise my aesthetic, you know, my standards.  And, if I'm going to be a facilitator for an artist, if I'm gonna be an advocate for an artist, I want them to be in the best possible situation.
Story_ID: 435003
Speaker 1: Now, in terms of your own art, now, I have, here's something here that I have, 'Barbadian Spirits Revisited: Health and Healing' [sic. 'Barbadian Spirits: Altar for My Grandmother Ottalie Adalese Maxwell (1882-1991),' Leslie King-Hammond] at the Smithsonian [Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.], its Anacostia Museum [Anacostia Community Museum, Washington, D.C.].  Now this is your own work--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --honoring your ancestries on some level, right?
Speaker 2: That's right.  That's right.  I use in my art, my art has, when I allowed for myself to enter the public arena it became very clear to me that my family and my ancestral heritage was the primary impetus for why I do what I do.  As well as, my gender, and as well as my ethnicity as it has evolved within this 20th century, 21st century context.  So, I am fascinated as a woman with how we use popular material objects to create sights and places that are sacred but have meaning for individuals or just personal meaning.  So, my first piece, major piece that I did was an altar to my [maternal] grandmother [Ottalie Adalese Maxwell] who I call my first muse.  Wherein I recall her pantry and all of the things she had in it that she used to make us well, make us feel good.  As well as, all of the things that women use to decorate or make specific the spaces that they work in that register standards of beauty.  So, I would use a lot of anonymous found objects made by women; handmade doilies and lacy things and embroidered towels and plates, even broken plates.  I use food stuff like rice, and herbs, aromatics, fresh Eucalyptus because eucalyptus is a natural healer made for teas and poultices so forth, rubbing or drawing out toxins from the body.  So, I, you know, I mix, that's my alchemy.  That's the stuff I do.
Story_ID: 435004
Speaker 1: However, lately and then I did an altar for 9/11 [September 11, 2001].  I did an altar for the warrior spirits of 9/11 because that was such a traumatic moment in history and that one just came out of nowhere.  I just was compelled to do it.  And, that went on to be showcased in Ms. Magazine for the year, 2001 Women of the Year, as a sight of commemoration.  And, then it was also reinstalled in an exhibition ['The Art of 9/11'] by Arthur Danto [Arthur C. Danto] at apexart gallery [New York, New York].  And, in between that, I started to--right after that, I started to do collaborative sculpture with my partner Jose Mapily [HistoryMaker Jose J. Mapily] as a joke.  Not a joke but a challenge.  And, Bernice Steinbaum who's a gallery dealer in Miami [Florida] challenge Jose and I to be in an exhibition where she had asked artist and architects to collaborate.  And, we made a thing, he and I made a thing called, 'The Magic Birdhouse' [ph.].  And, since he's an architect he did his part of it in acrylic and the theme was kind of a quirky theme based on Magic Johnson and--oh God, what's his name?  I was doing so well up 'til now.
Speaker 2: Was this another basketball player?
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, white guy, Larry Bird.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Larry Bird and Magic Johnson.  And, so what we did was a reconfiguration and a play on themes where he created a little acrylic birdhouse.  And, I created a basketball out of sequences and beads, glass beads that had all kinds of icons and insignias that talked about the two teams that they represented.  And, before the piece ever got to be exhibited in Miami, it was sold.  Guess who bought it.
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: Jonathan and Richard.
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Jonathan Green and--
Speaker 1: Richard Weedman.  They saw the piece, we had stopped there on our way to Miami and they said, Richard said, "Whose is that?"  We said, "Nobody's."  He says, "I'm buying it now."  And, we had to call the dealer and find out what the price was.  Because we had literally just shipped it one week ago for the exhibition.  Well, that led to the next piece which was the 'Praise House' ['Celestial Praise House for Seneca Village,' Jose J. Mapily and Leslie King-Hammond] for Seneca Village [New York, New York] which was huge.  And, this one was a very, very frightening piece.
Story_ID: 435005
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tell us about Seneca Village.  Now, this is a special place in New York [New York], right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Yeah.  Seneca Village was a real sight in New York City, located in what is now Central Park.  And, it was located on the, in the area of Central Park West between 82nd Street to 89th Street.  And, it was a village, a real village that had over three hundred people, three churches, a greenhouse, a school, several graveyards, oh, at least six or seven tracks of farm land, cultivated.  At least six to eight of the families were either Irish and/or German.  But, it was an integrated community and it had an integrated church.  And, it functioned between for over thirty years, this village.  From between about the late 1820s to about 1854 when it was displaced by eminent domain.  And, the rationale for the eminent domain was that the City of New York had outgrown its spaces, downtown around Wall Street and the waterfront.  And, they needed to find a sight to create another reservoir.  And, they knew that these African Americans who lived in Seneca Village who had purchased their freedom.  Who had then worked and purchased the land they built their houses on.  Because the land maps show their names, show the churches and how many plots they owned.  The city fathers believed that this space was far more desirable for far more worthy people and those pickaninnies should leave.  And, so, they were displaced.  And what came was Olmsted's [Frederick Law Olmsted] plan for Central Park.  Jose [HistoryMaker Jose J. Mapily] and I were asked to do a commissioned piece for an exhibition at the New-York Historical Society [New York, New York] called, 'Legacies: Contemporary Artists Look at Slavery,' or respond to slavery. That's what it was, 'Contemporary Artist Respond to Slavery' [sic. 'Legacies: Contemporary Artists Reflect on Slavery']. And, this was part of larger initiative by the historical society to create three distinctly linked exhibitions that talked about New York's role in slavery.  In this project was precipitated by the discovery of the bodies at the African Burial Ground at the lower end of Manhattan [New York].  And, at the time those bodies were discovered, in order to validate what that sight was about, they had to go to the New-York Historical Society because that was the only place where they could find the original land maps of New York.  And, as they went back through the original maps, there on the maps was located the Negroes' burial ground.  When they did the cross sections and the studies of this sight, they realized that this area, this seven acre area, no, it wasn't seven acres, it wasn't even that large.  There're seven office buildings on that acreage which is about probably three acres, all right.   When they began to do the analysis they realized that that burial ground, which was the only place that African Americans could be buried.  Because if you didn't belong to a church you couldn't be buried in the church's cemetery.  So, the city designated a plot for Negroes.  Slavery was very much in play.  It was urban slavery.  And, they believed that this burial plot had in the neighborhood of over twenty thousand people interred in at least four to five levels over probably a hundred years.  So, it prompted the New-York Historical Society, ten years later, to begin to ask the questions, what was New York's real relationship with slavery?  And, as it turned out, the statistics indicate that every fourth person was a slave in New York.
Story_ID: 435006
Speaker 1: This was shocking to a lot of people.  I just saw the exhibit ['Commemorating New York's African Burial Ground: A National Monument'] last week in Harlem [New York, New York] at the Schomburg [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture].  I mean, I read about it before I saw the exhibit, I walked through.  I didn't get to the burial ground site but those statistics are shocking.  People say, "New York [New York], that's the, that's the Big Apple, it's not a slave--."
Speaker 2: That's right.  That's right.  It was devastating.
Speaker 1: But, back in the day, the slavery, prior to 1830--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --was it '7 [1837] or something?
Speaker 2: Yep.  They--probably almost around 1810, I mean, 1710.  It started back in the 1700s, all right.  First they eradicated the Native Americans, all the indigenous populations were literally outlawed from being on the island of Manhattan [New York].  Then, they started bring in the Africans.  And, when the burial ground was discovered because I was on one of the first juries, one of the first calls for ideas, it was so staggering, the impact on the city.  That the people in the office buildings would stand and look down at the excavation that was going on because people was in such shock that so many people were buried underneath those office buildings.  The questions for New Yorkers was, you knew the fair--the burial ground was there.  How could you place an office building on top of all of these human beings?  And, so, it was like a watch, a wake.  People on their breaks would go to the windows of these office buildings and they would look down.  Or, on their breaks they would come down and they would ring around the fences watching to look to see what happen.  They basically, finally excavated at least four hundred remains which were then sent to Howard University [Washington, D.C.] to be studied.  And, Howard University became the lead in researching the biology and chemistry of what happened to human beings down there.
Speaker 1: That was Dr. Blakely, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Michael Blakely [sic. HistoryMaker Michael Blakey] was the one who was the lead researcher on that.  But, the New-York Historical Society [New York, New York] was still deeply challenged because the New-York Historical Society is an institution whose job it was to safeguard the legacies of the patrons and the patriarchs of New York.  Now, not just New York State, but New York City.  And, so the questions again became, "Well, what were the role of these patients--patrons?  What were they doing?  All of these patriarchal figures, I mean, what did New York look like?  How was it functioning in these years?"  So, the first one, the first exhibition they did was, 'Slavery in New York' ['Slavery and the Making of New York'].  It was a landmark exhibition that broke all the records.  The second exhibition was this 'Legacy' shows, which said, 'Contemporary Artist Respond to Slavery,' [sic. 'Legacies: Contemporary Artists Reflect on Slavery'] and it was the first time the historical society ever had living artist exhibit in their space.  Jose [HistoryMaker Jose J. Mapily] and I became fascinated with the story of Seneca Village [New York, New York].  And, Jose is an architect and a city planner.  And, we had already been traveling around the country and abroad looking at praise houses, which are small scared houses that were used as either slave huts or their own personal sanctuaries and churches.  And, they were built in a very prescribed manner, usually ten by twelve feet, no larger.  And, they may have had one door, or one or two or three windows.  But, these were definitely spaces that slaves created.  So, we had begun to create a series of praise houses.  And, we were working on a praise house when Lowery Sims [Lowery Stokes Sims] came to us, who was invited to be one of the co-curators.  And she said, "I'm working on this show and I want you all to do a piece."  I said, "Fine."
Story_ID: 435007
Speaker 1: So, every weekend I would get to Jose's [HistoryMaker Jose J. Mapily] house and I would be talking about this village.  And, one day I was really impassioned about talking about this village because Lowery [Lowery Stokes Sims] had reminded me.  She said, "Leslie [HistoryMaker Leslie King-Hammond] don't forget that village was there."  And, I said, "Oh, my God."  So, I went online and I started Googling and researching and started finding all this information.  And, came back and said, "Jose, we got--I got this, this village, this village, and all these people."  And, I'm talking, and I'm giving him all the stats and, you know, and I fe- I feel an essay coming on, all right.  I know an essay is coming on.  But, I also know we have to do this praise house.  So, he's sitting there and listening to me, and listening to me, and he says, "Wait a minute."  He's says, "I have idea."  And, he's always doing this, and he'll pull a napkin or a paper towel.  And, he takes out his pen and he draws this huge thing and on top of it is the praise house.  And, I said, "What's that big thing on the bottom?"  He said, "It's the village."  And, I said, "And, whose gonna do the village?"  And, he says, "You're in charge of the village.  I'm in charge of the site."  And, what we did was, he took the original map of Seneca Village [New York, New York] that the only known architect at the time had created, put it on the computer and located the sites on it so that they were parallel with contemporary systems of how to identify high ground from low ground, building structures from wooded areas.  And, when he finished redrawing the map, I looked at the map and I went, "Wow.  That could be a beautiful conceptual design."  Which I took and transferred to a huge piece of linen, four feet by three feet.  And, created these four or five blocks where the village existed or these four, five little--units of space.  And, I stitched in, in the sampler tradition of 18th century women, European women who would stitch their alphabets and their number in their little houses.  I created a huge sampler which re-visioned what the village look like using semi-precious stones, beads, pearls, shells, metal, African ashoke fabric.  I did this huge stitched collage and I took for each of the houses, I made sequin and glass beads for every house, every farm, every cemetery, school, so that people would see this huge village.  And, then around the edges I placed turtles, who were guardians.  And, I added huge cowry shells in the decorative traditions of how we would have ornamented the surfaces of a story we were telling instead of painting it, we would stitch it in Africa or in the Caribbean.  And, I did this so that I could incorporate all of the skills that I had learned from my family and my background and that I loved.

Speaker 1: Before it was over, Jose [HistoryMaker Jose J. Mapily] was sewing the piece with me.  Because we had so much work to do and I had two pieces that I was doing.  I was doing the praise house piece as well as the village.  And, the village was too big for me to carry around.  So, when I went to work, 'cause Jose is retired, when I went to work on Monday morning, I would take the little one with me.  And, I would work on that in my senior staff meetings sitting next to the president.  And, then Jose would work on the big one.  I would tell him which sections we would be working on.  And, then when I got there on the weekend, we would both stitch it.  And, part of that was because his grandmother was a seamstress and used to make fabulous quilts and his mother [Gladys Mines Mapily] was seamstress.  And, as an architect and an artist, sewing is just part of how you make things happen.  It's just another tool.  And, so, when we were finished, the piece was so amazing it scared us.  And, it scared us; one, because we hadn't killed each other; and two, which was amazing for the intensity of the piece ['Celestial Praise House for Seneca Village,' Jose J. Mapily and Leslie King-Hammond].  And, two, the piece was so labor intensive, I'm sure that there are easily more than a million beads and sequins, and semi-precious stones in the piece.  And, it's, and it's so different.  It's just, that kind of recreation of how our people, our ancestors lived, okay, had not been ever done.  So, this is where our work is going now, and we're continuing to do more investigation and working on more series of houses like this because people are mesmerized by them.  Children love them.  Adults love them.  And, it brings back to everybody's sensibility that even during the period of slavery we had communities of African Americans who were struggling to live normal lives.  Ordinary lives in spite of horrendous conditions.  And, in spite of the politics of those eras which were designed to keep them from realizing their human capacity and potential.  So, that's where Jose and I, that's where our work is going.  We, we're now just impassioned with finding sites and interpreting them.
Story_ID: 435009
Speaker 1: Does this story, the story of Seneca Village [New York, New York], now did you write about it eventually as a, did you write about it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I haven't written about it yet, formally.  I have a lot of note and we, we did a lot of writing for the presentation and there were placards that explained everything.  But, I haven't sat down to do the full story because I need to go up to Harvard University [Cambridge, Massachusetts] where Olmsted's [Frederick Law Olmsted] papers are to--I'm not finished with my research.  The way I do research, I like to really flush it out and there are a number of questions that I need to at least track down to figure out if in fact these questions will yield me information.  If in fact, I can track down any descendants because to date we weren't able to find any descendants, even though we have images and drawings of people who lived during that period in that village and, or owned property in that village.  So, which is highly fascinating.  It's most unusual.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the names, I know, I thought of the African American actor, Joe Seneca immediately when I thought of it.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: I don't know where he's from but, it's interesting.
Speaker 2: Well, we're also not sure too where the name Seneca comes from.  There are at least three of--
Speaker 1: Seneca was a, is a, is an American Indian [Native American] group.
Speaker 2: Yes.  That's part of a nation.
Speaker 1: But, yeah.
Speaker 2: But, there was also a philosopher who wrote a treaties.  And, it was on the morals of the times.  So, we don't know if the people in that period who were, of course, reading and writing, were not versed in this particular document.  So, there are a number of things.  And, then I have to go and I have to look at, and that's why I need Jose [HistoryMaker Jose J. Mapily], to go and look at Olmsted's original drawings.  Because Jose and I need to go and do some interpretation about this site in Central Park [New York, New York].  Because we still believe, even the curator at the historical society [New-York Historical Society, New York, New York] who created this show with Lowery Sims [Lowery Stokes Sims], Cynthia Copeland and Kathleen Hulser, we believe that the village is still there just underneath the ground.  But, nobody wants to dig up Central Park to find out the truth.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It may be in Frederick Law Olmsted's papers.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  And, that's, and that's where we are with our artwork.
Story_ID: 435010
Speaker 1: The 'Agents of Change: Women, Art and Intellect.'  That's the latest piece you curated.  So, tell us a little bit about that.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's a show that I was asked to curate by Lowery [Lowery Stokes Sims]; not Lowery, excuse me.  There was a show I was asked to curate by Arlene Raven.  And, Arlene Raven, and Lowery, and I were in grad school at Hopkins [Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland] together.  Arlene went on to become a major feminist voice founding the feminist art movement out in Los Angeles [California].  And, 2007, 2008 marks the thirty year anniversary of this movement.  So, she asked me to curate a show about women artists at the break of this three year decade anniversary and celebration.  So, I have had my issues with feminism because when feminism began, the white women got up, burned their bras, rushed right off into history without us women of color.  And, feminism has always been equated with white women seeking their parity, their voice in the mainstream for too long.  When in fact the things that affect white women also affect black women, Latino women, Native American woman, Asian women, they just affect women across the board.  So, I created a show that would commemorate the voice of women called 'Agents of Change.'  Because women were not at that pinnacle of their career where they were making impact with their images and their voice.  And, I called the show, 'Women, Art and Intellect.'  And, I had a show which gave honor to the, some of the founding members of the feminist movement.  As well as some of the voices that came in the second wave.  And, certainly the new emerging voices.  And, as God would have it, I was blessed with a fabulous review from Holland Cotter who's one of the chief critics at The New York Times, who understood what I was trying to do and what I was trying to say.  And, it was about the fact that feminism does not have one voice or one face.  And, that it is a mutigenerational experience.  And, that there are all kinds of females who have all kinds of issues that need to be put in the forefront of the discourse.  So, the exhibition was, I think, wonderfully received.  And, it was also a very sad moment because during the summer, last summer, Arlene Raven passed.  And, she and I were the same age, with the same birth year, and we really didn't know that she was that sick.  And, so, I'm still dealing with the fact that, how do I resolve that she's transitioned to the next level when I, I feel like I'm still having this conversation with her.

Speaker 1: I have here also that your house is one gigantic, altaric--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --vortex.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's Lowery Sims [Lowery Stokes Sims] (laughter).
Speaker 1: --what is (laughter), what is a gigantic altaric vortex?  And--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, (laughter), you know, most artist have studios where they make stuff.  Well, I was a single parent with a house.  And, so, the top floor of my house is where I either write one half or make stuff in the other half.  And, the rest of the house is sites where I create installation and spaces.  Lowery made that statement when she came, comes down to visit me and she's always looking at the assemblages and the combinations of work.  And, when [HistoryMaker] Deborah Willis came to my house to choose the work for the exhibition, she in fact, chose one of these altars that I had created in the house.  Since I live in a 19th century townhouse which was built in 18--, either 1886, or 1896.  And, it came with a series of fireplaces.  And, when I renovated the house with my husband at that time, we did not activate the fireplaces.  So, I turned them into altars.  So, all the altars in the different rooms are draped or designated to hold certain items and special objects of sacred energy.  So, I have in my house, I think I have seven alt- seven mantels; seven, yeah I think, at least six or seven mantels.  And, the only one haven't draped is the one in the kitchen 'cause I have the kitchen stove in that one.  'Cause the house was so old that originally they cooked in an old fireplace.  I live with my art.  I don't, you know--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Seven, seven mantels--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  All hand carved from France.  Gorgeous.  That's one thing about Baltimore [Maryland], Baltimore has gorgeous architecture.  Just fabulous architecture.
Story_ID: 435012
Speaker 1: We always ask this question.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: My continued hope and concern is that they constantly find ways to empower themselves and reclaim their spaces so that they can take control of their culture institutions and their academic institution and their political institutions.  That they constantly see themselves as viable members of this nation and they continue to work to establish the order and the civility that is necessary to lead the young people to a life of leadership.  Because if we don't start planning for the new leaders, where are they gonna come from?  We don't have no leaders, we can't protect our institutions.  We can't protect ourselves.  We cannot move forward in a way which gives credence to a reality that supports the kind of life that we want to live.  So, I'm always very fascinated and very committed to helping any organizational community to realize that.  That they have a gift to give.  They have a contribution to be made.  That they are not isolated, just members in a committee.  And, excuse me, excuse me, not members in a community, not participating fully in the business of being a society.  'Cause if you don't have a society, you don't have families, you understand.  You don't, you don't have neighborhoods, okay.  You have despaired people living beyond doors, seeking sanctuary and safety and you, you don't have the energies that foster a life that is worth living.

Speaker 1: Now, when you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could do it again?
Speaker 2: Sleep more.  (Laughter) Sleep more.  Take better care of my body (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I get so absorbed in being a single parent, you know, you become inadvertently, not willfully, inadvertently a workaholic because you're the sole support for dependences and well-being for your family.  So, you know, I work too much.  My resume makes me tired, you know.  Now, I'm a chair of a board of a museum [Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African American History and Culture, Baltimore, Maryland] and I'm going, "What is wrong with you?"  You know.  Like you didn't have anything to do or you were taking a nap at a meeting, or when you're absent from a meeting, they go, "Oh, she'll do it," (laughter).
Story_ID: 435014
Speaker 1: In that vein, I mean, what today when you look back at all these things that you're doing and probably will do, what today do you think is your legacy?
Speaker 2: Took a risk. Took a chance.  Tried something new.  Did not give into the status quo, not satisfied with the ordinary.  I figure people only use 5, 10 percent of their brains.  What happened to the other 90 percent?  Can't we do things a little bit differently?  Better?  Doesn't have to be brilliant but it could be better.  We could be in a better world.  We could be in a better place.  So, that's what I think about.
Story_ID: 435015
Speaker 1: Tell us something about your, a little bit more about your family.  You talked about it at one point, but you have two sons, right?
Speaker 2: I have two sons.  Very interesting young men because they're part of a new generation.  I have two sons.  I have my birth son, I call him my DNA, okay.  He's my magic.  And, he is become a videographer, all right.  And, he has his own multimedia production company, Green Eye Multimedia [Green Eye Multimedia Productions, Baltimore, Maryland].  And, his name is Rassaan Hammond, R-A-S-S-A-A-N, Hammond, H-A-M-M-O-N-D.  We named him after Rahsaan Roland Kirk, the jazz musician.  And, he has partnered himself with childhood buddies who have skills in computer and photography and sound production.  And, they make documentaries and music videos and produce fashion shows and reggae and jazz shows in the city.  And, they have a five thousand square foot loft in the new arts entertainment district [Station North Arts and Entertainment District] in Baltimore [Maryland].  And, their commitment is to stay in a city that need young people to rebuild the city.  And, so, my son Rassaan spends a lot of time talking with his friends who have relocated to other cities, convincing them to come back and work to build Baltimore.  My second son, who I call my miracle.  That's my magic and my miracle, is Terrence Hinton.  And, he came to me as a result of a relationship that I had with his father at the time.  And, when that relationship broke up, Terrence stayed in my life.  He was eighteen months older than Rassaan.  And, the two of them had already become brothers.  They met when they were three and five.  And, I don't believe that children should have to pay for any mistakes that their parents make.  And, that whether the unions last or not, it's about the wellbeing of the child.  And, the two of them stayed close all these years and are still close.  Terrence has just finished his master's [degree] in human services and community psychology, and he was the commencement speaker for his graduation.  And, right now he is working for Baltimore City Head Start, working with three year olds and four year olds who are physically challenged trying to develop programs and initiatives to support them while he's getting ready to work on his doctorate in human psychology and community service.  So, somewhere along the line they grew up and I missed it, you know.  It happens.
Story_ID: 435016
Speaker 1: I think it happened at one point because I got real sick at one point.  And, they [King-Hammond's sons, Rassaan Hammond and Terrence Hinton] were like, I guess, they were like twenty-one and twenty-three and I was grounded because I had major surgery.  And, so, I couldn't do anything.  I couldn't pay bills.  I couldn't go to the supermarket, and they took over.  And, I think somewhere in there this--it flipped and they became, you know, the caretakers.  They, they took on that level of maturity, and just focused themselves.  So, they, they work very closely together.  They're not married.  It's probably gonna take them awhile to be married because they're very much committed to their jobs and their community [Baltimore, Maryland].  And, they see too much work to be done as young men before they settle down to commit to a family because they have vivid memories of being with me.  And, I took them on the road with me.  They traveled with me.  They do research with me.  We do research the first half of the trip of the day and then the rest of the day we would do whatever they wanted to do.  We do the culture and the research first and then I say, "Okay, guys wanna you wanna do?"  So, I got to see Hulk Hogan live.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: I got to go (laughter)--big stock car races and go carts.  But, they were boys, and that's what you did.  But, I wasn't gonna leave them, and I also felt that traveling was good for them, you know.  And, they came to Chicago [Illinois], we got in a cab because we were looking for video parlors or places to play, well, they were video crazy but we couldn't find any.  So, we just took a tour of, of Chicago.  And, they were really upset because it was a big bill for the cab.  And, I went, "So, what's the difference?  We had a great time."  The cab driver showed us the lake, showed us all the parts of Chicago.  So, they will take trips and they'll go places.  But, they come right back.  They're like homing pigeons.  They come right back to their work.  And, I have to work on 'em because they to work too much for young men.  They work too much, you know, and they picked up a bad habit from me.
Story_ID: 435017
Speaker 1: Is there anything else we need to discuss right now before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No.  You done peeled back my whole life, just--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Whatever (laughter).
Speaker 1: And, you left us with a wealth of information for the archive box so we, it's a lot of material there.
Speaker 2: And, I'm gonna send you a disk with all kinds of images labeled so you can just slip 'em in.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, with dates, labels, names, and dates so you can, whatever.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, the last question is similar to legacy in some respects but a little different.  Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Hard working, fun, funny, and unpredictable.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, thank you.
Speaker 2: Thank you.  That was good.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
