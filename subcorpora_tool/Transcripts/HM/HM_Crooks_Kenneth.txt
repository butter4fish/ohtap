Story_ID: 48653
Speaker 1: Okay we would like to begin by asking about your family, your mother and father.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Tell us about them.
Speaker 2: My mother, Nella Octava (ph.) Edgar, she was born in Jamaica.  As a young lady, grew up in Saint Ann in Jamaica.  She was the proud daughter of her mother [Martha Jane Barnett Henry] and she was the special child of her mother.  She was the one that rode the buggy and had the horse driven buggy to take her to school, had her lunch delivered to her while she was in school as a youngster.  So she had what they called privilege in Jamaica.  While she was a young lady, she worked with the--with the pharmacist and got her pharmacy degree that way and met a lot of her female friends through the pharmacy and she worked at the post office for a while, I believe.  She was committed to marrying a Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] man.  And she came to America to work for, like they say, the white people, a maid in white homes.  She ran into her Harvard man there and married my father [Kenneth Crooks] back in the '20's [1920's] and had four children.  My father was also born in Jamaica, in Hanover, and he went to school in Jamaica, went to Jamaica college, did very well in school, had good grades, had the opportunity to go to Harvard or to University of London or Edinburg and he chose Harvard.  Did a fairly good job at Harvard, went through four years of undergraduate school where he played soccer and had a reasonably good and exciting life, as I understand it.  And went on and got his master degree and then his doctorate.  As an undergraduate student he played soccer and I believe he was asked to be the soccer--a member of the soccer team from the USA for the '36 [1936] Olympics, but he was denied that opportunity because they--he was classified as a Jamaican at the time, not American.  We still have uncomfortable feelings about that as we hear the story told as a young man telling the story, but those are things that are now under the bridge.  Grew up, graduated from school and looked, and looked for a job.  Got a job at Hampton Institute in Hampton, Virginia and begin teaching as an instructor in biology, that's when the kids begin to come along.  And he and my mother got an opportunity in 1941 to go back to Jamaica, their hometown, under the auspices of the Religious Society of Friends, the Quakers, Richmond, Indiana five years meeting.  So he went to Jamaica as the Headmaster of Happy Grove [High] and as the Pastor of Seaside Friends Church.  Happy Grove is a little small country school out in the woods, about 80 miles west of Kingston, a little town called Hector's River, right on the ocean.  So we spent half our lives in our bathing suits and joined Mother Nature climbing coconut trees, picking bananas and having stuff of that sort.  That's my father and my mother's image as a youngster.
Story_ID: 48654
Speaker 1: Now your parents--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --my parents--
Speaker 1: Your grandparents, did you have any--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Didn't know much about my grandparents.  My father's mother [Jeanetta Crooks] I knew because she came to live for us for a brief while in Jamaica.  And my mother's father [Alex Edgar] I knew only once when I had to drive her from our home at Happy Grove all the way to Saint Ann because he--that's where he died and she had to be a part of that whole experience.  That's where I ran into the rest of the family and was a part of that experience very briefly.
Story_ID: 48655
Speaker 1: Your siblings, could you name them in order, name them.
Speaker 2: Cynthia May Crooks Carpenter is my oldest sister.  She was a counselor, an educator most of her life, lived in Chicago, went to George School.  First black female, I believe, from Jamaica to go to George School [Newtown, Pennsylvania] in those days, that's must be in '52 [1952] I guess, '51 [1951] or '52 and then from George School she went on to Earlham College [Richmond, Indiana].  Went to Chicago, got married and have two of her own children and now she's retired in San Diego, California.  My next sister, one below me, is Sylvia Crooks, Sylvia Amelia Crooks Wunderlich.  She went to Germany as an Air Force nurse, married an architect in Germany, had a couple of kids and she is now also retired, but she's still living in Germany.  My oldest--my youngest sister is Nella Crooks Jenkins.  She came to the University of Massachusetts [Amherst] for the me back in the '50's [1950's] and went back to Chicago--went to Chicago from there, got involved in medical technology, ended up working in a hospital, married Jenkins and then went to Fort Valley [State University, Fort Valley, Georgia].  She's now in Fort Valley taking care of my 100 year old mother.  She's also retired.
Story_ID: 48656
Speaker 1: Now the first half of your growing up took place in Hampton, Virginia in that community at the [Hampton] Institute [now Hampton University].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell us about your childhood in that society and growing up there and your mother and father's interaction and the children there in the community.
Speaker 2: My earliest memory of, of Happy--of, of Hampton must have been during the 1936 flood when the water came under the front door of our house.  And we saw someone rowing by in a row boat and there was panic in the neighborhood and people were concerned about what was going on.  I guess I was five and that's one of the experiences that I can remember.  It just comes in and goes out.  I can remember Mr. Gammick (ph.) driving a horse drawn vegetable cart with steel wheels.  It would go clickety-click click down the street.  We could remember him coming and he would be selling vegetables, potatoes from the Hampton Institute farm.  I can remember sneaking off to Ogden Hall one evening with my three sisters to hear a great organist who was coming to play at Hampton Institute.  We snuck in--we snuck out when our parents left, sat in the window of the building, listen to this great performance.  And just before they were closing it, we rushed back home and we jumped in bed with our clothes on and pulled the covers up and pretended to be asleep.  And our parents came in and they said, "oh the children are sleeping".  And they put their hands near our nostrils and of course they, they could see our breathing heavily because we ran back and next day we suffered a little bit for that, but we learned not to go out without (laughter) letting them know.  Those were the kind of experiences we had at Hampton, but Hampton was an isolated community.  They were all professors.  It was an all-black community and it was a nice environment to be in.
Story_ID: 48657
Speaker 1: Your parents' personalities, describe your mother's personalities and her attempts in rearing you and your father's personality and how that affected your rearing.
Speaker 2: Mother [Nella Crooks] was a truly at home--stay at home, take care of the kids mother.  Mom, she make sure--made sure that we got our homework, our lessons, took care of us and ushered us back and forth.  And as we grew up where those times came that she wasn't quite prepared to discipline us, she used the typical phrase, "wait till your father [Kenneth B.M. Crooks] gets home" (laughter).  And he made up for bad times.  As a youngest at the--in Jamaica, of course we were a little older then, she had the habit of closing the windows in our house and when the windows begin to close in the daytime, the neighbors knew that the kids were in for a beating.  We finally told her that story and she didn't close them quite as loudly as she did before, but those were kind of exciting times.  Yes, we did get the belt every now and again.  My father was a serious research scientist.  He had books from the ceiling to the floor and from the door all the way to the back, to the back cupboard.  He had everything that was in biology.  I mean he had big, thick books that we could hardly get off the shelf to look at the naked people in them (laughter) to the stories of, of the diseases and the germs and that someone--as little kids we just poured over this material and had a good time doing that, but he was also very stern man when it came to disciplining the kids.  He made sure that we got our work--we got our stuff done.
Story_ID: 48658
Speaker 1: Now you said Hampton [the Hampton Institute, Hampton, Virginia] was pretty much a confined institution, a confined community growing up.  Did you ever experience the effects of Jim Crow that were occurring in the South with your parents or with your mother or father when you left the campus?
Speaker 2: I don't think we recognized the experience.  I don't think we computed the experience until we left and grew up.  I can remember my mother [Nella Crooks] and daddy [Kenneth B.M. Crooks] saying we had to put on our nice new clothes because we were going to go to Hampton to see Mr. Von Shuling (ph.) who was the bank president in Hampton, and we'd dress up and doll up and we were instructed to sit very still.  We'd drive over to Hampton and we'd go into the bank and that's the first time we saw a lot of white people and we'd sit at the--in a certain location and then we'd go into the office and my father would sit and talk.  We didn't understand what was going on at the time.  Later on we'd learned that he was negotiating for a loan for some reason and Mr. Von Shuling was the bank president who arranged for the loans for the faculty at Hampton.
Story_ID: 48659
Speaker 1: Your schooling--your elementary school at Hampton [Virginia], what school did you go to?
Speaker 2: Went to Phoebus [Phoebus Elementary School] to school and I guess it was Phenix City--Phenix High School I think.  I think that's the correct name of that.  Didn't do very well in school grade-wise, enjoyed it though, had a good time.  Went to Ham--to Jamaica as a youngest and completed my education at the secondary level at Happy Grove [High School, Portland, Jamaica] where my father was headmaster.  It's a challenge to be the son of the headmaster of a school.  It's like being a preacher's child also 'cause he was also the, the preacher of the church.  You never got into any of the inside crowd, you never really knew what was going on.  Kids would not tell you what the story was.  You didn't get all of the tricks of the trade so you kinda were isolated in that, in that setting that gave you a certain kind of an elitist status that did not permitted you to be a part of a real tight group.  So some of things that most of the kids learned and the feelings that they had and stuff of this sort, you know, I didn't get involved in a lot of that because the presumption was it would get back to the headmaster and so I was left out.
Story_ID: 48660
Speaker 1: So now at the age of ten, your family moves to Jamaica.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Did you wanna make this move and what was this move like after you made it?
Speaker 2: Oh it was great.  I mean, we're going to Jamaica was a great big thing.  My oldest sister did a little bit more research than I did, but the whole idea of going to Jamaica, which was home for them.  And we'd been hearing things about Jamaica, we'd been hearing a little bit about the grandparents in Jamaica, we gonna go back to Jamaica some time.  And then we learn to sing the song, "I'm going home, I won't be alone, I'm going home, surely be strong, I'm going home to Jamaica".  We finally went to New York and I think Darthemia (ph.) drove up in her automobile--her chauffeur driven automobile to wish us all a fond farewell.  We didn't know who Darthemia was at that time; later on we learned that she was a great singer, and we got on the boat, the S.S. Atlantida.  And I had a white sailor suit with a square back with a blue line that had two stars on the back of the--on the back of the shirt and my sisters were all dolled up.  We made the trip to Jamaica.  Twice during the voyage we had blackouts because, of course, it was in the middle of the war [World War II] and we learned later that the boat was sunk on the way back to--back to U.S.A.  So we kinda feel blessed that we got there safe and sound.  Got to Jamaica and found no electricity, no running water, a truly rural setting, and my father under the auspices of the Quakers was committed to making Happy Grove [High School, Portland, Jamaica], as he said, "the best secondary school on the island", and making the Seaside Friends Church a real meaningful institution in the community where people would be able to develop the spiritual relationships that he was concerned about.  In a short period of time, he did make Happy Grove a real school to be challenged in the community.  And on my--on the island, before he left Happy Grove was one top five schools.  We--he generated the Mayor of the City, the Chief of Police, all the island leadership, big lawyers and so on, came through Happy Grove under my father's leadership and did a good job at bringing that to be.  But here I was hanging onto the sides (laughter) with my finger nails being a part of that whole machine, you know.
Story_ID: 48661
Speaker 1: How did that affect your dad [Kenneth B.M. Crooks] that his son of the school not doing as well--not doing very well and he's the headmaster?  Did he ever bring that up to you or--
Speaker 2: Well, the lines on my bottom are reflective of his concerns (laughter).  I guess I didn't take the experience of learning as serious as I should have.  After all I was the headmaster son.  I mean, I had lots of things at my disposal and I guess that may have affected my attitude about education.  I guess the real challenge began to surface when he told me it's time for to select a college to go to and I had the choice of going to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] or University of Massachusetts Amherst[Amherst, Massachusetts] or some other school.  I realized that if I went to Harvard, where my father went and made straight 'A's until he was a PhD and they flunked him one course because they didn't want him to go through with straight 'A's, I would have a really serious educational challenge. So I opted for the University of Massachusetts and did fairly well.
Story_ID: 48662
Speaker 1: So what's it like to graduate--graduate college--I mean you graduated high school and you're coming back to the States.  Did you want to leave the states?
Speaker 2: When I, when I got the message that I was accepted to the University of Massachusetts Amherst[Amherst, Massachusetts], my mental and physical heart began to, to increase in some pulsations there.  When I--when we came to America, the whole family came, my father [Kenneth B.M. Crooks] came for his 25th reunion at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and we learned about University of Massachusetts.  We learned about the town of Cambridge where Harvard is located in about five days where this reunion was going on.  And my father finally said, "son you have to work this summer to get to school in September", and this was in June--in May.  I really didn't know what work was, you can image the son of a headmaster.  I got a job with a friend of my father's to help build a school in New Hampshire and guess who wheeled the bricks up the ramp for two and a half stories? I did.  And I stayed in Keene, New Hampshire in 1952 at the YMCA.  Only black kid in the "Y" and learned about America with blood, sweat and tears (laughter), in Keene, New Hampshire.  And I finally got to Amherst in September and was assigned to the field dormitory, finally found a nice warm bed.
Story_ID: 48663
Speaker 1: Now that you're, at some point, grown up at this point and you've moved on, what--the sights, sounds and smells that remind you of your childhood, what are they?
Speaker 2: Sights, sounds and smells?
Speaker 1: That bring you back to Jamaica or Hampton [Virginia].
Speaker 2: There are not many sights or sounds that remind me of Jamaica except for one of two visitations that I make in Columbus [Georgia] where there are a couple of Jamaicans, a couple of West Indians who have restaurants and other things.  And I fall into my Jamaican accent right fast with the boys (laughter) on the corner and that's one of the places.  When I go to Atlanta [Georgia] where I spent a lot of my life, I also run into West Indians and others who remind me of Jamaica; very few memories of Hampton.
Story_ID: 48664
Speaker 1: So now you're at Amherst [University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, Massachusetts], starting your freshman year, how much of a difference now that you've come from Jamaica, which is an all black nation, and now you're back into the United States which has some situations with racism.
Speaker 2: Well they--the Amherst experience was very interesting.  I came to Jamaica from--I came to Amherst from Jamaica, even though I was a Massachusetts resident and later on I learned that as a resident of Mass [Massachusetts] I was going to the state's school which was reasonably economic at that time, but I came from Jamaica to the Amherst campus and so I was classified as a foreign student.  In my foreign student experiences for the first three weeks were absolutely wonderful.  We got invited to the Mayor's office, we went downtown, we were wined and dined as foreigners in the land that I had an accent at that time.  And in one of those Saturday morning seminars session where we were all telling about our country, I just happen to mention at the beginning of my presentation that I was born in Boston [Massachusetts] and went to Jamaica with missionary educated parents and then came back to Amherst to go to school.  And a little lady in the front row, stood up and said, "oh you're just an American Negro that went overseas".  And I didn't understand what she was saying until the third day when everyone was getting ready to go to another affair and my name wasn't on the list.  And then my eyes were open and new knowledge and new experiences called for new behavior.  And I learned then about segregation and the America I found myself in and I decided very quickly to get rid of my accent and find some American clothes, 'cause I had Jamaican clothes on, and become a part of black America, whatever that was, I was looking for.  The other part that's exciting is that coming from a country where the coldest, coldest night was 68 [degrees] and the warmth--nice warmth was 70, 80 and maybe would hit 90 now and again, gave the body a certain kind of behavior, style that was kind of comfortable.  When I got to Amherst and November rolled around and the first snow came, I went to the army-navy store.  I bought two pairs of army-navy socks and pair of army-navy boots and some army-navy underwear and still froze.  That's probably the other very, very important (laughter) part of my life that I learned dealing with cold weather.
Story_ID: 48665
Speaker 1: Doing your matriculation, how did you choose your major?  What major were you--
Speaker 2: When I was--when I was Ham--when was in Happy Grove [Jamaica], there was an old clock at Seaside Friends Church that wouldn't--wasn't working for a long time.  And one weekend I climbed up the tower unbeknownsting to anybody, found the clock mechanism, recognized that everything was in fairly good condition despite the cold--despite the warm salt air from the, from the ocean.  And I tinkered with it a while and found out that there were a couple of spots that needed to be scratched off and a couple of weights that needed to be changed and I could get the clock working.  So one afternoon, out of clear blue sky, the clock began tolling the numbers and people came from all around town to see how the clock was working, some miracle had been performed, you know.  I climbed out of the clock tower and said the clock's not working.  Since that time my mother [Nella Crooks] decided that I would be an engineer, I'll be an architectural designer, I was going to build bridges (laughter) and so on.  So I went to the University [University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, Massachusetts] with expectation of becoming a mechanical engineer.  Very quickly the physics (laughter) and the calculus had me change to my major, which was business administration.  And I graduated one semester late, but I got through and got a Bachelor of Business Administration from Amherst.
Speaker 1: Are there any other experiences during that college time that you feel really might have molded you later on in life to--
Speaker 2: Yes.  I ran into a good friend of mine, Ed Cooper, whose father was an Ambassador from Liberia and he came at the same time that I did and, of course, he drove the newest Cadillac and top down and so on.  And he and I just happen to be in the same dormitory and got hooked up.  So I was tagging along with the legitimate foreign student (laughter).  So I'd ride in the back seat and he would ride in the front and we interesting experiences, dating and going to Boston [Massachusetts] and going to New York and doing things.  I learned a little bit about the--another level of involvement of countries when Ed did not get tickets when he was speeding and so on.  Those kinds of things gave me new a vision about the great America that we live in.
Story_ID: 48666
Speaker 1: So what was up next for you after graduation?  You just have your degree and what-- (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Well I got my--I got my, my certificate and material from the Dean's office one afternoon in February of '57 [1957] and the next morning--I joined a fraternity by the way, Tau Kappa Epsilon, and the--and I was the second black TKE in America, as I understand it.  Frank Spriggs was in the year before that I was.  And I--these guys came to my room and they said, "are you Kenneth Crooks"?  And I said yes.  And he said, "we need to see you".  So the other guys left their room, there were four guys in a room and they gave me a telegram.  And I open the telegram and it said from President Dwight D. Eisenhower, welcome you are reported--you are to report to some station in New Ham--in North Hampton, Massachusetts in four days.  I was being drafted.  I had to sell my automobile, pack my stuff up and get ready to go.  I mean when Dwight Eisenhower says go, you go and so I was inducted into the military service.  My father was a Quaker Minister and I had the Quaker orientation, so I when in as a non-com--non-combatant.  And--so they shipped me off to Fort Devens--they shipped me off to Fort Dix, New Jersey for my assessment and evaluation and then they sent me to some place in Texas for my basic training in med--in medical medicine.  So I got that, that elemen--elementary stuff there.
Speaker 1: So what was it like in Texas?
Speaker 2: Enjoyed it, had a good time, learned about the [U.S] Army and sorry that the draft is not operative in this day and time.  I think America could use the draft.  Young men need to learn to make their beds up in the morning, get up and put their clothes together and have them all lined up and organized (laughter), and their--good physical exercise that the military trained me to do was, was exciting.  The medic--the medic in the military is a, is a good job, a good job.  I got out and came back to Boston.  Just prior to me getting out I learned that my father [Kenneth B.M. Crooks] was sick and I tried to--and he was in Louisiana at that time, and I was getting hops all across the country tried to get to Japan to go out there to buy a camera and some high tech equipment back in '57 [1957] those are (laughter), important days.  Came back to, to Boston to get out of the draft--out of the service.  My father died shortly thereafter.  But trying to get a job between '59 [1959] and '60 [1960] was not a very easy job to do.  I learned that my classmates had all got jobs in the management training programs.  I don't know what that was all about until I started asking crazy questions and somebody finally said, "black people don't start in management finishing programs" in this time, another eye-opener for me.
Story_ID: 64047
Speaker 1: So, so you graduate Amherst [University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, Massachusetts], you go to military [U.S. Army], come back and realize, I'm not getting a job because I can't get to those managing training job, so what did you do at this point?
Speaker 2: When ga--when I came back to Boston [Massachusetts], I--after I was discharged from the military, I was staying with my Uncle Billy who was working at the laboratories at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and I had find something to do because my little savings from the military was running out.  So I got a job in a Jewish old folks home on the 3 to 11, I'm sorry, the 11 to 7 shift.  I would go into work at 11 o'clock at night and do what needed to be done, 12, 1 o'clock, then get the newspapers and other materials that I had, do some research and by the time I got through with that, at 6 o'clock in the morning I go home, rest for a couple three hours and hit the streets again.  And I learned that all of my classmates had gotten jobs in the insurance business and that's big in New England, so I did the same thing.  I begin to go around to all the personnel officers and finally got to New Haven, Connecticut and some brave guy, white male, said to me you've been to, you know, twenty places and I knew you were coming.  You're on the wrong track.  We aren't ready to hire black folks in the middle management track right now in the, in the insurance industry.  And that's when I begin to feel a little bit uncomfortable.  And somewhere in that time, my father [Kenneth B.M. Crooks] died in Louisiana.  And so when I went back to Louisiana and discovered that my mother--the lady who took care of all our or kids, the lady who, who did the real thing for us, the lady who was our true mother, gave up her college education option--was just there with no husband.  I looked around and my sisters were busy doing their thing so I decided to stay in Grambling [Louisiana] and, quote, take care of mom, close quote.  I did that, got a job at the accounting office, took the test and performed very well on the test, the State test.  And so I got a job as an accountant assistant at Grambling State University [Grambling, Louisiana].  After a year was over, my mother immediately enrolled in school.  I got her going back into her own thing and she got her bachelor's degree pretty quickly, 'cause she was taking some courses at Fort Valley [Fort Valley State University, Fort Valley, Georgia] when my daddy was there before.  So she graduated from Grambling in about a year and a half with a master's degree, I guess.  And she was offered a job at Fort Valley and I begin looking at college--graduate school as an option.  And so Atlanta University [now Clark Atlanta University in Atlanta, Georgia] popped up, a job offer from Fort Valley to be the house mother in one of the dorms popped up as a counselor and so we moved back further east to the Louisiana and ended up on this side of the country.  And that's how I got back to Georgia and how I got back to Atlanta University.  That's when I started my master's program.
Story_ID: 64048
Speaker 1: And how was your experience at Atlanta [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Having had a very rough high school, having had a challenge at college, I got a commitment from myself and the powers that be, I will make straight 'A's in graduate school.  And when I got to Atlanta, here's the world turning upside down.  As Julian Bond [HM] said in one of the meetings, "ladies and gentlemen, we're making history, let's not worry about classes".  Well I heard it, but I didn't hear it and he was right.  But I spent half my time studying in the dormitory and the other half being the president of the Atlanta University [now Clark Atlanta University] student body representing the kids at the meetings with the Benny [Benjamin] Mays and Rufus Clement and the downtown police officers and JB Blayton (ph) and trying to keep the student movement operative.  Lonnie King, Otis Moss Smith, that group, Hershel Sullivan were in their second year and so they were really well-organized at that time.  I, I mean the basic underpinnings for SNCC and the movement had, had been established.  I just came in and filled in the roll as president of the student body.  So I had a chance to meet with Benny Mays and those others in negotiations for trying to get things done.
Speaker 1: Now is this a different type of racism you were experiencing when you come to Atlanta that you hadn't seen earlier in Massachusetts or maybe even in Louisiana?
Speaker 2: I think, I think Atlanta had a different kind of experience.  Atlanta had the benefit of Atlanta Life Insurance Company, Morehouse [Morehouse College], Clark [Clark College, now Clark Atlanta University], Spelman [Spelman College], Inter-Denominational Theological Center and a series of businesses that were thriving.  (unclear) Business School and there were Paschal's Motor Hotel, the Atlanta Daily World.  These were established institutions that came out of Sweet Auburn and so you got a different feel in Atlanta.  There was a respect for the black community and there was an admiration, I think, on the part of the white community for Atlanta.  And negotiations begin about how we resolve some of the issues with respect to, to desegregation, I think that the approach that was taken in Atlanta, despite the fact that we had students going to jail and students being kicked off the sidewalk and being man-handled sort of speak.  It was a less--it was a little more delicate than it was in Alabama and Mississippi and Tennessee.

Speaker 1: As the, as the president of the student body for Atlanta University [now Clark Atlanta University in Atlanta, Georgia], (unclear) the graduate school, I got involved with the youngsters from Clark [Clark College, now Clark Atlanta University], Marshbon (ph) Spelman [Spelman College] and Morehouse [Morehouse College].  These were young, aggressive, tuition-having-been-paid-by-parents-kids (laughter).  When I was a graduate student struggling, working on the weekends at the Jewish club out on, I'm not sure where the location is, but I had waiter's jobs on the weekends where I was waiting tables, trying to survive to make it in those tough times.  And so there was--although I felt strongly in support of what they were doing, I didn't have the wherewithal to--I had to watch out where the next meal was coming from (laughter).  No father and my mom [Adele Crooks] was working as a counselor and I was a grown person at that time, and didn't feel like I should burden her with that responsibility.  And so I was really caught between the devil and the deep blue sea in fulfilling my role as an African American, which I was, who I just happen to have spent some time in Jamaica and the Jamerican, which we like to call ourselves, we had a (unclear) little group trying to make it in the great country of opportunity.  The kids would take a rally club approach to some solutions and I would try with others to meld--mold that so that it didn't have to be as dramatic as they like to see it happen.  I think I spent a lot of time on the telephone in Reverend [Joseph Everhard] Boone's church payphone directing kids to where the police were not, 'cause the police couldn't be everywhere at the same time.  So we'd the find the location where there were no police cars; we'd send the kids from that location to the place where there were no policemen and they would try to sit-in.  And when the cops got over there, then we'd (unclear), and in fact they were not at Sears, then we send the kids back to Sears.  So for a couple days there we had an exciting play with the, with the police.  And they did arrest the kids and they took them to jail and we'd take them food baskets and take letters back and forth for their--to their parents and they'd write theirs in jail and we'd spend the time doing that.  I saw myself in the coordinating, functioning, assisting role and not being in jail with the kids.  Somebody had to do the other part of it and I think that's where the T.M. Alexanders [Theodore Martin Alexander, Sr.] and the wealthy black Atlantans tried to make sure that they had a vehicle for solving the problems.

Speaker 1: How are your grades at this time?
Speaker 2: I made straight A's.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So you--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I commended myself to do that.  Interestingly enough the Dr. Harding--Dr. Harding Young who was head of the School of Business asked me what I wanted to do for a, a--to get my--to get my thesis for my master's degree and I said as long as it's relevant to the movement [Atlanta Student Movement], (laughter) I'll take it.  And we negotiated for while and he finally said, "well why don't we do the effect of the student movement on selected businesses in Atlanta".  So I did a research job on trying to find out how many people had charge cards, how often they'd been there and how and when they stopped using their charge cards as a results of the student movement.  And my thesis generated some interesting conversation.  'Cause black folks stop buying, many of them could not pay the cards off, but they cut them up and the businesses in the community began to recognize that, that black folks were a strong economic factor in surviving if they really wanted to in, you know, in Atlanta [Georgia].
Story_ID: 64051
Speaker 1: Now at that time, which black organizations did you really--did really impress you?
Speaker 2: Didn't find any, didn't know about any, heard about the Urban League [National Urban League] very casually.  NAACP was out stamping--stomping on the ground and shouting and screaming.  SNCC was running around knocking over tin cans and demonstrating in the streets, didn't know about CORE, the Congress of Racial Equality.  And there was some black churches that had significant influence in these movements and that's where Martin [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] came in.  And his role was more of the church role, the minister role as opposed to the member of the organization.  And he's a very interesting, interesting character because he bought--he brought the oil that kinda calmed the waters when there was wind and breeze blowing, he would usually keep things calm.  It worked out very well that way.
Story_ID: 64052
Speaker 1: So Whitney Young, how did you feel about meeting this individual.
Speaker 2: Whitney was the Dean of the School of Social work at Atlanta University [now Clark Atlanta University in Atlanta, Georgia], and I had run into Whitney a couple of times shortly after the student movement was over.  And when I finished my work at Atlanta University, Rufus Clement hired me as a special assistant to the president.  What I discovered was that as the student movement began to change America, that major corporations got the word that you need to hire some black folks.  And the only place to find black people that would qualify for the jobs that they were interesting in hiring them for were from the black colleges.  And so he began to get calls from General Motors, Ford, IBM, Chrysler and some chemical companies about interviewing graduate students and we were at the graduate level.  So my basic job was to put together resumes and materials so when--and bring the recruiters to town, so when the recruiters came to town we could sit down with them and put together the kind of resume and the presentation that, that they were looking for.  I did some quick research and nosed around at some other placement offices and put together what I thought was the placement office and I put the first placement office for Atlanta University together under Rufus Clement and we had some pretty good placements.  We also tied that into some of the other schools because Morehouse [Morehouse College] and Clark [Clark College, now Clark Atlanta University] and Spelman [Spelman College] were undergraduate schools in the Atlanta University Center and so we tied that whole piece together and as a result of the movement, began to have some influence in placing people in reasonably good jobs.
Story_ID: 64053
Speaker 1: So did you feel these were sincere efforts on the part of these businesses?  Did they really want blacks--
Speaker 2: No, no,
Speaker 1: --in their--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  When the guy come to town and he, and he--well there were exceptions.  The guys who were on the liberal end of the totem pole said, "where is the place that I can stay, no I don't want to stay at the Hilton, what's the nearest hotel to the school, what's Paschal's Motel [Paschal's Motor Hotel] like, I can't find it in the book, how do I get there", etc, etc.  Those guys did get cabs and came to the Paschal's and stayed there and did their things, did the interviews, some in Paschal's, and some on campus [Atlanta University, now Clark Atlanta University in Atlanta, Georgia].  Others stayed downtown, came to the campus at nine o'clock in the morning, left at four and didn't invite us over as they did the other placement officers, I learned later, and that was kinda were we were.  But the basic--the largest majority of them were complying with, with what seem to have been a directive from somewhere upstairs that said, "let's get some folks hired".
Speaker 1: Did this create any frustration in you?
Speaker 2: I wouldn't call it frustration.  I take each of these experiences as challenges.  I recognized that there's an education that white America needed and the only way to give them the education that they needed was to kinda put them in a setting in which they had as little fear as possible.  And that they did not expect to be jumped on if they asked the wrong question.  In each of the other settings, if they asked the wrong question, they get pounced on and in other settings they found themselves kinda afraid of the environment.  I try to put them at ease and when I did that I able to get through them, I think, to them.  And this has been the hallmark of my approach to life and that's how I got involved with Whitney [Whitney Young], and Whitney at the School of Social Work [at Atlanta University], and when I got the call from Clarence Coleman at the Urban League in Atlanta--National Urban League in Atlanta--that said, "how would you like to work for the Urban League"?  I said, "doing what"?  He said, "doing for Atlanta University for 40 other schools".  I couldn't turn it down.  So I became the liaison for black schools for the South, to try to get them to put their placement offices in some kind of an order so that we could go ahead and build a schedule.  And part of my job, having linked up with some of the big industries was to get that information even down to LeMoyne College and some of the other schools all over the South, an exciting experience.
Story_ID: 64054
Speaker 1: Can you talk about the Urban League [National Urban League] and what, what it's role was at that time and how long it had been in existence?
Speaker 2: Urban--Urban League was born in 1910.  Lester Granger and the social, the social workers were involved in trying to put together the, the kind of a system that provided what I just described as an environment where folks could, could talk freely.  I think from Lester all the way to Whitney [Whitney Young], we found individuals who spent their time making white folks comfortable so they could talk freely.  And I think Whitney did a darn good job of that and not only did he provide us income for our salaries, but he influenced the thinking of people at the federal and national levels about this.  The role, I think of the Urban League was to be a broker.  The Urban League has always been broker in situations like this.  When they (unclear) fix the students were involved for example, many of the Urban League guys in my office in Atlanta [Georgia], were involved in the brokering between the mayor and the chief of police and some of the other chamber of commerce types, with the black community and you're trying to resolve some of those issues that were obviously pain for everybody.
Story_ID: 64055
Speaker 1: So you took your role as a negotiating role.
Speaker 2: I would probably leave the negotiating--the negotiations up to the power brokers, but I would like to set it up so that each understood the capacity--what they were bringing to this table and how they could best-how they could best make it work and that worked out fairly well.
Speaker 1: Now did the young blacks understand that, that this was the Urban League's [National Urban League] role?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I don't that--I don't think they--very few, very few youngsters understood the role of the Urban League and the significance of the Urban League.  I think, I think that most youngsters don't understand the significance of getting a college education their freshman year of school.  It's when they get to be junior and seniors and they realize that they got to go work somewhere that they finally began, "oh my grades from my freshman and sophomore year are gonna have a bearing on what I do when I get out".  That's, that's much what like what the Urban League is.  So it's really not--it's not easily identified as an institution nor easily identified for what it does.  Now there are a lot people who receive services from the Urban League that can vouch for it.  I guess when you think about the first affirmative action officers in the major corporations in America, 80 percent of them came from the Urban League.  The first black palace were found by the Urban League.  In fact Whitney [Whitney Young] can take credit for some of those.  The guy on the corner who find himself with a bad rap because he had a drinking problem, and finally got over the drinking problem--that rap is on his sheet. And when the personnel officers by and large see that rap, automatically they are even--not even counted.  The Urban League person will take that individual and try and make them understand that if they have really turned around and have made a decision not to behave in the former self, then we'd try to get you a job, then we'd go to work.  That's our negotiation role to make sure that, that the personnel officer who next sees them has a vision of a potential good employee.  And that's another piece that we, that we would like to spend time working on.
Story_ID: 64056
Speaker 1: Your role in the Urban League [National Urban League] and how it grew over years you were there?
Speaker 2: Well I came in the Urban League in the regional office, as it told you, as the Assistant Director for Education and I spent a lot of time trying to build the relationships among the black colleges and universities, tying them in with an industry.  And then I think I've had, I've had about 15 different titles (laughter) in my job with the Urban League.  I think Whitney [Young] worked out an interesting plan with, with President Lyndon Johnson and some other leaders in Washington and we had the new thrust--which was a lot of federal money--trying to replicate a lot of our Urban League work in a larger setting so we touch more people in what I call the Urban League style.  We dealt with issues of health, housing, employment and education.  When desegregated schools were, were struggling to make, to make them survive, we spent a lot time with (unclear) education, with teachers, both black and white--put together the leadership--teachers and understanding how best they can come together and make a difference for the students that they were working for and not among themselves.  Those were the kinds of issues that the Urban League deals with and that does not make headlines in the daily newspaper.
Speaker 1: The Urban League, in the manner in which you went about it, took out, undoubtedly, took up a great deal of your personal time.  How did that affect your personal life?
Speaker 2: I think that my commitment to the Urban League--Andrew Young made a-he was the guest preacher at the First Congregational Church in Atlanta [Georgia] in 1960-something, and I listened to Andy preach about the ministry.  He was talking about his role and function, the date--the year may be wrong, but he portrayed himself as minister as he saw his life outside of a pulpit in the world and he's talking to me.  He was saying, "God has destined that you will spend your life as a minister in the Urban League".  And that's what I did.
Speaker 1: So did that affect your personal life?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  I think that my first wife had a--had an interesting relationship with me.  She understand where I was going and she was very much in support of that.  And Mary Jay (ph.), who is my current wife, is, is very much even more radical then I am (laughter), a true radical lady.
Story_ID: 64057
Speaker 1: So back to the Urban League [National Urban League], into the '70's [1970s] late '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s], how did you see the shift in the civil rights movement now coming to an end with Dr. King's [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] death.  How did it shift and change?
Speaker 2: I don't think it really shift--it didn't, it didn't really change.  Urban League is like, the guy told me about Kellogg's cornflakes.  He said, "we've been making cornflakes since 1890 and the basic cornflakes is like it was.  We'll changed the cover every four or five years to accommodate the new generation, but we still making cornflakes".  I think the Urban League is still recognizing the value of the democracy that we live, as bad as some people may think it is.  The Urban League recognizes the significance of economics and economics survival, the value and significance of, of the dollars we, we must have.  I think the Urban League recognize the freedom that people should have, an opportunity to be a part of this great country.  And, and that as the wrinkles unfold, as the opportunity presence itself, I think the Urban League has made the adjustment to accommodate the reason why we are in being and to support the whole idea that African Americans should have a fair and equitable shot in the America that we find ourselves in.  Talking about boots, and bootstraps and the big debate about do we have boots and how can you bring up (laughter), you know, with your own boots and you have no boots on?  We believe that if we make the adjustment and we have done this many times and proven that it works.  If youngsters in the black community who are poverty-stricken and don't have access to TIME, Life, Newsweek on the desks of their tables, have an opportunity to visit an Urban League and get involved in an Urban League tutorial program and get involved in Urban League's technology center and have access to the Internet, that they, when they are finally eighteen, have just as good of shot, if their heads are in the right place, as any other kid in America to make it.
Story_ID: 64058
Speaker 1: What-- you know with, with Martin--with Dr. King [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], what was his relationship with the Urban League [National Urban League]?  Do--I mean because--I know you--like you said, it was an institution around before he even came on the scene.
Speaker 2: I don't think Martin had a, a special relationship with the Urban League.  I know there was the, the talent, there was a--there's a group of leaders, black leaders, calling--calling themselves the--something nine, that's Whitney [Young] and King and CORE and a couple guys out of Chicago [Illinois] and they would go off for three or four day seminar to talk about the strategy that they would develop and a strategic plan for the next five years and so on.  I was peripherally involved in that.  I was not directly involved in that, in that stuff.  But I do know that he was involved in discussions--but that he influenced the direction of the Urban League, I'm not sure I can say.
Story_ID: 64059
Speaker 1: Now you get involved, you take a leave from the Urban League [National Urban League] to get involved with Atlanta [Georgia] politics with Maynard [Maynard Jackson].
Speaker 2: Yes.  Maynard and I found ourselves at the First Congregational Church together and he knew about the Urban League, my regional office, and Clarence Coleman and Heman Sweatt [Heman Marion Sweatt]-the Sweatt (unclear) University of Texas debate--that was a lawsuit [Sweatt v. Painter] that was first opened up, which I'm sure you're familiar with.  Sweatt was on our staff at the Urban League and it was kinda exciting to work with a guy who had been in the trenches and his job was working with some housing program--programs and some-supporting--and doing board training and volunteer training at local Urban League levels, which is what our job was and training of guild members and someone.  We found, we found the Urban League looked on by the white community in the South as the safe place to go to get your problem solved.  And so local Urban Leagues and local communities in the South began calling the National Urban League saying, "can we get an Urban League in our community"?  And it became our job at the Southern Regional Office to go to Fort Lauderdale [Florida] and Waco [Texas] and these other towns to try and help them understand how to get an Urban League going.  We started Orlando and Fort Lauderdale and a variety of other institutions (laughter).  Urban Leagues across the South and that--and during that era, right after the student movement unfolded and that's when I got involved with the Urban League and one of my jobs was New Urban League Development in Charlotte, North Carolina and some others, Chattanooga, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Do you find working with Mayor Jackson on his campaign to be as satisfying as the Urban League job?
Speaker 2: Our set was different.  Running a political campaign is like trying to keep group of chickens in a chicken pen that has no boundaries.  There are political leaders, there are pseudo leaders, there are, there are I wanna be leaders and there are real leaders.  And then there are hidden leaders.  And the hidden leaders you have to go and dig them up to find out what's on their minds.  The rest of them are all out on the front, taking their TV cameras, what have you.  There are two or three levels of involvement here and I happen to privileged to a part of--or seeing how this whole things works.  I have to take my hat off to guys like Maynard Jackson and politicians in general who, who survived this experience.  It's a tough job (laughter).  I wouldn't have it for a million dollars.  A million, I may want to consider that.  It was, it was difficult working with volunteers.  It was trying to coordinate the whole activity.  The time constraints built in.  We had the same experience in Atlanta that they had in Florida.  Have a guy name Steve Jones who happens to be one of my buddies in town now, was the guy specifically designed to make sure that the elections were run fairly and squarely.  He was involved in the computer business at that time, worked out very well.
Story_ID: 48680
Speaker 1: And back to the Urban League [National Urban League].
Speaker 2: As I look back at the Urban League, having been involved in the, in the agency for a long time.  I was in the regional office, which didn't last very long.  Regional offices have since been disbanded.  But I can look at my counterparts in New York.  There were times in the Urban League when we'd get a call from New York that says the paychecks are in the mail but don't cash them until Monday 'cause there wasn't enough money (laughter).  And--those days--so those days are not that far back in my, in my memory.  The Urban League did have hard times and every now and again through a period of hard time.  Which I'm sure Hugh Price is having now with 9/11.  But when you think back in Whitney's [Whitney Young] time, Whitney spent a lot of time dealing with corporate leaders in their own settings being the first guy to go in to the Harvard clubs and the presidents of college campuses and talk to them on their level, using their language, having read their material and, and quoting columns from the editorial of the TIME, Life and Newsweek.  That's the Whitney Young that I remembered.  He would take us up to, to the Xerox Corporate--Training Headquarters up in New York--upstate New York and for a weekend.  And we would get the executive training that Xerox VPs got all across the country.  That was how Whitney saw, as a social worker, evolving his social work orientation into the business of human suffering in America and how it, how it should be dealt from his point of view.  And his book talks, talks a lot about, about that kind of stuff, but that's Whitney.  When Vernon [Vernon Jordan], Vernon comes to work, Vernon comes to work with a heavier voice that is a lot more direct that wastes little time trying to determine whether we're going to be comfortable in this setting or not.  Vernon is a straight-forward, "here's what we're going to do gentlemen and ladies, and now we can discuss how we're gonna get there, not whether we're gonna do it or not", different style.  And because of his height and size and his blackness and his training, Vernon was the, the black man to be admired by all and, and take that to the bank so to speak, worked our very well for him, did a good job at the Urban League.  He brought with him the voter education project orientation which he had in Atlanta [Georgia] when he was a VEP director.  And so Vernon is, Vernon's orientation made the Urban League look at it again at itself not just in terms of human services--which is helping the little ladies on the corner get their the right mind that they should for their kids for ADC and making sure the health department treated the blacks and the whites fairly when they came to get their health exams--but Vernon was more interested in making sure that the guy who ran for office understood that the constituency that he was gonna serve when he finally got in office also included black people.  And that was a new twist for the Urban League and a new perspective and a new dimension that I think we looked at differently.
Story_ID: 48681
Speaker 1: Hugh Price, Hugh Price came to the Urban League [National Urban League] from a foundational orientation.  Hugh Price was a young man who went to law school and also had seen a lot of work that was done by I--groups that had requested money to do projects and I think Hugh was involved in his early young--in his early foundation life in assessing and evaluating programs.  He knew what it took to take 'x' number of dollars and do a job.  And I think Hugh wanted to make sure that when the Urban League got its dollars, from wherever that money may--might come from that it had lea--logical, reasonable and documentable evidence that we did in fact do the job right.  And another part of Hugh is that is a very read-well man.  He understands the dynamic of how it works.  He is a Wall Street Journal guy and he also reads the Atlanta Daily World and The Columbus Times (laughter) so he has a dimension that is very broad and in perspective.  And so his approach to the Urban League has it with economics as a basis on depending where it's got to go.  If we are going to survive in America, we need to get our economic act together.  And we have not let--yet learned to do that.  The distrust that evolved from history among black people has not yet got to the stage where we are free enough and comfortable enough to sit down in the kitchen and say, "look, let's put 10 grand apiece together and start something called the 'x' program or the 'y' program.  We still have a great deal of hesitance about that and so that's holding up back, that history is holding us back.  We are also afraid to jump in stock market.  We rather go buy two houses and collect $125 month rent and then repair the roof and go back every month to collect the rent rather than put a steady, you know, $175 a month from our paycheck into a mutual fund or some other investment vehicle to make sure that the retirement plan is set up.  We have been sold on the fact that somebody set up social security to take care of us when we get old.  And so we've, we've not yet put that whole package together to make sense.
Speaker 2: So how do we educate ourselves properly, economically though the Urban League?  How can they do that--(unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Well that's what they're doing now (laughter).  That's what Hugh [Hugh Price] is doing now.  When they start talking about having press conferences in Washington, D.C., and he has access now, and talking about the, the thing that comes on every--at one o'clock every afternoon.  Well every once a month, National Press Club, conferences of the universities, those are places where we start that piece.  The second part of that is, the black institutions that still exists in the South are the, the next place where we need to start putting together the kinds of thought processes that make young folks rethink where they're coming from and how they're doing it.  You see, the generation today is not bogged down with the minutiae of grandma's memory the way I and my peers are.  Many people in the South can still hear about the cotton fields.  I mean, I'm sure you've interviewed people who talked about that.  "Grandmama use to chop cotton", and so on.  The kids today don't even know about separate water fountains.  You know, what are you talking about when you say black water and white water?  (laughter)  It doesn't make logical sense.  But they haven't yet transitioned into what the America is supposed to be.  What we hope that they don't end up with is the kind of America and the kind of thinking that causes Enrons and things of this sort--  Arthur Andersons. I mean, these are the things that we wanna try and avoid.  We gotta put some, put some starch in the morality that that is still existing in our country that we haven't dealt with.
Story_ID: 48682
Speaker 1: And what role does the black church play in all of this?
Speaker 2: The black church has an opportunity, I think, has the greatest opportunity to make a difference in America and the thinking of black people.  If you, if you think about where their trust is, you think about where their confidence is, you can think about where their spiritual values are and we do have some bumps in the road in the last ten or fifteen years.  If the mechanisms for the churches provide us a vehicle for opening up a new thought process for youngest, I think that they will see themselves in a different light with spiritual backing then they will have a little earlier.
Speaker 1: Now there are mega churches that do exist--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --churches that have 19,000, 20,000 members--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and you know of some of which I am speaking.  Do they have a special calling to do something since they have the economic backing, they have the people there.  Do they have a special purpose to do something in the community.
Speaker 2: Don't know what their--don't know--I'm not sure how they see themselves functioning.  I see the black church moving its tentacles into the unchurched and into the community in and around itself first of all and then into the broader community.  I see the church extending its tentacles just by having the word church attached to it into some of the things they have not been normally doing.  I see the churches beginning to get into recidivism rates and reducing them in the, in the prisons by bringing those young men out of jail and then reorienting them, and in a church environment moving them--not where they came from, so they end up in the same location where the guy still is selling drugs, but in another location in a church setting or in a church oriented setting.  I mean they can do some other things.  I think this is the new role of the church and, and I'm not hearing the churches do this.  I'm hearing them grow their memberships, but I'm not hearing them do the programs.  Are they competing with the Red Cross and the YMCA and the Girls Club?  Yes, they are.  But they're doing it from a different vantage point.  And if you're listening to what Bush [President George W. Bush] is saying and why he's saying what he's saying.  He is offering us an opportunity to use the vehicle of a spiritual basis for establishing a clean America.  It'll make a lot of difference in the year 2005 and 2010 if we hear the message, but we're not getting the message.  We're still stumbling and, and bumbling and dealing with the politics of the democracy and the peace of the Republicans and Democrats (laughter)that haven't yet cross the barrier of people.  And I think that's where we need to go.
Story_ID: 48683
Speaker 1: So about the Urban rules--the Urban--the Urban League's [National Urban League] role changing in the future, where do you see them going ten, fifteen years from now?
Speaker 2: I see the Urban League--I see the Urban League taking its piece and building small components of the economic piece and doing the same thing.  There is enough work out here for three organizations like the Urban League, so it's not a matter of competition; it's a matter of compilation and sharing.  I think the Urban League does have a chance to do that and can do it very well.  I mean, the very foundation and the background of the Urban League would give it a leg up on lots of other organizations.  And because it has been structured, you have to remember that, that the Urban League in the community has a have a 501(c)(3).  It's got to be--it's gotta have an office.  It's got to have a secretary and a telephone.  You know, you can't open an Urban League in the kitchen, you know.  That's not the way it works.  And you have to have it for the directors and they're accountable and you need 'x' number of dollars in the bank before you can get started.  A volunteer can't run the Urban League, a hired staff is.  So we're trying to comply with the organizational structure that America asks us to be, if we're going to be a part of the business of America.  And when we do that, when we say to the corporate community, "it's now time to give to the Urban League", then they realize that there's some legitimacy and their programs that are working and it's effective, a lot of difference.
Story_ID: 48684
Speaker 1: So tell me about the challenges of the Urban League [National Urban League] that you started right here in Columbus, Georgia.
Speaker 2: Jessie Taylor came to Columbus back in, in--thirty years ago.  And he started the first Urban League.  He started in a trailer in the back of the Friendship Baptist Church on Second Avenue--on Third Avenue.  And he grew the Urban League from that little small beginning into a solid institution that was affecting both the, the community in lots of ways, the black and white community in lots of ways.  Jessie was involved in lots of positive things.  He got sick back in the '90s [1990s] and unfortunately died back in 1993.  I came to the Urban League November the 1st and Jessie died November the 12th.  By the time I got to town, many of the things that he had successfully put in place were not able to be maintained.  So when I came to town, I, I begin to rebuild the Urban League and put together with my four basic program areas of housing, health education and jobs, economic development and employment.  See I changed the name from Jobs, to Economic Development and Employment because they economic development piece is where we, where we wanna go with that.  So we, we put together seminars and we invited black people who had been successful in their professions to come talk to us about what they were all about and how they did it.  And they described some of the challenges that segregation offered them.  They described the opportunities that black banks provided them.  They began to lay the foundations to their peers about how successful they were, what their challenges were and how they overcame them so they don't fall in the same trap that they would normally have fallen into if they didn't have this experience.  So the seminar idea of how black businesses succeed was important.  And then, of course, we wanna tie into the job situation, helping people get jobs, I described that a little earlier, and education.  Our local Urban League has a technology center put together.  We've got twenty computers they--latest equipment built into it.  The kids after school come for the computers.  And they are properly protected so that they don't end up with the junk that's get on, on the computers, but, but we hope that they will eventually be able to have pen pals in Russia, Afghanistan, China, Japan and Korea, as well as Africa.  And when you start having kids using email across the world, 2006 is gonna be a different year for the world than it is.  And you don't bomb your friends in Africa as easily (laughter) as you would if weren't emailing them.  There's some obv--obvious advantages.  And also if you're talking about getting information about the situations in other communities across the world, you can get 'em through an email from a friend of yours, it makes a world of a difference.

Speaker 1: So the Urban--the Urban League [National Urban League], in regards to the situation you alluded to, the situation that the world is in right now, terrorism, do you think that that should be on the agenda with organizations like the NAACP and the Urban League and CORE, should that be on their agenda?  Something they should talk about and be discussing, and how should they?
Speaker 2: The implication of terrorism with respect to the homeland could be on the Urban's agenda, but I think our priority, despite the idea that we are a shrinking world, needs to be a hometown priority.  We need to spend our time in America.  Between Canada and Mexico and Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, there's enough work to be done there.  Now for us to start diluting our energies dealing with stuff that may be extra-USA--that does not say we should not concern ourselves with issues that relates to African Americans military-wise and overseas-wise, disease-wise, these are the kinds of things that will affect us at home.  Yeah, we need, we need to include those into our agendas, yes.
Speaker 1: And the fight against AIDS, have you focused on that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We, we have--our piece on that is a piece that deals with education.  There's something in the mind of the African American young man that says that, "I can overcome anything".  Big enough, bold enough and bad enough and "If I can't see it I know I'm not gonna worry about it".  That has to change and it is, it is the exposure of the young--youngsters to--probably the best answer is to have models of young men who themselves have had AIDS until this issue of AIDS is resolved to get these young, young kids--guys to understand that is not an easy issue that just overflows and fall out.
Speaker 1: Do you see the burden of that on the economic com--black community?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Its affects--
Speaker 2: No.  This is an issue that, that addresses all of America.  Everybody, every--AIDS has no respect to a person's or sex or age or color, yeah.  It's everybody's business.
Speaker 1: --(unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Let me, let me amplify on that.  Because of my orientation, I am probably affected differently by people describing things to me using certain words then my white counterparts.  I would suggest that there is an advantage in having black people talk to black people about certain issues, not that white people can't talk to 'em about it, but there are some interpretations and some linguistic uniquenesses that will be an advantage if you're trying to get a message across, particularly with things like AIDS.  There are some unique opportunities here that I think we can take advantage of.
Speaker 1: Such as?
Speaker 2: Yeah,
Speaker 1: --(unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Well, I think that I could do a lot better outside the local bar on the way to Fort Benning [Georgia] than a white social worker with a Ph.D. (laughter).  That's one--a good service example, but I mean there are other ways to, to look at it also.
Story_ID: 48686
Speaker 1: And my final question, what would you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: I guess my legacy is--my legacy would probably be--I like to think of myself as trying to make sure that the people who have the responsibility of influencing whatever it is that they touch, do so with the right stuff, with the right material and in the right way and, and to the best benefit of everybody.  Let me see if I can describe that another way.  The Urban League [National Urban League] is structured so there's a president of the Urban League and there's a chairman of the board.  I had the habit of having a president of the Urban League, white, black, white, black and now I've got female, white, female, black, white, black, female.  So the job of the top guy in the Urban League that is the volunteer, which is the key person that makes the name of the Urban League in the chamber of commerce and at the social club and in the golf--on the golf course and, and in the, the presidential suites where I cannot get to.  Those guys make a determination of the Urban League's future in Columbus.  And if that man is not well-educated as to what it is that the Urban League does, if he can't speak black language, you know.  The Urban League Chairman of the Urban League Board is the best black job in town (laughter) as Whitney used to say.  If that guy cannot talk Urban League and, and if he's not brave enough to stand up and, and say, based on what the circumstances are, that here's where the Urban League stands on these issues and we want to make sure that you understand that.  Then my job is not done.  And the Urban League Guild, it seems to me, would be the female arm of the Urban League that makes things happen.  When the Ebony fashion show ends up being well done, and black and white and rich and poor and Hispanic and Puerto Rican people come to see the best costumes in the world, just because it's under the Urban League banner doesn't mean it's a black operation.  It's the best operation in town dealing with fashions.  That's what, that's what I wanted, that's what I wanted it to be.  And so if we can kinda, kinda craft these things to fit those, not black operations, but those operations, I think my job would've been, would've been well done.  When I look across the South and I think about Charlotte, North Carolina and when Purrea (ph) went down there as the first director of the Urban League, I spent a lot of time in Charlotte trying to find the white people and the rich people who would fund it.  And it does take a certain kind of person to get that package put together.  And once it's put together and it's, and its proper place, and it--you hatch that little baby bird (laughter) and it finally comes out of the egg, you kinda feel comfortable that something's happened and it--it'll be a meaningful contribution because it will continue grow.  All right.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: My pleasure.
