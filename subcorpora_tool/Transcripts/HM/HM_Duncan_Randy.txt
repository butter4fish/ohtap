Story_ID: 394654
Speaker 1: Now let's talk a bit about your mother and your mother's side of, of the family. Could you state and spell your mother's full, entire name, including her maiden name, please?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Betty Jean Mason [Betty Mason Boglin (ph.)]; that's her maiden name. And of course her married name is Betty Jean Duncan. And she's now Betty Jean Duncan Boglin 'cause she remarried about twenty years ago or so. And she's from Arkansas.
Speaker 1: And, and how do you spell Boglin?
Speaker 2: B-O-G-L-I-N.
Speaker 1: Okay. And her state of birth, as you mentioned, is, is Arkansas.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was born in a little county, a little town I, I believe called Twist, T-W-I-S-T, Arkansas, which is very close to Little Rock, part of Little Rock, Arkansas.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth?
Speaker 2: Oh, February 16th, 1940. Is that right? (Laughter) Yeah, I think so, 1940.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Good. And how much do you know about your mother's background and her growing up in Arkansas?
Speaker 2: What I know is that she, wow, was a young mother. I think she got pregnant with my older, oldest brother [Ellis Duncan] at age fifteen. And so she only attended school until like the tenth grade and then left there and went to, came to Chicago [Illinois], actually, after that, she and father [Ernest Duncan]. They got married at a very early age, obviously, and decided to move up north and so ended here in Chicago. And that's pretty much all, all I know about her as a child. You know, I know more about her as an adult than a, than a child there in Arkansas.
Story_ID: 394655
Speaker 1: And you said your oldest brother, how many siblings do you have?
Speaker 2: I actually had six. My oldest brother is, is dead now, but I had six. I had four, there were four boys, right, and two girls; that makes six, yes?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: All right, yeah, and so I'd be the seventh one (laughter), okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And where do you fall in line?
Speaker 2: I fall in the third. Yeah, there was my oldest brother, then I have an older sister, then myself, and the rest are younger.
Speaker 1: And could you give me their names and where you fall in--
Speaker 2: Wow, the oldest is Ellis [Ellis Duncan], the next one is Barbara [Barbara Duncan Lennett], which is my sister, there's me, and then Alphonso [Alphonso Duncan] is under me, and Rudy [Rudy Duncan], Derant [Derant Duncan], and Tara [Tara Duncan Simmons], yeah. And you know, they all, they live all over the place right now, yes.
Speaker 1: But basically, your mother [Betty Mason Boglin (ph.)] grew up in Arkansas as a child?
Speaker 2: As, as a child she grew up in Arkansas, and then she came up here as a young adult. I believe they came here when she was like nineteen, twenty years old, came to Chicago [Illinois] and finished whatever schooling she had up here and continued to have--well, all the kids were born here in Chicago. None of them were born--so that meant that she came up earlier, and went back there, and then came back to Chicago, yes.
Speaker 1: Are any of your other siblings dancers?
Speaker 2: Believe it or not, I'm the only one who chose the artistic field. Everybody else decided they wanted to do either sports, as, as kids, and then of course, they, once they became adults, went into the, the world of blue collar, and worked in factories and, and whatnot. But I'm the only one that really got into dance and theater and all that. Although they love it, but you know, I'm really the only one in that field.
Story_ID: 394656
Speaker 1: And your mother [Betty Mason Boglin (ph.)], did she encourage you in any way of your growing up wanting to become a dancer or?
Speaker 2: My mom, they just allowed me to do whatever I wanted to do (laughter), 'cause actually, I, I, I grew up with my grandparents [Berbie Martin Henderson and Hezekiah Henderson, Jr.], yes. Instead of my, staying with my mom, my grandparents took me, and while here in Chicago [Illinois], at like age one and a half. And so, I, I grew up with them, so I was like an only child in, in that family. But, you know, I was with my brothers and sisters practically every day. It's just that my grandmother decided, you know, she never had any boys. In trying to have one boy and one girl, she ended up with five girls. She had asked my mom who is the oldest child of the, of the sisters that she has. She had asked her if she could take me and raise me, and my mom said, "Sure, you know; I'll have more." (Laughter) And so, and so that they did, so I was raised my, by my grand, by my grandparents, my grandmother and grandfather, actually (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So your grandparents were here in Chicago when your mother moved here?
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Oh, I--
Speaker 2: --they were here in Chicago when my mom moved, moved here already, yes. So, my grand- my, my grandparents had to come up there. They were sharecroppers and, and cotton pickers. And my grandmother really had a very, very bad problem with, with asthma, and so they needed to move someplace where she could be comfortable and breathe better, so she came to Chicago, believe it or not (laughter) for that. And they left my mom there with, and, and her siblings, there with an aunt of mine who took care of them. And then she eventually moved up here when they got married and all. But, yeah, I was here with my, with my grandparents, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, did your mother tell you any stories about her growing up, or were there any sharing of how she grew up and things that happened in her life while she lived in Arkansas as a young girl?
Speaker 2: Oh, the only thing I know about really (laughter) is, is the things that happened between she and my father [Ernest Duncan] as young kids and what a charmer he was, and (laughter) how she wasn't necessarily the only girl that he was interested in. But because she's the one that ended up pregnant, he ended up marrying her. And so that is pretty much the, the stuff I know about my mom being a, a young girl. As far as doing anything athletic, you know, other than jumping double dutch, you know, outside, my mom didn't necessarily do that. Now my father, on the other hand, loved baseball and played baseball, and was here in Chicago and was on these, like, semipro leagues, and juggled. So, there was some talent there, but I didn't know, you know, how much was really, really there 'cause I didn't spend a whole lot of time with him. But as far as my mom is concerned, she worked all the time 'cause she had to take care of all these kids. You know, when she and my father separated after the last child [Tara Duncan Simmons] were born, she really had to, to work like two jobs and have other people in the family take care of us. Well, I was always taken care of by my grandparents, so that was not an issue. But the other kids, you know, she always had somebody to, to do that work. So that's really as much as I know about her as a, as a young child. And because I was such a good child, they really allowed me to do whatever I wanted. They knew that I was interested in musicals, 'cause I'd watch the musicals on television, whether it was, I don't know, Arthur Mur- not Arthur Murray, but, what's the other--I can't even think of his name right now, but you know, just 'Carousel' [Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II], 'Hello, Dolly!' [Michael Stewart].  All of those things that would come on television I would, I would watch and was always interested in, in movement. And that's really, really how all of this started.
Story_ID: 394657
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about your father. What is your father's full name, and could you spell your father's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, his name was Ernest Duncan. He died when I was fourteen.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a tragic death. So, yeah, and it's Ernest, E-R-N-E-S-T, Duncan, of course, is spelled the same as mine. I didn't spend a whole lot of time with, with him. He and my mom [Betty Mason Boglin (ph.)] were constantly having issues and problems in their marriage. Like I said, he was a guy who was a gallivanter, you know. He was, you know, with one woman one week (laughter), another another week, so my mom finally got fed up with that. And you know, they had married at such a very young age anyway. I don't think they were really ready for it. Back in that time it was very different. But she finally decided: you know, "I can take care of the kids myself. I have help with, with my siblings here, and there's the government that's out there." When she really figured out that she could get funds from the government to help her take care of her children, then she decided, "Okay, Ernest, it's done; we're, we're over this. You know, I'm tired of chasing you around, finding you in this person's home and that person's home. And we don't need to do this anymore." So, so they separated and just became friends, you know, and, and, and that was it. So I really didn't spend a whole lot of time with him. And he actually spent more time with, with my brothers playing baseball, 'cause that wasn't something I was necessarily into, even though I would play with them from time to time. But, but they were really, really into it, and I was really into acrobatics and, and dance, and--
Speaker 1: Gymnastics.
Speaker 2: --playing dress up and all of that, you know, at a very early age. So, I didn't spend an awful lot of time with him, so I can't tell you a whole lot about him. As a matter of fact, this was the first year I actually met his side of the family in a family reunion.
Speaker 1: Good.
Speaker 2: Two thousand six [2006]. Yes.
Speaker 1: In Arkansas?
Speaker 2: Actually in Atlanta, Georgia (laughter).
Speaker 1: How wonderful (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell me about that.
Speaker 2: Well, much of the family has moved to Indianapolis [Indiana], much of his family. There are still some that are there in Arkansas. But these--I found out about this, this family reunion that happens like every other year. And they had asked any of the Duncans, you know, if there are others around to, to come in. There were a couple of brothers and sisters that we knew of my father's that we did go and, and chat with from time to time. But this was really the first time that I'd ever met, you know, the Duncans. And it was amazing because they, they heard of me through (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: --the media and all that, and finally--
Speaker 1: Of course.
Speaker 2: --they're getting to meet this guy, and it's like, "Oh, my God, there he is." And it was, it was, it was fun, very different from my mother's side of the family. They're a lot quieter (laughter), you know, and most of them have gone through, you know, college education and all. Most of them are musicians, either singers, or they play the piano, or pastors of some church or, or other. It, it was really amazing to find this (unclear), this is really the side of the family where the talent comes from, 'cause my mom, you know, they are, are wonderful people, but it's really about cooking and eating and--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --(laughter), you know, and, and, and loving. I mean it's really, really a wonderful, loving family. But this other family was a little different, little bit different, yeah.
Speaker 1: And this reunion, did your entire family attend, or were you the only one that attended the reunion?
Speaker 2: I was the only one that attended this time. One of my brothers, Alphonso [Alphonso Duncan], he, he and his family had attended on another occasion, which is the reason why I said I wanted to, to go. I tried to get others, you know, to go with, but that's such a long trip from Chicago [Illinois] to, to Atlanta.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And so I was the only one there. And we vowed next time many more of us will go to, to meet them as well. Everybody was interested in, in what they were like. And my mother, of course, knew some of the, some of the people, having grown up with them and being a strong part of my father's, you know, existence. They played together and all when they were kids, and she wanted to know what was going on with many of them. So, maybe (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Good.
Speaker 2: --we'll take her next time too.
Speaker 1: Oh, good.
Story_ID: 394658
Speaker 1: So are most of your family, your father's [Ernest Duncan] side of the family, are they still in Arkansas, would you know of or not?
Speaker 2: Like I said, many of them have moved further north, and a lot of them are in Indianapolis, Indiana. I remember I was going there to see a show of a friend of mines, a friend of mine. And he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What show and what friend?
Speaker 2: This, this is a friend of mine who is in show business, Sean Blake. And there was something happening there at the, I think it's called Beef and Borders [sic. Beef and Boards Dinner Theatre] or something there in Indianapolis, Indiana. And I just went there to, to see the show that he was in. And I said I heard that there were some cousins here in, in Indianapolis. So I called my brother, and he said, "Well, look up Charles Dun- Duncan [ph.] and see if you can get a hold of him." So I looked, you know, I got the number and tried calling and couldn't get an answer, so I started looking in the book. He said, "There are some more Duncans in the book." And I said, "All right. Well, I'll check it out." There were so many Duncans in that, the, the, the white pages. I said, "Well, who am I gonna call. I don't know (laughter) these people." He said, "Just take a chance and call." There's one there that say that's a preacher. Well, we have two of them there that, that are preachers. And he said, "Look up Reverend Charles Duncan [ph.], and, and see what happens." So I did, got someone, and they said, "Well, you know, most of the folks in the book are your cousins." This is in the white pages that are Duncans. So there were like over two hundred Duncans down there. I couldn't believe it. I was just totally amazed. But he said most of them in here, they're related to you. So it was really fun to see that. And I think the next time that we have the family reunion it's going to be there, and I'm very interested in meeting even more of them. Yeah, so it was a, really, really great opportunity at that time.
Speaker 1: And, and these Duncans are your father's direct siblings, like the ministers and--
Speaker 2: They are their cousins, their brothers, their, you know, it runs the gamut, you know, uncles, aunts, you know, folks like that.
Story_ID: 394659
Speaker 1: Well, could you tell me more about your grandparents, particularly your [maternal] grandparents [Berbie Martin Henderson and Hezekiah Henderson, Jr.] on your mom's [Betty Mason Boglin (ph.)] side, starting with your mom's side of the family (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The grandparents on my mom's side, like I said before, they were sharecroppers. And my great-grandmother [Annie Martin] was living at the time also when I was growing up. And so we would call my grandmother on my mother's side, we would call her Big Mama--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and not because she was big in size, but she was, her title was--
Speaker 1: The oldest mother.
Speaker 2: --bigger than my mother. And then we'd call my great-grandmother grandma because she was there, and around, and actually lived with us for a little while. What can I say about her? She was a wonderful woman, my grandmother who had but an elementary education, but came here to Chicago [Illinois], was working in a building here downtown as an elevator operator, from my understanding.
Speaker 1: Boy.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and did that for, for many years and then decided to go back to school, to bakery school. And she (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and this is when I was a kid of, I would say, eight or nine years old. And I remember her going to school and then remember going to her graduation--
Speaker 1: How amazing (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) yeah, so that she could go and work in the, in the bakery. She was a one incredible cook, she really was. I mean, every day, every morning she would do both breakfast and prepare for dinner at the same time, while sitting there ironing, you know, sheets.
Speaker 1: Goodness.
Speaker 2: This is during the time when the sheets were not the percale, but they were the cotton sheets that wrinkled all the time.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) So she'd be there ironing that and singing and everything, you know; so, just wonderful times with, with my grandmother. And there were times, of course, she'd take ill with the asthma, and we'd get so afraid that something was gonna happen to her because everybody knew my grandmother and just loved her, and she knew everyone. And one special thing about her, I remember, she--no matter what car was on the street, she knew what kind of car it was, what year it was made. But, and I asked her, said, "How do you know all this stuff about these cars and what the details about the car was?" It was incredible. She had an incredible mind for that and also remembering everybody in the family, all the names, when they were born. And none of the rest of us can do that, even to this day.
Speaker 1: Amazing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, but that's what I remember about my, my grandmother, and once again, a woman who was very, very supportive. "Randy [HistoryMaker Randy Duncan], what do you, would, would you like to go?" I never liked going down south. I never did 'cause it was just too hot there, and it smelled of horse manure and all that stuff, and I just was not having it (laughter). So, so they'd ask me every year if I wanted to go down with them to Arkansas or to Memphis [Tennessee] to see cousins and relatives? And I would politely decline and just stay up here with my brothers and sisters and you know. And she loved taking me places because she said, "This is my son. This the one that I raised," (laughter). But I, I, I liked to be really kind of alone and do my own thing; you know, never been one to be around a whole lot of people and, and say--you know, I would just grab onto folks, and this is what I want to do. Yeah, I was never, never that way, always very independent, even as a little kid. Yeah, she used to ask me, say, "Randy, would you like a, a leather coat?" Everybody was wearing leather coats back in that time, and this was in the '60s [1960s] and all that. I said, "No (laughter)," you know, "no." And she says, "You're sure? I can go put one on the layaway for you?" (Laughter) I was like, "Big Mama, no, I'm fine without a leather coat."
Speaker 1: So you actually called her Big Mama?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, all, always, always.
Speaker 1: And everyone else did also?
Speaker 2: Everyone did also, yes, yeah. Well, the, these, these are all the, the kids and grandkids would do that. But, I should, I should say the grandkids would do it, not the nieces and nephews. You know, they would call her Aunt Berb- her name was Berbie, by the way.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: B-E-R-B-I-E, Berbie Lee, L-E-E, yeah. So, they'd call her Aunt Berbie.
Story_ID: 394660
Speaker 1: What section of Chicago [Illinois], part of Chicago is this area that we are speaking about now (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That I grew up in?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: We're talking about the Lawndale [North Lawndale, Chicago, Illinois] area, talking about the West Side of Chicago. Yeah, and Dr. Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] used to visit that area quite often--
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: --when he was here, yeah, yeah, so.
Speaker 1: And on occasions did you have a chance to see him?
Speaker 2: I never got a chance to see him live, but I always knew what was going on as far as Martin Luther King was concerned because he was there, and he was I mean literally, you know, just blocks away a lot of times he would be or walking down the street with a group of people protesting, so. And we always knew about that. And again, I was very young at that time, but I, I definitely remember Martin Luther King and the speeches that he made. And they would buy the albums and listen to him every single day.
Speaker 1: Buy the albums (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, the albums, remember? (Laughter) Yes, yeah, yes, so we learned a lot about this, this man during that time as well.
Story_ID: 394661
Speaker 1: My [maternal] grandparents were, were really, really very nice. So my grandfather, at that time she [Berbie Martin Henderson]--this particular grandfather was not my real grandfather, but he was the only grandfather that I knew 'cause she had remarried. This was her, I think her second marriage.
Speaker 2: And what was his name?
Speaker 1: His name was (laughter) Hezekiah, Hezekiah Henderson [Hezekiah Henderson, Jr.].
Speaker 2: Great biblical name (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yes, yeah, yeah. And, but he was known as Daddy, Daddy A.C. I don't know where that came from, but that's what we used (laughter) to call him, Daddy A.C. And--
Speaker 2: So it was Big Mama and Daddy A.C.?
Speaker 1: And Daddy A.C., um-hm.
Speaker 2: Cute.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't know how he got A.C., but this is what they called him. I never found out that information. I just knew that that's what he was to me. But I've, you know, eventually found out his real name, which was Hezekiah, yeah. So, it was very interesting (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And likewise, he also grew up in, in Arkansas?
Speaker 1: Yes, he--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --was from Arkansas as well, yeah. The whole family is from Arkansas.
Speaker 2: How far back in the lineage of your mother's [Betty Mason Boglin (ph.)] family can you take us in terms of her ancestors in--
Speaker 1: I do know that my great-grandmother [Annie Martin] was part Cree. Her mother was a Cree Indian [Native American]. And I don't know where the African came in, but I know there had to be one somewhere, so I do know that.
Story_ID: 394662
Speaker 1: On my father's [Ernest Duncan] side was Cherokee. And I think my great-great-grandmother was Cherokee. My great-great-grandfather was an Irishman.
Speaker 2: Your great-great?
Speaker 1: My great-great-grandfather on my father's side was an Irishman--
Speaker 2: What--
Speaker 1: --hence the name Duncan. I would think more Scottish, but they say Irish, so I said okay, we'll go with it. But there was an Irishman with the blue eyes and red hair, with the handlebar mustache, and this was my great-great-grandfather.
Speaker 2: Were there any stories told on your father's side about this--on your grandfather's [Ollie Duncan] side about this Irishman or about the concept of your--how they became together as, as one (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Are there any--
Speaker 1: How they came together as--I don't know. It's, it's, I'm, I'm still digging to find that information from people who have lived back, you know, who are seventy, eighty years old now to find out what that was all about. On my father's side of the family you can clearly see the Indian [Native American] traits in them, the, the high cheeks, the, they're very dark, these people, and the hair is pretty straight on, on my father's side of the family, that I did notice, and thin lips, you know. And so, there, there is that trait that is very strongly influenced there. And then on my, on my mother's [Betty Mason Boglin (ph.)] side, again, there's some very, very light-skinned people and again, thin lips, larger ear, earlobes, you know, so that you really see the Indian part of, of the family as well. Again, I'm not sure where the African came in. I cannot tell you that. I'm still working on it.
Story_ID: 394663
Speaker 1: Speaking of ancestors--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you mentioned that your [maternal] great-grandmother, tell me some of the stories that you had with your great-grandmother. Did she live in the same home with you and Big Ma?
Speaker 2: And Big Mama [Duncan's maternal grandmother, Berbie Martin Henderson]?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: My, my great-grandmother came to live with us for I guess about a period about five years. She had, her name was Annie Martin, by the way, Annie Martin, and she lived with my Aunt Ruthie, who was my grandmother's sister, Ruthie Hogan [ph.], who lived on the South Side of Chicago [Illinois]. So, when my grandmother came up, she actually moved in with my, when my great-grandmother, I'm sorry, came up from Arkansas, she moved in with, with my Aunt Ruthie, and so she lived there for, for a very, very long time. And then I think she had taken sick and gone to the hospital. And when she came out, my grandmother, Berbie Lee Henderson [Berbie Martin Henderson], who lived on the West Side of Chicago, decided that she would take her in for a while. And so that's what, what happened, so she lived with us for, for a quite a number of years, like I said, about five, four or five years she, she lived with us. And I once, she was sitting in a rocking chair, and I was asked her, I said, "So, so, grandma, tell me what tribe, as far as the Indians were concerned, did we come from?" And she said, "The Cree tribe." And I said, "Cree?" I'd never heard of a Cree tribe. You know, I heard of Blackfoot and all of these others, Cherokee Indians [Native American] and stuff, but a, a Cree? And I was saying, I said, "Did she mean Creole?" (Laughter) You, you know, like are we actually part French or something and she was saying that? I never, you know, questioned her on that 'cause I think well, if she says Cree, then I guess. So (laughter), I decided after her death that I would go to the museum of natural history [The Field Museum] here in Chicago and check out the little Indian section. So I went over there, and sure enough, there was a Cree tribe, and there are Cree, there are still Cree Indians here in the, in the states. Most of them are, like, I believe in Montana, believe it in not, and obviously in Arkansas. But I was like wow, that's amazing. And it talked about how they were considered the best dressers and all that. And they showed the kind of garb that they wore. It was quite fascinating--
Speaker 1: Unique.
Speaker 2: --and of course, very proud of their feathers and everything that they had. And I was like, my goodness, she was right, there is a Cree tribe. I mean she obviously--her, her mother was pure Cree. She was a pure Indian, you know, Cree. And I, again, did not get to know what her father was or did; I mean had to be the African American, or I, I just didn't know. My great-grandmother was a very fair-skinned woman, who, again, had very keen features, you know, the, the small lips and the, the nose of an, of an Indian actually, and very long ears. This is why I knew that this would, that she was really, and very high cheekbones, that she really had come from, from an Indian, 'cause she looked more Indian to me than she did African American actually. But, as we went down and you see the variations and the colors of her kids, and she had like thirteen I believe, yeah (laughter), it went from very light to very dark. And so there, there it all was, the diversity in color there right in one family. But, that's really what I, what I remember about, about my great-grandmother, Annie Martin; again, a very, you know, blessed woman, who loved life, and loved her kids, and loved the grandkids, and great-grandkids, as we were. And she was a, a sharecropper in Arkansas. I do remember that. And I have a lovely picture on my piano with both she and, and her husband, Luther, Luther Martin [ph.]. So, there was a very nice little family there, well, big family, as they were.

Speaker 1: And where exactly on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] did you grow up?
Speaker 2: I grew up in the Lawndale [North Lawndale] area of Chicago [Illinois] as a, as a young child from, say, age--well, when I was an infant until I was in third grade. Then we moved to the South Side of Chicago, my [maternal] grandparents [Berbie Martin Henderson and Hezekiah Henderson, Jr.] and I, and stayed there until the fifth grade, and then I moved back to the West Side of Chicago (laughter) and lived in the Austin [Chicago, Illinois] area. And while I was in the Austin area, I went to grammar school at Medill, Joseph Medill [Joseph Medill Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] grammar school from fifth grade to eighth, which was in the Robert Taylor Homes [Chicago, Illinois], near the Robert Taylor Homes, which is a project here in Chicago. And that's where my brothers and sisters were because my mom [Betty Mason Boglin (ph.)] was living in the project at, at that time. And so I decided to go there until I graduated eighth grade. And then I would go back to the Austin area for school, for high school, and then I attended Austin High School [Chicago, Illinois] for the four years.
Story_ID: 394665
Speaker 1: Just ending up on your, in terms of your grandparents, so there was very little that you knew about your grandparents on your father's [Ernest Duncan] side?
Speaker 2: Very little that I knew about my grandparents on my father's side, except for my grandmother was, her name was Clifford Duncan [ph.], as I, as I know, and she played the piano. And that's as much as I can tell you about her. I did not know my, my grandfather [Ollie Duncan] at all. But that was my, my grandmother, and she had, I think, like five or six kids. But the only two that, other than my father, that we dealt with was my Aunt Irma [ph.] and my Aunt Pauline [ph.]. So those are the only two we really knew--oh, I'm sorry--and my Uncle Chauncey [ph.]; he's (laughter) another one, my Uncle Chauncey, which is a very nice guy who actually married, he married my mother's [Betty Mason Boglin (ph.)] cousin, so there was that thing going on. So there was two brothers that married two first cousins. So, and that's as much as I know about, about him. Again, I'm, I'm digging myself, trying to find more information (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Good.
Speaker 2: --and more history about the lineage of, of both families, because I feel that it's really important to know, especially now that I've run into these Duncans this past year.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I really, really want to know more about them.
Story_ID: 394666
Speaker 1: Do you resemble your mother [Betty Mason Boglin (ph.)] or your, your father [Ernest Duncan]?
Speaker 2: There's a mixture of both, they say. They say that I look a lot like my father. But I look at my, one of my brothers, and I think he looks more like my father than any of us do. But there's a, there's a strong resemblance there. Yeah, I have a nice little picture at home of him in, in his youth, and yeah, there's a strong resemblance.
Speaker 1: And in terms of personalities, who would you say that--
Speaker 2: My mom, definitely; there's no doubt about it--
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: --that I absolutely have more of my mother's personality, yes.
Story_ID: 394667
Speaker 1: Well, what is your earliest, what are some of your earliest memories growing up as a, as a child (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Wow, some of my earliest memories--
Speaker 1: Or the earliest memory.
Speaker 2: --growing up.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I can tell you the earliest memory that I have is when I began to walk. I absolutely remember that, and I remember having a blue bottle in my hand with sugar water in it, 'cause my (laughter), my parents [Betty Mason Boglin (ph.) and Ernest Duncan] used to--in order for us to like the, the water better, they put a little sugar in it as babies (laughter). So, I do remember that; I remember that little plastic blue bottle with a white cap on it and, and having some sugar water. But I, I honestly remember beginning to walk.
Speaker 1: How old were you?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think I was close to one year old or something, yeah, yes, because my, my mother told me my, my [maternal] grandmother [Berbie Martin Henderson] took me when I was like one, like either one or one and a half years old. So, and, and I, I do remember walking down the hall and going to, from one parent to, to the other. So that is really my earliest memory. And I know a lot of kids can't remember that, that far, but, but that I do, definitely.
Speaker 1: Incredible.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Incredible.
Story_ID: 394668
Speaker 1: What are some of these other early memories you had as a child?
Speaker 2: As a child (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --I remember growing up and playing with, with my brothers and, and sisters. And we used to go and put each other on the shoulders and stand on the shoulders and walk down the hall with our hands on the ceiling and doing all kinds of little tricks from 'Bozo's Circus' ['The Bozo Show']. That is, 'Bozo's Circus' was a big influence in my life, I got to tell you, hugely influence. I don't know whether you know 'Bozo's Circus' or not, but here in Chicago [Illinois] it played in WGN-TV. And it would always come on for an hour each day, Channel 9. I remember this. And we would be on break from twelve until, until one at school. So I would get home in enough time to watch the middle part of the 'Bozo's Circus,' which is when they had the, the little invited guests come on as acts, whether they were acrobats, or whether they were jugglers, or folks who were gonna be playing, you know, French horn or whatnot, or having a little monkey come out and, and play. So there was that, and oh, there was also the Grand Prize Game. But I was more interested in the acrobatic acts because there was always something with movement that I enjoyed as a kid, which is part of the reasons why I am who I am today. But the biggest, the biggest influence was 'Bozo's Circus.'
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, it was 'Bozo's Circus,' believe it or not. I learned how to split from watching 'Bozo's Circus.' I learned how to tumble from watching 'Bozo's Circus.' And this is all self-taught.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: I'd see a trick that, that they did, whether they were bending their back, if, if it was a contortionist, and I'd go home and I'd, well, after school, and try what I saw in the early afternoon, and learning to stretch, just, you know, it was absolutely incredible. And I just wanted to try everything. So I'd ask my, you know, brother, "Here, put me on your shoulders; let's walk around like these guys on the stilts (laughter)," you know--
Speaker 1: Amazing.
Speaker 2: --'cause we saw that, yeah, yeah. But it was a huge, huge influence as a child, yes. And finally, when, it wasn't until I saw 'West Side Story' on television, I was, I believe, let's see, twelve, about ten years old, and I saw 'West Side Story,' and I decided that's what I want to do.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: I want to be a dancer, yeah, yep.
Speaker 1: So starting out very young with acrobats and, and doing gymnastic (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --function--
Story_ID: 394669
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, 'West Side Story' truly inspired me. But the early movies, the early musical movies that would, that would come on, those were also very inspiring. And I'd, I'd watch them all the time, from Elvis Presley, all the time, watch Elvis Presley movies, so, you know.
Speaker 2: The dances.
Speaker 1: (Singing) "You know that can't be true," you know. And I, you know, all of that stuff, I just loved it, 'Jailhouse Rock,' all that stuff. But anything that would come on that had music to it, any movie musical, I would, I would watch, but it was particularly 'West Side Story' that said, "Boom, I want to do that; I want to do that." Yeah, because they were flipping; they were singing; they were dancing. And you know, they had regular clothes on, and it wasn't like they were in tights and leotards. It was, it was really fascinating to, to watch. And so, two years later when I was twelve, there was actually an audition for 'West Side Story' [Arthur Laurents] a high school audition. I wasn't even in high school yet, but I called in and asked if I could audition anyway, and they said sure. This was the first time they're gonna have this all-city production, you know, of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And what year was that?
Speaker 1: That was in '72 [1972] I believe, yeah. And I, I, I, I, I had called and said, "Well, I'm not in high school, but can I come and audition anyway. I'm in eighth grade." And they said, "Well, sure," and so I came down. And there were all these high school students, I mean like over a thousand kids waiting to audition for this, which was gonna be a, a premier of this, or maiden venture, for 'West Side Story' that was going to take place at the Civic Opera House [Chicago, Illinois]. So, I went down, and I'd never, remember, I've never had any training before; it was all self-taught. So there were all these people that were there. And some of them were really good, and some of them really weren't so good. But there were a lot of folks there who had some training before. And the choreographer said, you know, she called a number of us up to come and do what she did, just kind of replicate what she did, and I said okay. I didn't know what an audition was at first, but I found out real fast. So I went up there and did that and came and sat back down. I said, "Hm, I don't think I did really well." But on the sheet for the audition, the, the publicity sheet, it said they were looking for acrobats. And so, I raised my hand amongst all these thousands of folks, and I raised my hand. I said, "I thought you were looking for some, some acrobats for the show." And she said, "Well, can you do any?" You know, now there's a panel of judges up there as well. And I looked around, and I said, with my little young self, I said, "Well, yeah." They said, "Well, come on up, and let's see (laughter)," and so I, I came up on stage and did all my little 'Bozo's Circus' ['The Bozo Show'] tricks (laughter), and I got this great applause, and next thing you know I was a Shark.
Speaker 2: Amazing.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that started everything off. And she asked me if I wanted a scholarship at the school where she was teaching, which was Sammy Dyer School of Theatre [Sammy Dyer School of the Theatre] here in Chicago [Illinois]. And I said sure. I went back home and you know, parents [Betty Mason Boglin (ph.) and Ernest Duncan], everybody was so, so happy that I went off and did, and this was all on my own. Nobody's pushing me to do anything. I just went out there and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Curiosity--
Speaker 1: --and did it, yeah.
Speaker 2: --and talent.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I think that's when they found out this boy's got something. Yeah, so, that's how it all started off though.
Story_ID: 394670
Speaker 1: So as a very young--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --Randy [HistoryMaker Randy Duncan], were you shy? Were you outgoing? Were you (unclear)? How did you--
Speaker 2: I would say that I was quiet. I was a quiet young person. I wasn't shy because I sang in church, you know. Any time you had to do the work, I went and did it. There was no doubt about that; I just did it. But I was, I was pretty quiet. I was pretty much to myself. I didn't get out there and do it. But I could do everything. I mean I'd could go out there; I'd jump rope with the girls; I could, I learned how to twirl a baton, you know, at earl- watching 'Bozo's Circus' ['The Bozo Show'] (laughter) you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --twirl a baton. You know, I saw girls in the, in the, when I was in sixth grade I believe, crocheting, you know. And in the '60s [1960s] and, and '70s [1970s] this was really something that they were into. And I didn't even know what a crocheting needle really was, but I saw it had a little hook on the end of it. And I was seeing these wonderful things that these people were making, whether they were hats with the, with the beer can thing on the side with the flaps coming down, or a little sweater vest. And I thought that's really cool. And I said how do they do that, and where, what kind of thing is that that they're using? 'Cause they weren't knitting needles. And I saw that little hook at the end. I said, "Hm, you know what," you know these hangers that come from the cleaners they have? If--the, the cardboard one--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --if you take it off, it has a little hook at the end. So I went (laughter) and I got me some yarn, and I started--
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I went and made my little hoop. And I was watching how the girls were doing it, and I started making--
Speaker 1: Fascinating.
Speaker 2: Yeah, made me a little scarf and little hat and everything with a, a hanger. You know, I cut it off and used that little hanger with the hook on the end to make my first garment crocheting. So I, I was always self-taught with, with a lot of things, you know. Whether it was singing, whether it was doing the acrobatics, or, or, or dancing, that's the way it was. And when I finally got in a dance class, after my audition at the, for 'West Side Story' [Arthur Laurents] it was just remarkable, you know. And that day forward I continued to take class.
Speaker 1: Goodness, you were very (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --innovative as a child.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Very innovative.
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, my, my mom [Betty Mason Boglin (ph.)] and them, they thought I was gonna be a hairdresser or something because I would go and comb their hair all the time, and you know, they, you know how black women are, want their hair oiled and scratched and--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So they had, "Come on over here, Randy, here, part my hair and scratch and put some oil in it (laughter)," you know, so. So I was doing that as a, as a kid as well, and playing basketball, and football, and just everything.
Speaker 1: Amazing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I just wanted to do it all. I wanted to learn everything.
Story_ID: 394671
Speaker 1: Well what are some of your, tell me about what sights, sounds, and smells remind you of your growing up.
Speaker 2: Oh, my goodness, the smell of burning leaves. There was a, an older man who owned the place that we lived in, in the Lawndale [North Lawndale, Chicago, Illinois] area. And at that time you could burn leaves in your front yard. Of course you can't do that now here. But, and the smell of that and the pipe that he used to smoke when he was doing it just reminds me of when I was a kid, jumping around and doing flips on the concrete and, and, and such. So, in terms of those smells, that really, really puts me back there. A, a rainy, damp day reminds me of when I was a kid at the playground, going over there in the dampness and getting on the, the merry-go-round or on the slide and sliding in the rain, that brings me back; going to a, an elementary school and smell the buttered cookies that we used to call lunchroom cookies here in Chicago [Illinois] from, that they cooked in the--or, they, they baked in the Chicago Public Schools, the high schools and grammar schools. I don't even know whether they still do it, but oh, my God, they were so, so good, so good. The taste of a bologna sandwich with, with Red Hots put inside (laughter) of them on white bread and mayonnaise, those are the things that remind me of when I was, a child, it, it, it does; to see the trains, the "L"s [elevated train] pass by just for a moment, it reminds me of when I was a kid. And my mom [Betty Mason Boglin (ph.)] used to take us all tow and hand and, and to the Wrigley Field [Chicago, Illinois] to see the Cubs [Chicago Cubs] play or to the Riverview [Riverview Park, Chicago, Illinois] that we had here, which was a theme park at that time. All these kids, she'd, you know, have us all like this and just take us on, on the "L" to the these various places. So, I'm, I'm reminded that when I see certain things and, and certain days when they're dark and seem gloomy, that's what I think of.
Story_ID: 394672
Speaker 1: What is it actually, your, your elementary school where you attended, what elementary school?
Speaker 2: The first elementary school that I attended was Leif Ericson [Leif Ericson Elementary School; Leif Ericson Scholastic Academy], which is in the Garfield Park area here in Chicago [Illinois], on the West Side, the Lawndale [North Lawndale, Chicago, Illinois] area. So that was my first school. I still remember my, my kindergarten's name, Ms. Easily [ph.]. And I remember when she rapped me on the hand with a ruler. You know, back in that time, you could do anything to the kids (laughter), you know. They were misbehaving, you know, you did. And not that I was behaving, but sometimes she'd make a mistake and think that it was me when it was somebody else. And she'd come over and give me a little whack on the hand. So I, I do remember that. I remember playing with the big puzzles at that time. I also remember my first day going to that school and just crying the whole day because it was, it was a real, it was really traumatic for me to leave home and be here and just dropped off. And you know, there's no family around here to take care. Now, by the same token, my younger brother [Alphonso Duncan], who's only eleven months younger than I am, but because he was born on December 1st, versus after that, he could go to school at the same time. I had to wait a whole year before I could start, to start school, so we started at the same time, but he was in a different classroom. And I heard that he didn't cry when he went (laughter), so. So the second day I said, "Well, if he didn't cry, then I'm not gonna cry (laughter)." And you know, so that, that eased that, that whole thing up. But I, I remember those days as well and, and, and having a good time back in that--and then, left there and went to a school on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] called Cook School [Cook Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois]. I didn't stay there very long 'cause we were only there for a couple of years before we moved to the Austin [Chicago, Illinois] area on the West Side one more time, in which where I attended Medill School [Joseph Medill Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois]. And I attended there from like fifth all the way up to eighth grade and graduated from there and then attended Austin High School [Chicago, Illinois].
Story_ID: 394673
Speaker 1: Were you always more taller than the other--
Speaker 2: The other kids (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) children in your, in your class?
Speaker 2: I can't really say whether I was at that time or not. You know, when we're that young a lot of times the girls are, are big, and I do remember some tall girls at the time. And I, and maybe I just shot up after a while. But no, I always remember being able to carry my own, though. And you know, when it came to fighting and the guys thought that they could outdo me or something, I'd take three of them on at a time. Yeah, so, it was no big thing. I used to watch, I, I was really very, very fond of the, the, 'The Avengers' back in that time from--there was a, a British television series that would come over here, and I, I used to, to watch that, with Emma Peel.
Speaker 1: It was called the 'The Avengers.'
Speaker 2: 'Avengers,' yeah, yeah. And I'd watch Emma Peel and Steve [sic. John Steed], I forget what his last name is now. But I always wanted my ma, my mom [Betty Mason Boglin (ph.)] to be a policewoman for some reason 'cause I wanted her to be like Emma Peel. And so I learned a lot of lessons from watching her. She, she used karate and judo to fight off the, the enemy (laughter). So, I did that, but I also took some martial arts as a, as a kid too they had at the, the community field house. So I was into that as well. And when I would transfer schools, you know, everybody want to try you. "Let's see how bad he is," you know. And so after school, like every day, here they come, the big bullies. And so I just put my books down, "Okay, let's go, let's do it, and I got fifteen minutes (laughter), and I got to be home," okay. So, there was always that, always, growing up.
Speaker 1: And how long did you practice martial arts?
Speaker 2: That was like for about a summer, you know. They had that stuff going on. But again, I, I was always a kid who was an initiator of stuff, so I'd learn pretty quickly. It, it just really didn't take me long to, to catch on to stuff at all. I was more interested in, in dance than anything else, you know, but I did want to be able to take care of myself as well, so, and I didn't want to have to always go to my brother or my sister; I didn't have to go to. She came to our defense immediately, immediately. She was so bad, she'd take her gym shoes to school just to fight, you know (laughter). She was one rough, rough cookie, I'm tell you, yes. So, the rest of us are really cool, but my sister, do not mess with the Duncans 'cause she is gonna come out and get ya.
Story_ID: 394674
Speaker 1: Were there any favorite teachers at, or subjects that you had while you were in elementary school?
Speaker 2: While I was in elementary school, English.
Speaker 1: English?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. I had to take reading, a special reading class in fifth grade because when I came over to that particular school, to Medill [Joseph Medill Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], I was not at the level that I should have been in reading. And I was wondering, well, why is that, you know? And I think it was because I played so much (laughter) when I was on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois]. I wasn't really paying much attention that, that I came there. But again, like, I'm such a quick study. And when you focus and when they have you in that little focus group, you just do it. And I became like one of the best readers there.
Speaker 1: Good.
Speaker 2: Matter of fact, tops in my, in my class when--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --when I graduated. So, it was my favorite subject.
Speaker 1: English (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It really was, yeah, yeah. I did well in math also. I did well in all the subjects in high school [Austin High School, Chicago, Illinois]; I mean, the kind of straight A student. And it wasn't because I liked them. It was because I had to do them, and so I did it. And I, you know, did my work there, then went on to dance class afterwards, yeah.
Speaker 1: So from the time that you auditioned from, in 'West Side Story' [Arthur Laurents] you were taking dance classes from the eighth grade on (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes. Absolutely, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And prior to that you were mostly on your own and--
Speaker 2: I was on my own with--
Speaker 1: --creating your--
Speaker 2: --'Bozo's Circus' ['The Bozo Show'].
Speaker 1: --own dances and--
Speaker 2: That's right, yeah. And then I continued to watch 'Bozo's Circus' (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) How long did 'Bozo's Circus' come on at that time? From the time you were a child up until the time you were in high school?
Speaker 2: Oh, it, I think 'Bozo's Circus' just stopped showing recently, maybe two or three years ago, you know. And I think they can, you might be able to get it in syndication now as well, but yeah, yeah, all the way through high school. And you know, I'm definitely an adult now, so (laughter), yeah, yeah, yeah. But I continued to watch it whenever I could.
Story_ID: 394675
Speaker 1: --In high school, but I, I was, I remember taking class. This is what it was (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, your classes, favorite classes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, my favorite classes. And certainly in grammar school I became one of the top, the top students and then aced everything in high school, while taking dance class, 'cause I wanted to get all my work done. So I did all my homework in school. I didn't take a lunch break on my, you know, they give you those study hall breaks. All of that was (unclear), and I worked in high school. I, I worked in, in the programming office. So I would get up very early in the morning and get to school about seven, do my programming work for two hours, and then go right into class, whatever class that may have been, whether it was Spanish, or English, or geography or what have you. But I'd spend that day doing everything, got all my homework done in school; started working with the cheerleaders after that because I'd heard that they needed some help. So I, I went over, since I was all ready to take- studying acrobatics at Sammy Dyer School of Theatre [Sammy Dyer School of the Theatre, Chicago, Illinois] and 'Bozo's Circus' ['The Bozo Show']. I (laughter), I, I started working with them, so I worked with them right after school. And then I'd leave from there and go to the dance studio and, and rehearse. And then at the age of, in 1974, as a matter of fact (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And this is Austin High School [Chicago, Illinois], correct?
Speaker 1: This is Austin High School, yes, yes. I attended all four years at Austin High School, and five thousand students at that school, by the way, at that time.
Speaker 2: Goodness.
Speaker 1: Yeah. And people there, believe it or not, they knew me as a singer, as opposed to a dancer at all, because I had, you know, I'd joined the choirs there. I think I was like three or four choirs there, and there was also a soloist when they'd have solos for the, for the various numbers. But I was actually taking dance, and a lot of people didn't know that. They did not know. They knew I was a part of All-City Chorus [All-City High School Chorus] and All-City Theatrical Troupe [All-City High School Theatrical Troupe], but they, you know. And I, I just wanted that to be quiet on the side 'cause I didn't want folks, okay, now we're gonna pick on him here in high school for doing blah, blah, blah, blah. But in, in, in actuality, they were very encouraging. And they couldn't believe I was doing all this stuff outside of school and still making straight A's. And the one, one teacher said, "You must be pretty doggone good. See, that's all I've got to say. I don't know how you (laughter) do it, but you must be pretty good." And I said you know, when you focus, and pay attention, and you know that you want to get out of here, you do the work; you go and do the work. There's no sense in, you know, you being behind on anything, on any subject if you just get it done. Read the material and do it. So that's pretty much the way that it was.
Story_ID: 394676
Speaker 1: Uh, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What year was this in this, in high school, from the 1975 --
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --to '79 [1979]?
Speaker 1: I graduated in '77 [1977], '77 [1977], '76 [1976], '75 [1975], '74 [1974], '74 [1974], '74 [1974] on. And in '74 [1974] is also when I joined Joseph Holmes Chicago Dance Theatre. And there--
Speaker 2: How did you gain that experience?
Speaker 1: Well, there was a, a mutual friend. Joseph Holmes knew this drummer who was friends of, of somebody who was in the theatrical troupe when I was in 'West Side Story' [Arthur Laurents] and then 'Carousel' [Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II], and 'Hello, Dolly!' [Michael Stewart] and the rest 'cause I was in each production in high school that they had for the All-City [All-City High School Theatrical Troupe]. And All-City only, only met on Saturdays, so that was pretty easy. We met on Saturdays. We learned all the material we had to do, whether it was dance or singing and acting. And then we put it together in a, a few months, and then we had the performances.
Speaker 2: Now this was a predominantly African American environment (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, no, no, no, no, not at all, not at all. The All-City High School was, was really completely diverse, completely. I mean, you're talking, it was my first time, by the way, another eye-opening experience, first time being with Hispanics, being with Asians, and being with Caucasians, all in the same group in the same room. I man the only real Caucasians that I knew were my teachers growing up in grammar school. But we didn't have any, the, the communities that I lived in were, were predominantly black if not all black. So--
Speaker 2: But then you left for school, and then schools were fully integrated when you were in school from the time that you were in first--
Speaker 1: From the time I was in-
Speaker 2: --grade on--
Speaker 1: --grammar, from the time I was in grammar school, all the way through highs school, those were predominantly black. The only thing that was completely integrated was All-City High School Theatrical Troupe.
Speaker 2: Got you.
Speaker 1: Where we did the 'West Side Story,' and then 'Hello, Dolly!' and 'Carousel,' and, and, and so forth, completely integrated. And that was the most fabulous experience because it brought me out of that, that box or that community where, you know, there is someplace else out here. There are people that really can work together and have fun together and be of different races. So that was a huge, huge ordeal for me to see that when, in fact, all this other time we were basically maybe in Austin High School [Chicago, Illinois] there were two or three whites when I went there, when before, it was all white. And then the blacks started moving to the community, and all the whites moved out. They called it white flight I believe (laughter)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --at that time. But it, it was, it was qui- quite an eye-opening experience to come and do that. Gosh, and the world was so much bigger then, so, so much bigger. And I really felt sorry for a lot of people that were left behind in those communities where they weren't looking out and seeing that there was someplace else to go. You know, they just got stuck right there. But in '74 [1974] I joined Joseph Holmes Chicago Dance Theatre.

Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now getting back before--
Speaker 2: I'm sorry (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) the Joseph Holmes Chicago Theatre [Joseph Holmes Chicago Dance Theatre], what roles were you playing when you were in 'Hello, Dolly!' [Michael Stewart] and the 'Carousel' [Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II]?
Speaker 2: Oh, oh.
Speaker 1: Give me a--
Speaker 2: When I was in high school [Austin High School, Chicago, Illinois] and doing those musicals?
Speaker 1: Yeah, what, yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, in 'West Side Story' [Arthur Laurents] I was Indigo [sic. Indio], one of, one of the Sharks, and I got to say one line, you know, "You came with your pants open." You know, I was talking to, to my female partner, and she slaps me on the face. I remember that, you know, as, as one of the Sharks, which were the Puerto Ricans. And we were all considered Puerto Rican. I was certainly fair-skinned enough to go that route. The other team, the, the Jets, were the darker skinned black people and the white folks, so they were all together. They were one gang, and then there were, they were against the Puerto Ricans in our version of 'West Side Story.' So (laughter)--
Speaker 1: How often was that production, how often did that production occur here in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Well, the, the, the 'West Side Story' only happened, I think we had maybe a month run, you know, on the weekends there at the Civic Opera House [Chicago, Illinois]. And then the next production, and you have to audition each, each year to get in. The next production was 'Carousel.' And of course, again, it was, it was a diverse group of singers and dancers, you know. They really, really wanted to make sure that it was multiracial every time. In 'Carousel,' I was just one of the lead dancers in, in that production. In 'Hello, Dolly!' that we did after that, I was Ambrose Kemper, who is the, Tommy Tune played it. And if people have seen the movie with Barbra Streisand, he's the one that played that one. So I did have more lines in that. And you know, that's the way it was. In, in 'Guys and Dolls' [Abe Burrows and Jo Swerling], I, again, was one of the dancers in, in that production. I was always really big. You know, everybody wanted to choose me for the dance roles.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: So, yeah, so that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So those were--
Speaker 2: --what happened.
Speaker 1: --four major productions before you joined the Joseph Holmes Chicago Theatre.
Speaker 2: Actually, before and during, while I was with Joseph Holmes. Because, again, we only rehearsed on Saturdays at All-City High School Theatrical Troupe. So Joseph was basically at that time during, doing a local productions here in Chicago at Kennedy-King College or at, there's a, Dunbar High School [Dunbar Vocational High School; Dunbar Vocational Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] on the south- those were our venues in the early days, in the '70s [1970s]. And then we didn't move in, into the big, big time until I became the artistic director. And that's when we were doing the Auditorium Theatre [Chicago, Illinois], the same theater that the Alvin Ailey [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater] performs in and the Civic Opera House, which is where a number of the ballet companies perform, the international companies. So it really wasn't until that time that we started really going big and, and touring internationally as well.
Speaker 1: And how long were you with the Joseph Holmes before you became the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Artistic director?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I was with the company for twelve years before I came the artistic director and continued to be with them for seven more, so it was nineteen years in total. And I continued to dance for two more years after I became the artistic director and then just decided to, to stop dancing and just direct, and teach, and choreograph.
Story_ID: 394678
Speaker 1: Well, let's talk about the time after high school [Austin High School, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --prior to your leaving for college. Now, where in this scheme of your, your life were you prior to the, the Joseph Holmes Dance [Joseph Holmes Chicago Dance Theatre] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well--
Speaker 1: You, you graduated from high school in--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I graduated from high school (laughter)--
Speaker 1: --sev- (laughter)--
Speaker 2: --with honors (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I wanted to get my feet wet in college, so I'd asked Joseph [Joseph Holmes] if I could take a leave of absence from the dance company and go to school. So I auditioned for Illinois State University [Normal, Illinois] in their vocal music major program 'cause I didn't want to go into dance, that, I mean I already danced. Why was I gonna get a degree in that? And so I auditioned and got a scholarship there at the Illinois State University. And I was training under a Peter Schuetz, who was the baritone, baritone professor there. And so--
Speaker 1: This is Illinois State University in Carbondale [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No, Illinois State University is in Normal-Bloomington [Bloomington-Normal, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Normal-Bloomington.
Speaker 2: Normal-Bloomington, Illinois, yeah, yeah. Southern Illinois [Southern Illinois University] is Carbondale.
Speaker 1: Right, exactly, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I've gone to all of them, you know, just (laughter) I've, I've, I've either taught there or, or something, you know. But I went there as a vocal music major. So I go there, and I auditioned also for the musical they were having in my freshman year, only to find out that they could not accept first semester freshmen in the musical because they wanted, they wanted them to really take in the academics and all that of the, of the university before they immersed themselves in, in some big musical, you know, and so everything else will fall by the wayside. However, they noticed that, you know, that I had a little talent, so I also auditioned for the dance department there. And after coming there to audition, they said, "Wow, you really have a lot of training." And you know, for a guy to come in with this amount of training was just incredible at that time. So they asked if I knew this technique and that technique. And they were talking about Graham [Martha Graham] and Horton [Lester Horton], and I've studied those various techniques with, with Joseph Holmes. And I said, "Well, yes." They said, "Well, can you teach? Would you mind teaching us a class in that?" And these were the professors there. So I said, "Sure." So I'd start a Saturday class, and everybody would come (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tell me more about these techniques and the difference in these techniques.
Speaker 2: The, well, the, the, the Graham technique is Martha Graham, of course, and she designed a technique based on the contraction of the torso and, and the pelvis, and also very much married to, to ballet. But it all starts in the center on the floor sitting, and so you get a nice strong back, and incredible abdomen, and a great sense of, of pride and, and strength. Every time I see, you know, like a spiral in the back, you know, you think of, of Martha Graham in such a way. And it's a modern dance technique, so it's a codified technique, and then Horton is Lester Horton. And those who are familiar with the Alvin Ailey company [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater], this is the technique that they're based in, which is more linear in terms of its line and all, whereas Graham is, is a lot more aggressive and, and visceral in, in its approach to, to movement, and dramatic, very, very dramatic. So, that, those are the two techniques that, that we were talking about. And they had asked me if I would mind teaching a class there, you know, or conducting class there, and I said, "Well, sure, I'll, I'll do that." And so I started doing that. And then it went into choreographing things for the dance group and then choreographing for the, the theater, the musical theater productions. And I was like, well, if I'm gonna do this, I might as well go on back home (laughter) and do it all professionally, you know, and really get paid for it, 'cause you know, you didn't get paid in college (laughter). So, after being there for two years, I decided I was gonna go back home and, and continue with Joseph Holmes and, and perform as a professional dancer. And so I just continued to do that, and in which time, Harriet Ross, who is now my, my manager, she was a, a teacher at the, at Joseph Holmes. And she had just come from New York [New York], and she's a graduate of the High School of Performing Arts [Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts, New York, New York], and Juilliard [The Juilliard School, New York, New York], and has studied extensively with, with Graham and the people who have, who have trained with Graham and, and have been in her company. And Harriet was just an incredible, incredible teacher and coach. So she comes to Chicago [Illinois], and this is where I first meet her at age fifteen, (laughter) yes, yeah. So she was actually a mentor of mine and she was like my teacher in the beginning who then became my associate artistic director, 'cause she had become the associate artistic director of Joseph Holmes when he was alive. And when I took over the company she still remained in the position, so she was the associate artistic director of the company.
Story_ID: 394679
Speaker 1: Now tell me more about Joseph Holmes and how his involvement in Chicago's [Chicago, Illinois] dance circuit all, do you know much about his background and his--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, when Joseph (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) engagement?
Speaker 2: Joseph Holmes was a very tall guy, first off (laughter). He was like 6'3", 6'4" or something, who first started here in Chicago probably in the '60s [1960s], and people remember him from that. He had what they consider an African American dance company, and they did like Afro-Cuban dance. And he was along here with a, a, a young lady by the name of [HistoryMaker] Darlene Blackburn, and they all kind of danced together. And again, we're talking about the early '60s [1960s] when this was, everybody was grooving with the afros and you know, the big earrings and getting back to their roots and stuff. So Joseph was all about that, but he decided that he wanted a little bit more and would move to New York [New York] for a while. He went there, studied at not only the Ailey school [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater] but Dance Theatre of Harlem [New York, New York] also under [HistoryMaker] Arthur Mitchell and of course, under, under, Alvin Ailey and all the teachers that he had at the, at the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater school [New York, New York]. So Joseph was there, but Joseph always wanted to start his own company, didn't just want to be a dancer. He wanted to be a choreographer who was in charge of his own company. He always knew he was gonna come back here to Chicago, but he needed to get the real stuff, and he felt that was in New York from Martha Graham, from Dance Theatre of Harlem, from the Alvin Ailey. So he just immersed himself in the training there and decided that at that point, you know, when he thought it was right, which was several years later, he would come back to Chicago and start his own company. And so he did, but this time he wanted a modern company very similar to Alvin Ailey.
Speaker 1: So what, what year are we speaking of right now when he decided to come back (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We're talking, when he, when he decided to come back, it was I, I believe like in '70 [1970], '72 [1972]. I didn't meet him 'til '74 [1974], and he had come back to, to Chicago and to start his own, his own company. And he started this company with people who just had the enthusiasm to dance and want to be there. And you know, a lot of them didn't have a whole lot of technique, but they had the enthusiasm, and they had the presence. They could perform, but he wanted them taking class every day, both ballet and modern. And so he started this company, started training them first, 'cause he wanted to get the Graham. The Joseph Holmes Chicago Dance Theatre was based in Martha Graham technique, and he wanted them to, to get that. And the only way of getting that done was by him teaching it, so that's what he did. And before we, before he started dancing in the auditoriums, he wanted to make sure that he had a dance company that was ready to go on the stage. So mind you, these were dancers who had regular eight-hour jobs. So they'd come in in the evening to, to rehearse and to take class and, and everything, so we were there until 10:30, 11:00 at night. But these were people who had passion.
Speaker 1: And dedication.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, and dedication, yes, yes for this. So, that, that's what they, what they did. So they were nurse; they were teachers; they were doctors; they were--yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: What number? What approximately was the size of the dance (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) How any dancers?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, he had a, a company of, I, I would say, about sixteen dancers, sixteen people who were interested in dancing with them at first. And then, when I took over, we went down to, to, to twelve because I wanted full-time people, as opposed to the folks who had those other jobs. This was going to be their job. So that's really what happened, yeah. And it all seemed to work. But when Harriet Ross came in, she saw the enthusiasm there; she saw the dedication there. She just did not see the, the technique as it could be and that it eventually would be. So she worked us. I mean she worked us. She made a lot of the women lose the weight that they had the extra pounds that they were carrying and let us know what a real plie was and a tendu. And it, it was just incredible. This woman was actually, she didn't care whether people liked her or not. She was there for a job. I mean she was there to work us, you know, and she did it all gratis because she saw the dedication. She knew that there was talent in this group, so she just went for it. She was paying us to be there (laughter), you know, just amazing, absolutely amazing.
Story_ID: 394680
Speaker 1: Right now this is during the period of 1975--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: When Harriet Ross became involved in the Joseph Holmes Dance [Joseph Holmes Chicago Dance Theatre]. Tell me more about her influence and her representation.
Speaker 2: Well, Harriet Ross, who, again, was a graduate of the High School of Performing Arts [Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts, New York, New York] and Juilliard [The Juilliard School, New York, New York] and a student of, of Graham [Martha Graham] and Graham technique, which is the modern dance technique that I spoke of earlier, came to Chicago [Illinois] with her husband, Irwin Ross, who was a financial man, of course, working at the Mercantile Exchange [Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Chicago, Illinois], and moved here knowing that she wanted to be involved. And then she did not want to stop that because she came from New York [New York]. So she was actually looking for a company to work with or someplace she could fit in. And Joseph [Joseph Holmes] had found her and asked her to come over to teach a, a master class or a workshop, which she did. He fell in love with her because he was just a slave to Graham technique, to Martha Graham technique. And Harriet was everything that Graham stood for. So, here she comes, this very, very influential woman who is like 5'3", maybe 5'4" (laughter), very, very--if, if, if she's, if she's--she could be just 5 feet. I'm not exactly sure. But anyway, I always see her in heels. She wears heels to, to make sure that she looks (laughter) she's a bit taller than she is. But she is an incredible influence in, in dance and especially here in Chicago. But back then we didn't know who she was. She was just this woman with this very heavy New York accent from Brooklyn [New York]. And we (laughter), we were somewhat annoyed at, at her coming in and trying to change us, 'cause we all thought we were so hot to trot; we were so good. And here this woman is, "No, no, no, that's not right, not, nat, nat, yat, yat, yat, yat, yat, yat, you know, your hand not right, you're feet aren't pointed, blah-da, datta, datta, datta." She stayed on us like white on rice. And (laughter) I was like, "Oh, my God, this woman is really evil (laughter)," had nothing to do with our person, nothing to do with our personality, had everything to do with our dance. And so we began to, to ac- accept her after she let us know she wasn't going anywhere; she was not going anywhere. Joseph Holmes wasn't paying her to, to be there. She was doing it as an honor. She knew that she could get this company into the shape it needed to be, to be an international company, looking dancing company. So, talk about heavy influence, this woman had great influence in this company. She's the one that really turned this company around and made it look like the, the company it, it was looking during that day.
Story_ID: 394681
Speaker 1: I was there from '7- from actually '74 [1974] all the way to 1993, which is when I decided to leave the company [Joseph Holmes Chicago Dance Theatre]. I was there for twelve years just as a dancer and then seven years as a dancer/artistic director. And then I just had enough of all the, the politics and things you have to play at the board level and all that, had nothing to do with the artistic part, and then had everything to do with the artistic part. The artistic part was going just fine, but I, I just--you know, it was just such a headache, and so I had to let it go and become a, a freelance choreographer. But back during that time I was just this little guy, you know, a little dancer, the youngest one in the company, who was from the, the ABLA projects, the ABLA Homes [Chicago, Illinois], or some people would know it to be like the Cabrini-Green [Cabrini-Green Homes, Chicago, Illinois]. You know, that's the one that's most well-known here in Chicago [Illinois]. And then there's, of course, there's the Ida B. Wells Homes on Chica- Chicago's South Side. But the ABLA Homes was on the West Side of Chicago, growing up in the projects with my, you know, brothers and sisters. And, and this is also where Medill [Joseph Medill Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] was, where I went from fifth grade to, to eighth and graduated. So, here I was with my little young black self from the projects in this dance company that was pretty soon to become a world-class company. You know, but I was there just having fun (laughter), you know. That was, that was it. I would learn every potty- everybody's parts, all the boys', all the girls' parts, didn't matter. I just was full of energy and ready to go. And before you know it, in 1986, the, the, well, ac- actually, the company was doing quite well touring locally. We were doing the universities. We were doing churches, church basements. We were doing anywhere we could go and perform; that's where we would go, whether it was a, a, a fair at St. Louis [Missouri], in St. Louis or something, we'd go, you know. And then we got this wonderful grant from CBS, which was a grant called the Chance to Dance grant. And I think it was like, was it seven hundred thousand dollars or something like that? It was a lot of money; I, I do remember that.  And this is when Joseph [Joseph Holmes] was alive. And this is what started the ball to rolling as far as getting rid of a lot of the people, a lot of the dancers who had those regular eight-hour jobs and wanting people to become full time. And that's really, really what happened, and that started the ball to rolling. And Joseph was only able to do it for so long, and then he died in '86 [1986], and that's when I took over the company. So, I can't tell you exactly what year it was. I don't remember, when we had the Chance to Dance grant, at the moment, but you know. But it was a huge, huge ordeal. And it only allowed ten dancers out of the sixteen or so that we had to be on salary and a very minimal wage of like ten thousand dollars a year. And, but we were able to do it, you know. Most of us were, were young, and we didn't have those jobs, those other jobs that the other folks had. And when you wanted to use the people, they would come in in the, later in the afternoon and work with us all the way through the evening. So we were there from morning until 10:30, 11:00 at night rehearsing and, and performing when you go out to the various schools. And basically, the Chance to Dance program was to get those inner city kids involved in dance, bring them back to the school, and the CBS grant would take care of their, their transportation, their leotards and tights. And it was quite an extraordinary position to be in. And we were the only one here in the city or eve- even around the country that had such a program going on.
Speaker 2: How fascinating (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And we got a lot of professional dancers through that program.
Speaker 2: And at one point you said that you left the Joseph Holmes Dance company, and then you came back.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I, I left Joseph Holmes when I went to school, to Illinois State University [Normal, Illinois].
Speaker 2: But then you said after a period, you came back and you worked with Joseph Holmes, and then you left again.
Speaker 1: No, no, no, no, I, I didn't. After, after I came back from, from college I stayed with Joseph Holmes the whole time, yeah. The whole--
Speaker 2: Because--
Speaker 1: --time I stayed.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 394682
Speaker 1: Okay, let's speak more about that seven-year period, from 1986 to 1993, when you took over--
Speaker 2: Joseph Holmes Chicago Dance Theatre (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 2: Well, let me start from the beginning when, when--how I came into the position of artistic director of Joseph Holmes. Joseph [Joseph Holmes] had actually left his deathbed wish, literally his deathbed wish was that the company stayed together, that a concert would be done in the spring, and that, or in the fall I believe, and that I would be left in charge of the company. He had asked that of the executive director. So the executive director goes to the board and says, "Joseph Holmes has said that he wants [HistoryMaker] Randy Duncan to take over the company." Now mind you, prior to this, Joseph and I had collaborated on a, on a piece where he had allowed me to choreograph for the company on a few occasions. And then we actually collaborated on a piece called 'Aretha,' which was a, a suite of Aretha Franklin's songs, which was a hit everywhere we went. So there was, there was that, and that was done in 1983. And so we--
Speaker 1: What were some of these, these songs of hers that was--
Speaker 2: Oh, some of the songs was: 'Think,' 'Respect,' 'Try A Little Tenderness,' 'Say a Little Prayer for You' ['I Say a Little Prayer'], I mean just on and on (laughter), on and on people would readily recognize these, these songs. You know, it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How long was that piece?
Speaker 2: It was a thirty minute piece, thirty minute suite, thirty-five minute suite, I should say, yeah. It was absolutely wonderful. So, he had left, his wishes were, was that I would take over the company. So the executive director went to the board and said, I was already interim director while he was in the hospital. They, he said that he did not want the company to close. He wanted Randy to take over, and everybody agreed unanimously that I would do that. And then I agreed that I would (laughter) do it. I was twenty-eight years old. And I said, "Okay, all right, so what are we gonna do here?" First off, I wanted to get rid of some people that I felt we were just carrying the weight, and they know, know, they, they no longer--although they were wonderful, wonderful people and talented folks, but they had their other jobs, and I just felt that the company really, really needs to be here full time, absolutely full time. We don't need to be here 'til 10:30 at night. We can do it just like all the other companies, be here from, you know, 10:00 in the morning until 6:00 at night, just and be done, as far as our rehearsals and things were concerned. So there was a schedule that I had to, to take care of, and there were people that, you know, I had to, to release from, from the company and also get some new blood in there as well. So I had auditions for other, other folk. Those folks that I had gotten rid of, I needed to, to replace, so, so we were doing that as well.
Story_ID: 394683
Speaker 1: This was at, also at a time when the company was getting ready to take off in its first European tour, and I needed to get a, a program together for that. So actually, it wasn't the first European tour with the, the, the first tour we took that was kind of outside, you know, across the water somewhere was Hawaii (laughter). So the company actually went to Hawaii for three weeks and, and performed at various universities and auditoriums that they did, that they had there. So that was one of the first things that, that we did, and came back, did a full concert of which Oprah Winfrey, when she came here for ABC [sic.] (laughter), when she came here for 'The Today Show' ['Today'], one of the opportunities that she thought would be good was to host the Joseph Holmes Dance Theatre [Joseph Holmes Chicago Dance Theatre] in a, in an event for a fundraiser. So, she hosted the event. And this was prior to Joseph's [Joseph Holmes] death first. And then after that, she did another event for us in which I was the artistic director. And this is when we had our performance at the Auditorium Theatre [Chicago, Illinois]. And she was just so impressed, yes, really, really impressed with the company. So, there is, there is that connection as well. And before you know it, the critics started coming out to see the company when I was there, 'cause everybody wanted to know, "Okay, now that Joseph is gone, what is this company gonna look like under [HistoryMaker] Randy Duncan's direction?" Now they had seen some of my choreography, some of my own choreography on the company, in which they really enjoyed. And then so everybody was coming out for this first concert after Joseph's death at the Auditorium Theatre. There were concerts before that and in between that time. And on the night of Joseph's death, actually, we had a, a, a performance in a really big, College of DuPage [Glen Ellyn, Illinois], which was just tremendously sad. Nobody knew but me at that time. I wouldn't tell the dancers until the end of the performance. But I had to keep it to myself 'cause I didn't want anybody, you know, falling out on stage (laughter) at all. But, but anyway, everything just started rolling from that, that day forward, and we started getting more funding. The critics had come out to see the performances and thought, "Wow, this guy has got something here." And I got some really, really good press, very, very good reviews, glowing reviews as a matter of fact. And folks said, "I want to buy into his dream." And so that's really what started happening. So we started our European tour. We went to France.
Story_ID: 394684
Speaker 1: Well other than the, the, the, the separation of the sixteen going, changing to twelve numbers [in the Joseph Holmes Chicago Dance Theatre], what other techniques or how different were you than (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Than Joseph [Joseph Holmes]?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Joseph was actually more modern, as far as modern dance is concerned, a little bit slower in his approach to movement than I am. I'm a little bit faster with myself and a, a little more jazzier, a little bit more sassy, you know, from my training in, in acrobatics and of course in ballet, in modern, and in jazz. It just, and, and also having seen other choreographers that have worked with, with, with Alvin Ailey, like Ulysses Dove and, and others that he's used before, watching what they do, being influenced by, by their style and all. I have, I have my own style, but it was looking at those, those different kinds of styles that really kind of influenced what, what I did with my own work, as well as Joseph, you know. So, that, there was a huge difference in between what we did. When, people knew when they saw Randy's [HistoryMaker Randy Duncan] stuff that it was gonna be faster than Joseph's, for instance, you know. He was gonna have more turns, you know. He was gonna have them leap. He's gonna have them, you know, all these lifts and things, whereas Joseph was more closer to the earth and stayed, you know, much more dramatic with his work, a lot more like Martha Graham would do. That was (unclear), and Joseph was into big storytelling. He liked to stel- tell big tales, and so that's what he did with his work. Mine was a bit slicker, more commercial, audience accessible, to get right to the heart of the matter instead of, you know, going and keeping people in suspense and long and drawn out. I can do that too, but, but Joseph was doing it, so I said why, I don't want to go that route. I don't want people to think I'm, I'm Joseph, so I, I chose to, to do some other things. And that's really the difference between us. You know, Joseph didn't have a, he didn't have a vo- vocabulary in acrobatics. You know, he didn't really have a strong vocabulary in jazz. Most of his was in ballet and modern, and mine was in all of that, and in African dance, Joseph also.

Speaker 1: So what role did Harriet Ross play during the time that your transformation of the, the company [Joseph Holmes Chicago Dance Theatre] occurred (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Artistic director leader.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Well, Harriet Ross was the, the, became the associate artistic director of the company. So it was more like an assistant to Joseph Holmes and then consequently become, becoming my assistant, who's not only teaching classes but also helping to get funds for the company, going out to the various meetings. She was also on the board of directors along with her husband [Irwin Ross]. So she, she was a great influence and great, great support for this company, I mean like leading support of this company, 'cause she knew people with, with, with the funds who could make it happen, who made sure that the company stayed, stayed employed, that all the dancers stayed employed while they were under my, under my guide, yeah.
Speaker 1: And you said that after your taking over the company, allowed you more international exposure as well as--
Speaker 2: After I took over the company, there, you know, they have what are known as showcases where dance companies go in. And these are all the companies, you know, Alvin Ailey [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater], Dance Theatre of Harlem, Joffrey Ballet, River North [River North Dance Chicago], Hubbard Street [Hubbard Street Dance Chicago], you know, all these people. There is a convention that happens in which you can go and show presenters from various theaters, universities, colleges, you know, that are interested in having entertainment at their places, at their, their venues. And so, we would go to these conventions. And we had a, what do you call, an agent, who would go out and say, "You should look at the Joseph Holmes company." And so these conventions included folks from the, from the European countries as well as the United States. And they had seen our company, and they loved the fact that it was an interracial company, or a mixed company, I should say. And so, they were like, this should really be cool. Therefore, we got to go to England and to France and to Israel at, you know. And this would be like our first time doing this and then a repeated tour of these places as well. And this only happened after I took over the company. And the company became more refined and more, how would you say it, world, world classy, if you will (laughter). So, that's what happened after I had taken over the company, but thanks, in, in part, to Harriet Ross too.
Story_ID: 394686
Speaker 1: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So after seven years, you decided, of course, as you mention, that being more independent and not having the company would be your--
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, after being there for seven years and wanting more, I really, really wanted more dancers in the company. I wanted the company to, to travel more. And at this time, back in the early '90s [1990s], it, there was a huge problem happening with, far as finances were concerned, with many of the companies, many corporate companies. They were bellying up because there was this big crash in the market. I don't know if you remember that, but there was a huge crash in the market, and a lot of our funding sources were being depleted. So it was very, very tough. And a lot of the board members were thinking, "Uh, I don't know what you're gonna do, Randy [HistoryMaker Randy Duncan]. We might have to cut down." We on, we only had twelve dancers at this, at this point, and they wanted to cut it down to ten. And I just said, "We're not even where I want to be, and there's no way I want to do this." And so--
Speaker 2: And this is in the early 1980s?
Speaker 1: This, no, this is in the, this is in the '90s [1990s].
Speaker 2: We're getting further on.
Speaker 1: This is, right, right. And I think the, the, the crash, was it in '91 [1991] or '92 [1992] that it happened? I can't really remember, but it was back in that time that there was this huge crash. And, and I said, "Well, you know, if you guys are not gonna fight for this and for me having the kind of company that I want, I cannot see staying here as the artistic director, leading this company as its director, and just settling for something." So, I decided I was gonna go and do my own thing. At which time, Harriet [Harriet Ross] had already left because she was tired of the noise a year prior (laughter). And so she said, "Well, Randy, if you leave, I'd be happy to, to manage you." And she's been doing it ever since, yeah, since I left the company. And so immediately upon leaving the company, I had no idea what I was gonna do. I thought I was gonna go back to do musical theater, because I had my equity card [Actors' Equity Association], my, as it were, and I could go back on stage if I needed to. I just didn't want to do concert work, as far as the dance was concerned. But I started getting phone calls from everybody, and the first call was from the Joffrey Ballet while they were still in New York [New York]. And Jerry Arpino [Gerald Arpino], who's the artistic director, asked me if I would come out to set a work on his company, the Joffrey Ballet. And well, hello, of course (laughter), of course, I'd be, I'd be honored to do it. So I came out to New York and was there for three weeks and created this ballet called 'A Tri-Fling' [Randy Duncan], T-R-I, hyphen, F-L-I-N-G, which gained incredible press from The New York Times as well as here in Chicago [Illinois] with the Chicago Tribune and all. It was a major success. Two years later, they moved to Chicago. I would love to say it's because of me, but (laughter), they, they were looking for a place to, to move to, so they moved to Chicago. And every year after that for five years, I put a piece on their company, on the Joffrey Ballet. But then there was also (cough) excuse me, The Chicago Academy for the Arts [Chicago, Illinois] had called and to see if I would be interested in being on staff there. And that is the high school of performing arts here in Chicago, which is a private, a private school. And so I said yes, and I've been teaching there ever since. But also, there was River North Dance company [River North Dance Chicago] that's here in Chicago that I set a work on. And then Gus Giordano jazz [Giordano Dance Chicago] here in Chicago also put a work on. So now that I'm no longer with Joseph Holmes [Joseph Holmes Chicago Dance Theatre], everybody wants me to come and put a work, bring a work to their repertoire, which is, which is great. So, that's really what I've been doing ever since, yeah.
Speaker 2: What happened to the--
Speaker 1: The company, Joseph Holmes (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The company, yeah, after you left?
Speaker 1: In, I left in 1993. The company existed for another year and a half under the direction of Kevin Iega Jeff, who had come from New York. And he had since started his own company, but he was brought in as the artistic director of that company. And most of the dancers decided that, you know, they did not want to be under the guise of anybody else. So they just left and went their separate ray- ways. Some people stayed with them for a moment, and then they left. But then he decided, you know, I think I'm gonna just start fresh and start my own company, and now he has a company called Deeply Rooted [Deeply Rooted Dance Theater] here in Chicago, yeah, which is a very nice company, but no longer the Joseph Holmes Dance Theatre, just kind of dissipated.
Story_ID: 394687
Speaker 1: Well, tell me more about this 'Tri-Fling' ['A Tri-Fling,' Randy Duncan] that you wrote (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Ah, the 'Tri-Fling'?
Speaker 1: Yeah, and how that was inspired.
Speaker 2: That, that particular piece is, actually is a pas de trois, which is a, a dance for three. And it is a piece I, when I was going to put this on the company, I knew that I needed to do a pointe work, meaning that the girl would have to be on pointe shoes. And this would be my first time choreographing a ballet on pointe, other than doing something for the, for our outreach program on our own dancers. And we had girls in the company that could do pointe work. So I choreographed something for them to, to show the kids this is what dance looks like on, in, with they would call toe shoes, you know. So I've knew that it would be that, so that would be a challenge, and I love challenges. So I knew that that would be a challenge. We're talking about the world-famous Joffrey Ballet. And he [Gerald Arpino] was gonna allow me several people to work with, but he wanted a small piece. And so this piece is about nine minutes long. And I decided I would use two guys and one girl. And the girl would have to choose between a man who would be considered or looked as if it was her husband and the guy that she was having an affair with outside of the marriage. And so I made this little story up, and it was very successful, yeah, very, very successful.
Speaker 1: 'Tri-Fling.'
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah, so it's called 'A Tri-Fling.'
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 394688
Speaker 1: And so after you left New York [New York] to come back to Chicago [Illinois], how long were you here in Chicago before the, the Joffrey Ballet company actually moved here?
Speaker 2: When I came back to Chic- after working with the Joffrey for the few weeks I was there and came back here, the Joffrey was looking for a new residence, and Chicago was one of the places they were thinking. They were also thinking of L.A. [Los Angeles, California] or San Francisco [California] or something. But Chicago seemed to be the home, because we, we really didn't have a ballet company here at the time that was working out to most people's satisfaction. I mean, we had Chicago Ballet [sic. Ballet Chicago] for a while with Maria Tallchief, and then she left. And then Danny Duell [Daniel Duell] took over, who was from New York City Ballet. And somehow things just weren't working out to, to the expectations of people. But because Joffrey was already well-known, it was very easy for people to say, "Okay, we're gonna put our money towards Joffrey if they come here." And that's basically what's, what's been happening. And not that Joffrey wanted to, at, in any way move anybody else from the scene. They were just coming, coming here, which they did very quietly. And he works doing the outreach programs as well. He would perform at the outside or whatever. Just people know that, you know, I want to be part of this community. So he [Gerald Arpino] came in in a very, very humble way, as if they were just a new, fresh company, like, you know, like they were not known at all. And they just came on in, and, and people in Chicago absolutely loved them, and they're doing quite well here now. But it was two years later, '95 [1995], that they came here.
Story_ID: 394689
Speaker 1: Were there any other pieces that you chora- choreographed (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Choreographed for them?
Speaker 1: --for, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's, oh, my goodness, there are four other pieces that they have in their rep [repertoire] of mine. One is called the 'Initiation' [Randy Duncan], which is a dance for men. And another one is--
Speaker 1: How, how was 'Initiation' inspired?
Speaker 2: Well, 'Initiation' I had first done on the Joseph Holmes Dance company [Joseph Holmes Chicago Dance Theatre], so my own company, well, my own company, company had taken, taken over. It was a, it, it was actually a piece from, from there. And that is a piece that deals with men wanting to belong to a club or a fraternity in a very, and it's done in a very, how can I put this? There's strong African influence in that piece. So these ballet dancers literally had to do contractions and releases of their backs and bodies that normally they wouldn't do. So it was something fresh, and the Joffrey [Joffrey Ballet] is always opened to fresh and new and contemporary ideas. So this was very different for them. And it had a few little acrobatic tricks in there as well, really, really strong and very, very powerful piece that they had to do with no shoes on; yeah, this is done with bare feet. And you know ballet dancers don't necessarily like to go bare (laughter), barefooted. Modern dance is completely different. But, yeah, yeah, and they took to it like, like duck to water, you know, yeah. So, it was really good, really, really good. And I said duck to water. It should be fish to water, shouldn't it? Yeah, I think so (laughter).
Speaker 1: Almost the same.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, ducks, they, does go in; they're okay. And then there's another piece called 'Copland Motets' [Randy Duncan], which is also a piece that I did at Joseph Holmes, which is to music that is of Aaron Copland's, when he was a student in, at university. So this was music, it's all a cappella music, singing. And these are, there's three dancers that are dancing, and it's called 'Copland Motets.'
Speaker 1: And type movement do you incorporate (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The, the--
Speaker 1: --in that?
Speaker 2: --movement there is, is very lyrical. The style is very linear. There is, it's a, it's a trio. It's a, again, two guys and, and one girl that's involved, but it can go way, either way. It can be three guys; it can be three girls, doesn't matter. It's one that doesn't, doesn't cause you to be male or female. It's really, really a very fascinating piece and just kind of strong and, and beautiful, making beautiful portraits and all. And when we do it, it's usually done to live musicians, so live vocalists on stage, yeah, very, very nice. And then there's another piece. Let's see, that's three there, 'Affection' [Randy Duncan]. It's, and, and this is the full company piece. And it's about a twenty, twenty minute long thing. And it has to do with couples being in love with each other, and how it is to be young and to be vibrate, and all that first stuff in love. And, and then it also shows some heartbreak and tension within the relationship, as we some, somehow, sometimes have. You, you go away, and you come back together. You go away; you come back together, like my mom [Betty Mason Boglin (ph.)] and dad [Ernest Duncan] did (laughter), so, for a while there. But, but there is that, and that's also a pointe piece. That's, the girls are in pointe shoes. And that consisted, I think we had like sixteen dancers, yeah, for that, for that particular piece and with original music by this guy, Kimo Williams, who was on faculty at the Columbia College [Columbia College Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], so, an extraordinary talent. So there's, there's that, and that's call the 'Affection.' And what else? Let's see, that's 'Initiation,' 'Tri-Fling' ['A Tri-Fling,' Randy Duncan], 'Affection,' 'Copland Motets,' and there's one more that, that's in the Joffrey, oh, 'Kay's Lilt' [Randy Duncan], (laughter) that's it.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: Kay's, K--K-A-Y, and then apostrophe S, Lilt, L-I-L-T. And this piece was commissioned by the Wolf Trap theater in Washington, D.C. [sic. Vienna, Virginia]. They commissioned me to do a work for the Joffrey that would honor the memory of Kathleen Shouse [sic. Catherine Filene Shouse], who was a, a funder of, of the Wolf Trap organization, the Wolf Trap Foundation [Wolf Trap Foundation for the Performing Arts]. And so I did this piece of angels, I mean if you will. That's basically what it's like, and to the music of 'Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me.' I can't even remember who the, the composer [Elton John] is, but anyway, and it's a very well-known composer. I can't think of his name right now, but it'll come to me. But anyway, it's a, it's a, it's a beautiful piece. And there's like these angels that come from heaven and takes care of this, this woman. So that's what that's, that is about.
Story_ID: 394690
Speaker 1: Talking about the 'Kay's Lilt' [Randy Duncan], the piece that I did. The music is actually by Elton John, 'Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me.' I just, just recalled that, so yes, thanks to one of our trusty crew members over here (laughter), yeah.
Speaker 2: So basically, during this period of your life, you were independent, and you were doing choreography for different dance companies and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) For different dance companies. Yeah, during the--after I left the Joseph Holmes Dance Theatre [Joseph Holmes Chicago Dance Theatre] in '93 [1993], my first job was with Joffrey Ballet. And I, each, each year after that I started choreographing or was commissioned to do pieces for the company, whether they were pieces of mine that I had done before or they were new pieces. That's what I was doing, and for five straight years I did that with, with Joffrey as well as with companies like River North Dance Chicago, Gus Giordano Dance Chicago here, Bat-Dor Dance Theatre [Bat-Dor Dance Company] in Israel in Tel Aviv, the Tennessee Children's Dance Ensemble in Tennessee. Gosh, there is just so many. And so, between that time and now, I have actually been choreographing for various things; not only that, but also theater, doing work for, for professional theater as well, yeah.
Story_ID: 394691
Speaker 1: And in all of this, who was one the, your most major influences or people that inspired you into the, the different forms of dance, modern dance, jazz dance, and everything that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I, I knew that was gonna come up at some point. Well, I, I would say as, as far as inspiration is concerned for as far as choreography and style of movement and all, there were choreographers: Alvin Ailey, of course; also Ulysses Dove, who used to be a dancer of Alvin Ailey's, and, and subsequently became a, a choreographer for, for his, did absolutely marvelous work there [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater]; Joseph Holmes as well. So, I would say those particular individuals have really influenced me as far as that's concerned. There are some who influenced me in, in an off kind of way like Twyla Tharp, you know, for instance, and [HistoryMaker] Arthur Mitchell, you know. These are folks who I would also look at to see what they were doing and, and was influenced to some extent by them, [HistoryMaker] Bill T. Jones. Yeah, they, they all have something to look at and to gain from, and, and that's kind of what, when I'm going out to look at, at what people are doing, you know, I, I see some things. And it, it could be something as simple as the subject matter that they were working with. You know, it doesn't necessarily have to even be the, the style in which they were using, but it was the subject matter that helped me to open my own eyes and see that there is some other stuff to work with.
Story_ID: 394692
Speaker 1: Your experiences in Tel Aviv [Israel], how does that come about?
Speaker 2: Well, the company went to, the Joseph Holmes dance company [Joseph Holmes Chicago Dance Theatre] went to Israel in 1991. And we were the first arts group to come to the, to the region after the Gulf War. And we went there with this program that included 'Aretha,' the, the piece that I spoke of before that Joseph Holmes and I had put together. And the crowds went wild, I mean wild, so wild you thought we were rock stars. They were rushing the stage. Now, mind you, in Israel, this is after the Gulf War, and we're thinking people rushing the stage, we don't know what they gonna do, whether there's something attached to them (laughter) or what. But, but it was absolutely amazing, and we were like the stars of Israel. They were scalping tickets in front of the theater. Every single place we went was sold out completely. We were on every radio station, on every television station in Jerusalem, in Haifa [Israel], in Beersheba [Israel]. We performed in all those places and Caesarea [Israel]. You know, there was an amazing applause and energy that was there in Israel that, you know, even here, you know how, how we are here; we, we love what we love. But there, they won't stop clapping. They won't stop stomping. You have to come out and do several bows and come back with repeated stuff. They want a reprise of something. You, they won't let you off stage. So it was really, really quite fascinating to be treated that way and to know everybody wants you at their club in the evening afterwards. "Come over to our--," and people were calling, and they'd find out where we were going, so everybody would show up at, at the club (laughter), you know. It was so funny, moment we step in, they're playing Aretha Franklin's music. Yeah, so, it was, it was quite extraordinary, quite extraordinary. And I had to, I have to say that that was an eye-opening experience as well, to be with the Israelis. And to even perform on some of their bases was really quite fascinating, you know. They all carried guns and rifles there, you know (laughter), so, like, okay, you know, here we are in this, in this environment, how is this gonna be? But, they were great; they were absolutely incredible, really, I mean to be treated so wonderfully and, and then to meet the kings and queens of various places, folks I didn't even know, you know, 'cause what do we know over here in our country? We go over there and I don't know who I'm meeting, but I met a lot of dignitaries. I could not even tell you who they were, but they were from other countries as well, and just a wonderful experience.
Speaker 1: Though how does being in Israel compare to Europe or some of the other countries where your dance troupe (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, to compare to our European tour. The Israelis were, ah, my god, a lot more emotional. They, you know, it's like they wear their hearts on their sleeves, and you see it, you know. They'll let you know when they like something, and they'll let you know when they don't like something. And that's just in everyday ordinary life they, they will say these things. You know, everything is a directive. Nothing is, you know, please or may I or any of that. Those pleasantry, pleasantries are, they don't seem to exist there. But when they like something, they let you know they like it, and they really, they, they really loved, they fell in love with this company, absolutely fell in love. So after that I had to go back every year to teach 'cause they wanted some of what I had to bring them themselves. So the Bat-Dor Dance Company or dance theatre, they had a summer course every year, and I would be invited back to teach each year for the next seven or eight years I was going back to Israel to do that every summer. Compared to the, the European country there, they are, they're very good; they're very nice and polite, and they, they loved the, the company, standing ovations and all. But the, the reception at, in Israel was just completely different. It was just mind-boggling, just like, you know, the troops are coming, the troops. That's the way the hands would applaud and stomp on the feet, and stomp, and they wouldn't stop until you came back out. We had to come back out. I mean there's ten, fifteen minutes of applauding. It's just crazy.
Story_ID: 394693
Speaker 1: So after you began teaching there during the summer, where exactly were you teaching, and--
Speaker 2: I was in Tel Aviv [Israel] teaching. And every now and then I would go to Jerusalem to do a master class or workshop as well. But basically, it was all in Tel Aviv, which is a very cosmopolitan city and beautiful, right along the Mediterranean [Mediterranean Sea]. It was absolutely wonderful, it really was. And you didn't see all the strife that you see over here on television and hear about in the news. And you know, I take it that it's like hearing over there what happens in here just in our little neighborhoods with the gang warfare and all that. But there it's, you know, one person coming in and you know, blowing themself up just to get rid of a number of people, you know. So, so there was a, there, there's a huge difference when you're there versus when you're not and you're just listening to what, and they're only showing the bad parts as to what's happening, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you tour any other countries other than Europe and the Middle East?
Speaker 2: I've not yet, yes. But no, we didn't as, as a company, oh, Mexico, sorry (laughter); I'm so sorry. Yeah, Mexico is the other one, yes. Well, that's so close to us, you know, you think it's part of the United States. But yeah, Mexico we did do, which was also a wonderful opportunity and great reception from the Mexican people. And we, we were all over Mexico, you know, Mexico City [Mexico], Guadalajara [Mexico], Monterrey [Mexico], you know, all these various places, so it was really good, very, very good.
Story_ID: 394694
Speaker 1: Well, tell us something about your, your first major motion picture, 'Save the Last Dance' (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'Save the Last Dance,' wow, how did that come about? The, for 'Save the Last Dance' they were looking to do this movie that involved hip hop and ballet. And this would be the first time something like this has, has come into being. And so somebody wrote a, a story about this and decided that they wanted it to take place here in Chicago [Illinois], for financial reasons probably one it was a big thing as opposed to having it done in L.A. [Los Angeles, California]. So they moved everything here to Chicago. They had this actress, Julia Stiles, who they wanted to use because she was the big name then, as far as teenagers were concerned. Everybody was after '10 Things I Hate About You' and 'O' and all these other movies she had done at that time. All the teens were following her. She's on the cover of Sixteen magazine [sic. Seventeen magazine], et cetera. So, they called here. They had already had their hip hop choreographer from California, Fatima [Fatima Robinson], but they needed a, a ballet choreographer and teacher. So they called here to the Joffrey [Joffrey Ballet], and Harriet Ross, of course, answered. They said, "We hear, we heard about this guy, [HistoryMaker] Randy Duncan, who, who is there." And she said, "Well, yeah, you know, I manage Randy," and, "Well, we're looking to do this movie, and it incorporates hip hop dance and ballet. And we need someone to be able to, to create this image for us and working with this actress as well." And she says, "Well, well, I'll call him and let him know that you're looking for him (laughter)." So she calls me and says, "Paramount Pictures [Paramount Pictures Corporation] is looking (laughter) for you." I said, "What?" She said, "They'll be calling you shortly, so I'm just calling you to warn you about that." And so they called, and they said, "So you're the man that we're looking for. Can you come in for a meeting?" And I said, "Well, what is this about?" And they told me about the story. And I said, "Who is Julia Stiles?" I had no idea who she was. I had never seen '10 Things I Hate About You.' I, I saw the pictures and the publicity for it, but I'd never gone to see it. And they said, "Well, can you just come down for a meeting with the line producer?" And I said, "Okay, you know, I'll, I'll do this," and very, you know, nonchalantly went down the next day and had my meeting. And the, the, one of the producers said, "I'd like for you to meet the director. He's coming in tomorrow. Can you come back for another meeting?" So I went and met with the, with the director, Thomas Carter. And you know, he said, "Well, this is what we're looking for." And I said, "Yeah, you need somebody who can do, you know, the arms, ballet, blah, blah, blah, et cetera." He said, "Yeah, we'll have, we'll have some, some doubles, but we want her to do most of the work. And so we want her to do as much as she can, and we need to start filming in, in, in a month." (Laughter) And I was like, "What?" And I said, "Okay." So, I said, "Well, I need to see who this girl is." And he said, "Well, if you go get the movie, '10 Things I Hate About You,' you'll see her, and she does this little dance on the table at the very end." I said, "Well, she looks like she's got some rhythm and all," but I said, "still don't know whether she can really, you're talking about her doing ballet, which is very different than getting on top of somebody's table and moving around." And so I said, "I'll need her to come in." He said, "Okay, we'll fly her in."
Story_ID: 394695
Speaker 1: They flew her in the next day. I spent an hour with her, just seeing where she was in terms of her ballet training. And she really had none, but she was a very quick study. She had some classes as a kid, but you know, not much. 'Cause I asked her, I said, "Well, do you know what this posi- first, the first position that we do at the, at the bar?" She said, "Well, yeah." I said, "Good." Then I went to the next position. She--I said, "Do you know that?" She said, "Yeah." Then I when I went to the third one, she says, "I'm not sure, but if you showed me." Then I said, "Okay, I know where we are now." And so (laughter) we started, we started there, and she was wonderful to work with, absolutely wonderful to work with. Thomas Carter, after seeing the progress she'd made in two weeks, came into the studio, and he said, "Oh, my God, wow." He couldn't believe that this girl was--but she took to it like putty, you know. You, you just go and start working and, and then you come away with this wonderful, this wonderful art piece. And that's when she worked so, so hard, and we worked three hours every day for a month on just getting her ballet together. She still had to do the hip hop stuff, but she was pretty good in hip hop. That wasn't a problem. But then we had to choreograph. After making her take class, and then I sent her in with the kids at The Chicago Academy for the Arts [Chicago, Illinois], which is where I teach as well, and had her take class with them. Oh, they were very happy to see, "Oh, Julia Stiles, autograph, autograph," but she was there to work. And, and she blended in. And she was only seventeen at the time, so--
Speaker 2: Amazing.
Speaker 1: --she was just like one of them. Yeah, it was great; it was really, really great, yeah. And so that's how that all came about. They were looking for me 'cause they had heard about this [HistoryMaker] Randy Duncan, you know, (laughter) yeah, and that he was both a teacher and a choreographer, and, and that he could, he could do this.
Story_ID: 394696
Speaker 1: And I do, I love, I love teaching, and I love choreographing, and they are two separate things. Not every teacher is a choreographer (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --and not every choreographer is a teacher; they're completely different. And sometimes you do come by one who can do them both, and I happen to be one of those.
Speaker 2: And your, your choreography began when you--
Speaker 1: When I was with Joseph Holmes [Joseph Holmes Chicago Dance Theatre].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: In 1979 I started choreographing at Joseph Holmes, yeah.
Speaker 2: How difficult was that leap from becoming a dancer to, to becoming a choreographer?
Speaker 1: I have to say that if, if it's in you, it's there. It's not a leap; it's just there. You just have to recognize it and go with it. I started by teaching classes and noticed that all the combinations were coming very, very clearly and very fast without having to write anything down from the night before. And they would just come out organically. And that's when I knew, "Oh, hey, I don't need a cheat sheet; I can just go ahead and do this, and it comes out." And the things just come to me just like a writer or composer; they just come. And you know, if it's, if it's there, it's there. If it's not, then it takes a while to leap (laughter) from dancer to choreographer, and some of them never really make that. But, but that's really how it, how it comes about. It's, it's not a hard thing for me, yeah.
Speaker 2: And you said now there are those that teach dance and those that, that are able to both teach and choreograph dance.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And how would one, how would a teacher involve him or herself in becoming a choreographer, by practice or by, so how would that--
Speaker 1: Usually, like, at, at the, at The Chicago Academy for the Arts [Chicago, Illinois] we have these kids we give composition classes to, which are choreography classes showing them variations that they can use on a theme, how you want people to go, you know, stage left, stage right, down stage, up stage, if you will, working from one idea, whether it's a person sitting in a chair and thinking about, you know, his or her spouse and how they went off to work today, and then going to deal with that in terms of movement. You, you know, you just give them these various ways of, of getting into moving or coming, coming about movement. But every teacher, like I said, is not gonna become a choreographer. They can teach a nice class in terms of technique, in terms of structure, how your body needs to be, but in terms of composing, that's really what a choreographer is; he composes. And like, not every pianist, might be a great pianist, but they can't compose music. You know, it's the same thing, you know, in terms of dance.
Story_ID: 394697
Speaker 1: At The Chicago Academy for the Arts [Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you've been there since 19--
Speaker 2: I've been at Chicago Academy for the Arts since 1993.
Speaker 1: Are there any other pieces that you have composed or that you have choreographed that stand out as well as the five that you mentioned--
Speaker 2: At the--oh, my God (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) for the Joffrey [Joffrey Ballet]--
Speaker 2: Yes (laughter).
Speaker 1: Could you talk about one of the, some of the, your prominent pieces that, that--
Speaker 2: Well, one of the--
Speaker 1: --and why, and who inspired your, your--
Speaker 2: Well, one of the most prominent pieces right now I just choreographed last year is a, a solo called 'Ida' ['Ida/A Day in the Life of Ida B. Wells,' Randy Duncan]. And it is actually a piece based on the life of Ida, well, a day in the life of Ida B. Wells, who was, many of us know to be an activist in the early 1900s, late 1800s, early 1900s, who spoke against lynchings in the, in the South. She was a black woman, who was also a journalist, and moved here to, to Chicago [Illinois] in the early 1900s and stayed here 'til, I believe 1931 is when she, when she died, but spoke heavily against certainly racism, but, but lynchings in par- in particular, that were happening all over the South. So, this, this piece is based on her, her life. And it's really profound and big, and we're trying to get it produced so it can go on television somewhere right now. But it's really, really strong and powerful. And there's a dancer that I've used for several years, Sarita Smith Childs, who is the, the dancer that this piece was choreographed on. And right now I'm actually putting it on two of the dancers at The Chicago Academy for the Arts, two the black advanced dancers there who are absolutely wonderful and powerful, who will probably be leaving the academy and going, after they graduate this year, going straight into somebody's company, you know. So, that is, is one of the, one of my favorites at the moment. There's also (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And how long is Ida B. Wells piece, and what does it consist of?
Speaker 2: How long is it?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: The piece is actually eight minutes.
Speaker 1: So (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yes, eight minutes long, and like I said, it's a day in the life of her, not her entire life. That would take a little bit longer. But it is a, a dramatic piece, and it, the, the costume that she wears is as much a part of the dance as the movement that she's making. It is like in early 1900s dress that's very long with the petticoat, with the buttons all the way up to the collar. It's a dress that she probably would have worn to go to a meeting, you know, as a corporate woman back in, in that time, although there, there weren't many, you know. But this is the kind of thing, and it was like a, a dressy, casual/dressy-type costume that she's wearing. And she uses it to, to be a weapon. She uses it to be of comfort. She used it to be a child. There's all kinds of aspects of, of this costume that she's using. But like I said, it's a very, very dramatic piece. And the, the girl that does it, the dancer that does it, is, is a sensational dancer as well. It reminds you of, for those who have seen [HistoryMaker] Judith Jamison, (pronouncing) Judith Jamison, who is now the artistic director of Alvin Ailey [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater], it would remind you of something that she, she might be a part to, yeah.
Story_ID: 394698
Speaker 1: And what are some of your other prominent pieces that you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Works?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Gosh, there are so many (laughter).
Speaker 1: Of your ones that stand out--
Speaker 2: The ones that, that stand out?
Speaker 1: --in your life as significant?
Speaker 2: Many people love this piece I did for the Gus Giordano Jazz Dance Chicago [Gus Giordano Dance Chicago] called, was, it's now called Giordano Dance Jazz Chicago, called 'Can't Take This Away' [Randy Duncan].
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: Pardon me?
Speaker 1: What year would that have been?
Speaker 2: That was I think '99 [sic.], I believe, yeah, this is 2006--yeah, probably '99 [1999]. And I did that piece based on, and, and actually, not based on, but in memory of Gus Giordano's wife [Peg Giordano], who had, who had died that year, I believe. And I, I did that piece just in memory of her. And it's, it talks about, it speaks to, (unclear) full company work, which I think they have like ten dancers in their company. And it speaks to love and to, to loss, and to the love of life I mean, not the love of, you know, just an individual to individual, but the love of life, the spiritual connection between this person or people and the deity. So it's, it's got a lot to offer in that particular piece, yeah. And it's fun. It's lit- at the end there's like this whole chorus line of, of choir members that are, that are dancing. It's, it's really, really quite, quite wonderful and again, very profound. So that's one of the pieces that's, that's really very nice and that sticks out at the, at the moment. There's a new piece that I just choreographed called 'Journey' [Randy Duncan], which is a piece I choreographed for dancers here in Chicago [Illinois] from practically every dance company, Joffrey [Joffrey Ballet], River North [River North Dance Chicago], Gus Giordano, Hubbard Street [Hubbard Street Dance Chicago], Melissa Thodos and company [Thodos Dance Chicago]. We do a project every year where the proceeds goes to the AIDS Foundation [AIDS Foundation of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], and it's called Dance for Life. And that happens every summer here in Chicago in, in August. And it's just a one-night event where we raise as much money as possible by each of these dance companies coming out and doing a piece from their own rep [repertoire]. And then I will have taken a dancer or two from each of those companies. For two weeks I've worked with them to create a finale. So all of these dancers from various companies are working together. And they've never danced together before, and they all look like a company. And this last year is a pea- we did a piece called 'Journey,' which is very African in nature in terms of the style of the movement. The music is by a friend of mine, Doug Brush, who is a percussionist, who also is playing here for 'Wicked' ['Wicked: The Untold Story of the Witches of Oz,' Winnie Holzman], but someone I've, I've used quite extensively for accompaniment when I'm teaching master classes and workshops. And he composed the music for this, and the music is drums and cello. And yeah, amazing, it's amazing; it really is. And it just shows the struggles that people go through, and the help that they need from each other, and how much stronger they are when they are, when they are together as a unit versus when everybody is separate and doing their own thing. And that's what that piece is about, and it's called 'Journey.' Um-hm. Those are just a few, you know. There are others, but those (laughter) are the ones.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 394699
Speaker 1: Is there anything else you would like to add to your life that we haven't, that I haven't asked or that you haven't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That you haven't asked also?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: My gosh, it seems like we've covered so much in the, in this time. Not, not really at the moment. You know, I, I just, I love working with, with dancers who passion is only to dance. You know, they, nothing else gets in the way. There's a reason why they, God put them on this earth, and that is what it's for. It's really to move and to move people in the audience through their artistry. So that is something that I'd like folks to know. And if I can be a part of that, you know, then I'm very happy about it. But I'm, I'm thankful to God for allowing me the opportunity to showcase my own work and do it in such wonderful venues as we have in Israel, and in France, and in England, and everywhere else. So, I'm very grateful for that.
Story_ID: 394700
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In terms of interpretation, how do you interpret a story into dance and likewise, a dance into a story?
Speaker 2: How do I interpret a story into, into a dance? Well, first off, I have to know what the story is. For instance, 'Save the Last Dance,' if we want to go there, it's, it's very easy to know when, when somebody has a story, how to go from there. Okay, this is a story about the girl wanting to go to Juilliard [The Juilliard School, New York, New York] and don't really know quite how to get there. And then there's this guy who comes and helps her, in terms of her, her contemporary work, to, to, to get it. And so how do, how do we do this? We want something to be really fantastic for the judges to see, that they've never see before, hopefully. And so we, we go about making a piece that has all the tricks that you can possibly have and, and be strong and linear at the same time with that. Now when it comes to other stories like the, for instance, the 'Tri-Fling' ['A Tri-Fling,' Randy Duncan] and the, and the woman who is trying to treat- choose between the husband and this guy and how you make that, without any words, make that happen, you know, I, I set it up to where she's first with the, with the hus- with this guy who is seemingly her husband or at that time could be. You know, you don't know what he is. You know that she's some- he's something intimate with her because they start off hugging each other and holding each other in various positions so that you know that. But she's also very, how do you say it, very mundane with him. You know, this is what happens every day. This is kind of our regimen. This is what we go through, as if he goes off to work, you know, from there, so it, it shown in the movement. Yet, when she goes to see the guy she's having an affair with outside of the marriage, the movement is much more slinky and much more sexy, and the use of the hips is very different. And his come-on to her is also much, much different. The costume make a difference too because he has a costume that is more open. The, the, the top is, is open, and his pants are tight. And so you know he's so sort of, you know, boyfriend or could not quite be the husband there. Yet, the husband had a nice suit and tie on and getting ready for work. I'm going to bring, bring home the bacon, et cetera. And so it was like, "Yeah, yeah, honey, I'll see you later," that kind of thing. It was very, very polite. And then the other one is like really sensual and then so. So, it, that's, that's kind of the way you, you, you make it work. And as far as dance into, into story, I think it all kind of says the same thing. You know, it's, it's very hard to turn that around. But, but when a story is there, you can just break it up and say this is what I want. Now a lot of times when I'm choreographing concert work I have to make up my own story. It's not a story that says just do what you want. And for instance, I said I wanted three, I knew I wanted to do a pas de trois 'cause I like things in odd numbers, 'cause you always have to figure out what the other person has to do. You can figure it out with the two people, then there's that outside person. You've got to do something with it, and it doesn't have to necessarily be a sexual thing. It could be, you know, the person could be a tree or a frog or whatever, but you've got to figure out what you're gonna do with that third wheel, you know. And whether it's five, or seven, or nine, there's always somebody you've got to figure out, you know, so you can put them in triangles; you can go into fours, and then have, you know, two of it's at seven, have, have three off on the side, and then bring that in, break off one. I mean, so I, I look at those things when I'm choreographing as well, how we're gonna make these combinations work, which I guess is the reason why they talk about math and, and the, and dance going together, 'cause you, you really want to figure out these, these patterns and, and whatnot. So, that's really how I go about doing it. And then the lighting, the lighting does make a difference. I mean there are some things that you can see in fluorescent and be able to understand it, but it's so much better when you get, when you have a mood that's created for you. When you're sitting there at a bar, you know, you have a, a bar that is part of the set there. And the smoky, -the, the haze is coming through, and there's this blue light beaming down on you. And you have a cigarette in your hand, and you move in such a way that, that you you're sitting there waiting for somebody to come and talk to you. I mean it's just as simple as that. Movement can suggest this, and, and the atmosphere, can really, really suggest that this person is a lonely person. He may have just had a fight with his girlfriend, wife, you now, whatever, may have just lost a child, any of those things there. And then that's stop- the story will con- will continue to be told when the next person comes in, and you figure out what it's all about. And just the way and the shape and what he does with, with his body makes a difference as to how he's gonna communicate with the audience and tell you his story.
Story_ID: 394701
Speaker 1: What do you still want to do that you have not done in your life yet?
Speaker 2: That I have not done. I would love to create a full evening ballet, which means, now, that does not mean a, a full work is any work. A, a full work can be a minute or less if you want it to be, just like these commercials. You know what happens in thirty seconds, you know. But a full evening ballet, meaning that you're there for at least, you have a first act, second act, third act a lot of times, and then you have inter- intermission in between. But it's a full evening just like 'Swan Lake' [Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky], or 'Cinderella' [Sergei Prokofiev], or any of these other very well-known pieces. So that is something that I have not done that I am looking to do, yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: And what are the hopes and, is there anything that you have already done (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Done.
Speaker 1: --that you would like--
Speaker 2: To do again.
Speaker 1: --to have done differently or any regrets of things that you've done in your life that you would have hoped that would have made another difference?
Speaker 2: There are a couple of pieces I'd say I'd do differently (laughter), you know, not too many. Usually when I do something, it, it's, it's done, and, and it's, it's served its purpose, and, and has a very, very long life. There are a couple of other things that I have, I have done that I said, "You know, Randy [HistoryMaker Randy Duncan], you really could have, that really could have been--," but I was younger and not as polished, as it were. And so, you know, they say when you know better, you do better, and that's (laughter) that's exactly what happened. But as of late, there are things there that. No, I'd leave them as they, as they are, just like Amadeus [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart], you know. You know, he writes it, you know, writes it out. There's no going back (laughter), you know, yeah, yeah. But--
Speaker 1: Do you, did you play piano?
Speaker 2: I wouldn't say that I play. I know how to read and (laughter), and if I sat down and practiced a lot, yeah, I could. I did have to take piano proficiency, piano right, yes, in, in college [Illinois State University, Normal, Illinois]. As a vocal music major you have to do that, so I did do that. But, and I could if I really sat down and--but it's not my thing. It's not my forte. I want to be able to do it right now and just do it, but it don't come to me like choreography does (laughter), so. Yes, that takes a, that takes some work, definitely.
Speaker 1: I remember you saying early on you had a piano in your house. And then you said 'Amadeus' right now. And I said (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --okay, maybe there's a--
Speaker 2: There's a--
Speaker 1: --classical training in your background.
Speaker 2: Well, the classical training is, of course, in voice versus, versus the piano. The piano is there for when I have to get ready to do a wedding or something, and I have an accompanist come over. But I don't sit there and play (laughter), you know, yeah. I can play my little part right here, yeah, but that's it, find my notes.
Story_ID: 394702
Speaker 1: What values do you consider the most important to you right now in dance, given the fact that there are so many other factors of hip hop dance in our societies and praise dancing and other forms of, of, of dances that have just recently emerged. What values would you have in your interpretation of, of dance and what you--
Speaker 2: Well, I, I think in, in terms of, of dance, gosh, there, there are so many new things. You mentioned praise dance. You mentioned hip hop. Seems like hip hop is gonna be around for a while now. I mean, you know, we used to call it pop and lock back in the '70s [1970s] and all. I mean, everything is coming back around again, and that's basically what that, what that is but on a much larger scale now, but it's there. And then you've got praise dance, which was not around. We remember seeing Alvin Ailey [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater] doing 'Revelations' [Alvin Ailey] and all, and considered that something extraordinary, which it is and, and powerful. But it didn't go from the theater into the church, which is where it is right now. In a lot of the, the contemporary Baptist Churches and the Apostolic Churches, you know, they've gotten all this stuff going on. And what I, what I would say is that, you know, I watch these things, and basically these are coming from people who have not studied dance as an art form. They have basically gotten it off the streets or gotten it from what they see or what they feel. You know, and there's nothing wrong with feeling, and that's where we start. We start with the feeling, just as I did, just as I did. But my feeling is also the folks need to go and take class, really stud- study the art, the basics in dance so that they can really, really grow and develop as true dance artists and not just, you know, a little flip here and little thing there but could actually do some, some, some real work and understand what all of these dancers who are in these professional companies have gone through in order to make it there. And they can still do the hip hop, and they can still do the praise dance even better than those who are out there doing it. So, that is something that I'd like to share with those people who are out there doing this kind of work. I remember when, when Fatima [Fatima Robinson] came to me, the hip hop choreographer, who's a fantastic choreographer and, and dancer of hip hop, when she came to me at the--when we were working together to do the one chair piece in, in the film of, of 'Save the Last Dance.' And she didn't know any of the terminology for the ballet stuff, which wasn't a problem. Really, it wasn't a problem for me to, to show her. And she said, "Randy [HistoryMaker Randy Duncan], what's that called? Okay, yeah, I want to do some of that in my (laughter) part. Yeah, so you're talking about the bourrees?" I said, "Yeah, yeah." And, and it was just, it was just funny to, to know that, to know that this very, very well-known choreographer who does commercials for the Gap [Gap, Inc.] and works with Diana Ross and Beyonce and all of these other people she's working with and can't call out a, a dance step that, that, you know, everybody knows, you know. A lot of folks know plie, but that's as, (laughter) as much as they go. But it was just very funny to find. And she says you know, "Randy, when I first started, I went to this audition for," I think it was a Pepsi [Pepsico] commercial or something like that. And the guy said, "Okay, I want chasse pas de bourree turn, a pirouette, like that." And she said, "What, what (laughter)," you know, and she did. And he said, "Well, if you don't know what that is, you don't need to be out here." I'll never forget her saying that. And she says, "I just packed up my little bags, and I just went on out with my little friends (laughter) because we were not gonna make that audition," you know. And here she is being this top choreographer now. But also to say that every choreographer is not necessarily a dancer, yes. They might (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: --be able to move and stuff. As long as they have the tools to work with, then, you know, they can do it. And not every teacher is a, is necessarily a good dancer, but it's possible to, to teach, and to coach, and have wonderful students, incredible students, and to be the world's best coach, you know, without having to, to be the world's best dancer, yeah. So, so anyway, that's what I'd like to leave with them (laughter), yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 394703
Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered? You know, what do you want people to say--
Speaker 2: Oh, that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) about you?
Speaker 2: I would love for people to say that, you know, Randy [HistoryMaker Randy Duncan] was this incredible human being who had a love for life, and loved giving, and loved sharing, and expressing himself through movement. That is the way I'd like to be remembered, and cute (laughter).
Speaker 1: And cute (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: I guess that would also be what, what, that would be a part of your legacy. What would you want your legacy--
Speaker 2: My legacy (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) to be?
Speaker 2: Strong, powerful, individual. I think those are the, the, the words that I would use to describe what I do but quiet, in a very quiet way. You know, I, I, I think I'm a humble person and a very fair-minded individual. I think if you talk to people, they'll let you know that, that I, I really am that way, you know. I'm, I'm open to criticism, but just as well, you know, one has to be able to take what I have to give. And so, that's how I'd like to be remembered.
Speaker 1: Well, thank you so very much, Mr. Duncan, for this interview, and for your gracious time, and for all the contributions that you've led, and the life that you've led in the African American community.
Speaker 2: Thank you so much, Linda [Linda Williams] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We thank you very much.
