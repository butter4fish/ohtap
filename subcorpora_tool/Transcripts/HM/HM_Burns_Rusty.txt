Speaker 1: Good morning.  Just to slate for the camera, I introduced myself already.  Although you already know me, I'm Shawn Wilson with The HistoryMakers.  This is Neculai Burghelea, the videographer.  I'm the interviewer.  And today is October 7 [2005], and we are interviewing Mr. Rusty Burns [HistoryMaker Rusty Burns] here in New York City [New York, New York].  And I will just ask you to state your name and spell it out for me.
Speaker 2: My name is Isham Albert Burns, Jr.  Those are all the names.  I only use basically, except for legal matters, I only use Rusty.  I've been Rusty since the [U.S. military] service.  So that's basically what I'm known as.
Speaker 1: But spell that, your given name for me.
Speaker 2: I-S-H-A-M.  It was also my father's [Isham Burns, Sr.] name.
Speaker 1: Isham.  Is it--
Speaker 2: Isham.  Isham.
Speaker 1: Isham.  Is it Arabic?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Is it Jewish?  Yes.  It's both.  Depends on how you pronounce it.  It's either Arabic or Jewish.
Speaker 1: Why did they--it's your father's name as well.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Where did that name come from in the family (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I have no idea.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have no idea.  There was in that timeframe, but it was long after my father was born, I'm sure, there was a band leader by that name, Isham Jones.  And, but I don't think that had any influence on my father's.  I have no idea where my [paternal] grandparents [Clara Burns and James Burns] got the name from.
Speaker 1: What about Rusty?  Who started to call you Rusty?
Speaker 2: That's a story.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was in high school [David Starr Jordan High School, Los Angeles, California], my junior year I guess, in high school, and I was having trouble with people and my name.  Even teachers had difficulty pronouncing my name.  You'd be surprised at things that I've been called.  Even my family had trouble with my names.  My sister once used to call me Ice.  The other one called me Ish.  And my mother [Nona Bertrand Burns] called me Isham, Jr., which I've detested.  But anyway, in about, oh, maybe 1942, I got a nice job replacing my uncle in a shoeshine shop at the Burbank airport [Lockheed Air Terminal; Hollywood Burbank Airport, Burbank, California], and I made a lot of money.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was the name of that airport?
Speaker 2: Burbank at the time (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: Burbank airport. Today it's got another name.  I forget what it's called, but it has another name.  But it was Burbank airport at the time.  And I made a lot of money.  I had, you know, a lot of money, sixty-five dollars.  I made a lot of money.  So I decided that I was gonna get me a nickname.  And I was reading a funny book and I saw Rusty.  And I said, "Oh, that sounds like a nice nickname."  So I went down, I bought me one of these jackets like kids buy, and I had Rusty emblazoned on it.  Well, it didn't do very much, because everybody still--in school, my parents, and my siblings all called me by my real name anyway.  But when I went into the service in '43 [1943], nobody knew my real name except the paymaster.  So all of my classmates and all of comrades only knew me as Rusty.  So then I began to be known as Rusty when I came out--all the time I'm in service, I'm known as Rusty.  And when I come out of the service, people around me eventually, even my mother, eventually learned to call me Rusty.  I think that was probably ten or fifteen years, you know.  And, but all of all of my acquaintances, all of my friends all knew me as Rusty to this day.
Speaker 1: So what was the comic?  Do you know?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: No.  I don't remember what the comic was.
Speaker 1: Was Rusty black or white?
Speaker 2: I don't recall.  It was probably white, 'cause we didn't--I don't think we had black comics in those days, you know.
Speaker 1: That's right.  Right.
Speaker 2: So I'm sure it was white.  But I don't recall--I'm not sure it was a well-known something or other, you know.  It was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You just liked the name.
Speaker 2: --just the name, you know.
Speaker 1: Your date of birth?
Speaker 2: I was born July 24, 1925.
Speaker 1: Place of birth?
Speaker 2: In the Charity Hospital in New Orleans, Louisiana.  And I'm sure you recently have heard of the Charity Hospital.
Speaker 1: Yes.  We have.  But go ahead.  You want to say something about Charity Hospital?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Only that I was born there. You do know it was part of the devastation of the flood; part of the recent flood.  So I became--but I've always known that I was born in the Charity Hospital in New Orleans.
Story_ID: 311968
Speaker 1: So, I'm going to ask you, like, five sort of People magazine questions, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --and just simple short answers.  Your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Oh, my favorite food, red beans and rice.
Speaker 1: Do you have it on Mondays?
Speaker 2: You didn't know that (laughter)?
Speaker 1: (Laughter)  You have it on Mondays?
Speaker 2: Every Monday.
Speaker 1: And then--but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know that, huh?
Speaker 1: Okay.  But I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) See, when I tell people that, they look at me as if I'm strange.
Speaker 1: But I want to know the significance of having it on Mondays, because I've heard a couple of different reasons why.
Speaker 2: I have too, and I really don't really don't recall--I'm not sure I could recall what it was.  It had something to do with that you did over the weekend.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: See?  But I can't remember (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But it--was it about washing clothes?  Something about boiling water?
Speaker 2: It--I honestly don't remember what it was.  I honestly don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I do know there was some--there were several; there wasn't just one.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: There were several reasons for having red beans and rice on Monday.
Speaker 1: On Mondays.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you still do to this day.
Speaker 2: To this day.  I've done it all my life.  I had a wife who didn't cook my beans on Monday, I divorced her.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: You know.  I shouldn't say that.  It's not nice.  But it--Treneta [Treneta Davis Burns] will tell you, and she has a unique way of doing it, you know.  She's not necessarily a beans and rice person herself.  But she'll cook a large pot of beans, then she'll take the little plastic containers, fill them up, put them in the freezer; so now she doesn't have to cook beans for another six or eight weeks, you know.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Every Monday she takes the beans out, cooks some rice, and I have beans and rice.  But I do have beans and rice every Monday.
Speaker 1: So what is your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Oh, spring, for the smells; for the purity of the air; you know, the temperature; like being born, you know.  The spring is my favorite time of the year.
Speaker 1: Your favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color probably is tan.  Everything is tan.  You should see me all the time.  My wife tells me I should wear some other colors.  But I--if you put everything on a rack, I'll pull the tan one out and put it on.
Speaker 1: What about your favorite destination?
Speaker 2: Oh, now, I have a lot of those.  Excuse me if I don't have one.  If I had to choose one, I'd probably take Tahiti.
Speaker 1: Tahiti?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Why Tahiti?
Speaker 2: However, there were other places that I went that I love.  The one I travel the most is Mexico, which is very similar to Tahiti, so, but it's closer.  So, if I had to renounce Tahiti, then I would say Mexico.
Speaker 1: Your favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Let's see if I can think of one favorite phrase.  Probably escapes me right now, but I'm sure I have one.
Speaker 1: But it'll--when it comes up, just let it out.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Right.  I'll think of it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 311969
Speaker 1: So, we're gonna start talk--by talking about your family's history (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All right.
Speaker 1: --as much as you can tell me or as much as you remember about your--the history of your family.  And we'll start with your mother.  What was your mother's name?
Speaker 2: Nona Mae Bertrand, maiden name.
Speaker 1: Can you spell her last name?
Speaker 2: B-E-R-T-R-A-N-D.  It's a French name.  Bertrand.  Bertrans [ph.] was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Bertrand?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It's Nona Mae?
Speaker 2: Nona Mae.  Two words.
Speaker 1: So she was born when?  What's her date of birth?
Speaker 2: October 3, 1905.
Speaker 1: And she was born where?
Speaker 2: Biloxi, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: And what do you remember about your--did your mother ever tell you stories about her youth, about her childhood?
Speaker 2: Really, no.  If she did I don't recall it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't remember much about my mother's childhood.  My first information about my mother comes when she left Biloxi and went to California just before she was married and I was born.  She went to visit uncles in California.  And that's where my mother's history with me began.  I know very little of anything about her childhood.
Speaker 1: Okay. So--
Speaker 2: I do know she was born in Biloxi.  She stayed in Biloxi, you know, and that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: What about your mother's parents?
Speaker 2: My mother's parents--my grandfather was Joe Bertrand, Sr. [Joseph Bertrand, Sr.], and he was from Biloxi.  He was a brick mason.
Speaker 1: When was he born?
Speaker 2: I have no idea.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have no idea when my grandfather was born.  Probably something I should know.  I've got it somewhere, I'm sure.  But I don't know where he was born.  And he didn't live much past my being born.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But he was a brick mason, you know that.
Speaker 2: He was a brick mason, yeah.  And what you might call, at the time, probably a black middle class in Biloxi, 'cause he owned his own home, he built his own house, he had his own property, you know.  So, I considered my grandparents, my mother's parents, well-to-do; my father's parents [Clara Burns and James Burns] as well.
Speaker 1: What about your maternal grandmother, what was her name?
Speaker 2: Mama Rosie.  Rosie Bertrand, naturally.  I think her maiden name was Gordon.  I think I got that from my mother.
Speaker 1: Now, you--was your father French?  Half French?
Speaker 2: They're (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was his origin?
Speaker 2: --all--on both sides of my family there was French and Indian [Native American].  Both sides, German, French and Indian.  We were kind of a mixed--
Speaker 1: Now, where does the black come in?
Speaker 2: From--probably from my relatives who came from the islands.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let me get it straight.
Speaker 2: Originally--it comes before this, but my recollection is, originally my ancestors came from Dominica in 1854 to Biloxi.  These are the first ones that I can trace.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they were named Bertrand.  That's why (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  So the Bertrands came from
Speaker 2: --I think his name--Francois Bertrand [ph.].
Speaker 1: Francois Bertrand came from the Dominican [sic. Dominica]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, with his wife and I can't remember her name at the moment.
Speaker 1: And they settled in Biloxi?
Speaker 2: They settled in Biloxi, and that's where the family began to generate.  Now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So--go ahead.
Speaker 2: No.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: What do you--they themselves then were islanders.  Then they were French that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They were Africans.
Speaker 1: Africans.
Speaker 2: They were slaves.
Speaker 1: They were slaves.
Speaker 2: They were--they weren't slaves.  They were part of the slave trade that settled in Dominica as free people.  So they didn't come as slaves.  They came as free people.  They were never slaves, to my knowledge.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But they revolted, you know, in the Caribbean.  There were many revolts in the Caribbean by the slaves, and they were part of that, as I understand.  And so, they were free people when they left Dominica and came to Biloxi.
Speaker 1: And he arrived in Biloxi.  Do you know what he did for a living, Bertrand?
Speaker 2: No.  I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So then that family--how many children did they have?
Speaker 2: I kind of lost track between them and my grandparents.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's--there's a void in between (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --that I don't have committed to memory.  I may have some--
Speaker 1: So your grandparents, how many children did they have?  Your mother (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I think my grand--my mother's family was nine, and my father's [Isham Burns, Sr.] family was four.  I had my father, an uncle, and two aunts on my father's side.  And my mother's side, I had, I think, five girls and four boys; a large family.
Speaker 1: And they all basically grew up in the Biloxi area?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They all grew up in Biloxi.
Story_ID: 311970
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your father.  What was your--Bertrand.  When was your father born?  What was his name?
Speaker 2: My father was born in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Your father's name was?
Speaker 2: Isham Albert Burns.  And he was--Sr.  He was born March 31, 1906.
Speaker 1: And do you know any--what about his parents?  His--
Speaker 2: Well, his parents--
Speaker 1: --his father?
Speaker 2: --his mother was Clara Burns, who was married to James Burns, who was the first black principal in Biloxi--in Mississippi, excuse me; first black principal in Mississippi.  And this was probably around 1928 area.  I'm not sure exactly when it was, but I do remember reading the account of that.  He was also a lawyer.  And I think he came out of Jackson, Mississippi, and I think he returned to Jackson, Mississippi.  I don't ever remember seeing my paternal grandfather. My grandmother, yes; but my grandfather, I don't ever remember seeing.  He returned--after he and my grandmother separated, he returned to Jackson and kept his law practice.
Speaker 1: How many children did your father's family--grandparents have?  I mean your grandparents on your father's side.  There was your father and how many siblings?
Speaker 2: My father; a brother, Fred [Fred Burns]; an aunt, Geraldine [Geraldine Burns]; and another aunt who died very young, and I never--I don't remember what her name was; we called her Puddin'.
Story_ID: 311971
Speaker 1: Now, what year did your mother [Nona Bertrand Burns] and father [Isham Burns, Sr.] meet?  Do you know that?
Speaker 2: Oh, they met in high school.  They went to the same school together.  So they were--they were--my mother and my father probably knew each other from day one, 'cause they only had one school.
Speaker 1: What--do you know the name of what that school was?
Speaker 2: No.  I don't.  I went to it.  I also went to that school for a short period of time.
Speaker 1: So was that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But I don't remember the name of it.  I want to say something, but I'm sure that--(unclear)--
Speaker 1: But just say something that--
Speaker 2: I thought it was called Wicker [ph.] or something of that nature.
Speaker 1: Wicker.  Okay.
Speaker 2: But I'm sure that's not it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But that's a name that sticks in my mind.
Speaker 1: So at what point did the family move to New Orleans [Louisiana] and was that before you were born?
Speaker 2: My family moved to New Orleans when I was born.  As a matter of fact, my family moved to--my mother moved to New Orleans and my father moved to New Orleans to marry my mother, from Biloxi [Mississippi].  So they married in New Orleans, and I was born in New Orleans.  They lived in New Orleans from then on.
Story_ID: 311972
Speaker 1: What are your earliest memories of your childhood in New Orleans [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: I can remember--it's amazing, but I can remember being three years old and sitting on the steps on Law Street, where I was born.  I can remember the house.  I can almost remember the number.  I can remember events that--this was before I went to school.  I wasn't even going to school yet.  I can remember running around the side of the house.  My mother [Nona Bertrand Burns] was washing in the backyard.  This is one of those shotgun houses.  My mother was washing in the backyard.  And they cooked starch in those days, and it's hot.  And they would cook it, the starch, and she had this hot pot of starch sitting on the ground.  And I ran from the front around to the back, and I stepped in that hot starch.  I can show you the scars today.  That I remember.  I remember there was a butcher shop down the street in the next block.  And to keep me from straying, my mother told me that the butcher cut up little kids and sold the meat.  No doubt, I never left the area.  I would never go near that butcher shop.  But I remember that.  I remember there was a baseball field on the corner where black baseball players, who couldn't play anyplace else, where they played baseball.  I remember that.  I remember the London Avenue Pumping Station on London Avenue, which was just down to the corner and about three blocks away from where I lived.  And I remember that, remember London Avenue.  I can remember the Depression [Great Depression].  I can remember going down to a warehouse sort of a place with my little wagon and getting free welfare-type food.  I can remember that, you know, bringing home vegetables and fruit and that sort of thing.  I can remember going to the stadium where they played baseball, the Pelicans [New Orleans Pelicans] I think were their name.  The Pelican baseball team.
Speaker 1: Were they the Negro League?
Speaker 2: No.  White.
Speaker 1: White.  Okay.
Speaker 2: But I never saw them.  I never went there to play baseball.  I went there at Christmastime because we got free toys.  So I can remember that.
Story_ID: 311973
Speaker 1: I can remember the schools I went to.  My first school was Corpus Christi [Corpus Christi Catholic School, New Orleans, Louisiana].  I went to Corpus Christi in the first grade.  My mother [Nona Bertrand Burns] didn't like my progress, so she made me stay for the second year in the first grade, I remember that.
Speaker 2: Now, Corpus Christi was the school?
Speaker 1: It was a Catholic--it's a private school.
Speaker 2: A Catholic School.  Okay.
Speaker 1: On St. Bernard Avenue.
Speaker 2: Now, was she paying for you to go to school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --to this Catholic School?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Oh, it wasn't much, but she was paying.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Were there other black students in this school?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It was a black school.  It was a black area.
Speaker 2: Were the teachers black?
Speaker 1: I don't recall the teach--the nuns were white.
Speaker 2: The nuns were white.
Speaker 1: And the priest was white.  But I think all the kids were black.  I remember going to Valena C. Jones [Valena C. Jones Elementary School, New Orleans, Louisiana].  I can remember when I was about--this time I was about eight years old, I can remember putting a razor blade in my pocket; a single-edged razor blade, of all the stupid things, I'll never remember.  I don't know why I had the razor blade, but I can remember putting it in my pocket, and I still have the scar to prove it.  I can remember going to the school I spent most of my time at, and it was on Grandview [Avenue]--it was off of Grandview between Grandview and Perdido [Street], near what is now called Jefferson Davis Park, where it's about two blocks from.  It was called something else.  Called--I don't know what it's called, but it was called something else at that time; Division or something.  Anyway, I can remember going to Fisk High School [New Orleans, Louisiana]--Fisk as a grammar school, first.  I went there like the third grade until I graduated the sixth grade.
Story_ID: 311974
Speaker 1: I can remember where I lived, all the houses (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Where did you live?  Tell me.  Let's--
Speaker 1: Oh, the address?  I lived so many places.  I was born on Law Street [New Orleans, Louisiana].  I lived around the corner on London Avenue.  I lived on St. Ann [Street].  I live on Prieur [Street].  Let's see.  I lived on Perdido [Street].  I lived on Galvez [Street].  I lived on Broad [Street].  I lived on Gravier [Street].  Let's see if there's any place else.  Those are the ones that I remember (laughter).
Speaker 2: Wow (laughter).  So your mother [Nona Bertrand Burns] and father [Isham Burns, Sr.] split when you were relatively young?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I was about five years old.  The best I gather, I was about five years old at the time.
Speaker 2: And this was in the '20s [1920s] or '30s [1930s]?
Speaker 1: I was born in '25 [1925], so five years old in 1930.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).  So the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So it was about '31 [1931]
Speaker 2: Thirty-one [1931]--
Speaker 1: --when my father (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and the Depression [Great Depression] was in full swing.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  In full force.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: And how did your mother--how many children were there at the time?
Speaker 1: Five.
Speaker 2: How did she survive having five children to take care of?
Speaker 1: Well, through lots of ways.  One, we had a little bit of help from her family, her sisters and brothers.  They all were very close, and they helped.  You know, we needed a place to stay, we had a place to stay.  We were on welfare, so we got free food.  We were getting a pension--she was getting a very small pension from my father's work.  My father, incidentally, was a postman.  He was--the only job I knew he ever had was as a milk carrier in New Orleans [Louisiana] from the time my mother and father got married.  So she got a little pension from my father.  I'm not sure if there was any money coming from the government at that time.  When she worked, she worked as a waitress in a restaurant and not earning very much money.  But we were never hungry.  We never had to worry about a roof over our head.  We always had clothes.  We were always able to go to school.  We didn't live high on the hog, but we lived.  You know, she did a marvelous job bringing up five kids without a father.  She brought us all to California.
Story_ID: 311975
Speaker 1: So before you get to California, like in New Orleans [Louisiana], when you were a child, you talked about the baseball field that you played in sometimes.
Speaker 2: No.  I didn't play in it.  This was where the big (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The big kids played.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The big kids, or- or the grown men, you know.  The Negro League-type of ballplayers would hold, like, on a weekend they'd have a baseball game out on this field, on this diamond, see.
Speaker 1: Well, we talked some about you--off-camera about you working to earn a little money so that you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --can have your own money.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was a hustler.
Speaker 1: What are some of the things you did?
Speaker 2: Let's see.
Speaker 1: And where did you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Let me see when I could start.  I guess I was about nine years old when I started.  And my first venture was I got me a little wagon.  I don't know how I got the wagon.  I think I found it in the dump and put some wheels on it, I'm not sure.  A little red wagon.  And I would walk the neighborhoods picking up scrap metal, things that you could sell.  At the time, I thought it was a big thing.  You know, it really wasn't that much.  But I would walk all day Saturday picking up trash, and then in the evening I'd take it to the junkyard and I'd get three, four, five cents, you know.  A big day was a nickel, you know.  Two or three cents was probably the norm.  I would--I built me a shoebox, bought some shoe polish, shoeshine kit, and I would leave--on, I was on Gravier [Street] at the time, about six blocks from the French Quarter [New Orleans, Louisiana].  And I would walk down Canal Street.  I would walk all the way to the river and I would shine shoes.  I may shine one pair of shoes all day long, you know, for a nickel; or I may not shine any, I may not get anything.  But that was my walk--that was my pocket money for the most part.  They had--I just recalled this.  They had the numbers business.  You're familiar with the numbers business.  And my family had a friend who was writing the numbers (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) A runner.
Speaker 2: --you know, who would go around and write the numbers down, see.  And then when they would draw the numbers, come back--he had a little slip, lottery slip sort of about maybe one-inch wide and about maybe nine inches long with the numbers on them, the winning numbers on them.  And I had the job of folding those up, crinkling them and taking them around and dropping them on the steps.  And I'd probably get a nickel for that, you know.
Story_ID: 311976
Speaker 1: So I had various--various little hustles that I made kid money, which was enough for my entertainment.  I could go to the show on Saturday and get a candy bar, et cetera.
Speaker 2: What shows did you go to?
Speaker 1: There was a black show, that I can't remember the name of at the moment, down somewhere near the French Quarters off of Rampart Street [New Orleans, Louisiana] somewhere towards the river, where--this was a black-only theater where the movies were probably shorts, and they were probably black movies, as I recall.  But there was vaudeville, and this was every Saturday.  I'm sure they had it other times, but I went to school, so I never got a chance to do it any other time.  And Sundays I couldn't do it, so it was Saturdays.  We'd go and we'd watch the vaudeville.  And this was--these were black comedians, black musicians.  And as a kid, I'd go early in the morning and I'd sit there through show after show after show after--this was my whole entertainment for the week, you know.  And we did it with the kids, the bunch of us that we knew, we--the neighborhood, you know.  We would all go together and we would sit together, and we would perform together, you know.  We would misbehave together, whatever we did.  But I remember that.  I remember it was kind of risque a little bit.  The comedians were usually a little bit risque.  I remember that.  I remember the--'Flash Gordon,' I think it was--the serials.  They had serials--I think one of them was 'Flash Gordon,' I'm not sure.
Speaker 2: What was the name of the theater that was--was it the Orpheum [Orpheum Theater, New Orleans, Louisiana], maybe?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  The Orpheum Theater was another theater that blacks go to.  It was a segregated theater.  The blacks sat upstairs.  We had a different door to enter.  We didn't enter the main entrance, we had a side street entrance and we'd go up to the balcony, which was kind of dumb to me.  If you're going to segregate, you put me at the bottom, 'cause I'm up at the top where I can do all sorts of things to you, you know.  I thought it was kind of dumb.  We never did that, but I thought it was kind of, you know, not well thought out, you know.
Speaker 2: Let me ask you this, okay, and then talk to me about--the other theater was called the Singer Theater.
Speaker 1: Saegner [Saenger Theatre, New Orleans, Louisiana].
Speaker 2: Saenger.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Saenger.
Speaker 2: Saenger.
Speaker 1: Saenger.  Right down the street from another store, which is called--which is a department store called Maison Blanche [New Orleans, Louisiana].  Maison Blanche--and this is--we had the reputation, you could not go into this store. Women: you could go in and shop, but you couldn't try anything on.  If you touched it, you bought it, you know.  This was the time for black women.  If you went into that store and you touched something, you bought it.  You couldn't--definitely couldn't try it on.  And once you bought it, you couldn't bring it back.  That was the end of that.
Story_ID: 311977
Speaker 1: Getting past that and back to the Saenger [Saenger Theatre, New Orleans, Louisiana], one day, for some reason that escapes me at the moment, I decided to go into the white theater.  Now, being of fair skin and not necessarily curly hair, I got in line with the white kids.  Now, there's kind of a philosophy in the South, as I see it.  I'm not sure this is correct, but this the way I see it:  if you're very dark-skinned, you can be identified as a black, you can be discriminated against easily without any fear of being in error.  But if you have light skin, there's a little bit of doubt, and if there's any doubt, then we don't pursue the discrimination.  We don't do the bias, you know.  And so I got away with it.  I got into the theater.  Nobody said anything to me.  They sold me a ticket and nothing unusual happened.  And as usual, I went up to the balcony because that's where I always go anyway, see.  So I went up to the balcony, and the thing that---I was sorry I really did it, because the demeanor of--this is a matinee with all children--the demeanor of the children, the racial epitaphs, the conduct was embarrassing to me.  And I made a point never, ever to go back to the Saenger again.
Speaker 2: Right.  How so?  Like, can you remember what they were saying when they were talking to kids?
Speaker 1: You know, I can't remember verbatim, but it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But it was--
Speaker 1: --if--I'll give you an example.  If a black person for some reason showed up on the screen, a maid or something, you know, why, then the n-word was being recited, you know, at pitch levels.
Speaker 2: By children (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Whatever dialogue was demeanoring [sic. demeaning] to blacks at the time, would be common in this particular environment, you know.  The kids--and I've seen this in later days.  I've seen this very thing.  I had an occasion to go to see 'Rocky,' 'Rocky I,' the movie in Los--in Woodland Hills [California], Sherman Oaks, California, in a theater.  Now, it's current times.  And I had, obviously under the influence of alcohol, several young men, white men, who were shouting racial slurs, during this, the fighting scenes in the theater.  This is California in 1990; 1990 or it was before I retired.
Speaker 2: No.  It was the '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: Nineteen eighty-five [1985].
Speaker 2: When was 'Rocky'?
Speaker 1: In the '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: In the '70s [1970s]?  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, whenever that was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --but these were modern times, you know.
Speaker 2: The mid-'70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: And to do this in California at this timeframe was, was shocking.
Story_ID: 313685
Speaker 1: Continuing on tape two.  Nineteen--late '70s [1970s], you're at the 'Rocky' movie.  Kids in front of you are being crazy.  Take the story up from there.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, they were performing in the show, and we had to tolerate 'cause they were nearby with racial slurs.  And when we got out, they followed us out of the show, out of the theater.  And we're walking down the side of the theater and they're behind us, and it came to the point where we were going to have to fight.  It was clear that the guy I was with, who was a young coach from one of the schools, and his wife and my wife, that we were not going to be able to get out of this without a fight.  So we just--he and I decided, okay.  We got to fight.  You take one, I'll take the other one.  Well, what happened was, when we turned around to fight, some other white people who were following this, came in between us and took these three gentlemen, kind of got them away.  I don't--I can't explain whether they threatened them or whether they---but the--a whole bunch of other white men and women, elder--you know, mature men and women, got in between us and them, and, you know, whatever they said to them was enough that we could then walk to our car without being threatened.  But this is modern times.  So, this is, you know, what happened in New Orleans [Louisiana] in the '30s [1930s] can happen today, too.
Story_ID: 313686
Speaker 1: So let me just explore a little more about that incident going to the Saenger Theatre [New Orleans, Louisiana], because I want to get, like, just your mindset. You knew you were black (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah. There was--
Speaker 1: --and you knew that it was segregation.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But, what made you know that you could pass for being white to get into this theater?
Speaker 2: You know, again, I don't know if that might have been--I might have been trying to see what I could get away with.  Okay.  See how far I could go.  I actually thought I'd get in the line and they'd throw me out.  That's what I thought.  But when they didn't throw me out of the line, and I got to the ticket office, and I--my ticket was only a nickel or something--I could buy a ticket.  Well, you know, I got a ticket.  Then I got into the theater, and I could walk up and sit down in a seat, no one confronted me at any point in time.  You know, it was all almost as though I was a part of the group, I wasn't there; one or the other.
Speaker 1: What are some of the other things you experienced as far as segregation and being a child in New Orleans [Louisiana]? The street cars?
Speaker 2: And New Orleans wasn't as bad.  Mississippi was a really bad place.  New Orleans, you know, things like you're walking--I got a shoeshine box, I'm walking down the street, somebody's got to rub me on the head.  See.  I'm always being boy.  I was called boy when I was wearing my uniform.  In Montgomery, Alabama, I was called boy by a janitor, you know.  The having to ride on the back of the streetcar.  Now, I have to put this into perspective for you.  Segregation and discrimination at a time when I was growing up was the only thing I knew.  I didn't--I didn't think too much of it, because it was kind of the accepted norm, you know.  There wasn't--there weren't any civil rights that I knew of.  There wasn't any civil rights marches or protests going on, you know.  Everybody just lived within the system as best they could.  And so as a child, I assumed that this was the way the world, you know, revolved.  I got on the back of the streetcar just like everybody else.  And if they moved the thing back, I got back one more seat just like everybody else.  I went into the train station or the bus station or wherever I went, and I went through the colored door, you know.  I drank at the colored fountain, if I drank at all.  I went into the colored bathroom, if I went to the bathroom at all.  And I didn't like it, but I didn't know that there was anything better anyplace else.  I didn't know about the North and the South and the East.  I mean, I didn't know about the North and the West at the time.  So, you know, it was a way of life for me.  I didn't take issue with it.  If that's the way it was, that's the way it was.
Story_ID: 313687
Speaker 1: So can you describe the neighborhoods, some--well, a couple of the neighborhoods you grew up in?  And by that, I mean a sense of community--did you feel a sense of community?  Did you play stickball outside?  What--you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  We didn't.
Speaker 1: --what was the atmosphere like?
Speaker 2: I don't know if it was because I was primarily a loner.  I was kind of a shy kid, by myself.  I did my thing.  You know, I read, toys; I did things on my own.  I didn't go out much in the street.  I imagine there were times when we played kick the can or whip the whip or we climbed trees or we had (unclear) pop guns or we played mumblety-peg or we played marbles; you know, those were things we did.
Speaker 1: Mumblety-peg. What's that?
Speaker 2: Mumblety-peg.  That--you take an ice pick and you--the idea is you drew a circle on the ground, the idea is to throw the ice pick down on the ground and it would stick up in the circle.  Mumblety-peg.  That can be dangerous.
Speaker 1: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 2: If you don't believe, you can ask my sister.  Those were the activities--bear in mind I only went thirteen, if I was in school, we played in the schoolyard.  If I wasn't in school, I was hustling.
Story_ID: 313688
Speaker 1: You know so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, did everyone in New--can you remember, did most of the people that you were around look like yourself or were they dark-skinned?
Speaker 1: I would--they were both.  But I would say predominately they looked like me.  Predominantly, you know.  But there were dark-skinned and light-skinned, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What do you--go ahead.
Speaker 1: And New Orleans [Louisiana] has probably, exists today, cultures have a tendency to commingle.  And we do that today.  We still do it.  Okay.  And we had a tendency to do that.  I--not me, being a child, but families, the people, the adults in the area, had a tendency to do that in the South.  You had the Creole section.  You had, you know, sort of--I'm sure that's--they had different names for them, but there weren't totally any one thing.  There were either--there were dark and light; some white as the white people; some that's brown and some are very dark, you know, all in the areas.  But they were basically in their own areas.  That's not to say that there might not be a white person having homes in those areas.  They have homes in our areas, but we did not have homes in their areas.
Speaker 2: As a kid, do you remember being told or anything about light-skinned people may get a little better job or a little better education than a darker-skinned person?
Speaker 1: No.  I never heard any of that.
Speaker 2: No?  Okay.
Speaker 1: No.  Never heard any of that.  Although thinking about it, I have experiences in my life that kind of bear that out.  There have been times--later, you'll get to some part later (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.  And you'll remember to bring--
Speaker 1: --and I'll bring you in on that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  That particular aspect of it.
Story_ID: 313689
Speaker 1: So let's talk about your schools.  You went to first grade, or what can you remember?
Speaker 2: Went to first grade twice at Corpus Christi [Corpus Christi Catholic School, New Orleans, Louisiana].  I went to second grade at Valena C. Jones [Valena C. Jones Elementary School, New Orleans, Louisiana].  Third through sixth grade at Fisk [Fisk High School, New Orleans, Louisiana], F-I-S-K.
Speaker 1: At Fisk, who were the teachers?
Speaker 2: There was, let's see, Mrs. Jones [ph.] taught third grade; Mr. Smith [ph.] taught sixth grade; Mrs. Jenkins [ph.] taught first grade.
Speaker 1: Who stands out as a good teacher for you?  Who was good for you?
Speaker 2: All of my teachers were good.  You know, I can say this without fear.  I did not have a bad teacher in New Orleans [Louisiana].
Speaker 1: What sorts of things were they teaching you at that time?
Speaker 2: Everything.  And you were taught.  I got a better education in the first six grades in New Orleans than I got at the next six grades in California combined.  I had algebra in the seventh grade.  When I got to California, I was so far ahead of their curriculum I never went to the eighth grade.  I skipped the eighth grade all together and went from the seventh to the ninth grade.  But the educational system in the South, we had black teachers who were dedicated and who were disciplinarians.  That's the most--I guess that's the predominant quality they had.  They were disciplinarians.  If you did something you weren't supposed to, you got smacked.  And if you went home and told your mother, you got smacked again.  See.  And I think that's the way it ought to be.  I love that model.  But I was--I had to learn because I was made to learn.  I didn't think I was being made to learn.  I just thought somebody was--I just thought the teachers were teaching, you know.  We had spelling, penmanship, arithmetic and English.  We didn't have languages.  We had all the basic studies.  We didn't have any social studies.  We didn't have homeroom and places where you could goof off, you know.  None of that.  Every class you had, there was an element of education involved in it for six grades.  You had--it was every class was some curriculum that is required in education.
Story_ID: 313690
Speaker 1: Now, at that time when you were a kid in the first six grades, did you have this love for flying, or was that to come later?
Speaker 2: I began to develop my love for flying about--about the fifth grade [at Fisk High School, New Orleans, Louisiana].
Speaker 1: And how did that come about?  Where did it come from?
Speaker 2: I was standing outside and I saw a gyrocopter.  I believe pretty much it was a gyrocopter, which is an airplane.  It's like a helicopter that flies like an airplane.  And I saw one go over.  That was one.  My second one was, I saw a dirigible go over.
Speaker 1: You saw what?
Speaker 2: A dirigible.  That's a--it's like a (unclear), like a Zephyr.  It's a dirigible.  I think we called them dirigibles in those days.  They're called blimps now, but it was a dirigible.  And then one day I saw what might have been a commercial airplane, a tri-motor of some sort.  I don't recall whether it had two wings or one wing.  I don't think it was a Ford tri-motor.  But I saw a fairly large airplane.  And the sound, you know, was so intriguing that that was when my love, my desire for flying--I was intrigued by it, fascinated by flying.  So I began to make--I didn't have any money to buy models.  If--if they had them at that time.  So I'd get apple crate boxes and cut up little pieces and make airplanes.  You know, you could imagine what they looked like.  And I would walk around the house and the neighborhood flying my airplane.  Now this was my first introduction to aviation.  I knew nothing about it except that airplanes flew.  That graduated to probably when I was twelve, maybe; eleven or twelve, model airplanes somewhat became available, and I began to build model airplanes.  And I did that.  My love for the love of flying wasn't much available to me, to my knowledge, to read about flying.  So all I knew was what was exposed to me or either in the sky or in the stores.
Story_ID: 313691
Speaker 1: What year did the family move out to Los Angeles [California] from New Orleans [Louisiana] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.  That was a staged gathering.  My mother [Nona Bertrand Burns], when she decided to go to California, probably about 1937.  We had--she had sisters--she had a brother.  She had two brothers in California, and all the rest of the family was still here.  But she had two--she had one or two brothers in California.  So she scraped up enough bus fare--train fare, excuse me--she scraped up enough train fare.  She took my baby sister, and she went to California.  She left me with an aunt.  She left my brother with my father's [Isham Burns, Sr.] sister.  She left my other sister with another relative.  And she went to California.  Then she would send for us.  Well, my oldest sister was in Chicago [Illinois] with my aunt.  My brother was in Jackson, Mississippi, or Carthage, Mississippi, with my father's sister [Geraldine Burns]; and I was in New Orleans with my mother's sister, my aunt, at the time.  She left.  She went.  At some point in time, I'm not sure what the interval was, she sent for my brother, and that was probably about six or eight months after she got there.  She saved up the money, she sent for my brother.  So he got on a train and he went to California.  About a year later, my sister--my aunt in Chicago brought my sister just ahead of me.  In October 19--1939, I arrived in Los Angeles.  I will never forget the trip.  It was the most, it was the most exciting undertaking to that time that I'd taken.  I can remember standing in the vestibule of that train, which was segregated until I got to El Paso [Texas].  When I got to El Paso, I could go in any part of the train I wanted.  Once I left El Paso going through New Mexico, there's--going through the Arizona desert, time--and I remember sitting in the morning looking at the sun come up, come up over the desert.  That was the most inspiring thing I had seen 'til that point in time.  To this day I can still marvel at--well, I stand and just look at this, you know.  And I fell in love with the West.  About that time was when my love of the West, Arizona, New Mexico, particularly California.  When I arrived in Los Angeles, looking at the mountains, the clear air--we didn't have smog in those days--the clear air, the beauty of it; I just--I was home.  I was satisfied with it.  No signs on the seats on the streetcars; no signs on the fountains; no signs on the doors.  There were signs, but not where I would be, you know.  I saw signs as late as, oh, let's see.  When was that last time I saw a sign?  On Firestone Boulevard in South Gate [California], probably about after the war, 1954, '55 [1955]; in that area--era, rather.
Speaker 1: So when you arrived in Los Angeles, you were still--you were in ninth grade.
Speaker 2: I was--actually I had just finished the seventh grade.  I should have gone into the eighth grade.  But for reasons, I'm not sure how they came about it, the school decided that I didn't need to go to--I had already had what was--they were teaching in the eighth grade.  So they put me in the ninth grade at McKinley [William McKinley Junior High School] in Los Angeles which is now George Washington Carver Junior High School [George Washington Carver Middle School, Los Angeles, California]; and I finished the ninth grade here in, like, 1940--the summer of '41 [1941], I think; '40 [1940], '39 [1939], '40 [1940]; the summer of '40 [1940].  Yeah, '41 [1941], '42 [1942], '43 [1943]; summer of '40 [1940] I finished school there.  And we lived on 41st Street, one block down from Jefferson High School [Thomas Jefferson High School, Los Angeles, California].  You may have heard of Jefferson.  Recently, we had some student riots there.  And I'd see the kids coming home--they--and they were fighting and it did frighten me, the school did.  So decided I wasn't going to school right next door.  I would walk down six, seven blocks to the red car line and I would take the red car to Watts [Los Angeles, California], and I went to Jordan High School [David Starr Jordan High School, Los Angeles, California].  My mother decided, "Well, if you're gonna go to Jordan, I might as well move out there."   So that's what she did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, is she--I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  That's what she did.
Speaker 2: That's what she did.  She moved out there.  So then we all basically from that point on--from, like, my fifteenth year on I was in Watts.  We didn't call it Watts where we lived.  We had a fancy name.  It was Central Avenue Gardens [Los Angeles, California].  And Watts wasn't quite--didn't quite have the stature, you know.  So we were in this middle class neighborhood on relief, on welfare, in this middle class neighborhood called Central Avenue Gardens.
Story_ID: 313692
Speaker 1: Now--and at that time, what was your mother [Nona Bertrand Burns] doing for a living?
Speaker 2: She was working as a domestic in Hollywood [Los Angeles, California].  She worked for some of the names in Hollywood.
Speaker 1: Some of the movie star names.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, one of them--it wasn't a movie star.  You know, the name slips me this time.  It was a wealthy family, and I can't remember just exactly at the moment who it was.  It was somebody.  It was a well-known family.  You know, it wasn't the Hearsts, but it was somebody similar.  My aunt worked for Clark Gable, one of my aunts.  So the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Doing what?
Speaker 2: --family mostly at that point--
Speaker 1: What did she do for Clark Gable?
Speaker 2: Domestic.  She was a housekeeper, you know.  My youngest uncle shined shoes at the Burbank airport [Lockheed Air Terminal; Hollywood Burbank Airport, Burbank, California]; good job.  Didn't sound like much, but it was a good job.  He made good money shining shoes at the Burbank airport.
Speaker 1: And what year did you join him at the Burbank airport to shine shoes?
Speaker 2: Oh, I didn't join him.  I took his place when he went on vacation for a couple of weeks.  And I'd say I was probably sixteen at the time--sixteen, seventeen; yeah, I was probably sixteen at the time.  It was a year before I graduated [from David Starr Jordan High School, Los Angeles, California], and I graduated when I was seventeen, so I was probably sixteen.  And this was a big deal, you know.  Being around airplanes, I'm surprised I got any shoes shined with all the airplanes around me, you know.
Story_ID: 313693
Speaker 1: My love of aviation had grown tremendously.  Now I'm reading--and that's a story I'll get into when we get into how I, you know, I got into aviation.
Speaker 2: But go ahead.  Tell me now.  This is a good time.
Speaker 1: Well, in school, it has to do with school.
Speaker 2: Go ahead.  We're talking about school.
Speaker 1: Right.  When I left--when we moved from South Central, Los Angles [California], into Central Avenue Gardens, 96th Street, and I was going to Davis Starr Jordan High School [Los Angeles, California] on 103rd Street near Alameda, I had a teacher named Cosgrove, Mr. Cosgrove [ph.], white man, who, sometime around 1942, the Los Angeles Unified School District, because of the war [World War II, WWII]--now we were in the war now and there's a need for pilots and the government has opened the door for Negro pilots, which I didn't know.  I didn't know that at the time.  I couldn't afford the Pittsburgh Courier [New Pittsburgh Courier] and the Chicago Defender, so I wasn't up on the news at the time.  I really had no knowledge that black pilots were being trained at Tuskegee [Alabama] at this time, and they were.  But Mr. Cosgrove, the Unified School District decide to initiate a program called aeronautics into the high school curriculum.  And it had two schools because they had two people who knew aeronautics.  Mr. Cosgrove was one of them and he happened to be a teacher at Jordan.  And so, of course, the minute the aeronautics class became available, I took it.  And this was just, you know, this was home for me.  I loved every minute.  And it was all phases of aviation.  It was aircraft, theory of flight, navigation, meteorology, radio communications; everything that had to do with aviation.  And it was fairly thorough, using books that were used by the services to train.  Well, anyway, this class started in the fall session, I believe, of '42 [1942], 'cause I graduated in '43 [1943]; in the fall session of '42 [1942].  So I'm in this class for one semester, and Mr. Cosgrove notified--in January of '43 [1943], Mr. Cosgrove notified the class that the [U.S.] Army had opened up their flying training programs not only to blacks, but now they have lowered the age to eighteen.  See, up to now it was twenty-one.  They had lowered the age to eighteen, and they were giving an examination next week at the federal building.  And this was my first realization that my desire to fly--which up to this point I felt would never materialize.  The thought never occurred to me that I'd ever really be able to fly.  I'd go to an airport and they'd run me off of it, you know.  So I really had no thought that I would ever have an opportunity to fly.  But Mr. Cosgrove brought this to my attention.  I went down, took the test, did well on it, got my notice two weeks later that I had passed it.  But I was only seventeen, so I couldn't go in yet.  And I--knowing I passed the test did not solidify my thinking that I was going to be--I was ever gonna to get there.  You know, there's always things that happen in between to black people, and I assumed something was gonna happen in between to this black person.  But as fate would have it, in June I got my notice that I had been accepted and that I would report--and I think it was on my birthday in July, July 24th, 1943, I would be inducted into the [U.S. military] service.
Story_ID: 313694
Speaker 1: I had a lot of--I had a lot of setbacks, potential destructive setbacks, one of which after I had been notified that I would be accepted, I had to take a flight physical.  So I had a schedule, I went down to March Air Force Base [March Air Reserve Base, Riverside, California] to take a flight physical.  Well, to give you some idea, when I graduated from high school [David Starr Jordan High School, Los Angeles, California], I was 5'7", and I weighed 117 pounds; not exactly a strapping youth.  When I went to take my flight physical, the flight surgeon said, "Every was fine," he said, "But I don't think I can pass you because your weight and your height are not compatible.  You're too thin for your height."  Well, that broke my heart, and I began to complain.  I began to, you know, my little shuffling.  And I had some scars on my shins, and I said to him--I can remember this clear--I said, "Well, actually I lost weight because I had a disaster.  I hit some hurdles toward legs, got infected and I lost a lot of weight."  Well, he knew I was lying.  He knew I was lying, but it gave him an opportunity--he says, "Well, I'll"--he says, "I'll tell you what I'll do," he says, "I'll pass you this time, but they're gonna get you when you get, you know, on your next flight physical they're gonna catch you then."  "Well, I'll take my chances.  Just let me get by here."  Which, thankfully he did.  I went into the [U.S. military] service, I was inducted.  I went through basic training down at Fort MacArthur [San Pedro, California], and that's where I was inducted, at Fort MacArthur.  They put me on a train sometime in September and sent me down to Keesler Field [Keesler Air Force Base, Biloxi, Mississippi].  I'm home.  Keesler Field, Mississippi, Biloxi [Mississippi].  I spent half my life in Biloxi, you know, so this is like throwing me into the briar patch.  I really had a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Can you spell that for me, Keesler Field?
Speaker 1: K-E-E-S-L-E-R.  I believe that's the way it is.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I'm sure that's the way.  Keesler.
Speaker 2: And it's in Biloxi?
Speaker 1: Biloxi, Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Keep going.
Speaker 1: And so I get down there, and now I'm with a group.  There's five hundred of us.  And this is a staging area, pre-aviation cadet.  It's a staging area.  Where we do things, we learn the basics, military basic training; a little bit of that.  We do a lot of psychomotor testing to see what you--how your reflexes are.  But once more, they gave me a physical.  Now, this is another story.  Went, took the physical, and, of course, they fail me, physical.  I was still weighing--I was still 5'7", and I still weighed 117 pounds, and I was supposed to weight 127.  But they got--these are not officers giving the flight physicals now.  These are corpsmen, Army corpsmen, see; and they're white.  So I didn't pass the physical.  Everybody got by but me, and I'm begging and pleading.  And this corpsman said, "Well, I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll give you two weeks."  He said, "If you can gain the weight in two weeks, then you'll be all right."  So, oh, then, we have a camaraderie, the guys.  This is black people at their best, people I would rarely see, the black people who are so closely knit so much co-op--and so much in support of each other as this group of people were, as we were.  And that's not just my group, this is the groups that preceded me.  This is a time--this is a different time for us.  But anyway, they took me back to the barrack and they were determined that we were gonna get these ten pounds.  And my aunt who lived in Biloxi, Mississippi, was kind of a favorite of the first sergeant, put it that way.  So I could get anything I wanted.  First sergeant came in with a stalk of bananas.  And they were gonna banana me those ten pounds.  Two weeks, water and bananas.  Water and bananas.  And I'm telling you, I was never so full of water and bananas in all my life.  And it was doing fine.  I think I had a lot of those pounds, you know.  I think I managed to get a few of them.  The morning I'm supposed to go down to take the physical, some smart aleck said, "One more canteen of water," you know, "And another few bananas."  And, of course, everything came up.  I lost everything.  To shorten the story, I went to take the physical, went with two of my buddies, one of whom has passed away, the other is in Augusta, Georgia, right now; Freddie Pendleton [Frederick Pendleton] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Can you give me their names?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Freddie Pendleton and Henry Moore.  They go with me, see.  So the corpsman--I'm on the scale, and I probably only weigh only 120 now, you know--I'm on the scale and one on one side and the other on the other.  They put--the scale is doing this (gesture), you know; one on one side putting his foot on the scale, you know, and the corpsman would knock him away, and the other would put his foot on and he'd knock--this went on for five minutes, you know.  And then we--at first the corpsman--it was serious, you know; then it got to be a joke.  He says, "Okay, guys."  He said, "What do you want me to do?"  And he says, "Well, he needs to weigh 127 pounds."  So the corpsman says, "Okay."  He wrote down 127 pounds.  From then on I had it made.  I began to grow, I began to gain weight, so I never had the problem again.  But I had to overcome those just to get there.  You heard of faith, you know.  How things--God--how things can happen.  I never would have made it if it had not been for that first flight surgeon and for the corpsman and my two buddies, you know, getting me through.  So I got past it.
Story_ID: 313695
Speaker 1: So you arrived in Mississippi--
Speaker 2: Keesler Field [Keesler Air Force Base, Biloxi, Mississippi]
Speaker 1: --in 1943.
Speaker 2: September of 1943.
Speaker 1: And what--talk to me about the experience in the [U.S.] Army, the training that you were receiving as an airman.
Speaker 2: Well, that comes out of--that comes away from Keesler Field.  There was none of that there, see.
Speaker 1: What was happening--what happened?
Speaker 2: Keesler Field was basic training.  We would--we'd go out and (unclear) in the tent.  We would learn how to shoot a gun.  We would do psychomotor testing, you know, Do you see?  What do you see?  What do you see?  What do you see?  Can you make--can you rub your stomach and chew gum at the same time kind of thing.  And it basically was a staging--it was a staging area, so you didn't do a lot of things, you know.  It was waiting for the next opportunity to ship the next group into the institution at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama]; not the airfield, the institute.  That was where you would go, see.  So in January, the first of January we were shipped, I think it was the first of January, we were shipped to Tuskegee Institute in Alabama as pre-aviation cadets.  Now, here we get college courses, which was another staging area.  Here we lost about half of our guys, because the government decided that all--that the guys with previous military training, they needed soldiers.  So all of the guys in the group with previous military training were taken out, most of them, and sent back to the infantry and the cavalry or wherever they came from.  So we're down, maybe, 250 guys now.  But we're taking college courses and we get ten hours of flying, too.
Story_ID: 313696
Speaker 1: We were talking about, you're at the institute [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], you're taking twelve hours of classes and being trained as a soldier, or--continue.
Speaker 2: I would be remiss if I didn't relate part of this journey to you, because it's our--part of our history.  Every airman knows the name Chehaw [Alabama], C-H-E-E-H-A-W [sic.].  When we got--when we were on the train going to Tuskegee [Alabama], there was no place there, no train station for us to go to.  We didn't go to Montgomery [Alabama] like most people did and find another way.  We went to a little, small outhouse-looking building somewhere in the middle of nowhere called Chehaw.  And this is where all the Tuskegee Airmen came on the train, this is where you got off the train at.  So if you say, "Chehaw" to any Tuskegee Airman, it's going to bring a chuckle, because we've made jokes about Chehaw for all our time.  Anyway, we went to the institute.  And I believe Dr. Carver [George Washington Carver] at the time.  And we were taking college classes.  We were going to classes much the same as the students that were.  And we got a pre-aviation cadet training.  We got ten hours in a Piper Cub [Piper J-3 Cub].  You don't solo.  You just get ten hours of flight training.  The instructors were all black.  They were all CPT [Civilian Pilot Training] training people.  And this was kind of to get an orientation or a feel for whether you had the potential for becoming a pilot or not.  I don't know that anybody failed to get through there, but you either got a recommendation for or against.  And if you got one that said, "I don't think this guy can make it," you weren't going very far, you know.  But if you got one that said, "Oh, I think he'll make a great pilot," then you--the way was paved slightly for you.  So we were there, and I'm not sure I'm gonna get the timeframes exactly right, but we were there in January, but we stayed there, and I'm gonna say January and February, and then in April, May, June--January, February, March, April--no, February, March.  At one point in time, they took us out of this pre-aviation cadet program and put us into the Army Air Corps Cadet Training Program, the first phase of what is preflight.  And if I remember correctly, each phase was like maybe six weeks or something of that nature.  You had upper and lower phases.  And the phases were preflight, primary, basic and advanced, and that's where you graduated.  These were the phases.  And it was a year all together the whole program was a year.  In backing up I can go December, November, October for advanced; September, August and July for basic, which sounds about right; July, June, May, April for primary.  So it was January, February, March for preflight.  You go through the preflight, and then it was April, May, June for primary.  Primary was done at--not the Tuskegee Air Base [Tuskegee Army Airfield; Sharpe Field, Tuskegee, Alabama]--primary was done at the institute.  We had a field called Moton Field [Tuskegee, Alabama], and that's where we did our primary in PT-17s [PT-17 Stearman].  We were fortune in that the government had some airplanes called Fairchild 19s [Fairchild PT-19 Cornell]; Fairchild 26s [Fairchild PT-26 Cornell] (unclear).  They went from the PT-17, which was a gorgeous airplane, beautiful airplane; for some reason they went to this low-wing, wide landing gear, and I think it was because of the landing characteristics of the PT-17 had a tendency to ground loop because of the narrow gear.  So they went to this low-wing airplane with the main landing gear with an inline engine to improve the potential for--to minimize a potential for--for accidents.  It didn't work.  It wasn't a good airplane.  So we go back to the PT-17.  About the time I went to primary, they went back to the PT-17, which was--I can be most grateful for that, because it was--I just loved that airplane.  It was a--it was just an airplane that, you know, the wind-in-your-hair type thing, you know; Gosport tubes, talk to the instructor; sitting in an open cockpit with that radial engine in front, you know, with the two wings; do anything you want.  The airplane would just--it had no limitations.  So we had--I had three wonderful--upper and lower primary.
Story_ID: 313697
Speaker 1: And then we went to the institute [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  And I think that was in June--July, the 1st of July.  We went to the institute to take basic training.  Basic training was in--now, each one of these phases we'd lose somebody.  We would start out, and I don't know exactly what the numbers were, but I can go backwards, but we'd start out with--we started out at Keesler Field [Keesler Air Force Base, Biloxi, Mississippi] with about five hundred guys.  We lost maybe two hundred, 250 of them in pre-aviation cadet.  We lost another--about half.  Each time we go we'd lose about half, about half, something of that sort.  So getting through each phase was stressful, you know.  I had a pretty good attitude, because I never thought I was going to fail.  I was--I thought I was so much attuned to this aviation thing, I ate, slept, and drank aviation, you know.  I didn't do anything in the daytime that didn't involve aviation, so the thought never occurred to me that I wasn't gonna make it.  But I felt sorry for the guys that didn't.  And we lost better pilots than were graduating from the other schools, from Montgomery [at Maxwell Field; Maxwell Air Force Base, Montgomery, Alabama]; I can tell you that.  We lost better pilots.  I repeat that:  we lost better pilots than they graduated.  Anyway, we go through basic with the BT-13 [Vultee BT-13 Valiant], and I get through that successfully.  I get into advanced, we have the AT-6.  All of the airplanes were flying, you love them, you know.  You love the BT-13, the Vibrator, because of its idiosyncrasies and it had many.  The Vultee Vibrator.  You loved the AT-6 because now we're getting into retractable landing gear, controllable pitch propellers, 650 horsepower engines, you know.  They used these things for fighter planes.  They put 30-caliber bullet--machineguns in the wings and used them for fighter planes, you know.  Might still be using them in Mexico as far as I know.
Story_ID: 313698
Speaker 1: But this was--this was an experience. I successfully got through the program.  In December, 28th of December 1944, my class graduated [from the Civilian Pilot Training Program at Tuskegee Army Airfield; Sharpe Field, Tuskegee, Alabama].  There were twenty single-engine pilots and there were fifteen multi-engine pilots.  The advanced, we trained separately.  Up to advanced, we trained together.  Then in advanced they went to the multi-engine airplanes and we went to the single-engine airplanes.  Got through, we graduated.  My mother [Nona Bertrand Burns] came all the way from California to pin my wings on.  That was an event that I will long remember, along with one of my aunts.
Speaker 2: How old were you at the time?
Speaker 1: I was nineteen.
Speaker 2: So did that make you one of the youngest?
Speaker 1: Yes.  I'm still one of the youngest.  That's why probably I'm still here.  Yes, I did.  I went in on my eighteenth birthday.  I came out on my twenty-first birthday.  But I graduated when I was nineteen years old.  Can you imagine the government giving a nineteen-year-old, immature (laughter), wild, somewhat wild, individual one of these, which would multimillion dollars today, but they were only hundreds of dollars--only thousands, tens of thousands back in those days.  I often thought about that, you know, giving me this airplane, this fighter plane to fly.  But I had no problem with that.  Graduated.  What I alluded to, and this is an observation on my part and it concerns basically the single-engine class.  Everybody did not get commissioned, did not get to be a commissioned officer in the class.  Only four of my fighter pilot classmates became commissioned officers.  The rest were appointed flight officers.  This is the same thing as the [U.S.] Navy--the [U.S.] Army's warrant officer, the Navy has a comparable grade.  You're not a commissioned officer.  You can go from there later on.  So but there were only four in my class who were commissioned.  And the thing that I observed was, they all look like me, all four of them.  And I know that there were guys in my class who were far better, were more mature, far better suited to be leaders, to be commissioned officers than I was, who had dark skin.  And that's something that has kind of stuck with me through the years.  Was it a coincidence?  Quite possibly.  Could possibly have been.  But when I look at the multi-engine class, I see somewhat the same thing, okay, without calling names.  Some of the people you know.  And I'll mention that later in another text.  One of my classmates was Larry Roberts [Lawrence E. Roberts], who's Robin Roberts' father.  See, he was my classmate.  He was a multi-engine pilot.  Roberts passed earlier this year.  But this was an observation that did not escape me.  So I had to think--I don't--I'm not looking back at other classes, because I don't have a corollary.  I don't have--I didn't look at anybody else in that vein.  I just--in just looking at my class is what I saw.  And I thought that was unfair, unusual, because I know that there were young men in my class who were--I don't think anybody was a better pilot than I was, but there certainly were more mature and better leaders than I could have hoped to be.
Story_ID: 313699
Speaker 1: So what happened when you graduated flight school in 1944?
Speaker 2: I graduated [from the Civilian Pilot Training Program]. I--we did ten hours of transition before we left in the P-40 [Curtiss P-40 Warhawk].  This was my first--my first venture into the fighter airplane of my choice.  This airplane I knew about.  Okay.  From even when I first started thinking about--when I first took the exam, then I began to look at it.  I knew that our guys were flying this P-40, so I fell in love with the P-40.  The Flying Tigers, Chennault [Claire Lee Chennault] and Colonel Cochran [Philip Cochran] over in China were flying--the P-40s is the one with the hawk nose--with the shark nose.  So I was--this was, you know, the highlight of my life, you know.  I could have died and gone to heaven now and I would have been happy.  I got to fly the P-40.  There were some other--there was another (unclear) at that time.  I loved P-40--now, you get in this airplane the first time, and you don't have an instructor.  We've got--we had all the pre-ground instrument memorization, you know, your orientation, all the flight manual that tells you all the things you need to know, that you have to--you know, it's easy to memorize now because you just carry over from what you did before and (unclear) you did before.  But when I started flight training, I had a--the word fails me right now that I want to--a person who I looked up to.
Speaker 1: A mentor.
Speaker 2: There you go.  He wasn't really a mentor, he was an idol, you know.  He was someone that I--he was, at that time, the greatest black fighter pilot that I knew of.  He came out of St. Louis [Missouri].  His name was Wendell O. Pruitt.
Speaker 1: What was his last name?
Speaker 2: Wendell O. Pruitt.  Pruitt has--there's some history that goes with Wendell, too.  Anyway, when I--Wendell--I carried Wendell all--as my idol all through my training, you know, never thinking I'd ever see him until I got overseas.  And it just so happens, Wendell was rotated back to the states during my transition period.  I had always--my ambition had been to buzz the Tuskegee Airfield [Tuskegee Army Airfield; Sharpe Field, Tuskegee, Alabama] in a P-40, which was not something you do, you know.  It's not--I had been doing things I shouldn't all along and gotten away with them.  But this was not something you should do.  But it just so happened the last flight we take, we take it with a combat veteran.  I got to--Wendell had got to be my combat veteran who would lead the flight.  Freddie Pendleton [Frederick Pendleton], my buddy; Henry Moore, my buddy; and Clarence Shivers, my other buddy, we all got to be in this flight with Wendell.  Look, I'm in heaven now.  And I told Wendell what my ambitions were, you know, what I like, what I really wanted to do.  And he said to me, "No," he said, "We can't do that.  That's against the rules.  We'd get into a world of trouble."  "Okay," I said.  He was right.  You know, I'll settle for that.  But when you're flying formation, you got a four-shift formation, you have the leader and you have his wing--first element, you have his wingman; second element and his wingman.  So you fly in a four-shift like, so.  And so--and I'm flying the second element.  So I'm looking right at Wendell sitting up there.  And when you fly in formation, you don't see anything else.  All you see is the airplane that you're flying on.  You don't take your eyes off that airplane.  You don't look to see where you are or anything else.  All you ever see is the airplane whose wing you're flying on, because you're close to be--and the potential for an accident is too great.  You have to be very alert in what you're doing.  So I'm standing there watching Wendell.  We fly around, we have a great old time.  You get ready to come back to the field, I hear Wendell call the tower and get landing instructions, you know.  And we're going in to land.  I can tell, you know, things are happening, we're going in to land.  But we don't put our gear down, you know.  We don't in to land and we don't put the gear down.  So I'm waiting for Wendell to give us a signal to put gear down and I don't hear it.  Pretty soon I hear the tower saying, "Flight so and so and so and so, you're a little low."  He said, "Flight so and so and so and so, you can't come across the field."  I don't hear any communication from Wendell.  But next thing I know, we are going down the runway at Tuskegee a few feet off the ground with the engines practically wide open.  I'm telling you, I've never in my life felt--you know, I just--the flush just came up, you know.  I had succeeded in my ambition to do that.  And, then turn around and came in and landed, nothing was ever said about it.  But I got to--Wendell was the pilot overseas to sink or destroy you.  The only time in the history of aviation that a fighter plane has sunk or destroy you, Wendell and another guy by the name of Preston [William Preston] did it.  So, and that's Wendell's claim to fame.  He was an exceptional pilot.  Good record.  Got killed at Tuskegee--after he got back from service he got killed at Tuskegee.
Speaker 1: What do you mean he got killed?
Speaker 2: He was--went up in an AT-6 on Moton Field [Tuskegee, Alabama] with the mechanic in the back seat, and I have no idea what happened.  But Wendell came across the field about five hundred feet, tried to do a roll and ended up upside down.  I'm not sure whether the mechanic--I'm not sure somebody didn't mess with the controls or do something or he didn't have a problem.  He was too good a pilot to have something like that happen to him.  I know that.  He was too good for that.  Something had to be wrong.  But that was not long after I got home, you know.  That was early, early--before the services were desegregated.
Story_ID: 313700
Speaker 1: Where am I now?  I just took fighter transition.  I came home for a couple of weeks, and I'm--this is where part of my--I got--to get home I had to get to Montgomery Field [Maxwell Field; Maxwell Air Force Base, Montgomery, Alabama], and there was a flight, a military flight out that was going to take me to Los Angeles [California].  And I had rode the train from Chehaw [Alabama] to Montgomery [Alabama].  I got off the train at the great big train station at Chehaw, and I don't know where the station is, you know.  I get off the train, I'm in the wrong--I'm in the front section of it, you know, and the train backed in, so the station is probably way over here someplace; I don't know where the station is.  So I'm walking down the platform, kind of get a feel for where the station is, and some guy, a white guy, sweeping the platform says, "Hey, boy."  You know, here I'm an officer with my wings, you know, all my--I'm feeling pretty proud, and to have this guy--and I didn't really take--I didn't really make an issue out of it, 'cause I was kind of used to this sort of thing.  So it really didn't settle.  But it--I noted it, you know.  "Hey, boy.  You looking for the station?"  "Yeah."  "Well, it's that way."  So I went.  Incidents like that occur, you know.  I go to California and I'm walking down the street.  I'm the, probably the only black officer with wings in the State of California at the time--I say that facetiously 'cause I'm sure there was somebody someplace else--and I'm walking down the street in my hometown.  Policemen who were in the station, when I was a Boy Scout where I had scout meetings, are stopping me on the street because they think I'm impersonating an officer, you know.  I explained who I am and I can give them enough information about the area that they'd know I belonged there, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.  They're not sure I belong in the uniform, but they're content, you know, that at least I belong in the area.
Story_ID: 313701
Speaker 1: That takes me to--once we got back to Tuskegee [Alabama]--we didn't go back to Tuskegee, excuse me.  We then went to fighter transition at Walterboro, South Carolina, where we were gonna get our turn.  We still going overseas, now.  At this point, we're still scheduled to go overseas.
Speaker 2: You're scheduled to go overseas to actually fly?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Scheduled to go overseas.  They're still taking replacements over at this point in time.
Speaker 2: Now, do you know what black pilots at the time were over there flying?
Speaker 1: Do I know what?  How many or what?
Speaker 2: How many, yeah.  Like a number or--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  About 450.
Speaker 2: About 450.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  You know, there's so much to this story, Shawn [Shawn Wilson], that I could tell you, like, when Bill Davis [Benjamin O. Davis, Jr.] went over with the 99th [99th Pursuit Squadron]; how he came back, picked up the other three groups, the 100th, the 301st and 302nd; formed the 332nd Fighter Group; went back over, picked up the 99th; went into Ramitelli, Italy [to Ramitelli Airfield]; the black Air Force was now born.  You know, these are--this is kind of a quick version of a long story.  But they were still in--at this point in time, they were in Italy, and they were doing very well, you know.  The story of the black Air Force is another three hours, so I'm not gonna try to take you to that particularly.  But, Walterboro, South Carolina, we were doing fighter transition; learning to fly the P-40 [Curtiss P-40 Warhawk].  Fighter pilots come back overseas.  Veterans come back overseas to help train us.  And about the time we were at Walterboro, it was decided--and we're about three classes: my class, the class behind me, and the class ahead of me; we're all there.  So it was about three classes that did not get to go up to this point.  They decided that we were not gonna to go to Europe.  We were not gonna go overseas, which they didn't need.  You know, the war [World War II, WWII] was about to end.  In another couple of months the war was gonna end in Europe.  And they pretty much had that figured.  So they decided that we were not gonna go to Europe.  So they would change our airplanes, change our tactics, meld us in with the bomber group; which they had a bomber group, the 477th Bomber Group, which takes me that Freeman Field incident [at Freeman Army Airfield, Jackson County, Indiana] I mentioned before at Godman Field, Kentucky [Godman Army Airfield, Fort Knox, Kentucky].  So we changed venues.  We went from Walterboro to Godman Field, Fort Knox.  We changed airplanes from the P-40 to the P-47 [Republic P-47 Thunderbolt], which was--we're now slated to go to the Pacific with the 477th Bombardment Group, which is flying B-25s.
Story_ID: 313702
Speaker 1: At the present time, they were under--they were under--I'm not sure if--no.  I think B.O. Davis [Benjamin O. Davis, Jr.] had come back and was now part of the--he was now in charge of the 477th [477th Bombardment Group] at Godman Field, Kentucky [Godman Army Airfield, Fort Knox, Kentucky].  But, prior to that, these fellas had been in Kentucky, but they had some kind of problems, so they moved them to Freeman Field [Freeman Army Airfield, Jackson County, Indiana].  Freeman Field, Indiana, had a white colonel who decided that all these officers were trainees.  They could not frequent the white house--I mean, frequent the officer's club.  A big brouhaha ensued.  A lot of things happened (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This is the Freeman Field mutiny?
Speaker 1: Freeman Field mutiny.  Yeah.  And that's a story in itself.
Speaker 2: Right.  Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna to try to take you through that.  But anyway, it ended up with a lot of court marshals, they came back to Godman Field, and that's when we joined them, excuse me, when Ben Davis became our commander officer.  Now the war [World War II, WWII] ends in Europe.
Speaker 2: But before--but just to give people some idea of what the Freeman Field mutiny was.
Speaker 1: Freeman Field, you got a bunch of educated officers, who are tired of being second-class citizens, who decided they were not going to tolerate segregation anymore on an air base.  "We are just as good as anybody here.  You've got an officer's club."  Not only that, and I'm not sure if it was Title 18 that the government had passed, which said you could not segregate people of like rank and position on a base.  Okay.  And, of course, they got away with this by either not putting you on the base in the first place, or like, why, you're a trainee and all the officers were white, so they only got to frequent the officer's club.  Up to this point, they'd successful had done it.  But a group of the guys got together, and they decided they were going to infiltrate the officer's club.  The colonel got wind of it and brought the provost marshal out and they staged barriers.  And, of course, it ensued the--everybody went in fours; all the guys went in fours, tried to get in, they were all turned back.  A couple of guys decided they weren't gonna be turned back.  They brushed the provost marshal aside and went inside the building.  And those were the ones who eventually got court-marshaled--four of them, I think; I'm not sure if I get this story exactly right, but four of them got court-marshaled.  Three of them got exonerated a long time ago.  The last one, this is a felony conviction.  This guy went to law school and couldn't be a lawyer because he had a felony conviction.  But Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] pardoned him.  You recall this?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: His name was Bill Terry [Roger "Bill" Terry].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And Bill Terry, four or five years ago, Bill Clinton--no, more than four or five--seven or eight years ago--Bill Clinton finally pardoned the last of the Freeman Field people.
Story_ID: 313703
Speaker 1: Getting back to Godman Field, Kentucky [Godman Army Airfield, Fort Knox, Kentucky].  We no longer were slated to go to Europe.  Now we have a September schedule to do to the Pacific as a composite group, the 99th Fighters Squadron [99th Pursuit Squadron], which I was a member, and the 447th Composite Group.  We get into the July timeframe, it's obvious the bomb has dropped now, it's obvious the war [World War II, WWII] is ending in Japan--in the Pacific.  So they signed the surrender in August, I guess, formally in September.  September, the first part of September we were supposed to go--but now we have no place to go.  There is no war, you know; there's no place for us to go.  So they relocated us to Columbus, Ohio, to Lockbourne Air Force Base [Rickenbacker Air National Guard Base] in Columbus, Ohio, and then we began to disband.  The first part of '46 [1946], all the flight officers were let go.
Speaker 2: So you never make it out of the United States?
Speaker 1: Never made it out of the United States. Yeah.  First part of the year, the flight officers were all dismissed.  In June of '46 [1946], all but the chosen few build--a skeleton crew of mostly of guys who came back from overseas, not even all of them were made, were kept as a group.  Everybody else was discharged for the good of the service.  And that ended my [U.S.] military career.
Speaker 2: In what year did you--what year was that?
Speaker 1: That was June of '46 [1946].
Speaker 2: You go back to California?
Speaker 1: Go back to California.
Speaker 2: You have a G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944]?
Speaker 1: No.  I go back to California.  I don't do anything with the G.I. Bill.  I'm engaged to be married in a year or so.  So I'm trying to find a job, which is very hard to do.  I get a job as a furniture salesman for two or three months.  And then the most educated people at this time were in the post office. All of the doctors, the lawyers and your know, people like that. All the educated people were in the post office.  So I went to the post office.  And I stayed in the post office for, actually altogether probably nine years.  But now I'm, you know, in 1950 I get married, I've got a family coming up, so my wage earning capability has increased as my family increases.  So I worked a whole bunch of jobs.  I worked the post office in the daytime, I worked at North American [North American Airlines]--I mean I worked at the post office at night, I worked at North American in the daytime, and I served (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What did you do at North American?
Speaker 1: --in El Segundo [California].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I had started at North American when I got out of high school [David Starr Jordan High School, Los Angeles, California].  I had a couple of months at North American before I went into the service--or a month.  So I was familiar with North American.  But anyway, I would work nights in the post office, it was easy to do, and days at North American; and on weekends--and so I'd do parties.  And that helped me get my family--I got a house, you know.  My kids--every two years I got another one coming.  So my family begins to grow.
Story_ID: 313704
Speaker 1: And when I start at the airport, when I start at the airport, one of my comrades out of the bomb group by the name of Paul Anderson, had gone out to the Compton airport [Compton/Woodley Airport, Compton, California], and he bought an airplane, a little Aeronca Chief, and was doing a little moonlighting teaching.  And I happened to go out there one day just to see airplanes and I ran into Paul.  He took me up in this little Aeronca Chief and let me fly.  And it just beat the heck out of me.  The challenge was back, you know.  I just loved the smell of the airplane, the sound of the engine, the feel.  Everything was just--you know, I'm back in heaven again.  So Paul talked, he said, "Well, why don't you get an airplane, you know, and we'll get together and we'll do a little something here."  Well, you couldn't--black people, well, you see, just couldn't go on any airport.  You weren't accepted at just about any airport you wanted.  This was a rare airport with a rare owner by the name of Earl Woodley, who was only interested in business.  He couldn't care less what your color was or anything else.  If you paid the rent, you were all right with Earl Woodley.  He was a good--he was a great man.  Anyway, I read about it in a paper, somebody had two Aeroncas in a basket some place in North Hollywood [Los Angeles, California], $250.  I didn't have $250.  Strange thing, I had been serving parties for a man by the name of Fritch--white man by the name of Fritchy [ph.], John, I think was his name or his kid was named John, who took a liking to me.  I served all of his parties.  He was an executive with Technicolor Corporation [Technicolor Motion Picture Corporation; Technicolor, Inc.] out in Hollywood, very nice man.  I called Mr. Fritchy up and I said, "You know, I hate to do this because it's, you know, but I need some money.  I need $250.  Could you loan me $250?"  He says, "No."  He says, "I won't loan it to you.  I'll give it to you."  He says, "I don't want to strain our friendship with a loan."  He says, "If you ever get in a position to pay me back, fine.  If you don't, fine."  Picked up the $250, went and bought these Aeroncas, took them home in Compton [California] in my garage.  Never built anything other than models up to this point.  I built--I rebuilt the first one.  Beautiful airplane.  Took it out to Compton, checked it out, flew it and went into business.  Paul and I are parked side by side now, each of us are teaching.
Story_ID: 313705
Speaker 1: Just to get all of that story in, you were talking about the white volunteers.  Well, not volunteers, but the white instructors who were at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Army Airfield; Sharpe Field, Tuskegee, Alabama], because--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --we were rolling, just so that it makes sense to go on.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That's something I think needs to be explained.  We were very, very good.  We were very, very good for a number of reasons:  one is, only the best of us were allowed to proceed in the first place; secondly, all of the people who taught us were dedicated to making us the best that we could be.  Our black instructors were for reasons--for ethnic reasons, maybe; our white instructors were for dedication.  I can't really speak for what it was.  But they were determined that we were going to get the best training and that we were going to be the best pilots that we could possibly be.  We didn't have anybody dealing us short in our instructional group.
Story_ID: 313706
Speaker 1: So we're in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], you and Paul [Paul Anderson] have identical planes (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Parked side by side.
Speaker 2: This goes on.  I build a second airplane, I take it out to the airport, and Paul and I decide to go into business together, rent a hanger [at Compton/Woodley Airport, Compton, California], you know.  This is unheard of in the--except in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: What year is this now?
Speaker 2: This is '55 [1955].
Speaker 1: Fifty-five [1955].
Speaker 2: So Woodley [Earl Woodley] agrees to give us--to rent us a hanger.  We got a beautiful hanger.  He and I went into business.  B 'n Air Service [ph.], Burns and Anderson; and we stayed together for about a year.  And it was kind of a complicated thing.  We didn't have one business that we were partners in.  We had two businesses competing in the same hanger, which is very difficult to do.  So at the end of about a year, we decided it was best that we went our separate ways.  So, since he had been there first, he kept this hanger, I went to Woodley and got another hanger, and I started Rusty's Flying Service two or three hangers down.  And that went from '55 [1955] to 1970.  And I had a very good career.  I quit the post office when went into business on the airport.  But I still worked some part time.  I still worked somewhat at North American [North American Airlines].  I eventually had to quit North American and work full time at the airport because the business grew, you know.  I had really a tremendous business, therefore (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who were you teaching?
Speaker 2: --like ten years.  Huh?
Speaker 1: Who were you teaching?  Who were your students?
Speaker 2: Everybody.  White, blacks, males, females.  There was no--I had probably as many white students as I had black ones.
Speaker 1: Probably didn't start out that way, though.
Speaker 2: Yes.  It did.
Speaker 1: Did it?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It started out that way.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Because '55 [1955] was a big year.  Rosa Parks.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But we weren't having (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You were removed from--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But, I mean, like, because Rosa Parks was in '55 [1955]; also, Emmett Till.  That stuff was happening in the South.  Were you pretty far removed from that being in the West?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.  We had black guys going to the white schools, and white guys coming to the black schools.  It was either whose price or whose or who, you know, whoever you took a liking to, see.  Well, I had probably all together, maybe probably around five hundred students, that's in my years there.  So I did not have a problem with discrimination or bias in business that I know of.  My instructors, I had three or four instructors, they were all white.  The only black instructor I had took up next door and started his own business, see.  So--and there weren't too many black instructors to begin with.  Not a lot of our guys come out of Tuskegee [Tuskegee Army Airfield; Sharpe Field, Tuskegee, Alabama] took to aviation for some reason, you know.  I was surprised that probably in L.A., and I'm sure this is in other--not another one of our guys that I know of ever had got in an airplane again, you know.  There's a lot of ties there.  I'm sure that may not be exactly true, but I don't know of any who did, you know. No guys who kept their license current.
Story_ID: 313707
Speaker 1: So you ran your business [Rusty's Flying Service] from '55 [1955] to '70 [1970]? Seventy [1970] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Seventy [1970].  Yeah.  Things got a little weak in '70 [1970], and I went out and got another job, kept the business, and eventually I sold--about 1971, I sold the business.  I got an offer for a private sector that I couldn't refuse, which was the beginning of my career, my career success story in the private sector.
Speaker 1: And what was that?
Speaker 2: I went to--I had a student who was an engineer, black guy, worked for Teledyne [Teledyne Technologies, Inc.] had a program that they were having problems with.  Teledyne being an electronics firm, they were doing an IHAS [Integrated Helicopter Avionics System] program where they were putting electronics in a helicopter, CH-46 helicopter [CH-46 Sea Knight].  And they were having problems, because they were not a mechanical company, see.  Well, I had been building airplanes at the airport and the guy knew that, so he told them about me, they called me up.  They had this program where Boeing [The Boeing Company] had contracted them to modify this helicopter.  And they were having trouble doing the modifications and keeping it structurally sound.  So Boeing said either you get somebody in here who knows how to build airplanes or we're going to take this someplace else.  So they called me, and I took my mechanic and I went over there.  And we worked two weeks rehashing what--the problems that they had, and they liked it; more than liked it.  So at some point in time, Boeing, a fella by the name of John Deardorff said--and I'm assuming this is the way this worked, I wasn't involved in it.  But all of a sudden we were told that--and we were being paid an exceptional--
Speaker 1: Handsomely (laughter).
Speaker 2: --handsomely.  Thank you.  We were being reimbursed handsomely for our service.  And because we were working, like, from dawn 'til twelve o'clock at night (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, were you working for Boeing directly?
Speaker 2: We were working for Teledyne.
Speaker 1: Teledyne.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We were working for (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How do you spell that?  T-E--
Speaker 2: T-E-L-E-Y (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) D-I--go ahead.
Speaker 2: Let me see.  Teledyne.  T-E-L-D-Y-N-E.  T-E-L-E-D-Y-N-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that--you started in 1971 (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This--that firm is still in existence today.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you went to them in 1971?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-one [1971].  Yeah.  January 1--January 2, 1971.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Anyway, we--they, like, so Harold Davis was the guy I took with me; he was a kid I brought up.  And I took Harold with me.  We went over there and we began to straighten out the things that they had, and they decided to keep us, and still being reimbursed handsomely for what we were doing.   It was a year program.  We did what we had to do, got it finished, ten months.  And Boeing came and took the machine and went away.  The program was over, so they were basically through with us.  We stayed another month to kind of clean up the loose ends.  But like in November of '71 [1971], we were finished with that.  I had sold the airplane business, so I'm out of work for a month.  In the meantime, I went to work for a few weeks at a machine shop doing machining, which I had learned a little bit about at North American [North American Airlines].
Story_ID: 313708
Speaker 1: But I think it was early 1972, I went to North American [North American Airlines] where I had worked before several times.  And they offered me a job as a buyer at a reasonable salary, which is enough for me to live comfortably on, so I decided to take it.  And I did.  I didn't stay at--that was El Segundo [California].  I didn't stay there very long because my Tuskegee Airman background seemed to open doors.  Didn't open them at the airlines, but in the private section it seemed to open doors for me.
Speaker 2: And I want you to speak to why you think that was.  Is it because everyone realized that the training was so good?
Speaker 1: I--no.  I think it had something to do with affirmative action and the fact that I was unique in the group, a unique group.  A lot of these guys were military pilots who knew a little bit about the Tuskegee Airmen or the black pilots of World War II [WWII].  Some of them had some prior knowledge.  So I can only guess, I can only speculate that that had something to do with it.  While I was there, there was a senior or director or a buyer who became familiar with me, who later moved to Rocketdyne [Aerojet Rocketdyne] in Canoga Park [Los Angeles, California] as the director of material for the division, for the Rocketdyne Division.  And when I heard he was there, I went out to him and I said, "You need somebody here."  He snapped me right up, brought me in as a senior buyer.  Very shortly from senior buyer, he made me a manager over warehousing of some portion of his team, and he just brought me up.  I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What-
Speaker 1: --he had to fight battles, but he brought me up.  He was a mentor, okay.
Speaker 2: What was his name again?
Speaker 1: His name was Bob Odom [ph.].  And Bob Odom, I can safely say, I probably would've gone nowhere if it were not for Bob Odom.  And later on, another guy that we--that was a part of the group who I, who I, I need to mention the people who's helped me to succeed.  I was very successful at Rocketdyne. Very (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Rocketdyne.
Speaker 1: Rocketdyne.  Very successful.  R-O-C-K-E-T-D-Y-N-E.  And the people there were very good.  North American has always--you know, I have a warm place for North American and Rockwell [North American Rockwell Corporation], because they always supported me and did their role by me.
Speaker 2: What year did you start with Bob Odom at Rocketdyne?
Speaker 1: Seventy-four [1974], 1974.  And I stayed there until I retired.  No, excuse me.  I stayed there until '86 [1986], '87 [1987]; '86 [1986], I believe.  And I left--I developed a program for the corporation of travel, travel services.  This is another story that would become involved, so I'm not going to get into that.  It had to do with the government being dissatisfied with the perks that the traveler was getting as a result of air travel. Air mileage, gifts, you know, and the government's paying for this.  This is a government program, the government is paying for it, and the employees are reaping the rewards.  And it became a technical controversy as to how to handle this.  And along with some other people, some other managers in the business, we developed a program which the government bought.  We said to the government in essence, if we control the travel so that they are not taking circuitous routes in order to enhance their mileage and this sort of thing, you shouldn't care whether they get flying, because they're not gonna get that many miles.  We're gonna make sure they go the shortest distance for the cheapest price.  Okay.  And the government bought that.  So we developed this program for the whole corporation, for all of Rockwell, all of their divisions.  And it was centered in the El Segundo office under the guy that I was reporting to, was director of material in the corporate office.  This is corporate now.  This is not division.  This is the whole corporation.  His name was Bob Peterson [ph.].  And Bob Peterson was a mentor as much as Bob Odom, you know, for the short period of time, he was a mentor, also a pilot.  All these guys are pilots, mind you.  See.  Bob was in the [U.S.] Navy.  Bob was in the [U.S.] Marines [U.S. Marine Corps].  Peterson had an airplane; oh, I don't know what he did in the service, but he had an airplane and he flew all the time that we were working together.  He did a lot of flying.  He was an enthusiast.  But I have to say that these people were very helpful for me; getting out of the business, getting out of the private sector.  I retired in 1988 very well, very comfortable.  They did very well by me.  Today I live very comfortable because of the benefits and because of the--what happened with North American, Rockwell and now Boeing [The Boeing Company].
Story_ID: 313709
Speaker 1: And that brings me up to, you know, maybe my kids.  You never did get too much of my family.  But my children, I have four kids, all of whom have graduated from college.  Every one of my kids are college graduates.  My young son has a master's degree.  So I'm very proud of my kids.  They're all successful in business--not in business for themselves--Khep [HistoryMaker Khephra Burns] is in business for himself.  Michael [Michael Burns] is in business for himself for the most part.
Speaker 2: What does Michael do?
Speaker 1: Michael is--you know, that's a good question.  I don't know how I can describe what Michael does, but Michael is a computer analyst or a computer instructor or a computer trainee.  Michael teaches computer applications at Stanford University [Stanford, California].  Okay.  He teaches computer--he travels all over the country sometimes as a--for a firm giving seminars on computer applications, computer usage, computer understanding.  It all has to do with computers.  And since I am not what you might call computer literate, I will refrain from trying to explain it to you.  My wife [Treneta Davis Burns] could probably explain it better than I can.  I can't.  But he does very well with it--with his.
Speaker 2: So that's your two sons.  And your two daughters?
Speaker 1: My--I have a daughter who is a computer engineer for a software maker who does--or software maker who does workmen's compensation databases or software.  And she does customer relations.  They sell the software and if people have a problem, they call Vicki [Vicki Burns].  That's my oldest girl.  My youngest girl [Cheryl Burns] is--she is the, she is the mathematics genius.  She is like director of financing for what used to be BP Amoco [BP Amoco Corporation; BP Corporation North America Inc.], which began to be ChoicePoint, which was just bought out by somebody else recently.  And what she does is, she controls the flow of money between the merchants and the cardholders--yeah.  The merchants and the cardholders.  I think that best describes--that's the one that just went out the door recently.  And she's doing very well where she is.
Speaker 2: So we didn't--I mean, now that we've gotten sort of the meat and potatoes, we can talk about the--sort of your social life in a way.  When did you meet your wife?  How did you meet her?
Speaker 1: I met my wife in college at Pepperdine [George Pepperdine College; Pepperdine University, Malibu, California].
Story_ID: 313710
Speaker 1: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And we didn't talk about that, really.  But you received the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944] or somehow you--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I went to Pepperdine [George Pepperdine College; Pepperdine University, Malibu, California] on a G.I. Bill for three years, see.  And then when the opportunity came to start the flying business [Rusty's Flying Service], I dumped school, which was a dumb thing to do, and I went full time--'cause my thinking was at the time, if I'm gonna be this big-time airplane businessman, I don't need a college education, which was not the smartest thing I ever did.  And I've often thought of going back, and I've often thought of going back until I got too old to really do it.  And I was so excited--and I was so successful in the private sector.  That was another thing.  At times I thought I should go back then, because I had reached a level--I could have gone much further if I had had college education.  I could've gone on much further.
Speaker 2: You think it held you back?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm sure it did.  They did all they could for me with what I had, you know.  Had I a college education--I give you an example.  The guy who was president of Boeing [The Boeing Company] for a short period of time recently--his name is James Bell [James A. Bell].  James Bell and I came up together in the Rockwell [North American Rockwell Corporation] family.  James had the education.  Corporate recognized him right off, took him in the office, groomed him, brought him back to Rocketdyne [Aerojet Rocketdyne, Canoga Park, California], put him in a position and then he just went from there.  James is very, very good at what he does.  And he went to Boeing.  He came up--when Boeing bought out, he became vice president and controller at Boeing; went to Washington as vice president, and then CFO of Boeing.  When that fiasco started at Boeing, they moved him up to the president for a few months while they searched for a president.  James said he didn't want to be president.  But this is the kind of path that James got that was available to me, because the same people who were moving him were moving me.  But not having, not having the degree, it had an effect on high I could go.  I could have gone much higher had I had a degree.
Story_ID: 313711
Speaker 1: You said you and your wife [Treneta Davis Burns] married in what year then?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty [1950].
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty [1950].
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty [1950].
Speaker 1: And did so out in California?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  We did so.  You know, this is something.  We were going to school, you know.  And I had been married before and divorced.  I really wasn't looking forward to getting married again, but we were going to school and we had all this--we had things in common, you know, the things we had in common; and she was just, you know, for me being who I was and what I was, she was just a perfect match.  And so we got married, and then along comes family, you know, and family and family and family; which I wanted to be a parent, okay.  I didn't have any education as a parent, so I wanted to be a parent.  I was very proud to be a father.  It took me a little while to learn how, but I was very proud to be a father.  And I've always, always been proud to be a--you know, to this day I'm proud of my kids.  You know, when I look at them, I see an accomplishment for the most part.  I see some success that might not have been otherwise.
Story_ID: 313712
Speaker 1: So, this part of the interview we'll sort of--we can talk about philosophy; sort of your ideas and just what you think about black issues, I'll say.
Speaker 2: Oh, of course.  Coming up in the South, I naturally got a sour taste about race relations, okay, because I only saw the bad.  There was a little good, but one percent maybe; 99 percent of it was bad.  Strangely enough I come into the private sector, to the world, to start a business.  And my associates, my students, my friends are white, because they fly.  They play golf.  They do things that I do, and they are more attached to me than me attached to them.  They more or less came to me and it just evolved.  We developed--I developed a friend, a very close friend, who was a wealthy man; had an airplane; kind of taught him a little bit about flying; kept him alive for a while; brought him through all of this, all of this aviation; and he ended up a very, very, good pilot; very good pilot.  His name is Ed Rysner [ph.].  Ed Rysner was another mentor, you know.  He was--when I got in trouble, Ed always raised the rent.  He paid me for my airplane--for his airplane.  But I got in trouble.  Ed always needed something done to his airplane.  Ed never went any place without me. And Treneta.  Okay.  He had a--let's say, kind of a safety valve.  He knew that when I'm sitting alongside of him when he was flying this airplane, he didn't have to worry about nothing.  Anything went wrong, he knew I was sitting there.  If the airplane did something, he didn't worry 'cause I was sitting there.  And this basically--and I'm not sure that that was his conscious reason.  Okay.  But this is, to me, because this has been going on for fifty years now, see.  And we're still the best of friends.  But Ed, because of Ed, I met a couple of other couples who were friends of his, and we all became friends together and we all did things together.  We did our traveling together.  I went to Tahiti with two of them.  We've been to Mexico two or three times a year with each of them, because we had airplanes.  And when I didn't have an airplane, Ed had one.  He--you know.  So flying, golf and a respect for each other developed this close group.  We even have a group.  We are--we formed a club, and there's only the ten of us in this club.  And they're people all over Los Angeles [California] jokingly trying to get into our club.  It's called SVWTBS and CMS, which means Simi Valley Wine Tasting Booze Sampling and (unclear) Marching Society.  This is a big joke, you know.  We have things in place.  We have bumper stickers.  We have a convention, the five of us, every year.  We still get together.  But this was my association.  It wasn't that I excluded anything.  It just was this is the way it gravitated, you know.   Now, we still do the same things.  We still play golf, we still travel.  I know we don't fly anymore.  Ed had a stroke, he can't fly.  I got to the point where I couldn't maintain my airplane anymore, so I decided it's time to get rid of it.  So in June of 2001, I sold my 310.  I had a Cessna 310.  Beautiful Cessna 310.  Loved that airplane.  I regret selling it.  To this day I regret it.  It was the dumbest thing I ever did.  Even if I just sat it someplace and looked at it, you know, because that's been my life, aviation.  So it's difficult for me to--for the last four years without my airplane, or without a airplane.
Story_ID: 313713
Speaker 1: Well, let's speak to modern day aviation.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Are you seeing as many black pilots as you thought you'd see?
Speaker 2: As it should be there?  No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Why is that?
Speaker 2: If we--well, it depends on who you listen to.  If you listen to the airlines, it's because they aren't there--the pool isn't there to draw from.  And to some degree, that's true.  And that's my fault (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What pool are they drawing from?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Huh?  That's my fault.
Speaker 1: What pool are they drawing from?  And how would that be your fault?
Speaker 2: Well, they're basically getting them out of the [U.S.] military, you know, because--well, as a black pilot coming out of the war [World War II, WWII], I did start to train them.  Okay.  Black people in aviation.  But as a Tuskegee Airman, we should have come out of the service and immediately throughout this country, started bringing black youth in aviation.  And we didn't do it.  We didn't do anything for twenty or more years.  And then we did very little after that.  We just recently, Tuskegee Airmen, just recently started.  I started a program in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] about a few years ago, which it's kind of getting started now, training young black youth, male and female.  We had the Air Force Academy [U.S. Air Force Academy, Colorado Springs, Colorado] calling and begging, "Please, find us some people."  The [U.S.] Navy, the [U.S.] Marines [U.S. Marine Corps].  "Please, find us some people, some blacks, some (unclear) youth, so that we can better assimilate them into the military service."  They're not there.  And that's--and I say that's our fault.  All of the Tuskegee Airmen, that's our fault because we should have been the people spearheading just that thing.
Speaker 1: What numbers are we talking about?  Do you have any idea of the numbers (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) One percent.  In aviation today?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: One percent.  Eight- eighty thousand airline pilots--
Speaker 1: Well, that would make aviation--
Speaker 2: --eight thousand of them--
Speaker 1: --pretty white.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry.  Huh?
Speaker 1: That would make aviation pretty white.
Speaker 2: How many pilots have you seen traveling?  You know, I look for black pilots--
Speaker 1: I do, too.  I saw one in the last, like, three years.  I've seen one.
Speaker 2: But there are--there are some out there.  Some of them I know.  I belong to OBAP.  I did until recently, which is the Organization of Airline--of Black Airline Pilots [sic. Organization of Black Airline Professionals].  This is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And how many of you were there?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: How many of you were there in that organization?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm not sure, but I think probably about eight hundred.  There were about eight hundred.  I said eight thousand.  If I said that, I was wrong.  There were about eight hundred, at the time I looked at the numbers several years, black airline pilots, all of which were in OBAP, because you had to be in OBAP.  You had to be in the union.  Let me digress a little bit and tell you something.  When we got out of the service and we tried to get into the airlines, we all thought that American Airlines, United Airlines, TWA [Trans World Airlines]; the airlines themselves were the ones that were keeping us out.  But that's not the case, see.  The truth of the matter is, according to my analysis and my way of thinking was, in order to get a job as an airline--in the airlines, you had to belong to the union.  And the Air Line Pilots Association [Air Line Pilots Association, International] wouldn't accept us.  That's why we could not get into the airlines.  It wasn't as much the airlines--well, they might have been using them as an excuse, I don't know that.  But it wasn't because of the airlines primarily that we didn't get in.  It was because of the Air Lines Pilot Association.  So, when affirmative action came in and the government, having a lot to do with the commercial airlines, and government contracts were available--moving the mail, for example, you had to have affirmative action.  Well, so they started hiring black pilots.  Black pilots not--couldn't get in or not necessarily, I'm not sure they can or can't.  So they formed their own organization.  And they became a union under themselves.  Much the same as the white airline pilots association, there's a black airline pilots association, see.  And when--you asked me how many, there are eighty thousand--a number that I've known--airline pilots in the airline pilots--white airline pilots association.  There are eight hundred in the black airline pilots association, so one percent.  Okay.  That's my recollection as of a few years back.
Speaker 1: And that number you've probably seen going in the opposite direction of the way--I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  I think it's got--I think it's growing.
Speaker 1: It's growing?
Speaker 2: Very, very, very--very minutely, but I think it's growing, because the word is getting out; the guys are going into [U.S.] military service and coming out pilots; and they can jump right into the airlines.  See, they gobble them up.  Any pilot coming out of service can get a job.  That's not a problem.  Then we have the young people who are becoming aware, becoming interested and taking lessons privately, see, and with a desire to get into aviation, much the same as we did.  So I think it's growing, but it's very, very slight.  We have black people--we have a young man, Robin Pettigraves [sic. Robert Petgrave]--I don't know how I remember his name--at the Compton Airport [Compton/Woodley Airport, Compton, California], right where I used to be, who today is mentoring and monitoring black youth.  There's some things happening now.
Story_ID: 313714
Speaker 1: You were telling the story that I'd like for you to repeat, just about the foundation you feel that was there that maybe there were some missed opportunities to build on.
Speaker 2: I think in the first few years after the war [World War II, WWII] when we really didn't have--we didn't have anybody to look to or anybody looking after us, we kind of just went our own ways.  But along about a time frame I believe to be about 1978, a television program called 'We The People,' [ph.] and I'm gonna be remiss if I can't remember all the names, but I do remember Sarah Purcell [ph.], John Barber [ph.]; and if I remember the black kid's name, as I go along I'll try to mention it.  They brought five of our guys on to their program and introduced Tuskegee Airmen to the nation, nationwide television program.  And from that small beginning, it began to swell.  We began to get inquiries for interviews.  We began to get to television programs.  We began to get noticed.  Things began to happen.  People were interested in making movies.  You know, a lot occurred between '78 [1978] and I'll say '91 [1991], when we had the convention in Los Angeles [California] and George Lucas announced that he was going to do the Tuskegee Airmen movie.  Okay.  And at the time, this was probably the height of our momentum.  We should have, just begun at that point, 1991, to build on that, you know.  But we kind of just took things as they came along without going out and constructively building on it.  And it slowly began to diminish.  'The Tuskegee Airmen' movie came out, not by George Lucas, but because Bob Williams [Robert W. Williams] and the people who were supporting him, and I don't--HBO, I guess it was.  The name Cooper [Robert Cooper] rings a bell.  And they did 'The Tuskegee Airmen' movie, which was a great movie.  Great movie.  It was a movie, and it did open the eyes to some of the important things that took place at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Army Airfield; Sharpe Field, Tuskegee, Alabama].  There was a lot of Hollywood in it.  But it was a good enough movie to expose the country to what we--some of what we persevered under at the time.
Speaker 1: Well, let me ask you this.  What do you wish you had done that should be recorded on this tape that may make a difference?
Speaker 2: What I wish I had done?  I wish I had been able to assemble the Tuskegee Airmen organization, give them a purpose for bringing youth in.  I wish I could have succeeded at it.  I tried to do it.  But I wish I could have succeeded at it so the--back when we were in large numbers, we could have developed a program, and we could have done it, that would have brought--that would have exposed more black youths to the field of aviation.
Speaker 1: How are black youths being exposed to aviation today?
Speaker 2: Sparsely.  I'm not sure if that's the word.  I'm not--with the exception of what Pettigrew is doing--Petgrave [Robert Petgrave], excuse me--is doing at Los Angeles [California], and I'm sure that there're other people throughout this nation who are trying to do the same thing that I'm not familiar with, I've either not heard of or have it slipped my mind.  There has to be somebody someplace doing something that I'm not aware of.  But I just heard the other day that of the 996 of us that started out, there's less than two hundred of us left.  So as a group of original Tuskegee Airmen, we are slowly meeting our Maker.  And I'm not sure that we brought in the people to keep us going in perpetuity the way we should have.  I think we're in a period right now of swimming, you know, to keep from drowning.  I think we're in a period where we're trying to swim.  I'm hoping we reach shore.  Okay.  Well, you know, I'm the young one.  I'm eighty years old, and I'm the young one.  Think of the guys who all came ahead of me, you know, that are still alive.  You know, they're in their late eighties and early nineties.  There's not a lot of energy in that group of people.
Story_ID: 313715
Speaker 1: How are you involved with the L.A. [Los Angeles, California] chapter of the Tuskegee Airmen [Tuskegee Airmen, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: For a long time I was an every month meeting member, involved in the day-to-day activity, going to schools and talking to children.  I was involved.  I was president of the chapter in '91 [1991].  I was involved in it to the hilt.  When I moved from L.A. to Palm Desert [California], it was a little bit far to travel.  My health was not the greatest, and I kind of disappeared from it.  I kind of--I'm still a member, but I'm not an active member.
Story_ID: 313716
Speaker 1: Right.  Well, I just had a good idea.  And using--and I'm gonna take just a minute.  But technology's changed now.  So children may have an opportunity to see this who perhaps wouldn't have had an opportunity to see a black--or just anyone black speak about, you know--but, if you--let's say, given the opportunity to speak with the children for ten minutes on a tape that could be used over and over, what sorts of things would you say to them about aviation to inspire them to be involved in it?
Speaker 2: To begin with, my opinion, having done this to some extent, it takes more than ten minutes to convince a black kid to join the field of aviation.  They have no nucleus to come up with.  They have been told about doctors and lawyers and engineers and nurses and all of the professions of the world since they were young.  But nobody has ever instilled the seed of aviation in them.  And you cannot talk to an adolescent, a teenager.  You cannot talk to them about aviation unless you can get them involved in a program where you can give them all the beautiful things that take place, you know.  And you can't do that in ten minutes, you know.  If you could--I wanted to go to schools in the L.A. School District [Los Angeles Unified School District] for free and teach a class, an aeronautics school, the way Mr. Cosgrove [ph.] taught me.  And I would have done it--I would do it for free in order to get kids, young people, interested in the field of aviation.  The white kids, I'm not sure where they get it from.  But they get it, you know.  They come up--there's no shortage of white kids wanting to be in the field of aviation.  But not so for minorities.  Not just blacks.  But also Latinos, you know.  It's the same thing as this.  And there's somewhere in here there's a deficiency, that I cannot necessarily put my finger on.  I'd like to say it was fear in our original--in our genetic makeup, we've always had a fear.  Okay.  Fear of aviation was one of the biggest ones that we had to overcome.  It took me a while to get my mother [Nona Bertrand Burns] in an airplane, you know; a long time before I got my mother in an airplane.  But I think--I'm not sure fear has anything to do with it as a basic, but as an underlying reason it may have something.  But in order to get our kids interested, we have got to have a program of getting a captive audience and getting them to sit down and listen to the fundamentals and the beauty and become enamored with meteorology; to become enamored with the theory of flight; to become enamored with radio communications and navigation and all the elements of aviation, you know.  It is a beautiful profession.  And our kids don't know that.
Story_ID: 313717
Speaker 1: I mean, and this is along the same lines and these are sort of some of the questions we wrap up with.  But what is history to you?
Speaker 2: What is history?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  What does history mean to you?  Why is it important?
Speaker 2: Why is history important?  I'm not sure which history we're getting into (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, I mean--
Speaker 2: Any history?  All history is important, because it contributes to an experience.  All history, you know.  Whether it's ancient history, current history, Tuskegee Airmen history, slave history, civil rights history.  You know, there's all kinds of history, and it's all important because of the lessons we should learn from it, see.  And that's where our falling is, we didn't learn from our history the things that we did to get what we got.  It didn't come easy, you know.  We had a lot of help.  And we did not take that--take the benefit of what somebody did for us and then do it for somebody else.  We didn't pass along the help.  That's what we didn't do.  We did not pass along the help.  We got an awful lot of help.  And we did not pass it along.  We became individuals, went our own separate ways.  I don't know whether we didn't visualize.  There are other elements of why Tuskegee Airmen evolved.  Some of it was because of the love of flying.  Some of it was because the early folk, being educated, mature, looking at going to war, sleeping in mud, being used as cannon fodder.  You know, all these non--some of those guys were smart enough to see this as an opportunity--this is my opinion, mind you; not necessarily based on any fact--not seeing an opportunity to separate themselves from the ugliness of war and get into the beauty of war, be well educated, had to be in--being very capable people, this was an opportunity for them, see.  I don't think Bill Davis [Benjamin O. Davis, Jr.] came into this for his own choosing.  I think Bill Davis was chosen.  And being the leader and being the man that he was, he assumed the responsibility for something, and I don't think he really a great deal of--initially had a great deal of interest in.  But I can't say enough for his role in our group.  But I think a lot of our guys went into this not necessarily for the love of flying.  A lot of our guys went into this flying these great big massive airplanes with two thousand horsepower engines and going four hundred miles an hour, who could not see themselves coming out of the service, getting into a sixty-five horsepower cup, you know.  This just did not--it just did nothing for their ego, you know.  It didn't make them feel good.  I did.  They didn't.  So I think a lot of the reasons we got out of the service--I say we, Tuskegee Airmen--got out of the [U.S. military] service and did nothing was, one: because it was not loved in the first place; and secondly, because we don't see going down to something less than what we had.  Now that is a philosophy that espoused by me and me alone.  I would not like to blame that on anyone else in the world.  But this has been the thought in my mind for a number of years, to try to explain why we didn't go into aviation.  Why weren't more of us pilots?  I know why we didn't get in the airlines.  That's obvious.  But I'm not sure many of us even tried that, tried to get into the airlines.  I'm not certain about that, you know.  I don't know of too many.  They just--I could find very little interest in aviation, and I think that is probably the primary reason we did not take the opportunity to advance the cause.
Story_ID: 313718
Speaker 1: One story I want to go back to that we didn't manage to get in was the Watts riots, because you said that there were stories about your airfield.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It's not a big story.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it did something for me.  When the riots started [in Watts, Los Angeles, California]--and now, I've got a lot of white people; I've got a lot of airplanes, very expensive airplanes in my hangar and parked in front of--I had planes.  I had fifteen of my own, you know.  So when the riots started and the burning started, we had to do something.  So all--a lot of my students, a lot of the people who flew with me, I got each--"Everybody, take one of my airplanes or take one of somebody's airplanes and take it over to Torrance [California]," where they would be protected.  So I cleared out every airplane that I had that could fly.  Now, there were some in the hangar that I was building.  There was a 310 [Cessna 310] in the hangar; a very expensive airplane that I made a belly landing, that I was rebuilding, that I couldn't fly out, see.  And you're anticipating that this burning and looting is going to continue.  So I have some white friends that were close to me, came and got my kids, see.  They came and they got my kids.  My wife [Treneta Davis Burns] stayed home, but they came and got my kids and took them to the white neighborhoods where down in Downey [California] and other places where they were.  My kids were with them.  Well, I was left with just me and my wife was home, we was okay.  And the hangar with the airplanes that were being rebuilt, well, I couldn't fly out.  And I'm thinking, you know, I might have a problem here.  So I had a--I'm not one for guns.  I've never been gun person.  But I had--somebody had given me a gun for--what's the word I want--collateral.  Okay.  And I stuck it in my safe.  Dirty little snub nose .38 automatic.  And I never had any use for it.  I hoped one day they'd come and get the darn thing, you know.  I don't have any use for guns.  But this one--at the height of the riot, I'm thinking, somebody's gonna come here and burn my hangar down, and all my airplanes and everything that I've so hard for.  So I take my .38 out of the safe, and I'd sit in my office in front of the door with my .38.  I was just waiting for somebody to come in my hangar and I'm gonna shoot them, you know.  But I--this wasn't--nobody came in my hangar, nobody bothered me.  And the riots subsided.  But after this happened, I began to soul search just a little bit.  And I said to me, "What would you have done if somebody had come in that hangar?"  If I had of shot somebody and killed them, I never would have--I would never had been able to deal with it, you know.  That would have haunted me the rest of my life.  So I found the person who owned that gun and I gave it back to him.  And that was the end of any gun ownership that I might have.  I've never had a need, except when in the war [World War II, WWII] when I had, you know, 450 sticking out of the wings.
Story_ID: 313719
Speaker 1: When you look back over your life, what stands out most of all the things you've been able to do as the highlight (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Of all the things that I--yeah.  That, you know, I've done--I've had a lot of highlights.  But I think the day I graduated [from the Civilian Pilot Training Program at Tuskegee Army Airfield; Sharpe Field, Tuskegee, Alabama] and my mother [Nona Bertrand Burns] pinned my wings on me, I get emotional just talking about that, you know.  The day my mother pinned my wings on me, she was so proud.  (Unclear).  I think that was the moment in my life that I will--if I had to lose all of this, that's the one that I would like to retain.
Story_ID: 313720
Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be of what you--when this is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I would like for my legacy to have been that I spent much of my life with you, young people.  Whether it be flying or just to--history or just to, you know, or trying to get them to go the right way.  That's really what I would like for my legacy to have been.  I've done a lot of talking to kids.  I don't know that any of them ever went the straight and narrow because of my conversations with them.  I like to think that I, you know, if I--just one, I would like to think--but if I had it to do all over again, I think I'd spend my life bringing children into aviation.  I think I'd be a teacher, which I don't like.  I don't like teaching curriculum, you know, the fundamentals.  I wouldn't want to be involved with that.  But if I were teaching them something that I knew and I loved, you know, like aviation, any facet of aviation; if I were doing that, I could be very comfortable with it.  If I could just think that I could have formed aviation in some significant number of children's minds.
Story_ID: 313721
Speaker 1: What do you think is the state of the black community today?  What state are we in?
Speaker 2: What state are we in?  Denial, you know.  It's--we're in several states. There are some states where there's community involvement, and that usually is the poor communities.  Okay.  We have the affluent state where we forget our roots, not entirely, but to some extent.  I think we have--we've reached a point where were assimilating into society in a great manner.  And then, I'm not too sure that we didn't stop there.  I'm not too sure that we continued.  I think we reached a point where a significant number of us became comfortable--me included--became comfortable and we ceached--we ceased to search where we could do better.  May not necessarily be true, but that's kind of my feel for it.  I would like--on the one hand, I would like to see a total assimilation where there was no need for affirmative action and all this sort of good stuff.  I would like to see where it's just a matter of course.  Everybody live where they want to live; everybody went to school where they want to school; all the schools were equal, which they're not.  That takes me to one that would really like to get into.  I have a very bad taste in my mouth about the educational system throughout the nation, but primarily in my home, in L.A. [Los Angeles, California]. I have occasion to go into schools and talk to kids, and I go in the black schools and talk to black kids and Mexican kids; and I go in the white schools and I talk to white schools.  If you haven't done the two, you probably don't have a good feel for the discrepancies that exist.  There is no comparison to the quality of education, to the facility, to the goods and services, to the availability of books, to any aspect of quality education.  There is no comparison.  A lot of that is the fault of us not having the discipline that we should have that does exist in other schools.  And I'm not sure whether the chicken or the egg.  Is it the chicken or the egg?  Which came first, the violence or the poor education or the lack of discipline in schools?  Which came first?  If I were a ruler of anything, my first rule would be that school teachers have unlimited authority to do anything they want to do.  Anything.  Now, you got to naturally have a moral line drawn outside of moral degradation.  But the teacher would be the absolute ruler in the school.  If the student misbehaved, the teacher would take care of it.  If the student wasn't learning, the teacher would take care of it.  And the parent would support the teacher.  That's what we had when I went to school.  And it worked very well, 'cause we had a good education.  Kids aren't getting educated.  Kids are finishing college today and can't read or write.  It's a shame at what I see in the educational system.  And the majority is not particularly concerned about it.  And the minority doesn't know what to do.
Story_ID: 313722
Speaker 1: What do you think about popular culture?  And I want--what do you think I mean I'm talking about?  Music.  Hip-hop.  What do you think about the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You have to--I don't think it's constructive.  Okay.  I don't it serves any purpose.  And there not many people in this country who would agree with me. But I think we have degenerated in culture.  But cultures have cycles.  And I'm hopeful that this cycle will end soon, but I'm not sure what the next cycle is going to bring.  Now, if we can--if maybe we would learn our lessons and say, "Okay.  Once we get rid of this one, we're gonna do something to see that this kind of a thing doesn't happen again."  I understand the culture.  I don't understand the vulgarity.  I don't understand the lack of morals.  Those things I don't understand.  I understand the anger.  Okay.  I understand the anger.  And I take--for a younger generation, I kind of feel empathy for them for that reason.  But I don't see the vulgarity, the profanity, the morals as being--as serving any purpose in that particular way.  There is nothing pretty much taking place today in our culture, in our young people's culture, and yet I see them enjoying it.  I see my kids, you know, who are not young.  I see my kids enjoy it.  Khep [HistoryMaker Khephra Burns] and Susan [Susan L. Taylor].  You know.  I see them subscribing to it.  But I don't, you know, I look at me as an old fogey, maybe.  But I don't see that it serves any purpose.
Story_ID: 313723
Speaker 1: I have two questions left for you.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: The first one is Khephra's [HistoryMaker Khephra Burns] piece last night.  First, it was a great piece and we should go on record saying that.  But why do you think theatre or like a piece like that reaches, like you look--I was the only black guy in my section.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It doesn't reach a broad (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, number one--
Speaker 1: It doesn't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  BAM [Brooklyn Academy of Music, New York, New York] did a tremendous of bringing in an audience.  These, the people that came in there, are of a cultural environment.  Okay.  They do this because it's something and it's an experience to them.  They appreciate it because of the art.  Okay.  Now, last night there were an awful lot of black people in there, because of the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: --the Boule [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity] people were there.
Speaker 1: Right.  That's correct.
Speaker 2: And the night before I would say were predominantly white.  But those were people who belong to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Of theater people.
Speaker 2: --that theater, you know.  I'm not saying that's the only reason they were there.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.
Speaker 2: Because they were there every night, you know.  But I think if it were not for that, if it were well-advertised and well-sponsored, that they would be there, because they have more--they have an open mind.  There's a group of people in our society that have an open mind.  And they didn't look at this as being an ethnic venture.  They look at it more as being an artistic endeavor.  Unless you look at it as being an artistic endeavor, it may not mean as much to you, because I did not understand a word of what was said.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I have a problem (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --in assimilating speech.  I can look at you and then listen to you and I hear you.  But if you turn your head around, okay, I might not understand what you're saying.  And it's a neurological thing, not of audio hearing.  So I have a very difficult time with the accents, and the fact that I don't--you know, I have trouble assimilating the voice, understanding.  So I had to look at this without any idea of what was going on for the most part.  Now, I can read the subtitles in French.  But most of what was said on the stage, I had difficulty with.  I had to go back three times.  Now each time I go back (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But it was so visual that you follow.
Speaker 2: --I get more and more.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  You can follow the story.
Speaker 2: But, yeah.  The art (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you know, as I begin to appreciate the art of the puppets, then it became more entertaining for me.
Speaker 1: And just for the record, we should tell people we're talking about 'Tall Horse,' which was at BAM last night (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --opened October 4th [2005] for its New York [New York] premier.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Tremendous (simultaneous)--

Speaker 1: My last question is:  so what would you like--with the remainder of your life, what's left for you to do?  What would you like to do with the time you have left to spend on this earth?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's a good question, 'cause I think my answer will be probably not be what I would want it to be.  What I would like to do for the rest of my life, is probably to be healthy; to be able to live it comfortably for my age this point on, because I'm--I've already assumed I'm on borrowed time, you know.  From here on in it's gravy.  I've had a very full life, so I have no regrets.  I wish that I had the energy, I wish I had the physical being, I wish that I had the mental capacity to continue doing what I love to do.  But I don't, and I have to accept the fact that I don't, and I have to settle for what is left.  I wish I could maybe talk somebody else into doing what it is that I can't do.  Maybe that--if I could do that, then I would be happy.
Speaker 1: Well, what are you going to do?  You're gonna golf?  You gonna fish?  You gonna (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm gonna golf.  Yeah, golf and travel.  Those are the two things that I can probably do.
Speaker 1: Go ahead.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: And the two things that I can probably do, you know, and just be as healthy as I can, as happy as I can and enjoy life as much as I can.  Help anybody that I can, as much as I can.  I'd like do that.  And also, if I can talk some younger person who does have the energy and the mental acuity and the--and all the good things, to do what it is that I failed to do, then I would like to do that.
