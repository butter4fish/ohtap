Story_ID: 542726
Speaker 1: I want to start out by asking about your father. I know you don't know much about your father, but if you could tell his name and you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I, I, I mean, I, I do know some background.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I, I, I knew my father. He, he divorced my mother [Phyllis Wells] when--he and my mother divorced when I was young. But my father's name was Theodore V. Wells, Sr. He was born in Washington, D.C., in 1922. He only had a sixth grade education. He grew up in a very poor family. His father is--who I never met--was a gambler, and they called him Long Shot Red [ph.]. And that's really--I, as I said, I never had the opportunity to meet my grandfather, though I've seen pictures of him. And as I said my father grew up very poor. It was just--very large family, fifteen kids, something to that effect. And my father joined the [U.S.] Navy during World War II [WWII]. And when he got out of the service, he got a job at the U.S. Navy department [U.S. Department of the Navy] in the copying room, what we would call the reproduction center or Xerox room. And he worked there and he also at night drove a taxi cab. So he was a cab driver and worked in reproduction at the U.S. Navy department. And he met my mother, who was a country girl from Virginia. And she came up to D.C. at the age of eighteen and got a job at the Navy department in the mailroom. She was a mail clerk for thirty-five years in, in, at the U.S. Navy department. And they met, got married. It was my father's second marriage. And they had--I was born in 1950 and then I had a sister [Toni Wells] who was born in 1961.
Speaker 1: Can I, can we go back? Your fath- Von, was that--
Speaker 2: V-O-N (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) that's really your father's name also, Von, the same--
Speaker 2: Theodore, correct.
Speaker 1: Theodore Vo- Von. Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did your mother ever tell you what was, what, what--how you resembled your father?
Speaker 2: I, I look very much like my father. We almost look like twins. And my son [Phillip Wells] looks like me, so I guess (laughter) follows in the genes.
Speaker 1: Now, tell me, how did your parents meet? That's what--do you--
Speaker 2: They met at the U.S. Navy department--
Speaker 1: They, okay.
Speaker 2: My, my father worked in the, I said, in the reproduction room, the copy room where they made copies of things, and my mother was a mail clerk. And, and they met and got married and, and as I said I was born in April of 1950.
Story_ID: 542727
Speaker 1: Tell me about your mother [Phyllis Wells] and her background. What do you know about her background (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, my mother's still alive. She's--my, my father [Theodore V. Wells, Sr.] died maybe nine or ten years ago, but my mother's eighty-four years old, and she is a great person. She grew up in Virginia. She was adopted. So she does not know much about her past at all. But she was adopted by her adopted [sic. adoptive] mother and father who were tenant farmers in Virginia and right outside of Leesburg [Virginia]. And it's farm country out there. And my grandmother--her name was Grace [ph.]--and she was kind of what you called a cook in the big house. My, my grandmother used to be the cook for Arthur Godfrey, who was a very renowned radio announcer back in the '50s [1950s]. And he had this huge horse farm, and my grandmother was the cook. And my mother, because her mother was a cook, learned to cook at a very early age 'cause she had, she used to have to cook for the rest of the family. And so my mother is a great cook. And my mother grew up on, basically on a farm. And when I was young I used to go up there quite a bit. But I will be very honest with you. I'm a city boy. I did not like the country, and the minute I arrived I was ready to go home. I did not--you know, I mean this was real country. I mean, they had an outhouse. I did not like having to go to the bathroom in the outhouse. I was candidly bored by being up there. People who had the ability, you know, to sit on the front porch in, in a rocking chair and just look at a road where it would be very rare to see (laughter), see another car. But that's how people lived in, in, in rural America. Now, now today where my mother grew up the town w- is called Purcellville [Virginia]. Purcellville is part Washington, D.C., now a suburb. But when we were coming up it was a, a small town with one traffic light and, and farms surrounding. And so, I mean, when I was a little boy we used to go up in November and slaughter pigs and--that was slaughter time. So I remember watching how they would slaughter the pigs and--with the chitterlings and the pig brain and trying to preserve the meats. It was, yeah, it was, you know it was typical situation with people as I said who, who lived and grew up on a farm.
Speaker 1: Did your mother share any stories that stick out to you about her growing up, you know, there? Did you remember any stories that she told you?
Speaker 2: I, I, I really don't. My mother--what, what, what I know is that part of Virginia was very segregated. My mother has a high school education, never, never had a chance to go college--very, very bright woman, just didn't, didn't have that opportunity. During that period, Virginia was one of the more segregated states, and she went to segregated schools. And she talks about when they would go to the movies how they had to sit, I think they had to sit in the balcony or it was a sec- separate section. And that was during the period where in Virginia, you know, blacks were not permitted to go to, you know, restaurants, you weren't permitted to go to same bathroom, you weren't permitted to drink from the same water fountain. I mean, Virginia is not that far from Washington, D.C., where I grew up, but, but Virginia is truly a state of the South. And that, that was where the Confederacy had its capital and of--and, and Virginia, historically, was one of the more segregated states.
Story_ID: 542728
Speaker 1: Now, what is your earliest memory of growing up? Like the--you know, you talk about your memory being in, spending the summers, but what is your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure. I guess one of my earliest memories is when we moved to the house that I grew up in and--I was born in Washington, D.C. At that time, time of my birth, we lived in apartment somewhere over on 18th [Street] and U Street. And when I was five or maybe even four we, we, we--my parents [Phyllis Wells and Theodore V. Wells, Sr.] purchased a house. And I am a child of the Brown vs. Board of Education decision [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954]. Brown was--decision was--came down May 17th, 1954. And D.C., D.C. school system, was one of the five school systems that were a part of the Brown decision. D.C. had a segregated school system and D.C. was desegregated as a, as a result of the Brown case. The Brown case--the, the D.C. case was called Bolling v. Sharpe [Bolling v. Sharpe, 1954]. We all, we refer to it as Brown v. Board of Education and that was case out of Topeka, Kansas, and that was the case that was filed first. But there were five consolidated cases--Delaware, Kansas, D.C., Virginia, and, I think, South Carolina. And so D.C. school system was desegregated right as I was starting kindergarten. And what happened after Brown, you, you had a number of white neighborhoods suddenly open up that had been closed to African Americans. And my parents, to use the phrase, moved to Northwest, Washington and--I guess it was uptown, I guess that's what you'd call it, from downtown where they lived. And we were the first black family to move on that block. And this is still in the center of D.C. And I--what I remember is when we first moved in, the white (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you were four?
Speaker 2: I was four or five. But I just--it--but the memory that sticks with me is the white neighbors used to put a for sale sign in our yard every night. And finally my father came, came home one night with a, with a truckload (laughter) of guys from the Xerox room, from the reproduction room [at the U.S. Department of the Navy], and they walked up and down the street cursing. And after that all of the signs stopped and people basically moved out. I mean, I would say by the time I was eight, my neighborhood was all black. And I ended up--most of the schools--that first year, I guess, when I started kindergarten, you saw integration. But by the time I was in fifth grade, sixth grade, most the white kids had moved to the suburbs. And so when I--and I always went to public schools, so when I went to junior high [Paul Junior High School; Paul Public Charter School, Washington, D.C.] and high school [Calvin Coolidge High School; Calvin Coolidge Senior High School, Washington, D.C.] we had, you might've had two or three whites in a class out of hundreds 'cause white flight was that rapid. You can trace it right from the Brown decision and the D.C. schools opening up and whites fleeing to the suburbs of Maryland and Virginia.
Story_ID: 542729
Speaker 1: Now what was the address of the house that you lived--what was the address?
Speaker 2: Oh, it's 312 Madison Street. My mother's [Phyllis Wells] still there. She's been there since '54 [1954] or '55 [1955]. And I've remodeled it. It's--but it's a great, it was a great neighborhood. It was a, you know, you have that phrase it, what, it takes a village, well, we--it was old school. We had a village, and you can still hear my southern accent. Everybody from my block was from Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina. Basically, if you look at the migration of blacks during World War II [WWII], the East Coast and, and, and--people who lived in the South in terms of the East Coast, what I'll call Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, came, came to D.C. [Washington, D.C.]. People who lived further west in Mississippi and the Delta, they went to Chicago [Illinois]. So you, so you can actually look at the housing patterns, and you can figure out what groups of blacks from the South went to Washington and what groups went to Chicago and Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 1: Now I want to know--let's talk about that, the block that you were on at 325 Madison. Tell me--
Speaker 2: 312.
Speaker 1: Three- 312, sorry. Tell me who your, you know, who some of your neighbors were and, you know--
Speaker 2: It, it, it, it, it was an interesting neighborhood 'cause it was still during a period of segregation and the beginning of the Civil Rights Movement. And within the black community you had a mixture of what I'll call economic classes that you did not, you don't have today as neighborhoods have opened up. But my parents, they did not have a college education. They were basically government workers. And I said my father [Theodore V. Wells, Sr.] drove a cab to supplement his income. But we also had on our block--there was a, there was a lawyer, there were people--I don't think we had any doctors, but we had--there were two lawyers on that block. And D.C., I mean I lived in I guess what you would call a lower middle-class neighborhood in that my parents had regular jobs and, you know, and didn't make a lot of money--
Speaker 1: But a government jo- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They, they, they lived check to check. But you had the ability to get a row house. And as I said if you worked liked my father did, two jobs, you had a, you had a decent standard of living. And I could tell you, you know, like Georgia Avenue was like the dividing line. And the other side of Georgia Avenue you had kids that were from black families that were professionals, doctors, lawyers, you could jus- I mean in terms of the other side of the track, you knew exactly where the lines were. But you had a mixture of people going to school and, again, the black community was much more cohesive th- then as a result of segregation. And people did not have again the, you know, certain opportunities that exist today that cause, has caused the black community to disperse. So it was more of what I'll call a village atmosphere because a lot of people were from the South. There was a notion of extended family in the sense that my neighbors were like my extended mother. I mean, if I did something wrong, one of the neighbors would, would tell my mother that I did something wrong. And I knew that, and I knew my mother would be told. There was a, you know, a, a much greater sense of community. I mean, my mother, as I said, she worked as a mail clerk [at the U.S. Department of the Navy] for thirty-five years. She always--this is the Virginia farm girl in her--she got up every morning at 6:00, she took the bus to work. And before she took the bus she made me what I'll call a full country breakfast every morning. And I say a full breakfast, fried potatoes and onions, sausage, eggs. She'd put it on a plate after she cooked it and wrapped the plate in a brown paper bag and she'd walk me across the street to the house of a woman, Ellen El- Evans [Ellen Evans (ph.)]. And that's where I stayed. And Ms. Evans had six or seven kids. And that was like my--I stayed with Ms. Evans. And, and I, I arrived at her house by 7:00. And my mother then would go get the 7:00, you know, she tried to get the bus at 7:30, she'd be down there by 8:00. And so I had the best of both worlds 'cause my sister [Toni Wells] wasn't born 'til I was eleven. So I was almost like an only child at night with me and my mother. And--but I still had this extended family, Ms. Evans' family, where I stayed. And the neighborhood was just full of kids. I mean, I lived in the alley. D.C. has a lot of alleys. So I kind of grew up in the alley playing. But I had also, I was very lucky, I had a big field in front of my house. And we played in front of the field and--played on the field. And sports were very important. And it was good childhood.
Story_ID: 542730
Speaker 1: Let's (cough) go back to that, you know, to the block, and I want you to tell me what sights, smells, and sounds remind you of growing up.
Speaker 2: Well, back, back then people didn't have a lot of money for lessons like you--these kids today, my kids [Phillip Wells and Teresa Wells] included. You know, they're in these programs where they've, you know, a lesson for this, a lesson for that. People grew up just playing in the neighborhood and nobody had any money for lessons. I mean, I never went to camp. One year I went to a Boy Scout [Boy Scouts of America] camp, but that was only--except for that, I mean, during the summer, for example, I lived at Takoma swimming pool [Takoma Aquatic Center, Washington, D.C.]. That was the babysitter. We'd get up in the morning. My mother [Phyllis Wells] would be gone. And, you know, whether I was at Ms. Evans' [Ellen Evans (ph.)] house or by the time I was eleven maybe just, you know, la- more of what you call a latchkey kid, though I didn't know that term then, we'd get up and we'd go to swimming pool. And we would be, we were expected to be at the swimming pool when it opened at ten o'clock and we'd stay at the swimming pool all day long. And if we didn't go to the pool, we were expected to go across the street to the basketball court. And, and you'd stay at the recreation arena. And I had a field in front of my house that we played football on and baseball. And it was a very, it was, it was a neighborhood where sports were very important. We had a lot of great athletes come out, out of my neighborhood and, and we played cards. We played--I, by the time I was--I start playing bid whist when I was seven. We called bid whist ghetto bridge. And I grew up playing whist hours at a time late into the night. I used to tell people I was the whistologist (laughter). In fact, I stopped playing in college 'cause I couldn't get any competition. But by--I think, you know, more people at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] have probably had academic problems 'cause they got caught up in, in a culture of bid whist than anything else.
Story_ID: 542731
Speaker 1: I played cards and I read. I was a big reader. That kind of--there's one thing that--it was a little different for me. And I don't know where my love of reading came from. I cannot trace it to any moment in time. But I was a voracious reader from the time I was a young child. And I started off reading comic books. And my mother [Phyllis Wells] was a great smoker (laughter). She smoked from the time she was eighteen and stopped at seventy. And she's got, actually as I speak to you now, she's got lung cancer. But she'd never purchase by the carton. She would always, you know, like all smokers, well, I'm gonna stop soon, so I don't want to have a whole bunch of cigarettes. So she smoked two packs a day and I used to have to go to the drugstore twice a day. But as a reward for going to the store, she used to give me a dime to buy a comic book. So I'd go and I'd get the pack of cigarettes and I'd get a comic book. Sometimes she'd give me a quarter 'cause with a quarter you could get a comic book, a RC Cola, and a, and a, and a bag of potato chips, and so I was happy. And then I moved from comic books to regular books. And, I mean, I was in elementary school reading Sinclair Lewis and--I don't know where I got this love of reading from, but it just happened, and for many years I, I think that's what kind of gave me somewhat of a leg up in, in, in, in, in terms of school because I, I did read so much. I just loved to read.
Speaker 2: Now what where your favorite comics, comic characters or comic books?
Speaker 1: Well, Superman, Flash, and Archie (laughter). There were no black comics or black characters in the comics when I was coming up. I mean, the only black show, you know, you--forget comics, there were none, there are no black figures. But you know on TV all we had was 'Amos 'n' Andy,' though I have to admit that I found 'Amos 'n' Andy' very funny when I was a, when I was a young kid. Now I, I since look back at it more analytically, and it's, it, it reminds you in some aspects of a minstrel show. But that was the only game in town. And I guess the, you know, we looked at the black lawyer [Algonquin J. Calhoun] on the 'Amos 'n' Andy' show and, you know, now you think he's a clown, but back then he was the black lawyer. He was one of them few black lawyers you knew (laughter). But that, that was one of the few, few black shows we had and that was before the blaxploitation films. You didn't have black figures in the movies to speak of. So 'Amos 'n' Andy' was a big deal.
Speaker 2: And what are the books then did--when you migrated to books, what other books did you, you said Sinclair Lewis (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well I remember, I mean, 'Babbitt' [Sinclair Lewis], 'Arrowsmith' [Sinclair Lewis]--how I got into this Sinclair Lewis thing. Then I got into a Dickens [Charles Dickens] thing. But I mean I was reading serious books. I was not reading--I went from comic books some way to, to classics. And how that happened, I don't have a recollection. But it wouldn't be uncommon for, sometimes for my friends to come by and I said, "No, I'm in the middle of this book. I'm gonna finish this book."
Story_ID: 542732
Speaker 1: But I'm still, you know, my best friends are still the people I grew up with. And, you know, it was, it was a close knit neighborhood and my, you know, my best friend's a guy named Cliff Burrell [ph.] who works, works in the computer room for The Washington Post and, you know, he didn't, he didn't finish college, but he, I mean he's smart as hell. I mean, just--you know, you know that's one thing you grow up in that period in the black community that you learn real earl- early on not to equate somebody's college degrees with intelligence 'cause you saw a lot of people who were smart but just didn't get a chance or maybe the environment was not conducive to their going on to college. I mean, 'cause you got, you know, we had, we had a different perspective. None of us knew anything about any white schools. I mean, for me when you thought about college, you thought about Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] or D.C. Teachers [District of Columbia Teachers College; University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.], and which was both, we were on right on Georgia Avenue. And, in fact, when I left for college my mother [Phyllis Wells] began rent- rent- renting my room out to women from Howard 'cause Howard's always had limited dorm space 'cause--so you could get right down to Howard from the bus line to, off 5th Street. I don't know how we're--I kind of lost my train of thought (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Story_ID: 542733
Speaker 1: You were talking about why or you're not sure how you gravitated to reading. I want to go back and explore that a little bit because (cough) I want to explore what type of child you were. Were you--I mean you say you loved sports, so obviously you liked--and you talk a lot about being outside, you know, and playing with, you know, with other ki- neighborhood kids. But what--it also sounds like you had sort of a quiet side, too. And I'm just wondering--
Speaker 2: I was, I mean, I was a very responsible child. And I was responsible because I was raised by my mother and, though we always had plenty of food, you know, we lived check to check, and I knew we lived check to check. And I saw my father [Theodore V. Wells, Sr.] periodically, but he really didn't live with us. This was not an 'Ozzie and Harriet' ['The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet'] family. I lived--my mother was basically a single parent and who is just so loving and just so kind and this--. My mother was the neighborhood mother, even though she worked all the time, she--and still is at, at eighty-four, my mother still runs my high school alumni association [Calvin Coolidge Alumni Association, Inc.]. Everybody refers to my mother today as Ma Wells [Phyllis Wells]. She is the mother of Coolidge High School [Calvin Coolidge High School; Calvin Coolidge Senior High School, Washington, D.C.], and hundreds of black kids call, view my mother as their mother. And she's just that kind of person who believes in unconditional love. You'll sit down with her and you want to stay and you want to talk with her and you know that she's really thinking about you and has nothing but your best interest at heart. And for whatever reason I was very protective of my mother. I didn't, I didn't, I didn't cause any trouble 'cause I didn't want her, you know, she was, she was struggling to make it. And I think also--I had a couple of incidents when--my father's life that I think matured me at a young age. First, when I was in, I guess I was in third grade, he was shot. There was--this was all in the papers in D.C. [Washington, D.C.].
Story_ID: 542734
Speaker 1: When I was in third grade my father [Theodore V. Wells, Sr.] was shot. He was at his job at the Navy department [U.S. Department of the Navy] in the reproduction room and a guard came in and pulled his gun and as he was gonna--the, the guard's wife worked in the room. And the guard had found out that his wife had had an abortion, had aborted the guard's baby without telling him and, and what happened actually he first that morning got up and went and killed the doctor and the nurse who had performed the abortion. He then went to the Navy department and he walked in and there were three people in the room at that time, the woman, my father, and a guy named Gus Valentine [ph.]. And he said, "I'm going to shoot you and I'm going to kill everybody else, too." And my father broke for the door (laughter), guy said he gonna kill everybody. And the guy shot my father in the back, but my father--it went, the bullet went to the shoulder and he kept running. And he--the guy killed his wife. He shot Gus five times, Gus lived. And, and then he killed himself. I mean it was in all the papers. But I remember I was a, I was a patrol guard. And, I guess it was lunchtime. Maybe we were--I just have this recollection being on at 3rd Street, 3rd and Missouri Avenue, when they came and got me. So maybe it, maybe we were doing it at lunch. I'm trying to get the timing back. But I know, I know they told me I had to go home, and Ms. Evans [Ellen Evans (ph.)] told me my father had been shot. And (sigh) I remember that day, day. That, that impacted me a lot. Though, I, I'll be honest, I was glad that the guy had killed himself 'cause it would have scared me. And then after that my father--I don't know, I don't know--he developed some mental problems. And maybe the trauma of the shooting or what, I don't know to be very honest with you. But he was at various times hospitalized at St. Elizabeths. So I grew up not only with my father not being there, but my mother's [Phyllis Wells] a very responsible woman and no they weren't together, together, you know, we would visit him during those periods when he was at St. Elizabeths Hospital, which was the mental hospital in Washington, D.C. And a lot of my childhood I remember--I mean, as--you talk about things that impact you. I remember going from Northwest [Washington, D.C.] over to St., St. E, which was in the other part of town, and spending time on that floor both with my father and other people. I believe that's--I probably learned to talk to anybody and everybody there 'cause if you can go and sit and talk to people in a mental ward, it's very, it can be a very interesting experience, but also a very sobering experience. And if you're a kid of ten or eleven years old, it does make you grow up. So, you know, I think I was affected by all of that. And, look, my fa- hey, my father was a very brilliant man. If you talked to him, you could just see the, the raw intelligence. But you have to understand, he was trapped. He had no education. And when you don't have any education, you end up, you either, you know, you turn to other things. And some people turn to crime, some people, you know like turn to drugs, my father didn't do any drugs. Some people turn to women. My father, I think, was, you know, that was, you know, he was, you could probably say he was a womanizer (laughter). And he married multiple times. But if--you know, he was, he was smart, he was handsome, but he was trapped by lack of education and segregation. And so what, what was his thing in life? And I guess his thing in life was he was kind of a rolling stone. And--but he had his mixture also--like I said, various times had his mental issues, but he, he's a very smart man. I, I don't--I was not close to him, but I understand him.
Story_ID: 542735
Speaker 1: My father [Theodore V. Wells, Sr.] was ahead of his time. I'll tell you a story, you know, George Foreman has nine kids named after him, I think. And my father did the same thing far before, long before George Foreman. To my understanding there's--I think he has four Theodore V. Wells, Jr.'s. And I don't know them. My prob- my father, I probably have nineteen half brothers and sisters, of which I have no relationship with. But when my father died, you could see it in--I didn't even go to the funeral cause. But there's four of us as I understand it with the same name. I asked him one time before he died, "Why'd you do it?" He said, "Well, I figured one of y'all might make it." And (laughter), you know it's--and that is a--if you understand his background, it's, it is very understandable, okay. That is--that shows a degree of hope, I--maybe one of my kids might do something, might do some, you know. 'Cause I think if he had had the right education, had the right opportunities, he wanted to do something. But this wasn't his world, so he worked in the copying room [at the U.S. Department of the Navy] and he drove his cab and, I mean, that was our car. People--this was not--in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] it was not like in New York City [New York, New York] where you have a yellow medallion and take it back to the shop at night. In D.C., peopled owned their cabs. The cab was the family car, you know. So it wouldn't be unusual in Washington to see people in taxicabs riding around also as a family car. You went to the supermarket in the cab. But--and later on it was a big deal 'cause he, when he had--he got a second car, I remember. He had a, he had a, he had a Chrysler Imperial. It was like a Cadillac. That's what everybody wanted, a Cadillac (laughter). That was the big thing back then--could you get a Cadillac? He didn't get a Cadillac, but he had an Imperial. And, like I said, I don't feel any--he's a compl- you know, complex man by his times. He was not a loving father. We had a relationship. I don't think--I'm trying to think, I don't think he came to my high school graduation. I know he didn't come to anything for college or law school or business school or anything else. But in his own way, he's, you know, I know he loved me, in his own way, okay. But it's--but the type of poverty he came from, and I was only one generation removed from, I understand that and I understand what that can do to you and it can do to your, your value system. So I don't, I, I don't have any ill will or anything other than understanding that he was a, he was a good guy and then I know he tried to, you know, give a little money to my mother [Phyllis Wells] when he, when he had it. But, he probably had to spread that money around (laughter) to a number of places.
Speaker 2: Did you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But he worked--but my father worked, you know, my father worked hard--probably played too hard. But he worked hard.
Speaker 2: And you probably came to that understanding over time, right, I bet--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --over the years.
Speaker 1: Yeah.

Speaker 1: Back to your reading. Do you know why--you--I mean, this whole thing with you being--you said you were a responsible child. And I was just wondering in the books were there, were you discovering a world outside of your neighborhood? Was that (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, without--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --without question. Books took me to London [England] or took me to the world of medicine or even sports. Would--you know, you could travel with books. Books could permit you to go places, but also think about values. But, you know, I mean one of the things--if you, if you look back at the TV shows we were raised on, though they didn't have any black people, they were shows about values. I mean, I grew up on 'Father Knows Best,' 'Donna Reed' ['The Donna Reed Show']--people used to call my mother [Phyllis Wells] the black Donna Reed. And they were shows that, you know, every episode usually had a value. And, you know, 'Leave it to Beaver.' That's--those were the types of TV shows. We didn't grow up with shows with a lot of violence. I mean, we had a lot of, you know--to the extent there was shooting on shows. It was--you had a lot of cowboy shows on back then and cowboys and Indians [Native American] so. I never played--I don't remember playing cowboys and Indians (laughter) at all. But, you know, for whatever reason, whether it was books, TV, combination, my mother--'cause my mother was not a religious person. We didn't--church was not something that was part of my life. And in part, you know, it was funny 'cause we didn't have enough--my mother, my mother's view was you had to have some money to go to church 'cause you had to be dressed up. And my m- and we didn't, we, you know, my mother didn't have a lot of clothes, dressy clothes like that. And she didn't try to compete in that world. And that was just her view. I'm not trying to criticize anybody else. But, you know, everybody's part of their culture. In my, in my house, food was a big thing. My mother grew up on a farm. And we always had a lot of food. My--and bakery--I don't eat baked--I don't eat cakes and pies today 'cause my mother was like the neighborhood baker. My mother, part of her culture, she worked five days a week and on Saturday and Sunday she baked. And she baked out of enjoyment. And all the kids would be there at my house all the time eating the cakes and the pies. And so I, you know--it was like it was so much there, I st- you know, I didn't really eat that much (laughter) of it. But she always baked for the whole community.

Speaker 1: Now school, tell me where you went to elementary school.
Speaker 2: Well, I went to--I started at Rudolph [Rudolph Elementary School, Washington, D.C.] and then they changed--they kept changing the boundaries. What happened right after Brown [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] you had a lot of--I don't know if gerrymandering is the right term, but they kept changing the school districts those first few years. So I went to Rudolph--not like we moved or the schools moved--they just kept shifting us. So we went--I started at Rudolph for kindergarten, first, second grade--
Speaker 1: Now in kind- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and then I, and then I went to Keene [Keene Elementary School, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Now, let me ask you, in those, 'cause you--were your teachers white at that time when you first went?
Speaker 2: It was--
Speaker 1: You know, because remember how--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --you said that that--
Speaker 2: I think--that's right. You saw, what you saw in those first few years at Rudolph, but it was changing rapidly. And I mean the schools were opening up. The lines were changing. People were moving out. I remember there's a guy, [HistoryMaker] Sterling Tucker, I think. I was reading a book, really th- thumbing through a book recently about kind of thing. He, he was the first black person to run for the, he wanted to run for the D.C. board of education [District of Columbia State Board of Education]--wanted to just to be on the board. So ar- all this was opening up. I mean I'm living in real time as D.C. [Washington, D.C.] in terms of its public school is trying to desegregate. So almost from the time I entered the system, this is ongoing battle. Remember, back then we didn't even have a vote. D.C. we did not even get the right to vote until I was probably eighteen years old when--the first appointed mayor was a guy named Walter Washington. And they--before that we had a commissioner or something. We, we had no right. And people, I tell people this, that we couldn't vote for city council--we had no such animal. We had no vote at all. And I think by the time I was eighteen maybe they let us vote for the mayor. And it was years before we could vote for the president. Well that's--so that's, you know, growing in Washington, it was--growing up in D.C. for me was growing up in a very segregated city, going basically to all-black schools all my life. But I'll tell you we didn't know a lot about--I mean I talk about how segregated the city was, but we didn't have a lot of problems with white people 'cause we didn't really see too many white people. And to the extent we, we were around white kids, if--they were the few kids that hadn't moved out, so we were in the majority. So you could grow up in Washington, D.C. and not be exposed to that many white people. And I don't think I saw a poor white person 'til I went to college [College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Massachusetts], you know, 'cause D.C. didn't have a--you know, D.C. was a government town. And, you know, most the whites you saw was people in, in government at big jobs. I mean I'll give you an example, my son [Phillip Wells] went to Georgetown University [Washington, D.C.]. I didn't even--the first time I saw Georgetown University in my life was when I took my son in nine- in the 1990s to visit the campus. We didn't go to that--I never went to Georgetown [Washington, D.C.]. I didn't go to that part of town. It was--didn't think about it, just didn't think about it. Didn't even know Georgetown was back there. Same thing, American University [Washington, D.C.], George Washington [George Washington University, Washington, D.C.], I didn't--I know those schools were in town, but I never saw 'em. I could tell you where Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] was. I could tell you where D.C. Teachers [District of Columbia Teachers College; University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.] was, but I couldn't--I didn't know anything 'cause this--that's how segregated the city was.
Story_ID: 542738
Speaker 1: Now when you--this, this change in demographic, do you remember any racial incidents at the beginning or not?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember when we first moved in--
Speaker 1: That, that one you spoke of (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, and then what happened--I mean, the whole time I'm coming through school it--if you look at the, at the boycotts starting in--Montgomery boycott [Montgomery Bus Boycott] started in '54 [sic. 1955], all of my younger years in elementary school and junior high were marked by what was going on in the Deep South in terms of the desegregation efforts being led by Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]. Then what you saw by the time I got to high school, you saw this g- this, this tension between Dr. King's nonviolent movement and Malcolm X and then the student nonviolent committee at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], but they--that morphed really into the Black Power movement. And see--and Howard was a base for us. Howard was not that far. I mean, I lived--I went to Coolidge High School [Calvin Coolidge High School; Calvin Coolidge Senior High School, Washington, D.C.]. Howard was around Roosevelt [Theodore Roosevelt Senior High School, Washington, D.C.] and Cardozo [Francis L. Cardozo Senior High School; Francis L. Cardozo Education Campus, Washington, D.C.] in terms--these are high schools in my league. But, you know, we were very sensitive what was going on on the Howard campus. So you had the rise of Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture]. And Stokely started out really as, my recollection, he was probably the first chairman of SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]. And then he broke, and he, H. Rap Brown [Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin] started talking about black power. That's really where black power, the phrase black power, started, right on the Howard campus. So we grew up, my whole generation, we grew up the Civil Rights Movement and then Dr. King was assassinated April 4 of '68 [1968]--that's my senior year in high school. The city rioted that night. I mean I remember we came out, and you had troops in the neighborhood. The main riot was, was right, was started right down by Howard and kind of spread out on Georgia Avenue and 7th Street. And you had minor riots--I lived right off Kennedy [Street], so I lived Georgia Avenue and Kennedy. And they tore some of the stores up, and they had troops on Kennedy, but it wasn't anything where they burned down things the way they did on 14th Street. But, you know, I mean, my, my senior year is marked by, Dr. King is killed April '68 [1968], Bobby Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy] is assassinated maybe two days after [sic.], before our graduation or after, I forget it was right--it was June. You know, John F. Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy], I can't--what, he was assassinated I guess when I was thirteen and Malcolm was assassinated when I was fifteen. I mean, we've, you know, I mean, we grew up in--we're in the heart of the Vietnam War, which, which is starting in the late '60s [1960s]. I mean my best friend Moto [ph.], Cliff [Cliff Burrell (ph.)], I mean he stayed back just so he wouldn't have to go to war, so he wouldn't get, you know--'cause he wasn't able--he tried to get in National Guard and couldn't that year. 'Cause back then the only way to stay out of the service was you had to have a deferment--no, I'm sorry, you had to have, you had to be in school to get a deferment. And if you were, and if you were black and couldn't get into a college, as a lot of my friends--they didn't have college plans. People would stay in, in high school for an extra year or two just so you wouldn't have to go to the war. So, look, it was--I'm a, I'm a child of the '60s [1960s].
Story_ID: 542739
Speaker 1: So what was the, what was the discussion that you and your friends were having as you're aware of what's going on? I mean, what do you remember neighbors saying? What do you remember the discussion, you know, whether it was in the barbershop or, you know, whatever? What, what is--
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, I mean, what, what we remember was the constant debate between Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] philosophy and Malcolm X's philosophy. I mean for those, you know--and Malcolm was real, the, to, to young kids. You know, we just didn't discover Malcolm when they gave us the autobi- you know, 'Autobiography of Malcolm X' ['The Autobiography of Malcolm X,' Malcolm X and Alex Haley]. I mean, well, you know was a real figure in our, in, in, in our lives and especially for those of us in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] who were kind of hooked in of what was going on at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], 'cause Howard was a hotbed of, of, of, of, of radicalism because of Stokely [Stokely Carmichael; Kwame Ture]. I mean--and remember, I mean, the, with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee [SNCC] they were right really at the point in terms of, you know, the Freedom Rides and the buses going down south. So I'm in high school [Calvin Coolidge High School; Calvin Coolidge Senior High School, Washington, D.C.] when all of this is coming up. But this is my neighborhood, okay. This is--so you're, you're, you know, you were tuned in. I mean, my senior year in high school I spent--I was a driver but they, remember they had the Poor People's March [Poor People's Campaign] and they had Resurrection City. And they'd come--the--I had my first--I had to go to nonviolent training school at a church--I forget the name of the church--'cause those of us were gonna work at Resurrection City. And I remember, I can remember being at the church and they were laying us down and telling us what to do if the cops started hitting us with the sticks. And then I had this great job. I had, I had a car, this, this old car, and I was the driver for what was called City Hall [ph.]. And remember, if you recall, it rained that whole week so that that--thousands of black people from all over the country. And, actually, some of the kids stayed at, stayed at my house for a while 'cause they didn't have enough people--the, the--some people from--think the group was the Invaders. What, what happened when Dr. King was assassinated in Memphis [Tennessee], he's going there 'cause there has been a, a protest about jobs. And I think one of the groups were the, was this, the Invaders--I, I may be having the name wrong--who were involved in the protest that he was there for when he, when he was assassinated. And some of these kids--they were young, college kids, ended up staying at my house for a few days 'cause it flooded. It hap- it wa- the water was so bad, it was--but I mean it was a great time for me. I mean I was eighteen years old, ready to go off to college [College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Massachusetts], and shuttling people around who were, you know, you know, civil rights heroes. And that was a, that, that was a fascinating period for me for being, you know, being a kid just graduated from high school. 'Cause remember, I mean, the, the march had been planned by Dr. King. And it went forward even, even though he'd been, he'd been assassinated. I mean one of my big regrets in life is that I didn't go to the March on Washington. And I, I think I was thirteen--'63 [1963], does that sound right?
Speaker 1: Sixty-three [1963].
Speaker 2: And I remember. I have this vivid memory. My mother [Phyllis Wells] wouldn't let me go. I wanted to go, and she thought there was gonna be a riot or some type of bomb or shooting, and she wouldn't let me go. And she--and, and I remember sitting on this corner debating should I get on this bus and, and I didn't do it. And to this day I've always regretted, I just should have defied her. But I didn't up and--gonna wish I had gone. I've always regretted that. I remember standing on that corner--and I debated whether I should go. And I said, no, go down there and get hurt then my mother'd be all upset. So I didn't go. But that's what I mean--we grew up with all of these issues because, I mean, if you look at Dr. King and his strategy and, you know, SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference], while, while all this was going on in Deep South, what they were trying to do is make sure that the whole country was exposed to what was going on. So, you know, I remember watching Huntley and Brinkley ['The Huntley-Brinkley Report'] and, you know, and you'd see the kids in the Deep South. I'm not talking about now about Virginia or North Carolina. I'm talking about in, you know, Mississippi and Alabama and Bull Connor and the kids getting hosed. So this was, you know, these kid, these kids were y- were our age. And then, as I said, when the, you know, when the si- many of the, the sit-in movements started, these were being started by college kids who were only three or four years my elders when I was in high school, okay. I mean, people talk about [HistoryMaker] Marion Barry. Okay, Marion Barry as mayor, Marion Barry had a drug problem. Marion Barry that I knew started out as civil rights worker 'cause that's, that's how I came to know Marion Barry. Marion Barry was one of the, one of the, one of the key civil rights, student civil rights organizers in those early days. And, and I've never forgotten that. You know, no matter what people may say about him and, you know, his conduct as mayor or con- or his lifestyle, but I, I, I go back. Marion Barry was one of the people right on the point. And that's the world we lived up, well, you know we grew up in.
Story_ID: 542740
Speaker 1: So there was really a tremendous sense of excitement and change is what you're talking about (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, like you were--and, and your mother's [Phyllis Wells] agreeing with this, too, you know, the older people--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --they're, they're, the--what are they--
Speaker 2: They're watching it and they're living it 'cause these are the people that really knew segregation, you know, at a, at a different level from us. I mean, you talk about growing up in, in Virginia in the, in the, in the '30s [1930s], '40s [1940s]. I'm talking about, you know, stark, serious segregation. You know, where we would go--I mean I--look, I remember as a little kid, you know, colored only in the terms of water fountains and bathrooms and all of that stuff. That's a part of why I didn't like going to Virginia. I didn't--and not only was it boring, I didn't--I'd rather go back to, to D.C. [Washington, D.C.]. It was a different--there was still segregation, but it was a whole different feeling.
Speaker 1: Well you were surrounded by yourselves, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right, that's right. And it created a, you know, with- without question a certain degree of confidence. We did not grow up with a minority atti- attitude. Didn't, just didn't--we had a different attitude. You know, we believed we could do anything, we could be anything. This was all, you know--I don't think the term affirmative action had been coined. And, you know, later on, I mean, I'm a firm believer in affirmative action, but, you know, part of the tension in terms of some of these terms, what they can do to you psychologically, 'cause they can create the attitude that you're a victim and that your circumstances are such that you just will not be able to exceed, succeed. And we did not, we weren't saddled with a lot of that. You know, we just, we, we didn't have an attitude of being victims and, again, we, you know, we just, look, I think all, all of this stuff is very complex and you know.
Story_ID: 542741
Speaker 1: Now, let me also ask was, was your friend Clifford [Cliff Burrell (ph.)], was he active also with all this act- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: He wasn't.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So was he more of a sports guy? Or what, what--
Speaker 2: He didn't like school. He just didn't like school. That was--
Speaker 1: Oh, so he was, he was han--
Speaker 2: He, he--
Speaker 1: Okay, he was hanging out. He wasn't--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --he just didn't like school. I was a sports person. I was--I mean, sports were everything. But Cliff--I'll be--look, Cliff's father was like my father [Theodore V. Wells, Sr.]. His father--not, not like my--but he--
Speaker 1: He was--
Speaker 2: His father was not like my father. Cliff's father--Cliff truly had a, what I'll call a kind of a storybook family. He had it--he had sister, a brother, and him and, and his, but his--and his father liked my father 'cause his father worked in the reproduction room at the Department of Army [U.S. Department of the Army]. So both our fathers had similar jobs. But his father was kind of family man and my father was not a family man. And Cliff's father was like my mother [Phyllis Wells], from Virginia. His name was Edgar [Edgar Burrell (ph.)]. And he's just a great man. I mean, he used to take us--he loved children. So--and people can sense other people that love children. I mean children can sense it. And, and he used to take us, Cliff and I, for example, we would go down to 14th Street on Friday and Saturday night when we were, you know, twelve years old. And Cliff's father loved the street life. He wasn't part of it, but he loved being part of it. And it wouldn't be any- you know, it would be common for us on a Friday or Saturday night to go down--we might have a conversation with a prostitute standing on the corner or might talk to a friend of mine was a drug dealer. And his father thought it was important that we be able to talk to everybody and we know everything that was going on. And it was, you know, I look back--it was very unique. But Mr. Burrell, he would take us around and--to, to parts of D.C. [Washington, D.C.] that he didn't want us to go to and get exposed by ourselves 'cause we might get in some trouble or maybe we shouldn't be there but didn't want us to be away from it so that we might be scared of it or might think these people are different or, you know. You know, drove--I mean, I remember--yeah, you know, it was common--us go down to 14th Street and we would talk to anybody and everybody with, with Mr. Burrell.
Story_ID: 542742
Speaker 1: Now tell me how--when did you get active with sports. You said--was it in junior high or was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, I got active in sports in junior high. But even before that because I lived in front of a field. So even when I was small, there'd be older kids playing on that field. And I would have the au- audacity to go out and try to play with the older kids and they would, like older kids do, beat up the little kids and, you know, tease 'em. And if you did play, they'd, you know, throw the ball hard at you. And I had--you know, I was interested--I, I'll tell you, there's a guy lived three blocks from me named Kent Amos [HistoryMaker Kent B. Amos]--I don't know, you ought to do Kent.
Speaker 1: Oh, we did him.
Speaker 2: Have you done Kent?
Speaker 1: Yes, Kent Amos.
Speaker 2: Well, Kent and Barry Rand [A. Barry Rand]--you know, Kent and Barry were best friends.
Speaker 1: They were in your neighborhood--both of them?
Speaker 2: Kent lived three doors from me. And Kent's father [Benjamin Amos, Sr.] was the lawyer. And he lived--I lived at 312 [Madison Street] and Kent--maybe Kent lived at 304. And Kent was like my big brother. Kent's six years older than me. And Barry and Kent were best friends in high school. And Barry, you know, now he went on--almost was head of Xerox [Xerox Corporation] and, you know, is now the chairman of the board at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]. But I raise this 'cause you talk about sports 'cause Kent and Barry were both great athletes. And they used to treat me like I was the mascot. And I remember when Barry, who had gone to Paul, Barry had, Barry won the award as best ath- this Paul Junior High [Paul Junior High School; Paul Public Charter School, Washington, D.C.] was seventh, eighth, and ninth grade--it was junior high. And Barry (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That was your junior high, too.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Barry, and Barry went on to--he played at John Carroll [Archbishop Carroll High School, Washington, D.C.] or St. John's [St. John's College High School, Washington, D.C.]--I think it was Carroll. And Kent went to Coolidge [Calvin Coolidge High School; Calvin Coolidge Senior High School, Washington, D.C.] where I went, but six years ahead, of course. And Barry won the award for being the best athlete. And I remember I wanted that award--'cause Barry had gotten the award, and he had--you got your name up on a plaque and everything--and I want it. I remember I was so happy when I--'cause I--'cause Barry Rand had that award, well, I got it, too (laughter). But they used to beat me up all the time.
Speaker 1: And how much older were they than you?
Speaker 2: Six years.
Speaker 1: Six years. Six years older?
Speaker 2: Six, six years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Six years. See, my--no, I was, I was the baby, baby brother, the mascot. We did not--they beat me up. They were--'cause back then when you're young, six years is a big gap. Okay, so, if I'm ten and they're sixteen and they're out playing on that field and I want to play as a ten year old, they might let you play if they need an extra person. But usually they would just beat up the little kids. But they were nice, I mean, they were, you know, men, you know, and I've remained close to both of them.
Story_ID: 542743
Speaker 1: I mean it's interesting that all of you came from the same neighborhood, too. Were there any others that--names that we would know who came, who were--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --part of the com, community (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) see, see, Barry [A. Barry Rand]--and Barry grew up right across street from Rudolph [Rudolph Elementary School, Washington, D.C.], where I went to elementary school. Barry, Barry lived on--was that Farragut [Street]? But Kent [HistoryMaker Kent B. Amos] was, Kent was--well, you've got--my high school was--you had Judge Henry Kennedy [Henry H. Kennedy, Jr.]--was, he's a judge in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], also went to Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts]. And Henry was the first black person I knew to play tennis. I mean, we knew about Arthur Ashe--that I really knew who played tennis. And he was ahead of his time. And we used to tease him, 'cause tennis was not, you know--
Speaker 1: Was not a man's sport.
Speaker 2: Well, it just wasn't even in--no, we didn't know. Tennis is, you know, you needed lessons and, you know, it just wasn't something that, that black folk did. And--but Henry went on and played it at Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey] and went to Harvard, and now he's a federal district court judge. And there's a guy named Percy Luney, who also went to Harvard and was, was the dean at North Carolina Central [North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina], went to the law school and then last time I heard Percy had gone on to Florida A and M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida]--was starting a new law school. But I don't know if he's, if he's still down there 'cause I was talking to [HistoryMaker] Julius Chambers who thinks he left. But we had a great--I mean, Kermit Washington--I don't know if you remember Kermit was my high school center. He was two years behind me and, remember, he was the guy that hit Rudy Tomjanovich in the face and shattered his, his, his jaw when he was playing with the Lakers [Los Angeles Lakers]. Kermit was the enforcer for Jabbar [Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]. But Kermit couldn't even make my high school team, couldn't even--I mean, Kermit's a great, you know, it's a great story there 'cause Kermit could not even make--I mean he was on the team but didn't start. He was on the team and then that summer he worked out and the people at AU [American University, Washington, D.C.] saw him, and then he just grew and became this 6'8" monster and, you know, ended up playing in the NBA [National Basketball Association] for ten years before he really was drummed out after he hit Tomjan- Tomjanovich and did damage to his face turned Kermit--they kind--he got p- you know, he was ousted from the league and says--and very, very smart guy. But it was--you know, I, I was real proud because there's a guy here, Patrick Campbell [Patrick S. Campbell], young guy who just became a partner two years ago, black guy, who's from Coolidge [Calvin Coolidge High School; Calvin Coolidge Senior High School, Washington, D.C.], went to Coolidge ten years, well it's really twenty years, behind me. And I was real pr- and I was very proud that in this law firm--and we've only got three black partners--but two of us are from Coolidge. And it's--look, I, I still think the world of this school. It's--look, it's, it's, it--you know, the kids need help, you know. I mean, it's, it, it's--neighborhood's same, school's a little rougher 'cause drugs--I got out right before the drugs hit. Got out right before the drugs hit. 'Cause if you came back--I got out of high school in '68 [1968]--if you came back three years later, they actually had guards, you know, 'cause the drug problem had increased. And when I grew up we had gangs, people--you know, somebody might have a zip gun and people would fight maybe with--but, you didn't have these guns and these drugs. It changed--the, the, the influence of drugs and guns, and guns kind of became popular. So the gangs became rougher. When I came up we had the Decatur Street gang and the Ridge Park gang [ph.] and, you know, and there would be fights and, but now you can, you know, now instead of people getting in fights, you know, somebody will shoot you (laughter). So, it's, it's different; it's rougher. But, you know, it's my neighborhood, still is (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Don't you find that amazing, though, all of you came out of that neighborhood? That sort of--I mean it's a little--
Speaker 2: Well, we, you know--
Speaker 1: We're not talking about--
Speaker 2: --sixty-eight [1968]. No, no, they--those people came--that's right. I mean it was that--I don't know what it was. Kent and I talk about it sometimes 'cause right in that little period--and maybe it was just a little window. I don't, I don't know. We don't like to think it's a little window--we like to think it's a huge window. But it was--a lot of people came out--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --during that period. I mean I was, you know, I mean I look back at, at my class at, at Harvard Law School. And, you know, I mean--I had Ken Chenault [Kenneth Chenault], Frank Raines [Franklin D. Raines], [HistoryMaker] Kurt Schmoke. I mean, the--you know, I mean, how did we all get together? And I even look at Holy Cross [College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Massachusetts]. I tell people sometimes I think I'm Forrest Gump. I mean, you know, I mean I went to college with, you know, Clarence Thomas (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Clarence Thomas.
Speaker 2: You know, Sam Alito [Samuel Alito] and I were co-clerks--you know, just weird, just, you know, you kept falling into people, yeah. I do, I think I'm Forrest Gump. I believe (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Well, no, no it just seems like the cream is following you.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean it, you know--
Speaker 2: I keep meeting a lot of people. They--our, our paths cross.
Story_ID: 542744
Speaker 1: Now, you, did you always prefer football or was that the game (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Football.
Speaker 1: Football was the game back then--not, not--
Speaker 2: Well, well--
Speaker 1: --basketball, not--
Speaker 2: Well, I love basketball. I just wasn't a good enough player. We had some great basketball teams. And D.C. [Washington, D.C.] was, D.C. was a basketball hotbed. And lord knows if I was good enough, I would have preferred being a basketball star to being a football star. But I was not good enough at basketball. I turned out I was good at football. And, I mean, I played basketball, but I wasn't good enough to play at that level. And, I mean, we had, you know, really, you know, great teams. D.C.--and I mean I was coming through D.C. during the period, Sid Catlett, A- you know, Adrian [ph.], James Brown. James was like two years behind me at DeMatha [DeMatha Catholic High School, Hyattsville, Maryland]. I'm talking about James Brown the TV commentator. James was a great basketball player, great, great. I mean, he went to, you know--but, Teddy Kennedy [Edward M. Kennedy] came to D.C., we all remember, and recruited James to go to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]. And he probably should have gone to UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], but--he would have been pro, but he's had a great life so who can, you know, who can say? But I mean D.C. was really a basketball mecca. And if I could have, if I had the height--but I mean we're talking about people going, you know, going to the pros. So I was a g- I was real good football player. And--but I knew that sports held a way out, 'cause my, you know, 'cause I, like I said, my mother [Phyllis Wells] was a mail clerk. I didn't--I wanted to go to college, but I knew I'd have a much better chance going to college if I got a football, if I had an athletic scholarship, some type of scholarship. 'Cause I need--the white schools really didn't open up 'til after Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated. If you look, most of the, most of the integration occurs that September and really the big class is usually the class of '73 [1973]--that's because they had a whole year to recruit. And in most colleges you'll see when the largest classes they have of blacks is the class that graduated in '73 [1973], so those kids came in in the fall of '69 [1969]. And after that, if you look statistically, it plummets. And it has never gotten to those heights. But, I mean, we had a great football team. My coach, who was--we called him Daddy Gainous, and he really was one of the most important figures in my life. And Philip Gainous [Phil Gainous] is his name. He went to Spingarn High School [Joel Elias Spingarn High School, Washington, D.C.], played football at Morgan State [Morgan College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] with Le- the great Leroy Kelly, played for Earl Banks--was, Banks was the coach at Morgan, who put Morgan on the map. Think he's sort of like Eddie Robinson at Grambling [Grambling College; Grambling State University, Grambling, Louisiana]. And Gainous came to Coolidge [Calvin Coolidge High School; Calvin Coolidge Senior High School, Washington, D.C.] and was--guess even he might have been the first black football coach there. And we loved him. We swore by him. And he became our father figure. And he, you know, kind of took us into adulthood. And, and then he went on--and it was a big article in The Washington Post--somebody just sent it to me. I don't know where it is. 'Cause he became the, the principal at--it's Montgomery Blair [Montgomery Blair High School, Silver Spring, Maryland], I think--could have the school wrong. Think it's Montgomery Blair. And he's been the principal like thirty years. He's legend- legendary. He is one of those special people. He could have stayed on as football coach and been great. But he decided that he was gonna become a principal. And he's been a great principal. He's turned that school around. And they've done hu- they've done big articles on him in The Post--I mean just a special man. He was, you know, he, he was my, he was like my father, father I never had.
Speaker 1: What did you learn from him?
Speaker 2: I learned about hard work. I learned about perseverance. I learned about teamwork. I learned about leadership. I learned about setting examples for others to follow--just good values. And I learned this--this is a guy who loved us. So like, like I said, like how people would gravitate to my mother 'cause you could sense that love. These, these young black boys were gravitating to Gainous. He was like, I mean, he--like we, we knew he was what we needed. And he took us under his wing and kept us out of trouble in a time when people who were in sports were getting in trouble.
Story_ID: 542745
Speaker 1: I didn't even think I was going to a white school. I thought I was--when I--by the time I was in eleventh grade I had scholarship offers. I knew I was--I could go to Morgan [Morgan College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] or I could go play at Central, North Carolina Central [North Carolina College at Durham; North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina], I forget, scholarship offer to Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia]. Knew if, knew I could go down to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] and play if I wanted to, but I--their teams weren't that good as far as I was concerned. But that was kind of last, the, the very last stage before the white schools opened up. So when we came up, it was CIAA [Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association]. It was still a sense of the black athletes went to the black colleges [HBCUs]. So, I re- so, okay, so when I'm coming up--I mean, I'm in high school [Calvin Coolidge High School; Calvin Coolidge Senior High School, Washington, D.C.], we go down to How- Howard, we see the games. I mean, I, I remember seeing Earl Monroe when he was playing at Norfolk State [sic. Winston-Salem State University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina]. They called him Black Jesus, okay. And--these were--it was a different world that we grew up in that opened up and quickly changed as the white colleges opened up. But, as we're coming through from junior high and, and high school, we're thinking about going to black colleges and there's no thought of going to a Holy Cross [College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Massachusetts]. I didn't know what a Holy Cross, you know, what Holy Cross was. I didn't know, you know. And somebody said that's where Bob Cousy played--then it meant something to me--Bill Russell and the Celtics [Boston Celtics] and all that. But you know you didn't need--you had a different horizon. So I, I assumed really going in my senior year I was probably going to Morgan. I was gonna play for Coach Banks [Earl Banks]. I was gonna play for Coach Banks. And, and I was gonna go to Morgan State. That's what I've, I figured, you know. I'd tease Earl Graves [HistoryMaker Earl G. Graves, Sr.] who went to Morgan. I'd tease about it sometimes. But it was--that, that was the mindset.
Speaker 2: So what happened then? How did, how did--
Speaker 1: Well, I--senior year--this is before (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And what position did you play?
Speaker 1: I was a center.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I was, I was big. I was--I got out of high school, I was 6'2", 230 [pounds]. So I'm bigger, I was bigger then than I am now. And--but I was a rock and solid and all I did was lift weights. I had a eighteen and a half inch neck. I mean I looked like a monster. Maybe it was nineteen inches, you know, just--. And so my senior--suddenly these, a lot of white colleges started calling. And I originally, I signed to play at the University of Pittsburgh [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] and that's where--I thought I was going to Pitt and was gonna play against Notre Dame [University of Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana]. And, you know, Pitt had one of the--then and now, it wasn't in a league; it was independent then. It had one of the best football programs in the country. And I thought I'd play at Pitt. And so I signed with Pitt. I'd been announced in the Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] newspapers, you know, star athlete signs with Pitt. And then I went to a school assembly, and I met this guy from Haverford [Haverford College, Haverford, Pennsylvania]. There's a black guy trying to recruit kids to go to Haverford. And how, how he went to Haverford years ago, I don't remember. But--and the guy took a liking to me and said, "You really should come to Haverford. We could you a financial aid package and this would be, this is like a little Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]." And I got real confused. 'Cause I didn't--though I was a good athlete, I didn't think I had the, I, I didn't think I had a potential to play pro. And we had some people on my team who were good enough to be pro. So I knew, I knew the competition level. I knew I could play Division I, Division I, but I didn't think I was, I could go to the NFL [National Football League]. And that's cause I was, I lived in such a hotbed of athletic sports, we c- we knew kind of who the pro players, who had potential to go pro. I mean, when I was com- my senior year in high school, the, you know, the--there's a guy, Bruce Mitchell, and also a guy, Aubrey Nash, both who played at DeMatha [DeMatha Catholic High School, Hyattsville, Maryland], both who went to Kansas [University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas]. They didn't make pro, but we knew they had potential to be pros, okay. And Bruce back then, Bruce was like 6'6", 265 [pounds]. And it--am I--did I so something? Bruce was 6'6", 265, and I knew he had the ability. I couldn't get up to 265, and I got up 265, I, you know, I couldn't carry it. Bruce probably could have gone to 300 and, you know, I mean I played against him in high school and held my own, but he had the potential to go to the next level. I, I, I knew I didn't. So I was always realistic enough to know that college was gonna be it for me in terms of sports and that that would pay my way. But I had to think about other things.
Story_ID: 542746
Speaker 1: So I signed with Pitt [University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]. They offered me--then Haverford [Haverford College, Haverford Pennsylvania] tried to recruit me and I got confused. And I ended up as a compromise--I got confused and I--I had turned Holy Cross [College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Massachusetts] down. And then I, when I got confused I said maybe I should go take a, take the trip up there. So I hadn't gone--I went late in the year--it was April. I had already signed, and they had Ray Charles playing at the, at the Hogan Campus [Hogan Campus Center, Worcester, Massachusetts], at the, or the field, at the Hart field house [Hart Recreation Center, Worcester, Massachusetts], or whatever it was called.
Speaker 2: At Holy Cross?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Holy Cross. It's that, that weekend. They brought some, brought a bunch of athletes in and I met my roommate, guy named Eddie Jenkins [HistoryMaker Eddie Jenkins, Jr.], my eventual roommate who would go pro and played on, ended on both, on the Miami [Miami Dolphins] Super Bowl  team that went, went 17 and 0. I met Stan Grayson [Stanley E. Grayson], who was Mr. Detroit Basketball or something. And we, we, and we hit off and we said, "You know what, let's, let's come to school together." And it was all male. This a bi- this a heavy number for me. This was a all-male Catholic school, okay. And the notion my going to a all-boys school at this stage in my life up on a hill in Worcester [Massachusetts]. But, I liked the guys and I said, you know what? I said, I might go out to Pitt and end up in trouble or something. And I was thinking about things like that. I would think about trying to put myself in, in environments that might mini- minimize trouble (laughter). So, I mean, it's a cute little story because I didn't know if I could break my contract. I had signed with Pitt and I didn't know if I could break the contract. So I said I wanted a lawyer to tell me if I could break it. And Holy Cross said we'll, we'll, we'll get you a lawyer, and they got me the greatest lawyer of his generation, Edward Bennett Williams. And so I'm seventeen years old now, and they have Edward Bennett Williams call me now. I'll be honest. I didn't know Edward Bennett Williams was a great lawyer. He was the president of the Washington Redskins, though--that meant everything to me 'cause I was a fervent Red- Redskin fan. And so the guy involved with the Redskins called, and he told me I could break the contract. And so I broke the contract--and stayed friends with Williams right up until he died. And he became one of my mentors, looked after me in terms of advice and kind of became one of my heroes. But, again, like I said, it was one of my Forrest Gump moments. And then I went to Holy Cross and came in in that period when you look back--it was only nineteen of us came in the first year, came in together. Out of that class of those people who came in in the fall of '68 [1968], we have a U.S. Supreme Court justice. We have Ed Jones [Edward P. Jones], who won the Pulitzer Prize [Pulitzer Prize for Fiction] for 'The Known World.'  Ed Jenkins went on to become a member of the only NFL [National Football League] team to go 17 and 0. Stan Grayson became the deputy mayor of New York [New York] and now is the president of M.R. Beal [M.R. Beal and Company]. I did okay. Had a guy named Malcolm Joseph [Malcolm N. Joseph III], black kid from the Bronx [New York]--became the flight surgeon on Air Force Two. I mean it was amazing--if you look at it, nineteen people, so somebody, somebody said once, "Well, either Holy Cross will drive you crazy or you'll do well." And, and there were some kids that did go crazy. I--but, statistically, it doesn't make any sense out of that small class.
Speaker 2: When you say nineteen, nineteen black?
Speaker 1: Black, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Black, okay. Now their other--
Speaker 1: And I count Clarence [Clarence Thomas]. Clarence really was a year ahead of me.
Speaker 2: Ahead of you, right.
Speaker 1: But we came in together. Because what happened, Clarence was going to be a priest. And so Clarence was from Savannah [Georgia]. He went to St. Pius High School [St. Pius X High School, Savannah, Georgia]. And when he left St. Pius, he went to a seminary in Missouri to become a priest. And when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated in April of his first year in the seminary, April of '68 [1968], the white kids teased Clarence about the assassination. And Clarence got mad and quit the seminary. He finished out his year and transferred into Holy Cross. So Clarence came in with me, but he had that year at the seminary. So he got--I got out in '72 [1972] and Clarence graduated in '71 [1971], but we were together for three years. We came in together.
Story_ID: 542747
Speaker 1: Okay, when colleges signed you, is it, does it still work that same way today? I mean, how did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, but I quit. You're, you're talking about in, in terms of athletics.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right. When you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: When you, when you came in, how, how did that whole process, how did the whole recruitment process work, you know what I mean?
Speaker 2: Well, okay.
Speaker 1: And you were, and even you said you had some offers in junior year? Or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I mean, hey, if you were good enough, they, people started identifying you and, you know, you couldn't sign 'til senior year, but you knew you had a scholarship. I remember, I remember when the guy came from Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia]. I'll never forget. I forget the guy's name, but he came in this shark skin suit and had a Cadillac. And he sat in the living room, and my mother [Phyllis Wells] liked him on one hand 'cause he's from Virginia. But when the guy left, she, you know, she a little concerned 'cause the guy was dressed just a little too fancy. And she was concerned about who was gonna take care of her son. And she said, "No, I don't think I want you to play for that guy." And the first time I was on the airplane with her went to University of Pittsburgh [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], first time. Never had been on a plane. And, you know, first they come--usually they come, they meet you at your high school or at your house, talk to your parents, take you out to dinner. I mean, that was really the first time I had been to a real fancy restaurant. And, and then they paid for you to go to the school. And I remember the week before I went to Pitt I went to Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania]. And I went with my, my left tackle, my, one of my best friends, great guy, Earle Matory [William Earle Matory, Jr.], and who I had been with since kindergarten. And, and brilliant, brilliant guy--one of the best athletes who could have gone pro. And his father [William Earle Matory, Sr.] was a doctor. And we, and we met kind of, it was kind of funny because we met at Rudolph [Rudolph Elementary School, Washington, D.C.] and it was kindergarten or first grade. But his father was a intern then. So they lived in a little apartment right, right, right around the corner from Rudolph. Then they, when he went to Tokyo [Japan] for--Bob went to Tokyo for something and he came back. So by the time we're in high school, they were living up in what I called it, in the big house over on North Portal Estates [Washington, D.C.] on the other side of Georgia Avenue. But we've always stayed friends--junior high, high school, even, even though he was kind of moving up different patterns, he stayed in that same school district. And so anyway, so Earle was the best, one of the best tackles in the country. He was also brilliant. And Joe Paterno desperately wanted Earle. He was willing to take me, but he wanted Earle desperately. And I'll never forget we went on the trip and they kind of split the kids up into what I'll call the super athletes and the good athletes. And Earle went with the super athletes and I went with the good athletes. And I remember Earle got mad 'cause he thought Paterno had disrespected me. And he turned around, said, "No, I'm not gonna play that. I don't think the man treated you with the right respect." And--
Speaker 1: This was at Penn State?
Speaker 2: This is at Penn State. This, this was Paterno. And I'll never--and Earle died a few, maybe two years ago, and actually it was funny--I for- I forgot about it. His father, Dr. Matory, was still alive, remembered it, and, and actually put it, it was in the, not the obituary, but it was in the, it was in the program. And I spoke--the, the--they had the program at, at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] at the, at the chapel. And I spoke, and I, I didn't remember 'til I read it then, and I spoke about it 'cause I, I hadn't thought about it in thirty years or more. And Earle went on--I signed with Pitt, and I tried to get Earle to come to Pitt with me, but Earle--he didn't need the scholarship. His, his, his father was a doctor, and he went to Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut]. And he was--made all-Ivy at Yale and then went with the--got tryout with the Redskins [Washington Redskins] but didn't make it. But I think if he had gone to a bigger school, had different training, he probably would have--believe 'cause was just a great athlete. But he died of a diabetic coma a few years ago. He became a plastic surgeon, went to Howard med school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.]. He was a great guy, great guy.
Story_ID: 542748
Speaker 1: So when you signed, how much did they offer you?
Speaker 2: Well, no, what you--you signed, you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They're just a scholarship--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --just a scholarship.
Speaker 2: Back then, back then--
Speaker 1: It was a schol- a full ride.
Speaker 2: Yeah, back then you got four years, full ride, room and board, and you got so much a month for your laundry--maybe it was fifteen dollars, twenty dollars. See that's what the kids are yelling about today. And they ought to do something about it because what happens--if you take kids that don't come from any, don't have any financial means, just giving them a scholarship is not enough 'cause it--you, you need money, you need some money in your pocket. And that's why these kids end up getting in trouble, stealing stuff, or taking jobs under the table. They don't have any money, okay. So, I mean, you know, the only money I had in the world--my mother [Phyllis Wells] didn't have money to give me. So I would work during the summer. But they, yeah, back then they gave you--it was fifteen to twenty dollars. So all us, we did our own clothes, and we pocketed the money. But that's the problem that the athletes face today. You can go, you know, you're from New York City [New York, New York] and you take a scholarship to the University of Kansas [Lawrence, Kansas] and you're out in Kansas, and you just don't have any spending money. And everybody around you's got spending money. So if they really--I mean one of the thing people saying, they just ought to, if they increase the stipend and give you something that's, you know, based on financial aid, you know, a few thousand dollars a year over the cost of the, cost of education, it would make life a lot, lot easier for these kids. But back then bottom line is they gave you full room and board. And what happened--I quit after my first year. I played--back then freshmen could not play varsity. And I had a great freshman year [at the College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Massachusetts]. And then they--my coaches all left. I was recruited by a guy named Tom Boisture who then became, later became the head of player personnel for the Giants, New York Giants.
Story_ID: 542749
Speaker 1: Now at Holy Cross [College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Massachusetts] when you go there, that's a whole different environment--
Speaker 2: (Makes sound).
Speaker 1: --than you've been in, I mean totally. It's the opposite of, of, of--
Speaker 2: Everything.
Speaker 1: --everything (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Everything.
Speaker 1: So describe that.
Speaker 2: Off the camera?
Speaker 1: No--
Speaker 2: I'm on camera.
Speaker 1: --we're on camera.
Speaker 2: Well, it was--well, first, before school started and you saw the real Holy Cross, the biggest thing, you know, was you defined yourself then at first as a athlete, okay. I was--and Holy Cross then was Division I. They've now, they later on dropped down to Division II. But Holy Cross, you know, our rivals were Boston College [Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts], Syracuse [Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York]. This was, this was still a serious football program back then. And the biggest thing on my mind was not athletics. The biggest thing was could I cut it athletically. I was, you know, what kind of athlete was I--
Speaker 1: You mean academics, wasn't academics--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was, I was not concerned about academics--
Speaker 1: --academics, but--
Speaker 2: --I was concerned about athletics. That was, right or wrong, I was a eighteen year old kid. I had a football scholarship, and the first thing in my mind was could I play with these other guys. And ev- every ath- every scholarship athlete thinks the same thing. You want to know, okay, how am I gonna measure up? So, my life at Holy Cross began in August. I--and I'll never forget I kissed my mother [Phyllis Wells] goodbye--and that was hard 'cause I, you know, my mother and I are close. So the notion I'm going away to college was a real big event in my mother's life. And I get a, you know, I had a plane ticket. I don't remember if they paid for you to, for the first trip. I don't--they paid for you to visit. I don't remember, I don't think I--I think you had to pay your own way. Anyway, I flew to Boston [Massachusetts] and the football coach picked me up. I remember assistant coach picked me up at the airport and then we went to Brockton, Mass [Brockton, Massachusetts], and we picked up a tight end. I don't--forget the guy's name--but I know we went to Brockton. And we got there and everybody's eyeing everybody. That's that first week at camp. There's no--school hadn't started yet. This is like mid-August and, and you're seeing the varsity players and you're seeing some guys like a size you never seen. And it was three, three blacks on the team, on the freshman team, and that was it. There were none on the varsity. We were kind of cracking that wall. It's myself, Eddie Jenkins [HistoryMaker Eddie Jenkins, Jr.], who's--came in as a end out of, from New York City [New York, New York], from Queens, and another guy from D.C. [Washington, D.C.], Jaffe Dickerson, went to John Carroll [Archbishop Carroll High School, Washington, D.C.], one of--he was a sprint champion in Washington. He was one of the fastest guys in D.C. and he was a halfback, and me. And, and we all did well. We all, you know, we all started.
Story_ID: 542750
Speaker 1: And I mean, I'll never forget one of the guys teased me a few weeks ago 'cause he's, he read something and he called me. And I got up there and I started rapping. And, and it wasn't a rap like these kids do, but if you played on a black football team, you had all sorts of rhymes and poems to kind of get through the hard parts of foot- of, of, of football practice. 'Cause football is a, is a game where the glory is on game day, but during the week, it's a, it can be drudgery doing, you know, various calisthenics and what have you. And you come up with all sorts of sayings--
Speaker 2: Can you give me an example, like you remember--
Speaker 1: I don't know, I'll think of something. I'll be, I'll be foolish on TV (laughter) on a interview set. You know, we had all sorts of (makes noise), you know, I don't know, all sorts of stuff, I don't--I--the stuff I remember, I, I don't even know if I want to say it. But I got up there with these white kids and started doing my little rhymes, and they got in, and they were--got into, too, 'cause it's a way to take the drudgery away, you know. And, boy, I remember this Coach Penny [ph.]. He came down on me. He said, "You stop it. We don't do that up here. We make our noise with our pads. We don't want all that chanting stuff." And I remember I said woo, boy. And that's the first time I said, um, I hope I'm in the right place 'cause I--that was--upset me 'cause I love my music and my, and being able to make noise on the field and just talk trash. I mean, we grew up great, great trash talkers, you know. And even, you know, when I came up, you know, you--they did what are called the dozens. You know, you talk about people's mother, okay, I said and, and that was just kind of part of my culture. And it was funny 'cause my mother [Phyllis Wells] she used to--told me, she said, well, she wondered if when I left if I'd come back with a New England accent. And she came up to visit. I had everybody talking like they were from the South. So, you know, but it--well, look, it was culture shock. I remember my, my, my roommate was a kicker. This is just for training camp--was a kicker, and camp was so rough, he left. I woke up one day, he was gone. I woke in the morn- he had left in the middle of the night, man. He came back to the school, but he didn't, you know, 'cause they made the kickers do (laughter) everything, you know. But it was, look, it was different experience. I never played with any--I--you know, the only white guys I had ever really played against was when we played Wilson [Woodrow Wilson High School, Washington, D.C.] 'cause--did--by the time I, I'm getting out of high school [Calvin Coolidge High School; Calvin Coolidge Senior High School, Washington, D.C.], the only teams with, the only white team in the public school league in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] was Wilson. And Western [Western High School; Duke Ellington School of the Arts, Washington, D.C.] still had a few white kids, but everybody else was basically every team had--the rest of D.C. was, was, was, it was basically an all-black league. But we had a quarterback, Tony Loglod [ph.] who was from Hawaii. And it, it was kind of unique not to have a black quarterback. And we used to call him the other. 'Cause remember when growing up, you know, we were referred to as colored then. So you'd have these forms. All of them say are you colored, white, or other? So we used to call him the other. And he's a good quarterback. And, yeah, it, it was, look, it was a different experience just going to a all-male school. It was different. And, I was just trying to survive on the football field. And I really, my, I mean, my first, first round of tests, though, I got scared because I think I must have gotten a D or an F on every test first round.
Speaker 2: Your first semester [at the College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 1: Not the grades.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: No, first semester I ended up--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --with a, with 3.0 [grade point average]. But that first--and to get that 3.0--but the first round, the first set of tests--'cause I was playing ball, and I was totally concentrated on playing ball, and I wasn't studying the way I should have. And I didn't know, really, how to study. I r- I had, I had always been smart, but everybody was smart. And you needed better study habits than I had. But I watched--but I learned quickly 'cause I did not want to go home 'cause there was no--you know, I had no safety net. I lived in a world, you know, I--there was no safety net in my world, okay. My mother's still shucking mail and living check to check and there--so, if I, if I was sent home, you know, I didn't know what I would do--maybe, you know, I, I knew what I'd--probably go to D.C. Teachers [District of Columbia Teachers College; University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.] or Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] and borrow some money. But there was no--you knew you better not flunk out (laughter). And I ended up with a 3.0 average--but--that, that, that first semester. But I remember I thought I was going home that first round of tests. But I learned. And I, you know, I always had a good work ethic, so--if I put my mind to it.
Story_ID: 542751
Speaker 1: So bottom line is they then they fired, they, they--Boisture [Tom Boisture] left. They brought in the new coaches that soph- so I guess that's the end of my freshman year. And I decided, by then I was caught up very heavily in student and really Black Student Union politics and protest politics. And--'cause we were, we were protesting what was--we got up on the camp- campus was not ready for us. You had a--they brought us there, but they weren't ready for us. And we got up there, we were like, hold it, you had no black faculty. This--the people just had no sensitivity to what was going on. And you got to understand the whole American educational system is like erupting 'cause all of these black kids are arriving from everywhere. And then you have on top of--you have the overlay of the Vietnam War is going on. So you've got the white kids are protesting. They're joining the SDS [Students for a Democratic Society]. The black kids are protesting 'cause we don't like the environment, which we're viewing as, you know, close to being hostile to us in terms of, you know, lack of black--you know, there was no, no, there's not a black adult on the campus to talk to. I became the adult. I was eighteen years old, and I was the--it, I was the, I was the parent. Okay, if you think of in--that's true. I was the parent, or one of the parents, okay. There was not a black adult to talk to. There wasn't even a black person working in a, in a, in a, in a cler- in a, in a administrative job, cleaning the dorm. You didn't see a black--it was, it was us and nobody. Okay, you didn't even see black workers. You didn't have a black guard; you didn't have a black janitor. We were in the, basically, a white town of Worcester, Massachusetts, up on a hill by ourselves. You know, we formed a Black Student Union the first month we got up there. And we weren't sure what we were supposed to do with it or what we're supposed to do, but we were de- we were trying to hang together. And, and it was, you know, the, I mean, the, the black students at, at Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York] I guess that September they had taken over the administration building. And so you ought to interview Tom Jones [Thomas W. Jones] was--or maybe you have--who led that protest and went on to a great career at Citibank [Citibank, N.A.].
Speaker 2: I think we, I think we did do Tom Jones--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --I think we have.
Speaker 1: But, you know, so--you know, it's all--the whole country's like ripped me and ripped apart and it's kind of combination of Civil Rights Movement meets Vietnam War protest movement meets hippies, you know. And you have all these different cultures, so you know. So all the schools are like trying to deal with it. And their first reaction is, you know, they're gonna be heavy handed and not have a lot of discourse. And the school--students are pushing back 'cause--and 'cause the Vietnam War empowered everybody in the sense that we lived in a world where we knew at eighteen it was okay to go to war and die. And this is not, and not like today with this volunteer army. You would get drafted. In my sophomore year, it was, it was--I'll never forget that was the year where they did away with the draft and they went to a lottery system. And I remember being in the dorm room--what they did they picked golf balls. Every day of the year it was a, a--each golf ball, they had 365 golf balls and each one had the day of the year and they picked them out of a big fish bowl. So I was 273 and so I had a high number. But I think if you were 112 or below, you lost your deferment and there--and you were supposed to go. Now everybody--they didn't get through it 'cause then Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] came in and started taking the troops down, so they didn't go as high as they thought they might. But that was the year everybody--you had no more deferment. I mean I still have my draft card in my pocket--right now. I carry my draft card to this day, okay, 'cause that was part, that was part of your life. And when Muhammad Ali said the Vietcong never called me a nigger, we identified with that, okay. We were with that program a 100 percent. Okay, we were not--you know, so it was the--these were tumultuous times. And you had a lot of different forces converging.
Speaker 2: Now you said earlier that you had never come across lower class whites--
Speaker 1: Never (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) until college.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: So what was the experience? What--was that at Holy Cross [College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It, it, it, it was, is at, it was at Holy Cross and, and in Worcester 'cause Worcester is, Worcester was a classic--
Speaker 2: Blue collar town.
Speaker 1: --blue collar town on the decline. Manufacturing jobs were leaving. Worcester's trying to figure out, you know, you know, what it, what it's, what it is going to do. This was, this was a rough town with people who were used to being in factories. So it was a whole different element. And you had a combination of that both in the town and you had some students from that environment. And it was, it was, you know, it was new to us. We were new to them. They didn't know anything about us either.
Story_ID: 542752
Speaker 1: And you know it--and because it was a all-male school, you know, we probably didn't have as--problems that people had at other schools with, with, you know, what happens with the women 'cause nobody had any women. So you had to, you know, either get a car and try and visit some of the other schools or hope that the black girls would know that there were some black guys at Holy Cross [College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Massachusetts] and so when the white girls came up on the bus that they would come. I mean, I was different. I had a girl, you know, I mean I had been talking for a long time. But I met my wife in high school. So there's a, you know, she's a huge part of my life I haven't even talked about. So--but--so--but that freshman year she was out in school in Cincinnati [Ohio]. She didn't transfer to Newton [Newton College of the Sacred Heart, Newton Centre, Massachusetts], which is now part of Boston College [Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts] maybe 'til second semester, sophomore year, maybe even junior year.
Speaker 2: Oh, so she transferred, she transferred--'cause I thought, I knew you got married like your--
Speaker 1: I got married my senior year, Christmas.
Speaker 2: --when you were--
Speaker 1: But I met my wife at sixteen.
Speaker 2: Okay, I didn't--I, I, okay.
Speaker 1: My wife is, my wife is--
Speaker 2: Give her name.
Speaker 1: My, my wife's name is Nina Mitchell Wells [HistoryMaker Nina M. Wells]. Back then she was just Nina Mitchell. And--
Speaker 2: So you were--
Speaker 1: --she's from Washington, D.C. And she went to a Catholic school that all-girls Catholic school in D.C. called Immaculate Conception Academy. It's since been torn down; it's a condo or something now. And I met her at a football game in the, in the tenth grade. And she was with a guy on the team and I with another girl and we're going--we, we had a bus. It was after football season and then we had rented a bus and we're going to see the Baltimore Bullets play, what's now the Washington Wizards--back then they were the Baltimore Bullets. And I think we're going to see Wilt Chamberlain. And, anyway, we're on the bus and I saw her and the other saw my girl and I said, "Well, I like her," and she said--the guy said, "Well, I like the one, the girl you're with." And we exchanged numbers. And, and then I called her. I had a guy call her who knew her. And my nickname was Tokey. Everybody called me Tokey. I didn't become Ted [HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.] until college. I'm, I was Tokey from the time I was a year old. And if you look at my high school yearbook, I'm Tokey.
Speaker 2: Is that T-O-K--
Speaker 1: T-O-K, T-O-K-E-Y. And my teachers called me Tokey. And, and I was born in 1950 and it was right after the war [World War II, WWII] and I had these small eyes when I was a little baby and some, some way somebody said that it looked like I was Japanese. And, and they got from Tokyo [Japan] to Tokey. And I, and I was Tokey, as I said, nobody--I did not become Ted until college 'cause I didn't feel like explaining to people in college Tokey. And I figured at some point I had to give up my nickname. So I gave up my nickname. But I'll never forget. The guy called Nina and said, "Well, you know, Tokey would like to talk to you." And I was on the other end of the phone listening and I'll never forget she said, "He's a hoodlum and all his friends are hoodlums." And then the guy said, "No, but he's smart; he's not." You know, "No, he's hoodlum." And that--so they're having a debate whether I'm smart or I'm a hoodlum. And I probably had a little bit of both to be honest with you. But, you know, she finally agreed to go out on a date with me. And we went to the movies. We saw 'Fahrenheit 451'--pretty highbrow movie for back then. And--'cause about books and burning books and, and then we went to--then she took me to a basketball game. Her brother, Eric Mitchell, played on the great DeMatha [DeMatha Catholic High School, Hyattsville, Maryland] teams. And DeMatha had, you know, they were always ranked nationally, one or two in the country. Only team to beat Lew Alcindor, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, in his entire high school career was DeMatha. And Jabbar lost one game in high school to DeMatha at Cole Field House [William P. Cole, Jr. Student Activities Building, Washington, D.C.]--sold out to the DeMatha team. But, anyway, so we started going together by second semester, tenth grade. And for all practical purposes we've been together ever since. And she--we got married Christmas Day 1971. And she went to school initially is a small Catholic school in Ohio, Mount St. Joseph's on the Ohio [College of Mount St. Joseph; Mount St. Joseph University, Cincinnati, Ohio]. And I met some black women at a college called Newton College, which has since merged with Boston College, now part of BC. And I told 'em I had a girlfriend in Cincy [Cincinnati, Ohio], and I couldn't afford the phone bills and she wanted to transfer and could they help her. And these, these women, they helped her. They helped set it up. She came in, transferred to Newton.
Story_ID: 542753
Speaker 1: Nina [HistoryMaker Nina M. Wells] has lived both my high school career and 'cause she was up there, Holy Cross [College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Massachusetts], I mean, she's lived that world with me. And, like I said, we got married Christmas Day '71 [1971]. And she worked for a year for Social Security [U.S. Social Security Administration] and then I said, you know, you just ought to go to law school, too. We're here, we're borrowing money. Let's just both go. So she started going to law school at night. Sh- she went to Suffolk [Suffolk University Law School, Boston, Massachusetts] at night to see if she would like it. She liked it, and we just took out some more loans and she transferred into the day program. And so we both got out of law school in '76 [1976] and came here to New- and I came to Newark [New Jersey] to clerk for the federal judge here [John J. Gibbons]. And, you know, now, she, she's the secretary of state of New Jersey. I mean, she, she could--you ought to interview her. She's got her own story--
Speaker 2: No, no, we, I, I do want to interview her.
Speaker 1: --you know, but--
Speaker 2: But, but I, I find it--I mean, how do you think--and I want to go back, but why do you think you've been able, your marriage has been able to survive all those things? I mean, most people, you know, even going like someone marrying before law school and, you know--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --I mean, or even just the sports thing, you know, even college people don't survive through.
Speaker 1: I'd like to think 'cause we're deeply in love. And she is just a great person and very supportive and put up with all my nonsense. 'Cause I worked, you know, living with me is not easy in the sense that I, sometimes I'm gone months, could be a year at a time. When I tried the tobacco case, I was gone for a year. So, everybody can't deal with that. But--and, I mean, I remember when Nina was pregnant with our first child [Phillip Wells], I remember one night I had to pull all-nighter and she slept on a metal, on a metal desk. But, Nina's a worker in her own right. And, she, she just very special person. I'm lucky. I'm, I'm lucky I met her. I met her at sixteen and didn't let her go (laughter).
Speaker 2: It's really, it's quite wonderful.
Speaker 1: You know, I mean, she sometimes--I mean, she would tell you if she was talking to you. I mean, she sometimes wonders should she have pursued modeling. She could have been a model and, you know, should she have gone to Paris [France] and taken a shot. And I think she, you know, she would have, you know--she thinks about that at times. But she's had a great career as a lawyer and she loves being the secretary of state of New Jersey. Because being a part of Governor Corzine's [Jon Corzine] cabinet because as the secretary of state she is in charge of all of the cultural arts, and she loves the arts, love's it, and is a great spokesperson for the arts. So this is kind of a, a dream job she has, and, and she's very special in it. And everybody in the state just adores her 'cause she just has that energy and enthusiasm about the arts and culture.
Story_ID: 542754
Speaker 1: So here you are at Holy Cross [College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Massachusetts]. It's a, you know, sort of different environment. You're getting your, you know, you're feeling, you know, your--you're getting active. So it's not--you almost went from a jock, pure jock, to being an activist, you're saying that.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: But even though those things have been set earlier on in D.C. [Washington, D.C.]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, the, the sense of activity--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know the things that are going on at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], okay, so--
Speaker 2: And I'm, and I'm a leader, okay. I didn't know I was a leader. But, I mean, we formed the BSU [Black Student Union]. I think there was--when I used the number nineteen, nineteen of us black students came in together. The classes ahead of us at Holy Cross had maybe one or two blacks.
Speaker 1: That's what I want to--okay, go--
Speaker 2: Okay, so maybe there was one senior or two seniors and then there were like two juniors and maybe, you know, two or three sophomores. But all, everybody really, and if you count Clarence with us since he really came in with us, within that freshmen class, we were the nine--we were fir- we were the pioneers. We're the ones changed the place. You couldn't change a place with six people. But suddenly you had, you know, nineteen came in at once. And that--and we went out and recruited--we brought in--next class had thirty-seven. So we were, you know, it was, it was--the numbers, you know, you know, were growing. And I was the vice president that freshman year when we start- when we formed it. I think Clar--
Speaker 1: So BSU you formed and--
Speaker 2: We formed, we formed it--might have formed it in my room. And Clarence Thomas was the treasurer or the secretary. Maybe Clarence was the secretary. Clarence was the secretary. Art Martin [Arthur N. Martin, Jr.] was the president. I was the vice president. And, yeah, Clarence was the secretary 'cause I think he wrote up either the constitution or the bylaws or something. And, and it was a interesting crowd, too, because we had, we had what we called the Georgia boys. Because you had about, out of the, out the twenty maybe you had about five from Georgia, all from St. Pius High School [St. Pius X High School, Savannah, Georgia]. Okay, St. Pius became for whatever rea- some, some nun had a connection with some priest at Holy Cross, and they became a feeder school for black students. So, so we had the Geor- we had what we call the Georgia boys. Then in that next class--don't ask me how this happened--we had four black Muslims. We had two black Muslims from Newark [New Jersey] and two from Harlem [New York, New York]. So here we at a all-boys Catholic school. It not that many of us. You got five kids from Georgia--had a different view of the world--and four serious Elijah Muhammad Muslim--and I mean serious, selling, you know, bean pies, selling the paper, watching what we were eating. "Yeah, you know, brother, you shouldn't eat that pig," you know. I mean (laughter), I mean serious Elijah Muhammad--did not like Malcolm [Malcolm X] in a world where everybody was loving Malcolm, okay. It was--but, you know, and Farra- see, 'cause Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan]--I think, if I'm, my recollection is right--I hope I'm not getting too old. I mean, Farrakhan was the head of the, of the Boston mosque [Muhammad Mosque No. 11, Boston, Massachusetts], if my recollection is correct during those--in school. Those guys used to go on to Boston [Massachusetts] and listen to Farrakhan all the time. But it was a little--you had this, even within the black students, you had this unusual group of people from, you know--you had a set of athletes, then you had the Georgia boys, then you had the Muslims, then you had some guys that were just kind of into studies. I mean it was, it was, it was a very eclectic group even within the group of black students.
Story_ID: 542755
Speaker 1: Now what were the Georgia boys like--when you say that they were different? And was Clarence Thomas--what was he like as a young--
Speaker 2: Well, they, they, they were, they were, they were from the South and not only from, from the South, they were all from the same, they were all from Savannah [Georgia]. And most of them were from St. Pius [St. Pius X High School, Savannah, Georgia]. So they were, they had th- they had a little clique. It wasn't that they were, they were, you know, they were, they were different, but they weren't different, but they were, okay. I mean, they had that, they had their own little, they had their crew. But we were all just--all of us were scared and struggling. I mean, I--and we'd sit and do what you do at a l- do, I guess even in college now, we drank a lot, man. But we didn't drink beer, see. Okay, I mean Holy Cross [College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Massachusetts] was a school that was all based on these mixtures and these kids drinking beer. And then you had these black kids--that beer was not, not our drink. We were wine drinkers. You know, I mean, I--you know, Clarence drank (unclear)--that was, that was his drink. We were still drinking Strawberry Hill [Boone's Farm Strawberry Hill] and Ripple, okay. I mean, I still might have a Ripple shirt. But, we're drinking cheap wine and putting grain alcohol in it, making punch. It was a de- that was our world. And we're trying to find girls. I mean, Clarence fell in love with a young, beautiful black woman from Worcester [Massachusetts], Kathy Ambush--was--I forget the name of the school she was--she was from Worcester. And he, you know, just like I went with Nina [HistoryMaker Nina M. Wells] my whole time, he went with Kathy. And I got married senior, Clarence got married as soon as he graduated from Holy Cross to Kath- to Kathy, and they had a son, Jamal [Jamal Adeen Thomas]. Then he went on to Yale [Yale Law School, New Haven, Connecticut]. You know, I mean, you know, Clarence was a active member in the BSU [Black Student Union] and a good brother, okay.
Story_ID: 542756
Speaker 1: So I wasn't gonna be a pro athlete, so I'd better take care of my grades. And I decided if I was going to take care of my grades, it'd be better to get A's and be at the top than just kind of make it through. I didn't have an attitude of, I just wanted to say I graduated. But to be a top student, you needed to put in top student hours. And that meant working around the clock, like the top students did. So I needed more hours, and if I played football--I mean people don't understand, playing, playing Division I football is like, is like a job. So it's tough to get those hours. And I was involved in campus politics in between being involved in campus politics and studies, I didn't think there was time for football. And again, a lot had to do with the coaches that had recruited me were gone. So it wasn't like I felt I owed these new people anything. And so the new people came in, and it had been gnawing at me, and I quit. And but you get (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You quit--
Speaker 1: --but I kept my scholarship. Back then you could keep--you would keep your scholarship. As long as I kept my grade, grade average above a C, which was far above that, you kept your scholarship.
Speaker 2: So, it didn't matter. For the whole four years--
Speaker 1: Whole four years.
Speaker 2: That's--okay, that's unusual.
Speaker 1: That's okay. I've given 'em enough money. We're even (laughter).
Speaker 2: So let me--so you're saying at the beginning of sophomore year, you--
Speaker 1: I quit the end of freshman year.
Speaker 2: The end of freshman--oh--
Speaker 1: The coaches left at the end of the season--the coaches left around February or maybe even right after--the coaches left right after the season. So, say the coaches left in December. And they had to bring in--you always had to bring in new coaching staff quickly 'cause you have to recruit. And they brought in the new coaches. I don't even remember. And, and someone, we could have gone with Boisture [Tom Boisture], Boisture went to Tulsa [University of Tulsa, Tulsa, Oklahoma]. And we, you know, we even had discussions. Should we go to Tulsa with Boisture? But I wasn't going to Tulsa. I didn't know anything about Tulsa and Oklahoma. None of us went, but he was--but I probably quit around April. It's, you know, it was late into the semester. I started the spring training, and then I said, you know, this is silly. I'm not gonna do this. Then I was--I wanted to study, and I wanted to be more involved in what I'll call campus politics, BSU [Black Student Union] activities, and I wanted to study.
Speaker 2: Well, now was there anyone else who was influencing you? Did--Reverend Brooks [John E. Brooks], did he come--
Speaker 1: No, but I'm gonna tell you, I was influenced by a guy named Ron Teixeira. Ron Teixeira--in terms of my decision to quit, Ron Teixeira was a senior when I came in as a freshman. And Teixeira had been one of the top high school basketball seniors in the country. And the coach, basketball coach of Holy Cross [College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Massachusetts], a guy named Jack Donohue, who was Lew Alcindor's [Kareem Abdul-Jabbar] high school coach. In fact, they hired Donohue thinking he would get Alcindor to come to Holy Cross. It didn't work. Well, he recruited Teixeira. Teixeira was 6'11". And Teixeira, while there, didn't like how Donohue coached him, and Teixeira quit. And Teixeira went on and went to the Amos Tuck graduate school [Tuck School of Business, Hanover, New Hampshire], and not only did he quit, he still got drafted NBA [National Basketball Association] and ABA [American Basketball Association]. He was that good an athlete, didn't play his last two years and still got drafted; didn't go. And I remember thinking, well, Ron quit. He was concentrating on academics. Ron was going to Amos Tuck, to Dartmouth's [Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire] business school. And that, you know, that was part of the influence.
Story_ID: 542757
Speaker 1: So you quit. You get active. Tell me what you were doing with BSU [Black Student Union], like--
Speaker 2: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) who were you bringing to campus? What were, what things were you involved with? You were involved in recruitment.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes. Look, our big thing--in the early years, we had two focuses. One to try to recruit and increase the numbers. Two to try to increase the numbers of black faculty and administrators. Those were the two core things. And then you just had, I became like papa bear for the whole group because somebody had to deal with the administration on a hundred, just human problems at human levels. Somebody maybe didn't have enough financial aid, but they didn't know how to navigate the system. Or somebody had, you know, some kind of problem with a teacher or something. And I just became the spokesperson. And that's, you know, how I first met Brooks [John E. Brooks], 'cause he was the dean. Brooks wasn't the president. Brooks didn't become president until like, I guess second, either the second semester, sophomore year or maybe junior year because he was the dean, and so I'm interfacing with Brooks on a million--on a regular basis. And I'm yelling, I'm pounding the table. I mean this is, you know, this is not Brooks as mentor. Brooks and I were on the other side of the table going at each other 'cause I felt I had the better arguments. I said, "Look, you, you know, you brought us up here. You have no--you have not one black adult on the campus, no black professors, no black administrators, you know, basically, no role models, nobody to give us any guidance that looks like us, can relate to where we came from." And we're having all sorts of arguments about the structure of the campus government and how can black students be involved. I mean arguments that even exists today in terms of if somebody is in a minority, and you can't get elected because you don't have enough votes, well, how do you become part of the system? So how do you make sure that we're on certain committees 'cause we don't have the raw numbers to get elected. And if somebody were to try to run and voice a position that was really focused on the needs of black students, that would almost disqualify them because white kids then wouldn't vote. So how do we get, how do we have a seat at the table? And then we pushed for the black corridor. That was the--I remember, second semester, that was the big issue. We wanted a black corridor. We wanted to all live together in one place. We wanted the option, you didn't--you know, it was up to the students. We wanted to live together in one place. That was the big thing, second semester, freshman year. We wanted the black corridor. And because it was, you know, the arguments we, you know, we made, and, you know, and felt sincerely about was it was hard to live on that campus twenty-four hours a day in this all-white environment and like maybe see somebody at lunch or dinner. It was just tough twenty-four hours a day, and we wanted a place of refuge. And Brooks, Brooks said okay. I mean he took a lot of heat from the faculty. It was a lot of debates, but that sophomore year, we started the black corridor. And they gave us Healy [Healy Hall]. And that was really appropriate because James Healy [James Augustine Healy] was the first black valedictorian of Holy Cross [College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Massachusetts]. James had--a very interesting story about the Healys. James and Patrick Healy [Patrick Francis Healy] were the sons of a white Irishman [Michael Healy] who settled in Georgia and his black slave [Mary Eliza Healy]. And he married the slave. It was against the rules, against the laws in Georgia, but they got married. They sent their kids to a private school in New York when it came time for high school. And Patrick and James were part of the first, first class at Holy Cross. I think it was--
Speaker 1: And what year was that?
Speaker 2: Eighteen something, '50s [1850s]. And James went on. So the mother is black and the father is white, James went on to become the bishop of Maine and Patrick became the president of Georgetown [Georgetown University, Washington, D.C.]. Yes, yes. I'll get you, I'll find the book. I'll send it to you. It's a fascinating book dealing with James and also Patrick. And--but the mother, mother was a slave, father was a, was a Irish settler in Georgia.

Speaker 1: And so Healy [Healy Hall, Worcester, Massachusetts] was named after a black person [James Augustine Healy], as Patrick Healy [Patrick Francis Healy] was president of Georgetown [Georgetown University, Washington, D.C.]. And so we had the third, what? I guess, I think it was the third floor. And we didn't have enough black students to cover the whole floor, so some white students came with us. And I think Clarence [Clarence Thomas], I think Clarence may have taken his roommate, and we had a couple of athletes, but that was, that was the black corridor, and we started sophomore year. And a guy named Ray [ph.]--I forget his last name, from New York, was a great artist. And he painted murals, painted this huge mural on the corridor of black, it was like a black history mural. And it was amazing. He was a great, he's a great artist. And so you came up there, and, you know, it's red, black and green and that's, that's where we lived for the rest of the time at Holy Cross [College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Massachusetts]. I think Clarence, Clarence might have gone off the corridor his senior year. I know Clarence--so if I came on my sophomore year, Clarence was there for his whole junior year, and maybe part of senior year he moved off, though I have--he came up with his roommate. But he lived with, you know--and Clarence was not in favor of the black corridor.
Speaker 2: He wasn't?
Speaker 1: Yeah, he didn't think it was a good idea for us to segregate ourselves. It was his view that we had come up there, part of--to have the educational experience, that we shouldn't do it. But he voiced his disagreement, and he came with us, and he lived with us. Look, Clarence was a very activist student. He started a free breakfast program. I used to get up in the morning, at five o'clock in the morning, and ride with Clarence to fix breakfast to poor black kids in Worcester [Massachusetts]. I mean I went to Vietnam [Vietnam War] protest marches with Clarence. I think he said, during his hearing that he majored in protesting in undergraduate school, and that was, that was an accurate assessment. He was a, you know, he was very active in black student affairs and student affairs and a great student, great student, worked around the clock, and would step back to no one academically. He was an English major and his great friend was a guy named Gil Hardy, who died in a scuba diving accident. And Gil was really the smartest black kid in our class. He was out of Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], majored in Greek, the classics, and went to Yale Law School [New Haven, Connecticut] with Clarence. And after he got out of school, he clerked on the--went down to the Caribbean and clerked for Judge Christiansen [sic. Almeric L. Christian] in St. Thomas [U.S. Virgin Islands]. And, but he was in a scuba diving club, and he died off the rock of--snorkeling off the Rock of Gibraltar, right before Clarence got nominated, 'cause everybody has always shared that in terms of the Anita Hill controversy, that Gil was the one who probably could have shed a lot of light on the debate because Anita Hill had been recruited by Gil to come to her law firm--to come to his law firm in D.C. [Washington, D.C.]. I think he was at Wald, Harkrader [Wald, Harkrader and Ross] then. And then when she didn't--at least as I understand the story, and this is all secondhand, she didn't like being at the law firm, and she wanted to go into government service, and Clarence--I'm sorry, Gil got Clarence to give her a job. So, if you read the--you know, Senator Danforth [John Danforth] writes in his book ['Resurrection: The Confirmation of Clarence Thomas'], and a lot of people who have studied the whole Anita Hill, Clarence Thomas controversy, have always agreed that Gil would have been able to shed some light on the controversy. I've never met Anita so.
Speaker 2: In what way, do you think?
Speaker 1: Because Gil was Clarence's best friend, but Gil was also viewed as Anita Hill's mentor. I mean that's how--he recruited her to his law firm. He's the one who put her with Clarence. That's how she got the job, at least that's what's been explained to me. And it's, you know, and it's in Danforth's book and in other books. And it came out during the hearings. I mean they actually discussed that Clarence--you know, Gil, Gil was, you know, it was a very--though he was dead, he was a presence at the hearings because a lot of people knew that Gil was like a missing link. So, but that was Clarence's best friend.

Speaker 1: Now (cough), in your BSU [Black Student Union] group, were there people that were--like you were obviously the leader rebel rouser. Were there others, you know, like, you know, that were saying, were accommodationists, and were they--
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, look, we had a group that was open to a lot of debate. And we debated everything and every issue and it made a, in that sense, a fascinating experience because we had some people who maybe thought our world was even, you know, our view was like, you know, too restrictive, just focusing on Holy Cross [College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Massachusetts], who were concerned with international human rights issues. We had the Vietnam War. So you can't separate what I'll call black political activism from the war. And everything is starting to intersect. And so the debates range from what is our role, what should our role as black students be to the Worcester [Massachusetts] community. What did we owe Worcester? You know, that's part of how, you know, Clarence [Clarence Thomas] started the free breakfast program, you know, in an effort to give back. You know, I used to tutor kids at the, at the juvenile center. What did we, you know, what did we owe to the community in which we went to school? Should we just be focusing on parochial issues like increasing the number of black students at Holy Cross or increasing black faculty at Holy Cross or how should we be involved in larger political issues, at the same time, studying. But, you know, those were those, that two years between the walk-out and the invasion of Cambodia and Kent State [Kent State University, Kent, Ohio], that sophomore year is almost like a lost year for many of us because we didn't go to--you know, we were--between the walk-out and when school shut down at Kent State and we all went to Washington [D.C.] to protest the war, I don't think we took too many exams 'cause it was just that, it was just that crazy year. It was just, you know, and I'm not sure across the country that second semester of 1970 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sixty-nine [1969]?
Speaker 2: --sixty-nine [1969], '70 [1970], you know, not many people took exams because I mean after they killed the kids at Kent State and invaded Cambodia, you know, the colleges went crazy, colleges went crazy.
Speaker 1: You know, to (cough), to hear you talk about it, it seems like everything, you know, the kids are running amuck, sort of, you know, or the country itself, but--
Speaker 2: The country, the country (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) you know, it was running--
Speaker 2: The kids weren't running amuck. Kids, kids maybe were the only people who knew what they were doing. Kids, kids were very focused. Kids, kids were very focused on this war and on the fact that we were the ones being asked to fight this war, and that this war didn't make any sense and that you could not sit in your ivory tower and read a book about political science and World War II [WWII] or World War I [WWI] and act like a war was not going on around you. And kids were setting--we didn't have the Internet, but kids were setting up networks. There were debates. I mean this is the year Jane Fonda goes to Vietnam, and the debates about should we be going to Vietnam? Should people be--you know, I mean, not to fight. Should people be going to Vietnam to protest? Kerry [John Kerry] is coming back. I don't know what year that is. But I'm just talking about that, that's what's going on in this period. And kids are not--kids, kids were not running amuck. This was maybe the most organized group of college students you have ever seen, okay. And I mean people were setting up national networks. You know, marching, protesting at all different levels and debating the level of protests from violent to nonviolent. And on top of that whole overlay of the war, you've got the whole issue of black protests from [HistoryMaker] Angela Davis to, you know, to Stokely [Stokely Carmichael; Kwame Ture], and H. Rap [H. Rap Brown; Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin] and (unclear) and the Black Panthers, okay. I mean, you know, I'm, you know, I'm on campus at a time when, you know Huey Newton [Huey P. Newton] is like a cult figure, okay. And, you know, Bobby Seale and Eldridge Cleaver and this--and these people aren't college students, okay. But the whole question I'm looking at, but these people are in the community, and they're dealing with what's going on, you know, trying to deal with what's happening in Oakland [California], and trying to grow the Black Panther Party, and at the same time, you've got, the Muslims have their message. And you--all this stuff is like, and hitting you, is--no, very organized, not, not amuck in any way.
Speaker 1: Well, when I say that, it was almost as if they had taken over the campuses. You know, I mean the administrations (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'll accept that.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: They were trying to take over, they were trying to take responsibility for their lives in a world where it was clear if you were eighteen, you could go and die for your country. People just had a very common sense attitude, well, if I could die, I want to participate. And that's when, you know, I mean those years, drinking age, everything was eighteen. Nothing was twenty-one. Drinking age was eighteen, vote at eighteen, and everything's keyed off the draft, okay. Now a days, you know, now, you can have this crazy situation where you--some young kid could be sent to Iraq and be given a rifle at eighteen or nineteen but he can't drink and he can't vote, you know.
Story_ID: 542760
Speaker 1: Tell me, what was your major?
Speaker 2: I was an economics major.
Speaker 1: Eco- and you chose that major what year?
Speaker 2: I chose it freshman year. I came in and I checked political science. You had to pick--you didn't have to really select a major, but you were supposed to check a box. I remember I said political science. I didn't know what political science was, but--and I don't know why I checked it. But I took an economics course my freshman year, and I loved it. I fell in love with it, and at one time I actually, I mean I actually considered getting a Ph.D. in economics. I mean I--that was right up until my senior year when I decided to apply to law school and business school. I was considering pursuing a Ph.D. in economics and perhaps teaching. I always thought I could teach.
Speaker 1: Now, what about that? Were you good in math and--always 'cause I think a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes and no--
Speaker 1: Okay. I think, you know, you have to have a quantitative mind.
Speaker 2: Sure, yeah. And I took, at Holy Cross [College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Massachusetts], I, you know, I took, I guess the second level of calculus. And if I wanted to do it, I had enough of a quantitative mind where I could have done it. And I mean, just--I mean the best way to put is, when I was thinking about Ph.D. programs, I was actually thinking about MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts]. I mean so I had, if I wanted to do, you know, if I had decided to go that route, the math wasn't gonna be a disqualifier, I mean, you know. So.
Speaker 1: So, who--
Speaker 2: And my advisor actually was a guy named Joe Fahey [Joseph R. Fahey] who had a Ph.D. from MIT in economics, and he was really my key economics professor. And he went on to--actually, when Brooks [John E. Brooks] became the president, Fahey became the dean. And, but, but Fahey, Fahey wanted me to go on and, and get the Ph.D., and, but it was a real consideration. But I just decided I wanted to go to law school.
Speaker 1: So, was there any kind of economic theory that you gravitated to, you know, was it--
Speaker 2: No, because, you know, no. I did not--I mean you couldn't put me say in the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], Milton Friedman, the school nor- I mean I thought in terms of economic theory more, I was thinking more about issues of social justice and, and questions of income distribution that today, you know, continue to haunt the country. I mean if you look at what has happened in the continuing accumulation of wealth by the top 5 percent of the country and the gap between what workers get and what the top executives get, I mean it is a growing social problem that nobody wants to confront. Periodically, some politicians, you know, try to make it a political issue. Nobody has seemed to be able to capture it so that it has legs because I guess even people on the bottom have this dream that I could be--they could be on the top. But in terms of having a democratic society where we all come together, I don't think you can continue to have the accumulation of wealth at the top at the, at the growth rates that we're having 'cause it's continuing to grow where more wealth is in that top 3 percent. And what are the implications? What are the implications when New York City [New York, New York], the only people who can afford to be in New York are super rich, and over the long run, in terms of having a democratic society? And these issues are--you know, so that's the kind--those were the things I was interested in.
Story_ID: 542761
Speaker 1: Now, where were you working during the summers? Were you going back to D.C. [Washington, D.C.] and, you know, and I'm wondering how even law school, was Edward Bennett Williams still--was he around or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, he was always around, but he didn't give me a--I had--okay, let's see. My first, well, the summer before I went to Holy Cross [College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Massachusetts], I worked for a moving company. And I think somebody on the football team helped me find that job 'cause they wanted me to--they wanted you to stay in shape, so they had me moving refrigerators. And so I worked that year moving furniture. And was, and that was job more than any other job made me decide I was going to study 'cause I saw--a lot of these movers were supporting their family on the same salary I was getting. And that was a rough job. I mean we used to have to take these big refrigerators, you know, three flights up, up the stairs, no elevators. And these were these refrigerators with the motor in the bottom, these old time refrigerators. And we moved safes. I mean, and it was always, "Let the big boy do it," so you know, they were exploiting me. And I didn't mind it 'cause I was, you know, I was a kid wanting to, wanting to work. So I did that before Holy Cross, before I went in. And then the next summer, I couldn't get a job between my freshman and sophomore year. So I painted houses with my wife's [HistoryMaker Nina M. Wells] father was--he worked in the post office on the train, and he also had a little house painting business on the side. So I couldn't get a job, and I painted houses with him. I had this crazy job at first. I was trying to sell alarm systems down on U Street, and I just wasn't able to sell 'em. It was a lousy product. And so I asked Mr. Mitchell if he'd give me a job painting with him. So I painted with him, and I hated that 'cause I hate heights. And, and if you're gonna be a painter, you can't hate heights. And so spending the entire summer up on a ladder when you didn't like being on a ladder, that was a tough experience. And then I got lucky. The next two summers I worked for the National Park Service, and I had a dream job. And how I--some guy at Holy Cross knew somebody at the National Park Service, and I just fell into this dream job where, it was right after the riots. And I guess Nixon's [President Richard Milhous Nixon] the president, and they basically set up what I termed a pacification program to stop future riots. And they split the city up into twenty community parks. And so each park had--I'm sorry each neighbor- each neighborhood had its own park. So you got the neighbor- take D.C. and split up into twenty, twenty sections and each neighborhood was gonna have its own park. And every Friday and Saturday, we were gonna have concerts. And it was really to keep the kids off the street, you know, stop any more burning. And some way I got hired to be in charge of the bands, hiring. And so I was in charge of hiring for every weekend, basically forty bands. I had every band in D.C. under contract, and it was a wonder I didn't go--end up being a promoter or something 'cause it's how your life, you can go to--I could have gone down, easily gone down another road because I did that for a year. And that was a great, great job. And my wife worked part time. She wasn't on the payroll, but trying to keep track of all these bands, I mean I needed her help. And then she had a good time, and then I did such a good job with the community parks, the next summer they made me in charge of the big events for the summer at the big--at the Washington Monument [Washington, D.C.] and at Anacostia Park [Washington, D.C.] and at Malcolm X Park [Meridian Hill Park, Washington, D.C.]. And I'd have like fifty thousand people, African Liberation Day. I gave one program at the White House [Washington, D.C.]. I almost lost my job because I had The Temptations sing, what was it, 'Ball of Confusion.' And Nixon's wife [Pat Nixon] got mad 'cause they were out there on the back, in the back lawn, and it was still during the war [Vietnam War], talking about, you know, singing against the war. And, but they, you know, I, I didn't lose the job, but I thought I was gonna lose the job.

On the front page it, it's titled, 'Jersey's Power Family,' and it's an article about my entire family with a focus in great part on my wife. And it's really one of the most meaningful articles that I've ever read, you know, from a personal perspective 'cause it's not really a focus on me as much as my wife and my two children.

Story_ID: 542764
Speaker 1: So let's go to December of 1969. We're at Holy Cross [College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Massachusetts], and I just want you to talk about what happened in December of 1969.
Speaker 2: Well, it's commonly referred to as the walkout. In December of 1969, it was at the height of the war in Vietnam [Vietnam War], campus protests with respect to the war were increasing. General Electric was gonna come to the campus to recruit. The SDS [Students for a Democratic Society], which was a student organization, very activist against the war, wanted to stage a protest and prevent the GE recruiters from coming on campus. And they wanted to form a human chain across the entrance to the campus where recruiters would normally do the interviewing. And the leaders of the SDS approached myself and others who were leaders of the Black Student Union at Holy Cross and asked if we would join in the protest against the recruiters. We held a meeting. We discussed it. We declined to formally join as an organization. We just felt at that juncture that we had other priorities. We were not against the protest, but we did not think it was in the best interest of our organization to formally endorse it and participate in this human blockage against the recruiters. But we did say that any members of the Black Student Union who wanted to participate on an individual basis were, of course, free to do so. But we were not participating in that protest as an organization. And what happened, you had probably sixty plus white students who participated in forming the human chain. Five black students agreed to become part of that protest, and the protest itself went on for a number of hours. And so they were out there really locked arm in arm preventing anyone from coming into the campus center. And when it came time to basically arrest people, and they weren't formally arrested by the police, but for the college to charge people for causing this disruption at the campus, for some unexplained reason that I've never understood, the college charged the five leaders of the SDS with violating campus policies and they charged the five black students. And we never understood why the five black students who played absolutely no leadership role in the SDS or in the protest itself, why they were singled out, whereas the fifty plus white students who were not in a leadership role were not charged with anything. And this things went on for hours. So the college could have easily gotten the yearbook or campus book and identified everybody. But they came up with this explanation that they charged the black students 'cause they were easily identifiable. Well, the truth of the matter is everybody was there for hours. Everybody could have been identified. So, so the five black students were charged and the five white students. At that juncture, the question became what was gonna happen? And that was really my first legal case. I, I was the lawyer for the five black students in front of the college disciplinary committee. I took the position that they should be given amnesty. There was no question they had participated, but it just seemed fundamentally unfair that they had been singled out and were being put in the same position with the leaders of the SDS and weren't being treated the way the other white students who were in a non-leadership position were being treated which was they weren't charged at all. So we asked for amnesty. Ultimately, amnesty was refused. The college disciplinary committee made a decision that all--both the white students and the black students would be expelled for, I think it was for one year, from the college. Then they could reapply. At that juncture everybody was, on the campus was trying to figure out what were the black students gonna do in reaction to what all of them understood we viewed as a grave injustice. And I think there was a lot of speculation that we were gonna try and take over an administration building. And that was one of the forms of protests that was, you know, en vogue at that time. Black students at Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York] had taken over the administration building the year before. Students at Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] had taken over the administration building. So people were very suspicious that that was what we were going to do.
Story_ID: 542765
Speaker 1: And we held a meeting that night after the decision was rendered that the students would be expelled, held a meeting of the black student's union [Black Student Union]. And I was the vice president of the BSU at that juncture. And there were a lot of discussions about what we should do, including whether we should take over an administration--over the administration building. And someone, I don't--do not recall whose idea it was, someone at some point in the meeting stood up and said, "You know what? This is so wrong, so fundamentally wrong and speaks so loudly about the college's attitude towards black students and towards issues of fairness. We should just leave. We should quit school and just leave and start over somewhere else." And it was an idea that just caught on like wildfire. It just went through the room, and suddenly you had in this room of forty or fifty people, people said, "You know what? We don't need to take over any administration building, occupy anybody's property, engage in trespassing. I mean the best way to send the message as to how we feel is just to leave and we'll find another college." And we took a vote, and we decided we were gonna--we were all gonna quit school the next day. And I informed the college president who was Father Swords [Raymond J. Swords] that night that the black students had decided to resign. And Father Swords, I'll never forget, looked at me in a fairly cold fashion, and he said, "Well, that's your right, but we're not changing our mind." And I said, fine. So I went back to the, what was called the black corridor. Most of the black students lived in the third and fourth floor of the Healy dormitory [Healy Hall]. And I went back and everybody came out into the halls, and I advised them that I had met with Father Brooks [John E. Brooks], and that he basically said, if you're gonna resign, resign. And we went on--I remember I went on the college radio station that night and announced that at ten o'clock tomorrow morning, each and every black student at Holy Cross [College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Massachusetts] would be leaving school, and we would have a press conference at ten that morning. And we spent the night calling our parents, and it was one of the most traumatic nights of my entire life because as one of the leaders, I not only had to tell my mother [Phyllis Wells] I was quitting school, where I had a full scholarship, but I had to get on the telephone with the parents of some of the other students, who wanted to understand what was going on. And I was, at that time, nineteen years old and being put in a spot of trying to explain to a number of parents why their young sons--it was an all-male school at that time--why their young sons were giving up their scholarship because almost all of us were on some type of financial aid or, or scholarship.
Story_ID: 542766
Speaker 1: So we held a press conference that morning at ten o'clock. It was packed, both with students from the college, but also from the national media because no had ever heard of a situation where all of the black students had just decided en masse to leave the college. And it was, you know, front page in all of the papers across the country. And we held the press conference. We announced that we were leaving and we showed up at the press conference with our bags packed. We had, we, we, we packed all night, and people had their suitcases, and we put our college I.D. cards on the table right after I read the statement. And we left. And most people went home. I stayed behind in Worcester [Massachusetts] with a guy named Art Martin [Arthur N. Martin, Jr.] who was the president of BSU [Black Student Union], and we moved over and slept at Clark College [Clark University], which was another college in Worcester. And I forget who--somebody let us sleep on the floor or on the couch or--and we didn't money, we didn't have any money to live, to eat, and Father Brooks [John E. Brooks], who later became the president of Holy Cross [College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Massachusetts], he gave me--I'll never forget, he secretly gave me, you know, two or three hundred dollars so Art and I would have some money so we could feed ourselves. And we stayed around for a week trying to negotiate a settlement, but to say a settlement, we were not budging. We expected, you know, we hoped that the college would come to its senses and realize that they just could not defend the actions they had taken. And ultimately, after a week of national publicity focusing on this whole issue and who was right and who was wrong, the college trustees decided to reverse the decision and to let both the black and white students back in the school. But it was one of the most terrifying few days of my life because your whole future you understood was in the balance, but I will never forget those black students. I mean I think we had sixty-one black students, and my numbers may be off now--I'm talking about forty years ago. But I think only--there was only one black student who did not quit school. Every, everybody quit. It was sixty--so, sixty or sixty-one students quit school including Justice Clarence Thomas, now in the U.S. Supreme Court, Ed, Edward Jones [Edward P. Jones] who won the Pulitzer Prize [Pulitzer Prize for Fiction] for 'The Known World,' everyone quit school. And there will always be a bond between all of us who were involved in what was, as I said, called the walkout because it was really the moment of truth where you had to test your principles and whether you were willing to stand behind them and engage in sacrifice.
Speaker 2: Now, we had covered some of that last time. But I wanna ask a few other aspects of that story. One, what was--who was the person who did not--do you feel comfortable giving his name, the one student, the sixty--the one student who didn't cross the line on--?
Speaker 1: I don't even remember his name.
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I remember--I don't remember his name. I remember his face. He was, we were not surprised that he did not join us 'cause he never talked to us or really viewed himself as part of the BSU in the first place. So it was not a situation where that came as a shock.
Speaker 2: And then what happened to the SDS [Students for a Democratic Society] students?
Speaker 1: They were also given--once the college reversed the position on us, they decided to reverse the position on them. So they got back into school also.
Speaker 2: So that--and who was the president. You said you were the vice president?
Speaker 1: Arthur Martin.
Speaker 2: Oh, so it was you and Arthur, okay?
Speaker 1: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 2: Now, what--
Speaker 1: And Art, and in Art's case in terms of really self-sacrifice and what have you is heroism. I mean Art was a senior. I was, I was a sophomore so this is sophomore of my college career. Assuming we had not returned, I still only had one year in Holy Cross and, you know, a couple months of the first semester. Arthur was a senior, and so he--I mean, so we're talking about in his case, he's somebody who quit school in his senior year, first semester of college. I mean he ultimately went on to Georgetown law school [Georgetown University Law Center, Washington, D.C.] and is a practicing lawyer in New Jersey now.
Speaker 2: That's really an amazing story of collective action, you know, 'cause you hear all these other stories where people were infiltrated, you know, or people start fighting amongst each other (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Story_ID: 542767
Speaker 1: Now, what happened after that though? You know, you were victorious so what is the--what was the--you know, you're coming back, you know, in the new semester. What is the campus like at that point, and what are you, you know, as a group feeling and what is--you know, how is the administration viewing you?
Speaker 2: Well, first the walkout occurred right at the end of the first semester. And it totally disrupted the college such that there were no exams, final exams given that first semester. They shut down the college. After we left, the students, the white students started holding meetings and everything shut down. So we came back in January. We started the second semester, but you have to remember, this is truly the height of the student protest movement against the Vietnam War. So when we came back, it was again, in an environment where the war was still dominant and protests against the war. And what happened that second semester was not unique to Holy Cross [College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Massachusetts] because that was the semester--and now, we're talking about 1970, that was the semester when Kent State [Kent State University, Kent, Ohio] took place and the students were killed at Kent State, when Cambodia was invaded, when they had the huge protest march against the war in Washington, D.C. And basically, the second semester of my sophomore year, the entire college community nationally shut down over protests about the war. So even though we had the walkout which was, in many ways, connected to a protest by the SDS [Students for a Democratic Society] against the war, when we came back second semester, it was this environment where the campus was just alive with the whole notion of protests. And I'll never forget, I actually went to the march against the Vietnam War, the big one in Washington, D.C. We rented a--we didn't rent a car. We had a guy named Jaffe Dickerson, who drove us down. It was me, Clarence Thomas, Jaffe, a guy named Gil Hardy, and we stayed at--actually, we stayed at my house in D.C., and slept on the floor and marched in the protest. But as I said, that second semester, all the campuses shut down. After those kids were killed by the National Guards at Kent State, every--everything just went crazy.
Story_ID: 542768
Speaker 1: So the president, he's having problems after this with the administration I would take it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes, well, what happened, Father Swords [Raymond J. Swords] at the end of the year, that year, stepped down as president. And Father Brooks [John E. Brooks] who was the dean and was the person who had secretly given me money so I could feed myself, he was appointed to president. Father Brooks really was the person who took on the alumni and people who thought the college should not give in to the fact that we were leaving. And Father Brooks went on to remain the president of Holy Cross [College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Massachusetts] for the next twenty plus years and is really viewed as the greatest president in the history of Holy Cross. He's a great man. He's been one of my mentors. He's in his late eighties now. I still talk to him periodically. He's a friend and a mentor, and is somebody who's played an extraordinarily important role in my life. He's one of the great individuals I've ever met.
Speaker 1: Now, you--'cause that article you gave was interesting because it seems like he was a person who came just from a good--he had a good heart and really wanted to make a change.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And he had great sensitivity to the fact that although the college had made what I'll call an intellectual decision, that it was important to integrate the college and bring black students onto the campus and not just have a white, Irish Catholic group of students, that you needed to do a lot more than just make that intellectual decision. The college was not prepared for a significant number of black students. Most of us who came from urban areas, radically different backgrounds from our peers, and it was gonna--you know, they weren't ready for us and we weren't ready for them. And it was a lot of tension, and--but Brooks appreciated that. And when it came to the walkout, I mean Brooks was extraordinarily candid. He said that the decision the college made could not be justified. There's no way to justify it. There were--you could have identified each and every white student who participated just as easily as you identified the black students. They were there for hours. This wasn't something that took ten minutes. And he thought the decision was racist. That's what he said and he stood his ground, and, and he was right.
Story_ID: 542769
Speaker 1: Now, so, you--you know, because you and Art [Arthur N. Martin, Jr.] are the leaders of it, and Art's in his senior year, I'm just wanting to know, that sort of elevated you to a real leadership position on campus if you're already--you know, you were already there--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --but it even elevated you more; not often do, you know, you unseat a college president. So I'm just trying to understand your, you know, what is happening your last two years of school, you know, and how does the university sort of deal with this that they're sort of, you know, trying to get control back because you have to sort of get--
Speaker 2: Well, first, Brooks was the new president. I had an excellent relationship with Brooks--
Speaker 1: So Brooks became president your, going into your junior year?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Correct, and I had an excellent relationship with Brooks and Brooks and I would spend many hours negotiating over improvements and sometimes he agreed me with, sometimes he didn't. John Brooks [John E. Brooks] is an extraordinarily strong man and strong willed person, and as I said, he's a friend and a mentor, but it wasn't a situation where if I asked for something, I got it necessarily. He, you know, sometimes we agreed, sometimes we disagreed. But what was special about Brooks is I always knew that Brooks cared about us and was trying to figure out how to do the right thing. But the right thing for him as college president was he always had to deal both with our needs and the needs of the greater campus community. And I understood that he had a broader perspective, and he knew I had a more narrow perspective. And the question was trying to figure out, given all of the competing interests, how do you make progress?
Speaker 1: You know what's interesting about this story, and it just, you know, I was thinking that this is a, you know, this one--Holy Cross [College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Massachusetts] is an all-male school.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, the story you're telling has a lot to do with the cultivation of a person as a man. And, you know, I've heard that story, but I've heard it in, you know, the Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] environment. You know, it's interesting to hear it, not a demasculation story, but an empowerment story, you know, in a northern school, Jesuit tradition--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --where you know, totally, you know, a case where it could have gone the other way, but it was, you know, out of this, this group came, you know, really a lot of leaders today. So I just--I was wondering why, why do you think that was possible? Do you think that BSU [Black Student Union] had something to do with it? Do you think it was Brooks? Do you--I mean why did that, you know, work the way it did end up working?
Speaker 2: I've just always attributed it to a very unique number of individuals coming together at a moment in time. I, I don't, you know, I've told people, it's almost statistically impossible to think that you could have in my class, you know, you could have nineteen black students and end up having a U.S. Supreme Court Justice [Clarence Thomas], a Pulitzer Prize winner [Edward P. Jones], my roommate, Eddie Jenkins [HistoryMaker Eddie Jenkins, Jr.] was on the Miami football team [Miami Dolphins] that went undefeated. You had Stan Grayson [Stanley E. Grayson] who became the deputy mayor of New York [New York] and now is the president of a minority investment banking firm [M.R. Beal and Company]. And it statistically, it just doesn't make any sense that you would have that small group of people go on to have done what they did. But I think that speaks volumes about their willingness to stand on principle, and that they had that strength of character and commitment really probably, played a lot in the success, successes that they've had going forward.
Story_ID: 542770
Speaker 1: What do you do the summer after your junior year, between junior and senior year?
Speaker 2: I worked for the National Park Service as a, what was--as an events coordinator. I think we may have talked about some of this last time (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, you--and I think you did touch upon that, and I think--you know, you talked about before when you were moving refrigerators, you know, one summer.
Speaker 2: Well, I--
Speaker 1: That was before.
Speaker 2: I moved the refrigerators between high school [Calvin Coolidge High School; Calvin Coolidge Senior High School, Washington, D.C.] and college.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: That was the job that Holy Cross [College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Massachusetts] helped me get to keep me in football shape.
Speaker 1: Right. So now what happens with--how do you end up deciding you're going to, you know to law school? You know, because you were talking about your mentor and how he was really--you know, you were thinking about going to a Ph.D. program, MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Right, right. Yeah, well, Father Fahey [Joseph R. Fahey] was, who became the dean of the students after Brooks [John E. Brooks] and continued to teach in the economics department, and he was--he had a Ph.D. from MIT in economics. And he was one of my advisors and also a mentor. And he wanted me to pursue a Ph.D. in economics and think about MIT, and I ultimately decided that I wanted to be a lawyer. And I also decided to apply to the joint program at Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] on the J.D./M.B.A. program 'cause I thought I would get an M.B.A. also because at that time, at that juncture, I was not thinking about being a trial lawyer. I was really thinking about how to acquire the skills that would permit me to succeed in the business world, and I thought that the law degree and the M.B.A. combined would put me in the best position. And I also, I was up for the Rhodes Scholarship. I was the college's nominee for the Rhodes, and I ultimately did not get it. But I was, I'll be honest. I was competing with the intention of turning it down because I was at that juncture in my young years, I thought it was somewhat outrageous that Cecil Rhodes [Cecil John Rhodes] would have this scholarship named after him, and so I wanted to get it to turn it down. But I'll never forget, I interviewed--I was a, I was a finalist, and I interviewed down at Johns Hopkins [Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland]. And I think they have--my recollection is they interviewed us alphabetically, and I was the last one to go in. And by the time I had spent all day with these other young kids who, the Rhodes was so important to, I felt kind of bad--I felt kind of disingenuous. And I'm not sure what I would have done if I had gotten it. The bottom line is I didn't get it, so I didn't have to ultimately resolve that though it certainly was my intention going in to try to win it and turn it down and make a protest statement against, against Rhodes.
Story_ID: 542771
Speaker 1: Okay, you were talking, you know, about the Rhodes scholars [Rhodes Scholarship]. So you decide to apply. Now where--what school, what law schools do you apply to?
Speaker 2: I applied to like eight law schools, and I got in everywhere but Yale [Yale Law School, New Haven, Connecticut] and Stanford [Stanford Law School, Stanford, California], got in Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], UPenn [University of Pennsylvania Law School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], Michigan [University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor, Michigan], Georgetown [Georgetown University Law Center, Washington, D.C.], Virginia [University of Virginia School of Law, Charlottesville, Virginia] and got--did not get into Yale, did not get into Stanford.
Speaker 1: And of the nineteen that--now how many are graduating that are black at that you know year? Do you remember (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, no, there were nineteen coming in, but there might have been about nine coming out. I mean, you know, we used to say if you can make--you know, Holy Cross [College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Massachusetts] would make you or break you. And it broke some people. It was, that was a tough environment for a young, black student. It was not an easy environment. It was about, about half got through, and those--of that half, people did very well. But I don't want to act like it was easy rowing, and it wasn't. And some students who, if they had been in an environment with more support and more nurturing, who left or didn't make it, might have in a different environment.
Story_ID: 542772
Speaker 1: Now you, you're married at this--you had already--
Speaker 2: (Shakes head).
Speaker 1: No, Nina [HistoryMaker Nina M. Wells]? I thought you had married (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I got married in my, I got married in my senior year--
Speaker 1: That's what I thought.
Speaker 2: --December, at Holy Cross [College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: That's what I mean.
Speaker 2: Yes, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, no, no. no.
Speaker 2: I got married December--I got married Christmas Day, 1971. What happened, my senior year I was picked as one of five Fenwick Scholars [Fenwick Scholar Program], which is the college's highest academic honor. And they pick five seniors every year to design their own program of self-study. You don't have to take classes, and what happened, I designed a program where I was gonna go into study cable television, and I was hired by the Boston economic development department [Mayor's Office of Economic Development] to study cable TV for Boston [Massachusetts]. And so I had to live in Boston 'cause I had, actually had a job there, and Nina and I decided, well, I was gonna be in Boston and rather than get in married in June, we got married that December 'cause I--really, I guess looking back, it was my second semester that I would work and not take classes. So we got married Christmas Day at her house, right outside D.C. [Washington, D.C.], and small wedding, basically--you know, and not to say we eloped, but we told people, you know, we just had her family and my mother [Phyllis Wells] and a guy named Reverend Wiley [ph.] came to her house, and married us in the living room. And then we went to, our honeymoon was going to the Holiday Inn [Holiday Inn Express Washington D.C. N - Silver Spring, Silver Spring, Maryland] on Georgia Avenue, and that was, you know, that, you know, that was the honeymoon. And we always laugh, the great, you know, it's a great story. I don't know if I should tell it on tape. That was the last time until a few years ago that they had the NFL [National Football League] playoffs on Christmas Day. And they didn't do it again for twenty some years because what happened, the second game was Kansas City [Kansas City Chiefs] and Miami [Miami Dolphins]. And it was the longest game in the history of the NFL. They played like the equivalent of three overtimes, three more quarters in addition to the game. I'll never forget. We left her house, got to the hotel, and I got there in the hotel, and I turned the TV on to see if the game was still on. And it was still on, and it went for a whole other half, and I think almost got a divorce that night. My wife was so mad that here I am, just gotten married, just gotten to the hotel, and I'm like, "The game will be over in a minute, in a minute." And it never, it never seemed--they kept missing kicks. It was Garo Yepremian was the kicker for Kansas City [sic.] or Jan Stenerud, somebody, I forget. It's been years, but the game went forever. And the game was so controversial because it went so late on Christmas Day, the NFL took the playoff games off Christmas Day for the next twenty some years until maybe a couple of years ago, they changed the policy and went back.
Speaker 1: Now, what did you like about Nina? What was it that appealed to you about her?
Speaker 2: Ooh, she was just a great person. She was--had all sorts of energy. She was beautiful, but she was just a good person, and we--there was just a chemistry. And we met, you know, when we were sixteen and have always been together. And she's just a very, she's just a very special person. What I liked from the beginning was like what most young boys like. She was an extraordinarily beautiful woman and Nina could have been a model in Paris [France], in a different environment. It was not--blacks really weren't able to crack the modeling game. She had been a model for a couple of the department stores when she was in, even in high school [Immaculate Conception Academy] in D.C. You know, I think she sometimes reflects, if you ever talk to her, well, maybe she should have gone to Paris and then rolled the dice, even though at that time, that world was really not open to African Americans. But she was just--she was special. I knew she was special from day one, and I wasn't gonna let her go (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's nice, that's nice, it really is because you've been married a long time.
Story_ID: 542773
Speaker 1: Are you in Boston [Massachusetts] then when you applied to the law--I mean you're, this is a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I moved, I moved to Boston. We get married Christmas Day. We already, right before we left, we went to Boston 'cause I was gonna start the job in January at the Boston economic development department [Mayor's Office of Economic Development]. So we had found an apartment in Somerville [Massachusetts]. And it was a three family house, and I don't--at this juncture, I'm not, to my recollection, I haven't heard from Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], haven't heard from anybody. But we move into Somerville, in this three family house. We paid $124 a month and it didn't have any heat. You heated it with the stove, and kept the stove open. And Mr. Luc- I think it was Luciani [ph.] or Luciano [ph.]. It was a white, working-class, Italian neighborhood. And we, you know, we were, you know, we were real poor 'cause the only money I had was what I got from the job. I don't know, it was a hundred dollars a week or something, I don't know. But I remember I actually took out a loan to help cover some of the costs, and she [Wells' wife, HistoryMaker Nina M. Wells] was still at Newton College [Newton College of the Sacred Heart, Newton Centre, Massachusetts], which was right outside of Boston, right down the street from Boston College [Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts]. It's--Newton has now since merged with BC so technically now, she's a Boston College grad rather than Newton. And we had, we had--we an old Volkswagen that we had purchased together even before we got married. And she'd drive out to Newton and drop me off at work. But it was--we were, we were poor. We going--I remember when we first got married, we'd be in the Star supermarket, and we'd be looking at the price of this and the price of that. And, 'cause then, money was, ooh, so tight. I remember the car broke down one time, couldn't get the car fixed. We didn't know what we were gonna do (laughter). Those were, those were--they were great times, but, but, but money was tight.
Speaker 1: Now, when you--so you are in Boston when you get the answer about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --where you're going to law school?
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: Was there--did you have a preference for that? Was Harvard your clear choice?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. And you had--was that the only program you had applied for the M.B.A./J.D. program?
Speaker 2: I don't recollect. I'm--I might have applied to Michigan's [University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor, Michigan] program also, but I don't have a clear recollection now. And maybe I applied--I do, I did apply to Wharton [Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], to Wharton's program, and I got in. Wherever I applied, I got in. I remember the only rejection letters I had were Stanford [Stanford Law School, Stanford, California] and, and Yale [Yale Law School, New Haven, Connecticut] which were very, very small. Remember, Yale's class--Yale and Stanford were probably two of the smallest of the elite law schools.
Story_ID: 542774
Speaker 1: Now, do you remember--let's talk about your first year, you know, you're--do you still--
Speaker 2: We stayed there, we stayed all four years in that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And summer?
Speaker 2: --we stayed in four, we stayed for four years with Mr. Luciano [ph.], and he never raised the rent on us in four years. He was a nice guy. And we, you know, we stayed, we stayed right there in Somerville [Massachusetts]. It was, Nina [HistoryMaker Nina M. Wells] decorated the apartment, and we would, you know, except for the summers when I had summer jobs, you know, that was home. And she started, she got out 'cause she had transferred, so she got out, I guess, a semester after me. And then she started with social--with working with Social Security [U.S. Social Security Administration] in Boston [Massachusetts]. She was gonna be a teacher, and so she's working at Social Security, getting up early in the morning, going to, I think the office was in Revere [Massachusetts]. And I did my first year at the B school [Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts], so that--this is now--so hadn't even gone to the law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] yet. So I did my first year at the B school. And I remember I said at some point 'cause I said, "Why don't you just go to law school?" I said, "We're here. Let's just see if we can get some loans and let's just do it at the same time." And she had never even thought about being a lawyer. And I said, "Come on, you'll like it. Even if you don't like it, it's great training, and it's kind of silly you going to work in the morning." And 'cause I took, I would take the car, and she would actually take the bus to Revere. And so she applied to Suffolk Law School [Suffolk University Law School, Boston, Massachusetts] and Boston College [Boston College Law School, Newton Centre, Massachusetts], and she got into both. And Suffolk gave her some kind of scholarship. It was basically a full ride if she would go at night. And she--whereas, BC didn't give her that much money. I remember, and we still discuss this to this day because I told her, just go over to Boston College and tell them you need some more money. I mean all we were looking for was a loan, a bigger loan. It wasn't, it wasn't even a question of a grant. And she just never--she never went over there. And she just said, well, I'll go to Suffolk. So she started at night at Suffolk Law School 'cause she wasn't sure she wanted to be a lawyer. And she found that she liked it very much, and then she ultimately transferred to the day program at Suffolk, and she went to summer school one year to make up for the lighter load she had taken as a night student. And then she graduated, so she graduated at the same time as I did, but she started, the first year she did at night. But like I said, she made up for it.
Speaker 1: Now, this is what I'm--so you, did you--could you opt, did you opt to start at the business school first?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so now--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you had a choice. You could go to law school or the business school. I went to the business school first--
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: --because by going to the law school second, I would at least go through with one class. What I wanted to do, and I was very conscious, rather than never be part of any class 'cause if you start the law school, then you go to business school, then you don't graduate your law school class, but you wouldn't graduate your B school class either. So I thought it would be better to at least go through school with one group of people, so by going to the B school first, I ended up graduating at the same time as my law school classmates that I started with the following year. So that's why I called it that way.
Story_ID: 542775
Speaker 1: Now, how do you get the other courses and the other, you know, for the B school courses? You share courses with the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, well what happens, the first year, the first year of each school, you go to that school exclusively. So my first year, I went to the Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts]. And the second year, I was a first year student at the Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts]. Then the last two years, you're cross registered between both schools, and you're taking courses at both schools. And, you know, it--well, it's a very heavy load. They only let twenty-five people--at least when I was in it, only twenty-five people were permitted to do the joint program in any one year. And it's an extra heavy course load, and it's hard in terms of scheduling. I mean I remember running from the Cambridge [Massachusetts] side to the Boston [Massachusetts] side, 'cause the B school is on the other side of the Charles River in Boston, and sometimes the schools--the classes were not even on the same time schedule. So you had to run back and forth. And it was, it was, you know, a very strenuous, kind of boot camp like environment. But, but I enjoyed it. It was a great, it was a great time.
Speaker 1: Who black was in your class at the B school, when you started? Do you remember?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean we had, there were like eight hundred--at Harvard Business School, I guess there were eight hundred students, and we had maybe ten sections of eighty. So everything was done by section. And they probably had fifty, sixty blacks in our first year class. But in terms of people that, you know--I can't think off the top of my head in terms of names that people would know 'cause I mention them, in contrast to my law school class, which was--and again, this is just in terms of kind of public knowledge. So I can't identify anybody in the B school class who--it'd mean something to me, but it may not mean something to the public, whereas law school was quite different (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 542776
Speaker 1: I wanna go to law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts]. But in your first year at B- at the business school, what--first of all, how do you find that first year? And I know you have economics major. Did you find it very easy or was there--
Speaker 2: It wasn't--I was, I was one of the top students. I was, did very well in the business school. My math background at Holy Cross [College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Massachusetts] helped. Also, that summer before, I remember I took an accounting course to kind of helped me with the accounting, found out I liked accounting. And I did, I did very well and--you know, I mean my problem with not going into business was that I just didn't care about money that much. And now B school was the first year I'd ever been around people who had a focus and concentration on making money that--it was just foreign to me. So it just--I didn't--I hadn't been exposed to anything like that. I never thought about it. I didn't, I just didn't appreciate it. And I went over there, and I, I enjoyed the B school intellectually in the academic environment and, but what I discovered is, I didn't care that much about making money. And I, you know, I just didn't. So I never gave a lot of serious thought to going into business. You know, if I had done it maybe I probably would have ended up going into management consulting, which is, you know, 'cause I enjoyed the problem solving aspect of it. But I wasn't necessarily just into selling things.
Speaker 1: 'Cause how did that, like how did the case study method differ from the Socratic Method, and that's why, and you know, and--
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, I mean the case study method at Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts] is a method that's predicated on students analyzing real life, case studies that have been written by professors and the professors' assistants. So what you're trying to do is reflect on how you would respond to real world situations that have been written up. And in contrast, at the law school, you're reading law cases as opposed to real life situation--well, law cases are real life situations, but the case study was much more or much broader than a specific case. Law kind of builds on a lot of little pieces in order to teach you a lot of different concepts, where the case study method is more holistic because you're dealing with all of the competing problems that might be confronting a company. Though if you're in marketing, the focus would be on marketing problems. If you're production, it would be on the production problem. But the methodologies are different. The relationships with the students and the faculty are quite different. I mean at the B school, the average age of my class was probably twenty-eight years old. I was one of the babies. It's very rare for somebody to come right out of college and go into the B school. So I was twenty-two years old in a class of people, as I said, they were average twenty-eight. You had a lot of people coming back from the war [Vietnam War], probably 30 percent of my class were ex-[U.S.] military people. And it was just a, it was just a different environment than the law school, where you had a lot--where the predominant number of people were right out of undergrad. So we were all twenty-two, twenty-three years old. So it creates a totally different mix. Furthermore, the students at the B school, and the professors were much closer 'cause they were thinking about doing deals together. And it was all--there was this thing of making contacts and networking, and, you know, either how do you run a business, how you become an entrepreneur, but there was this common denominator of money and making money and the professors and the students were much closer, a lot of drinking and socializing with the professors. And you might end up being a business partner with a professor two years down the road. And people thought, people thought like that. But also, again, the student body was much older.

Speaker 1: Now, when you, you started the, the next year, that's nineteen seventy--
Speaker 2: I came into the Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts] in September of '72 [1972] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This is seventy- '72 [1972]. So '73 [1973] is when you started the law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: September '73 [1973].
Speaker 1: Okay. So, who was in that class that, you know, we would sort of know, and talk about that class. And I wanna know who your professors were?
Speaker 2: It was a very special class. We didn't know it at that time, but you had Ken Chenault [Kenneth Chenault] who's now the head of American Express [American Express Company] was in my class, Frank Raines [Franklin D. Raines] who became the head of Fannie Mae [Federal National Mortgage Association] was in my class, [HistoryMaker] Kurt Schmoke, who became the mayor of Baltimore [Maryland] and is now the dean of Howard law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.] was in my class. I mean it was just--Chris Edley [Christopher Edley, Jr.] was in my first year class. Chris ended up doing a joint program, so he graduated a year later, but I still count who we came in together with, as in the class. So Chris Edley, who went on to become the dean of Berkeley law school [University of California Berkeley School of Law, Berkeley, California] was in the class. It was, it was just--who would have known. And then right behind me, John Payton, who should have been in our class but he deferred for a year, who argued the affirmative action case in Michigan [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan] and is a partner with WilmerHale [Wilmer, Cutler, Pickering, Hale and Dorr LLP], one of the really most prominent litigators and civil rights lawyers in the country was in the class. Then Ogletree came, I guess my third year. He came in as first year. [HistoryMaker] Charles Ogletree is one of the great law professors of our generation. It was just very--it was just a very special group of people who just came together. How it happened, I don't, I don't know, but--
Speaker 1: Now, did you--'cause not every else, a lot of people are living on campus. You and Nina [HistoryMaker Nina M. Wells] were, you know, you the--
Speaker 2: We lived in Somerville [Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: --right, you were the married couple.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and it was kind of funny. At the B school, because there were so many older students, there were a number of black students who were married, and they kind of took us under their wing because we were--Nina and I just weren't married, we were newly married. And we were like the babies. And we had a number of couples who took us under their wing, and there was even a group of students who were married, who kind--I forget what it was called because B school was very--I mean I used to, I was in a study group. I used to have to be at the study group at seven [o'clock] in the morning, and you'd work around the clock. And they actually had a group that tried to counsel married couples about the rigors of first year, and I would, you know, your marriage is okay. Just pretend your husband or your wife is in the military or something (laughter) 'cause, you know, very, very hard working environment. And so we lived off--and even at the law school, you did not have as many married couples. There were very few. So again, the schools were very different in terms of the demographics. But we were one of the few married couples in our law school class. And that was--that was rare. But we--because we didn't have any children, it really didn't make any practical difference. We studied on the campus every night. I've always studied at the library--I've never been one to work at home. I, I--in law school, I stayed in the library. So I was in the library every night until the library--the library closed at twelve, that's when we left. And so we both were well known. You could, you know, where to find us, and we would eat our meals very often on campus at the Hark [Harkness Cafe] or more often on the places along Mass Ave [Massachusetts Avenue]. So we were very much a part of the law school campus life 'cause that's where we were, we were all the time. And Nina--I mean a lot of people thought Nina went to Harvard Law School 'cause she was there all the time with me. And so it was, you know, we were active members of the law school community.
Story_ID: 542778
Speaker 1: Who were your professors that first year?
Speaker 2: Let me see, I had Professor Horwitz [Morton Horwitz] for torts, Chase [ph.] for civil procedure, Alan Dershowitz--
Speaker 1: For criminal law.
Speaker 2: --who became a friend and still is a friend who was my criminal law professor, Westfall [David Westfall] for property. I think I took con law [constitutional law] with Katz [Milton Katz] or Kaplan [sic.], I forget. All I remember is I sat next to [HistoryMaker] Kurt Schmoke, and used to look at his notes, 'cause he had great notes in con law (laughter). And I'm not sure who else I had. What other courses? Oh, I had--for contracts, I had Phil Areeda [Phillip E. Areeda] who also--who I became very close to, very brilliant, brilliant professor.
Speaker 1: So what, what was that first year like for you and what--you know, it sounds in some respects that it was sort of like a fish who found water.
Speaker 2: I was, I was--I found out I was made--I just liked the law more than I liked business. I didn't--it wasn't so much the studies 'cause I, you know, if you looked at it grade wise, actually, I think I had better B school [Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts] grades than law school grades. But I just enjoyed the legal process more, and there was never doubt in my mind that I was gonna do some type of law. I mean I didn't even interview--I mean some people tried to get me to talk to some of the investment banking firms and, but it just wasn't an issue. I liked--I truly liked, I thought I was blessed. It was something--I really enjoyed the legal process and studying to be a lawyer. I had no idea I was gonna be a trial lawyer, but I, but I knew my life was gonna begin at a law firm and probably stay in a law firm or on the legal side. I didn't have any desire to run a business, never have.
Speaker 1: Did you ever think about corporate law though as a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Very much. There's no question, not just think about. I thought I was gonna do corporate law. What I--I never, what I didn't think about was doing trial work. That was not on my radar screen until I clerked. I thought I was gonna be a lawyer, but I was not thinking about being a trial lawyer.
Speaker 1: Now, what do you remember were some of your favorite courses there that you took 'cause, you know, courses often are dependent on the professor or some--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean I enjoyed contracts. I enjoyed antitrust, and I really--I enjoyed antitrust very much. I took evidence from Miller [Arthur R. Miller], but again, I wasn't thinking about being a trial lawyer. I remember Frank Raines [Franklin D. Raines] and I used to sit next to each in evidence. And I enjoyed all the courses. I was, I--you know, I mean the nice thing about law school is after your first year, you have very few required courses, so you're permitted to take what you want. And I took independent study with Derrick Bell [HistoryMaker Derrick A. Bell, Jr.], who was one of the few black professors at Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and became close with Derrick, 'cause, you know, what people, you know, don't realize is you're looking for black role models. And I mean somebody like Derrick Bell was one of the few African American professors there, may have been the only one at my time. I mean you're looking to talk to somebody just who looks like you, has similar background. I think, my third year, I think Harry Edwards [Harry T. Edwards] came in and taught labor law. And Ferguson may have--
Speaker 1: I was just gonna ask. Wasn't Clyde Ferguson [Clarence Clyde Ferguson, Jr.]--
Speaker 2: That's what I'm trying to remember, if Ferguson--he may have been on sabbatical and then came back or something. He may have gone back to Rutgers [Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey] and then he came back. But I think, my recollection for a while is it was, it was Derrick Bell, and that was it. Though I do remember when Edwards came from Michigan [University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor, Michigan] and taught labor law, but I think that was my third year. And Ferguson had been--he was somewhere. He was not--
Speaker 1: He was probably in Africa, you think (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't remember. But he came back, and he was not a--you know, he was not a presence in my life. And if he had been there, he would have been. I would have known him. There just--it was just nobody there but Derrick.
Story_ID: 542779
Speaker 1: Maybe I wrote the paper (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So did you do your independent study your third year, is that what you're saying?
Speaker 1: No, my recollection, I must have written the paper--
Speaker 2: Hold on one second.
Speaker 1: --for Bell [HistoryMaker Derrick A. Bell, Jr.] second year 'cause then I was the notes editor for the law review for CRCL [Harvard Civil Rights Civil Liberties Law Review], and I know I was editing that third year.
Speaker 2: So second year?
Speaker 1: My recollection is--
Speaker 2: Seems strange second year--okay, I just, okay.
Speaker 1: You had to do the paper, whatever year--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: I think whatever year you did the--I think the way CRCL worked was--the way most of the papers, I think, were written by two (unclear).
Speaker 2: I see, okay.
Speaker 1: In other words, if you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You mean as in edited--
Speaker 1: --think, if you think how the regular law review worked, okay, you go through first year--
Speaker 2: Okay, we can go.
Speaker 1: --okay, people are--they, on grades. So the second year people are doing the articles. In the third year, they're the editors. So my recollection is I would have done my paper under Bell, which was published in CRCL my second year 'cause I know my third year, I was the notes editor, so I could have been the articles, and I haven't--I was an editor. I was one of the--I was on the mass head, and I remember, I was editing, not writing. That is my recollection.
Story_ID: 542780
Speaker 1: Now you, so you're saying Clyde Ferguson [Clarence Clyde Ferguson, Jr.] wasn't there at that time because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He may have been. He may have come back there. I think he was away 'cause I knew--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: --I knew Clyde.
Speaker 1: You knew him.
Speaker 2: I knew who he was, I knew--you know, but I just have a recollection that he was away and then came back and may have come back my third year.
Speaker 1: Now, you're not, so really you didn't have any black professors then at that time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was just Derrick [HistoryMaker Derrick A. Bell, Jr.], Derrick is--
Speaker 1: Derrick. Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: --the only one who I remember, and I remember Walter Leonard [HistoryMaker Walter J. Leonard] was the, was dean, you know, was with (unclear). And I just can't recollect. I remember when Edwards [Harry T. Edwards] came. And I just have this recollection Ferguson was somewhere else my first and second, and may have come back that third year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was not a presence--you know, and knowing me, I would have had some interaction with him, but I don't remember doing it. So I do have some recollection that he was away. He might--could he have gone back to Rutgers [Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey] to visit or something or--
Speaker 1: I don't--
Speaker 2: 'Cause he came out of Rutgers. But I just--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know.
Speaker 1: Now, when--
Speaker 2: And there were no black women.
Speaker 1: Right, that's right. There were none?
Speaker 2: No, no, professors.
Speaker 1: Pro- oh, no, no, no, black women, no, no, no, no, there were no black women when I was there, no, no, no (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 542781
Speaker 1: After your first year, what do you--so how do you find the first year? Is it, is it--
Speaker 2: I enjoy school.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So I didn't--school was, I loved the first year, and--
Speaker 1: What did you do--
Speaker 2: --great friends and--
Speaker 1: --what did you do during the summer, after that first year? Do you know if you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I worked for two summers for Price Waterhouse [PricewaterhouseCoopers]. And the first summer between my B school [Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts] and law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] year, I worked for Price Waterhouse in Boston [Massachusetts], in the management consulting group. And they really liked me, and they wanted me to come back that second summer between my first year of law school and the second year of law school. And to entice me, they gave me this great deal where they sent me to Washington [D.C.] for the summer and put me up in the--put Nina [HistoryMaker Nina M. Wells] and I up in this great hotel. And it was great. I was working on putting together Amtrak [National Railroad Passenger Corporation]. Amtrak was being formed, and they were the financial consultants to Amtrak. And I had a good time. I mean I enjoyed accounting, but this was management consulting. It was still financial analysis. And I enjoyed it, and it was a--I remember it was a great summer. We lived at the, god, I can't remember the name of the hotel, but it was--wherever Mitchell [John Mitchell] who had been the attorney general and got in trouble with Watergate, his wife [Martha Beall Mitchell] lived in the hotel or something. I don't know. But, and then my second year after law school, I split my summer. I went to Arnold and Porter [Arnold and Porter Kaye Scholer LLP] for half the summer in D.C., and then I went to Atlanta [Georgia], Alston, Miller and Gaines, which is now Alston and Bird [Alston and Bird LLP] maybe.
Speaker 1: It's Alston and Bird.
Speaker 2: Okay. And I had a son [Phillip Wells], I thought I would go--I was actually thinking real seriously about going south. And I looked at Atlanta and that was kind of part of feeling the South out 'cause we weren't decided on whether we would definitely go back to D.C. And I interviewed, I mean I interviewed at Hunton and Williams [Hunton and Williams LLP] in Richmond [Virginia]. I interviewed at some firm, I forget, in Houston [Texas], and I was seriously thinking about going south. But after spending my summer in Atlanta, I really didn't find the South that much different from, from the North and ultimately decided not to go to Atlanta. But, but it was an interesting experience.
Story_ID: 542782
Speaker 1: Let's look at, 'cause, you know, we're talking about really the mid-'70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What is happening and what are the issues, you know, that you're concerned about? Are you aware, you know, are you just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, we, well, when--
Speaker 1: 'Cause you still have--
Speaker 2: I mean what do you have going on there? You've still got the war [Vietnam War].
Speaker 1: Still got the war.
Speaker 2: You've still got the war. It's winding down. You've got--when I'm in Atlanta [Georgia], I remember I met Jimmy Carter [James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.], 'cause Carter is running for president for the Democratic nomination. I remember that summer. But we're coming, you know, you're coming to the tail end of, I guess, the Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] administration, and the Democrats are lining up. So you still, look, you had the Civil Rights Movement is, at this juncture, you know, kind of finding its way in the post-King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] assassination era. So you're, you know, I mean, but I'm part of this new group that's supposed to be integrating Corporate America, integrating these law firms. And what we're, you know, so we're not the first wave, but we're part of that first wave. And people are, you know, starting to see the horror stories of black law students going into these big firms and twenty-four months later, they're leaving. And you're starting to see the revolving door, and you're starting to grapple with these issues of, it's almost like when you go to Holy Cross [College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Massachusetts]. Okay, now, you're gonna integrate this campus, now you're gonna integrate these law firms. And are these law firms gonna be hospitable? What's the environment like? And so we're, at that juncture, you look at the profile of American law firms, you could count the number of black partners in the country on one hand. I mean there was a time when myself and others, we could have named you what black partners were at what law firms off the top of our heads. We had never met 'em, but I could tell you Bill Coleman [HistoryMaker William T. Coleman, Jr.] was at Dilworth, Paxson [Dilworth, Paxson, Kalish, Levy and Coleman; Dilworth Paxson LLP, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]. He wasn't, he hadn't gone to O'Melveny [O'Melveny and Myers LLP] yet. There was a black guy who was at O'Melveny, god, I forget his name. I never met his name, but I could tell--it was like that. You were, I mean you're talking about seven people maybe in the whole United States. And it was--so, you know, it was a kind of cutting era, but, you know, but the stories you were hearing were not good stories. People were not finding these firms hospitable and retention rates were terrible. And you knew 'cause you knew some of these students. These were really brilliant students and something was going on that for some reason they weren't finding these places that great.
Story_ID: 542783
Speaker 1: Now, what was the work that you did with Derrick Bell [HistoryMaker Derrick A. Bell, Jr.], and why did you do the civil liberties--Civil Rights Civil Liberties Law Review [Harvard Civil Rights Civil Liberties Law Review]?
Speaker 2: I don't remember, to be honest with you, what motivated me to want to be on CRCL, on the Civil Rights Civil Liberties Law Review. What I do remember is once I started doing the paper, I remember asking myself, how in the world did I get caught up in this 'cause it was lot of work. And I remember--and I did this paper that was combining some economic concepts dealing with the prices of, you know, cost of discrimination and how discrimination was affecting housing marketing. I haven't seen the article in years. I don't even--it's somewhere that it ended up--it's, I mean it ended up being published in CRCL. It's got a lot of economic graphs in it (laughter). I don't, I don't know if the, if, you know, I'd have to go back now and see if my economic theory made any sense. And it was, and I don't even remember the case. It was based on somebody out of Chicago [Illinois], I mean Chicago economics was kind of coming to the fore then, and trying to apply economic theory to, to law. I think Calabresi [Guido Calabresi] had just written his book on the cost of accidents ['The Costs of Accidents: A Legal and Economic Analysis']. So you know, you had this beginnings of this convergence of economic theory and legal theory, and all I remember now is that my paper was very much laden with economic analysis, and in terms of the--and there was some opinion that had been written by one of the circuits. And I just have a recollection that either a district court in Illinois or a circuit court out of the Seventh Circuit [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit], and Bell was my supervisor, and, on the paper.
Speaker 1: Now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But how I got--what moved me, when I look back with all the work I had in addition to the B school [Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts] to take my second year and be on the law review, you know, be on that law review staff and write the paper, I don't, I don't recall.
Speaker 1: Well, that's--
Speaker 2: What I do recall is being in the middle of it and at some point saying, how did I get in the middle of this 'cause I don't think--I didn't have any appreciation for how much work it was gonna be on top of trying to be in a joint program, 'cause when you're in a joint program, you just didn't--you had to take--I had to take more courses than other people. We were still, it was a very heavy course load. And how I ended up being on it, I wish--look it'd nice to say that I had this, you know, determination to be on what was one of the most prominent civil rights law reviews in the country, but that's not what I remember. I remember, I wanted to be involved, but I don't know what was driving me, and I did the paper. But I was very proud once I did the paper and was made one of the article's editors. Like I said, I don't remember if I was the note editor or articles editor. I don't even remember what the devil, the difference was. I guess the notes were smaller than the articles, but--
Speaker 1: Do you remember discussions that you had--
Speaker 2: I remember John Payton was on it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't remember who else. That's where Payton and I became friends though--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) CRCL.
Story_ID: 542784
Speaker 1: Do you remember discussions you were having, you know, with your, you know, classmates about you know careers and what you wanted to do and, you know, and that combined with the interview process and clerking during the summer (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah, well, what I--I mean I decided to clerk--I ended up clerking on the Third Circuit [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]. But, you know, we were all passing information, exchanging information about what was going on where, at these law firms. And what partners existed. I think, I mean looking back in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], I think you had--when I went to Arnold and Porter [Arnold and Porter Kaye Scholer LLP], Cliff Alexander [Clifford L. Alexander, Jr.] was, was at A and P. And so Cliff was like our mentor that summer. And there was a guy at Hogan and Hartson [Hogan Lovells]--what's the guy's name? He made--just retired. He'd gone to Syracuse [Syracuse University College of Law, Syracuse, New York]. I mean, I mean when I say--I mean it's crazy, I can't remember his name now, but I mean I can tell you who went to school where. You knew because there were so few of 'em--Bernie [ph.], Benny [ph.], he's a tall guy, but he was a partner at Hogan. You had, like, in an entire city, you might have three or four. And in some cities, you not have--you might have none. You know, I don't remember who was a partner in, on that first wave in New York [New York]. You know, there was just so few. But I will tell you, forty years ago, I could name each one, give you that person's background, and--'cause they were your only role models. And you were trying to figure, well, how did they do it? And then secondly, why are the people that went out a few years ahead of us, why are they having problems? And you're grappling with, as all of us do, well, is it the firm or is it us? You know, is there something--you know, what's going on? And so you're talking at all times about career paths and what's the right move. I mean I remember when we got out, both Frank Raines [Franklin D. Raines] and [HistoryMaker] Kurt Schmoke, they went right to the White House and where Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] had just been elected, I guess, president, and they went right onto Carter's staff. You know, so people were trying to again--
Speaker 1: Where did Ken Chenault [Kenneth Chenault] go? Do you remember?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Ken went to a New York law firm, but I don't remember which one, but he, you know, before he decided to flip over into business, 'cause he went to the New York law firm. And I just don't remember the firm--
Speaker 1: Don't remember.
Speaker 2: --and then he left and went with either Bain [Bain and Company] or Boston Consulting Group. It was one of those consulting firms. And then that's how he got over to American Express [American Express Company] 'cause they were a client. So that was it.
Speaker 1: But there's a sense of excitement, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And a sense of possibility, and the thing is that really the, either a clerkship or the corporate law firm is the top of the game.
Speaker 2: Yes, very few people were thinking about clerkships though. That was--there were some, but that was--
Speaker 1: Aren't those usually the law review types?
Speaker 2: They were, but, yeah, but they weren't--it was, I mean I--look, I used to be on this issue for many years in my life. I mean it was rare--well, first, we did not have that many black judges. If you wanna look at the number of black judges in the country at that time, there were very few. Jimmy Carter, one of his legacies was that he probably appointed more black judges than any president. But these judges, we're coming out with Carter. So all this is like happening in real time. So there're very few black judges, and there were very heated discussions about whether there was some type of silent discrimination going on within the federal judiciary because there were few white judges who would hire black law clerks. And so that was, that was a hot topic in--when I was a young lawyer for many years. And I used to be, after I clerked on the Third Circuit [for John J. Gibbons] and decided to stay in Jersey [New Jersey] for many years, I would publicly, you know, discuss this issue in a way of trying to create social pressure for judges to open it up. And it's still an, it's still an issue, even now (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 542785
Speaker 1: But you wanna talk about rare back then for a black law student to have a federal clerkship that was very rare.
Speaker 2: So why did you choose that route? That's what I'm trying--it was counter sort of to your--
Speaker 1: The whole, whole--look, the whole thing--I got, at some point, kind indoctrinated with, you ought to think about a clerkship. And I clerked for John Gibbons [John J. Gibbons] who was Holy Cross [College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Massachusetts]. And Gibbons at some point, I don't know if I reached out to Gibbons or if Gibbons at some point had reached out to me and said, would you please apply. And maybe that could have even been what caused me to go to the law review [Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review] 'cause I wanted to clerk, and the judges were looking--one of the things that judges would look for in hiring law clerks, was whether or not you were on the law review. So I was not on the Harvard Law Review, and maybe looking back, maybe what I thought was, well, okay, if not on the Harvard Law Review, I should be on one of the Harvard law reviews. So I went, and that might have been what happened, though I don't--I just don't recollection really what the driver was. But that, that would seem logical. So I applied to Gibbons, and I'll never forget when I interviewed for the clerkship, he told me that I had a good chance of being hired at the end of the interview, but he didn't know if he was gonna stay on the bench [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit] 'cause he didn't know if he could afford it because he had, he had like seven kids, and it was right, you know, the problem with being a federal judge then and even now is that the salary just had not kept pace with inflation. And so he wasn't sure with the number of kids he had in college if he could stay on the bench. And I remember I got--even when he gave me the offer, it was a conditional offer in the sense, he said, you are my law clerk, but you should know there's a possibility I might decide I just can't afford to be a judge anymore because of all the kids he had, he had in school. Now, he ultimately never stepped down. He went on to become the chief judge and stayed twenty years before he stepped down. But--and that's how I came to Newark [New Jersey]. I mean I'd never been to Newark in my life. I didn't know anything about Newark. The first time I came to Newark was to interview with John Gibbons.
Story_ID: 542786
Speaker 1: So how was your experience with him? You know, he related to you because you are Holy Cross [College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Massachusetts], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I mean, it was--
Speaker 1: And how many--did he have two (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was great. I mean--
Speaker 1: --there were two of you?
Speaker 2: Yes. Well, in fact, what happened to show you--I was his second black law clerk. Art Martin [Arthur N. Martin, Jr.], from Holy Cross, was his first. And, but Art was from New Jersey. So it was very natural. Art was from East Orange, New Jersey, Gibbons [John J. Gibbons] was from New Jersey. So they had a connection. It was--my connection with Gibbons was Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts]. Gibbons was Harvard Law Review, Harvard, you know, Holy Cross/Harvard. And so Gibbons viewed me, without question, as part of his Holy Cross/Harvard connection. And Gibbons at that time was, was viewed as one of the most brilliant federal judges in the country. Gibbons is a genius and was one of the most prolific writers in the country. He was--he and Charles Wright [Charles Alan Wright] at Texas [University of Texas at Austin School of Law, Austin, Texas] were viewed as, you know, the real experts in the area of federal courts and federal jurisprudence issues. In addition to being a judge, he taught everywhere, he lectured. I mean like the following year, from my clerkship, Brad Brian [Brad D. Brian], who was the managing editor of Harvard Law Review. People from all over the country were competing to come to Newark [New Jersey], as raggedy as parts of that city were. And it was not a glamorous city, but Gibbons had his choice of the best legal minds in the country. And he was, 'cause he was just that smart, that special, and he would get law clerks from all over the country. And my clerk was a guy named Jeff--my co-clerk was a guy named Jeff Schulte [Jeffrey Schulte] who was, been on the Yale law review [Yale Law Journal] and so we had two clerks. And I was the second African American clerk that Gibbons ever hired. And, and maybe I was the second clerk, black law clerk ever to be a clerk in the courthouse. And it was years, it was years before there were any others. I mean it was--it was so rare to see a black law, you know, a black clerking for a federal judge. It was, you know, I mean it was a big deal, okay. You stood out like a sore thumb. But within the black legal community, it was, you know, we were--there just weren't that many of us who could talk about those experiences.
Speaker 1: Now, had you purposely chosen--you chose Gibbons and not chose him as--I mean as appellate [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit] versus, you know, the federal?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I didn't even think, I wasn't--Gibbons had, had talked to me and almost said, please, will you apply? Okay, I mean Gibbons was very sensitive, about diversity issues. He was away ahead of his time, always has been. And, and Gibbons was urging me to think about applying. And like I said, I mean when I look back, maybe that's what caused me to go on the civil rights law review [Harvard Civil Rights Civil Liberties Law Review] 'cause I was already thinking about what did you need to apply because my recollection is, I think the only one--place I applied was with Gibbons. That's my recollection.
Speaker 1: Did Art mentor you at all during that, you know, had you stayed in touch with Art or not?
Speaker 2: I stayed in, I stayed in touch with Art, but, nah, he wasn't--
Speaker 1: He didn't like--
Speaker 2: We weren't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay. Now--
Speaker 2: He was not a mentor.
Story_ID: 542787
Speaker 1: So in that experience that year, what do you learn because, you know, on the appellate court there's a more (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure.
Speaker 1: --you know, writing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, and I just had a--that's what, I had a great time. Gibbons and I continue to this day, Gibbons is both a mentor and a good friend. And we just, you know, you connect with certain people. And Gibbons and I just philosophically just, just bonded. And it was because--you know, I learned about the judicial process, but my desire to become a trial lawyer was based in that year, the year I spent in John Gibbons [John J. Gibbons] in Newark [New Jersey] and because I met a lawyer, African American lawyers by the name of Raymond A. Brown, who was one of the most famous lawyers really of his time. He's not--you guys should interview. He's still, he's ninety, he's ninety years old and still trying cases. But he is truly one of the, you know--he was the first black lawyer to kind of, in my opinion, kind of breakthrough. And he was viewed, when I started in New Jersey in August of '77 [1977], he was viewed then as the best trial lawyer in New Jersey. And just, just extraordinarily special and--but I saw Ray Brown try a case. And then Ray talked to me, and I--for first time I started thinking about, you know what, I can do this. And then I started thinking about being a trial lawyer as opposed to being a commercial lawyer. I thought even though I would be a corporate lawyer that clerking in the federal system was good, regardless of whether I ever did trial law because it would help to understand how the judiciary works in the real world of law. And I still had, at that time, you know, I, I've always entertained, or known there was a possibility I might become a professor. So that was part of it also. And that's why Gibbons--and Gibbons knew, Gibbons and I knew that. I mean, and, you know, I mean I taught--I went from my clerkship to Lowenstein [Lowenstein, Sandler, Brochin, Kohl, Fisher and Boylan; Lowenstein Sandler LLP], but I went right on the faculty of Seton Hall law school [Seton Hall University School of Law, Newark, New Jersey] and taught. And I was teaching by the next year. My problem was I was doing too much work, and just hard to be an adjunct and have the kind of trial schedule I had. But I, but I learned so much from Gibbons about judicial philosophy. John--
Speaker 1: Can we, can we--
Speaker 2: --John Gibbons is a historian.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's what I want to just spend a little time with. What was his sort of philosophy, you know, of the law? And what also did you learn, you know, from him in terms of legal theory and philosophy?
Speaker 2: I--I learned from Gibbons to have a historical perspective about the law. Gibbons is one of the great legal historians in the country and would spend so much time reading history and connecting history. And if you ever read some of Gibbons' opinions, you know, they're laden with the history of what is going on at that point in time. And when he would analyze [U.S.] Supreme Court cases, he would analyze them not only based on what was written in the case, but what was going on in the country at that time. And so from Gibbons, what--I did develop and learn to have a, what I'll call a historical perspective about the legal process. And philosophically, Gibbons and I were already on the same page in terms of the federal courts as protector of rights and, and having access. In the year--Sam Alito [Samuel Alito] who's now on the Supreme Court, he was--he clerked with me. He was--there were two appellate court judges in the Newark courthouse. The Third Circuit [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit] is Pennsylvania and New Jersey, Delaware and the [U.S.] Virgin Islands. But the court itself sits in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]. And the judges are dispersed throughout the states in terms of their working chambers. But then all arguments are heard at the main courthouse in Philadelphia. So you go down three or four days a month, and you stay in Philly and you have--and everybody has chambers in Philly also. But on a day to day basis, the judges are dispersed. So in the Newark federal courthouse, there were two appellate judges, Leonard Garth [Leonard I. Garth] and John Gibbons. And Garth, Garth was a conservative judge, just as Gibbons was a liberal. Gibbons is a Republican. He's a Clifford Case [Clifford P. Case] Republican, that's sort--what that means is a Rockefeller Republican. He's a very liberal Republican. Garth was a conservative, and he had a very conservative law clerk, by the name of Sam Alito, who's now on the U.S. Supreme Court. So Sam, that's when I--so I met Sam in August of '77 [1977] when we all, when we started together. Sam had gone to--he had just graduated from Yale Law School [New Haven, Connecticut]. And that year, one of the, one of the big issues in the law was access to the courts, and--I mean I remember I've been arguing access issues with Sam Alito since I was twenty-seven years old. And Sam was conservative then, just as he's conservative now. And, and he reflected Garth's, Garth's view of the law, just as I reflected Gibbons'.
Story_ID: 542788
Speaker 1: I mean one of the big issues in the late '70s [1970s] was what type of access people would have to the federal courts to vindicate their rights. And there was a huge debate within the federal judiciary, and it broke down really along ideological lines about whether issues should be interpreted in a way as to give poor people the right to vindicate various rights in the federal court or whether the federal court--
Speaker 2: Look at me, look at me.
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry, I was looking (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) I know, I'm like, making love to the camera.
Speaker 1: I thought I was doing it right. Oh, I apologize.
Speaker 2: You can look at me, no, that's fine. No, it's okay.
Speaker 1: And there was a huge issue of whether the access to the federal courts should be closed or opened up. And if you go back and look and look at the Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] administration, one of the first things they were doing--and this is kind of part of the federalist philosophy when that organization was just getting off the ground, is interpreting various federal statutes in a way to close off access to the courts. And you saw in, you know, trying to, you know, restricting the rights of people to appeal to the federal courts in terms of how the habeas, scope of the habeas corpus statute would be interpreted. So during that period, there were--this was one of the, you know, very hot issues in terms of judicial philosophy. And Gibbons [John J. Gibbons] was one of the foremost proponents in the country of interpreting congressional statutes and other statutes in a broad manner in order that people could have their rights vindicated in the federal courts, which were viewed ultimately as, as the forums that were most friendly to hear certain claims, be it with civil rights issues or employment issues and where there was the thinking that the state courts were less friendly, especially to minorities. Federal courts had historically been viewed as the protector of minorities. Now, what you saw during a period in the Reagan administration, going forward, this thing started to flip flop 'cause as they began to populate the bench with more conservatives, the federal courts became viewed as perhaps being less friendly, and some state courts, you needed to start to rely on the state court constitutions. So, but when I started clerking, I mean, those were the hot button issues and in many respects, have continued to be hot button issues.
Story_ID: 542789
Speaker 1: During the clerkship period, how many cases were, you know, do you remember being, you know, heard and how were the cases, you know, how was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, well, well, Gibbons [John J. Gibbons] had--each, back then, each court of appeals judge had two law clerks. And we used to have about forty cases per month. And the cases would be split up by, by the clerks really. We'd, you know, divvy it up and try and make sure that there was an even distribution in terms of not just numbers, but, but the size of the cases 'cause some cases, the factual record might be extraordinarily lengthy. So if you had an antitrust case that had been going on for a long time, you'd try to make sure that one particular--that one law clerk didn't have, you know too much of the burden. And you'd shift around. But, so basically, I used to have about twenty cases a month that I was responsible for. And you'd work with the judge on--you'd do what were--you'd do what are called bench memos for each case that was your responsibility. So if the case was gonna be argued or to be decided at a particular date, you had to have your bench memo on that case finished, you know, at least a week ahead of time. Then after the court would sit and reach decisions as to how it wanted to rule in particular cases, the judges would assign the opinions to which judge would write it. So, so if Gibbons came out of a sitting with ten opinions to write, we would then--depending on who wrote the bench memo, you'd be responsible for working with Gibbons on the opinion.
Speaker 1: Which was exciting, I bet, back then.
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 2: --yes, oh, yeah. No, no, and we would go--although Gibbons never took us to the [U.S.] Virgin Islands, we would always go to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]. So we were, so you sat once a month, and we would go to Philadelphia several times each month. And the only time, as I said, we did not go is when Gibbons sat in the Virgin Islands. He did not--it was not his practice to take his clerks. He just thought it was too expensive to charge the judiciary. Technically, he could have, but it was just--he was--even today, he's just a very frugal person. You know, he always took the bus to work, walked--or from the train station, you know.
Story_ID: 542790
Speaker 1: Ted [HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.], two questions, two more questions about that. What was surprising to you, if there was something, about the judiciary, the actual, you know, practice behind the scene, that may have demystified the clerks? I mean I'm just wondering if there was any- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, Gibbons [John J. Gibbons] used to have a saying, "Where you go in is very often where you come out." And I think what he was saying is that, although--there's always a lot of talk about looking at each case on the merits and just that particular case, that your vantage point from how you approach a case is impacted greatly by your life experiences and your judicial philosophy and your philosophy about life and how you see things. So you could have two people approaching the same case, and in theory, all they're looking at is how to apply legal principles within the box of that case, but in reality, they're being impacted greatly by their personal views of the world. Thus, the expression, "Where you go in is very often where you come out," 'cause how you see things is colored by your perspectives. And so what you saw very early is that the law is not sterile and there's not this laboratory setting where people apply these principles to these cases. We are all affected by our life experiences and views of the world, such if you were built in such a way to place great importance on the protection of minorities or the protection of the underprivileged, protection of the less advantaged, that would color how you would interpret a statute or the facts in a particular case. In contrast, if you were inclined to say that, well, the federal court should only be for x types of cases, and we ought to try to make sure that the backlog or the caseload doesn't get too great and that we make sure we don't have--we don't want to get weighed down by immigration cases or something. So you start to interpret things based on that philosophy. And whether it's done subconsciously or not subconsciously, you know, one can debate, but there's no question that people's views of the world on political issues and issues that have nothing to do with the law, greatly impact how they make decisions.
Speaker 1: Was that disappointing to learn or was it--
Speaker 2: No, no, it just confirmed what I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No? It was the--
Speaker 2: --it confirmed what I thought (laughter).
Speaker 1: --what you thought. And that experience has stood you well, really, in understanding, you know, in the work that you've done. Now--
Story_ID: 542791
Speaker 1: I wanna ask, Raymond Brown [Raymond A. Brown], had you--when did you first meet him? Did you first meet him--
Speaker 2: I first met him--
Speaker 1: --in the court?
Speaker 2: --in the courthouse. And he was trying a case in front of Herb Stern [Herbert J. Stern], and Judge Gibbons [John J. Gibbons] told me that he was one of the great lawyers of his time, and that I should go watch him. And I went, and I watched him and introduced myself, and we stayed friends. And he was a mentor and a good friend, and he was just a very special person. I mean he's a character. I mean he is, he is ninety-one or ninety-two years old and still trying cases. I mean I saw him walking down the street the other day when I was over in Newark [New Jersey]. I mean he's just, he's just amazing. And the stories, I mean he represented Bob Carter [Rubin Carter] when Bob--back in, I mean he was, Ray was the president of the Jersey City [New Jersey] NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]. I mean the stories he can tell, and he's just, you know, I mean he's just a fantastic lawyer, and if he had come up thirty years later, he might have been the preeminent trial lawyer of his generation. You know, it's just timing, still, you were limited by, you know, by the segregation and racism. But he was the person who caused me to think, I can be, I can be a trial lawyer and there're no limitations. I mean that's what, I mean Ray Brown, when resorts, the casino, got in trouble, and I'm going back to when Jersey started first opening up casinos. And resorts needed a lawyer and they reached out to Ray Brown. It was like, wow, okay. And it's, you know, and, well, you know, what you saw, 'cause he changed what I'll call the stereotype or the mindset in the State of New Jersey. And I think Ray made it possible for me to get into a lot of cases years later because the race thing in Jersey and in certain places kind of fell by the side--by the road because Ray had already broken that barrier. So, you know, it was not viewed as being that strange to go out and hire a black lawyer for your very important case. You know, I always tell people, the more trouble people are in, the less role race places. The more commoditized something is, the more role race plays. But if you're truly in trouble, I don't care whether it's a legal or if you have cancer, you're looking--if you're on the edge of true disaster, at that point, you're looking for who are the magicians, who are the wizards, who can cure me? And you don't care if the person is black, white, Latino, Asian, or what.
Speaker 1: Now, he had his own firm, Brown, Brown [Brown, Brown and Vogelman; Brown, Brown and Furst]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And the son is--Raymond A. is the father and Raymond M. [Raymond M. Brown] is the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who is Khallee [ph.]?
Speaker 2: --the son.
Speaker 1: Okay, and then there was Khallee, Khallee, is it Khalidga [ph.] or no, it was Brown--it was just Brown and Brown then?
Speaker 2: It was--
Speaker 1: I thought there was a third name, and Khalidga. Okay, but let me--
Speaker 2: And Tom Ashley [Thomas R. Ashley] used to be with him, and, but Tom went off on his own. And then Al Bowman [ph.] was with him.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Now, just one other thing I wanna understand. What--I under- what resonated though that day, if you could take yourself back, that day you saw him in the courtroom. What resonated with you about seeing him? Was it that he was--
Speaker 2: I mean it was the first time I had been in court where I saw an African American lawyer in a major case, and he was totally in charge and everybody knew he was in charge. And that was, and that--that wasn't even an issue, okay. And it was, okay, this can, this can work. And just watching him have the command of that courtroom, and it was, it was electric. And it, it was electric.
Story_ID: 542792
Speaker 1: So, now, is it clear, so, is it clear at the end of your clerkship where you're gonna go?
Speaker 2: No, no. Well, yeah, but it didn't end up. It was clear where I was going (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's right.
Speaker 2: --but it didn't happen that way. What happened--I need to step back. When I got out of Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], I had my clerkship, I ultimately accepted--my senior year, my ultimately accepted an offer to go to Los Angeles [California], to go to Paul, Hastings Janofsky and Walker [Paul, Hastings, Janofsky and Walker LLP; Paul Hastings LLP]. And the reason I, we decided to go to L.A., was after spending the summer in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], my wife and I decided that maybe D.C. wasn't best for us because I was from D.C., she was from D.C. I had a lot of friends. She had a big family, and that summer we found that there were a lot of problems kind of balancing everybody's interests in terms of family and friends in a world where we had for, essentially, the last four years been by ourselves. We were in Boston [Massachusetts], I mean living in Somerville [Massachusetts], and it was Nina [HistoryMaker Nina M. Wells] and I kind of against the world. And suddenly that summer we spent in D.C., and with all the pressure of working at the law firm and Nina that summer worked at the Bureau of National Affairs [Bureau of National Affairs, Inc.], and we just for the first time said, you know what maybe this is not best for our marriage, this--and, but we had, but I'd gone to Atlanta [Georgia], and I didn't like the South. And we said, well, look, I said--this is during the interview season now, third year. And I'm kind of confused now 'cause D.C., we'd always thought we'd go back to D.C. And now we're kind of off our game. And I interviewed with Paul, Hastings in Los Angeles, and I interviewed with a couple of firms in San Francisco [California]. And I liked the people at Paul, Hastings, and I decided I was going to go to Paul, Hastings. So when I started my clerkship with Gibbons [John J. Gibbons], I had accepted an offer to go to Paul, Hastings the following year. And I thought that was it. We were going to Los Angeles. And then after about three or four months with Gibbons, as we became closer, and, you know, he became a real mentor, at some point, he said, "You should stay in New Jersey." And I said, "Jersey." He said, "No, you could have a great career here and endless opportunities, and you really ought to think about it." And, and I asked him, I said, "Well, if I were to stay, where do you think I should go?" And he said, "You should go to Lowenstein Sandler [Lowenstein, Sandler, Brochin, Kohl, Fisher and Boylan; Lowenstein Sandler LLP] and you should practice with Matt Boylan [Matthew P. Boylan]." And I was a little shocked 'cause Gibbons' firm was not Lowenstein. Gibbons had come from a firm Crummy, Gibbons [Crummy, Consodine and Gibbons]. And when he told me to go to Lowenstein and practice with Matt 'cause he said, "No, Matt is the person who you should tie your ship to, and you should stay here. You and Nina ought to really think about it." And I went and talked to the Lowenstein people. And I met Matt Boylan who I had not met before. And he's also Holy Cross [College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Massachusetts], Harvard. And Matt said, you should come here. And the Lowenstein people, you know, started courting me. And they actually had started--it's kind of funny, a quick aside, they started courting me before my Gibbons clerkship just as--there was a guy named--it was Lowenstein, Sandler, Dick Sandler [Richard M. Sandler], a Harvard Law School grad, was in the elevator in the Pound building [Pound Hall, Cambridge, Massachusetts] where they do the interviewing. And I'll never forget. I was in the elevator with him, and I had on a war jacket and some jeans and, you know, you know, he probably thought I was some guy who worked on the, you know, on the staff or something or cleaning crew or something. And, but he was on the elevator, and I just asked him, I said, "Where are you from?" He said, "New Jersey." And I said, "Yeah, I'm going to New Jersey next year to clerk for a federal judge." I'll never forget it. He looked at me, like, "Who?" And I said, "John Gibbons." And I mean (laughter), he looked, and he was so shocked. We're in the elevator. And we struck up a conversation outside, but he recovered quickly. And, and he had given me his card and said, "Well, will you please, when you're there, will you talk to us?" And I never followed up 'til Gibbons started suggesting it. But it was--but I had met Dick in the elevator during a recruiting season. I mean we still, you know, Dick's in his seventies. We still laugh about it. Now, I tell the story, and I say--and Dick admits, he was totally floored 'cause I mean I was dressed, like I said, you probably thought I was on the maintenance crew.
Story_ID: 542793
Speaker 1: And I went and I talked to the Lowenstein [Lowenstein, Sandler, Brochin, Kohl, Fisher and Boylan; Lowenstein Sandler LLP] people, and I liked them a lot, and they urged me to come. But I'll be honest, I was not ready psychologically to say I would stay in New Jersey. I mean I was a Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] J.D./M.B.A., and the notion that I was not gonna go to one of the big legal centers was--to stay in New Jersey with something at that point, at twenty-seven years old, I was not mature enough to confront. I mean I probably should have said, yes, right away. But I just, it's kind of, your self-image, well, god, New Jersey? Newark [New Jersey]? You know, that, and no roots in New Jersey. So it's not like even I'm saying, I'm going home, okay, okay. I had no roots in New Jersey. You know, I had Art Martin [Arthur N. Martin, Jr.], who was, you know, the only friend I had in New Jersey. So we left when the clerkship--so I told Lowenstein, I told Gibbons [John J. Gibbons], I said, well, I've accepted in California. I'm going to California. If I don't like it, maybe I'll come back. And that's how we left it. So the clerkship ended in July of '78 [1978]. You know, I took--I did take the New Jersey bar, so I was a member, you know, so, just in case. And so we go to California. So we get in the car. We've got this old Toyota. Well, it wasn't old then. We got a--we had a Toyota, no air conditioning. And we shipped all our furniture to Los Angeles [California], 'cause the law firm would pay for it. We didn't have much furniture, so it wasn't that big a deal. And we drove across country, and we'd never driven across country. And by the time we got to Texas, we said, you know, this is far. And we started questioning in Texas, whether we were doing the right thing. And by the time we got to Los Angeles, we said, you know what? Maybe we, maybe we're East Coast people. Maybe we should stay. And maybe--we were happy in Jersey, and we, we both, you know, we could see opportunity in Jersey, and said, maybe we should, we should go, go to--stay in Jersey. Jersey seemed to be, to work pretty good for us that year, but we, you know, we were very happy, and that year clerking. And it took me ten days. So I started at Paul, Hastings [Paul, Hastings, Janofsky and Walker LLP; Paul Hastings LLP], and I worked at Paul, Hastings for ten days, and it took me ten days to get the courage to go tell the Paul Hastings people I was going back to Newark. And they looked at me like I had two heads 'cause, you know, you're going to Newark, New Jersey. You're leaving Los Angeles, you know, beautiful L.A. And I just said, no, it's got nothing to do with your law firm. I'm just--all our family is on the East Coast, and though D.C. [Washington, D.C.] wasn't the right place, we were still--we thought, we felt California was just too far. And I'm still in the Paul, Hastings alumni book. I laugh, we were there--I mean I was there ten days. And I called the Lowenstein people, and they were very happy. And, in fact, I needed a loan. We had no money. I had to get the furniture back now. And I needed some money really to get back, and they gave me a loan--they never asked me to pay it back, to get my furniture back and get resettled. And I started in, at Lowenstein maybe in October of '78 [1978], if that sounds right, yeah. So we drove, you know, so we, we spent the summer being very confused and came back, moved right back into our apartment in East Orange, New Jersey, 276 Prospect Street. And somewhere along the way on that trip, Nina [HistoryMaker Nina M. Wells] got pregnant, and 'cause I remember we came back, and then she found out she was pregnant with Teresa [Teresa Wells].
Story_ID: 542794
Speaker 1: I started at Lowenstein [Lowenstein, Sandler, Brochin, Kohl, Fisher and Boylan; Lowenstein Sandler LLP], and about two months later--well, I started, I was in the slash litigation corporate department, cause I still am confused, whether I'm gonna be a litigator or corporate lawyer. And I'm still trying to feel my way, but I've been there about sixty days, and the--two Soviet spies were arrested, charged with espionage, a guy named Enger [Valdik Enger] and a guy Chernyayev [Rudolph Chernyayev], and Matt [Matthew P. Boylan] was retained by the Soviet Union [Russia] to represent Chennai. And Matt said, "Okay, this is what I hired you for." He said, "Come on, you're gonna be my main associate on this case." And it was a huge national case. It was a show trial. It was right after Watergate. I guess, probably Webster [William H. Webster] had become head of the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation], and they were trying to increase the prestige of the FBI. And they made a--a very conscious decision was made to have, what I'll call a show trial. And there were fascinating legal issues, diplomatic immunity because there was a wiretap. It was this big sting operation, and I'm only a few months out of my clerkship [with John J. Gibbons], and I'm in one of the biggest cases in the country, huge espionage case. And as life would have it, Sam Alito [Samuel Alito], who was co-clerk with me, Sam had gone to the U.S. attorney's office and Bob Del Tufo [Robert Del Tufo] was the U.S. attorney then, and he grabbed Sam. He said, "Well, come on, you're gonna be on the spy case with me." So Sam and I are truly ninety days, you know, four months, something like that out of our clerkships, and we're now going against each other in this huge espionage case. And it was a sting, so nothing really got stolen. The alleged thing was whether they were stealing secrets with respect to the Trident [missile] submarine system. But it was, it was a fascinating representation. I mean we truly were retained by the Soviet Union. Both of these, both of the defendants were employees of the Soviet mission [Consulate General of Russia in New York City] in New York [New York], and Enger, who was the equivalent of a colonel in the KGB, he was presented by a guy named Marty Popper [Martin Popper] and Don Ruby [Donald N. Ruby], and Popper, the way he got connected with the Soviets was he had been an assistant prosecutor during the Nuremberg trials. And he worked on Justice Roberts' [ph.] staff. And he worked with, I guess, the Soviet prosecutors during the Nuremburg trial, and when he set up his practice, he started representing the Soviet mission. So he was a natural choice to represent Enger and Matt, Matt had no connections or anything to do with the Soviet Union. But Matt was just viewed as one of the top trial lawyers. And they asked Matt would he come in and represent Chernyayev, who was like a sergeant in the KGB. And we did so, but then Matt had a terrible falling out 'cause they--the Soviets were always concerned that Matt--that Chernyayev might defect. And they didn't trust us either 'cause we--they had no connections with us. So we never got to talk to our client by himself, you know, in an entire eighteen months of representing him. There was always a senior diplomatic official, I assume, another KGB guy. But they never let him out of their sight. And we went to trial in front of--Fred Lacey [Frederick Bernard Lacey] was the federal district court judge. And that was my, that was my first big case. And we picked that jury in two days, but we impaneled the jury like three o'clock in the morning. And Lacey told them finally at three in the morning that they were gonna be sequestered. And it was, it was a fascinating case. They were, they were convicted, never did a day in prison. Lacey gave them both thirty years, but they were swapped for maybe three or four Soviet dissidents. And I remember Sam and I, we had written the--the conviction had taken place. They were out on bail pending appeal. And I remember Popper called me one day and said, "Well, we just cut the deal with the White House, but you have to go to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] in the morning," meaning me, "to withdraw the appeal." And I remember--and he said, "Come to New York right away." And I was a little suspicious of, of Marty--I mean he's dead now. I thought Marty might swap me, if it would help (laughter). And I told everybody, I said, "I'm going over to Marty. If I don't show up or something," (laughter), "this is where I am." And I went to the Third Circuit [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit] the next morning, and I signed a bunch of papers with ribbons on them, and then they did the swap at a--somewhere, maybe at some airport around D.C. [Washington, D.C.]. That afternoon, went on national TV. So they never did any time. Then we were actually supposed to go to the Soviet Olympics [1980 Summer Olympics, Moscow, Russia], and then, but then Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] boycotted the Olympics. So we were, we were invited to go to the Olympics as their guests, but we never, never went 'cause the, because the U.S. boycotted the Olympics. But that's how I started doing criminal law. I mean, it, it--with the Soviet spy case.

Speaker 1: And one of the things when they tried to persuade me to stay, they were gonna change the name. And I was real close to staying because--I mean when I started the name of the firm was Lowenstein, Sandler, Brochin, Kohl, Fisher and Boylan, then years later, they just changed it to Lowenstein Sandler [Lowenstein Sandler LLP] and shortened it. But then when I was ready to come over here, one of the things they said, they said, well, we'll change it to Lowenstein, Sandler and Wells. And I was real close to be honest with you. I was like ah. And they were always the most profitable firm in Jersey. They had the--you know, it was a powerhouse firm.
Speaker 2: Were there--who were the other players, the firms then? It was--were there other (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) McCarter was the biggest firm, McCarter and English [McCarter and English LLP], was kind of old line. It was McCarter and Riker, Danzig [Riker, Danzig, Scherer, Hyland and Perretti LLP] and then the Lowenstein firm, though, quickly became--once Alan [Alan V. Lowenstein] broke away from Riker and formed his firm, they quickly became one of the stars of the state, and they had the legal talent. And they would--basically, I was the only Harvard guy that wasn't, didn't have Jersey [New Jersey] roots that was there. But most of the firm was a bunch of Harvard lawyers, Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] grads, and that became the place.
Speaker 2: Now, and by the time you joined, they had been around for twenty, twenty-two years?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right, that's right.
Speaker 2: So, it was not--right.
Speaker 1: Oh, no, no, no, this was not a start-up. They were--
Speaker 2: No, no. Now, let me ask, what are you learning from Boylan at this time, you know, Matt Boylan [Matthew P. Boylan]? What are you, because I mean first of all that sounds like just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, I became--
Speaker 2: --it sounds like such an exciting--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I became, I became Matt's law guy. I was his writer. I did his briefs. But I did more than the briefs. I, I--I really formed the defense. And what I discovered--and we both did, and nobody knew it, is I had a gift for strategic thinking in terms of how to prepare a case and where--and how to prepare a defense strategy. And so not only was I doing the pretrial motions, but I was mapping out the themes, and how we're gonna try it. And Matt--I was, I was the writer. And I kept the clients happy, and then Matt would come in and try the case. And while I was doing that--so I would get my own trial experience, I started working with, doing Criminal Justice Act [Criminal Justice Act of 1964] work, which was the federal statute that deals with making sure that indigents, people who don't have money for lawyers, have trial counsel, and I started doing a lot of CJA work. So I'm, so I'm working with Matt and developing at a very early age, very quickly, a pretty good rep in the state as a legal strategist and brief writer. And I would argue, and Matt would let me--that's the great thing about Matt, Matt would let you argue your own motions. So subject to say political issues of Matt had to argue this, you know, it was understood, not only was I writing the briefs, I was arguing them. So I mean, I did, I was doing witnesses, I did witnesses in the Russian spy case, a few months out of my clerkship in part 'cause Matt got so mad at the Soviets. Matt just could not, you know, in hindsight, maybe he never should have agreed to represent the Soviets. He hated the Soviets. Maybe he shouldn't have agreed to do it, and then when they wouldn't let him even talk to his client by himself, he got mad and almost--I almost did, ended up running the case, you know, myself, me and the co-counsel for Don Ruby [Donald N. Ruby] who was Popper's [Martin Popper] partner. But, but so, I'm writing, learning how to try cases, watching Matt, but also doing my own cases. And back then, you could do a lot of Criminal Justice Act work.  A lot of drugs were coming into New Jersey. Jersey's, Jersey, in terms of drugs, the whole, you know, a lot of drugs come into southern Jersey, so, I mean I used to do a lot of big marijuana cases, hashish--when I say cases, I'm talking about forty tons. I'm not talking about small cases. I'm talking about ship cases. I became, at one point, an expert on the Fourth Amendment--application of the Fourth Amendment to the high seas and so I'm doing a lot of drug work and big multi-defendant cases with a lot of CJA lawyers who I grew up with, you know, really 'cause--and, you know, doing bank robberies 'cause--
Speaker 2: Now, are you doing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) there used to be a lot of bank robbery cases on this--the feds used to prosecute a lot of bank robbery cases. They don't now. Most of that now is on the state side.
Story_ID: 542796
Speaker 1: Now are you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I did, I did one of the early RICO [Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1970] cases. The first RICO--RICO had just been passed. One of the big RICO cases they brought against the New World of Islam. And it was nineteen African American Muslims who were charged with, engaged--being engaged in a series of bank robberies to establish a separatist community in South Carolina. And Herb Stern [Herbert J. Stern] was the judge, and he appointed me to represent the lead defendant, a guy named Al Dickens, AKA Muhammad Ali [sic. Ali Mahdi Muhammad]. And he was the leader of the group, and I mean it was a huge case. They were scared. These guys, I mean--they weren't just robbing banks. People had been killed during the bank robberies, vicious. These, these were--they were like the early terrorists. And they were so concerned about security in that case, they brought in--they only had like twenty black marshals [U.S. Marshals Service] in the United States. And there were nineteen defendants. And they had--we had nineteen--of the twenty black marshals, we had nineteen of them brought into Newark [New Jersey]. That's how I learned--I met all of the like--at a young age, I met all the black marshals (laughter) in the country because of the Dickens' case, cause these guys, they were, I mean, they were scary. And Dickens had served most of--he had written a couple of books. He was, had been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic, but a very, very brilliant man. And they would not let us put in any defense. I mean I'll never forget I was at Rahway Prison [Rahway State Prison; East Jersey State Prison, Rahway, New Jersey] and with Dickens. And he said, "Look, you seem like a nice young man, but I want you to understand. I'm not participating in this trial. I don't believe in the system. I'm not participating, and furthermore, they've named my church," which was New World of Islam, "as the enterprise. And I'm not gonna participate in a trial where my church is involved." And I finally got him to agree that if they would rename--if they'd take the church out, they he'd be willing to put in a defense. And we went to--we made a motion. I said, "Judge, they will not participate if the church is named as an enterprise. Why don't you just change it?" I went to the U.S. attorney to see would he change the description 'cause it really wasn't legally required. They could have said the criminal enterprise was the group, just what's called the enterprise in fact. But they wouldn't, they wouldn't do it, and it was the most bizarre situation. So they made them all waive on the record. So I stood out--I'll never forget it. I'm, there's nineteen of us, I'm the lead lawyer. And I stand up, and I said, "They will not put in a defense." And I said, "We'd like to be relieved 'cause they weren't gonna put in a defense." And Stern said, "No, you're gonna be stand by counsel. And what we're gonna do is this. Every morning of this trial, they're gonna be brought into this courtroom, and they're gonna waive their presence. And then we're gonna take 'em up to the cell block, and we're gonna put speakers in the cell block so they can listen to the trial. And the lawyers, though, you are gonna sit here and you're gonna watch so if they ever change their mind, you're on top of what's been going on, and we can just keep moving." So we sat there for a month, and--while the government tried these guys in absentia. They'd come down every morning, and they'd get mad with Stern if he didn't call them by their Muslim names. And the jurors never, and the jurors never even saw the defendants. They probably would have scared them. I mean these were, this, it was, it was--it was a fascinating case, but I'll never forget, when Stern was sentencing them, and Stern said, "These men have declared war against society. They didn't ask for no quarter, they have given no quarter," and it was like a preview of kind of--of really a terrorism. And Dickens is hitting me in the back, "Did you hear what he said, did you hear," and Dickens is actually happy with what Stern is saying. But they all, you know, they got a huge amount of time, and I lost, I lost track of them over the years. I used to have 'cause people call and ask me some question about, you know, something, but to a person, all nineteen of them. They refused to participate. And some of them had defenses. That's what, that's what fascinated us. Some of these guys did have defenses, including Dickens.
Speaker 1: So did you try talking to them? You know, I mean you said that you--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, we tried, but their position was--and I don't think they were, you know, that I got them to the point where they were willing to defend if they would have reshaped, reformed the indictment, not to say that the church--that their church was the enterprise. And they could have just said it was, what's called an association in fact, and without--they could have taken the church out. But nobody--look, there had been, people had been murdered. This was a, this was an ugly case. And the government refused to do it, and they refused to budge.
Story_ID: 542797
Speaker 1: So Matt [Matthew P. Boylan] really identified you as sort of a rising star, especially after the Soviet cl- case (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, he--
Speaker 1: I mean how many did he have in his--
Speaker 2: Well, Matt knew, going in I was--I mean, in other words, Gibbons [John J. Gibbons] was Matt's--Gibbons and Matt used to practice together. And Matt, Matt had been the head of the Division of Criminal Justice in New Jersey. Matt was one of Bobby Kennedy's [Robert F. Kennedy] main prosecutors. He was the first one to--when Bobby Kennedy declared war against organized crime, Matt was part of his strike force. He had Tony Brolands [ph.] on (unclear). I mean Matt was nationally revered as a federal prosecutor who had now gone into private practice and had decided to go with the Lowenstein firm [Lowenstein, Sandler, Brochin, Kohl, Fisher and Boylan; Lowenstein Sandler LLP], instead of going back with Gibbons' firm [Crummy, Consodine and Gibbons] 'cause Gibbons had gone on to the bench [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]. And so, I came in. I, with Matt, I was, I was Gibbons' guy, and Gibbons was sending me, was sending to Matt his star clerk. So it wasn't--I didn't go with, you know, something to prove. But Matt and I, like Gibbons, we just hit it off, and--'cause I'm a workaholic, so I'm--anybody, if you can get an associate who's smart and can write and research and is a workaholic, that's, you know, that's--if you're a partner, you know, that's a dream. So, you know, so Matt loved me and, you know, our group became myself, a guy named Jerry Krovatin [Gerald Krovatin] who's married to Anna Quindlen, the writer and a woman named Judy Russell [Judy G. Russell]. And we used to call ourselves the Mod Squad. And we were, and we were Matt's strike team. You know, depending on the case, we'd people, but we were--that was, that was--it was the four of us. We were like the, you know, lone rangers. We'd go off and try cases all over. And back then, a lot of the big firms in New York [New York], not only did not do white collar criminal work, they didn't want to do it. They thought it was something wrong with it. So we used to do a lot of Cravath, Swaine and Moore's [Cravath, Swaine and Moore, LLP] white collar stuff. So I mean we were, I mean we were doing top of the line stuff in an early emerging field, as the federal prosecutors were bringing more and more corporate cases. And so we're being brought in by some of the top firms in New York. So I practiced in--at an early stage, in New York just as much as I'm in New Jersey. And it's almost like I'm at a New York firm.
Speaker 1: But when you were doing the criminal justice cases, were those pro bono?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's--
Speaker 2: Well, you got paid--and I'm going back, maybe it was thirty-five dollars an hour or forty. I mean you got--it had nothing to do, it was no relationship to the real value. But, yeah, they--under the Criminal Justice Act [Criminal Justice Act of 1964], they'd pay something. So let's say today maybe they a hundred and fifty dollars an hour or something. But--
Speaker 1: And Lowenstein, the firm encouraged pro bono at that point? I mean, you know, or--
Speaker 2: No, well, the Lowenstein firm always encouraged--pro bono was a big part of that firm's ethic. When Alan [Alan V. Lowenstein]--
Speaker 1: Even back then?
Speaker 2: Even, yes, from day one. When Alan formed that firm, Alan, who really was a visionary person formed it, he wanted a firm that was based on, on values. And pro bono and community service was a big part of it. I mean to this day, one of Alan's most lasting contributions is about ten years ago, really, and maybe ten years, he put up $10 million to form what's called the New Jersey Institute of Social Justice [sic. New Jersey Institute for Social Justice, Newark, New Jersey]. And I'm one of the founding board members, Nick Katzenbach [Nicholas Katzenbach] was the attorney general, Dick Debevoise [Dickinson R. Debevoise], former federal judge. And, you know, that's just, this was what Alan was about. Alan, Alan was just a, you know, just an extraordinarily special lawyer and person. And so when he left Riker [Riker, Danzig, Scherer, Hyland and Perretti LLP], having been forced out, you know, he was determined to form a firm that just wasn't about money. We became the most profitable firm in New Jersey as they continue to be today. But it was a firm built on those values of community service, pro bono, the law as a professional. You just didn't care about representing wealthy clients. That was not part of the culture. But when I started doing Criminal Justice Act work, I was doing Criminal Justice Act work to try cases. I was not--it was not, to be candid, it was not part of a pro bono approach. It was--
Speaker 1: You wanted to learn how to try (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I wanted to learn how to try cases. And they let me do it because they were happy I was there. And I was the hardest working associate in the firm, and I, I worked so hard, I just worked around it. The only time it would create tension is you get in, get in, sometimes in a big case, and you might be gone for a few weeks, and somebody would have to, you know, take up the slack. But they were always very accommodating. But that's how I really learned to try cases on my own. So I'm really on like a two track learning curve. I'm trying cases with Matt. I'm Matt's right hand person, and I'm--and they're letting me do Criminal Justice Act cases, of which there were a lot of cases I could try.
Story_ID: 542798
Speaker 1: Now, how did the, the, the Harold--
Speaker 2: Ruvoldt [Harold J. Ruvoldt, Jr.] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) Ruvoldt, how did that come to you 'cause I read that it was--there were scheduling conflicts. But can you tell the story behind--
Speaker 2: Well, the Ruvoldt, the Ruvoldt--
Speaker 1: 'Cause this is just--you're only a year into the firm [Lowenstein, Sandler, Brochin, Kohl, Fisher and Boylan; Lowenstein Sandler LLP] at this point, I think--
Speaker 2: Nah, maybe--
Speaker 1: A year and a half?
Speaker 2: When did I do it? In '83 [1983]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, '83 [1983].
Speaker 2: I did Ruvoldt in '83 [1983].
Speaker 1: Eighty-three [1983], but you--
Speaker 2: So I joined the firm in '78 [1978].
Speaker 1: Oh, wait a minute. I'm sorry, you became partner.
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's right.
Speaker 2: But I, but when I started I wasn't (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Okay, that's right, that's right.
Speaker 2: Ruvoldt is my--Ruvoldt is the case--
Speaker 1: Sorry.
Speaker 2: Ruvoldt is my first big trial. By the time I do Ruvoldt, I've been at the firm, say four, four years or five years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: From '78 [1978], and by that time, I have developed a statewide reputation, really, as a law guy, not a trial person, but as a law guy. And I'm actually, people are coming to me independently for me to do their appeals. And I'm Matt's [Matthew P. Boylan] appeal--I'm not only Matt's law guy, I'm picking up work from other lawyers, all right, I mean to do appellate work. So I started out really as an appellate lawyer. And--
Speaker 1: And that's really based on your research skills--
Speaker 2: Research, right, right.
Speaker 1: --and being able to--right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and Ruvoldt is my first huge trial case by myself that really puts me on the map as a trial lawyer. And Harold Ruvoldt was, at the time he was indicted, was the Hudson County [New Jersey] prosecutor. So he's the head, head prosecutor of Hudson County which is where Jersey City [New Jersey] is located. And Ruvoldt, at that time, was already a very famous lawyer, irrespective of his having become the prosecutor. At the age of twenty-nine, Ruvoldt had challenged how New Jersey financed its public school system. And in a case called Robinson v. Cahill [Robinson v. Cahill, 1973], he got the New Jersey Supreme Court to rule that the state system was unconstitutional, and that's how New Jersey came to have its income tax (laughter), really because of the Robinson v. Cahill case. So Ruvoldt was very famous. His father [Harold J. Ruvoldt, Sr.] had formerly been the president of the state bar. It was a famous family in New Jersey in the legal community. And Ruvoldt was charged with being involved in a bribery scheme right before he became the Hudson County prosecutor, doing some real estate work to build a big--that big shopping mall you now see when you go to the Holland Tunnel, Newport mall [Newport Centre, Jersey City, New Jersey]. It hadn't been built then. Apparently, there were payoffs. And he was indicted, and he hired Matt Boylan to try the case, and it was a huge case, front page of the paper case in New Jersey. And a guy named Hunt Dumont [W. Hunt Dumont] was the U.S. attorney at that time, and Hunt Dumont decided he was going to personally try the case. That's, that's how high a profile it had. And there were rumors in the paper, you know, to the effect that Dumont wanted to run for governor, and that he was gonna use the Ruvoldt case as his stepping stone to run for governor. Dumont was like Ruvoldt, from a very famous family. His father [Wayne Dumont, Jr.] was a state senator.
Story_ID: 542799
Speaker 1: And Ruvoldt [Harold J. Ruvoldt, Jr.] hires Matt [Matthew P. Boylan], and they got in an argument. And we wanted--Ruvoldt and I wanted to make a motion against the U.S. attorney's office and allege that there was prosecutorial misconduct and that there was a conflict and that this indictment was driven in part because Ruvoldt had not cooperated with the U.S. attorney's office in a particular investigation, and that that had colored their assessment of the facts. And although motions alleging prosecutorial misconduct are fairly common now, back in the early '80s [1980s], they were not. This is, you know, I mean white collar criminal work is kind of developing in the '70s [1970s]. It's really picking up, and you're getting better lawyers in the game, being more creative, being more aggressive. But this type of motion against the government was not that common. And Matt, who was a former assistant U.S. attorney, and what I'll call from the old school, thought it was inappropriate for us to challenge the actions of the prosecution as having influenced the judgment in the case. And we went out to try to settle--we had, and we had a pretty big fight 'cause Harold and I thought we were right, and Matt said, "I'm not gonna do it. I won't be part of it." We went out. And we got a guy named Henry Ruth [Henry S. Ruth]. And Henry Ruth was one of Matt's closest friends when he had been at the [U.S.] Department of Justice. And Henry Ruth was the first Watergate prosecutor, the lead trial prosecutor in Watergate. Leon Jaworski was the special prosecutor and Ruth was his trial guy. And Ruth was renowned nationally in the justice department. And Henry and Matt were, you know, close friends, and Henry had just left Justice a few years earlier to go into private practice. And Matt said, "Well, let's talk to Henry." And I knew they were close, and Henry came up. And we had a meeting, and Henry thought I was right, that we should make the motion. And Matt said, "I still--I don't care what you say, I'm not gonna do it." And Harold said, "Well, okay, then you're off the case, and I understand, but I'm going with Ted [HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.]. And I'm gonna let Ted try the case." And I made the motion. We lost the motion, but that's how I got, that's how I went from being the number two in the case to being number one. And nobody thought I could win the case, and I tried the case and got an acquittal in a case that, you know, again, nobody thought I could win. And that really put me on the map in New Jersey. And it was, this is truly front page of the Newark [New Jersey] or New Jersey papers every day, New Jersey nightly news, lead story.
Story_ID: 542800
Speaker 1: But what happened there, Ruvoldt [Harold J. Ruvoldt, Jr.] which put me on the frontline of New Jersey trial lawyers led to the Donovan case, which put me really on the--at the top nationally because what happened, right after Ruvoldt, Ray Donovan [Raymond J. Donovan], who was from New Jersey, had become the secretary of labor for President Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan]. And there were allegations that Secretary Donavan was involved with organized crime. They had a special prosecutor, Leon Silverman, one of the early special prosecutors, first appointments, really, after Watergate, appointed to investigate Donovan. Silverman concluded he was not--there were any problems. And we thought--Donovan thought the whole thing was over. But Mario Merola who was the district attorney here in the Bronx [New York], got a hold of some tapes, and--from the federal investigation. And he thought Donovan had broken the law in connection with construction of a huge subway system in New York [New York], based on what he heard on the tapes. And he indicted Donovan, Donovan's company, Schiavone Construction Company [Schiavone Construction Co. LLC], and eight other executives. And at the time of the indictment, I was coming off Ruvoldt, and because they were all Jersey based, I don't know what the discussion was, but somebody said, well, let's give--let's get the guy that just got Ruvoldt off and let him, and let him lead the defense. So I represented, I technically represented the president of the company who was Joe DeCarolis [Joseph DeCarolis]. Donovan was chairman of the board, and most of the evidence was against Joe. But I led the defense, and--for everybody. So I was lead counsel in that case, which we tried for nine months in the Bronx. At the end of nine months of trial, we did not--we put on no witnesses, and the jury acquitted Donovan and everybody else and that really put me on the map nationally. I mean that--I showed you one of those newspaper articles where, after I cross examined the expert, Donovan went out and bought this big bunny rabbit on the street. It said, I love you, and I still have it downstairs in my office in a corner. I mean this huge rabbit. It was around Easter when I did the cross. And, and I'll never forget, we walked, and he saw, he saw them. They were selling these bunny rabbits on the corner, and he ran and he bought it, and he came back and he gave me the rabbit (laughter) and said, "I love you," 'cause that cross examination was one of the turning points in the case.
Story_ID: 542801
Speaker 1: Let's go back to Ruvoldt [Harold J. Ruvoldt, Jr.] though. How long did that case last?
Speaker 2: About a month.
Speaker 1: A month, okay.
Speaker 2: That's my thinking.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what did you learn about witness preparation? Did you learn anything in that case about witness preparation (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't think I learned anything new. I'd been trying cases with Matt [Matthew P. Boylan] before that, had really learned--I mean I knew how to, you know--I knew how to try a case. By then, by the time I tried Ruvoldt, I was on the--I was actually on the teaching circuit. I was teaching stuff with Herb Stern [Herbert J. Stern] who was the Ruvoldt judge. We were--I was actually teaching with Stern who was one of the most prolific teachers of trial practice in the country. And I was part of his team. I was teaching the basic trial course for the PLI [Practising Law Institute]. And--
Speaker 1: Now, were you still at Seton [Seton Hall University School of Law, Newark, New Jersey] at that point?
Speaker 2: No, no, I just taught (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, you had already--
Speaker 2: --no, I taught Seton--
Speaker 1: --at the very beginning.
Speaker 2: --I taught Seton at the beginning and found it was--my schedule was too much. And I couldn't, and I could not handle teaching and doing Criminal Justice Act [Criminal Justice Act of 1964] and doing my work at Lowenstein [Lowenstein, Sandler, Brochin, Kohl, Fisher and Boylan; Lowenstein Sandler LLP]. It was, 'cause doing Criminal Justice Act work and Lowenstein, it was like two jobs. But I was also very active--I'd also gotten very active--I'm taking you down another road in political--
Speaker 1: With the NA- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, no, at that point, in political affairs and affairs within the Garden State Bar [Garden State Bar Association], which is the New Jersey black bar association. So, I mean probably--within my second year at the firm, we ran for [U.S.] Congress. We took, we ran--Peter Rodino [Peter W. Rodino]--we're going down another road, but Peter Rodino was the congressman from New Jersey, who had become nationally famous because of what he did--he was the lead person on the House [U.S. House of Representatives] side in Watergate. And he had been New Jersey's congressman from Newark [New Jersey] for, you know, twenty years. But what happened, Newark, over time, went from being a predominantly Italian city to a predominantly African American city. And Rodino didn't want to step down, and people thought it was time for New Jersey to have a black congressperson 'cause we had none. And this is, you know, things are little different now, but back then, there were very few black congressmen in the Congress at all. And people thought Jersey, certainly, with its population in Newark, should have a black congressman. And so I'd already gotten involved in political campaigns. And I mean, I'm truly one of the Young Turks in town. And we, so first we ran Golden Johnson [Golden E. Johnson], who was a young black woman. We lost, but we learned, we learned how to run a campaign. And then Donald Payne [Donald M. Payne], after Golden's campaign, asked me would I be his finance chair 'cause Donald was a Newark freeholder at that point.
Speaker 1: Okay, what year are we?
Speaker 2: We're in the early--we're in the late--early--late '70s [1970s] or early '80s [1980s] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Early '80s [1980s]?
Speaker 2: I mean I'd have to see. I mean Donald's been congressman now twenty years. I mean some of the Young Turks will eventually, gonna have to take him out like we did Rodino. But we ran--I'll never forget. We met in East Orange [New Jersey], over on Prospect Ave [sic. Prospect Street] in an apartment house. And we said, well, okay, we're gonna form the campaign. I was the finance chair, and everybody committed to raising so much money. And we ran the first time. We lost. We got about 30 percent of the vote. But 30 percent were real numbers, and I think one thing we did, we, we made it clear, Donald was the heir apparent. Then Rodino said he was gonna step down, and then he didn't step down. So we ran the second time. The second time, Jesse [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] came in and helped us, Jesse Jackson. And the campaign got real, real nasty on the racial side because Rodino had a lot of friends, and, you know, like he had, he had Teddy Kennedy [Edward M. Kennedy], he had Charlie Rangel [HistoryMaker Charles B. Rangel] with him, and we had Jesse. And they were saying the guy, Rodino had seniority, and you shouldn't take out the guy that has seniority and has a good voting record. And we were--we wanted, we wanted a black congressman, and we thought it was important to have a black congressman. We had no black (laughter) congressman from New Jersey, and we thought, regardless of voting records, it was important that, that Newark be represented by a black person. And, you know, so there were all sorts of allegations, you know, people were being racists and what have you. So the second time Donald ran, I guess he got, maybe 45 percent. We were close. We didn't win, but we were close and the handwriting was on the wall. And then Rodino, the third time he ran, Rodino stepped down, and by that time, this was our third time. We had a machine, and we knew how to do it.
Story_ID: 542802
Speaker 1: I mean, 'cause the, you know, the stories with Cory [Cory Booker], I mean what always outraged me with Cory is that they ran--when they ran against Cory, they ran an anti-education campaign. They basically criticized him because he had gone to Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California] and was a Rhodes scholar. And they made it like, you know, well, how the hell could you represent us, and the first guy he ran against was a friend of mine, Ralph Branch [Ralph M. Branch, Jr.], again, I know you--Branch, Branch, who had no college education came up with the saying, "He's a, he's a Rhodes scholar, I'm a road scholar. I've been, I've been--you need, yeah, you need somebody who's been on the road." (Laughter) But this was the kind of, you know, so you know what I mean. I mean it was ug- I mean it was ugly, you know. I mean, and, but so anyway, so they had elections yesterday, Tuesday, for some of the state senate [New Jersey State Senate] people. And Don's [Donald M. Payne], Don's--what's the guy? Craig [Craig A. Stanley] something, the guy from Irvington [New Jersey] who's Don Payne's nephew, he lost to Cory's guy. And I think--they're still counting some of the votes. I haven't seen the, I haven't see the Jersey [New Jersey] paper today. But, so some of this is in--you know, we're in real time with some of this is in play. And Don's brother, Bill [William D. Payne], who's the state senate- the state assemblyman, he wanted to run for [U.S.] Senate, and Cory is trying to take him out. And it looks, and it looks like he may. So it's, but again, 'cause I'm friends with the Paynes, I'm friends with Cory. I'm trying to, you know, stay low. Let me go, I'm going to Washington [D.C.] to do Libby [United States v. Libby, 2007], you know, you know, know, I'm going (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, wait, wait, wait, he's escaping (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's rights, you know. Yeah, I would help you, but I'm out of town.
Speaker 2: No, but even escaping to Washington with Libby, you wouldn't usually think that (laughter)--
Speaker 1: You know, hey, I'm busy, man. But some of this stuff is--yeah, I'm fortunate, I don't care anymore, but when you were young, you didn't know what you might want or what you might want to do so, you know, you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Story_ID: 542803
Speaker 1: 'Cause one thing we should talk about is Bradley and me because in this same period (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, when--but I didn't understand when Bradley came into your sphere. That's what I didn't understand.
Speaker 1: Okay, well I can tell you, Bradley comes into my sphere in '79 [1979].
Speaker 2: Seventy-nine [1979].
Speaker 1: Well, he runs in '78 [1978]. So Bradley, Bradley becomes a U.S. senator in '78 [1978]. And I don't know Bradley from Adam, but one of my friends--
Speaker 2: So it's a year after you joined Lowenstein [Lowenstein, Sandler, Brochin, Kohl, Fisher and Boylan; Lowenstein Sandler LLP]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 2: Okay, I got that--okay.
Speaker 1: So he, and he offers me the job to come to D.C. [Washington, D.C.]--he had five spots, okay. So Bradley's like the hottest thing in the world at this point. He's like the Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama], okay, of U.S. Okay, he's off the Knicks [New York Knicks], you know, he's got his rings, Rhodes scholar, Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey], college player of the year, and he becomes U.S. senator. So he got everybody in the world--are we on tape?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. So everybody in the world, you know, wants to work for Bill Bradley. And a guy named [HistoryMaker] Peter Bynoe, who is one of my close friend, knew Bradley from Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]. And I'm not sure how they met, but they were, they were close. And Bynoe talks to Bradley and says, "You know, you should try and hire Ted Wells [HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.], who's in New Jersey on your staff. And that's, you know, you should see if Ted will go to Washington with you." And Bradley calls me up, and we meet. And he says, "I wanna meet you. Bynoe says I should hire you. And I want to get to know you." And we met. I forget where we met. And we talked. And he said, "I'd really like you to come--think about coming to Washington with me." And I told him I'd never thought about going to Washington, gave my story to the effect of my wife [HistoryMaker Nina M. Wells] and I didn't wanna go back to Washington and that I never saw myself being on anybody's political staff, that I was trying to learn to be a trial lawyer. He said, "No, come on." So I remember I went to D.C., and I met with Marcia Aronoff and Ray Bramucci who were his top two people. And they said, "Look, this is only going to be five of us. We want you to come on board." And, and it was a very tough decision 'cause Bradley was truly the golden boy at that point in time, and this is--we're talking about a few months after the election. So I guess it's '78 [1978], '79 [1979]. And my wife and I talked about it. I talked about it with Matt [Matthew P. Boylan]. Matt's view was, if you wanna be a trial lawyer, you've gotta learn now. And I talked to Alan Lowenstein [Alan V. Lowenstein] and they said, "Look, it's just a different career path. You have to decide what you think is best for you," and at that point in time, I was enjoying myself and I just didn't see myself on somebody's staff, nor did I wanna tie myself to one person before I learned my own skills. You know, I was always a--I've always been very independent minded, and I don't--I trust me and trust my destiny to me. And the notion of going off script at that early an age, just didn't feel right. So I told him no, but I think Bill and he, well, he said, you know, many times. He was so shocked that somebody would tell him no, that we became friends. I became part of his circle, and I really learned how to raise money starting with Bill 'cause I think my first fundraiser probably was for Bill Bradley, and, and we became close.
Story_ID: 542804
Speaker 1: I mean he ultimately offered me U.S. attorney--I mean this is when Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] got in, he offered me to be U.S. attorney of New Jersey. He offered me two federal judgeships. I turned them all down because I wasn't interested in those jobs, and I was his national treasurer when he ran for president and had Bradley [Bill Bradley] been elected, you know, I probably would have had a good shot at being either the attorney general or going on the U.S. Supreme Court. He didn't win, but, you know, I don't regret it. My guy took the, you know, we took the shot, and, you know, the real problem when I look at it in hindsight is we waited too long. We, we just--he waited too long--the glow had gone off, people forgot who Bradley was for his, you know, or his career--affiliation with the Knicks [New York Knicks] and Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey] and being All-American, you know, and that's why I think Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] is making the right move. If you go, you know, take your shot while you're hot, and 'cause Bradley took the other course of saying, well, I'll try to--I won't run until I've been a senator for x number of years, but by the time he finally decided to run, he looked up and a lot of his supporters had gone off and done other things. And the young people didn't even remember who Bradley was.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So I think he, I think he waited too long.
Speaker 2: You're talking about his run for president, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, no, no, he ran, he ran for the [U.S.] Senate right after--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --in other words, if you think about what he did, it was kind of just the opposite. Right after he stopped being a Knick, he came to Jersey and he ran for the Senate with no experiences, not like Bill started running, you know, at the bottom and worked his way up. He, in hindsight, you know, maybe, you know, he should have run earlier, but the bottom line, he, you know, he didn't. And, you know, but we took our shot. It was a great campaign. We raised the money, and, but I just think, you know, he and Gore [Al Gore] were too close in terms of platforms. And you had one guy who had been the vice president for eight years, and you had Bradley, who had been a U.S. senator and had the--we had just as much money as Gore, but the question is well, why should the party turn from Gore and go to Bradley? And in hindsight, 'cause Bradley, Bill was offered the vice presidency before Gore. I mean when Clinton got the nomination, he came to Bradley first, remember, at Clinton--and Bradley actually gave the keynote speech at the party. And Bill was offering it, but Ernestine [Ernestine Misslbeck Schlant], his wife, had finished going through her cancer. She had breast cancer and she'd just had the mastectomy. And for whatever reason, he decided to turn down the offer of the vice presidency and Gore took it, so. But, you know, it was, it was a fascinating run.
Story_ID: 542805
Speaker 1: Now, I wanna go back to Lowenstein [Lowenstein, Sandler, Brochin, Kohl, Fisher and Boylan; Lowenstein Sandler LLP], and that--just even around that period of time, given what you've just said, why did you--I understood, you know, what being a criminal defense lawyer, why it resonated with you. But it seems to me, you know, and just what you just said, that it was a clear path for you very, very early on. So what did you see as a possibility? I mean what were you seeing your career was going to be except enjoying the fact that you liked winning, you know, or you liked--
Speaker 2: Well, that, that's--I--well, first--
Speaker 1: I mean 'cause you said, I turned this down, I turned that down, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I mean, well, like--look, I didn't have a specific job that I was looking for. Maybe being from D.C. [Washington, D.C.] where everybody worked for the government, government has never seemed to be an exciting place to me. I, I had--you know, my mother [Phyllis Wells] was, worked in the government for thirty-five years. So being in government was never, you know--it just wasn't. I just grew up, everybody I knew worked at the government. So going back to, you know, I just wasn't brought up that way. But, you know, as I told you earlier, I mean my, my first lawyer and early mentor and role model was Edward Bennett Williams. And Edward Bennett Williams was viewed as the best trial lawyer of his generation. He never went into government service in his life. But he was a player in public affairs, and I thought he lived a great life. And to the extent I thought about it, I usually did think about it along the lines of Edward Bennett Williams' life. And I believed I did not have to go into government service in order to take the next step. I mean I would tell people--when Brad- well, when Bradley [Bill Bradley] ran for president, people generally assumed if Bradley won, that I probably would be offered the attorney generalship or U.S. Supreme Court. And I used to tell people quite candidly, that they're probably right, and I probably could not turn down being the first black attorney general, nor could I turn down being on the U.S. Supreme Court. But at the same time, neither job really interested me, but I would have had to have done it as a matter of social obligation and community obligation. But to be honest, I don't, you know--when he, when Bradley did not get the nomination, and therefore, these opportunities did not present themselves, it's not like I went home and was upset because it's, you know, I play a role in the position I'm in right now in the--you know, it's not, I don't go to bed and never went to bed dreaming to be the attorney general or being on the Supreme Court. I mean, you know, I joke all the time, I'd be nice if I was on the Supreme Court to be a counter--you know, counterpoint to Clarence [Clarence Thomas], who despite our college, you know, friendship, you know, my political views are 180 degrees from. And I wish there were an African American justice who could serve as a counterpoint to Clarence's views. But that's a very monastic job. I mean I've visited Clarence there in chambers, and, you know, being a Supreme Court justice, it's, that's a lonely job. I clerked, I was, you know, I was an appellate court clerk [for John J. Gibbons]. Being an appellate court judge is a lonely job. You know, if I was gonna be a judge, I'd rather be probably a federal district court judge because at least, I think that's where the action is. But even then, I mean what a federal district court judge does at the end of the day, you're the umpire in the game. And I enjoy being in the game. Edward Bennett Williams always said that trial work was contest living. And that's a phrase that's always stuck with me, contest living. And it's true, and I love being involved in the contest, and sometimes, you know, there're big highs and there're big lows. But if you're gonna, if you like playing the game and this game of the law and doing trial work, it's a, it's a great way to live a life.
Story_ID: 542806
Speaker 1: I was gonna ask you about that, the loneliness 'cause I've had several friends who are--you know, and they talk about it being very lonely, very lonely, 'cause you can't do so many--you can't talk to people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I mean, I mean even if you're on the federal district court judge, I mean you can't, you know, you know, you talk to other judges. And if you've ever been a clerk, you see those judges don't even talk that much. And you, you know, it is--it's an isolating judge. I mean when I got offered, the first time Bradley [Bill Bradley] offered me to go on the federal bench, I went and I met with Bob Carter [HistoryMaker Robert L. Carter], Judge Carter in the Southern District [U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York]. And Carter's also been a mentor and a, and a close friend. And I asked him what did he think? And Carter told me, he said, turn it down. And he said, because what he said, and I, and I agreed with him, he said you've had the opportunity to go to areas of the law that no black lawyer has been able to go to, that has been able to crack some of these barriers. He said there are a lot of black lawyers out there who can take that judgeship, but I'm not sure who's gonna step into your place in terms of the role you have been able to play and the places you've been able to get to. He said, I know there are other people who can take that--can take the bench and play that role. So unless, he said, unless you've got a burning desire just to be do it 'cause that's what you wanna do, he said, in terms of African Americans and kind of allocating our limited resources and where do we need you, he said, you're better off continuing to play the role and occupying the space that you occupy than being on the bench. And I, and I believed that, you know.
Speaker 1: And he was right about that. (Cough) He was right about that.
Story_ID: 542807
Speaker 1: I wanna go back to one other thing I read about the Rum- Ru--
Speaker 2: Ruvoldt [Harold J. Ruvoldt, Jr.].
Speaker 1: --Ruvoldt case, and it was really your style in dealing with the judge, you know, and I was, you know, 'cause the judge was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The judge was mean.
Speaker 1: He was (laughter) mean.
Speaker 2: I gotta say. He was just at my house the other day so I have to--
Speaker 1: Well, I'm sure you impressed him, but anyway--
Speaker 2: I knew him, I was teaching with him.
Speaker 1: You were teaching with him (laughter), right.
Speaker 2: He was teaching, but--
Speaker 1: But so, that's, okay, that's right. That's where--okay, you were teaching with him and appearing before him, okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, I'd been in the, I'd been in the Dickens [Al Dickens] case. Stern [Herbert J. Stern] was the judge in the New World of Islam case. I was teaching with Judge Stern. Judge Stern had tried to get me to leave Lowenstein [Lowenstein, Sandler, Brochin, Kohl, Fisher and Boylan; Lowenstein Sandler LLP] and go to the U.S. attorney's office in a senior position. I've--to this day, I have a--Judge Herb Stern is a friend of mine. I have a relationship with Herb Stern. He's a--and talk about small world, his daughter just graduated from Fordham law school [Fordham University School of Law, New York, New York] along with my son [Phillip Wells]. So my son and his daughter have become friends through law school. It's just kind of happenstance, but Judge Stern was just at my house for the graduation party two weeks ago.
Story_ID: 542808
Speaker 1: You were talking about how during this period, you know for--well, you were talking about, not just during this period, but even before you became partner [at Lowenstein, Sandler, Brochin, Kohl, Fisher and Boylan; Lowenstein Sandler LLP], that you became politically, you know, active. And that was forming another part of you. Mainly, you're getting, you're really learning New Jersey.
Speaker 2: I'm learning, I'm learning New Jersey. I mean I tell young lawyers all the time, it is--if you are a lawyer, it is so easy to become involved, if you want to, in the political process, because every politician needs volunteer lawyers to help him or her with election law issues, campaign spending issues. So I started off--the way I met the Paynes, either Donald [Donald M. Payne] or Bill [William D. Payne] were running for some office, and Alan Lowenstein [Alan V. Lowenstein] introduced me to the Paynes. And they asked me would I help 'em on, on, what do you call it? Polling, not polling, being a challenger at the polls. And I wrote a book, I wrote a brochure. I research New Jersey law and wrote a brochure on the rules dealing with how you did challenges. So if you were at the election booth, if you were at the election place, at the school that day, what are you permitted to do as a challenger? How do you make sure the rules are being followed? How many feet away from the machines do you have to be? So I wrote a pamphlet. Then I went out and lectured. So I taught the other people how to, how to do challenges. That's how I met the--started with, started with the Paynes. I mean I met them through Alan, but we started, not thinking about Donald ultimately being a congressperson, but actually my just using them to try to understand the political process. They needed young lawyers, and I, you know, I met a lot of people because I was willing to go and read the, read the book, which anybody could do, but you read the election law books, and started learning the law. So I mean, I mean ultimately I became the--I was general counsel to the Democratic Party in New Jersey at one point. But, you know, I mean when Christie Whitman [Christine Todd Whitman] was elected governor, and remember there was an allegation that Rollins [Ed Rollins] had paid off the black ministers. I mean I went into court to try to enjoin her, enjoin her election. I was not welcomed in the State House [New Jersey State House, Trenton, New Jersey] for the next eight years. I lost. I mean it was a--but it was a, you know, it fascinating. I've got a drawing downstairs 'cause Michael Chertoff, who's now the homeland security person [U.S. secretary of homeland security], he was the U.S. attorney, so he was in the middle of it in terms of whether the election had been proper. But I mean, I mean I tell young lawyers all the time, you know, if, if you wanna be involved in the process, you should do so and do so while you're young 'cause you kind of grow up with people. But I look back, I mean I--you know, I've challenged some elections. I mean I--we went in, I went in on behalf of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]. We challenged, even when Tom Kean [Thomas Kean] ran, we got an injunction because the Republican Party was engaged in what we thought were intimidating election efforts. They had, one year they were wearing black arm bands, and they looked like they were police. And they would be at the polls. And you think about it, I mean I remember learning how to be a challenger like a year into my legal career. And I remember ten years later, I'm actually in federal court dealing with that very issue on how the Republican Party--and some of this really, a national level, had been using tactics that we contended were designed to intimidate African Americans. I mean the injunction that we got, you know, still exists right now. It's a lot of injunctions in New Jersey, Dick Debevoise [Dickinson R. Debevoise] is a federal judge. You're seeing it now, but it's still, he's still policing it. It's alive right now.
Speaker 1: How long do injunctions--I didn't know they could--how long is, his injunction?
Speaker 2: Well, they keep, he keeps upping it 'cause they keep having problems, okay. These problems are in Jersey. You go back to Florida, I mean the Republican Party in New Jersey, you know, there's a long, documented history of using, intimidating folks. I can't--as I sit here, I haven't gone and read, is it alive right as we sit here, but I believe it is.
Story_ID: 542809
Speaker 1: Now, I wanna ask because we had sort of jumped over, your becoming partner. Now, what--was there any, was it clear that you were going to--
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: Okay, so you didn't have any drama behind the scenes that others go through (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I did not. I became a partner in--
Speaker 1: September--was it--
Speaker 2: --at four years or something, when--
Speaker 1: You became a--
Speaker 2: --is it '81 [1981]?
Speaker 1: You became a partner in '82 [1982].
Speaker 2: Eighty-two [1982], so I became--
Speaker 1: Isn't that unusual? That seems quick.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but they gave me--what they did, they gave me a year's credit for my M.B.A.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: And they gave me a year's credit for my clerkship. So, they treat it--okay, I took the position, well, you ought to look at me like a 1975 person. And, but I was--when I started at the firm [Lowenstein, Sandler, Brochin, Kohl, Fisher and Boylan; Lowenstein Sandler LLP], I made a conscious decision. I was gonna be the hardest working associate in the firm. I didn't know, I couldn't tell you--I couldn't tell you when I started off what my work quality would be like, but there was one thing I knew I could control, and that was pure hours, okay. And I started from day one, that there would be nobody who would work harder than me. And up until the day I left, I remained--there was one guy, another of my partners, Ben Kohl [Benedict M. Kohl], and there was always a question, who had the most hours? Me or Ben. And Ben, I never could beat Ben, but I was always second, and I'm talking about within the partnership. But I mean when I was an associate there was nobody who worked longer hours than me. And I would work the longest hours, and I would still be involved in political stuff and other things. So there was to be, you know, I'm trying to be modest and humble, but there was just--in terms of my partnership, there was, there was no question I was gonna be a partner. They were more concerned would I go somewhere else. That was, that was not--the issue wasn't would I become a partner? The issue was, would they keep me because by that time, I'd figured out, and I didn't know, nor today, not only did I work long hours, whatever it took to be--whatever combination of skills it took to be a really excellent lawyer, that things seemed to be coming together for me. And I had the ability at an early age to kind of take race out of the equation. I mean I was--it just wasn't, it just wasn't an issue. I mean I used to tell people I believe, as minority lawyers, you need, you need to learn how to get confidence, how to have, have people get confidence in you quickly 'cause I believe when you walk in the room, okay, you look different, you talk different, and it's gonna--and people are not used to it. But if you can turn that around quickly, that's what you need to do. You'll be fine. But I admit, I've walked into some rooms and, you're the lawyer they sent. And, but I had the ability or learned to develop the ability to take that out early on. But it's always there. I don't care, I don't care if you're a black male, if you're a woman, white or black, you walk in, it's not the same stereotypical comfort level that they have when the guy with white skin and gray hair walks in. It's just we--you know, it's part of the changing format. But, you know, I mean, I mean what you find in the law, the real battle is not what happens to the so called superstars. The real, the continuing battle is what happens to the black B plus lawyer versus the white B plus lawyer. The white B plus lawyer becomes a super partner. And the black B plus lawyer can't even become a partner, okay. Now, you get the people that, the A pluses--people who make excuse--in this day and age, you know, if you got so much pure talent, but that's not really where the war is. The superstars are not being hurt. In fact, everybody's fighting over the same two or three superstars. The real, the real battle is why does the African American B plus lawyer, in my opinion, get screwed and the white B plus lawyer goes off to, you know, and have some great career. And that's where the war is.
Story_ID: 542810
Speaker 1: Now, when you--so there was no issue about you becoming partner. Now, what, how many people--
Speaker 2: I mean I was a part- look, I became partner. It was no issue. Within two or three years, and the great thing about Lowenstein [Lowenstein, Sandler, Brochin, Kohl, Fisher and Boylan; Lowenstein Sandler LLP], it's not a, it's not a step system. I mean this is, Paul, Weiss [Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP], we have what's called a lockstep system. Lowenstein was not a system based on seniority. So probably I would say within five years of being a partner, I was probably the highest earner at Lowenstein, you know. I mean, but if I wanted to make money, I should have stayed in New Jersey 'cause I'd be much--Lowenstein was much more creative and, but--
Speaker 1: What system did they have then? You're saying it was a point system was it a point (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, no, yeah, yeah, but it's, it's not a question of points. It's a question of how much credit do you give to business generation. And then at Lowenstein I had a deal where I kept a significant amount of the premiums that I generated. And I'm a big premium person. I don't, I really don't believe that much in the hourly system. So I'm a, I am one of the more creative pricers in the business. And so, at Lowenstein, I might--so let's say, if I represented x and at the end of the, at the end of the representation, I said, I want a $5 million premium. That's the value on top of the hours. And the person gives me the $5 million. At Lowenstein, I keep a significant amount of that money. At Paul, Weiss, that money just goes into the pot. So it's a more entrepreneurial system, and in terms of just making money, I'm--an entrepreneurial type system would be far better for me. But again, there were a combination of factors that made me decide to come here. But, in terms of money, I would have, I probably could have stayed at Lowenstein and done better.
Speaker 1: Now, you were their first black partner, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 542811
Speaker 1: My name is Julieanna Richardson, and I'm the interviewer and Neculai Burghelea, who I always butcher his name is the videographer, and Adrienne Jones is the observer. And I wanna start out, because really you spoke a lot of litigation sort of being a contest, learning how to be a contest lawyer. You talked about that, you know, how you had come, by the time you had your first big case, you know, you'd been doing lots of, you know, cases in the criminal courts, and how that sort of formed you. Now, I, I'd like to go to--and let's, this is, you know, not correct, I'd like to maybe start politically again just a little bit, and I wanna put us at Donald Payne [Donald M. Payne], and you know, they--you helped them get elected. What were you doing politically around the time of the Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] campaign?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Is that going too far ahead (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) Clinton, well, the Clinton campaign was 19--
Speaker 1: Ninety-two [1992].
Speaker 2: Ninety--well, he was elected in November, November of '92 [1992].
Speaker 1: Ninety-two [1992], yes.
Speaker 2: And if you go back to the primary, there was a period when there was a lot of pressure on Bill Bradley to jump into the race. Bill did not run for the nomination in '92 [1992] but because Clinton was having problems in New Hampshire, based on the Gennifer Flowers situation, a lot of people in the party were calling for Bill to step up and run. Bill made the decision not to run. It turned out probably to be the right decision because his wife, Ernestine [Ernestine Misslbeck Schlant], contracted breast cancer (background noise) and Bill, as people may remember--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Your phone needs to be totally off because it interferes with the mic [microphone].
Speaker 2: You could hear that?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Hear what?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): The phone.
Speaker 2: The phone's doing something?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Yeah, it's either--
Speaker 2: It's on vibrate.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Maybe both, maybe both, but I can hear--
Speaker 2: I'll be happy to turn it off.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Yeah.
Speaker 2: And as you may remember actually, when Clinton did get the nomination, he asked Bill Bradley to give the keynote address which was at Madison Square Garden [New York, New York]. I was there as Bradley's guest. And then Clinton ran, I mean in the primary, I'm trying to remember what I was? Was I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Ted [HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.], Ted, can I ask you--
Speaker 2: --I may have ran lawyers for Clinton in New Jersey. I was on the, I was on the DNC. I was on the Democratic National Committee. I was on the finance committee, nationally. I mean I was very much involved in raising money in New Jersey for the Clinton run.
Speaker 1: But can I ask a question? From the time that you met, you know, Bill Bradley and he offered you the position--
Speaker 2: To work on his staff.
Speaker 1: --to work on his staff, and, you know, and the ensuing years, what did your relationship become during that period of time?
Speaker 2: With Bradley?
Speaker 1: Yeah, with Bradley.
Speaker 2: Oh, from the time Bradley and I met, we became--we, we hit it off. We became friends. I think Bill was always fascinated that he had offered me one of the limited five jobs he had on his staff in Washington [D.C.], to be one of his key staff members, and I was turned him down when he was probably getting ten thousand resumes. You know, he never could figure out why this kid was turning him down when everybody else was begging to work for him. And we stayed in touch on a regular basis after that, and I became one of his chief fundraisers in New Jersey and one of his closest friends and advisors. That's how the relationship started. And it continued over the years. And at the same time, I was Bill's, one of Bill's top finance people. I continue to be the finance chairperson for Congressman Payne. I was his first--I was Congressman Payne's first finance chair, and continue to be his finance chair today.
Story_ID: 542812
Speaker 1: During this time, you're active on all different levels, really, within--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --you know, within New Jersey. I mean, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right, within New Jersey, and at the same time when Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] ran, I became active nationally 'cause I think that's when they put me on the Democratic National Committee. I was on the finance committee for Clinton, started dealing with Rahm Emanuel who was the point person, Clay--the person who ran finance in New Jersey is a guy named Clay Constantinou who became ambassador to Greece [sic. Luxembourg] under Clinton. And Clay was very active. New Jersey and New York are the two biggest states for--and California, for financial fundraising. If somebody runs for president or any national office, they want New York and New Jersey. You look at the--the richest states per capita in the country every year, New Jersey and Connecticut flip flop. That's where, I mean New Jersey is a prize for, in terms of people who raise money financially.
Speaker 1: Now, in this, in the time that you came, you know, first moved to New Jersey to the time, you know, the time, you know, around the Clinton years, what politically--had it changed because you had talked about it being a Republican stronghold, you know. I'm just wondering did it--it still has on the state level--
Speaker 2: No, no, no, New Jersey is firmly in the Democrat camp now. And I'm not sure--
Speaker 1: Do you remember how that--
Speaker 2: --if I said it was a Republican stronghold, when I got to the state, I mean it kind of, you know, it kind of--New Jersey's always been a swing state. That's a better way to look at it. And we've gone through periods because when I first came to the state, it's probably, Case [Clifford P. Case] might have still been the U.S. senator, and then he stepped down, and that's when Bradley [Bill Bradley] ran. I came to New Jersey in '76 [1976]. Bradley ran in '77 [1977] and won in '78 [1978]. That's when he was elected. So what you saw was a transition. But I went through both the Florio [James Florio] years when we had a Democratic governor. When I first came, I guess, maybe Brendan Byrne was probably still the governor. We went through the Tom Kean [Thomas Kean] years as governor, Christie Whitman [Christine Todd Whitman] years, both of which were very close elections. I mean I was, I ultimately became the general counsel to the New Jersey Democratic Party when Christie Whitman was elected governor. There was allegation that Ed Rollins, one of her chief campaign people had paid off black ministers and I actually was, went into court and tried to enjoin her being sworn in as governor. It was ultimately unsuccessful, but the judge did give us the opportunity to take Rollins' deposition, and we, we pressed it for about a month, and they actually did hold it up for a period of time. That was, you know, front page 'cause nobody really had tried to hold up an election, but the election was very close, and she only won by--I forget the exact number, but it was very, it was a very close election.
Story_ID: 542813
Speaker 1: Let's look at the years then, you know, and I, this is the Clin- from Clinton's [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton], like 1992 to 1998. Those are the years I was sort of interested in.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And in terms of either your career at Lowenstein [Lowenstein, Sandler, Brochin, Kohl, Fisher and Boylan; Lowenstein Sandler LLP], what when you look back at that time period are sort of, you know, critical, because--
Speaker 2: Well, if you look at--if you take '92 [1992] forward, I mean one of the big things for me was whether or not I was gonna stay in private practice because as soon as Clinton was elected and the Democrats were now in control, Bradley [Bill Bradley] offered me two judgeships, offered me a--well, first--I guess the first thing he asked me if I wanted to be U.S. attorney for New Jersey. And at that time, Michael Chertoff who's now the secretary of homeland security, and a close friend of mine was the U.S. attorney in New Jersey. And it was a question of who would succeed Chertoff, and Bradley offered me the job. And I would have been the first African American U.S. attorney. They still have not had an African American U.S. attorney, even as I speak today. He offered me the job, and I was not interested in being a federal prosecutor. And I, in fact, thought the right thing to do was to let Chertoff finish out his term. And it was a lot of controversy going on in that time 'cause when Clinton first came in, he asked all the U.S. attorneys nationally to submit their resignations, and Bradley decided to let Chertoff stay another eighteen months. And then a woman by the name of Faith Hochberg [Faith S. Hochberg], who was my classmate at Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], succeeded him as the first female U.S. attorney in New Jersey. And then Bradley offered me federal district court judgeship or a position on the Third Circuit [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit], and I turned both of, both of those positions down.
Speaker 1: And you had spoken about how, you know, you had talked to Robert Carter [HistoryMaker Robert L. Carter].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Then I--and that he said, you know, a lot of people could have that.
Speaker 2: Could be the--could have the judgeships, and he thought I had been fortunate enough to really reach a unique position in the legal profession. And it was better if, you know, probably if I stayed where I was.
Speaker 1: And that's true.
Story_ID: 542814
Speaker 1: Let's go to 1998 with the, you know, Michael Espy case [United States v. Espy, 1998]--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --because I want to--had you known Espy beforehand, known of him or had any contact with him?
Speaker 2: I, I had not had any contact. Well, with him, what happened, to give you the background, when the investigation started of Mike Espy, they initially focused on his brother, Henry, and, who was at that time the mayor of Clarksdale, Mississippi and the president of the National Conference of Black Mayors. And Mike was from that part of the Delta. And they were focusing--there were multiple investigations. And one of the issues was whether or not Mike had gotten certain people to give money to Henry's campaign for [U.S.] Congress 'cause when Mike became the secretary of agriculture, his brother, Henry, tried to run for his seat, and there were questions whether unlawful contributions were made to the Henry Espy committee for Congress in return for certain legislation being pushed by Mike. It was--none of this was true, but that was the source of the investigation (cough) excuse me. They initially indicted two white businessmen from Montana, a guy named Gary Black [Gary A. Black] and another guy by the name of John Hemmingson, who were the chief operating officers and owners of a company called Crop Growers [Crop Growers Corporation], which sold crop insurance. I didn't know there was such a thing as crop insurance, until Gary Black in Montana hired me to represent him. And Gary was indicted in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], and I represented Gary, and that was really the first trial [United States v. Crop Growers Corp., 1997], first case to go to trial out of the multiple Espy investigation indictments. There were multiple indictments, not just of Mike. Mike didn't get indicted for over a year later. And I represented Gary Black, spent a lot of time in Montana, which I'd never been to. And I tried Gary's case in D.C., got an acquittal. And right after I got the acquittal and in the course of that, I spent a lot of time in Clarksdale with Henry Espy, Mike's brother, and got to know him pretty well, 'cause you needed to understand the background of what had happened in Mississippi with Henry's campaign and what have you. And then right after I got Gary off, in D.C., Mike came and said, I want you to represent me and asked me if I would be willing to work with his then existing lawyer, Reid Weingarten, who I had known for years. I said I'd be, wouldn't have any problem working with Reid. Reid is a close friend of mine, and that's how I came to, to represent Espy.
Story_ID: 542815
Speaker 1: So talk about the case [United States v. Espy, 1998]. I mean in terms of just sort of the context. I mean this is in--he was our, you know, he had been appointed our secretary of agriculture (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, well, Mike [Mike Espy] had been the congressman from Mississippi for the Delta area. He was, you know, an active member of the Congressional Black Caucus. He was already a national figure before he ever was appointed Clinton's [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] secretary of agriculture. When Clinton came in, he appointed Mike to be the first African American secretary of agriculture. It was a historic moment. And almost immediately the Republicans started investigating him, and one of the issues was whether or not he had taken what are called gratuities from various people who were trying to get legislation passed and other favors from the [U.S.] Department of Agriculture. And it was like six or seven cases wrapped up as one. There was, one part of the case involved Tyson Foods [Tyson Foods, Inc.], the big chicken, meat wholesaler down in Arkansas, whether Mike had taken tickets to Dallas Cowboys' games and had gone with Mr. Tyson [Donald Tyson] to some birthday parties where [HistoryMaker] B. B. King was playing and whether Mike got all this free travel and what have you. There were allegations that Mike, who was then divorced, whether his girlfriend had gotten scholarship monies. There was another piece of the case involving a big agricultural cooperative [Sun-Diamond Growers of California] out in California and whether Mike had received monies and various gifts from a guy named Richard Douglas who was one of the leaders of the California cooperative. There was a Quaker Oats [Quaker Oats Company] piece. As I said, it must have--it was like seven different cases all wrapped up into one. And the independent counsel, Donald Smaltz, who returned the indictment, he tried it personally. And we tried that case in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], I guess we started Labor Day. I don't know, was it '98 [1998], and we tried it for four months. Smaltz put on seventy witnesses. At the end of the seventy witnesses, we did not put one person on the stand. We rested and went right to summations. And after about four days of deliberations, Mike was acquitted on either forty-two or thirty-eight counts. It was a whole bunch of, a bunch of not guilties. But it was, it was a scary case because some of the statutes had a very low level of intent. There were also obstruction of justice charges. They said Mike had lied. It was a, it was--I had one of these memorable cross examinations of the government's main witness, a guy named Richard Douglas. And Richard had been the deputy secretary for the Department of Agriculture in the Republican administration, I guess under, I guess it was Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan]. And he, he pled guilty and cooperated against Mike, and I'll never forget, I had Douglas first admit that he was a repeated liar. And then I got Douglas to admit that he thought the prosecutor was a liar. And I said, "Well, let me get this straight. You're a liar, you think the prosecutor is a liar, and the two liars went into a conference room to cut a deal whereby you would give testimony against Mike Espy, is that right?" And the guy said, "Birds of a feather flock together" (laughter). And I thought the case was won at that point. Jurors started laughing. The prosecutor started putting his head down. It was one of those dramatic moments, almost like something on TV. But like I said, they put on seventy witnesses. And, you know, we had people like Leon Panetta, who was chief of staff to the president. We didn't put Gore [Al Gore] on, but there was a big piece involving Vice President Gore. We had the secretary of environmental affairs [sic. administrator of the environmental protection agency, Carol Browner]. We had half the Clinton cabinet testified. Then we had a great victory celebration the week later 'cause Mike Espy's portrait had not been hung at the Department of Agriculture. Usually, when you resign, your portrait is hung, but Mike really stepped down under pressure, and they had not hung his portrait. And they convened a ceremony a week after the acquittal at the White House [Washington, D.C.]. And you had most of the cabinet, about five or six hundred people in addition. And I'll never forget, President Clinton was the master of ceremonies, and he stood up, and he started off, he said, "If it wasn't for Ted Wells [HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.] and Reid Weingarten, we would not be here today." And the whole cabinet and all the six hundred people stood up and gave us a standing ovation. And it was very moving because my mother [Phyllis Wells] was there, and then the president went and took pictures of my mother, you know, my mother being a country girl from Virginia, and having worked thirty-five years in the mail room at the Navy department [U.S. Department of the Navy], to be standing there taking pictures with the president was a big deal for her. And since it was a big deal for her, it was a big deal for me. So it was an extraordinarily moving moment.
Story_ID: 542816
Speaker 1: Was it that testimony of that day that made you decide on the strategy of no witnesses? You have done, you had done that before with no, you know--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --not putting--
Speaker 2: I mean, I mean philos- look, there're different camps. Some people in the defense bar believe that in a white collar case, corporate executives or politicians, that jurors wanna hear from the defendant, and the defendant should take the stand. Other people are in a different camp, and that's where I put myself, that I don't believe I need to put my client on the stand to win a case. I start out with the presumption in every case that my client will not testify, that the real issue in an American criminal trial is whether or not the government has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. And I like to keep the focus on the government's case, and whether or not the government has met its burden of proof. I tell every jury they need to understand that, in America, a defendant is presumed innocent. A defendant does not have to prove his innocence, that there's no box on the verdict sheet that says innocent. The verdict sheet says guilt or not guilty. That's their only job. They are to presume that person is innocent. There's not to be any discussion in the deliberation room about whether he is innocent. The only question is, has the government proved guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. And I believe that once you put your client on the stand, all of the flaws of the government's case go to the side and the real focus is on your client. So you should only put your client on the stand if you feel that the government has overwhelmingly proved its case, and you have to rebut something. So absent a belief that I'm in terrible trouble, my general posture is not to put my client on the stand. That's not to say I do it in every case. I have put people on the stand, but in terms of my starting point, I always start with the assumption that I will not put my client on the stand. So when I did not put Espy [Mike Espy] on the stand, it was not that extraordinary from my perspective, but I will let you know, and Mike has talked about this publicly, Mike desperately wanted to testify [during United States v. Espy, 1998]. Mike's a lawyer. He's extraordinarily articulate. He wanted to testify. He thought he should testify. And I had to stand on the table and tell him that he didn't need to do it. There was no upside in it, only downside 'cause I thought we were ahead. And he ultimately took my advice. But at a personal level, he, he wanted to testify, and I had to grab him and shake him. And we've talked about this publicly and none of this is attorney client privilege or anything.
Story_ID: 542817
Speaker 1: Did that case remind you of any other case that you, you know, had been involved with? Was there--and I, I was wondering if there was any similarity, though it wasn't white collar crime, you know, between that and Milken case [United States v. Milken] at the time? Was there, no?
Speaker 2: No, well, I mean, well--the Milken clase- case was about hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars of alleged financial fraud. And where as the, the Espy case [United States v. Espy, 1998] really didn't involve money at all. It was more a politician and his reputation. In that sense, I think they were very different. I mean the Espy case, it--you know, was probably closer to some of the campaign finance cases I've tried where I represented, for example, Franklin Haney [Franklin L. Haney], who was Vice President Gore's [Al Gore] main fundraiser out of Tennessee, and the allegation there was whether or not Haney had engaged in violations of the campaign finance laws in connection with the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton]. So these are more politically driven cases, and in fact, the big issue there that I argued to the jury was that Haney was a scapegoat, and that the prosecution was really being brought because they had decided not to appoint an independent counsel to investigate Vice President Gore, and they needed to show they were tough and indict somebody so they indicted poor Mr. Haney, but he was, he was acquitted.
Speaker 1: And so, but first there was the Espy case, and then Espy was followed by Haney [United States v. Haney, 1999], right? Weren't they--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay, right.
Speaker 2: --well, well, yeah, I think that's--
Speaker 1: I think so.
Speaker 2: Nah, no--
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: --that's wrong.
Speaker 1: That's wrong? I thought--
Speaker 2: That's wrong 'cause I--well, I know I did--
Speaker 1: 'Cause I--
Speaker 2: I, I, no, I know that's wrong because I got the verdict in Espy in December of '98 [1998].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I then, I then moved to Florida for a year, and all of--I spent all of 1999 living in Miami [Florida] and trying two cases back to back for Calvin Grigsby, the investment banker out of San Francisco [California]. So I know I was in Miami in a hotel for an entire year. I'll never forget that, all of 1999, and then when I came back at the end of 1999, I got the verdict in the--the second verdict in the Grigsby case [United States v. Grigsby], sometime in October of '99 [1999]. And then I came back, and that's when I made the decision to leave my law firm [Lowenstein, Sandler, Brochin, Kohl, Fisher and Boylan; Lowenstein Sandler LLP]. And I started at Paul, Weiss [Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP] in January of 2000. So Haney, Haney had to be before 'cause I know Espy was followed by Grigsby--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and it was a pure year, 'cause I was--it was a year of hell living in that hotel for a year.
Story_ID: 542818
Speaker 1: In the case of Espy [United States v. Espy, 1998], you, I think I had read where you said that was a difficult case for you. But also Grigsby [United States v. Grigsby] was a difficult case for you.
Speaker 2: Well, Grigsby was two different cases. Grigsby, you know, poor Calvin [Calvin Grigsby] was indicted twice and for two different allegations. And in one of them, they had Calvin on videotape agreeing to pay money, and they wired up the hotel at the St. Francis [Westin St. Francis] in San Francisco [California], and they had Calvin meeting with a politician from Miami [Florida] in the San Francisco hotel, where if you looked at the tape just by itself, you would have thought Calvin was agreeing to pay a bribe. Now, what you saw in the tape was real, but we took the position which was the truth that Calvin was just play acting because what had happened, and this all came out during the trial. Again, none of this is attorney client privilege, we took--we showed that Calvin in the early '90s [1990s] had been doing investment banking work in Miami and some Miami politicians tried to shake him down. And Calvin had done the right thing and gone to the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] and reported that he was being shaken down. He had agreed to wear a wire with the FBI to try to catch the crooked politicians. He wore the wire. The FBI was not able to make the case, and word got out that Calvin had worn a wire, and he was blackballed and couldn't do any business in Miami. So when he came back years later and was approached this time by a politician who, in fact, unbeknownst to Calvin had been caught doing something wrong and was already working for the FBI, the politician was (laughter), Calvin didn't know that. And Calvin felt he had nowhere to go. He was between a rock and a hard place. The first time he had gone to the FBI and all that happened was he got blackballed so Calvin just kind of played along with the, what he thought was the crooked politician in order to try to close his deal, which was a very lucrative deal for the people of Dade County [Miami-Dade County, Florida]. And the jury accepted our explanation of what happened, and Calvin was acquitted in both cases, in fact. But there, as I said, there were two different cases. The first case involved the Port of Miami [Dante B. Fascell Port of Miami, Miami, Florida], and those big cranes you see when you go to South Beach [Miami Beach, Florida]. Calvin used to own all of those cranes, whether there were improprieties involved in the acquisition of the cranes and the leasing of the cranes to the city. And then the second case involved alleged payoffs involving Dade County and the raising of money for the municipality by way of what's called a swap, a very complicated financial deal. So we--two different cases, two different judges, two different juries. We tried them back to back and got acquittals in both.
Story_ID: 542819
Speaker 1: So Espy [United States v. Espy, 1998] led to Grigsby [United States v. Grigsby] led to Haney [United States v. Haney, 1999] is what you're saying, no?
Speaker 2: No, I was repre- I represented Haney before Espy [sic.].
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm sorry. That's right. Haney, Espy, Grigsby. That's what you're--Haney.
Speaker 2: Well, I know Haney was--well, actually, you know what? That's wrong.
Speaker 1: See. I thought I was right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You're right, and I'm wrong. Let me tell you what happened. And you're right. And you're absolutely right. I'll tell you exactly what happened. I did Espy in '98 [1998]--
Speaker 1: Haney in--
Speaker 2: I moved--no, I moved to, I moved to Miami [Florida] in January. We got the verdict in December. I moved to Miami in January. We did the first Grigsby trial, like January, February. The judge gave us the acquittal, and between, before the second trial started, the second Grigsby trial started, I was called by some people who told me in substance, Vice President Gore's [Al Gore] main fundraiser is ready to go to trial in a week, or maybe it was ten days. And they want you to come and try the case. And I remember I told them I'd just been on trial for months. I've got another trial that's ready to start. I cannot come to D.C. [Washington, D.C.] ten days from now and try Haney's case. And they said, "No, it's very important. We want you to come." And they persuaded me to come to D.C. And I moved to D.C. on a Wednesday. I had never met Haney. I'd been retained on the telephone, never met Haney, move into the hotel, come try the case. I met--and I moved to D.C. Wednesday. I think I met Haney Thursday. I picked the jury on Monday. I did all twenty-one witnesses by myself. And I got, it was a ten day trial, like they said, and I got an acquittal ten days later and moved right back to Miami. And you're right. That's right Haney was after Espy, it was in that--
Speaker 1: In that period.
Speaker 2: --that forty-five day, we had like a rest period before the, between the two trials. And, and I tried it, it was ten day trial, and I tried it, and I met him four days before the, before--the Wednesday or Thursday before the trial started that Monday.
Story_ID: 542820
Speaker 1: Ted [HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.], I wanna understand how your strategies, like--
Speaker 2: I didn't put Haney [Franklin L. Haney] on the stand either. I rest (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I know, but how did you--how do you assess whether you're gonna take something or not or do--were you at that point just taking hard cases, you know? I mean how do you assess that, and like even do you sit down typically and meet with the person and decide if you have a good feeling about it? I mean what do you determine?
Speaker 2: Well, all the, all the cases I take are hard. They don't--that's why they come to me. I don't, I don't get the easy cases. I'm very expensive, and no use spending the money that I cost if you've got an easy case. There's, oh, there's an old Edward Bennett Williams story where he was talking to somebody about the case, and Edward Bennett Williams supposedly said, "Well, this is a really tough case." And the guy said, "Yeah, I know. That's why I came to you." And, so all my cases are tough. But I don't, I've never decided to take a case or not take a case based on whether it was tough 'cause they're all tough. But I'll tell you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How do you, then what--
Speaker 2: I mean it's basically what my time commitment is. And, I mean very few cases I've turned down 'cause, for the case itself. Maybe there's a client I might have met and didn't think it was gonna be a pleasant experience, and I might have come up with some excuse not to take the case because we're--you know, the worst thing in the world is to be in a case, and you don't like your client. And, you know, I had a, the experience when I, in January of '04 [2004] when I represented the Niels Lauersen who was the foremost doctor in the country at that time dealing in in vitro fertilizations, and he was indicted for healthcare fraud in New York [New York]. And this was all reported in Time magazine. It was a big to do 'cause he was a very prominent doctor, and at that time, he was going with Denise Rich, here in New York. And people approached me and asked me would I represent Denise's girl--boyfriend. And I met Niels, and Niels had been born in Denmark or somewhere in Europe that had socialized medicine. And, you know, Niels' view was that everybody should be able to get the best medical treatment, including fertility treatment. And the allegation was that instead of doing, instead of reporting to the insurance companies that he was advanced fertility treatments, that he was, he would report that he was doing a D and C [dilation and curettage] or some other kind of standard gynecological procedure. And I tried that case [United States v. Lauersen]--it was a very, very controversial case. Niels was a controversial figure, very high profile here in New York 'cause the courtroom was packed with all these women who Niels had helped to have babies. And the first day of the trial, all the women brought the babies into the courtroom. And Judge Pauley [William H. Pauley III] got mad because the babies were crying. And so he banned, I think all children from the courtroom under seven. And then the women got mad, and they put together a babysitting schedule, and they had all the babies running around the courtroom for the next three weeks of the trial. But I tried that, got a hung jury. Then, and then Niels went out and gave an interview in New York Magazine and said some things I thought were inappropriate. And I quit, and I quit the case.
Speaker 1: What did he say?
Speaker 2: He just--I don't wanna say it on camera, but it's New York Magazine, and he just talked about, he just--I told him not to talk to anybody. And he said some very disparaging things, I felt, about the prosecutor and the prosecutor's office that I felt were inappropriate. And he had a right to say what he wanted in theory, but I had a right to have myself and my reputation associated with who I wanted it to be associated with. And I wasn't gonna really countenance that type of behavior from somebody who was my client, and I quit. Then he hired Gerry Shargel [Gerald Shargel], and a good friend of mine. And Gerry represented him on the second trial. He was convicted, and I think he got like fifty or sixty months. He just got out. He's back in the newspaper now, 'cause he's on probation and apparently, according to the papers, their arguments say he's not comporting with his terms of probation. So it's in the papers, he's back in the papers now as we speak.

Speaker 1: Now, you know, Ted [HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.], I know you have a high capacity, you know, for work. But I'm wondering, like do you give--have you given yourself breather times, you know, between cases 'cause remember you said, I went from here, you know, to--
Speaker 2: I, I really haven't, but, I do kind of go from case to case. I'm trying to catch my breath right now after Libby [United States v. Libby, 2007] because I mean if you look at the last, at the last thirty months, probably twenty, twenty months I've been hotels 'cause I did the tobacco RICO case [United States v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., 2006] in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] for a year, wasn't back that long before I did the McCall [Charles W. McCall] case in San Francisco [California]. I was on, I moved to San Francisco in August of last year and didn't get out of there 'til November, moved right to D.C. to do Libby. And so, you know, I'm trying to, I'm trying to get some rest, but it's hard.
Speaker 1: Now, I wanna ask about your decision to come to Paul, Weiss [Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP] because, you know, you spoke about how Lowenstein [Lowenstein, Sandler, Brochin, Kohl, Fisher and Boylan; Lowenstein Sandler LLP] was more entrepreneurial--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you thought, you know--so, and I did read something where you said, well, you had, you know, talked about, you know, New York [New York] law firms and whether they were ever gonna do the right thing.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, but, and I know that, is it Paul Lemon?
Speaker 2: Arthur Liman [Arthur L. Liman].
Speaker 1: Arthur, I'm sorry, who is sort of the star here, you know. Had, had he passed by then?
Speaker 2: He, Arthur died--Arthur and I first met in either the late '80s [1980s] or '90s [1990s], whenever the Wall Street cases were. And he was representing Michael Milken, and what happened, Milken originally hired Edward Bennett Williams. Williams contracted cancer. Arthur was his co-counsel. The thought always was that Williams was gonna be the lead trial lawyer. And then Williams got sick and passed. And Arthur took over, and then the family, Michael's family watched me try the Princeton/Newport case [United States v. Regan, 1989]. And they told Arthur he should think about hiring me as his co-counsel. And then Arthur hired me and that's how we really met and started working together. And for years, Paul, Weiss, and a lot of New York firms, they tried to hire me. And I wasn't ready to come to New York. I was very happy in New Jersey. I developed a national practice. I didn't think there was any need to come to New York. And then after Arthur died, Paul, Weiss approached me again and said, we have a different type of offer this time. We'd like you to come over and head our litigation department. And it wasn't just an offer to be a partner. It was an opportunity to come in at the very highest level of the firm, one of the top few partners in the practice and run the litigation department. And I'll be honest, I was still gonna turn that down. I was happy in New Jersey, and one of my partners had a great saying. He said, "Why do you need a city when you have a state?" And Lowenstein, Sandler even offered to change the name to Lowenstein, Sandler and Wells, and I--look, I love my, you know, I still, I'm very close with Lowenstein, Sandler. And it was a very gut wrenching experience for me to leave, but my wife [HistoryMaker Nina M. Wells] kind of pushed it over the goal line because she said to me that, rightfully so, I had been on the national circuit for years, criticizing these major New York law firms for not having black partners, not having black folk in positions of power and influence. And here, one of the great litigation firms in the country was saying, we want you to be our premier trial lawyer and run our litigation department. And my wife said, "How can you turn that down?" And she viewed it really as a civil rights type moment. And she was right, she was right because it was important, I think in terms of breaking the stereotype. It was a bigger stage for me, but more importantly, it was, it was a bigger stage for black lawyers. And I think people think sometimes you came to--you know, you come to New York to make more money. I probably would make--would have made more money staying in Jersey because my firm in Jersey permitted me to have bigger cuts of certain cases, whereas, at a big, New York firm, everything goes into the same pot. So it wasn't--it really wasn't financially driven, but it was the right thing to do.
Story_ID: 542822
Speaker 1: Let me ask, the size of the litigation practice at Lowenstein [Lowenstein, Sandler, Brochin, Kohl, Fisher and Boylan; Lowenstein Sandler LLP] versus here. I just wanna have some--
Speaker 2: Well, well, I mean Lowenstein right now, I can't--Lowenstein is two hundred lawyers. Paul, Weiss [Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP] is six hundred. Lowenstein is not a small firm. But Lowenstein would be described as a region--a large, regional law firm, okay. It's one of the best firms in New Jersey, but it's a regional law firm. Paul, Weiss is an international law firm. We've got offices in London [England] and Beijing [China] and all over the world. And it is a different stage.
Speaker 1: So now, what--so you said you got along with Arthur Lenmon [sic.] though. He--
Speaker 2: Liman [Arthur L. Liman], very well.
Speaker 1: Liman, I'm sorry. But he had a much different style than you in terms of, you know, someone said he was more cerebral.
Speaker 2: Cerebral.
Speaker 1: You're viewed as more personable, you know. Edward Bennett Williams was more of--what would you, how would you describe--would you describe his--
Speaker 2: Edward Bennett Williams was a force of nature. And I mean if I had to--if you looked at Liman on one end and Williams on the other, I'm a lot closer to Williams. And Liman, Liman was not a people person, but he was just--he was so smart that it didn't make any difference. But he was one of the nicest people you'll ever meet, but he was kind of a shy man, whereas, I think Edward Bennett Williams and myself are probably closer in personality.
Speaker 1: Now, speaking of him, you've spoken about him, what role was he playing during all this whole period of your--
Speaker 2: This is Edward Bennett Williams?
Speaker 1: --yes, with you? I mean I'm just--you know, I know the role he played earlier--
Speaker 2: Sure. I mean we were, I mean our role was--he and I went on the board of trustees of Holy Cross [College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Massachusetts] together, and we were probably on the board right up until the time of his death. So we probably served on the board for fifteen years, maybe twelve years together. And we stayed in touch both on the board of Holy Cross and also in cases. I mean, so I've, you know, I had cases where Williams and I were both involved and he was a mentor and somebody I could talk to.
Speaker 1: Did you tell him of your respect for him, I mean he knew that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 542823
Speaker 1: Let's go to your move here, though. So you make the decision what--this is two--
Speaker 2: I came here in January of 2000.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you made the decision at the end of 1999?
Speaker 2: The decision was made right up at the last moment and--'cause I was going back and forth. This was, it was very gut wrenching, 'cause I was very happy in New Jersey. You know, some people leave because they're not happy where they are. And, you know, my--the real issue for me is, even though I was happy, was this the right thing to do? And so I made it, and you can look at articles in my office. I think they announced it December 28th or December 27th or maybe December 20--maybe it was right before Christmas. It was made right at the end. In fact, we did it 'cause I didn't want to embarrass, you know, embarrass my firm [Lowenstein, Sandler, Brochin, Kohl, Fisher and Boylan; Lowenstein Sandler LLP]. And I started, I took a week off, and I started here that Monday, 'cause I had to try the Lauersen case [United States v. Lauersen]. I'd been here--I started here the first week of January, but I tried, Niels' [Niels Lauersen] case that I already had when I was in Jersey, I tried that case--I think it went to trial January 24th. So I came here [Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP], had rented furniture, still have the same rented furniture. I never--I've been here ever since 2000, and I never got--they're still renting the furniture. I don't know if it they bought it or not. I don't care about clothes and I don't care about furniture (laughter), so I still got this old furniture down in my office that I had the first day. But I came, and I, I had to go right to trial. And I remember I was over here, and I didn't know anybody, and all I knew is I had three weeks to prepare a very high profile case. And I was trying to learn, the biggest thing in my life right then was trying to learn how you did a laparoscopy and I'm very good with financial statements. I'm not the best when it comes to science, and I was having a real hard time conceptualizing just how the fertility process worked and what exactly Niels would do as a fertility doctor and it all came into--it all came together though 'cause Niels had one of his patients permit me to come and watch her be fertilized. And when I looked through the microscope, through to the telescope and really saw the whole reproductive system, after that in court, you would have thought I was Dr. Wells [HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.] 'cause I--it was funny. It just clicked, but until I really looked through the telescope, I would look through--they had models and kits they got (laughter)--but I didn't believe it, I guess. Then I looked in the telescope and I was, after that I was explaining it. And I still got my forceps somewhere down in my office. I mean, 'cause I wanted to, I needed to understand not only how he did the fertility treatment, I needed to understand how you did a D and C [dilation and curettage], and how you aspirated a cyst, 'cause I had to explain all of this. So that's what you have to do. You have to really become the expert of experts, no matter, whatever the area. I mean when I did the secretary of labor, Donovan [Raymond J. Donovan] case, I had to learn how the subway system is built, had to learn all the union rules. You know, so you've got to learn the facts that are involved in the various cases you're trying 'cause that's, cause you are--you're the storyteller. And you're explaining to the jury what took place. And you've got to do it, do with a level of confidence and do it in a way to convince those jurors that you know it better than anybody else 'cause what you're doing, in part, is trying to make them have confidence in you and your credibility.
Story_ID: 542824
Speaker 1: So now, with that, when you came here, so did you bring anyone else with you from Lowenstein [Lowenstein, Sandler, Brochin, Kohl, Fisher and Boylan; Lowenstein Sandler LLP] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: You came by yourself? Oh.
Speaker 2: But I, but I had known people here because Milken [United States v. Milken]--Milken was not a one shot case. After Milken [Michael Milken] pled guilty, I continued to work with Paul, Weiss [Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP] on the appeal. Then they had post-conviction hearings. And then the, and then the federal government hired David Boies at Cravath [Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP] to bring a lawsuit on behalf of the FDIC [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation] basically charging Mike civilly with the entire collapse of all the S and Ls [savings and loans] in the country. So I must have, so Mike then hired me to work with Paul, Weiss on the civil S and L cases, and we must have done that for three years. So we were working together for a number of years. So it wasn't, you know, it wasn't a situation where the Paul, Weiss firm was foreign to me.
Speaker 1: Right, but you know different places have different cultures, but you seem to--I mean a lot of times it's not uncommon that people will follow people to new practices.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But you're sort of a lone--are you a lone wolf?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I mean I'll go into a hotel, and I'm happy by myself. And I'll go from team to team. And when I was at, when I was at Lowenstein, I had a right hand guy by the name Bob Krakower [Robert L. Krakower]. And Bob left and retired at a young age and moved to Montserrat. A white guy indicted, he indicated--he was a white guy and he adopted two black kids. And he decided he wanted to raise them in the Caribbean. So he and his wife quit their jobs and moved to the Caribbean. And they did a lot of research on where they should go, and to show you how research sometimes turns out wrong, they decided to go to Montserrat. And they were in Montserrat for about a year living next to this volcano that had been dormant for a hundred years, and the doggone volcano became active about a year after they were there, destroyed their house, half the island. But Bob was my right hand person, and when he left, you know, that--it was, I understood it, but it was real sad. But he was my right hand person at Lowenstein, but I never, since I've been here, kind of a lone wolf. And even there, I was kind of a lone wolf.
Story_ID: 542825
Speaker 1: Now, Floyd Flake's case [United States v. Flake, 1992], was that here?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we tried, we tried Floyd's case in the Eastern District [U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York] in Brooklyn [New York].
Speaker 1: Can you set the parameters for that, I mean the background for that if you don't mind?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, I was, I represented, Elaine [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Elaine Flake], Floyd's wife. Gus Newman [Gustave Newman] represented Floyd [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Floyd Flake]. Originally, when the grand jury investigation started, they were looking at one of Floyd's chief staffers. That's how I originally came to the case, and I represented the staffer in the grand jury. And then they said they were going to indict, and Floyd--and they said they were going to indict Floyd and his wife, Elaine. And the question, and so Elaine asked me to represent her, and Floyd asked me to represent her. We tried, Gus, who was Floyd's lawyer, and we tried it together, basically interchangeable. And basic allegation was that in the course of building a school connected with Floyd's church, Allen A.M.E. [Greater Allen A.M.E. Cathedral of New York, Jamaica, New York], that they had misused federal dollars in connection with building a school and how the--and then they got into really how the church was being funded. And it was whole intermixture of the church finances and federal government money. And we tried it in Brooklyn, and they threw the case out at the end. The government--when the government rushed it, we got the judge to throw the whole case out, didn't even have to put in evidence; threw it out. It was terrible, a terrible loss for the government, front page of the paper. And, but I'll never forget, Floyd and Elaine, every day they just sat there, and they read the Bible, and they didn't bother you. They didn't ask any questions. They said, God will take care of you. And I'll never forget, they threw the case out right before Good Friday. And that Easter Sunday, Floyd preached at his church, Allen A.M.E., and he talked about the Resurrection, and it was one of the most amazing sermons I've ever heard. And we even spoke, we spoke, we spoke at the church. I think we had a big victory rally at the church that Friday or Saturday. But that Sunday when he talked about the Resurrection and talked about how he was close to being dead; now God was with him, and now, you know, the judge had thrown the case out. It was, it was amazing.
Story_ID: 542826
Speaker 1: That's what I mean about history. I mean I had to learn all about the history of the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church. When I gave my opening statement, in Floyd's case [United States v. Flake, 1992], we had people in the audience yelling out amen, and the judge, the judge started yelling at the people, saying you can't do that (laughter). But, but that's what I mean. You've got to learn--whatever the factual background of your case, you know, when I was representing Philip Morris [Philip Morris Inc.; Altria Group, Inc.], I had this, you know, I spent a year just trying to learn how cigarettes were built, where you put the holes in the cigarettes, the whole technology of cigarette construction, all of the issues of how smoking impacts health. I became the addiction expert, okay, 'cause we had to cross examination some of the top addiction people in the country. I mean you've got to be almost like a Renaissance person 'cause you have to go from discipline to discipline. One day you might be building a subway tunnel, another day you might be trying to understand diseases and cigarette technology. And the next day you might be trying to learn how the A.M.E. church is structured. Another time you might be trying to learn how a presidential campaign is structured to understand the financing aspects. So it's, it's a fascinating way to make a living.
Speaker 2: That's--so in all, really, in all senses, you're a generalist, a specialist and a generalist at the same time. But I'm sort of very interested in how you go about approaching a case. I mean how do you go about approaching and becoming knowledgeable about something? That's what I'm trying to--
Speaker 1: Well, you start, well, the first thing you try to do (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I mean how you do it.
Speaker 1: Well, the first thing I do is try to do is figure out what is the case about at a human level, 'cause I believe all these cases at the end of the day come down to people and how people see the world, and some people may see the world one way, and other people may see the world in another, but I really try to humanize every case, no matter how technical the charges or technical the industry. What's really going on at the most basic human level? What are people arguing about? And what's really important and what's not important 'cause I'm--I really believe one of the things I'm pretty good at is moving away the unimportant stuff and getting right to the guts of the case. And then you've got to figure out what facts are important to learn. And then you're gonna have to go to the books. You've got to go to the books and try and learn what you feel you need to know to communicate. So I'm gonna represent Niels Lauersen and I'm gonna talk about in vitro fertilization, I've got to learn how to do it. I mean I actually watched the eggs being fertilized and, you know, how they would take--and put the sperm into the egg. You have to watch. I need to see things. I need to kick the tires. I don't, just reading about it is not enough for me. I really need to go out and just understand what's going on.
Story_ID: 542827
Speaker 1: So let's talk about Merck [Merck and Co., Inc.] because that involved, first of all, Kenny Frazier [HistoryMaker Kenneth C. Frazier].
Speaker 2: Ken Frazier as general counsel.
Speaker 1: As general counsel. He's on the other side?
Speaker 2: He's my, he's my--he hired me.
Speaker 1: I mean he hired you, okay, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it that way. He hired you so, let's--and you knew Ken, you knew Ken Frazier?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: And he'd hired me before. I'd worked for Merck before.
Speaker 1: Okay, so can we talk about this particular case?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Okay, which--see, I look at it as significant because he's in a significant position. He's African American.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You're African American.
Speaker 2: I can talk about all that.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, let's talk about that, okay.
Speaker 2: Well, the Merck case is an ongoing case. It involves the issue of how Merck marketed its drug known as Vioxx, whether or not Merck, at the time it marketed its drug, knew that the drug might cause heart attacks. There's a huge case, involved congressional investigations. It was one of the biggest voluntary pull backs 'cause Merck decided to take it off its market--off the market on its own. Right now, as I speak, we've got fifteen thousand cases filed against the company and pending. We've got a grand jury investigation. We've got an SEC [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission] investigation. My job is, I'm in charge of the SEC investigation and I'm in charge of the grand jury investigation. They've got a whole team of civil lawyers who are trying the civil cases. I'm not trying those cases. I'm trying to--trying not to get caught in that 'cause if you start trying those civil cases, you might be doing it for the next twenty years 'cause they've got--that may be how long it takes. Ken Frazier's the general counsel of Merck. He's African American, graduate of Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts], one of the most brilliant general counsels in the country. I had worked for Merck before. When Merck had a huge securities fraud case involving billions of dollars, Ken came to me, and I handled that, got the case dismissed. Ken hired me the first week he was on the job 'cause they had a huge issue dealing with trying to prevent certain employees from going into competition with them who had anti-compete agreements. And the first he was on the job, he hired me for one of the most important cases in the company. So Ken has always turned to me from the beginning when he's had major, major issues.
Speaker 1: Now, Ken became general counsel in what year? It was after you--
Speaker 2: Probably, nah- maybe ninety--in the late '90s [1990s] 'cause my--when I first worked with Ken, I was Lowenstein [Lowenstein, Sandler, Brochin, Kohl, Fisher and Boylan; Lowenstein Sandler LLP]. So I can't give you the date, but I was already at, I was at Lowenstein.
Speaker 1: And Vioxx, just give some sense about that. I mean it was a very popular, one of the most popular or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --most popular drugs to come on the market because of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, and Vioxx was a drug aimed at relieving pain if you had arthritis or other types of pain, and the problem, problems with the traditional painkillers is that they have the potential to interfere with your stomach and cause ulcers. And Vioxx was supposed to have the same benefits of the traditional pain relievers without causing the stomach problems. And if you--and the stomach problems are very real for people who take, you know, they're called naproxens, these drugs can give you ulcers and a lot of people have, you know, have bleeding. So the question is, you know, what can you take that will relieve your pain and not cause the stomach problems. And Vioxx and another drug by Pfizer [Pfizer Inc.], Celebrex, were supposed to have the answer. But at least there are studies that show that both Vioxx and Celebrex can cause problems with your heart system. And the case, as I said, is ongoing as we speak. And it's what you call a piece of bet the company litigation because fifteen thousand cases, if valued too high, could, in theory at least, put the company out of business. You're talking about billions and billions of dollars' worth of potential damages. The company's view is it's gonna try these cases, and that it's right. And at the moment, as we speak, the company has won more cases than it's lost. And I think we're starting to establish to the world, that the company didn't do anything wrong. And we're gonna continue to press our case.
Speaker 1: You know what is amazing about the, you know, Ken Frazier situation if we had, you know, would look back, I don't know, maybe, maybe fifteen years, maybe less than that, that, you know, here he is general counsel of a major company. You are the top litigator, one of the top litigators in the country. There's no race. I mean, and you had talked about that, but there is actually no race, and it's millions and millions of dollars involved.
Speaker 2: Billions.
Speaker 1: Billions, billions of dollars involved. And, and so that's amazing, and it does, you know, one's heart good. So let's--but there's still too little of that.
Story_ID: 542828
Speaker 1: Let's go to the Frank Quattrone case [United States v. Quattrone, 2006]?
Speaker 2: Sure. Frank Quattrone--
Speaker 1: Can you set the, you know, the background, please (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay. Well, Quattrone is viewed as the investment banker that really was most responsible for the high tech boom in Northern California. He was the person who financed most of the high tech companies during the Internet surge. He was indicted in New York [New York] by the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District [U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York] for obstruction of justice. He originally retained my good friend, John Keker, from San Francisco [California]. John tried it the first time, got a mistrial; tried it the second time. Frank was convicted. Frank then came to Paul, Weiss [Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP], to my partner, Mark Pomerantz [Mark F. Pomerantz] to do the appeal. Mark argued the appeal in the Second Circuit [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit], got the conviction reversed. And at that juncture, the court had ordered Frank to stand trial a third time. And Frank, at that juncture, met me for breakfast, and we talked and at the end of breakfast, he said, "I wanna hire you to do the third trial. I want you to be my trial lawyer." And Mark and I then set about opening negotiations with the U.S. Attorney's Office in New York to see if we could persuade them not to retry him. He'd already been on trial twice. And we ultimately persuaded the U.S. Attorney's Office in New York to give him what's called a deferred prosecution agreement whereby if Frank didn't get in any trouble for a year, all charges would be dropped. And it was a very unusual and advantageous deferred prosecution agreement 'cause a lot of these deferred prosecution agreements require you at a minimum to admit that you did something wrong or to pay some type of fine. And in Frank's case, we persuaded the government to give us an agreement where he would not have to admit to any wrongdoing. And Frank was able to continue, to state to the world what he believes and what I believe is the truth, that he had not done anything wrong. He was not required to pay any fine. There were no repercussions, and come August 24th of this year, the year will be up, and all charges will be dismissed. And just to show you how crazy the world is, I mean I finished negotiating Frank's--I moved to California to do the McCall [Charles W. McCall] case August 14th, and we entered the agreement a year ago, August 24th, and Frank--we flew out on his private jet. We left San Francisco that morning, and we flew out here, went to the hotel; got up that morning, the next day in New York, I entered the necessary statement on the record that we would accept the deferred prosecution agreement. And two hours later, we were back on the plane, just him and I flying back to California. And I was right back to preparing the McCall case (laughter).
Speaker 1: How did the deferred compen- how did that, even theory of the deferred compensation--
Speaker 2: Deferred prosecution (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Prosecution, how did that even theory come into being?
Speaker 2: Well, it came into being as a--in this case, it was more of a compromise. We wanted them to dismiss the case entirely. And I think they were reluctant just to walk away, and they agreed to do a deferred prosecution agreement. But it was, as I said, a very unusual deferred prosecution agreement.
Speaker 1: And it was--so it was a negotiated deal, not based on any legal precedents, is what I'm--
Speaker 2: Well, well--
Speaker 1: --that's what I'm trying to--
Speaker 2: Well, this animal that we called deferred prosecution agreements is fairly unique. It was kind of born in the Southern District of New York, during the Prudential Securities investigations. And that was the first time one was done with a corporation. Most of them had been done with corporations. Very few had been done with individuals, but again, the Southern District of New York is a place where a lot of unique things are done. And that's how we cut the deal. And--
Speaker 1: But you didn't answer my question. Is it negotiated or based on legal--
Speaker 2: Well, it's--well, just like the government can give you a letter saying I'm not gonna prosecute, they can give you a letter saying, I'm gonna prosecute you if you do certain things for the next year. So it's like a non-pros agreement with strings. It's like a yo-yo, and they can pull it back if certain things happen. So basically, they said, we won't prosecute you if you're a good boy for one year.
Speaker 1: So what was the theory based in the Prudential case that it even happened? That's what I'm trying--
Speaker 2: That they didn't want to formally indict Prudential (laughter). They didn't wanna indict them, and they were looking for an animal, a mechanism to say something had happened, short of an indictment, 'cause if you indict a major American corporation, sometimes they can get put out of business, a la Arthur Andersen [Arthur Andersen LLP v. United States, 2005]. So in my business, these deferred prosecution agreements, they're kind of what we call the flavor of the month. They're mainly done in the corporate setting, but they're done as a way to spank the hands of the corporation without formally indicting them because a formal indictment, as I said, can have terrible repercussions to the company and its workforce.
Story_ID: 542829
Speaker 1: So in many ways, this points to some of the theory behind, you know, that decisions are made on, like the Arthur Andersen [Arthur Andersen LLP v. United States, 2005]--speaking of, that's a very good thing to just touch upon a moment. With the Arthur Andersen, you weren't involved in that case at all?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Would you have handled that case differently, because that was a major, like it just disappeared.
Speaker 2: I mean I wasn't involved. My firm represented Citigroup [Citigroup Inc.]. And so we weren't involved in the criminal prosecution, but in terms of when the civil cases started arising out of Enron [Enron Corporation], Citigroup really was the biggest pocket, and we probably spent three years doing nothing but defending Citi and Enron cases. So in that sense, we were involved. But--
Speaker 1: But Citigroup didn't disappear. It just like disappeared.
Speaker 2: And we didn't--well, they didn't 'cause we didn't do anything. We were just left--the company had blown up, and what happens in a lot of these cases, people look around for somebody to sue, and very often the best people to sue are the big banks that financed it 'cause they the position, oh, you should have known, in some way you were part of it. And Citi wasn't part of anything, but we ended up for three years defending them. But I mean if you look at Arthur Andersen, I mean in theory, Arthur Andersen did everything--once the investigation started, that they tell companies to do. Arthur Andersen reported to the government that there were problems. They said about, you know, destruction of documents or what have you. They reported all that. The government didn't know about it. They went to the government, and then the government turned around and charged them based on what the government was told. And then they weren't able to operate a deal. It was kind of like two people playing chicken and nobody backed off. The cars ended up crashing. But it was a terrible situation 'cause you had put fifty thousand people out on the street, and if you look at what has taken place since the Arthur Andersen case, very few major American corporations have been formally indicted because the federal took, you know, got such a black eye based on all those people losing their jobs. And that's why these deferred prosecution agreements have started to grow so rapidly after Arthur Andersen 'cause people are looking for a way, again, to, you know, slap their wrist without putting them in the position of an Arthur Andersen. So KPMG [KPMG LLP], for example, just entered into a deferred prosecution agreement involving all these tax shelters as opposed to being indicted. And KPMG will continue to survive. Bob Bennett [Robert S. Bennett], out of D.C. [Washington, D.C.], represented them and did that deal.
Speaker 1: So you had, had you represented Arthur Andersen, would you have taken a different approach? Do you think you could have ended up with a different--
Speaker 2: I, I mean, I, I don't know. It's too complicated a case to say if I would have made difference because personalities probably had a lot to do with it. You had Mike Chertoff [Michael Chertoff], who was the head of Criminal Division, making the decisions for the justice department [U.S. Department of Justice]. You had very good lawyers for Arthur Andersen, but something went wrong. And I--it being, I wasn't there, and whatever went wrong, I still believe it was at a people level. Somebody on, you know, and people were talking past each other and whether I could have made a difference, I don't know. That wouldn't be fair. I don't know. But I know there were talented people on both sides, but despite all the talent on both sides, they went right to the brink. I mean look at it, the conviction's been reversed. The company was convicted. The company goes out of business. They go to the U.S. Supreme Court. There's a reversal. The Arthur Andersen reversal played a huge role in the reversal of Frank Quattrone's case [United States v. Quattrone, 2006]. It shows, my life always--everything becomes connected. But what good is there to get a reversal if the company's gone out of business. But whatever happened in that case, the prosecutors and the defense lawyers weren't able to figure out a solution that would have saved thousands and thousands of jobs. And whether I could have made a difference, I don't have a clue.

Speaker 1: Let's talk about Scooter Libby [United States v. Libby, 2007], what you can talk about.
Speaker 2: Sure (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Really, I wanna talk about--because this was, let's see, this is your, were there--besides Espy [United States v. Espy, 1998], were you, was this the only other case that you had involving, you know, the presidency, you know, someone--
Speaker 2: No, I had Donovan [Raymond J. Donovan].
Speaker 1: You had Donovan, sorry. I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: I mean Donovan was this, Donavan was the secretary--
Speaker 1: Okay, that's right.
Speaker 2: --of labor under Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Espy was the secretary of agriculture under Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.]. Senator Torricelli was, he was head of the senate finance committee [U.S. Senate Committee on Finance], involved right with the, you know, with the president--the finance, the campaign finance is all related to Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton], Haney [Franklin L. Haney] related. I had a lot of cases dealing with high level politicians of both parties.
Speaker 1: Okay, but Scooter is a little different too because the, another lawyer. It's sort of, I mean he's not--
Speaker 2: Mike's [Mike Espy] a lawyer, Mike was a lawyer.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's true, that's true.
Speaker 2: I tell you. I've represented plenty of lawyers. What made Scooter--
Speaker 1: But, no, no--
Speaker 2: --what made Scooter Libby's case different is it was done in the middle of a war [Iraq War]. That's what made Scooter Libby's case different. I--there were--
Speaker 1: For you--
Speaker 2: For everybody. It was a whole different dimension. We're in the middle of an unpopular war in real time, not, not we had been in war and Scooter had something to do with the war and the case was about the war, but the war was over. No. Scooter Libby's case became the poster child for what was wrong with the Bush [President George Walker Bush] administration and going to war. We tried the doggone thing in real time. I picked the jury starting around January 15th or 16th. It was the same week that the Democrats took [U.S.] Congress back over. Every day in The Washington Post, it was front page articles, criticizing how the Republicans were running the war, how the Democrats were gonna fix things now that they were in control. I think the second week of the trial, we had a huge anti-war protest. I'll never forget, I was walking down the street that, that Saturday and people, fifty, a hundred thousand people in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] protesting the war, and here I'm in the middle of trying a case where the background issue was whether or not the Bush administration lied to the American public about the reasons for going to war, and that time, the war's still going on. This was real time. That's what made the Libby case different. It was the war. It was a real--you know, it was not just a person who was in a high government position. Whether Mike Espy took gratuities or took tickets, it was really of no moment to anyone other than he had a high position. Whether Raymond Donovan engaged in some type of corporate malfeasance before he became secretary of labor did not touch the American people. Whether Senator Robert Torricelli did something wrong with how he raised money for the senatorial campaign was still not something that touched anybody beyond how he raised money; same thing with Franklin Haney. Whether Floyd Flake [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Floyd Flake], popular congressman from Brooklyn [New York], maybe the next mayor, was supposed to be the next mayor in New York [New York], it only touched people, again, because of his stature. It had no personal connection as to how they built the school out in Queens [New York]. In contrast, Scooter Libby's case involved the issue of whether the public had been lied to by the Bush administration, whether Cheney [Dick Cheney] had lied to people in the Bush administration about a war that was going on in real time where people are still arguing as I speak to you today about why we went to war, what Congress was told, was Congress told the truth, how Democrat- how were the Democrats who were running for president going to defend the fact that they voted for the war? This is all real time. When we--people talk about Scooter's recent commutation, it's still done in the context of an upcoming presidential election where this doggone war is front and center. That's what made it, made it different. In those other cases, those people's status made it different. If Scooter had done something wrong and he was the chief of staff to the president or the vice president, it still would have got a lot of publicity, but it would have been personalized to Scooter. This was, this case, as I said, became the poster child for the whole war.
Story_ID: 542831
Speaker 1: So how do you approach something like that then, since, you know, we always do our research? How were you approaching that then?
Speaker 2: Well, you took--first you had to be cleared. You had to spend weeks getting top secret clearance, where they spent weeks examining my life, the life of everybody on my team so we could get, you know, clearance at the highest level so we could read the documents to understand the case [United States v. Libby, 2007]. And then they spent weeks in what are called SIPA [ph.] hearings, closed hearings, arguing about what documents you can use and what documents you can't use. So it's the same type of learning experience, only it's not--everything is done in the context of classified information. And, you know, what, what ultimately was disclosed at trial is what the court ruled was permissible after hearings and debate when, you know, in closed hearings, that everybody knows take--took place. But I can't talk about them. But it's like any other case. You have to learn the facts, but only this was different because 90 percent of what you had to learn was not only top secret, but you only could learn it in what's called the SCIF, S-C-I-F. And that's, stands for sensitive classified information facility [sic. sensitive compartmented information facility]. And that's just a fancy word for whatever room they say is a SCIF. And they put all the top secret documents in there with safes and all sorts of equipment. And you can only look at the documents in that room. You can only talk about the documents in that room. You can only type on a computer that's been cleared in that room. So it's different, and our SCIF was like a little, teeny jury room. I mean, I mean so, you know, for over a year, we were working in cramped quarters. I mean, you know, it was one of the most difficult things I've ever had to do for all of us. You know, a long time before we had even a copy machine. And you couldn't take your notes out. That's what made it, you know, it was classified information, but--so just like at Donovan [Raymond J. Donovan], you had to learn about subway, Espy [United States v. Espy, 1998], you had to learn about various agricultural policy. Here you had to read all the documents about why we did go to war to try to figure out how do you rebut the claim that the Bush [President George Walker Bush] administration didn't lie to the people. And how do you rebut the claims of Wilson [Joseph C. Wilson]. But everything was done, as I said, in the context of classified information, which we can't, you know, can't talk about beyond what was disclosed in the courtroom.
Story_ID: 542832
Speaker 1: When you look at all the cases you have done, which ones would you consider--I mean there's a lot of them, but which ones have been defining moments for you and why?
Speaker 2: I mean I think you--there are defining moments depending on your stage in life.
Speaker 1: Okay, at this point.
Speaker 2: I mean I would think, I tell people when I started out in New Jersey, my defining case that put me on the map as a lawyer in New Jersey, made me a statewide figure in New Jersey was the Ruvoldt [Harold J. Ruvoldt, Jr.] case. Again, a case nobody said could be won and a case I did win. When I put myself in the position of saying what was the case that put me on the national spotlight, it's probably the Donovan [Raymond J. Donovan] case 'cause it was a national case, front page of the papers every day, nationally, first sitting cabinet member to be indicted in over a hundred years. Again, a case people said we could not win. We won. So that was a national case. I mean those were, you know, Ruvoldt was my statewide case, Donovan was my national case, representing Jay Regan [James Sutton Regan] in the Princeton/Newport [Princeton/Newport Partners] investigation was my entre case into the financial services community, and to representing Wall Street. And Regan and Milken [United States v. Milken] were my Wall Street cases. That is what made me one of the lawyers, the go to lawyers for Wall Street. And that's different 'cause I'd cross in different worlds. So I could live in a world where, there's some lawyers who may say, well, I do political corruption cases, and I'm the person. Well, I do political corruption cases. Other people say, well, I do securities fraud cases. I do Wall Street cases. Well, I say, I do those cases too. I do Milken, I do Regan, I do Michael Steinhardt, I do--I was doing the hedge fund cases before people knew what hedge funds were. Other people say I do toxic tort cases. Okay, I do the Vioxx cases, I do the tobacco cases. Well, I do big tobacco, I do Vioxx. So I do that. Other people say, I'm an environmental lawyer. When Exxon [Exxon Mobil Corporation] spilled millions of gallons of oil in Arthur Kill [Staten Island Sound], I was Exxon's environmental lawyer. Exxon was sued last Tuesday by Cuomo [Andrew Cuomo] for environmental violations in Brooklyn [New York]. They say half of Brooklyn is sitting on top of 17 million gallons of oil that was spilled in the 1950s, one of the biggest environmental cases in the country, okay, it was just filed last Tuesday. I'm, I'm Exxon's lawyer in that case. I spent all day last week walking around Brooklyn, out in the fields trying to understand where the oil was spilled, where it might have gone, okay. So, I cross over all fields, all sectors, okay. I can do tax cases. If it's in a courtroom, I can do it. I don't care whether it's an environmental case, a securities case, political corruption case, doesn't make any difference. Now, some cases I turn down because it doesn't fit with my brand image. I don't, I haven't--I turn down a lot of requests to represent say some athletes in trouble or--'cause it's, I would rather, I'm representing major politicians, major corporations, major executives and it's hard to do that if you're also, say running around representing certain people on other ends of the business, okay. So certain cases, I get asked to do, but I don't do them 'cause it's not a--in terms of where you're trying to position yourself in the market, it's not consistent.
Story_ID: 542833
Speaker 1: Where is your career? What do you wanna still do that you haven't done? God knows--
Speaker 2: I'd like to give Scooter [Scooter Libby] a pardon, and get rid of the commuting the sentence. But, I mean in terms of my career, my--look, I just wanna keep growing this litigation department [at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP]. My, my big thing outside of my career is the NAACP Legal Defense Fund [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.]. I'm the co-chair of that, with Bill Lewis [HistoryMaker William M. Lewis, Jr.] and, you know, I don't have time to do it, but Vernon Jordan [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.] told me I had no choice but to do it. So I usually do what Vernon says so--and he's right. And I'm trying to help LDF. I believe I'm a Brown versus Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] baby, and I was--I think everything I've got is because of LDF lawyers and the Brown decision, so I'm gonna do my best to work for LDF. And, you know, people sometimes say, oh, is LDF--have they outlived their time? Well, you look at the U.S. Supreme Court, you know, two weeks ago, issued a decision in the Seattle [Washington] and Louisville [Kentucky] cases, basically saying school districts couldn't use voluntary efforts to desegregate. And they really showed how nothing's changed. Those people were trying to--who wrote the majority decision, they're trying to dismantle Brown. And I'm gonna try and keep protecting Brown. And they even had the audacity to try to use some of the principles of Brown, the language of Brown to justify what they did. I thought it was the most outrageous thing I ever saw. I mean Justice Roberts [John Roberts], what did he write, "If you want to end discrimination, end discrimination," I mean what the hell does that mean? I mean I don't know what, you know, I mean for a brilliant man, it's kind of a stupid comment.
Story_ID: 542834
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I was saying that you're somewhat of an oxymoron, that's what I was saying, that some--and you appear not to have sold out, but how you manage all these different things together, and it's one package (cough), because some, you know, in some instances, you know, you should be a Republican, you should be a Clarence Thomas in some instances--
Speaker 2: I'm nothing like Clarence. My politics are far to the left, his politics are far to the right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) I know but--I know, but I'm just saying that some people can't put all those things together in one person.
Speaker 2: Well, that's their problem, not mine--
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter)--
Speaker 2: --I mean that's the--
Speaker 1: But let's talk about--
Speaker 2: --what is it, Holmes [sic. Ralph Waldo Emerson] said, "Consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds."
Story_ID: 542835
Speaker 1: So let's talk about how, why LDF [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.], why that is important to you and how you bring some things that look contradictory together, you know, in some respects. I mean your politics with your client base. (Whispering off camera).
Speaker 2: Well, if you wanna talk about LDF, LDF is important because there continue to be forces in this country that are trying to turn back the gains of the Civil Rights Movement, that are trying to hijack the language and principles of the Civil Rights Movement in an effort to really discriminate against black people. There are forces in the country that don't want to confront the fact that for two hundred years, this country engaged in formal segregation, and that it's going to take some consideration of race conscious remedies in order to correct the impact of the period of slavery and Jim Crow legislation and under the radar racism and segregation. So LDF has a, has plenty of work to do. I mean in terms of affirmative action and higher education, you've got people now saying that race can't be considered. Look at what happened in California, you go to Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California] now, there are no black kids in the law school or the medical school. You go to UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], there are no black kids in the law school, in the medical school. And when I say, none, there's seven, eight, nine. And I'm not exaggerating, seven, eight or nine, because they've passed this proposition that says they can't take race into consideration. Okay, they just passed the referendum in Michigan [Gratz v. Bollinger, 2003] saying the say--same thing, you know, god forbid what's going to happen to the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], one of the great universities in the country. Is it gonna now look like Berkeley and UCLA, and now they wanna go off and have these referendums in other states. I think people are talking about California next. I mean there, there's a war going on against black people, against Latinos, against people who have suffered years and years of formal and informal discrimination and are now trying to become, you know, parts of this society by training their children to be players and to get the best this country has to offer in terms of education. And people are trying to say, oh, no, you can't take race into consideration. Well, for years race was used and all we're saying is that you ought to be able to use it for purposes of a remedy and just because somebody's trying to use race for purposes of a remedy, in no way should that be equated with the same thing as when people were trying to engage in formal segregation. That's kind of the--you know, that's one of the big arguments. We're gonna continue to have those arguments. If you look at the criminal justice system, I mean one out of three black males, in their lifetime, will be incarcerated. I mean for a black boy--a black child is born, male child is born today, people can say statistically, one out of three is gonna spend some time in jail. I mean we, you know, we're creating this whole black underclass. We're writing away, we're really writing off a huge portion of the black male population, and the criminal justice system is a big part of it. And I mean, the distinctions that they draw between crack cocaine and powdered cocaine has an impact directly on blacks, both men and women. I mean you wanna trace the increase on a percentage basis of black folk being incarcerated, it goes right back to drug policies started in the '80s [1980s], the so called war on drugs turned out to be a war on black males. Then they get out of jail. They can't get a job. So they start fathering three, four kids. Then the kids, their parents can't get jobs, so not only does the person who went to jail, he's in trouble. Now, you got three or four kids destined to have trouble 'cause the parents can't support the kids. And you start to create a whole underclass. I mean, you know, you really sow the roots for undermining all of society. When you can't have a civil society, if everybody doesn't think they have a chance, and if you send a large portion of the black male population to prison, they will, they will design values that will permit them to survive in prison and to survive in a world where they can't get a job. And people should not, you know, be surprised at some of the craziness that takes place because people are frustrated. So LDF has a huge role to play. I'm determined to make sure that diversity becomes real in this country and that diversity efforts are not undermined. And I'm gonna spend a lot of my time making sure that LDF grows and has the financial were-the-all so we can fight those battles.

Speaker 1: In terms of my politics, there's nothing inconsistent with my trying to be one of the best corporate trial lawyers in the history of this country. And that's not something reserved for white males, okay. And I think--and if I sit down with a major company that has a problem, I sit down--I try to anyway, as a truth teller. And I'm happy to represent those companies that wanna kind of confront the truth, and let's figure out how to go forward with the truth in mind and try to deal with it that way. And the companies I, that I'm dealing with, that's how we do it. Now, if they wanna do it some other way, I might not be the right lawyer for them. But I'll tell you, you take Philip Morris [Philip Morris Inc.; Altria Group, Inc.], for example, I'm happy to represent Philip Morris. As long as Congress says that people can sell tobacco in this country, one of the real tasks for a company like Philip Morris, is, how do you sell an inherently dangerous product in a responsible way, okay. Congress has said, you can sell the product. We all know it's inherently dangerous. Then how do you go about it? Forget the years, people said in the 1950s or 1960s, the company wasn't being honest. Whether that's right or wrong, in 2007, how do you confront reality? How do you go forward and do it right? These are great legal issues, great social issues, all sorts of stakeholders. I don't mind sitting at the table with people trying to grapple with that answer. Now, if somebody else wants to say there's a political answer, you wanna ban tobacco. That's a political question. And nobody hired me to do, engage, you know, to be the czar of the universe and weigh in on the political question. But once the U.S. Congress has said you can sell an inherently dangerous product, well, how do you go about it in a responsible way. That's not an oxymoron. There's got to be a right way to do it. Maybe it's federal--maybe it's federal regulation by the FDA [Food and Drug Administration]. My client, Philip Morris supports federal drug--federal regulations. These are complex problems, fascinating problems. I'm, I'm glad to represent my clients. I don't see anything inconsistent with my politics, you know, at all.
Speaker 2: I just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You know, I'm a Democrat, and I think Scooter Libby deserves a defense. I think everybody deserves a defense.
Story_ID: 542837
Speaker 1: Let me ask this in the context though of new black--do you think there's a new black paradigm, a new black leader emerging or--well, I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, look, look, I mean, yeah. But--
Speaker 1: And do you think you're representative of that in a way or--
Speaker 2: I haven't given that any thought to be candid with you. I thought you were talking more on the political side 'cause I guess I wear--I'm not a politician. So I, but I thought you were asking me a question about politicians. But there's no question we live in a more complex world and that things are evolving. At one time we were shut out from the political process. So we lived in a world where our leaders really grew out of the black church and the black Civil Rights Movement. And what was part of the movement about? It was trying to get political power. So, okay, so there came a time when we had political power. Now, we've got black politicians. Then the question is, well, what happens to the power based within the black church or the power based within the civil rights organizations 'cause in theory, they've opened it up. And now, we've got a black caucus [Congressional Black Caucus]. So how do those various models work together? And for a while, people kind of grew out of both communities. Now, you have situations where politicians are coming to the fore, not roots necessarily in the black church or in the black Civil Rights Movement, okay, just black politicians. Then the question is, well, what happens if you look up one day and some of your black politicians aren't as responsible and receptive to the needs of the community as you think they should be. And what happens if you look up and find out, doggone it, you know what, when white politicians were in charge and they were stealing, we thought things would be different if black politicians were put in charge. What happens if you find some of them have the same human frailties as the white politician? Now, what happens when we finally integrate Corporate America? Okay, so what are the obligations of a Ken Chenault [Kenneth Chenault] at American Express [American Express Company]? What are the obligations of a Dick Parsons [HistoryMaker Richard Parsons] at Time Warner [Time Warner Inc.], you know, very com- very complicated issues. We're like at the point of the spear. This is, you know, fighting racism in America is an ongoing battle of, you know, it's not gonna be over in my time nor in the time of my children [Phillip Wells and Teresa Wells]. And the responsibilities of black people have to continually be examined and reflected upon and how do we juggle this world where suddenly we're permitted to be players in society, but at the same time, all of our people are not. And so you've got to have a degree of social responsibility and recognition of your role and where you are in society, but full recognition at all times that just because you've done well, if you look back in terms of statistics or raw numbers, you know, most of the race has not done that well. And how do you reach back, and how do you also continue to recognize that you aren't special. The only reason you got where you got is 'cause some people were protesting and fighting and sacrificing with full expectation that if you got somewhere, you would reach back and you'd continue to have those responsibilities.

Speaker 1: So is that really your hope for the black community? That they would act in--be put in action consistent with what you just said. Is that what your--what are your hopes--I mean, like what do you think will make things better? Let me ask that.
Speaker 2: I just, look, I think you have to continue to fight stereotypes. I mean as much as I disagree with the policies of President Bush [President George Walker Bush], in terms of fighting stereotypes, having a black woman as secretary of state and national security advisor, during a time of war, has been good for the country, you know, 'cause people who look at Condoleezza Rice and you don't hear anything about race. You talk about Condoleezza Rice. You may dislike her policies, as I do, but it's good to have people in those power positions. It's good to have a Colin Powell [HistoryMaker General Colin L. Powell] as secretary of state. I'm waiting to see when we have our first black attorney general. I hope Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] becomes the first African American president. I pray for it, not just 'cause I think Barack is special but because I think it breaks stereotypes, and we've got to keep breaking stereotypes so that race doesn't become an issue. I think it's good that I'm in cases that have no race component, okay. It's just not, it's just not an issue. It's just, Ted's [HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.] a great lawyer. It doesn't make any difference what color he is. He's just a great lawyer. That's good for the country. And you--and look, each generation is different. I mean I come out of the--I'm born and raised in the Civil Rights Movement. I know when people talk about somebody as a race person or a race man, I know what that's about. And that's kind of how I was raised. And I'll always see the world 'cause I've been burdened by everything I've lived through and seen. And my kids [Phillip Wells and Teresa Wells] will be a little different and their kids will be a little different but they live in a more diverse society. And that's why so bad what people are doing with some of these [U.S.] Supreme Court decisions. They really are trying to re-segregate America under the guise of saying the [U.S.] Constitution is colorblind. That's code, that's a code word for turning back affirmative action efforts. Those are code words. Those same people that criticize affirmative action efforts and say the Constitution should be colorblind, they're not doing anything to forward the effort. They're just sitting pontificating. But look at who's using those terms, okay. Look at, look at where those, you know, where this new language is coming. And like I said, people are trying to hijack the language of the Civil Rights Movement for the purposes of turning it backwards.

Speaker 1: What do you want to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: I'd like to be remembered as being one of the best trial, trial lawyers of my generation. That's what--you know, I mean I--if I could be viewed--I don't own the, look, Edward Bennett Williams owned the Washington Redskins. I don't own a sports team, never will own a sports team. But if I could be viewed like an Edward Bennett Williams as one of the best trial lawyers of my time, I'd be very happy. That's good, you know, and but not just a trial lawyer, but as kind of a citizen who was a person of consequence in various areas. I'm not a politician, but I can advise politicians. I can have an impact. Again, I can, I can be a leader at LDF [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.] but I also can represent an Exxon Mobil [Exxon Mobil Corporation] or a Philip Morris [Philip Morris Inc.; Altria Group, Inc.] or a guy I'm representing in Alabama on death row right now, okay. I mean, you know, I'm a lawyer. I'm happy I'm a lawyer. I just wanna be remembered as a--lawyers, you know, we plant our flags in a lot of different communities. Lawyers always have. We've always played a special role in this country, independent of whether you ran for office or not. And so, if I'm remembered as one of the real good lawyers of my generation, that's all, that's all you could ask for.
