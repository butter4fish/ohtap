Story_ID: 56899
Speaker 1: Now let's start with your mother.  Her name, your mother and father, their names?

Speaker 1: And your parents, do you know anything about your mother's [Sallie Dolphus] grand, your, your mother's parents and the story of where they were, where they lived, and where they [unclear]?
Speaker 2: My mother and father [Jasper Dolphus] came originally from Georgia.  They lived around Macon and Ashburn, Georgia.  I knew my mother's mother, which is Georgie, and I knew her father Henry.  When they moved to Florida, those two came down and lived in Florida for a long time, so I knew well my grandfather.  On my father's side, I heard all them, but I didn't know them.  His father, Sam Dolphus, did live at the beginning of the time when they first moved here to Florida, which was about 1925 when they moved here.
Story_ID: 56900
Speaker 1: So what, what do you know about your mother's [Sallie Dolphus]--any stories in particular that you know about your mother's grandparents, your mother's parents?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My mother's father [Henry Goddard] lived here in Pearl City [Boca Raton, Florida] area with one of her brothers, and my mother did the cooking and it was amazing sometimes some of the things that he would do like to take a bath, he took a water hose and stretched it out on the sand in the summertime.  And then we didn't have a bathroom, but we had an area that we took our bath in and we had a big number three tub.  And he would run the water through that hose into the bathtub, which would be real hot, to take his bath.  And I used to think about that all the time in connection with--he lived I guess up until about, he was about 93 years old, somewhere along in there, when he died.  But at that time he was still planning to get married.
Speaker 1: What did he do for a living?  What was his occupation?
Speaker 2: The time I knew him, he wasn't doing anything because of his age and most of the time it was just a matter of talking with the grandchildren and great-grandchildren and one thing to deviling, but his son that he lived with was in farming.  So when the produce sometime would come to the house or one thing to the other one, he might help to separate the best from the worst and whatever in connection with trying to pack them for shipping.
Speaker 1: And your [maternal] grandmother [Georgia Goddard], your mother's mother?
Speaker 2: Well my mother's mother because of her illness, she lived in Tampa, Florida most of the time.  And in fact that's where she died over there in Tampa, Florida with one of the brothers, her son, which was Scott Goddard.
Speaker 1: And the son who lived, who your grandfather lived with, his name, your mother's brother?
Speaker 2: His name is Jimmy Goddard, and he now resides right next door to my home here now.  He is the only one of the siblings from my mother's side that's still living.  His name is Jimmy Goddard and he lives next door to me.
Speaker 1: And your father's [Jasper Dolphus] parents.
Speaker 2: My father's parents as I said, I don't know anything about them, but there was his, his father was on the scene I believe when I first was born, but I never came in contact with him.  He was still up in Georgia and he died shortly maybe after I was born.
Story_ID: 56901
Speaker 1: Do you know anything about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: No, I, I really don't, other than my mother [Sallie Dolphus] used to always talk, she was dark skinned and she would always say that she wanted to marry someone that was a little bit shade lighter than she.  And so that's how she came in contact with my daddy [Jasper Dolphus] in connection with marrying him.  Because her parents had picked out someone that was a little bit darker and she said wait, I gotta take care of the kids and so I don't want all of them to be very, very dark.
Story_ID: 56902
Speaker 1: What type of woman was your mother?
Speaker 2: God-fearing person.  I mean you--she, all she had to do was look at you and you realize she means business.  And she worked in a restaurant washing dishes, paring food in the back from one thing to the other one.  And one of the ladies that she worked for, she washed for her, did her laundry.  And there were five of us girls.  And she would bring the laundry.  The other four would do the ironing, and I was the youngest one, so I was the iron carrier.  Cause we didn't have electricity.  The irons were on a coal pot outside the house.  And I had to take the iron and rub it on some wax so that it would glide well, then rub it on a cloth so that I can get that off of the bottom of the iron and take it to the other four that were doing the ironing.  And when the lady would come for her clothes, the five of us would be taking clothes out to her car, hanging some of them, putting some on the seat in the car and what have you.  So one day I asked my mama, I said, "Well how much do we get for doing this washin' and ironing?"  And she said, "Three dollars."  I said I tell you one thing Mama, if I do washin' and ironing, it will be because I want to, it won't be because I have to.  I am going to school and I'm gonna get me an education cause I don't plan to have to do this.  All this work we have done for three dollars.
Story_ID: 56903
Speaker 1: So what type of relationship did you have with your mother?
Speaker 2: Very good relationship with my mother.  I can always talk with her about any situation, any problem.  And she was always interested in my going to school.  When they got down to me being the last one of the siblings, my father was somewhat you know at the point wherein he didn't see where you need an education.  All of the other siblings had dropped out of school.  And he says, "Well she's fickle minded and one thing to the other, she's gonna drop out too and I'm not gonna waste my time on her.  We just let her stop right now."  And my mother told him that "We're gonna give her the same opportunity that we gave the others."  So I told my father, I said "In that, my mother said that, I'm going to show you that I'm going to finish high school."  So I had to go from Pearl City [Boca Raton, Florida] here, which is about eight miles south of Delray Beach [Florida], to Delray for high school [Carver High School].  So I had to catch a--the city--the school bus to go up there.  There were days when I didn't have any breakfast, that I'd go to school.  And sometimes they say that you can't do well on an empty stomach, but I know that's different.  You can if you wish to, if you have a mind made up.  The lunch up there was 16 cent to get your hotdog and your milk for lunch, it was 16 cent.  And there were times when I just didn't have 16 cent because my father had decided that he wasn't gonna waste any money on me going to school.  So I stayed in there and I also had a problem with the children in Delray because I was somewhat of a very good student.  And they didn't want anyone comin' in stealing their salutatorian or valedictorian of the class.  So I had a problem there.  So I told them, I said, "Well you don't--I'll help you.  If you don't wanna help me, fine.  I'm gonna make it."  So I did end up being the salutatorian of the class of 1946 when I graduated from high school.
Story_ID: 56904
Speaker 1: Now I wanna--you stepped, you kind of said a few words about--I'd like to know what type of man was your father [Jasper Dolphus]?
Speaker 2: My father was laid back.  I mean you know, it's all right for the most part, if you go north or south.  Usually he, he farmed.  And there were Japanese people in this area that did, had truck farmin' areas, and they had a pineapple farm and one thing to the other one around here.  And he did what you call sharecroppin'.  The Japanese owned the property.  He would buy all of the seeds, fertilizer and everything, and my father would farm the land.  And when the produce, when we got the produce and it was sold, then the Japanese fella, Kabaya [ph.], would give him a part of the money that was made.  So that's how we lived for the most part in that time from truck farming.  During that time also, there was nothing in Pearl City [Boca Raton, Florida] to do.  The only thing that was around here was Boca Raton Hotel and Club [Boca Raton Resorts & Club?].  And the tourists in the wintertime was there.  So in the summertime all you did was pick huckleberries, fish, one thing to the other.  So that was our means of trying to live.  But we got along fine.  My father raised hogs, so we had a smokehouse.  So, and we can take an alligator, an alligator, cut his tail off, smoke that meat in the smokehouse.  The fish, we kept the fish and we smoked that in the smokehouse.  So we had plenty to eat, but we didn't work in the summertime, there's nothing to do.
Speaker 1: What type of relationship did you have with your father?  Were you close?
Speaker 2: I wouldn't say very close.  It was mostly with my mother [Sallie Dolphus] and that was very close.  My father tend to think that I had too much mouth and because of my education, that I was you know, thinkin' that I can say anything I want to say but only, you know, so for that reason sometimes we didn't gel together very good.  But on the other hand, my mother was very good at helping to keep the entire family in line.  So he would listen to her and I had no problem.
Story_ID: 56905
Speaker 1: So what was your role in the household?  You said you were the youngest and you were--what was your role in the household as the youngest?
Speaker 2: Well at the, as the youngest for the most part, it was just a matter of whatever small things that I can do in the house or in the yard, you didn't have any grass in the yard.  You had a broom that you swept the yard, some little things like that that I would do.
Speaker 1: Now what is your--when you recollect back, what is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: My earliest childhood memory goes back to in elementary school that was to the east of my home right here now.  There was a teacher, Mrs. Ashley, that taught in that school.  And it was one through eighth grade in the same room and it was only a one room school.  And we called it the Pearl City School.  I can remember sittin' on the benches that the people in the area had made for you to sit on in the classroom, and my feet didn't touch the floor, so I'm swingin' there.  And I remember the outhouse that was for that particular school.  And I also remember the Parramatta (unclear) bushes behind the outhouse where the teacher would send the students, the boys, to cut Parramatta [unclear] limbs to bring in.  And they would take that rough edge off the side and she would use it for switches we call it, to keep us in order.  And she taught first through eighth grade then.  So that's about the earliest part I can remember of my childhood.
Story_ID: 56906
Speaker 1: Just two questions and one all rolled into.  First part is, even though this is Boca Raton, it was called Pearl City [Boca Raton, Florida].  I want you to explain why it's called Pearl City.  And also what was that community like in which you grew up as a child, Pearl City?
Speaker 2: We don't really know exactly how the name became Pearl City.  We say that to the southeast of where I am now, my home, there was a piece of property that was owned by Pearl Swanson and her husband.  Some think that maybe that name come from her name Pearl.  But we really don't know about that.  My uncle, J.H. Dolphus, came here to Boca Raton, one of the early settlers.  He is the organizer of the Ebenezer Missionary Baptist Church which was organized the third Sunday in November in 1918.  So with him and others around here, we had a good relationship.  The men would go on the beach and turn a turtle we call it.  Along and then getting a turtle from the Atlantic Ocean wasn't against the law.  So the men would get a truck and go over there, get a turtle, come back.  They cleaned the turtle, they divided the meat up between all of the inhabitants of this area in here, Pearl City.  And everybody had a smokehouse, so you put your turtle meat in the smokehouse and you smoked it.  If you got say the liver last time, another family get the liver this time, we divide it up.  When the meat ran out because we had no cold storage, then they went back and they turned another turtle.  And my uncle used to--he had a fishnet and he would cast the net when the mullets are runnin' and get mullets and he'd come back and he would sell the fish, ten cent a pound, two pounds for 15 cent.  So when he sold as much of the fish as he can, then he'll come back to my mother [Sallie Dolphus] house, which is his sister, and say bring the pan out.  So all this-- --from the beginning so I'll have you repeat that for us.  Sorry, we had--go ahead [OFF CAMERA VOICE].
Speaker 1: About the turtle coming back and your brother and mother--after he'd sell it.
Speaker 2: When my uncle would come to the house with the left over mullet fish that he wasn't able to sell, then he asked my mo--give it to my mama.  So then that meant that I had to clean fish, which I didn't like very well.  And again, what you can eat, you eat it.  The rest of it you put in the smokehouse and you smoke it.  We had a hog pen right in the middle of what now is Glades Road.  And when we killed a hog, you will put it on what you call cold storage.  It would be sent to West Palm Beach after it's cut up and boxed and salted, it's carried to West Palm Beach and they put it in refrigeration for like two months.  And then they bring it back.  We get it out of cold storage.  Then you can take it into the smokehouse and hang it up and, and smoke it and you have meat.  The area worked together, everybody, because I mean it was like family.  Everybody know everybody.  There were no locks on any doors.  There's nothing to steal in the first place.  But if it were a case wherein--if it was a case that one person stole something, the punishment was so severe that you just didn't have it done very often.  So everybody was everybody's else child keeper.  You couldn't do wrong in front of any adult person, not just your parent or relatives.  Which made it very good in connection with how we were brought up in here.
Story_ID: 56907
Speaker 1: Now Pearl City, let me see if I can get this correct.  Pearl City was the black area of Boca Raton.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Pearl City originally was Northeast Tenth Street, Northeast 11th Street, Northeast 12th Street between Federal Highway and Dixie Highway.  Now that's the original Pearl City.  Now since that time when the Army airbase [Boca Raton Army Airbase] came here in 1942, we had Dixie Manor project that were 42 [sic, 42] barrack-like apartments built there for the black soldiers and their wives.  And then to the north of that area, we had Yamato [colony of Japanese farmers organized in 1904] before the Army airbase.  And what happened there was this:  In '42 [1942] when the government decided to take over that land, the area up there what they call Boca Teeca now, was originally Yamato.  They call the street now up there Yamato [Road].  That area--there were really more blacks living in that area than was living here in what we call the Pearl City area.  With the Army--, with the government taking over the property, those people were moved from there up to Delray Beach and you have a section in Delray Beach called Newtown, out around where Carver Middle School is.  And the majority of those people came from right down here in what we call Yamato.  So the Army airbase after it was built, it was there from 1942 until 1948 I believe.  And the project, Dixie Manor project for the black soldiers and their wives.  So that added some more blacks to the area from there, but they had already taken away--we had like three churches up at Yamato that were moved to Delray.  Reverend Thomas church out at--in Delray originally came from Yamato.  And that property, they moved the church up there, so you have now after the Army airbase closed and the property was--you were able to buy property there, then the whites would not let any blacks buy any property in that area, which confined us to just the area where I live here now.
Story_ID: 56908
Speaker 1: Going back to your childhood, what type of child were you?
Speaker 2: I was more of a tomboy.  I, I loved to, to be able to do something, try to do something I wasn't able to do almost, you know.  And shoot marbles, you know one thing to the other.  We had different games or whatever, or the boys tryin' to play football, I'm right in the middle.  So those were the kind of things that I liked to do.
Speaker 1: Were you a precocious child, were you a mischievous child?
Speaker 2: I wasn't very mischievous child, but I had--I would always had what my daddy [Jasper Dolphus] called a smart mouth.  You know sometimes I would say things to--just to aggravate the person, you know.
Speaker 1: Ma'am, were you and your father--it sounds like you know, that there were times that you and your father were at odds.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And the reason, the reason sometimes we were at odds is because my oldest [sic, second oldest] sister Idella had a daughter out of wedlock.  Her daughter name was Estella Glades.  And my mother reared her because my sister was very young.  And so she was in the house.  So my father accepted her more or less as his youngest child over me.  So that was a little bit of a friction in connection with it.  I never forget maybe we go to Sunday school and I would go to my daddy and I'd say well daddy give me--we called him papa, papa give me a penny to go put in church or so.  And he would look at me, "I don't have any pennies."  And so then my niece would go and she would say, rub his head and then she'll say, "Papa give me some money for Sunday school," and he always found a penny or two for her.  So if he gave her two pennies, she gave me one of the two and we went on our merry way.  So those were some of the little things that came up.
Story_ID: 64060
Speaker 1: So you were talking, you were explaining what type of child you were, and your relationship with your father [Jasper Dolphus], how that sometimes that was difficult.  Do you think that might have been--what type of education had he received?
Speaker 2: Well my mother [Sallie Dolphus] and father went to like fourth or fifth grade, you know.  When they came from Georgia down here.  Well you see when they were up in Georgia, very seldom you have a kid going into high school in that particular area.  In fact I don't know whether there was high school available for them even if they wanted it.
Story_ID: 64061
Speaker 1: So your schooling, let's talking about your--start with your elementary school.  Where did you go?  Where did you attend?
Speaker 2: Well the elementary school was right next door to me here.  It was called the Pearl City Elementary School.  And I went to school there like from first grade to around fifth grade.  Then they built what we call the Roadman Elementary School [Pearl City, Boca Raton, Florida], which was right in the middle of Glades Road here.  There was a banyan tree to the south of Glades Row, and there's a banyan tree to the north of Glades Row in the Dixie Manor project [apartments build to house black soldiers and their wives during World War II].  The Roadman Elementary School was between the two, right in the middle of what was Glades Road.  That was a three room schoolhouse.  The original one was just a one room schoolhouse.  So I finished eighth grade there at the Roadman Elementary School in 1942.  Then I went to Carver High School in Delray Beach [Florida] from 1942 to 1946, where I graduated as salutatorian of the class of 1946.
Story_ID: 64062
Speaker 1: Now during your school years, these from elementary school on, do you remember any teachers or any individuals who were mentors or who really made an influence on you during your life, during your time there?
Speaker 2: While at Carver High School [Delray Beach, Florida], Dr. [Clayton L.] Coleman was a very--it was a situation wherein I just wanted to be all that she was.  She majored in math, I wanted to major in math.  I think her minor was chemistry.  I wanted to minor in chemistry, but because I changed schools in college, and I was going to lose some credits, I ended up minoring in physics.  So my major was math, my minor physics.  In high school Dr. Coleman taught chemistry and she taught second year algebra, and, and I attended classes under her.  When we had our day that the students took over the school, I wanted to make sure that I taught in Mrs.--Dr. Coleman's room.  She was the one at that time we had--ring the bell between the change of classes.  And I wanted to ring that bell also.  So anyway, that is--everything that she attempt to do--I changed how I wrote my name.  The 'L' that I was making had a loop at the top and she would write it without one.  I changed immediately to that.  So whatever she did or said, I tried to emulate.
Speaker 1: Were there other teachers?  Were there other--
Speaker 2: Not per se that other than Reverend [Anthony H.] Holliday in math.  I just liked math and he taught me algebra.  And I still have a paper that he--I made like a 94 [percent] on.  And he had a note on there "if you do this again champ, you have to meet Jim."  And his Jim was a, a dog leash that he had cut the end off of and that's what he would give you a lick for, okay.  So I had to be good in math cause I couldn't stand the lick.  So anyway he was very good and I, I like algebra.  And with Jim, it made me get more algebra.
Story_ID: 64063
Speaker 1: So what type of student were you?  Were you active in activities and things at the schools?
Speaker 2: Very few activities because of the fact that I lived here in Pearl City [Boca Raton, Florida] and had to commute up to Delray [Delray Beach, Florida].  And we had no transportation.  So for that reason after school any activities I did participate in softball.  I was on the softball team in high school, I was the catcher.  But other than that, for the most part I was not in too many things because I just couldn't get up there for practice.
Speaker 1: So how difficult was it just getting to and from school?
Speaker 2: There was no problem.  The all, the, the West Palm Beach [Florida], the [Yamato] Colony [community of Japanese farmers organized in 1904] had the buses rollin', so that was no problem getting up there to school.  The problem was that they paid the bus driver so little until you had to go early in the mornin' cause they had a regular job.  And then you'd be a little later in the afternoon.  So we got out of school at 3:15, but the bus didn't come for us until 4:00.  And the teachers would leave and go home, principal and everybody else.  And you had to stay there and fend for yourself between 3:15 and 4:00 until the bus driver came for you.  And the bus driver situation was real strict.  You had no problems like you have today.  I mean the bus driver could stop the bus and put you off anywhere on the eight mile trail.  So for that reason you didn't have no hangin' out the bus and no chewing gum, no eating, none of that on the bus.  You were just stoic.
Story_ID: 64064
Speaker 1: Now what was the community, like that school as a community?  Was it supportive, was it nurturing?
Speaker 2: You mean the community around Carver [High School, Delray Beach, Florida]?
Speaker 1: No, the school itself.  Was it a nurturing place for you?  Did it help you to grow as a person and things of that--what did you learn as a person outside of the classroom experience, as a person at the schools?
Speaker 2: Well you know as I said, commutin' up there, you had very little after school activity that you were involved in.  The teachers were all very good in connection with tryin' to make sure that every child had an education.  And you didn't have to have a problem with people goofing off on your education.  And the teacher word was it.  And the parent--if the teacher said it, the parent didn't question it at all.  The student didn't have anything to say because the teacher said it, and that's it.  So for that reason, the teachers played a very important part in being caring teachers, it meant so much because it each teacher wanted to make sure that every child would develop to their maximum.
Story_ID: 64065
Speaker 1: Now at this time when you're older, you're in high school and you're doing well academically, is the relationship with your father--does he feel that he's not, not only is he not supportive of your education, but do you feel like he's kind of bothered by the fact that you're seeking an education?
Speaker 2: He started coming around because of the fact that I was excelling in school and because of people like Reverend [Anthony H.] Holliday talking with him and others about my ability to do well in school.  And so then he wanted to be that proud father because of the fact that his daughter was doing well in school.
Speaker 1: So you're--the better you did, the better the relationship with your father.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Story_ID: 64066
Speaker 1: Now I do wanna ask you what sights, sounds and smells bring you back to the child you were in Pearl City [Boca Raton, Florida]?
Speaker 2: I don't really understand.
Speaker 1: What sights, sounds or smells make--remind you of your childhood?
Speaker 2: Well in the sound situation is those old mosquitoes.  You see our homes didn't have windows that were made of glass and screens in it.  So you had wooden windows for the most part.  And those mosquitoes in the summer time, it's something, and they buzz and they were there.  Now we used to get the root from a Parramatta [unclear] bush and we would put it in the yard, light it, and then we'd do like the Indians, put a blanket like, a piece of cloth over it and get the smoke rollin' from it [Martin is describing smoke from a Native American tepee fire which can repel, stun, and kill mosquitoes].  And we'd open up the entire house and let the smoke run through the house and then we'd close those wooden windows.  And that's how we were able to survive from those mosquitoes.  So here you are 94, 95 degree temperature with wooden windows.  And then hearing some of the mosquitoes buzzing outside.  But God is good.  He allowed us to be able to survive that and nobody you know, got to the point wherein their health was bad because of it, you know.  We got by.
Speaker 1: Are there any sights or smells that remind you of your childhood?
Speaker 2: The sound in connection with the Atlantic Ocean.  We used to go over to the ocean much more than we do now because they built up everywhere around the Atlantic Ocean now.  So you either gotta pay to see it or, or pass by and look at it and say I used to be there.  But we used to walk over to the Atlantic Ocean and just--we had an area we called 'Jaba [ph.] Rock' where a rock extended out into the ocean.  And the sound of the waves knocking up against those rocks and sometime we'd take conch shells and put it up to our ear and, and listen to the sound what have you, and it was just refreshing to be able to go over there and to be able to fish and, and be in the outdoors.
Story_ID: 64067
Speaker 1: Now the church, the other part of the area, the community in which you were growing up.  Now the church [Ebenezer Missionary Baptist Church, Pearl City, Boca Raton, Florida] you were growing up and attending was founded by your uncle [Rev. J.H. Dolphus].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell us about the church and how important that was to you growing up and to the community in Pearl City [Boca Raton, Florida].
Speaker 2: Ebenezer [Missionary] Baptist Church was organized the third Sunday in November in 1918.  At that time my uncle, Reverend J.H. Dolphus was the--he was the first pastor.  His wife name was Lois Dolphus.  My mother [Sallie Dolphus] named me after her.  She was the one that suggested that the name of the church be called Ebenezer [Hebrew word for 'stone of help'].  The church originally was on Northeast Tenth Street.  It was more or less like a Paramatta [unclear] bush harbor.  It wasn't anything that would keep the rain completely out, but it would slow it up.  So we moved from Northeast 10th Street, the church, from the brush harbor, over to Northeast 11th Street.  We had the church there for a while.  And then some real estate person downtown was gonna give us a piece of property, help us with a piece of property much larger.  So then we moved to Northeast 12th Street where the church is right now.  So that church has meant--in fact these churches mean so much to the community in the first place.  We used to have the, the Macedonia AME [African Methodist Episcopalian] Church, which is three doors east of where I am now, where I live now.  That church was organized before Ebenezer.  And we had just the two churches, the AME, Macedonia AME, and the Ebenezer Missionary Baptist Church.  And we used to go to both churches.  If you asked an individual what church are you a member of?  And you say well I'm Baptist/Methodist.  That means you're a member of the Baptist church but you go to the Methodist church.  If you say Methodist/Baptist, you're a member of the Methodist, you go to the Baptist.  On the first and third Sunday of every month we went to Ebenezer.  The second and fourth Sunday we went to Macedonia.  And everybody just switched.  And you sung the songs the way the AME sang it, and you go to the Baptist and you sing it that way.  So the church meant quite a bit to the entire community because again, the churches at that time did more of what the Bible suggest that we do, and that is be the welfare for the community rather than the state or the county being the welfare.  Whatever a person needed, you just provide it, you know.  You just work together in connection with the churches.  And also the churches had programs and different things that you can do in the church that will keep you out of trouble because you have something to do, you know.  And then they have these great picnics and one thing.  And then the sports part.  You work with the kids, you know, with softball or whatever.  So it meant quite a bit to us.

Speaker 1: How involved were you in the church?  What things did you do, participation in the church?
Speaker 2: I was secretary of Sunday school for a long time at Ebenezer [Missionary Bible Church, Boca Raton, Florida].  And then I was--I taught the adult Bible class in Ebenezer some 40 years.  At this time, I am now the Treasurer of Ebenezer Missionary Baptist Church.  I stopped teaching the adult class because I had worked with younger people and I wanted to turn it over to some of them while I can be a mentor to them and sit in the class and work with them.  So we have a very good teacher, Angie Washington, that is teaching the adult lady Bible class that I have mentored for years and years before I said you're gonna take over and I'll be there for you.
Story_ID: 64069
Speaker 1: But as a child, what types of things did you participate in when you were younger?  When you were a child growing up with your family.  What type of events and activities did the church provide you as a child?
Speaker 2: Well the Baptist church had different activities for different groups, you call the Sunbeam maybe age say five to nine or so.  And then you had the Red Circle that would take over at like 11 to 15.  And so, so they had different age groups in different groups.
Speaker 1: So what types of activities were you involved in as a child at the Ebenezer [Missionary Baptist] Church [Boca Raton, Florida]?
Speaker 2: I went with each group as the age level moved up from the Sunbeam to the Red Circle to the Matrons to the Missionary Society.  And we had books that would go along with each age group and different activities that you can do--
Speaker 1: Plays or anything you did when you were a child, or Easter readings or something?  Okay.
Speaker 2: In the church you had different age group level for different things that you would do.  And our parents made sure that we were in the churches along and then, it was no question of whether you were gonna be there, it's what you're gonna be doing while you are there.  And you had good women working along with the girls, or men with the boys, to teach them, along with just hygiene, you know, different things in connection with how you're growing up and you're accepting the fact that you're goin' into puberty or whatever.  And the church was all.  And we just worked together and, and in the church--say for instance you had to learn the books of the Bible.  And you start Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and you go on through.  You had to learn certain number of Bible verses and tell where it's found.  And we would have contests where the person would give, say like Exodus 6:9 to see who would turn to it the quickest in, in the group and what have you.  So you had quite an extensive life on God and the Bible.  And just learning how to treat other people like you want to be treated.
Story_ID: 64070
Speaker 1: So the Pearl, the Pearl City community [Boca Raton, Florida] between the church, the school and your family, seems very, very strong.  And I wanna know how that either insulated you or whatever it did for you in regards to living in a society that segregation was the law of the land.  How did that prepare you or as a child how did you deal with that when you encountered the segregation?
Speaker 2: Knowing what the Bible says help you to be able to endure the segregation.  Because you knew that somewhere down the line things were gonna turn around.  Plus the fact that we knew that God was in charge and he wasn't gonna let us be down there all the time.  So we prepared ourselves for it.  But you accepted segregation.  It was, it was the land, law of the land.  And so you accepted it.  But you accepted it with reservation.  And as you were able to say something and not get punished or whatever for it, the younger group started, you know, coming out, saying things or trying to change things for the better for the community.
Story_ID: 64071
Speaker 1: Do you have any specific stories or instances where you had face-to-face situations of segregation, society here in Boca [Boca Raton, Florida] as a child or Pearl City [Boca Raton, Florida]?
Speaker 2: During the time when [Police] Chief [Hugh] 'Brownie'[Brown] they call it, was the [police] chief of Pearl [City], of Boca Raton.  He was the chief for many, many years.  They were looking for a black man that had a rifle or whatever.  Anyway, he ran across my brother hunting I guess about eight miles from here out in the woods and he had a rifle.  He didn't ask him any questions.  He just beat him to a pulp almost.  And then finally he came up and he said, "Who--what is your name?"  And he told them the name.  "So why you didn't tell me that before?  Cause I know you're Jasper's [Dolphus] son."  He said "You never asked me or gave me a chance to say anything."  So he brought him home.  And he said--didn't say I'm sorry, but he said, "I brought your son in and if he had spoke out earlier, he wouldn't be in the shape he's in."  And I looked at the situation and I said, "You know, one day you're going to have to reap what you sow."  And my mother [Sallie Dolphus] says, "Don't say anything," you know, cause she was afraid because he was the [police] chief.  But I told him, I said and my mother said go, go, go, get back out of here, whatever.  So anyway that was one situation.  I had a situation happen to me down in Fort Lauderdale [Florida].  I went down to shop at Fort Lauderdale; that was one of the places we used to go to shop, Fort Lauderdale or West Palm Beach [Florida] cause you didn't have any stores, dress stores or what have you, around here [Pearl City].  And I was in the ten cent store there and I had to go to the bathroom.  And I looked up, white only, women, white only.  I walked right in.  So one of the cashiers run in behind me.  She says, "You can't come in here."  I said, "Wait till I finish."  So when I finished, I came out, she had gone out and she had gotten the manager and he came to the door.  And he said--was at the door when I came out.  He said to me, "Can't you read?"  I said, "Read, read what?"  He says, "That sign up there says 'white women only.'"  I said, "I didn't know we had any white women in these United States.  I see some of you look a little flush in the face, but it's not white."  So anyway the other girl was with me say, "Hey, you know, don't push it now."  So anyway he told the lady, say, "Well she's out already so we can't do anything about it."  So he says, "Get on out the store," so I left.  But I got time for the most part.  There was a parking lot to the north of that dime store where we used to park the old car if we came in a car.  And usually if you had to go to the bathroom, just go around the side of one of those cars in the parking lot, you know.  But that particular time I decided that I'm going to go right in here, and I did.
Story_ID: 64072
Speaker 1: Now where did you get the personality you think?  Where do you think you received that personality to--like when the police chief [Hugh 'Brownie' Brown] comes in and you make that statement to him.  That could have been everybody in the house getting' taken away.
Speaker 2: Again--
Speaker 1: Where do you think that came from?
Speaker 2: Well my civics classes and the rules that they had for the white man I felt like was the same rules was good for me.  And for that reason you know, I mean I have some rights.  And you violated the rights of my brother and everything else.  Now--and you, you still don't wanna say I'm sorry, you know.  And I just want you to know.  And form what I had been taught in the Bible and in school, you're gonna reap what you sow.  And he [Hugh 'Brownie' Brown] did.  Cause during the time that the Army airbase was out here, one of the black ladies, her name was Mattie Parker, he beat up Mattie Parker.  And the soldiers beat him to a pulp almost.  Rode around in the car, brought the car and parked it on the side of him in the road.  Then called and told them to come and get him and carry him to the doctor or hospital.  So anyway after that, they had--because it was soldiers involved in it, it was a little bit different.  They tried it a little differently and he had to take this lady to the doctor after that.  He cuss her halfway there, but anyway he had to pay for it and take her to the doctor that he had beat up.  But again, you know--
Story_ID: 64073
Speaker 1: What was your parents' [Sallie and Jasper Dolphus] reactions to what was going on?  What did they tell you how to respond to the possibility that anything could happen at any time because of what was going on.
Speaker 2: Says, "It's better, it's better to just close your mouth and live with it than to open your mouth and then be bruised."  That's what they would say.  And as I said, every now and then one of us would just say what we wanna say.  Whether we get bruised or not, you know.
Story_ID: 64074
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now we're--your end of the high school [Carver High School, Delray Beach, Florida] and you're--tell us about your trek to the salutatorianship.
Speaker 2: Along and then you know, very few of us had encyclopedias at home.  And so you had to go to a library and we didn't have a library around here in Boca Raton [Florida] to go to in the first place.  But the Lord will provide.  That same lady that we were doing the washing for, for three dollars, had some encyclopedias and some books and all.  And she in turn allowed me to use those books that were outdated you know, but still with enough information in it that I could use it to do certain things.  So I did.  And again, I tell children sometime you know, sometime you have to eat cheese to get what you want, just don't let it constipate you.
Story_ID: 56924
Speaker 1: I want to let you, let you tell the story we started, start talking.  How did your parents [Sallie and Jasper Dolphus] discipline you if they saw you attempting to stand up even though they wouldn't?
Speaker 2: Well I had a situation, I had an uncle came from Georgia down and he was living at the house with my parents and us.  And the police came to the house looking for him.  Someone had said that he had done whatever was done wrong somewhere, and they said it was he and they came to the house.  Well my uncle wasn't at home.  But the police knocked and pushed the door open at the same time and just came right in.  And so I told him, I said, "Well will you please step back outside?"  My mother said, "Wait a minute, wait that's the police."  I said, "I don't care who it is.  He didn't--did you see a person commit a crime and run in here?  If not, you can't come in my house that way."  And so anyway my mother says, "No, no, no."  And I just, you know, pushed myself to the front and so he looked at me and he says "Well I tell you what, you niggers gettin' an education, you reading too much, that's why you don't need to have a book to read out of in the first place.  Tell your uncle, tell your brother to come down to the police station in the morning by 9:00."  So my uncle did go down there.  But and then he told him, he said "Well you be, better be glad I didn't catch you last night.  I caught the person that I was lookin' for 'cause I would have reddened your head."  So that was the situation.
Speaker 1: And did your mother rebuke you for--
Speaker 2: Yes she did, yes she did.  She got on me and plus the fact that she said that I had no reason to say what I had to say.  I say, "Mama, but it is in the book.  It's--we have a right--he wasn't supposed to just run into your house like that."  She said, "I know that.  But what can we do about it?"  I said, "I can do what I did last night, at least say something."  But she punished me for it.
Speaker 1: And how did that make you feel?  Being punished for something you know that you did right?
Speaker 2: I didn't mind it after I'd gotten my words out.  I was one person, once I got my words out, if I got punished for it, I didn't mind it afterwards, okay.
Story_ID: 56925
Speaker 1: So now you're salutatorian.  You were telling us the story of the encyclopedias were given to you by the people you did ironing and washing for.  How did these help you in your--become salutatorian?
Speaker 2: Well there were term, term papers that you had to do.  And because I could not do the major part of the work at the school [Carver High School, Delray Beach, Florida], then the encyclopedia was a big help in helping me to research what I had to write upon.  Plus it was good to have something extra that you can just read and study and, and get some insight on different things because the books--you didn't have any books.  And there were times when you had to share books.  I'd bring home the book today and someone else bring it home tomorrow or whatever.  So for that reason, it, it helped quite a bit.
Speaker 1: So when you become salutatorian, how proud are your parents?
Speaker 2: My mother [Sallie Dolphus] was--she was really excited about it.  And Reverend [Anthony H.] Holiday suggested that they try to get me into college and again my father [Jasper Dolphus] says I don't mind her going to college, but I just don't have any money to see her get into college.
Story_ID: 56926
Speaker 1: Now how much was it for you to go to Florida Normal [College]?
Speaker 2: Florida Normal College [St. Augustine, Florida, now Florida Memorial University, Miami, Florida] is the first college I went to, which is a Baptist school.  It was at that time in St. Augustine, Florida.  It is now located in Miami.  It's called Florida Memorial in Miami.
Speaker 1: And how much did it cost for you to attend?
Speaker 2: It was around $68 dollars to get in.  And we had to pay $35 a month for room and board to go there.  So what I did, I got a job working in the dining hall for $20 a month, and I got one working in the dormitory for $15 a month.  And so that paid my board.
Speaker 1: Now your choice of majors while you're there is--
Speaker 2: I majored in math and my minor was physics.  At Florida Normal, it was a Baptist school and they didn't have as many top notch math classes at Florida Normal as at Florida A&M [Agricultural and Mechanical].  So I only did two years at Florida Normal and I got a A.A. [Associates of Arts] from Florida Normal.  When I decided to go from Florida Normal to Florida A&M, the dean of the college, Dr. (Cardale?) said that we can't have any of our good students leaving the school going to another school and we wanna keep you here and he almost wanted to freeze my record to try to keep me there.  But anyway I prevailed and I gave him a reason that I just wanted to take more math than was there.  And after I got all my transcripts sent to Florida A&M, then I told him some of the other things, my reason for wanting to leave there.  So I ended up in 1948 going to Florida A&M, and I lost a few credits by changing schools, so I had to go to summer school one summer to make up for some of those credits, but I finished on time in, in 1950.
Speaker 1: Now backing up a little bit, what made you choose Florida Normal to begin with?  Why did you choose?
Speaker 2: I chose Florida Normal because of the pastor of the church, Reverend Kitchen was the pastor of the church at the time and he said that they would give me scholarships if I would go to Florida Normal, he can get me a scholarship.  And I went to Florida Normal and they ended up giving me a scholarship for thirty dollars.
Speaker 1: Was that enough?
Speaker 2: Not even to get paid one month.  But that was what he said, he said I was gonna get a scholarship.  But it was only thirty dollars.
Story_ID: 56927
Speaker 1: What was your experience like while you were at Florida Normal [College, St. Augustine, Florida, now Florida Memorial University in Miami, Florida]]?
Speaker 2: It was rough.  Well Florida Normal was so strict that I just--I was glad I was workin' two jobs because I can see them puttin' me out of school.  I mean you couldn't do any--you had to go to prayer meeting, you had to--as a freshman you had to come downstairs in the living room and, and sit there and wait.  And you had to have somebody chaperone you over to the church to go to prayer meeting and come back and one thing to the other.  The library--you had to sign out in the dormitory to go to the library, sign in at the library, sign out of the library comin' back.  And back in the dormitory, and it's right next door to the dormitory, okay.  So I signed out of the dormitory, say at 6:00 going to the library.  I get to the library, someone else had signed in 6:10.  It's not supposed to be but five minutes between you and the library.  So I can't sign 6:05 below the person with 6:10.  So because of that, I'm gonna be punished.  So when they checked those books and find a discrepancy like that, then you were punished because they figure you used some extra time goin' from Point A to Point B.  And they were very, very strict.  One Saturday they were havin' what they call 'Pool Party.'  And they had some hot dogs and hamburgers and what have you out there by the pool.  And I was on my way to the dining hall and I passed by the party on the grass, and someone stopped me and I chatted with them.  I said okay, the person had missed a class and wanted to know if I had any information as to what was needed for him to catch up on the class or something.  Anyway it was like a two-minute conversation.  But the dean of the dormitory saw me in those two minutes.  I went on to the dining hall, worked, came back.  I'm put on restriction for two weeks because I went to the party and didn't sign out.  I didn't go to the party.  I passed by the party going to the dining hall.  So it was strict, it was just unbelievable.  I also wanted to take architecture drawing.  And the architecture drawing class was on the side where the men dormitory is because only male took the class.  So I got into the class not for credit, but went to the class, doin' fine.  Someone told the dean that I was taking the class and that I was going over there with the men folk in this class.  And so they took me out of class and I was punished again for going to a class with all male in it.  And I thank God that I did get a chance to go into that class because this home that I have here now, I was able to do drawin' for this particular home.  And all I had to do was find me a, a licensed architect and have them seal it and put the plumbing and electric line on it.  But everything else I had in place on here but the plumbing and electric line, I didn't have that kind of information as to what the City of Boca Raton wanted in connection with it.  So I found a Christian fellow to just charge me seventy-five dollars to put that on and seal it.  And that came from that particular class that I had.  I have a number of plans in the City of Boca Raton when I first came out of college, they would accept additions for homes and all that I would draw.  They would accept it down at the city hall.  But then later they decided that if the addition was over $10,000 it had to be sealed by a licensed architect.  So then with the cost of materials going up, whatever was done was over $10,000, so that put me out of business.
Story_ID: 56928
Speaker 1: So you get to the point where you realize Florida Normal [College, St. Augustine, Florida, now Florida Memorial University in Miami, Florida] is not for you.  What brings you to the choice of Florida Agricultural [&] Mechanical University?
Speaker 2: Well at that time, that was the only other Florida school that you can go to other than Bethune-Cookman College [now Bethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach, Florida] and Bethune-Cookman College was too expensive.  And Florida A&M was a state school.  So it really was less than Florida Normal because of the fact that they only gave me this little thirty dollar scholarship.  So I had no other choice and I didn't have enough money go out of state.
Story_ID: 56929
Speaker 1: So how were your grades while you were at Florida Normal [College in St. Augustine, Florida, now Florida Memorial University in Miami, Florida]?
Speaker 2: Florida Normal, I--the dean [Dr. Cardale?] there also told me, he had me in for an interview.  And he asked me about my siblings and how far they went in school.  So I told them I had one sister go to eleventh grade and drop out, and I had a brother to go to tenth grade and drop out, and all the rest of them dropped out in the elementary school.  So none of them finished high school.  So then from that information, he's gonna come to the conclusion that I could not major in math because math is one of those subjects that you gotta be really ready for and in that my siblings didn't go, finish high school, that I didn't have the ability to do math.  So I told him, "I'm gonna show you something.  I'm gonna major in math and I'm gonna be on the Dean's list."  I said "And I want to see you when you come up on the stage to shake my hand for making the Dean's list."  So I did well and then afterwards he didn't want me to leave.
Story_ID: 56930
Speaker 1: So what is your experience like when you get to Florida Agricultural & Mechanical University?
Speaker 2: Well it was a much bigger school.  I still needed to work because my parents were not able to pay full board.  So I got in the line where you were signing up for jobs.  So when I got into the office, the gentleman's office, he said to me that, "Where's your application?"  I said, "Well--." He said, "I don't see an application here for you."  I said, "I didn't turn in one.  I got one here in my hand."  He said, "Well I must take care of those persons that have already turned in applications first, and then I can take care of you afterwards."  I said, "No."  I said, "The reason I didn't turn in the application because I have no other choice.  Either you're gonna give me a job or you're gonna send me back home, period.  I cannot stay here unless I have a job."  So I didn't have to worry about an application.  He says, "Well I have other people in line, I'm gonna get them" and this, that and the other.  I said, "I'm not leaving out of here because I must have a job."  I said, "And by the way, the job must pay $44.50"--that's what the board was.  I said, "It has to pay all of my board 'cause I can't get a nickel for board from home."  So anyway we had it in there for 15, 20 minutes.  He said, "You know you're the most determined young lady I've seen in my life."  He said, "I tell you what, take this note, take it over to the dining hall, give it to Mrs. Hatcher and tell her I say put you to work tomorrow.  And it pays 44.50 a month."  So I started working in the dining hall at Florida A&M for forty dollars and fifty cent a month, which was the amount of the board.  On the other hand, for some reason the dietician just didn't--I don't know why--she just didn't like me and I had done no wrong or said anything.  So she tried to make me fire myself.  So she put me on a job down in what we called the 'trayville room,' where the trays were put on like an elevator downstairs where you wash the dishes and all.  And usually just the young men worked down there because they got on boots and it's sloppy and everything else down there with the dishwashers and washin' and all.  So anyway she sent me--had me to go down there.  So I said, "No problem."  I said, "This is the only job they told me I can get 44.50, so you can't fire me."  So I went down, I washed dishes.  I stayed down there for about two weeks.  She came down one day and she told me to come upstairs and she had me to go into her office and she had one of the dresses that the girls out front wore that were checking the meal tickets.  You had to clip the meal tickets when the person come through the line, you know.  So she said to me, she says, "Put that dress on and come back out here."  I did.  She says, "I want you to go up there on the right side and tell the young lady there that I said come back here.  I want you to begin working right there."  So I worked upstairs clippin' tickets from then on.  But again, it's just determination.  And as I said with my background in religion, I believe that all things are possible with God.  And if I just do what I am supposed to do, he'll take care of the rest, and he did.
Story_ID: 56931
Speaker 1: Now as a woman.  Now as a woman, I have to bring that up.  As a woman majoring in math, which is not the common for females to major in, especially back then, what brought you to wanting to major in the math field?
Speaker 2: Again, Dr. [Clayton L.] Coleman [Martin's math and chemistry teacher at Carver High School] major was math.  And if her major was math, mine just had to be math.
Speaker 1: Did you find it to be challenging?  Did you--
Speaker 2: It was challenging, but not to a very high degree because between Dr. Coleman and Dr. [Rev. Anthony H.] Holliday [Martin's high school algebra teacher], I had a good foundation.
Speaker 1: So how many women, other females, were in those classes with you, your math classes?
Speaker 2: There were at Florida A&M [Agricultural & Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], there were four of us young ladies that finished as math majors in the class of 1950.  One of them live in California, one in Quincy, Florida, one is dead and I'm here in Boca Raton.  About three months ago the one from California was over here to visit me for a couple of weeks.  We still in contact with each other, but there were only four of us that stuck it out to the end because it was quite challenging.
Speaker 1: Now were there challenges because did, did you feel any friction from the professors or from the male students, or--
Speaker 2: More from the male students than from the teachers because the head of the math department at that time was a lady at Florida A&M, Dr. Clark was the head of the math department, so it was more from the male students than from teaching.
Speaker 1: And how well did you do while you were at FAMU [Florida Agricultural & Mechanical University]?
Speaker 2: I, I didn't end up having that cord around my neck, but I did well.
Story_ID: 56932
Speaker 1: So you graduate, you're about to graduate FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University], and where are you looking toward, what direction are you looking toward now to go into?  What field or--
Speaker 2: Well I majored in math and at that particular time, blacks for the most part it was either teaching school or a preacher or whatever.  So for the most part people went to school, they majored in education.  So I'm looking for a teaching job.  So there was a job open up in Quincy, Florida.  So I wanted to be near Florida A&M, so I can go to all the football games.  So I decided that I'm gonna go take the job at Quincy.  So I went over and filled out application and everything.  And they accepted me to teach in Quincy, Florida.  I had gone to summer school [at Boston College, Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts] that summer, and an opening came up at Carver High School in Delray Beach [Florida].  Professor [Solomon David] Spady was going to retire and Reverend [Anthony H.] Holliday was going to become the principal of Carver, and so they're gonna need a math teacher.  So the word got to me concerning that particular opening.  So I got out of the contract up at Quincy and was able to accept the offer at Carver in Delray Beach.  So in '50 [1950] when I finished, I came right back to the high school I'd just graduated from four years prior to that time.
Story_ID: 56933
Speaker 1: Now you spent some time in Boston [Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Well I went to a, a--I took graduate, some graduate work at Boston College [Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts] two summers, two summers of graduate work at Boston College.
Speaker 1: And how, how was that?  How, how did you--
Speaker 2: It was, it was very good but again, that was at the time when we were branching out into this new math and all of that and they were gung-ho on the new math and the new math.  And, and I didn't like what was happening you know in the new math field and so forth.  And so for that reason, I didn't push it too much.  Plus the fact that I had married at this time too.
Speaker 1: Now what was it like socially?  'Cause this your first time up north.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What's it like--do you see any social differences between being in the south almost all your life and then being in New England?
Speaker 2: Well the first year I went up there, I was on the campus and there was very little being done on the campus in the summer school.  And the subjects I was taking required so much work until I didn't have time to think about social life or anything.  There was one--the second year I went up there, there was a young man from Alabama I was--second time I went up, I was living in Montgomery, Alabama and I went over there to school.  And so the two of us sometime maybe a Sunday afternoon we just ride around in Boston and get lost and find a police to find--show us the way back or whatever.  But as far as social life, I didn't have any social life while I was doing graduate work.
Story_ID: 56934
Speaker 1: So you come back to Carver [High School, Delray Beach, Florida] and how are you accepted coming back to where you went to school and--
Speaker 2: I was accepted because of the fact that again, I was salutatorian in the graduating class of 1946.  So you, you have someone that you know at least excel up to that point, coming back.  So I was accepted and Mrs. Addie Hudson (ph.) started teaching school the same year.  She had graduated from school two years prior to when I graduated, however she had not gotten a job.  So the two of us became very good friends and we started at the same time so I had--we just were together quite frequently, you know.
Speaker 1: Now what's it like?  'Cause you were a very young lady, you were 21 or 22?
Speaker 2: When I finished, I was 20, 21 soon as I started teaching school.
Speaker 1: Now how is it as a young teacher and you're in a class with these kids, what's it like?
Speaker 2: Well you see the difference at that time the teacher word, the teacher word was all of it.  So you didn't have too much of a problem with the children because all you had to do was go to the parent and the parent was behind you in terms of teaching.  And I have always been a person that I taught every day as if my son [Edward Martin] was sittin' in the classroom.  I wanted to get as much out of a student as I could get out of them.  And you know that because I taught you.  And I would work it.  And I also taught your brother James and I took James under my wings.  I wanted to give him so much math that I accepted him as my student teacher, student teacher.  He would come in an extra hour to maybe help me with some work in my room.  But instead of helping me, I was teaching him a second time because I wanted to give him as much as I could in math.
Speaker 1: Amen.  And with you as a young teacher, were you living back at home or were you at your own place?  Did you live--
Speaker 2: I was living at my mother's [Sallie Dolphus] house right on 12th Street [Pearl City, Boca Raton, Florida].  I'm living now on 11th Street.  But I was with my mother from 1950 to 1959 I was there at the old home house with my mother.  In 1959 is when I got married.
Story_ID: 56935
Speaker 1: And now at this time The Civil Rights Movement is picking up. Brown versus School Board of Education [1954] occurs in this area, in this era.  How does that affect you and the black schools that exist at the time which you're teaching?
Speaker 2: Well at this time you know, there was very little change in anything in 1950 when I first started teaching school.  It was up there around '65 [1965] you know when things started changing.  When I first started teaching school, all the teachers had to go to West Palm Beach [Florida] and spend a week up there with different people coming in discussing things with them as to about the buses and what you can do with the children and the bus situation.  And the dieticians come in and what have you.  You had a whole week up there.  But it was divided then, the blacks had theirs at Roosevelt High School [the second high school built for blacks in Palm Beach County, Florida] in West Palm Beach, and the whites had theirs at one of the white high schools there in, in West Palm Beach.  And they gave us different books to look over and to decide maybe in connection with the books, what our goals and objectives and this and that would be for--
Story_ID: 56936
Speaker 1: So speaking on the inequity of schools.  As a teacher in this time of early '50s [1950s], you could see, you had a firsthand view of how the Caucasian students received education since you interacted with some of the Caucasian teachers sometimes and what your students [at Carver High School, Delray Beach, Florida] were receiving.  Could you speak to that?
Speaker 2: Well really I had very little interaction with the white teachers because when we went to West Palm Beach [Florida] to do our work, we were all separated.  So the only ones that you came in contact with was someone that was in the county office that would come by to give you some information about what to do or not do.
Speaker 1: But were, was there an awareness among the black teachers that your students weren't receiving the same types of books and other--
Speaker 2: Yes, definitely, because of the fact that all you had to do was look at the books you have and they weren't new.  So you knew that they were coming from somewhere else, that someone else had used them first.  We were still trying to split the atom when the atom was split (blurb about books in b v. w schools).  Our science book had not come up to date, you know.  So the situation came around and people like Mr. [C. Spencer] Pompey [Pompey (1915-2001) was a coach, social studies teacher and eventually, the principal of Carver High School in Delray Beach, Florida. His story of desegregation in Palm Beach County 'More Rivers to Cross' was published posthumously in 2003]. working on equality of teachers in the county.  And that's when we came up with this lawsuit with Thurgood Marshall [Marshall (1908-1993) fought for the equal pay of teachers as the chief counsel of the NAACP. He is remembered for winning 29 of 32 cases argued before The Supreme Court of the United States including 'Brown v. Board of Education' (1954). In 1967, he became the first African American Supreme Court Justice] and all in connection within it and with him [C. Spencer Pomepey] and Thurgood Marshall and some of the others, that's how we got to the point wherein we were getting equal pay.  Because we were--the white teachers and the black teachers weren't given the same pay for the same number of years or anything at that time.  And I--
Speaker 1: What was the difference in pay between you and--
Speaker 2: Mr. Pompey had filing out--Thurgood got a copy of the pay scale for blacks and the pay scale for whites and we were just different.  My first year out in 1950, I was getting two thousand dollars a year.  So that was on sixty-six dollars and sixty-six cent a month that I was getting paid for teaching school in 1950.
Speaker 1: And that was much less than what your--
Speaker 2: And the whites at that particular time, maybe were getting like three thousand dollars instead of two thousand dollars.
Speaker 1: So what happened with the lawsuit?
Speaker 2: The lawsuit was won and the pay scale was changed.  And so we knew we were able to, with a lawyer, get the proper information and all at all times to make sure that we were getting paid the same things as the whites were getting paid.
Story_ID: 56937
Speaker 1: So the black students that you were teaching at the high school, how important is it that the reality of the situation that you know that these students are gonna go into?  How does that affect the methods in which you prepare them and the other black teachers at the school prepare these students for the segregated society that they're gonna have to go into at the time?
Speaker 2: We prepared them for the segregated society, but we told them it's not gonna last always.  We gotta look forward to it stopping.  So we gotta be ready to move in when the--when it's presented to us that we can go here or there or whatever, we need to be ready.  So we're gonna do the best we can with you and teach you as much as we can so that when the opportunity comes, then you'll be ready.  It, it's similar to say for instance when I was in high school and kids were tellin' me I wonder why you study that hard and you do this, that and the other?  Your parents are, are poor and they're not gonna send you to college.  You aren't gonna be able to go to college.  Why are you studying like this?  I said I don't know that.  The opportunity might present itself that I can go to college and I wanna be ready if it does.  And the same thing we use in connection with you and the rest of our students that you know, be ready.  It's comin', we just don't know when.
Speaker 1: So at this time when the Civil Rights Movement is really picking up, are you encouraging the students to participate in any protests, marches or anything of that sort?
Speaker 2: No I, I really didn't.  I didn't know--think that the marches, the kind that we could do at the time, would be of any benefit.  But do what you're supposed to do.  Have the education and be ready.
Story_ID: 56938
Speaker 1: Now tell us when the, the shift happens when you actually begin teaching at an integrated school, and how that comes about.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I taught at Carver High School (Delray Beach, Florida) from 1950 to 1958.  That school then became Spady Elementary School and we moved from there over to where Carver Middle School is now in 1958.  I taught then over there it was high school, nine through twelve.  I taught from 1958 to 1965.  In 1965 I went to Montgomery, Alabama with my husband [Edward Martin].  He wanted to con--finish up his training at the college there, finish up there.  He had done a year there, so we went up to Montgomery, Alabama in 1965.  I stayed in Montgomery, Alabama from 1965 to 1970.  Between this time is when integration was. And I saw it firsthand at the Booker T. Washington High School in Montgomery, Alabama.  They decided that they were going to have two lady teachers, white, come to Booker T. Washington High School and teach a year.  They get extra money, and they were going to give them a chance to after that year, move them to whatever high school they wanted to, if they didn't want to remain at Booker Washington High School.  Before they moved them over there, we did not have any teachers' lounge or any teachers' bathrooms.  The ladies went to the girls' bathroom, the men went to the boys' bathroom and that was it.  But to bring in these two white teachers, then we gotta have a lounge.  So then they proceeded to fix a lounge for the ladies, because it was two ladies comin' in.  And say well we'll fix a lounge for the men too, maybe we get a man next year.
Story_ID: 56939
Speaker 1: So anyway those two teachers were brought in and one day one of the teachers asked me if I was going to the office, and I said, "Yeah."  She said, "Well will you carry my requisition to Mr. [Theodore] Smiley," which was the principal of Booker Washington High School at the time.  So I looked at her requisition.  I said I never heard of this before she came here.  I didn't know you could write out a requisition.  So I took her requisition and I went into a little room and I wrote down off of her requisition everything she had on her requisition and the prices and all of that.  Then I carried the requisition to the principal and I gave it to him and I asked him if I can have an app-a paper so that I can fill out my requisition.  So he handed me one.  And I filled it out with what she had on hers because I didn't have no books.  I didn't know you could even--in fact we had never done a requisition before.  Out of the three years I'd been there, Booker Washington.  All you accepted was whatever the principal gave you.  If he gave you some paper or whatever, you accepted that and that was it.  So the principal got mad with me.  I said, "Well how come you gonna accept that white lady's requisition and then not wanna accept mine?  Why didn't you as soon as she came in here and can fill out a requisition, why didn't you call us together and tell us you all can fill out a requisition too?"  I said, "That's unfair."  He said, "Well don't spread this word."  So anyway I got my material.  Before then we had to buy our own pencil sharpener from Sears and what have you.  Now in our classrooms we had heavy duty stuff because the federal government bought it.  I had an eraser cleaner in my room.  I had overhead projector, I had 15mm projector.  Anything expensive I had, but I didn't have any chalk, no paper, no pencil sharpener.  You had to buy that on--another thing, when you went over to his office you were going to run off a test or something, you go over, you had to show him your stencil that you bought, that you had typed on, that you had made out.  And tell him how many in your class.  And he could take a ream of paper and when he got through giving your portion that you say you need, you would have maybe ten extra sheets.  And that's how you got your paper.  There were army airbase [Maxwell Air Force Base] near where our school was.  And so the federal government paid them extra money for the children of any of the soldiers on their base coming to the school.  So they got extra money for all of that, but we didn't see it in connection with our requisition.  In fact, I never knew that there was such a word in connection with things there.  So you can see what happened just by bringing in two whites.  We got a bathroom and a lounge for the ladies after three years I had been there.
Story_ID: 56940
Speaker 1: How was life different in Alabama for you?  Just you and your husband [Edward Martin].  How was it different there than it was here [Pearl City, Boca Raton, Florida]?
Speaker 2: Well I, I, I mean I love to go to church.  And at this time, my husband then was a minister.  So it was very good because there was so many churches in the area and the outlying area, that you had something you could be going to, a revival or something, all the time.  So I really--I mean I just loved living in Montgomery, Alabama.  Another thing--reason I loved living there was the fact that during the time when [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] was there and all, the people decided that we're going to have everything that they [whites] have so that we can give our people a choice of whether they want to come to mine like theirs.  And not a situation wherein they have something and we don't have it.  So we had big clinics with blacks runnin' the whole clinic and anything we wanted.  So for that reason when you went downtown, you were treated royally because they knew anything you were buying from them you can buy it from the blacks.  So they were just, you know, you gotta treat me fair.  So it was a, you know, a good situation.  I, I mean I loved living in Montgomery, Alabama.
Story_ID: 56941
Speaker 1: So you were there on April 4th, 1968 [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated by James Earl Ray at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And how was that day?
Speaker 2: Well actually speaking, it was a--I, I didn't get all into the streets or around many people at that particular time.  It was a situation wherein kind of feelin' the way out in connection with it.
Speaker 1: How did you hear about it?
Speaker 2: On the news.
Speaker 1: How did you feel?
Speaker 2: Well I said, "Father God I know it was comin', but I just didn't know it was comin' right now.  And just prepare me to be able to just slide right into this and do whatever you want me to do."
Speaker 1: And how was the rest--how was it when you went back to school [Booker T. Washington High School, Montgomery, Alabama] after?
Speaker 2: You mean what school?
Speaker 1: You were teaching.
Speaker 2: The kids in the schools, I mean you know it was--nothing had happened other than the word was out.
Speaker 1: Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was--
Speaker 2: You know, so that you can do this or it's going to happen.  You're going to have to integrate the schools and, and all of that you know.  So anyway--
Story_ID: 56942
Speaker 1: So moving on in your education, field of education, your first time you're teaching Caucasian students.  Where and when does that happen?
Speaker 2: That happened at Carver High School in Delray Beach [Florida] in 1970.
Speaker 1: And explain that experience.
Speaker 2: Well really it, it, it was a good experience, but I didn't think too much of it.  It was just like another child in the classroom as far as I was concerned.  And I was going to treat that child just like I would any other child.  And I was going to try to be the best I can for that person.  In fact, I used to stay a half an hour before school and a half an hour after school for anybody want extra help.  And most of the time they were whites that stayed before or after for extra help.  So I mean I could move right in just like it had always been happening.
Speaker 1: And did you see any differences in how the school itself changed or how the school became different with an integrated school population?
Speaker 2: Well you see the problem was that they still tryin' to feel their way out.  And they don't wanna do it in a hurry for fear it might go backwards or whatever.  So at one time we had even a shuttle bus system from Carver over to Atlantic High School [Delray Beach, Florida].  Kids were out there half a day at Carver and half a day over at the other school and all those kind of transitions, you know.  But on the other hand, the students helped us older people move into it much better because of the fact that they just you know, say well this is it.  This is the way it supposed to been in the first place.  And they had never lived under some of the harsh treatments and one thing to the other one that we had.  So it was all right.
Speaker 1: How was interacting with the parents of the Caucasian students?
Speaker 2: The parents for the most part it was all right.  Prior to integration, like when I first started teaching school, every teacher had to visit every parent--every student house.  And had to write up a report of that visiting at home.  So you can see with integration, that's eliminated okay.  And so you accept it, you know, what I was saying.  The parents--as long as you can produce and a parent can see in the work that the child is bringing home and what work the child is doing and, and all, they can accept it because of the fact that it's nothing different.
Story_ID: 56943
Speaker 1: And your experiences with it.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: With the teachers and having an integrated staff and everything like that.  Do you think that was a more positive situation than it was when it was the separate situation?
Speaker 2: It was.  But on the other hand, some of the teachers thought that they too were a little bit better than some of us.  And you had problems there sometimes in connection with them.  Or you might have had someone that was over you that was not quail--that was under qualified and you're overqualified and they're over you.  And so you have friction sometimes.  I give you an example.  They hired a lady--they gave her a title and she had to check the lesson plans of the teachers and make a report and whatever.  So when she came to Carver, she said to me, she says, "I don't know any math.  And I need your help.  I want you to teach me how to check the lesson plans and all, and what's needed and something about the goals and all of this."  So I did, I taught her.  The next year I turned in a lesson plan to her.  She had all these red marks on there.  So I went to her and I had quadratic equation on there.  I said, "What equation is this?"  She said, "You know I don't know any math, I don't know what that is."  I said, "And how did you put these red marks out here on my paper?"  She said, "Well I had to show some indication that I at least checked it."  I said, "But you didn't check it, you just put some red marks down."  I said, "Now I tell you what.  You find yourself some whiteout and get every red mark out of my lesson plan book.  Then turn it back to me."  I said, "And the next person you hear from will be the principal."  I went to the principal.  I said, "Well I, I said I didn't know what was coming up," I said, "but the Lord prepared me for this."  I said, "I have individualized my textbook that I'm using.  And because the kids are gonna be on all kind of levels, I cannot do lesson plans.  I can give you my scope what I'm doing.  I can give you the booklet of where they're going next and everything else and all of that.  But just a lesson plan for this week I can't do it."  I said, "And I thank God that I have it all ready and here it is.  And I will not be doing anymore lesson plan."  And that's when I stopped doing lesson plan because of those red marks in my lesson plan book.  And she didn't know anything about quadratic formula that she was markin' up.
Speaker 1: So you had more difficulties dealing with white staff members than with children.
Speaker 2: Children, no problem.
Story_ID: 56944
Speaker 1: Now during this whole time when you're teaching, you're still active in other areas of the city, not just as a teacher.  You--I mean your church and parks and recreation and other things.  Talk about those services.
Speaker 2: Well at first I was on--Parks and Recreation Advisory Board [Boca Raton, Florida].  I was the secretary there.  Dr., Mr. Rockeford [unclear] was on--had an office on A1A [Florida state road], and that's where we met.  And we would help decide on where parks are gonna be put and something concerning what is gonna be at this particular park, whether it's gonna be a passive park or what have you.  So I worked with that group for, for some time.  Then let's see.  I left from Park and Recreation--I think I have a paper here.  That was in 1971 to 1973 when I worked with Parks and Recreation.  In 1978, I became the vice chairman of Boca Raton Housing Authority.  Now how I got there, I had worked on Housing Advisory Board.  The federal government decided that Boca [Boca Raton, Florida] had to have an affordable housing plan, which Boca didn't want to do because the Boca Raton Housing Authority is an autonomous body and they couldn't push us around.  We had an advisory board, and that's what it was because we had to go back to them and they made the common analysis, they had to decide whether it was gonna be or not.  So they finally decided if we're gonna keep this money that the federal government is giving us, we gotta come up with this housing authority.  So then we had the Housing Authority.  I was vice chairman, Norman Wymbs was the chairman, and you could be on the board for two terms of four year each, so I stayed on there eight years.  During the time that I was on the housing authority, the 40 apartments in Dixie Manor [Housing Project, Pearl City, Boca Raton, Florida] that had been built back in '42 [1942] for the black soldiers and their wives, we renovated those apartments and we added on to there 90, 95 [sic, 45 apartments were added for a total of 95] other apartments on the back end of Dixie Manor.  We ended up with a community center there.  I missed one meeting out of eight years in housing authority.  And that one meeting they decided to name the community center 'The Lois Martin Community Center' [1985].  So when I went back to the meeting the next time, Norman Wymbs say, "We did it while you were gone."  But what happened was that they didn't understand where I was coming from.  Norman Wymbs used to be the mayor of Boca Raton.  So he knew all the ins and outs, he knew the people involved and everything.  And I knew if he was chairman that we can get much more done if--rather than my being chairman, feeling my way through when he knew the way through.  So I would never allow them to nominate me and I accept it, to be the chairman.  He wanted me to be the chairman.  But what I was tryin' to do is get as much as I can, which I did, by being the vice chairman and lettin' him be the chairman.  So I worked with that [Boca Raton Housing Authority] from 1978 to 1976 [sic, 1986].
Speaker 1: Nineteen eighty six [1986].
Speaker 2: Nineteen eight--'78 [1978] to '86 [1986], okay.
Story_ID: 56945
Speaker 1: During this time you're still in Pearl City [Boca Raton, Florida].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And how had it changed from when you were a child till then until right now, and how did you help improve it while in the housing authority?  Besides, you know, you named that instance [expanding the Dixie Manor Housing Project in Pearl City, Boca Raton, Florida].  How other--what other improvements did you help to bring about to the area of Pearl City?
Speaker 2: The federal government CDBG [Community Development Block Grant] grant of the federal government, I had houses renovated in here at that time up on Lincoln Court [section of Boca Raton, Florida next to Pearl City].  We call all this Pearl City now, so we have extensions on the other side of Dixie Manor.  Working with the renovation of homes, getting extra lighting in here.  One--just a number of things that can be done through the housing authority and with the grant that we got from the federal government, which was quite a challenge.  And it was a big challenge because I would go to city hall and they want to know, "You [Lois Martin] come down all the time and I don't see anybody else with you.  How do we know you speaking for the people [residents of Pearl City] up there?"  So I rode my bike around to everybody house in here and I told them, I said, "Well now two weeks from now city council meeting, I want you down there."  So anyway, there were about 15 went down, and there was one stick lady, Mrs. Ossie Mae Stevens I truly remember, getting up to the mike and she says, "I want y'all to know that whenever Ms. Martin says something, we're behind her.  And she's sayin' it because we want her to say it."  So anyway they found out that I wasn't down there just for myself.  But again, it's just so hard tryin' to get people to work along with you because they're saying, "Why go for this when they're gonna get who they want to?  Why do this?  They're gonna do what they want to."  But my contention is I want to make sure that I've done all I can to try to get what I deserve and what I can get.  Then if I don't get something, it won't because I didn't try.
Speaker 1: So what were the houses in the Pearl City area like before the grant came?  Had they been--what, what type of condition were they in?
Speaker 2: Well the majority of the people kept the house up fairly decent I would say.  But again, they needed--some of them needed renovation.  But the majority of the people in this area where I live, kept their homes up a little better than the ones up in the northern section of what we call now all of this Pearl City.  But again, work.  And the majority of the young people in here, when they went off to school or if they got a decent job, they moved out of Pearl City.  So which means that we had nothing but the elderly people in here of those that couldn't move, or those that had a home and just, you know--so the children are gone.  They're makin' very little.  So you can't do very much to the home.  That is why I decided in 1977 that I was gonna build this house that we're in right now.  Because of the fact that I wanted to stay in the neighborhood and make sure that I see what's happening day-by-day.  And show the world that Pearl City is a nice place to live in and that it's a situation wherein you know, it isn't because in plenty instances that we can't live here.
Story_ID: 56946
Speaker 1: So your other endeavors such as Habitat for Humanity, Historic Preservation Board, Ebenezer [Missionary] Baptist Church [Boca Raton, Florida], all these service industries.  And at the same time you were still teaching.  Tell us about the time where you decided it's time to retire and--
Speaker 2: Well Habitat for Humanities, I been working with it since 1991 when it started.  In fact, there are only two of us that are still working with it from its inception in 1991.  I'm on the selection committee, which means that we have to review the applications that are sent in, check out their credit reference, check out the police report, check out where they're working, whether they are good workers, check to see where they're living.  Then after we get certain amount of information, then a team, a couple of people will go out to the home to see the living condition that the person is living under at that particular time and what have you.  So that's what our committee decides on who's going to get the house of Habitat for Humanity.  So we have a big job because I mean sometimes we have--when we open up the applications, we might get 75 applications.  And we have to dwindle it down from some of the things that I mentioned prior to now.  Your credit references just tell--whether you are trying to do anything about it.  Then we just eliminate you, you know.  If you're trying to do something about it, then we hold you in, or we get you on something else.  So we have to do that to come up with the people that are gonna have--get a Habitat house and here in the Boca [Raton] Delray [Beach] area when we first started out, they said they were going to charge like four hundred fifty dollars a month they would have to pay for twenty years and the house is theirs.  I said, "Well I'm gone."  I said, "If it's gonna be that high, I mean I, I'm not gonna work with you."  So they narrowed it down to three [hundred] twenty-five [dollars].  So a person in the Boca Delray area can get a home for three [hundred] twenty-five [dollars] for twenty years.
Speaker 1: And when you bring these people in who applied for it, do you teach them about how--what they should go about to maintaining mortgages and things? Do you teach them--
Speaker 2: We have, we have a support group that work along with each applicant and, and when they get the house too, they have someone to work--a support group that work along with them to make sure they maintain the house and they stay up on the--how you do certain things in connection with mortgages and taxes and all of that.  So it, it's not a case where you just throw them out after they once get the house.  And you do mentor them before they get the house.

Speaker 1: And your Historic Preservation Board sitting [unclear].
Speaker 2: Okay, I was at a meeting last night, Historic Preservation Board.  Last night we voted to declare the Pearl City area [Boca Raton, Florida] as a historic district last night in our board meeting [2002].  So it has two more places to go, the Planning Zoning Board and some of the other boards.  But it will come to fruition because this section here was here before anything else in Boca [Raton, Florida].  And [Old] Floresta is a historic district [since 1990], but Floresta [established 1925] came after Pearl City [established 1915] came.  So we don't have any Mizner homes [Addison Cairns Mizner was an American architect who played an integral role the development of Boca Raton, Florida in the 1920s] in to try to save in here, but we have our culture.  We have our churches, our houses that are wood that still left, that we have and that we cherish, and that we believe that if we can keep them from tearing down this area because it's in a strategic part of--portion of Boca, this property is dear to other people but it's dearer to us cause we're right in the shadow of Mizner Park [upscale shopping, dining, and entertainment center in Boca Raton, Florida].  And we are to the east of the railroad track.  So the Historic Preservation Board--we, we are concerned with the outside appearance of the historic places.
Story_ID: 56948
Speaker 1: All these--outside of your education, school education, being an educator, all these other things are still extensions of that education.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You--do the Ebenezer [Missionary] Baptist Church [Boca Raton, Florida] a historic--you want people to still--speak to that, just how important that is even in all these things.  How you desire for others to be educated on--no matter what the subject is, just to be--having knowledge and understanding of things and its value.  Just speak to that.
Speaker 2: Well the thing is that everybody have a--need to have a chance to be able to pursue their education, to be all that they can be.  And God has provided for us.  You just gotta use it.  And the thing is this, that sometimes you don't get a chance to use it.  But that doesn't give you the reason to not try to get the chance to use it.  So again, I work with kids, I tutor kids any time they want it.  I come and tutor them for nothing.  I buy materials for nothing and tutor them.  I have gone out--there is a place out called The Haven [therapeutic group home for boys ages 9-18 in Boca Raton, Florida], which is a place for abused kids or kids whose parents have gone to jail or whatever, they are there.  And I go out--I haven't gone out there lately.  But I've gone out there and tutored kids math at that particular place.  I have worked at the Lois Martin [Community] Center [Boca Raton, Florida] with kids trying to get a GED [General Education Development] diploma.  And so many places, you know that--whatever I can do because of the fact that I want to see everybody just be able to get along and, and to realize that there's something good about everybody, no matter whether you in first grade or finished college.  There's something good about each person, and develop that person to the maximum.  And I just work with the kids and I mean if the church--I'm now the treasurer of the church, Ebenezer Baptist Church.  And that has been a male job all the time.  And so I told them, I said, "Well you all have been doin' it all the time, but most of the time a, you know, you've had conflicts.  Here I am with the ability, with the knowhow, can do it.  I been treasurer of Carver High School (Delray Beach, Florida) and I had much more money comin' through my hand there than you'll ever have here.  And I can do it.  So now it's a matter of whether you wanna accept me."  So we got a pastor that's an educator.  And when I volunteered it didn't take him but three days after he found out I had volunteered to contact me and tell me that I'm ready for you to be the treasurer.  So there again I work well with the church.  I told him that I didn't mind being the treasurer, but I wouldn't be counting money during the time the preacher's preachin', you know.  Everybody wanna do their work during the church time and when church turn out, everybody go home.  But my contention was that if you know what you're doing with the length of time you have, I can do it and still be inside to hear the pastor when he preaches, and that's what I go there for; to worship God, not to count money.  That's the secondary part of it.
Story_ID: 56949
Speaker 1: Your determination, that spirit of determination you have that was spoken to when at FAMU [Florida Agricultural & Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] you refused to accept any other job that wasn't paying forty-four fifty.  How is that personality and the part of you, that determination, not only enabled you to receive an education, but to teach others?
Speaker 2: Well all you have to do is look at the life I live and what I do and which way I go.  And they can see there was determination, you can do anything.  So the [Dr.] Martin Luther King Memorial [Historic Pearl City District, Boca Raton, Florida] we have in the front of Ebenezer [Missionary] Baptist Church [Boca Raton, Florida] over there, I'm the treasurer of the [Boca Raton] Martin Luther King [Memorial] Foundation here in Boca Raton [Florida] also.  And we worked hard to try to get that.  And it's a beautiful place out there.  In fact, it's much prettier than any I have seen and I've seen a many of them, including the one [Martin Luther King, Jr., National Historic Site] in Atlanta, Georgia.  But ours is prettier than that.  And as I said you know, if you're ready and willing, God will help you.  And that's the main thing I try to get people to see is that trust God and lean not to your own understanding [Proverbs 3:5].  He, he, he's ready.  And I have prayer meeting here at my house every Monday night.  Been having it for 11 years.  I mean we have holidays and the people are still here cause you know we celebrate most of the holidays on Monday.  But it can be a, you know a holiday, they still come.  I get a call from Jamaica as quick as I would from California.  Mrs. Martin, so and so, and so will you pray with me on this?  Why?  Because they can see the fruit I bear.  I'm not a fluke, I'm for real.  I believe that with God all things are possible [Matthew 19:26].
Story_ID: 56950
Speaker 1: Now what is your--I wanna know your take on what you feel the role of black educators is today, 2002, what the role of black educators is today as compared to what it was when you first started teaching in 1950.
Speaker 2: Well I can't really give you an answer on that because there's so many different avenues that we can go in now that were not open back then when you were talking about, when I came along as an educator.  For the most part all we could do was be a teacher for the most part, you know a nurse, or preacher you know.  But so many avenues have opened up, and the internet and the computer and everything else.  So I would say that what we need to do is just remember that every child deserves your attention to the point wherein you will teach them as much as they will allow you to teach them, rather than just goof off because you can goof off.  As I said, I teach--when I was teaching after my son was born, I would just remember--and I say to myself I'm going to teach every day as if my son is sitting in this classroom.  And I know I want him to get a good education.  So I did my best.  I came before school, stayed after school, I worked hard with kids.  And I used to tell the white kid and the black kid, "You in bad shape."  I said, "I'm here before school, after school.  Every person that come before school or after school usually are from Korea, Vietnam, Japan or wherever.  Their parents are bringing them, getting--letting them have this extra tutoring for nothing.  And you, the white student and the black student, instead of you coming, you're trying to figure out what you--the least you can do while you're even here.  And if you look around on the valedictorian list and the salutatorian list at Atlantic High School [Delray Beach, Florida] every time, most of the time it's one of them that are here."  I said, "Don't let them be--get to the point wherein they are the rulers of these United States."
Story_ID: 56951
Speaker 1: So what do you think of the American education system right now?  As American students, what do you think of American students and their zeal for education?
Speaker 2: It's rough because of the fact that the parent, the home have broken down and that from the school, from the church to the home, has played a very important part in education.  And the homes are broken down.  And it's gonna be much worse later on with all of these baby boomers I call it, coming up in connection with them having that zeal to want to be all that they can be.  So you need parents that are concerned, that will work along with the--their children.  See that their children come in at appropriate time.  But what's happening is the children are running the world almost because of the fact that they're tellin' mama what I'm not gonna do, and what I'm going to do.  And there are plenty parents that are folding because of the fact of peer pressure and they afraid that child might not like them as well because of the fact that I don't let you do certain things that the other child is doing.  But you know, that's all gonna really mess up this situation.
Story_ID: 56952
Speaker 1: Ms. Martin what are your hopes and concerns for the black community?
Speaker 2: I really hope that number one, we get on one accord.  That we can sit down intelligently and work and talk with each other and realize that we are our brother's keeper.  And if I can do math and you can do English and I need something done that I need to send out and you can check it over to make sure my English is proper or what have you, do it.  You have your income tax and you can't figure out these numbers, bring it to me, I'll do it.  So that's what we have to do is to--we have to work with each other and realize each other's advantages or disadvantages or whatever, and work with it.  And realize that God is the answer.  I, I keep going back to that because we're just pushing God to the side and we mess it up and then we wanna go back, let's pray.  We should have been praying a long time ago, you know.  Says watch as well as pray.
Story_ID: 56953
Speaker 1: On that, you remember when prayer was taken out of school [The U.S. Supreme Court ruled government-directed prayer in public schools unconstitutional in 'Engel v. Vitale' (1962)].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you think there's been a big shift and that's the problem?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's a big problem.  In 1965 to '70 [1970], I taught at the Booker [T.] Washington High School in Montgomery, Alabama.  And that's the one thing I gave Governor [George] Wallace [45th governor of Alabama] credit for.  He said, "I'm not gone let those coonies up there tell me what to do.  We're going to read the Bible and pray in our high school still."  So every morning over the intercom we had scripture read and a prayer before school every morning.  And the school was so much different from the other schools because we didn't have a dean of girls and a dean of boys.  The principal come up, "You were fighting him?  Did you hit him?"  "Yes."  "Go home for two weeks."  "Did you hit him back?"  "No."  "Go into classroom."  No who started what, you know.  And for that reason, you had more harmony in the school because of the fact that they started out right.  We didn't have all of these avenues that they can go into and, and try to figure out who did what and when and how and all of that, and I thanked him for that.
Speaker 1: So you think we need to put it back in school?
Speaker 2: No, no, I know it, it needs to be back there.
Story_ID: 56954
Speaker 1: So one final question.  What do you want to be remembered for?  What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Really, I did all, I did all that I can do to help others as I travel on my way home to be with God.  I want to always let the life I live exemplify myself, rather than the words I speak.  I want my word to be secondary, but how I live to be the primary thing.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much Mrs. Lois Martin.
Speaker 2: God bless you.
