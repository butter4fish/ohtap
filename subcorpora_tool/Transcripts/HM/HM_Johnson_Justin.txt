Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe, I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's C-R-O- ? C-R-O-W? I--
Speaker 1: C-R-O-W-E.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Russell Crowe.  Is he your son?
Speaker 1: No, he's not.  He's closer to my age than you would think (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No, he's one hell of an actor.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And what I like about him, he's independent.  I mean, when he's being interviewed, he says what he's thinking.
Speaker 1: He sure does.  He seems to do what he wants to do, too.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But, my name is Larry Crowe, out of Kentucky.  I mean, my, the name is.  I'm interviewing today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Sir, could you please give us your full name and spell it for us please.
Speaker 2: Yes, sir.  It's Justin Morris Johnson [HistoryMaker Justin Johnson], J-U-S-T-I-N, middle name M-O-R-R-I-S, J-O-H-N-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, is there any significance to the first name of Justin?
Speaker 2: There is.  My father [Oliver Johnson] was an attorney, and my mother [Irene Morris Johnson] named two of her five children--I'm named Justin, my sister's named Justine [Justine Johnson]--and mom has told us that that was because of Justinian [Justinian I], the early law giver in the Roman times.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I thought there was a significance to that.  Okay.  And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: August 19th, 1933, Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania, which is a small borough just east of the City of Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: All right.  And how do you spell Wilkinsburg?
Speaker 2: W-I-L-K-I-N-S-B-U-R-G.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Or as we would have said in high school [Wilkinsburg High School, Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania], (singing) "W-I-L-K-I-N-S-B-U-R-G. That spells Wilkinsburg," (laughter).
Speaker 1: Thank you (laughter).  So what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm a retired lawyer, and you might say a retired intermediate appellate court judge.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I retired last December, December 31st, 1980, 1985.
Speaker 1: Now, were you a member of the--
Speaker 2: Eighty-seven [1987].
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Pennsylvania supreme court [Supreme Court of Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: I would--no, no.  It was the superior court [Superior Court of Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Superior court.
Speaker 2: Which in Pennsylvania was an intermediate appellate court.  We would get most of the appeals coming out of our trial courts.  And then after we would decide those matters, the supreme court had the right to decide whether it wanted to hear another appeal.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, a step, one step below the supreme court.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: All right.  And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is August the 11th, 2008.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: You're in my living room in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania at 4911 Ellsworth Avenue, which is in the Shadyside area of the City of Pittsburgh.
Story_ID: 611950
Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth, there are five lightweight, People magazine-ish type questions that management compels me to ask of everyone and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Make my day.
Speaker 1: The first question is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: I--When you say one favorite, no.  I love vegetables. You know, when my wife [Florence Lester Johnson] has peas, or broccoli, or, or asparagus, or asparagus tips.  I, I love vegetables.  Favorite food, I love meatloaf, I love mashed potatoes, this is not one food.  I--my wife will tell you, I like ice cream too much, of any flavor.  So it might be that ice cream is my favorite food, but because I'm diabetic, I don't take more than a bowl of that a day.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue.
Speaker 1: All right.  Favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: I've never thought about that.  Possibly spring, when we're coming out of the chills and the birds are singing and the flowers are blooming.  Spring is a time when life is reborn, if you will.  Easter's coming, that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I'd say no, in part because I grew up observing my parents not vacationing.  I think the first vacation my father [Oliver Johnson] had, he would have been in his early seventies, late sixties, and we took a trip from Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] to the West Coast.  And it was a quite humorous trip, in part because dad, who was diabetic, was rushing to get to Los Angeles [California] where some relatives of ours would be able to give him the kind of diet that he was used to.  And the rest of us in the car were interested in seeing parts of the United States we'd never seen before.  And there was one point where we saw a billboard along the highway.  "Relax, enjoy yourself, leave the driving to us," by Greyhound [The Greyhound Corporation; Greyhound Lines, Inc.].  And from that point forward, we would be making all these jokes.  I remember my Aunt Josephine [Josephine Morris], who was on the trip, she would say, "Okay.  We're coming up on to this monument.  Now, Justin [HistoryMaker Justin Johnson], you go ahead and look at this.  Irene [Irene Johnson], you look at this.  Justine [Justine Johnson], it's your job to look at this."  The idea being that we wouldn't have time for any of us to fully enjoy the whole thing.  But I'd, I'd say the first vacation that I remember as being my vacation, would have been to Acapulco, Mexico after I had joined a firm here in Pittsburgh as a special partner.  And that would have been in 19--1979.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it wasn't until late that you really had a vacation?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Since then, my wife and I have been to different places in Europe and Africa.  My wife has been more places than I have, and I'm happy for that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now the last one is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: One of my favorite phrases would be one that my mother [Irene Morris Johnson] had used in the home all the time.  "Choose ye this day whom ye shall serve.  But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord."  And of course, that's Joshua speaking to the diaspora at the end of the book there [Joshua 24:15].  And prior to their trip into Israel.
Story_ID: 611951
Speaker 1: Now I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --and your father's [Oliver Johnson] side.  But we'll start with your mother's side first.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: She was born Irene Olive Morris [Irene Morris Johnson], and that, her middle name would have been O-L-I-V-E, and her last maiden name, M-O-R-R-I-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She would have been born sometime in, I'm going to say, 1894, I, I can't come up with her date of birth.  I'm, I just am not sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where was she born?
Speaker 2: I believe she was born in old Alleghany, which today is the North Side section of the City of Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].  Her father, Joseph E. Morris [Joseph Morris] was an African Methodist Episcopal minister, which meant that he travelled throughout this area, and at the time mom was born, he was the pastor at the Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church on what is now the North Side.
Speaker 1: Hm.  Okay (Background noise).
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): We're rolling again.
Speaker 2: All right.  I just wanted to repeat what I said in the--
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: --break, that your--
Speaker 1: Mother?
Speaker 2: Grandfather on your mother's side was named Morris, and he was in charge of Morris Brown chapel, really, the A.M.E. Brown Chapel being named for Morris Brown.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay.
Speaker 2: A.M.E.  I thought it was interesting, kind of, you know.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And of course Pittsburgh is a strong A.M.E. city.
Speaker 1: I think that's fair.  Bethel A.M.E. [Bethel A.M.E. Church, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], we call it Mother Bethel here, and it was an offshoot from Mother Bethel [Mother Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church] in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], which was the first A.M.E. church, I believe, in the United States.
Speaker 2: Yes, sir.  That's right, that's right.  So this is, Pennsylvania's kind of like the home of A.M.E. church in a lot of ways.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: In that sense.  So, okay, so you said her father was a pastor of Brown Chapel A.M.E., and--
Speaker 1: At the time she was born.  He also pastored churches in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, Erie, Pennsylvania, Titusville, Pennsylvania.  In those days, they were like a circuit rider.  Granddad, whom I did not know, he died before I was born.  He would jump on his motorcycle and just go wherever he had to go to, to, to be pastor.  I mean, even if he had a major church like Uniontown, he would be expected to handle churches nearby, which probably would not have had a minister.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So he actually had a motorcycle he would ride to these churches (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.  In fact, his, he ended his life going over the front of a motorcycle, which his neck was broken.  And as I say, that was well before I was born.  I never knew my maternal grandfather.
Story_ID: 611952
Speaker 1: Can you go back further than, than him, I mean, into the--so he, he would have been born, I would guess, in the 1860s or '70s [1870s], maybe?
Speaker 2: I guess that would be true, going back further, yes.  Christian Morris would be my great-grandfather.  And I think that one of the things that we say, and I believe it's true, is that he had served, I know it's true, he had served in the Civil War.  My great-grandfather on my mother's [Irene Morris Johnson] side, because he's buried in a veteran's grave in Erie, Pennsylvania.  Now I do remember, as a child, visiting him, or, or I'd better say, visiting his grave, when we would have driven up towards Erie.  And there is a veteran's property up there with a cemetery nearby, and I had the opportunity to see the tombstone of Christian Morris, my great-grandfather.  And I don't have any information about his wife.  That, that's as far back as I can go.  Well, I guess I skipped Reverend Morris' wife, Emma Gilkerson Morris, lived in Monongahela [Pennsylvania] where granddad pastored the St. Paul A.M.E. Church.  And as a child during the latter part of the Depression [Great Depression], any time we had a vacation, that vacation was driving from Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] to Monongahela and spending a couple of days with Grandma in a little frame house that she had right on the railroad tracks in Monongahela, PA.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In those days you had your slop jar, and the outhouse, and the pump at the, you know the, in the kitchen.  You drew your water by pumping the water right there at the sink.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so as far as you know, I mean, your family on your mother's side has roots right around here in Pennsylvania?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's correct.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: That's correct.  Because other relatives we had were in Lancaster, PA [Lancaster, Pennsylvania], which is pretty far east, but it's still Pennsylvania.  Joseph E. Morris [Johnson's maternal grandfather, Joseph Morris] may have been born in Lancaster.  I'm not sure of that.  The, my grandfather, but all of his pastoring was here in the, around the Pittsburgh area.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there, are there any stories or tales about your mother's family in slavery at all?  Or was it all (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't have any of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My brother, Livingstone Johnson, may have.  I, I, I know nothing about that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  'Cause I know the history of free black people and Pittsburgh goes back to the 18--early 1800s you know, so--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.  I don't doubt that.  Christian Morris, I know, spent the last years of his life in a veterans home in Erie.  But his particip- and there's no question he was in the war.  The stories have not been given to me, and I don't say that critically about what he may have been doing, what role he played in the war, or--
Speaker 1: Was he actually--was Erie his hometown?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Well, these are some things that I guess if somebody wanted to find out, they could, you know, research it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My, my brother Livy would probably know that, or maybe my sister Justine [Justine Johnson].  I've never given that thought.
Story_ID: 611953
Speaker 1: What did your mother [Irene Morris Johnson] talk about in terms of growing up?  Did she share stories about growing up with you?
Speaker 2: Well, she had lost a sister, Mahulda [Mahulda Morris], who would have been, I think, the second child in her family.  There was mom, there was Mahulda, there was Lois [Lois Morris], and there was Josephine [Josephine Morris], four daughters.  And when they were growing up in Braddock, PA [Braddock, Pennsylvania], that was before you had overpasses and they were crossing the tracks there in Braddock, right around 6th Street.  I'm sorry, in North Braddock [Pennsylvania], which is, which is right next door.  And a train came and, and struck Mahulda and killed her when she was only sixteen years of age, I believe.  Mom would occasionally talk about her participation in church, because understandably, she was always in church.  Her, her father [Joseph Morris] was the pastor, and mom would have played piano for the Sunday school, and that sort of the thing.   I don't recall at this time tales which she may have told about her life or the life of the family in those early days.  I just don't, I either don't remember, or I wasn't around when those stories were being told.
Story_ID: 611954
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you have a sense that they had a, that they had, was it, was it tough growing up for her do you think?  Or did she get a chance to--
Speaker 2: Well I do know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) you know, complete high school?
Speaker 2: I, I do know that when she was a student at Wilberforce [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio], what was then Wilberforce college, I guess.  In fact, it was just Wilberforce period.  She had a job working for one of the African American insurance companies.  North Carolina Mutual [North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company], I think it was.  And she had another job as a secretary at one point.  Which left me with the understanding that her father [Joseph Morris], as an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] minister, would not have had sufficient funds to keep her in Wilberforce without her working.  Though, I don't think mom ever said that, but as I think about it, when I was growing up in the A.M.E. church, we never had a minister who could survive on what we were providing for him through the Sunday collection.  They all had to have a, a real job, if you will.  I don't think that's necessarily true today.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's maybe different today.  But a lot of churches are in the same situation.  Ministers got to work, you know.  Okay, so she went to Wilberforce--
Speaker 2: Wilberforce.
Speaker 1: Did she become a teacher as a result, or--?
Speaker 2: She did.  She did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She got a degree in home economics, and when you say, "Did she become a teacher," she was teaching right at Wilberforce for, I believe, two years before she married my father [Oliver Johnson].  And following that marriage, she never had to work again.  She was a homemaker, a housewife, raised five children.  She bore eight children.  She had a set of twins, which did not survive their first birthday, pneumonia or something.  Then she had another child, which due to the, you might say the lack of medical technology in those days, did not live that long.  But she raised five.  Her oldest of those five was killed in the Second World War [World War II, WWII].  On Lincoln's [President Abraham Lincoln] birthday, 1945.  His name was Oliver Morris, Oliver Morris Johnson.
Story_ID: 611955
Speaker 1: Let me go to your father's side.
Speaker 2: Sure (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: It was Oliver Livingstone Johnson [Oliver Johnson].  And of course, the Livingstone is with an E.  Some people spell it Livingston without the E.  Oliver Livingstone Johnson, and--okay.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth, and place of birth?
Speaker 2: It would have been March 11th, 1892.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where was he born?
Speaker 2: I want to say in White Hall, Virginia.  Which is outside Charlottesville [Virginia], I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Small community.
Speaker 1: Now in terms of his name, I know that there's a Livingstone College [Salisbury, North Carolina], the same spelling, that's an A.M.E. Zion [African Methodist Episcopal Zion] school in North Carolina.  I don't know, is there any--
Speaker 2: There would have been no connection.  No dad would have been Baptist all the way.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I wanted to say the, you know, in the 118 Psalm, "This is the stone that the builders rejected" [Psalm 118:22], and then it's repeated in Second Peter [sic.].  The idea of Christ being a living stone, which is in the Bible.  And my guess is that dad's mother [Georgia Johnson] probably was taking that recognition from the New Testament at least, with the name Livingstone.  I doubt very much that he was named for a school.
Speaker 1: Well thank you very much for that, 'cause I never knew where the name Livingstone came from, as such spelled like that.  And now I think I know (laughter).
Speaker 2: It's right, it's right in, I want to say it's, I want to say First Peter [First Epistle of Peter], fifth or sixth chapter.  I could be very wrong on that.  I know it's in Peter, and that's picked up from the 118th Psalm.  I'm saying, "This is the stone that the builders rejected," or maybe, "Behold the stone that the builders rejected."  The idea being, of course--
Speaker 1: The rock upon which the church is built?
Speaker 2: And you have Jesus coming in on Friday, riding on the palms, and everybody is: "Hosanna, here's our savior," and then two days later, well even that, the next day, "Crucify him, crucify him."  So the people rejected Him, not realizing what he had brought to this Earth.  And so now, we look and see that He is the keystone, He's the center of many people's lives, even though Ge had been rejected, which would fulfill the prophecy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'd never heard the explanation of that name before like that.  That's good.
Story_ID: 611956
Speaker 1: What can you tell us about your father's [Oliver Johnson] side of the family?  How far back can you trace that side?
Speaker 2: I know that his, that my--well, my father's father, William Bellfield Johnson [William Johnson].  I got to know him and love him because he lived in Braddock [Pennsylvania], where of course, dad had been raised after his father brought him from Virginia.  But his grandfather was such a nice person, he would call my mother [Irene Morris Johnson], dear, and he would call all the children, what was the name he gave for us?  Sweetheart, or something like that.  And granddad had a leather snap purse, maybe five inches long, where he had all of his money.  And we would walk from Wilkinsburg [Pennsylvania] to Braddock, which would have been about, I'm gonna say at least a four mile walk.  Maybe four and a half miles.  And when we would get there, Granddad would always have a coin for each of the four children, five children who had made that walk.  And he, his occupation was collecting rags in Braddock.  He had one of these old wagons with, would you say, a four and a half, five foot wheel on it, metal banded.  And he would push, it was a push cart, I called it a wagon.  He would push that cart through Braddock and collect rags, and then sell the rags for whatever he could make.  So it was clear, and he lived in what was literally a storefront about one block from the railroad tracks in Braddock.  And I remember he had a potbelly stove in the back there, which would have been his only heat.  And I guess his bedroom was in the front where the windows (background noise) were either--
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Okay.  We were talking about your grandfather, William Bellfield.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, where is Bellfield? Is there a story behind that name, Bellfield?
Speaker 2: I don't know, other than the fact, well, the story would be that his mother's last name, I'm pretty sure was Bellfield.  Amanda Bellfield [ph.], and here, I'm, I'm stretching to try and remember the name.  But Granddad's mother is bur- wait a minute.  Yeah, Grand- Granddad's mother is buried in the cemetery in White Hall, Virginia.  Excuse me.  That, as to why the name Bellfield, I can't say anything more than that.
Speaker 1: Okay. Are there stories from his side of the family that go back to slavery?
Speaker 2: There would have to be, but I don't have those.  You know, I think you're asking for vignettes, or something which really occurred, and I don't have that.  Other than knowing that with my father having been born in 1892, his father had to have been born probably around the 1860s or '70s [1870s], maybe.  Which meant either my great-grandfather on that side was in slavery or his father was.  But I don't have any of that story, no.
Story_ID: 611957
Speaker 1: Was White Hall [Virginia], was he like in a, your [paternal] grandfather [William Johnson], like in a rural setting? Where he worked?
Speaker 2: It would have been a farm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: In fact really, one of the, I think, one of the most striking stories in my background is that when my father [Oliver Johnson] came back from the Second World War [sic. World War I, WWI] in 1918, although he was permitted to return to the Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts], they, he had to finish at the University of Pittsburgh [University of Pittsburgh School of Law, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] because they had no money.  In order for him to enter Harvard Law School, before he went to war, my grandfather sold a parcel of land in Virginia, and I think he got three hundred dollars for it, and that was the money which dad needed in order to enroll at Harvard Law School.  So that's a story which would reflect the fact that for African Americans, as for anybody else, land can be a very important asset.  And in this case, without that asset, dad would have never gotten to Harvard Law School.
Speaker 1: Well, this sounds like a dramatic story, I'm sensing.  You described your grandfather as a, as a rag collector?
Speaker 2: In Pennsylvania, that's correct.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: He sold his farm in Virginia--
Speaker 1: To send his son to--
Speaker 2: To law school.
Speaker 1: To law school.  How many siblings did your father have?
Speaker 2: How many?
Speaker 1: Brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: He, okay.  He had his sister Precious, and his sister Olive [ph.] here in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].  In fact, all of his, he would have had the two sisters, Aunt Precious, whom I knew as Missus Precious Parrot [Precious Johnson], and Aunt, Aunt Ruth.  I'm sorry, Aunt Ruth Franklin [Ruth Johnson Franklin], which was dad's sister, who lived in North Braddock [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your father, was your father the only male, was he the only son?
Speaker 2: As far as I'm aware.  I don't recall, I don't ever recall having either a uncle who was alive, or an uncle who was referred to.
Speaker 1: It just sounds like, you know, quite a sacrifice.  It is the kind of sacrifice that a father would make for his son--
Speaker 2: Um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) his only son.  So your father grew up in White Hall?
Speaker 2: White Hall, Virginia.
Speaker 1: And then--
Speaker 2: No, no.  My father was born in White Hall, he probably was brought to, he had to have been brought to Pittsburgh sometime before he was eighteen years of age because he graduated from Braddock High School [Braddock, Pennsylvania].  And he knew my mother before he graduated, so I'm guessing he had to have been maybe, no older than thirteen or fourteen when he was brought from Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he graduated from Braddock High School.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And I think you were telling me before we started the interview, that in Braddock, he was--
Speaker 2: He was one of only, he was one of only three blacks who graduated, and interestingly, the second black who graduated that year was my mother, Irene Olive Morris [Irene Morris Johnson].  And the third black was a gentleman named Heinselman Price [sic. Clarence Roy], whom as I was growing up, he was around.  I didn't know him that well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your father, he was a good student, I take it?
Speaker 2: He must have been.  He must have been, and I think it's fair to say he was an industrious student who applied himself.  Because anybody to enter Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and then to stay in Harvard, and get out at the end of the first year.  He clearly wasn't fooling around.  Let me jump way ahead.  I know that somewhere around among my books downstairs, I have--every year, schools will, you know, publish a directory of their graduates for the people who attended.  And dad would purchase several of the Harvard Law School directories.  I have one from back in the '40s [1940s] I believe, with dad's name in it, although he did not get his degree there.  And dad I'm sure, was always quite proud of the fact he had attended Harvard.  The rest of the story is that my son, Justin Llewellyn [Justin L. Johnson], had first gone to the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] and gotten his bachelor's [degree].  He then attended Harvard and got his law degree at Harvard, which for me, was a completion of what his grandfather had tried to do and did not have the money to do.  So I'm happy that my son, Justin Llewellyn, was to come up with a black Harvard grad out of the Johnson family.
Story_ID: 611958
Speaker 1: I just wanted to go back and kinda recap what you were saying about your father [Oliver Johnson].  When, when your father graduated from Brad- was it Bradford High School?
Speaker 2: Braddock. Braddock (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Braddock High School [Braddock, Pennsylvania]. Yeah.
Speaker 2: Which is, is a borough here in southwestern Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: Okay.  He went from there to Howard, or--
Speaker 2: Howard University [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Howard University, okay.
Speaker 2: As an undergraduate.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Got a degree in liberal arts or political science, I would guess.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.  And then he went to, to Harvard Law [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: He went directly to Harvard Law School from there at the end of his first year, he was drafted, inducted into the [U.S.] Army for the First World War [World War I, WWI], spent two years in the Army--
Speaker 1: So this is 1917?
Speaker 2: Would have been '16 [1916], I believe.
Speaker 1: Sixteen [1916]?  Nineteen sixteen [1916], okay.
Speaker 2: Well, let me think.  It could have been '17 [1917], because he came out of Braddock High in '12 [1912], he went to Howard for four years, so that would be '16 [1916].
Speaker 1: Yeah, '16 [1916].
Speaker 2: May of '16 [1916], so--but he did get in a year at Harvard--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So you're probably right, 1917.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's the heart of the war there.
Speaker 2: And in the war, he served in the Argonne Forest.  This, this is an area you'd never hear of today.  But in the First World War, that was one of the big battles, at the Argonne Forest.  I remember as a child, underneath the steps leading down into our basement, was hanging what I'll call a gas mask.  In those days, you had a mask over your face, then a large elephantine like tube, which fit into a metal canister, and that's what all the soldiers were supposed to be wearing.  They did gas openly in the First World War.  Today they do it secretively.
Speaker 1: That's right.  That's right.  So it was a horrible war.  People would describe World War I, the historians say was more horrible in some ways than any other war because of the modern weapons and the old tactics.  And the, yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, so did your father have any stories?  Did he serve with the French Army?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no.  He was in the United States Army.
Speaker 1: What I'm saying is they were often attached to the French Army--
Speaker 2: That I don't know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) 'cause they don't want them actually.
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: I mean, they wanted them, but they didn't want to manage them.
Speaker 2: I know he had achieved the rank of sergeant.  I'm assuming that he, he had to have been in the--what I'm gonna call the infantry.  Simply, simply because, in order for him to be in combat in, in the force, he wasn't a cook.  You know, in the Second World War [World War II, WWII], for a long time, blacks, certainly in the [U.S.] Navy were relegated to service positions, and in the Army too.  Certainly in the Air Force [U.S. Army Air Corps; U.S. Air Force].  It, it wasn't until well into the Second World War, that African Americans were permitted to fly in combat.
Speaker 1: That's right.  That's right.  So are there any stories that he tells about those days?
Speaker 2: I don't--I really don't remember any.  I'm sorry.  Again, my brother Livy [Livingstone Johnson], who is six years older than me, very well may have picked up--I don't remember dad as being the kind of person who would tell those kinds of stories.  He, he was an inward, very strong person who I don't recall reminiscing or talking about his background at all.  The only time he would mention his relatives, he would--he had an expression, "On my dead mother's grave."  Or no, "On my dead sister's grave," I think he would say.
Story_ID: 611959
Speaker 1: So when he, when he [Johnson's father, Oliver Johnson] came back from the war [World War I, WWI] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) From France.
Speaker 1: From France, he wasn't able to resume at Harvard Law [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?  Or was--
Speaker 2: Exactly.  And it was strictly money (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He didn't have train fare back from Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] to Boston, Massachusetts to return to law school.  So he enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh [University of Pittsburgh School of Law, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], and in those days, the law school was in downtown Pittsburgh, and what is then called the--what is now called the Commerce Building [Chamber of Commerce Building, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  Obviously now they're on the Pitt campus, only five blocks from where we're sitting.  But he entered at Pitt, served--was there two years, and got his LL.B., his bachelor of laws degree.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any, any stories about those days that he passed down to you about what it was like, or--'cause he had to be one of the few black students there, I would guess.
Speaker 2: That would be true.  No, I don't remember any stories about his, his difficulties or battles at the Pitt law school.  I know that it was generally understood that they had quotas then so that there would only be maybe one, or maybe, maybe two in the law school at any one time.
Speaker 1: And by quotas, it's not like today where the quotas are to help black people.  The quotas were to keep down the numbers (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly.  Exactly.  And at the time that they were admitting one or two blacks, I don't know that they were admitting Jewish students.  I don't know that.  Certainly on the medical--in the medical schools, they were excluding blacks and Jews until, I'd say, fairly recently.  Maybe in the '50s [1950s], that started to change.
Story_ID: 611960
Speaker 1: Now, let's go back to talk about how your parents met.  Now, they met in high school [Braddock High School, Braddock, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: They would have, they would have been high school sweethearts, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there a story that they tell about how they first started going together?
Speaker 2: I, I've never heard that. Well, to think about it, there are only three of the, three blacks who graduated.  So it's possible that if dad [Oliver Johnson] was looking for a girlfriend, mom [Irene Morris Johnson] may have been one of the few people--now, that, that's not fair to mom because she's a very beautiful person as a child.  But, the, the, the group of available men or women probably was small.  So it's not surprising.  Then again, that just isn't fair to my mother.  If she hadn't married dad, she may have married Heinselman Price [sic. Clarence Roy].  (Laughter) Those were the only two who graduated.
Story_ID: 611961
Speaker 1: When you think about your parents' personalities, and their talents, their dispositions.  Who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I think my mother [Irene Morris Johnson].  I think my mother, in part, because I tend to hold things inside.  I tend to save, hoard things, if you will.  When I say I tend to hold things inside, I remember when my older brother Oliver Morris [Oliver Morris Johnson] was killed in a Second World War [World War II, WWII].  I have a picture of the door--someone knocking at the front door.  I don't even think we even owned a doorbell at that time.  Someone brought a telegram.  Today, you know, they have soldiers, or [U.S.] Navy people come to the door, but someone brought a telegram and gave it to my mother, and it was announcing that Oliver Morris had been killed on February 12th, 1945.  And I wouldn't have known right at that moment that it was an announcement of his death, but I remember mom went upstairs.  In those days, women used a washboard to get the grime out of the clothes.  A metal board with a, with a, with waves in it, and mom, I know went to the bathroom and just kept doing the wash that day.  And my father [Oliver Johnson] was not aware of it until he got home that night.  I don't remember my mother ever breaking down.  She, she may have quietly cried or something, but mom never openly expressed her grief at having lost her oldest son.  And I, and I think back when my mother died, I was then a judge, and I--my employees would tell me that I'd gone to the funeral and about two hours after the funeral, I was back in my chambers trying to keep things going, which perhaps is a sign of a psychiatric problem of some sort.  But I, I do not display my emotions, and that's probably one of the reasons I'm undergoing depression right now, because my brother, Livingstone [Livingstone Johnson], openly lets you know how he feels, and I think he's in a lot better mental shape because of that.  But the fact that I--that I hide things, and also the fact that I see value in some things where my wife [Florence Lester Johnson], perhaps, does not see immediate value, I picked that up from watching my mother never throw anything out.  You know, when I was growing up, you would take what was then the--there's a word for it, that they would--well, what you lined cereal boxes with, what you lined different cellophane, not cellophane.  Was it cellophane?
Speaker 1: Yes.  It's kind of a waxy paper or something?
Speaker 2: Wax paper.  Mom would take wax paper from things that she had bought, and then she would use that to wrap the sandwiches for my father, which he then would take to work.  Whereas today, my wife goes and buys a big roll of Seratan [sic. Saran], or whatever those plastic things are.  And mom would save every jar, she would save everything that could be saved, and she'd find some use for it.  When she would fry bacon, she would have a can and put all of that fried, the fat, she'd put that in a can and then she would be able to use that can to flavor greens later on, do different things.  My wife never learned that.  And if I would go to the--our can to say, "Well, gee, maybe I can use some of this in my pancakes, or--." I'm looking in and I'm saying, "Well, you know, not only is there bacon fat in there, there's fish grease and everything else."  So little things like that.  I think I picked up from my mother a sensitivity and a quietness and a, stolidity is probably not the right word, but a firmness, and that's not to say, I think I got my generosity, if I have any, from my father.  Neither one of them had any money, but I recall at least once, maybe more than once, dad would come home with clients or friends for dinner, he would have not have told mom, and then I could watch mom biting her lip and going into the kitchen and trying to find enough food (laughter) for these guests, and it wouldn't have occurred to dad to think anything about it.  And he always was ready to help anybody who needed help, my father was.  In a way, that I think my mother quite properly put her first priority on the family and protecting her children.
Story_ID: 611962
Speaker 1: Tell us something about your father's [Oliver Johnson] practice.  Was it easier for him to--when he graduated from law school [University of Pittsburgh School of Law, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], was it easy for him to get started?
Speaker 2: I'd, I'd say it was not.  In a broad sense because we blacks as a culture believe that black professionals could not provide the same quality of service as a white professional.  So that I would observe blacks running, and I won't name names, but we had lawyers in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], who were just so-so lawyers, if you will.  Not that they were evil or anything like that, but they weren't that--they weren't that competent.  And blacks would go to them because of their reputation, all right?  Where they really weren't getting that great a service, but they were the white man, if you will.  So that dad had to fight that throughout the time that he was in the practice.  He had a partnership early in his career with a gentleman named Arthur Stevenson; but financially, that didn't work out.  Keep in mind, this was the Depression [Great Depression], and they had incurred debts.  Their partnership did not last and it ended up with dad having to pay all of the partnership bills, with Mr. Stevenson paying none of them.
Story_ID: 611963
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this, I don't think I really asked you what year your father [Oliver Johnson] finally graduated from the University of Pittsburgh law school [University of Pittsburgh School of Law, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Twenty-two [1922].
Speaker 1: Twenty-two [1922], okay.  So he came out in '22 [1922]?  So, okay.  So--
Speaker 2: He was either, the reason why I'm saying '22 [1922], I know he got married in June of '22 [1922].  It may be that they waited one year after he got out of school.  But I doubt that because they had been courting since high school [Braddock High School, Braddock, Pennsylvania], and one, that was a lesson that my mother [Irene Morris Johnson] provided to all of her children.  The principle being, you don't get married until you finish your education.  And each of her children, except me, that was true.  I was the baby.  I met Florence Lester [Florence Lester Johnson] in Chicago [Illinois], I'd been to the [U.S.] military, so--and I, I think on our first date, and this, this is a sign that I was already hooked.  On our first date, we caught a bus and we were going to a restaurant in downtown Chicago, and I was telling Florence that I could not get married until I'd finished my education. (Laughter) Now, why would you tell a person that you'd only known for a couple of weeks that you couldn't get married?  But we got married that June, and have had a beautiful life since then.  But no, mom, mom and dad were married on the campus at Wilberforce [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio], and by virtue of her being the son [sic. daughter] of a Methodist A.M.E. minister [Joseph Morris], mom liked to tell the story that there were three bishops.  Three A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] bishops who presided over her marriage.  The point being that it probably would have to stick once you have the three high people in the church saying (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In those days that would have been maybe Bishop Arnett [Benjamin W. Arnett], or Bishop--
Speaker 2: I'm sorry I can't give you the names.
Speaker 1: Stokes?
Speaker 2: Stokes is a name I've heard.
Speaker 1: Probably Rembert Stokes [Rembert E. Stokes].  You know, it's a, yeah.  Anybody could, yeah.  There would have been three around her.  Yeah.  Okay.  There's a strong connection between Wilberforce and Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] in terms of the A.M.E., you know, connection.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Tanner's, you know, Benjamin Tucker Tanner's son, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know, the artist was at Wilberforce, a lot of connections.
Speaker 2: More currently, I think I mentioned to you that I'm bad on names.  A young attorney who had served as an assistant attorney at the University of Pittsburgh [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], the whole university, he left the university to become the attorney for, I think, Wilberforce as opposed to Central State [Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: There's the two institutions there now.  I think he went to Wilberforce as their chief counsel.
Story_ID: 611964
Speaker 1: So your, your father [Oliver Johnson], you know, now, what really got his practice going?  I mean--
Speaker 2: When you say, got it going, I would say through the years it was high volume, low fee.  And by that is to say dad would handle just about anything that came through the door, but his, his clientele was the lower class, or maybe middle class blacks of the City of Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].  That's not to say that the firm did not have white clients, but they would have been in a small minority of, of the practice, if you will.  At the time dad was practicing, there would have been no more than six black attorneys in the city.  When I came along, there would have been Tom Barton [Thomas Barton], Theron B. Hamilton, Paul Jones, dad, Homer S. Brown, who became the first black judge in this county; Everett Utterback, who was with the urban redevelopment authority [Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh].  I think that's six.  I can't think of any other African Americans who were practice--oh,  Wendell Stanton, that's seven.  He was in the United States attorney's office.  But a relatively small group.  And dad was in what I will call an association.  They were not a partnership, but as I was in junior high [Wilkinsburg Junior High School, Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania] and high school [Wilkinsburg High School, Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania], I would go downtown, and dad was one of four attorneys in a suite, if you will.  They all shared one secretary, but they--none of them were partners with the other.  That was Barton, Hamilton, Jones and Johnson.  They all had their own stationary, they all kept their own books.  But they shared Alice Harshaw [ph.] as their secretary.  I think dad's practice, probably, if you were to graph it, began to move up when his older son, when his middle son, my brother, Livingstone [Livingstone Johnson], graduated from Michigan Law School [University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor, Michigan], 1957.  And it became Johnson and Johnson.  And Livy, of course, was coming in the so called modern practices, and a, and a progressive view about how to do business.  And I think that helped to move the firm along.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Subsequently, you would join the, the partnership (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly.  When I came out of Chicago [Illinois], 1962, then it became Johnson, Johnson, and Johnson.
Story_ID: 611965
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: (Pause) I have a memory--(cough) excuse me.  I have a memory of being on the back of my older brother, Oliver Morris [Oliver Morris Johnson], and I think I was wearing his military cap, and he would have had his uniform on, so he would have been home on leave.  And we were just playing out in front of the house, and this memory is attached, I believe, to a photograph that would have been taken in one of those Kodak collapsible cameras.  I, I can remember that.  I, I can remember playing softball in the backyard with dad [Oliver Johnson], and dad didn't have on sports clothes.  He would have taken his dress white shirt and, and wrapped it up his arms, and was pitching the ball to us.  And I probably--I couldn't have been more than, what, three or four, or five at the time.  Because our backyard was twenty feet by maybe eighteen feet (laughter).  And if you hit the ball, it probably was gonna end up in the neighbor's yard.  I, I remember that vaguely.  I do remember being--I think I was under the table, under the dining room table when mom [Irene Morris Johnson] either got the telegram about her son, or my brother's death, or when dad came home and learned about his death.  And I know--I remember that dad was very upset about it.  Verbally, openly upset at the government, not at, not at my mother.  That was a very traumatic time.
Story_ID: 611966
Speaker 1: How did he die again?
Speaker 2: My brother? Yeah.
Speaker 1: They--what I remember is he was standing guard, and someone sent us a letter after his death indicating that he would sing the Omega hymn ['Omega Dear'] when he was standing guard.  If you're familiar with the black fraternities, "Omega dear, I love you true, da, da, da, da.  And when we say that first--that last good bye, I love you so Omega."  I, I'm not an Omega [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity], but when I went to visit his grave in Luxembourg, I remember thinking about the Omega hymn, and thinking that my brother, Oliver Morris [Oliver Morris Johnson], may have been singing that hymn.  And, and a shell just came in, into the encampment and he, he died there while on guard duty.
Speaker 2: This was during World War II [WWII]?
Speaker 1: World War II on Lincoln's [President Abraham Lincoln] birthday, which sadly enough was--had to be within sixty days of the end of that war.  The surrender was declared either in April or May of 1945.  It continued on in Japan, but the hostilities were completed in Europe in the spring of 1945.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And for me, one of the, and I believe this to be true, Oliver Morris, my older brother, had the most potential of the five children that my mother [Irene Morris Johnson] was raising.  By that I mean to say, he was going to be a scientist, which in those days was unheard of.  He had done well at West Virginia State College [West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia], where he was a student.  He was in his senior year at West Virginia State when they pulled him for service.  And had a lot of promise.  Everyone who had been his instructor saw the gifts that he had.  But he never had the opportunity to demonstrate that because of the war.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you were twelve years old when your brother died?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Forty--yes.
Story_ID: 611967
Speaker 1: How many of you--how many brothers and sisters do you have?
Speaker 2: Mom [Irene Morris Johnson] raised five children.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She had three, which did not survive beyond early infancy, and of those five, Oliver Morris [Oliver Morris Johnson] was killed in 1945.  An older sister, my sister, Irene Morris Johnson Guardini [Irene Johnson], she had married an Italian doctor, she died in early February of this year in West Palm Beach, Florida.  The remaining three siblings are still--my Livingstone Johnson lives here in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].  He will be eighty-one in December.  My sister, Justine [Justine Johnson], who lives in Marietta, Georgia, she was seventy-nine last month.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you all are right together.
Speaker 2: We're two years apart.
Speaker 1: Two years apart?  Okay.
Speaker 2: I'll be seventy-six--I'm missing something.  No, I'll be seventy-five in August.  I retired a year early.  I'll be seventy-five in a week, August 19th.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I retired at seventy-five.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The reason I hesitated is because we're all two years apart, and if I'm trying to get ages, I--and I know my brother Livy's birthday is in December, so he's already gotten his--he's already eighty-one.  And I'll catch up with him in a week, and I'll be seventy-five.  Seventy-five, seventy-seven, seventy-nine, eighty-one.  And Oliver Morris, the oldest child would have been, I think maybe, three or four years older than Livy, were he alive.
Story_ID: 611968
Speaker 1: Did you grow up in--
Speaker 2: We all grew up in Wilkinsburg.
Speaker 1: Wilkinsburg, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania.  And that was interesting because, my parents, after they married, they bought their first home in Wilkinsburg, the, the first ward in which they bought the home, had never had a black family there.  Mom [Irene Morris Johnson] and dad [Oliver Johnson] were the first blacks on Ross Avenue in the first ward.  And I believe I'm correct at the time that they sold that home in 1959, some thirty-seven years later.  They still were the, at that point, they were still the only blacks in that ward.  We had grown up attending Johnston Elementary School [Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania] with a T, and we were the only blacks in the elementary school.  When we got to junior high [Wilkinsburg Junior High School, Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania], there may have been a few other blacks who lived in a few other parts of the borough.  But because mom insisted that each of us be in the academic track, again, I don't think, I know I never had a black classmate until I went away to college [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].  There were other blacks who graduated with me in 1951, but they had either been in commercial, or, or some other track.  Which is sad, but that's nothing, you know, that wasn't my fault.  That's the way the system was running.  That was still a time when the system would look at blacks and say, "Well, do you want to be a custodian, or you want to cut hair?"  You know, rather than saying, "You can be anything you want to be."
Speaker 1: Now, were your--was your father and mother involved with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] at that time?
Speaker 2: I don't want to say they were involved in the NAACP, but I will say my mother fought for the rights of her children on more than one occasion.  Examples would be where my sisters [Irene Johnson and Justine Johnson] were in the junior high school in Wilkinsburg, and the school district was saying that if they could find another nine blacks, then they could go ahead and use the swimming pool.  When (laughter)--this is true, and, and my mother would go up to the school and tell them no, that wasn't going to be.  That my sisters would be in the same class as their classmates.  She had to straighten that out.  And my guess is there were other instances where mom interceded, if you will, to ensure that her children didn't get special treatment, but got the same treatment as anybody else in the school system.  There were instances where she probably did not intercede and I'm not sure it would have--my brother [Livingstone Johnson] will tell the stories of how when he got to high school [Wilkinsburg High School, Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania], he was thinking about playing football, and the football coach as much as told him, "No, you'd do real good on the track team."  So that when my brother graduated, I believe, I don't know that there had been any blacks on the football team.  There may have been one or two.  When I graduated, there was one black, Richie Simmons [ph.], tight end on the football team.  But it was understood that Coach Browning [John Browning] really wasn't interested in blacks on the team.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But my mother was very active in the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in Wilkinsburg, and eventually served on the board of the YWCA of Greater Pittsburgh [YWCA Greater Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  And was an emeritus board member before she died.
Speaker 1: Yeah, YWCA was very active in--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --civil rights.
Speaker 2: Their motto today is, eradicating racism wherever it's found.
Story_ID: 611969
Speaker 1: Let's talk about something pleasant.  What were some of the sights, and sounds, and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: (Pause) I'd, I'd have to say that I'm probably a person who does not retain very well, early memories.  I guess, I guess I remember being at my [maternal] grandmother's [Emma Gilkerson Morris] home in Monongahela [Pennsylvania], where there was a low ceiling on the first floor, and we could lay on our tummies looking out the bedroom window on the second floor and when the trains would come by, and the tracks were literally not more than five feet from her front steps.  We could sit there and when the engineer would come by, he'd be at the same level as our eyes, which was--which we found exciting.  Sights, sounds and smells; I'll always remember our back alley which did not touch our property, but it came up behind Ross Avenue and then curved over to Penn Avenue.  But that's where we all played.  The alley would have been maybe, what, seventeen, eighteen feet in width.  And we played softball there, football there, where a telephone pole, I remember, was always first base.  And the alley was long enough that if you hit the ball fair, the worst that would happen is go onto a garage roof or, or into a parking lot or something.  I remember that.  Sights, sounds and smells.  I, I don't remember mom's cooking from a smell standpoint, though it--I always enjoyed it.  Mom [Irene Morris Johnson] was a, mom was really a great cook.  She would take a shad, a fish which people don't even hear about today, it's a very inexpensive fish.  And she'd take a large shad, debone it, and then stuff it and we'd have stuffed shad, which for us during the Depression [Great Depression], that was a, that was a delicacy, you might say.  Or she'd take a large cast iron skillet and do an upside down pineapple cake, which was a, which was a rarity.  I mean, just the fact that you had pineapple in those days.  You, you didn't have that very often.  But I can remember mom would do a skillet full of kidneys.  Now, I don't think it--I don't know that there are many places where you can go and get those off a menu today, but I enjoyed them.  Some people say, "(Makes sound) Kidneys," but mom would buy them fresh and, of course, they were inexpensive and that was a source of our meat.  The way--without your asking me for some specific thing, I just don't have recall.  And I don't know whether that's because I'm shutting them out, or whether I just didn't remember them that much (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, what was--
Story_ID: 611970
Speaker 1: What about church?  Did you--I imagine church was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Church was a regular occasion.  I have a very vivid picture of the Johnson children sitting around a radiator at the St. Mark A.M.E. Church in Wilkinsburg [Pennsylvania].  And when I say, "Sitting around the radiator," it was, it was sometimes the case that it would be the Johnson children and Mrs. Jones [ph.], the Sunday school teacher.  We'd be the only ones there for Sunday school.  And that's where I learned the expression the faithful few, because my mother [Irene Morris Johnson] insisted that we be at Sunday school regularly.  Our home on Ross Avenue was maybe seven blocks from the church.  And we, we'd all, well, we didn't even have a car until sometime in the, oh my heavens, the early, the early or mid-'40s [1940s] I would say.  But we would walk everywhere and walking to church was no problem.   I remember I had a--my brother had given me a trumpet and he had a trumpet.  So I remember a picture, I, Florence [Florence Lester Johnson], my wife has it somewhere. I don't know where it is.  A picture of the Sunday school standing on the inside steps of the church, and Livy [Livingstone Johnson] and I are both there with our trumpets at attention and there couldn't have been more than, oh, maybe fifteen people in the picture, which would have been our entire Sunday school.  I remember that.  I remember church and Sunday school as a pleasant place, as a, as a place that I was--looking back, maybe this is revisionist, but I think I enjoyed going to Sunday school.  I en- I didn't enjoy church so much, in part because it was so long.  At a young age, you may have a retention span of fifteen or twenty minutes.  We had, we had ministers who would pray for, (laughter) for ten minutes during the service.  I mean, not the beginning of the service, or the end of the service, in the middle of the service.  Reverend Moore [ph.] would start praying and he'd get down on one knee and he would really, old he wasn't the pastor, but he was known as Reverend Moore.  And he would pray and pray and pray, and I'd be sitting there wondering when is this gonna end.  But we all attended church.  It wasn't a situation of, well because service is gonna run an hour and forty-five minutes or two hours, you could--where, where my wife and I attend service now, if you're very young, they have a program during church where adults supervise the kids, and they are doing things of their interest, which makes sense.  But when I was growing up, if you came to church, you were with your--after Sunday school, you were with, you were with your parents (laughter) the rest of the day.  So I, and I do remember the services and at the beginning, I don't remember ser- church never really started right at eleven [o'clock].  It might have started at 11:03, 11:05, 11:08.  There was no hang up about starting on eleven.  And it, it would normally run, coming on towards one o'clock, I would say.  In, in the Presbyterian church, twenty minutes, that's it.  Whereas in the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church, the pastor would preach until he was, or she was through.  And it was a different kind of a mess- well, and I don't mean to get into that.  The church that I attended, was a relatively small church, but it had a history in Wilkinsburg.  It still is a strong church in Wilkinsburg and my brother, Livingstone Johnson, is still a member there.  So you figure, that's eighty-one years.  My mother had gone there when they moved into Wilkinsburg after they were married.  Mom was a member there until she died in 1993.  So you--and she went there in '22 [1922], that's a good seventy years that she was a member.  Dad [Oliver Johnson] had died maybe twenty, fifteen years, twenty years before mom, but he was always a member there.  And they always, they always attended.  We, we the Johnson family always attended.  I would sing in the choir after I had gotten old enough, or I would play trumpet in things that might be coming up.

Speaker 1: Were there any--well, none of you were aspiring ministers, I guess, though?
Speaker 2: I'd say no.  But I, but I would also say that about ten years ago, twelve years ago, I started thinking about the ministry to the point where I was, I was seriously considering attending the Pittsburgh Theological Seminary [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  This is after I had been on their trustee board, and while I'm now on the board at Princeton Seminary [Princeton Theological Seminary, Princeton, New Jersey].  And my thinking was that there were a number of black churches which were without pastors.  And it's worse today than it was then.  And I was thinking that I had gotten through most of my active life, and that's a bad way to put it.  I was at a point in my career where I did not have to worry about money.  I could pastor a black A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church on retirement money or something else.  But what kept me from doing it in my own thinking, and this could be a rationalization, at no point had I experienced what I understood to be a call from God.  I knew that you could go through seminary without having had that call.  I also knew that in the Presbyterian denomination, you could not be ordained, you could not be approved by the presbytery for ordination without speaking to the presbytery about your exp- your journey, which would have to include a call by God to preach or to serve the people.  And I did not--I didn't want to try and invent something or make something up where, whereas I thought about it, I had not been called.  That--so I didn't go to seminary even though I could have afforded it.  And at that point, my schedule was such, I could have done it fairly easily.
Story_ID: 611972
Speaker 1: So when you think back, do you think that most of your own values are, are they largely from the church or from your family?
Speaker 2: From my family.  Role modeling, you might say.  If I have strong integrity, beliefs about honesty, I got that from my father [Oliver Johnson].  Watching my father, and how he was always erec- always talking forthrightly.  Never equivocating.  And if I got good morals, I would have gotten that from my mother [Irene Morris Johnson] and just watching her, and watching her in juxtaposition with other members of the family, if you will.  No, and I think that's probably true of most people.  The values that they have they would have gotten from their home, certainly for many people.  That's not to say the church did not influence me, because it did.  I mentioned--I thought I mentioned that when I was at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], regularly I would walk through Washington Park [Chicago, Illinois] from Cottage Grove [Avenue] over to South Park [South Parkway; Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive] to attend an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church in Chicago [Illinois].  That wasn't because my mother told me I had to go to church, but it was just something that I thought I was supposed to do.  That, you know, you didn't have a complete week unless you had spent Sunday in church.  And I sang in the choir at Coppin chapel [Coppin Memorial A.M.E. Church, Chicago, Illinois] enjoyed that thoroughly. And I think--
Speaker 1: That's a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) I have gown as a Christian through the years.  First at Bethesda church [Bethesda United Presbyterian Church] in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] for about thirty-five years, and now at East Liberty [East Liberty Presbyterian Church, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  It's a, it's a continuing process.  You know, and maybe part of it might be age, but things that I may have done while I was in the [U.S.] military when I was younger, which I would not care to brag about or talk about, I don't think I could do those today.  When I, when I consider the impact that that has on other people.
Story_ID: 611973
Speaker 1: At school now, did you, you started school in Wilkinsburg [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: That's right.  I went completely through the Wilkinsburg public schools.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And are there any--when you were in--well, what was the atmosphere like?  Were you a, you said you were often the only black person in the class?
Speaker 2: I was always the, (laughter) I was always the only black person in class.  I think one thing that came out of it, which I don't discuss a lot, but it, I think, it has applicability today.  I knew what my place was.  That was, you know, in my senior year, or while I was in high, the senior high school, I had served as head of the orchestra.  I had been student leader of the band.  I was president of the a cappella choir.  And when the, when the yearbook was published, there were pictures of eight people in the front of the book who were the leaders of the, that class.  And I was one of those eight.  Which I'd say, given in the class, we had about 300, 312 who graduated.  In that graduation class, there couldn't have been more than four blacks, tops. But I got to be a student leader by knowing my place.  Example, in the band I recall one day, Eleanor Watso [ph.], a very nice fine majorette came and sat on my lap.  We were in our band uniforms.  And that was a traumatic experience for me, at least it was an experience in which I became tense, because I knew that white women weren't supposed to sit on black men's laps.  All right?  And, at least, that's what I thought (laughter).  And because I thought that, I was just waiting for her to get off of my lap even though I knew she was just kidding around, if you will.  I never attended or tried to attend any of the dances at Wilkinsburg High School [Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania].  I had been asked to leave a bowling party in eighth grade because I was black.  And that was a disappointment for me, something which I--I don't raise it, I'll raise it in this context, but I don't talk about it.  But the mere fact that I could not attend a eighth grade party with my classmates [at Wilkinsburg Junior High School, Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania], and as far as I'm aware, the school district never had a follow up, no one ever came to me and said, "Justin [HistoryMaker Justin Johnson], I'm sorry that happened."
Speaker 1: This is eighth grade.  This was after eight years in the school?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  There wasn't any problem between me and my classmates.  It was the school--it was the arcade bowling alley, big guy.  Well, when I say big guy, you know, I'm an eighth grader, I'm looking up and he's telling me I'll have to leave.  I left.  There wasn't any question about that.  So that I remember.  But, when I say, "I knew my place," I was always careful not to touch white women.  I was, I was careful not to kid with them, if you will, in a way you might just kiddingly say things to anybody around you.  I don't want to say that my mother [Irene Morris Johnson] had threatened me or anything that--for me to be that way, but that's the way I was.
Story_ID: 611974
Speaker 1: And I really believe that being able to get to the point of coming out of high school [Wilkinsburg High School, Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania], being thought of as a student leader, in part was because I hadn't done some of those things which my natural person--and see, I can compare this to my son, Bill [William Johnson].  Where Bill had a job here in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] at a, at a bank, and he was a teller.  There were white girls about his age who were tellers, and Bill, I would say, made the mistake of trying to pursue one of these girls and asking her to go out to lunch with him.  And I know Bill, so I, I can pretty well say he wasn't trying to get in her pants.  He just wanted to go to lunch with her.  He had gone to Westminster College [New Wilmington, Pennsylvania], which is a predominantly white Presbyterian school here in Pennsylvania.  But as a result of that, she went to her boss, her manager, and Bill lost his job.  I'm not sure what the language was that she would have used, but he was seen as bothering her, interrupting her, not doing his work.  You following me?  And as far as Bill told me, he was just asking her would she go to lunch, and he did it more than once.  And I--at that time I told him, "Bill, no matter what, no matter how old you get, when all is said and done, you're still a nigger.  And as far as the society's concerned, you're always going to be a nigger."  And that's something which I understood from the get go.  I'm going a little bit afield now, but when I look at this whole business with Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama], they wanna talk about, "Why hasn't he reached, why hasn't he gone beyond 50 percent?"  And, but then you hear these stories about, has he been presumptuous.  Okay?  Rather than being the presumptive Democratic candidate, has he been presumptuous?  What they're, what they're meaning, but they're not saying, is, "Is he being an uppity nigger?  Is he beginning to act too much," (laughter), "like a white candidate?"  And if he doesn't win, it's not gonna be because he's inexperienced, he's not gonna win 'cause he's a nigger.  But they won't say that on the TV to put it where people can deal with it.  I've gone afar, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But I, I believe that.  And I believe--well, see I can remember my president judge rubbing my head for good luck.  Now, you, you figure, when I went on the bench in 1980, how old did I have to be, forty-seven say?  More than that, well, whatever.  So when he's rubbing my head, I'm not a child.  And he didn't say he was rubbing my head for good luck, but I'm the only one whose head he was rubbing, you know.  And there may have only been, one or two or three other people who were aware of that background.  And, and maybe I was being paranoid, I don't think so.  But this Italian presiding judge had just grown up understanding that, you know, if you want good luck, rub the coon's head.  And here I am a judge, and he's rubbing my head.  Now, I don't make an issue of that because I know my place.
Speaker 2: You're describing a difficult situation that you have to negotiate with.
Speaker 1: Difficult except when it happens from time to time, you adjust to it, if you understand what I'm trying to say.  And in other words, it's not a one time occurrence in a lifetime.  You come up with those sort of-- when I tried to get into the [U.S.] Air Force, when I withdrew from law school [University of Chicago Law School, Chicago, Illinois] after less than a full quarter, because I was immature.  I had just gotten out of college [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], immediately joined law school in the summer, wasn't ready, so I withdrew.  I says, "I'll go into the Air Force and earn money to get back to school."  And there was a doctor at Sampson Air Force Base in New York who said that I had flat feet and a heart murmur, which would prevent me from being an aviation cadet.  I could have gone in as a lowly grunt.  I wanted to fly.  So I got my father's [Oliver Johnson] stationery, prepared a letter, which he signed to our congressperson, Bill Moorhead [William S. Moorhead], Congressmen Moorhead.  That letter went to the Air, to the Air Force, and all of a sudden, was able to join the aviation cadets.  I, I will always believe that he had me with flat feet, because I was a nigger.  And he didn't want me as part of the, of the United States Air Force.  So those, those things happened.  But if, if you dwell on them (laughter), rather than going ahead, then you're, you're not gonna get very far.
Story_ID: 611975
Speaker 1: Now, were there any teachers in school, or, well, who were your--yeah (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I had one teacher in school whom I really--two.  Two.  Really loved and admired.  One was Gwen Mothersbaugh who was a counselor in the high school [Wilkinsburg High School, Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania].  And I'll go to the end and then come back.  When she was in a nursing home in Wilkinsburg [Pennsylvania], coincidentally, maybe fifteen years ago, she would have been up in years, needless to say.  Florence [Johnson's wife, Florence Lester Johnson] and I went to visit her, and she remembered me.  And I'll always remember her because, as I remembered, Gwen Mothersbaugh was one of very few people in the high school who saw me as an individual, and who saw that I had potential.  And she may have come to me to apologize about my not going to the dance.  She may have, I, I know that it was clear to me she saw me differently than other members of the faculty, and I'll always remember her as being a genuine person.  And I certainly wouldn't have gone to the nursing home to see her if she'd just been another person.  And the other person in high school was Irma Hamilton who was my Latin teacher.  I had, I had three years of Latin in high school, two years of Spanish.  It was Mrs. Hamilton who encouraged me to apply to the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  Had she not done that, I probably would have matriculated at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] where both my father [Oliver Johnson] and my brother, Livingstone [Livingstone Johnson], had gone.  And I, I don't want to be misunderstood as saying that that wouldn't have been a good education, but certainly the opportunity to go to Chicago, which, on an academic scholarship, my parents wouldn't have had that kind of money.  But the opportunity to go to Chicago, was something that, everybody doesn't get that chance, and I'm just fortunate.  I'm happy that I had that chance to go to a school where you could meet people from around the country, and from other countries, who were primarily occupied with trying to get a good education, or trying to have some fun.  But it was, it was more the development of their individual potentials, which may not have been true (laughter) at Howard University.
Story_ID: 611976
Speaker 1: Did you ever consider, I know you were in the band and the chorus--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) chorus you said too?  And you had--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I wasn't that good.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I, I, I was good enough to get into to, what do you call, regional bands.  In other words, I, I played trumpet in high school [Wilkinsburg High School, Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania], and I remember being selected for a regional band, which had been instrumentalists from maybe eighteen different school districts.  But I, I wasn't first chair.  You know, you could be the sixth trumpet player (laughter).  There's a difference between being sixth and first chair.  So that I was never that great a musician.
Speaker 1: What kind of music did, was played in the home when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: In the home?  Good question.  I almost have to qualify it this way.  We did not have recording machines or turn tables or anything.  I think the first turn table I can think of, was my brother, Livingstone [Livingstone Johnson], having one at Harvard--Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  So that the music we would have gotten at home was on the radio.  It would have been gospel or religious music on Sunday.  I'm not--I'd have to say probably not much music otherwise.  Well, that cuts both ways.  You know, we weren't hearing the bad music, but we weren't hearing the good music.  I do remember that when I got to Chicago [Illinois], I began to hear classical music and develop a taste for it, which I had not had before I left home.  Under circumstances where many of these kids at Chicago were coming from New York [New York], Boston [Massachusetts], different places.  They were bringing their record collections with them, which gave me an opportunity to borrow those discs, you know, and play them in my room.  That's where I learned about Dvorak [Antonin Dvorak] and Beethoven [Ludwig van Beethoven], and, and Brahms [Johannes Brahms] after I got to the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was popular culture music big in your home when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Not that I remember.  If, if I understand the question--my grandchildren, they all, they all have their own little players and they'll be listening to this, and well, they're getting older now.  But they would be listening to bebop and rap.
Speaker 1: Hip hop, I guess?
Speaker 2: Regularly hip hop.  Well, we didn't have that when I was growing up.  As I say, it was either on the radio, or we didn't have it.  I don't know that my mother [Irene Morris Johnson] would have permitted that kind of music (laughter).
Story_ID: 611977
Speaker 1: Did you like the movies and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  I enjoyed Westerns.  In those days, as I remember, we could go to a Saturday--well, we could go to a Saturday matinee in downtown Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].  Now I could be wrong, but I think we paid not more than seventy-five cents.  In those days, I'm talking about the early '40s [1940s], maybe the late '30s [1930s].  And we would hear Ted on clarinet.  Ted--I'm blanking.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm trying to think too.
Speaker 2: Jimmy Durante, these people would come to the Stanley Theater [Benedum Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], and they would put on a show, if you will, and then you'd be able to watch a movie, and you'd have organ playing and everything.  All that for seventy-five cents on a Saturday afternoon.  Ted Lewis, Ted Lewis.  "Is everybody happy?"
Speaker 1: That's right.  "Is everybody happy?"
Speaker 2: And then right in Wilkinsburg [Pennsylvania] we had two theaters, the Warner [Warner Theatre] and the State [State Theater], and there for no more than a quarter, it may have been fifteen cents, we'd go by Aunt Precious' [Johnson's paternal aunt, Precious Johnson] home, which was closer to downtown Wilkinsburg. She'd give us enough money to go to the theater, and then we would just walk around the corner from her house to the, to the Warner, or to the State, or up around on Penn Avenue.  And in those days, I don't know whether they had it when you were growing up, you'd not only get the cartoon, but you'd get the 'Warner-Pathe News,' and then you might get some previews, (laughter) and then you'd get the two--double feature.  One would be a Western, and one would be something else.  So you could, your afternoon, Saturday afternoon, was well consumed (laughter) just going to the theater.
Story_ID: 611978
Speaker 1: Now, did, did black folks sit anywhere they wanted in the theater?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I--that never occurred to me.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, there weren't that many black folks.  And I'm trying to think if the--apart from that bowling alley--oh, now let me be clear.  I was gonna say apart from the bowling alley there was no disres- that's not true.  We knew as young Johnson children, that you could go into Isaly's [Isaly's LLC].  Now, this is a large, ice cream dairy, which is no longer in business.  They, they sold the name, so someone else is using the Isoly's name, but we had two Isaly's in Wilkinsburg [Pennsylvania], and they were throughout Alleghany County [Pennsylvania].  You could buy deli stuff in there and ice cream, et cetera.  We knew that we could go in there and order a sandwich.  But if you ordered a sandwich, we weren't supposed to, or we weren't allowed to, sit in one of the chairs in Isaly's.  We would have to take it out.  You could go in and order as much ice cream or chip chopped ham, or whatever that you wanted, but you weren't allowed to sit there.  There was a Harvey's Restaurant [ph.] one block from the high school [Wilkinsburg High School, Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania].  I knew that I could not go into Harvey's to eat.  Maybe I could go in to say--I couldn't go in there for any reason, Harvey's Restaurant.  Growing up, if I went down to visit my dad [Oliver Johnson] where my dad took me in town to his office, and we wanted lunch, we went up into the Hill District [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] to Dimling's [Dimling's Candy Company] or another little tea room, a black tea room, because there was no place in downtown Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].  Now, this would have been through the '30s [1930s], I want to say through the '40s [1940s], certainly through the '40s [1940s].  You could not eat in downtown Pittsburgh.  Donahoe's [Donahoe's Market and Cafeteria], which was like a dairy, where you could buy butter, they'd cut out a--you could buy two pounds of butter in a big slice, you know, 'cause they had tubs of butter.  They had tubs of fish and everything fresh.  Donahoe's, they had a very nice restaurant on the second floor, only blacks couldn't eat there.  There was no place in downtown Pittsburgh that I'm aware of, that blacks could--that was before fast food places.  The restaurants, don't even think about it.
Story_ID: 611979
Speaker 1: Now, when you were in high school [Wilkinsburg High School, Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania], in your senior year, you said you had good counseling, good advice from teachers and counseling, which is just opposite of what we usually hear.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But what were your aspirations?  Did you, what did you think you were going to do?
Speaker 2: At, at that time, I have to say, I wasn't particularly--I didn't know what I was going to be.  So Chicago [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] really was a good fit.  My father [Oliver Johnson], when he would take his sons around, Livingstone [Livingstone Johnson] and myself, he would always hit us firmly on the back and introduce us.  "These are my sons, they're going to be lawyers," you know.  And he always did that.  "They're gonna be attorneys, they're gonna be lawyers."  And I think that may have--you're sometimes at an age where you're trying to react negatively to whatever your parents say.  So I may have gone through that.  But coming--how typ- well, I guess the correct answer, the one thing I remember wanting to be growing up, was a tap dancer, because Billy Robinson--
Speaker 1: Bill, yeah, Bojangles.
Speaker 2: Bill "Bojangles" Robinson was big back in the late '30s [1930s].  And I would, we had linoleum in our kitchen, and I'd be out there calling myself tap dancing.  That is the one thing that I wanted to be.   Looking back, that's ridiculous (laughter).  Well, number one, I didn't have the perseverance, or, or the talent to really develop that way.  But I would say, it was not until I had--and I had gone to law school [University of Chicago Law School, Chicago, Illinois] almost because, you know, well that's the inevitable thing.  You know, you have to succeed in a family where you had to be something.  So I went to law school and pulled out.  It probably wasn't until I had been an attorney for some years; eight, ten, fifteen years that I really said, "Hey, this is where I belong," or "This is good," or "I can do something here.  I'm, I'm comfortable here."
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you weren't really even (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I wasn't gung ho--
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.
Speaker 2: --about being a lawyer, no.
Story_ID: 611980
Speaker 1: So what did you--
Speaker 2: Oh, another thing, and I gotta say this, I was--I had given thought to being a commercial airline pilot.  Because in the [U.S.] Air Force, I had over thirty-two hundred hours in multiengine aircraft in the 377, which is the same aircraft which Pan American [Pan American World Airways] was using across the Pacific Ocean, the Stratocruiser [Boeing 377 Stratocruiser].  And so just on ability and experience and background, I should have been able to get a job with Pan AM or United [United Airlines] in no sweat.  When I came out of the Air Force in 1959 that was not to be.  Not only in the Air Force--not only in commercial, 'cause I'd tried to raise that question on the West Coast and it didn't go anywhere.  Coming home from Travis Air Force Base, Fairfield, California, driving home, I came through Chicago [Illinois], I had my form five with me, the record of all my flying.  I left that record with a reserve station at O'Hare field [Chicago O'Hare International Airport, Chicago, Illinois].  O'Hare was pretty much a brand new field then.  It wasn't, it may not have even been a commercial field at that point.  But I left it there, and again, with all the flying experience I had, there shouldn't have been any problem about my being in that reserve unit as I, when I came back to law school [University of Chicago Law School, Chicago, Illinois].  But I never heard from them.  And that had to be race, had to be.  When I got back to begin practice in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], nineteen sixty--I began in '62 [1962].  I'll never forget in 1963 [1963], a couple of officers from the greater Pittsburgh reserve station [Pittsburgh Air Reserve Station] came by the law office and invited me to come into the reserves.  And on that invitation, I went out and I served in the reserves here in Pittsburgh for ten years, until my brother [Livingstone Johnson] went on the bench and I felt I did not have the time to both be in the reserves and handle the responsibilities in the office.  So that was a good experience in Pittsburgh, and I was able to get into Vietnam twice flying out of Greater Pittsburgh airport [Greater Pittsburgh International Airport; Pittsburgh International Airport, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], during the Vietnam War.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were a reservist (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly.  A United States Air Force active reserve [U.S. Air Force Reserve].
Story_ID: 611981
Speaker 1: After high school [Wilkinsburg High School, Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania], you go to the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yes, sir.
Speaker 1: Then after that, you go to the [U.S.] Air Force?
Speaker 2: And then back to Chicago [University of Chicago Law School, Chicago, Illinois] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And come back for law school?  So let's go through that period of time.  Tell us about the University of Chicago after high school graduation.  Now, you start, this is in 19--
Speaker 2: Fifty-one [1951].
Speaker 1: Fifty-one [1951], okay.
Speaker 2: I will always remember when I arrived on campus.  Figure I was a high school graduate at the age of eighteen.  I hit campus, and here I've got classmates who were fourteen, fifteen, sixteen years of age.  Some of whom had not graduated from high school, but who had demonstrated their ability to handle college work.  Ed Gottesman [Edward Gottesman], I remember from New York [New York], fourteen years of age.  There was a gentleman from Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] here, his name may escape me.  He was sixteen from somewhere over near Penn Hills [Pennsylvania].  But I was, as an eighteen year old, I was one of the older students in the entering class at the University of Chicago.  But it was, it was an awakening for me on social matters, because for the first time, I was interacting with blacks of similar backgrounds.  Let me put it that way.  I had gone to a couple of parties here in Wilkinsburg [Pennsylvania], but it was always with my mother [Irene Morris Johnson] cautioning me, you know, about being home, and one thing or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now--
Story_ID: 611982
Speaker 1: Okay.  That--this just kind of raises a question.  Now, when you guys were being raise- I mean, your parents, they really didn't--did they socialize with other blacks of, in the professional, professional community (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They did.  They certainly did.
Speaker 1: And so, but you didn't have much contact with the youth of those?
Speaker 2: That's exactly right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We would have only--we would have had contact with the children of the professionals with whom my parents, professionals or others with whom my parents were having social interaction.  And that was not a very large group.  I think it's fair to say that my father [Oliver Johnson], although I think he may have been in the Masons.  He, he was in the Masons, but he was not in things like the Loendi Club.  Which it was, is the club, it was the club back in the '50s [1950s], '40s [1940s], '50s [1950s] and '60s [1960s] where black professionals had their private little club.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: L-O-E-N-D-I.  The Loendi Club.  Dad wasn't a member there.  It's fair to say, most of the other professional blacks in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] were.  But, dad's life throughout, I would say, was centered around his family, his wife [Irene Morris Johnson], and his children.  So he never made a big deal about going out.  I don't even know if he went to dances after he got married and began raising his family.
Speaker 1: Now, what, just one more thing about the Loendi--
Speaker 2: Loendi, yeah.
Speaker 1: Loendi Club.  What does, what does Loendi mean?  Or what does it stand for?
Speaker 2: I don't have the faintest idea.  It, it was a club, if you were a black doctor, if you were a black attorney, I don't know whether they had ministers there, but the mucky mucks, if I can put it that way, within the African American community, they were members of the Loendi Club.  It was a male, a male club, very private, and that's, that's--
Speaker 1: Okay.  I just wanted to get a fix on it.
Story_ID: 611983
Speaker 1: But okay, University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], these young geniuses are there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But, yeah.  I, I, I think an awakening that I had was in trying to learn how to date.  I had had, I had had one date before I left Wilkinsburg [Pennsylvania] to go to school.  And my mother [Irene Morris Johnson] had arranged that.  And I, I don't say that with any shame (laughter).  I didn't know girls that my mother would have been happy with my dating.  So she had talked to her best friend, Helen Gowens [ph.], and Helen Gowens had a next door neighbor who was related to someone down in, I think, Brownsville, PA [Brownsville, Pennsylvania] or Monongahela Hill [sic. Monongahela, Pennsylvania], which would be forty-five miles from here.  Vina Lee Crable [ph.], I'll say her name because she was just--I thought she was just gorgeous.  Beautiful girl.  And I remember taking her to the Civic Light Opera [Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera] here in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].  And at that time, I didn't even, I was afraid to put my arm around her shoulders, (laughter) you know.  But when I got to Chicago [Illinois], not that I rapidly became a social being, but I then was meeting black young women, black young men, who were socializing.  One memory I'll always retain in my freshman year, Charlain Booze [ph.] had asked me would I take her, would I be her escort at a dance at the South Parkway Ballroom [sic. Parkway Ballroom, Chicago, Illinois].  And I said, yes, somewhat naively.  Well, I told her, "I don't have, I don't have a tux."  She said, "Well, my father has a tux."  So I took her to this dance at the South--at the Parkway Ballroom, wearing her father's tux.  I remember buying her this gorgeous orchid, and I also remember when I got to the dance, Charlain was one of the few girls that had an orchid.  It was because I didn't realize that in the black community at that time, I was doing what white kids would have done in high school.  And they weren't doing that.  And I remember, the guy came to our table to order drinks, I had never been drinking.  So I--Charlain or some of the other women had ordered a sloe gin fizz.  So I ordered a sloe gin fizz, which was fine for me.  I think the other guys at the table were wondering, "Where'd this dork come from?" (Laughter) But that was my first formal date, freshman at the University of Chicago, Parkway Ballroom.  Beautiful girl, I mean, maybe a couple of years older than me, but a really nice person who just wanted an escort.  She wasn't looking to--she wasn't looking to me as a boyfriend.  And I, I may not have realized that at the time.  I was so busy, concerned about my own inadequacies.  But over a period of three years then, and I can't say, I guess I'd better say I don't remember dating so much as being at events where all the black kids were coming together.  Either on campus or off campus.  You know, if I would hear about a party that some one of the students was having who lived there, I might go to that party.  I don't remember having a girlfriend as such.  I probably didn't have a girlfriend until I started dating Florence [Johnson's wife, Florence Lester Johnson], after I got out of the [U.S.] Air Force.  And by girlfriend, I mean someone you take out more than once (laughter).  And I never thought of that, about that before, but I think that's probably true.
Story_ID: 611984
Speaker 1: I began to awaken, I would say, in Chicago [Illinois] about a number of things.  On political issues, at Chicago [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], you're either very liberal or you get off campus.  So, I remember we were having this demonstration, and we were gonna close down the university, and we're gonna--and I recall we went into the dean's office, whose name was Stroser [ph.] at the time.  A rotund guy, fairly quiet, and for some reason, I was one of the representatives, I don't--
Speaker 2: What was the name of the organization?  What was that?  Was it a black organization? Or this is a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, no, no.  It would have been a college, possibly, the--oh, my, there, oh my.  There were several political organizations there.
Speaker 2: It really has a history there.  I mean, I think James Farmer was there at one time, that was before your time.
Speaker 1: That I don't remember.
Speaker 2: That was before your time.
Speaker 1: But the upshot of this was, (laughter) this was at a time when they were succeeding at Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California], they would demonstrate and really give the administration some fits.  Well, we went into Stroser's office, and said what we were gonna do, and he pretty much just sat there, "Okay, fine."  We left (laughter) and the university kept going on, I mean, that was a maturing experience. I was beginning to learn where the power was (laughter).  And looking back, probably at the time, I was very frustrated by that, but Stroser took the right, you know, as I've become more conservative.  He did what was right.  He kept that university going, where as I say, Berkeley was having some problems.
Story_ID: 611985
Speaker 1: I remember a gentleman who had come back from the war [Korean War], Fred Hubbard had taken me to a--we had double dated.  And when I use that word, very loosely.  He took me to a place where there were two women whom I did not know at all.  They weren't university people.  And I imagine, pretty much, they were just people that you'd give them a half a bottle, and I remember being somewhat apprehensive and scared.  And I--one of them took out a knife or something, (laughter) and Fred and I, I'm, I'm telling you what I remember.  Fred and I left, and if he had taken me there to--where there's some verb for when you move from virginity to non-virgin.  If he took me there for that purpose, that didn't work (laughter).  But that, that was one of my experiences in college [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yeah, Fred Hubbard was involved in a political life in Chicago [Illinois] and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You bet your life.
Speaker 2: He got in some trouble, I think at a certain point.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was sad.
Speaker 2: He was married to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He came back from Korea.
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Arnette Hubbard, yeah.
Speaker 1: What's her name?
Speaker 2: Arnette Hubbard.
Speaker 1: Exactly.  Well, she's a lawyer.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  A very good one in Chicago.
Speaker 1: And was very active in the National Bar Association.  Arnette Joyner [sic. Arnette Rhinehart Hubbard], wasn't it?  What was her, what was her maiden name?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Arnette I remember, but before she married Fred, she had been active, and probably is still active in--
Speaker 2: Yeah she is, yeah.
Speaker 1: --the national board.  Which is all the black lawyers across the United States.  I believe she may have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She's a judge now.  She's now retiring.
Speaker 1: I didn't know that.  I didn't know that.  But no, I knew that Fred had gotten into some problems, financial as I remember.  As I remember, you know, it wasn't--there are crimes and there are crimes.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And he was just into fraud and that sort of thing.  Which if you'll forgive me, it's, it's different from molesting young children or, or homicide.  But I don't know whether he served any time, but I do recall that put a taint on what he was doing.
Story_ID: 611986
Speaker 1: We had a--not we, the black kids would use an apartment, it was 5530, as I recall.  Hyde Pa- 5530 Drexel.  And again, I was too immature and too naive to know what the potentials were at that address (laughter).  But, but I would go there.  That, that's where the blacks would congregate for late parties and listening to music, one thing or another.  And I think my wife, Florence [Florence Lester Johnson], had told me she'd been by there.  Not when we were together or--when I tried to, I'm sure she didn't do anything more than I did.  But it was an address where blacks, who were in some way associated with the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  They would know that rather than go into the Reynolds Club on campus, you'd go to 5530 Drexel where the blacks were hanging out.
Story_ID: 611987
Speaker 1: What about your academic life at the, at the university?
Speaker 2: I'm ashamed to say I did not spend the correct amount of time in class.  I never failed a course, I passed everything I needed to pass, I graduated in three years, but I have distinct memories of playing chess or playing cards late at night, and then missing classes the next morning.  In retrospect, Chicago [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] was not a place where they took attendance, you know, as far as they were concerned you'd take the, they had comprehensive exams coming in, they had comprehensive exams at the end of a course.  And they were all multiple choice, pretty much.  So you took the multiple choice test, and you either passed it, or, or you flunked it.  I probably would have been no better than a low B student.  I don't e- I don't remember any of my grades.  I graduated when I was supposed to graduate.  I was not a star (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So three years is a, so did you go to school in the summer as well?
Speaker 2: No.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
Speaker 1: Yeah, three years, it seems to me--
Speaker 2: Well, no, that was because they had entrance exams.  Some of those fourteen years olds and fifteen year olds were getting out in less than three years.  You'd take the exam coming in and they would say, they had three major areas of, instruction.  Social sciences, physical sciences, and let's see.  Social, physical, history was off on its own.  Why am I missing the third?  Well, there were fourteen courses.  You would take exams in all fourteen, in the three or four areas.  Depending on your performance, as you took that course in high school, you may be able to opt out is the verb they used.  You may be able to opt out of Soc I, and then have to take Soc II and Soc III.  So right away that's a course off.  Same in physical sciences, so I ended up only having to take courses which could be completed in three years, because I placed out of several courses.  And you could of, in theory, placed out of the whole program and gone right into graduate school.  That wasn't me.  I wasn't that bright.  Nowhere near that bright.
Speaker 1: That's a unique situation in college life (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't think it would be that now.  There--I think Johns Hopkins [Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland] undergraduate may have been doing that at the same time.  I don't, I don't know that Chicago still has placement exams.  I don't know that they do.  I haven't, I haven't tried to follow it.
Speaker 1: Now, were there any black professors there at all when you were--
Speaker 2: Undergrad?  Let me think.  I don't remember any.  I don't remember any.  I know in the law school they, they had one, Ming, does the name Bob Ming [William Robert Ming, Jr.] hit you?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Bob Ming, right.
Speaker 2: He was on the faculty.  Now, he may have been what they called an adjunct professor.  I'm not sure about that.  Bob Ming was the one black, and he was not there when I came back off of active duty.  He was no longer on the faculty, and I'm trying--when I was in the law school [University of Chicago Law School, Chicago, Illinois], there were no black professors in the law school.  They, I'd hope that they would have maybe one or two now, I just, don't hold to me to that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your major in undergraduate school was?
Speaker 2: You didn't have majors at Chicago.  They had fourteen courses, it was a general liberal arts program.  Anyone who came out had the same A.B.  There was no way you could specialize because you either you took the course or you had passed, you had placed out of it.
Speaker 1: Hm.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And again, they, they've probably moved somewhat away from that.  I think you now may be able to get a degree in political science, or economics, or one thing or another in the undergraduate school.
Speaker 1: Now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This was Bob Hutchins, Robert Maynard Hutchins, had the main idea that great, the Great Book education.
Story_ID: 611988
Speaker 1: Now, you said, you met your wife [Florence Lester Johnson] at, at--
Speaker 2: I met her the--two days before I began reentry into the University of Chicago Law School [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that's much later than this.
Speaker 2: Well, well, yes.  It would be three years.  It would be three years after my undergraduate experience.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, let's go right into the [U.S.] Air Force.  Now, how did you choose, I mean, what made you decide (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Why did I go into the Air Force after I withdrew from school?  I thought about where could I make some money to get back in school, and without knowing a lot about what the opportunities were.  I knew that if I--
Speaker 1: Now, wait a minute.  Maybe I'm missing something.  Now, did you graduate from the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] undergrad?  Be- be--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I--
Speaker 1: --before you went into the Air Force?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  I had graduated and had gotten my A.B.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That, that following Monday, I entered the Chicago law school because Chicago was a four quarter institution.  And I saw myself coming right out of law school [sic. undergraduate], going right into law school, getting out of law school quick and then practicing law.  I hadn't allowed for the fact that I had been fooling around so much in college, having a good time.  I was not a, I was not geared for the discipline of law school, the need to study (laughter).  Because you're moving from multiple choice exams which you can sort of get through.  You're moving to exams by professors where they're looking to see whether you had captured the essence of the course by your writing.  I wasn't ready for that.  I, again I wasn't attending class, having forgotten I'd moved from undergrad to law school, and a light bulb went on my head, and I said, "If you stay in here until you have to take those final exams, you're not gonna pass."  And I wouldn't have.  So I withdrew during that first quarter of law school.  Right after getting my undergraduate degree, went into the [U.S.] military, I was in the military for three, three years and four months, and a couple of--twenty-five days.  And then, getting out in February, on my way home from the military came through Chicago [Illinois].  Dean Lucas [Jo Desha Lucas] said I could return as an entering student.  Then I came back to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] and had to wait until September.
Story_ID: 611989
Speaker 1: Now, you told us about some of the struggles of becoming a pilot in the [U.S.] Air Force.  You know, you told us about some of the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Being admitted to the program.
Speaker 1: Yeah, being admitted to--
Speaker 2: I had, I had trouble learning to fly, but fortunately, Richard Allen [ph.], my instructor pilot in, in basic, he was very patient with me and brought me along under circumstances where a more difficult instructor pilot could have said--could have washed me out.  In other words, he, he stayed with me when he, in fact, he would tell me, "Johnson [HistoryMaker Justin Johnson], you're holding that stick," you know, on, on a single engine plane, you have a stick.  He says, "You're moving that stick like it's a bucket of shit."  You know, which meant I wasn't flying very well.  Or he, he'd say, "Force landing."  And, you know, in training, if the eye piece says force landing, he's sitting behind you, he pulls off the power.  So you're sitting up there at maybe eighteen hundred feet, and you gotta look around and find a place to put that Piper Cub down.  You're over farmland, but you gotta pick a piece of farmland big enough to--and I don't know that I ever really passed that (laughter).  But, but he never told me, "Johnson, you've flunked."  That is to say, coming through primary base, primary pilot training, I really wasn't very good, but they let me go into multiengine basic training.  And there I began to hone some flying skills.  So that my experience, I think, was the flip side of trying to keep me out because I was black.  I think my instructor, Allen, kept me in, maybe, possibly because he wanted a black to succeed.  Under circumstances where I thought I wouldn't fly in that group very good.
Speaker 1: Now, in the early '50s [1950s], now we've interviewed some other pilots.  [HistoryMaker] Jim Tilmon, [HistoryMaker] Ed Dwight, I guess they were being trained around the same time you were.  Did, did, did you know any other black pilots anywhere?  Being trained?
Speaker 2: There were no black pilots at Honda [sic. Hondo Air Base, Texas], where I did my PA-18 Piper [Piper PA-18 Super Cub] and T-6 [North American Aviation T-6 Texan] training.  When I got to multiengine school, I frankly don't remember any black pilots.  When I was on active duty, there was at least one black pilot at Hickam Air Force Base [Hawaii] flying C-124s [Douglas C-124 Globemaster II], which was essentially the same, it, it had the same engine.  The R- R-4360 engine.  But that was the dumbo with the big nose in the front of, cargo master, double deck, four engine aircraft.  I remember that one black pilot there.  And three or four black navigators.  But in terms of my running into black pilots on my trips between California and Japan, if I didn't run into that one black pilot, I don't remember any other black pilots out in, out in the Pacific.
Speaker 1: Now, what base did you fly out of?
Speaker 2: I was flying out of Travis Air Force Base in California, and I started my three year tour at Hickam Air Force Base in Honolulu [Hawaii].  And I was proud of that because my flying had improved to the point where when I was coming out of basic training at Vance Air Force Base [Oklahoma],  I was able to select my, I was able to select the base to which I would be assigned.  And the, and the, in other words, I was, I was high enough up coming out of multiengine school, that I picked Hickam Air Force Base and the C-97 [Boeing C-97 Stratofreighter], which I'm sure would have been a plum for other people.
Story_ID: 611990
Speaker 1: Any interesting stories about your days flying in the [U.S.] Air Force?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) (Pause) I'd almost want to say that it was interesting because it was nothing traumatic about it.  And what I'm doing with your permission, I'm comparing my situation, which my brother, Livingstone [Livingstone Johnson], who had been in the Korean War between, I'm gonna say 1950, 1950, 1951, and say, 1953 or '54 [1954].  He had been in the Air Force, and I've heard him say, not to me, but as he might be speaking to other groups.  Just within the last year, I found out that he had not been promoted when he should have been after, I think, twenty-five missions over enemy territory.  You're supposed to move from second lieutenant to first lieutenant.  A commander of his wing had come onto the base and had asked and had offered Livy a ride, I guess, from the, from the--where the aircraft would parked back to the sleeping area.  And in going back, the colonel had asked Livy, why was he still a second lieutenant.  And Livy didn't say, "Because I'm black."  But he said, I think his answer was something like, "Well, I don't know.  They have never given me an answer."  So the wing commander had to clear that up.  In other words, that was a situation where he had deliberately had been kept from promotion simply because he was black.  And he would tell stories of how, I think he's, I remember one story where he was talking about a guy who had been very racist, openly.  And he was aware of it, and for some reason, this guy went on a mission that Livy was supposed to have gone on.  He didn't come back.  I don't think my brother meant to mean that if you're a racist you're gonna get killed.  But that was a situation where someone else solved that problem.  Livy, I think, on active duty, in that early period of the '50s [1950s], probably experienced discrimination more than those few examples than I'm giving you.  I didn't experience any of that.  The only overt discrimination that I remember experiencing in the [U.S.] military was not by the military themselves.  But when I arrived at Hickam Air Force Base [Hawaii] for my first permanent duty station out of West Palm Beach [Florida], where I'd learned how to fly a four engine aircraft, Hickam had very luxurious officers' quarters.  But you had to be at least a bird colonel to live on the base.  At least, most of them were one and two star generals.  So right away, when I checked in, they told me I, I could stay in the BOQs [bachelor officer quarters] until I found a place to live, which would have been a short span of time.  So I went to a real estate agent, or I went to somebody.  Whether I was referred to him or looked them up in the paper.  This lady was taking me around to look at places where I could stay as a bachelor, furnished, unfurnished, I don't remember.  But what she was showing me in Hicka- in Honolulu [Hawaii], was like a pigsty as far as I was concerned.  I, I had trouble trying to understand.  Wait, I've got a uniform on.  I'm, I'm a second lieutenant in the United States Air Force, and you think I'm gonna live like this?
Story_ID: 611991
Speaker 1: So any other military experiences that you think--
Speaker 2: I remember one or two--
Speaker 1: Oh, you said, I'm sorry.  While we were changing the tape, you were telling me you did get a place in a lanai.  You said that it was on the right (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  It was on Pacific Heights Road in Honolulu [Hawaii], and people who may be familiar with that community, unless it's changed drastically, this was a very exclusive area of upper class people.  The property that we were on should have been a single family resort, if you will.  We only had the main floor, but I'll always remember on the main floor, inside there was this, I'm gonna call it another lanai or an open area, where there was a stone wall, with the water flowing down the wall like a waterfall in a pond.  This is inside the house.  It was big enough that four people all had their private space, plus a large kitchen, plus a large living area, plus the bathroom with a shower in it, and I enjoyed it thoroughly.  It was, it was more than I needed as a bachelor, but--
Speaker 1: Now, this is with some other pilots who were--?
Speaker 2: One, no the, one--I was the only pilot.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: One was the base photographer, Richard Allsbrooke [ph.], one was with the OSI, the Office of Strategic Information [sic. Office of Strategic Influence], and the other was a navigator, Bud Paisley [ph.].  So there were the four of us on this floor.  But the point I wanted to make, the whole time I was there, I never had any problem.  After I left, I learned, I was told that the people who were renting out the property had warned them that they had better not let another black come into that area.  And I can understand that because it was, above where we were living, it was all very rich.  Below was not in any way poor.  But I mean, it would be like Sewickley, if you will.  Sewickley Heights here in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], in terms of the economic level of the neighborhood.  And as I say, you--we could look out of our apartment, right down into Punchbowl [Punchbowl Crater], and beyond Punchbowl, we could look out to Waikiki Beach.  So the, if you were just paying for the view, it was a nice place to live.  But that was, that was the piece of discrimination that never hit me, though I heard that it was there after I left.  The only discrimination I had run into was trying to find living quarters where they were treating me there the same way they would treat people in Pittsburgh at that time.  There was this philosophy, blacks were supposed to live here, Jewish people lived here.
Story_ID: 611992
Speaker 1: Okay, so you come back to Chicago [Illinois] in 19--
Speaker 2: Fifty-nine [1959].
Speaker 1: Fifty-nine [1959]?  Okay.
Speaker 2: September of '59 [1959].
Speaker 1: All right.  And had things changed in Chicago very much?  Noticeably when you got back?  Or were they about the same?
Speaker 2: I would, I would--they would be about, they would have been about the same.  I was only out of the city four years, five years total.  They were pretty much the same.  And then two, my, my focus at that point is law school [University of Chicago Law School, Chicago, Illinois].  At that point when I got out of the [U.S.] military--no I wasn't married.  I was still a bachelor.  But my focus was, okay, you messed up the first time, (laughter) let's get serious and graduate from law school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is--now, did you meet your, you met your wife before you graduated, right?
Speaker 2: I met her the second day that I was back in town.  Or maybe the third day.  You figure, law school starts on a Monday, I had come in maybe Friday night or Saturday morning to my space, my apartment.  And a good friend, Mitchell Watkins came by the apartment at night, asked--I had known him from college.  We'd run hurdles together.  And he said, "Would you like to go to a party?"  And I said, "Sure, I mean, I don't have anything to do 'til Monday."  And he took me to this party and it was, it was a regular basement party.  I'm sure you've been to many in Chicago.  Nice party, lot of people there.  And I remember Florence [Florence Lester Johnson] entered the room where I was, and I noticed her and she noticed me, and sometime later, Florence would say she decided right then and there that that was for her, that I was gonna be her husband.  I hadn't decided that, but I think I may have mentioned to you that on our first date, I said that I couldn't get married until I finished my education, and we got married the following June.  A year and a half before I finished my education.  And I've never regretted it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So she was with me, well, she was dating with me even before we married on campus.  So the undergrad--I had a dormitory within the Burton Judson Courts.  At 60th [Street] and Ellis [Avenue], a group of eight residence houses within one complex, two quadrangles.  We had Mead, I had Mead House [Dodd Mead House], and I would bring Flo on campus as my date, so they got to know her even before we married.  And when we married, I was still able to remain on campus, I think for another year.  So it was only in our--my last year at law school that we had a apartment off campus.
Story_ID: 611993
Speaker 1: Did you have children by that time, or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We had children nine months after we got married (laughter).  No, Bill [William Johnson] was born March 11th of '61 [1961], and we got married--no, no.  He, March 11, '62 [1962], March 11, '62 [1962].  We were married June 25, 1961.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think that is about nine months. (Laughter) I'll never forget Florence [Florence Lester Johnson] had been talking about our--changing our hospital plan as we were making plans for the wedding. I'm saying no, that's not a problem.  Don't worry about that.  Well, it was a problem because our first child came along within a framework by the time I had established the new health insurance, and then you count forward from there, Bill was born before that time which is a, which was, he was born outside of coverage for pregnancy.  The pregnancy was fine.  Florence will tell the story about how when I took her, we were on 60th Street.  You may remember Billings [Albert Merritt Billings Hospital, Chicago, Illinois] and Lying-in Hospital [Lying-in Hospital and Dispensary, Chicago, Illinois] were on 59th [Street].  When I took her over to the hospital, then I wanted to--I wanted them to assure me that she was ready to deliver before I would let her leave the incoming area, because I knew I'd have to pay for it.  And maybe I was sort of rambunctious, having been in the [U.S.] Air Force, but after we talked back and forth, and talked back and forth, I think Flo finally told them, "Look, I better get upstairs."  And she had the baby within an hour or two, I think, after her admission.
Story_ID: 611994
Speaker 1: You had to get a--you started working at the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service] you were telling me (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah over the Christmas season.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Before that, I had a job by virtue of my being a resident head that paid for my room and board.  Okay?  That wasn't a problem.  I also would try and pick up small jobs, dragging the tennis courts or things like that around campus.  Little things at seventy-five, eighty, eight cents an hour.  When I had this opportunity at the post office that would have been real money.  And I could work ninety hours every two weeks.  So I started that as soon as they were putting on people for this Christmas rush.  It may have been late November, early December.  And I would ride the elevated [elevated train] from the South Side into the downtown postal area, and back pretty much every day.  And it--and I finally got a job right on the South Side, with the post office where I was assisting a guy who was--Christmas packages and that sort of thing.  But I found that I was pretty tired in the morning after I had been working.  I think my shift would have been, what, maybe six [o'clock]?  Six in the evening 'til two in the morning, or three in the morning, something like that, or maybe eight in the evening 'til four in the morning, whatever.  I wasn't getting that much sleep.  I was having trouble in law school.  I went to the Dean, Dean Edward Levi [Edward H. Levi], asked him could I turn in a paper late.  I was in a seminar on the Robinson Patman Act [Robinson Patman Act of 1936] in law school and Levi let me know in no uncertain terms, that wasn't gonna happen. (Laughter) It wasn't a long conference.  I'd caught him coming down the hallway in the law school, tried to tell him what my situation was, and then he told me, he told me what my situation was.  He said, "Mr. Johnson [HistoryMaker Justin Johnson], you can either attend law school, or you can go ahead and work at the post office.  That's your decision." (Laughter) So I, I think I continued working at the post office as best I could.  But I didn't get any extension on the paper, and I had to push it through as best I could.  I think, I think I passed the course.  But the consideration I was looking for, I didn't get, and in retrospect, he handled that perfectly.  That's exactly what he should have said.
Speaker 1: Now, you said that the only thing you really had nightmares about, are that--is that period of time when that pressure was on you to feed your family--
Speaker 2: Not so much nightmares where you wake up screaming, but nightmares, dreams where I would be very uncomfortable.  And I'd be so anxious that I wasn't going to graduate, I wasn't gonna graduate.  You know, one of these dreams where I know I have to go to the registrar's office to find out what my grades are to see if I need to go back to school, and in the dream, I can't get to the registrar's office.  And I've had dreams where I went back to school because I had failed my last year.  Maybe I tied this with Carnegie Mellon [Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], I'm not sure.  But I went back to school because I needed one or two or three more credits, and then I wasn't getting those credits so that I could graduate.  Or I went back to school and I got the credits, but I'm still in school and at the end of the year, I'm not sure whether I got a diploma.  I've had, I've had quite a few of those dreams, which don't make any sense because (laughter) every time I wake up, I'm saying, "Well, wait a minute.  You know, I've already been practicing law.  I've been a judge all these years.  I think I have the degree" (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  But it was a traumatic period.  I guess it made a big impression on you.
Speaker 2: It did, it did.  But as I say, Dean Levi was right.  What I wasn't doing, and I've tried to caution young people about this.  What I wasn't doing was putting all of my energy towards absorbing as much education as I could.  Not only from my professors, but from my fellow students.  Karl Llewellyn, a name that wouldn't necessarily mean anything to you.  He was the founder of the realist, realist school of law in the United States.  He was a professor at the University of Chicago [University of Chicago Law School, Chicago, Illinois], and he had a theory that there is a percolation process involved in, in the education where you're just BSing if you will, or talking back and forth with your fellow students outside of class is part of the process.  I never had that.  Because as soon as the class bell would ring, I'm running out of the law school to go ahead and take care of some nickel and dime job.  And I'll stay on that job until know I have to get back to my next class.  Or I might miss a class, so I can make a little money.  That was a mistake.  I should have borrowed whatever money may have been necessary to stay in school and focused on developing relationships, if you will, with my fellow students 'cause I wasn't doing that.  Just back and forth about the various classes.  I wasn't doing that.  Maybe going to talk to my professors between classes.  I wasn't doing any of that.  I was doing the bare minimum to get out of law school, and putting the emphasis on money where it should have been on education.  That was a big mistake.

Speaker 1: When you graduated, it was nineteen fifty--sixty--
Speaker 2: I--my last class was December '61 [1961].  My class graduated May of '62 [1962].  I left there, I was out of Chicago [Illinois], I would say, within six hours of my having attended my last class with a U-Haul van behind the car with all of our worldly goods.
Speaker 1: Headed for?  Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Pittsburgh.  Pittsburgh.  Because that's the only place where I had a job offer.  I had gone to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] to interview with--oh, my, husband and wife black judges in Philadelphia.  And I'm black, I'm block, I'm blocking--
Speaker 1: The Alexanders?
Speaker 2: Uh, that's--
Speaker 1: Raymond Pace Alexander?
Speaker 2: Exactly.  Raymond Pace Alexander.  I, I believe it was Allison Dunham, a property professor at Chicago [University of Chicago Law School, Chicago, Illinois] got me an interview with Judge Alexander.  And I remember I went over there--I didn't have any relatives or anything in Philadelphia, but maybe I took a Greyhound bus, or I somehow got to Philadelphia, and went to his office.  He gave me an interview.  In retrospect, I really shouldn't have been thinking that he would hire me, because when you consider the number of blacks who would have been coming out of Philadelphia law schools, even if it was only ten or eleven, I'm sure one of those would have been a, appropriate law clerk for Judge Alexander.  So I had the interview, I very much appreciated Allison Dunham having arranged that for me, but that was the only interview I had, and no other offers, so I was ready to come back and practice with my father [Oliver Johnson] and my brother [Livingstone Johnson], knowing that it was there for me.
Story_ID: 611996
Speaker 1: So you came back in '62 [1962]?  Now, this--did Johnson, no, this is Johnson, Johnson and Johnson at this point (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Johnson and Johnson and Johnson.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So now, the Civil Rights Movement was cranking up at that point at a, at a pretty high rate all around the country (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's true.
Speaker 1: Was, was Johnson, well was the firm involved in civil rights activities?
Speaker 2: Not, not as a firm, not as a firm.  My brother, Judge Livingstone Johnson, who then was just an attorney, was very active in what in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] was UN- UNPC.  The United Negro Protest Committee.  This was a group, which in the late '50s [1950s], early '60s [1960s] was bringing pressure on the downtown merchants like Florsheim shoes [Florsheim Shoe Company; Florsheim Shoes, Inc.], Gimbels [Gimbel Brothers], Duquesne Light Company.  Pressure was being brought on them to hire blacks in their, in their jobs.  And Livy was the chief negotiator with Duquesne Light, which as a result of the demonstrations and negotiations, did change its policies.  And for a number of years, my brother Livy had an excellent relationship with the president of Duquesne Light because of their having been on the other sides of the table and fighting this thing, and, and getting it moving along.  He also had been the chief mediator on some things around the U.S. Steel [United States Steel Corporation] building, which was going up and they didn't have enough, they weren't hiring crafts people, electricians, plumbers, brick layers, on that job.  Part of the, part of the reason being that the, the blacks have been kept out of those crafts.  Out of those trades.  And hadn't gone through the schools.
Story_ID: 611997
Speaker 1: But you're right. This was a time, and both Livy [Johnson's brother, Livingstone Johnson] and I at that time, were rep- were representing defendants who had been arrested because they were demonstrating.  And I'll always remember, you know, being recently out of law school [University of Chicago Law School, Chicago, Illinois], you go before the district justice, what you might call a magistrate, and he's got maybe ten or twelve people in front of him who've done nothing more than demonstrating, and the magistrate would say, "Okay, I'll find you not guilty and put you on probation for two years," or something like that.  (Laughter) Now you can't find someone not guilty and put them on probation.  At the same time, we were in a situation where if he hadn't found them not guilty, if he, if he had sent the case into court, that would have been just more money and more time on the defendant and tying up the time of the lawyers.  So I can better appreciate today him doing something that you can't do.  I wish I could remember his name.  Eventually, he did time for the bad way, for the illegal way, in which he had been running his agenda.  Not on these civil rights matters necessarily, on everything else.  He was just a bad magistrate.  But no, we, both my brother and I were involved in the Civil Rights Movement.  In that way as practitioners, my brother was involved as a mediator, as a--not as a mediator, I'm sorry.  He was involved as the chief negotiator for those blacks in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] who were moving ahead as the United Negro Protest Committee.  And this would have been, this would have been '63 [1963], '64 [1964], '65 [1965], yeah.
Speaker 2: So you think that that particular--what was the judge's name that was--
Speaker 1: Chapas [John W. Chapas].  I, I wasn't comfortable--now, when I was, when I was intentionally saying magistrate or justice of the peace. You've got magistrates who decide whether a matter should go to court, then you've got your first trial level, okay?  So John Chapas, C-H-A-P-A-S, was a magistrate or a justice of the peace, if you will, who had the power to send something on to court on a felony, or to assess a fine on summary matters.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He had the power to send them to court on either a misdemeanor or a felony.  Disorderly conduct would be a summary offense which he could handle in his court room.
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And the protestors were never there because they had hit an officer, or be- you understand what I'm saying?  If they had alleged that they had hit an officer, they would have been charged with a felony and probably would have been held for court.  From my standpoint, they were held, they were there because they were, they were demonstrating and they refused to demonstrate.  Which is constitutionally protected.  But it wasn't at that time.
Speaker 2: Okay.  There was a discrimination against the, the demonstrators (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Exactly.  There was discrimination against anybody who was, who was protesting.  Including some whites.
Speaker 2: It didn't seem like it would be quite a, well--
Speaker 1: Be careful what you're saying now.  Why wasn't the city up in arms?
Speaker 2: No, I guess I'm trying to understand, why--I guess if the judge, he was just trying to keep those cases from going to court so there would be no legal precedent established or something?
Speaker 1: I think he called him (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Because you can't--
Speaker 1: No, part of his problem was, most people of that level are police oriented.  Most people.  So he was trying to do something so he wouldn't offend the police under circumstances where he knew that what was going on, it was just a bunch of--from a legal standpoint, it was a bunch of foolishness, shouldn't even be before him.  So by finding them not guilty, but putting them on probation, by putting them on probation, he's keeping the police officers happy, by finding them not guilty, they're keeping a clear record.
Speaker 2: But doesn't it also like curtail their ability to demonstrate if they, if they demonstrated, don't they violate probation or something like that?
Speaker 1: I don't think that ever came up.  I don't think, I don't think that came up.  It's a good point.  You, you're right.  I don't remember a matter where anyone was brought back because they had violated, because it was a hokum judgment anyways (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) And so if they came back, it still wouldn't become a process.
Speaker 1: You mentioned the Detroit [Michigan], well, the Detroit mayor who spent a night in jail, he was under clear instructions that he could not leave the jurisdiction.  And when the facts were established that he had left the jurisdiction, that judge really didn't have much choice because up to that point, everybody who had done the same thing, they had spent some time in jail.  Had he not put the Detroit mayor in jail, at least over in--well, he had to put him in until an upper, until the appellate court immediately got rid of it.  But that's something which, had he done it, he would have been looked askance by a lot of people in the community because it was a double standard, if you will.
Speaker 2: We're talking about the recent jailing of Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick, the mayor of Detroit.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That, that happened just before we, I mean, a couple of days before we started this interview (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, right.
Speaker 2: Right.  Okay.
Story_ID: 611998
Speaker 1: Livy [Livingstone Johnson], my brother has been recognized, not only in the civil rights matters, but more recently, over the last fifteen years, I would say, on, on matters of, of gender rights, women's rights.  He has received a Susan B. Anthony Award from the Alleghany County Bar Association [sic. Women's Bar Association of Western Pennsylvania].  He has received a distinguished justice award from the Pennsylvania Bar Association.  He has been recognized, certainly here in Alleghany County [Pennsylvania], and I think statewide for what he's done on behalf of women lawyers, white and black, as they faced discrimination in the courts.
Speaker 2: And your brother, Livingstone, went to--
Speaker 1: Michigan Law [University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor, Michigan] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) University of Michigan
Speaker 1: Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] as an undergrad.
Speaker 2: Howard
Speaker 1: He came back from, from Korea and attended Michigan Law as a vet.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So to that--
Speaker 2: Did that, did you learn a lot from him?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  Oh, very definitely.  We're, we're, we're two different individuals.  I, I think it's fair to say that I'm still learning from him.  And part of that is better understanding why he is as outspoken as he is, and he is more outspoken than I am.  And I think his present day intensity about justice reflects some of the injustices which he received both while attending public school as a youngster and while in the [U.S.] military.  Just within the past three weeks, I've heard him mention--I had gone to some sort of a public affair, and ran into a--oh, Florence [Johnson's wife, Florence Lester Johnson] and I had gone to a play downtown, and in the lobby, we had run into a couple who it turns out the husband was related to a Mr. Ball [ph.], who had been the swimming instructor in Wilkinsburg [Pennsylvania] back in the '40s [1940s].  A nephew or something like that.  And when I told Livy that I had met this person who was related to Mr. Ball, because they wanted me to, the couple wanted me to remind my brother that I had seen them.  Livy then recounted to me how as a Boy Scout back in the '40s [1940s], he was not permitted to swim at the Wilkinsburg Junior High School [Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania], which was the only pool in the town, as I recall.  With the other boy scouts.  He was not permitted to move towards becoming an Eagle Scout because--and you needed swimming and lifesaving to be a Boy Scout.  Mr. Ball saw to it that Livy got private instruction if you will, in that gym because the school officials would not permit blacks and whites to be in the water at the same time.  And that's something I, if I'd heard it before, I had forgotten it.  But I know my brother was the first black to receive an Eagle Scout award within East Boroughs Council, which is the local groups of Boy Scouts.  And that wouldn't have happened if Mr. Ball hadn't insisted--well, when I say hadn't insisted, he didn't insist that Livy swim with the whites, but he took more of his time to see that Livy was instructed the same as the whites.
Story_ID: 611999
Speaker 1: Well, tell us a little bit more about the United Negro--
Speaker 2: Protest Committee?
Speaker 1: --Protest Committee, yeah.
Speaker 2: I remember Jim McCoy [James McCoy, Jr.] who was with the United Steelworkers.  Very quiet man, but very, very firm in his beliefs, he was on that committee.  Byrd R. Brown [Byrd Brown], B-Y-R-D, Byrd Brown, the son of Judge Homer S. Brown, and a graduate of the Yale Law School [New Haven, Connecticut].  He was very active and was at that time, he was the president of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] here in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], and he was active on the United Negro Protest Committee.  LeRoy Patrick, a black pastor at Bethesda Presbyterian Church [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  He would have been one of the stalwarts there as I recall.  I probably have a button somewhere around here, a UNPC green button.  Their, their goal, their, their reason for existing was the discrimination which existed in Pittsburgh, primarily in the downtown area where people, where blacks weren't being employed.  It was, basically, trying to get some jobs, and it worked.  Because right after that period, there were blacks working at Florsheim shoes [Florsheim Shoe Company; Florsheim Shoes, Inc.], which had a shop right there at the corner of Fifth [Avenue] and Smithfield [Street], which was the busiest intersection in downtown Pittsburgh.
Speaker 1: So, so what would have been the heyday of that group, from start to, I guess to--
Speaker 2: There I'm not gonna--I'd better be careful because--
Speaker 1: Did they start in the '50s [1950s], you think?  Or the--
Speaker 2: I don't remember that going on before I got out of law school [University of Chicago Law School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not, not that they were waiting.  I didn't play that big of a role, but I do remember when Livy [Johnson's brother, Livingstone Johnson] was selected to speak for the group, so the heyday had to be, I'm going to say '62 [1962], '63 [1963]--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --sixty-four [1964].
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, and let, let me say this.  Let me say this.  King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated in '68 [1968], right?  And things weren't all that great in Pittsburgh, so Livy would have been involved in trying to tamp things down, if you will.  And trying to reach accommodations, both slightly before '68 [1968] and, and even thereafter.
Speaker 1: Were there riots here in '68 [1968]?
Speaker 2: Oh, you bet your life.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, when you say, riots, no.  They just tore up the Hill District [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A riot, well, that would be a riot.  That would be a riot.
Speaker 1: Yeah. A rebellion, maybe, or--
Speaker 2: It wasn't, it wasn't blacks fighting whites.  It was blacks destroying the businesses in the black community.
Speaker 1: In rage.
Speaker 2: So you could ride down Centre Avenue, you could ride down Centre Avenue right now, and you would find businesses that have never been put back together.
