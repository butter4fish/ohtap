Speaker 1: All right.  Okay, before we get into depth, there are five "People Magazine-ish" type questions I am compelled to ask you.  And the first--and they just require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: The first one is, sir, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Grape leaves.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Back to the food, that's an unusual kind of choice, grape leaves, actually?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: It's a Middle Eastern dish.  It's made in grape leaves, lamb or ground beef, chicken, a lot of seasoning.  It takes about five hours to make.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And it's shaped like a grape leaf.  You wrap around, it looks like a finger.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It's not just the leaves off the vine or--
Speaker 2: No, not, well, right.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  Now, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Summer, when it's warm.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, do you have a favorite vacation destination?

Speaker 1: All right.  Now, third, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: No.
Story_ID: 90202
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let me ask you about the, your family tree, I guess, well, really about the origins of your family, your family history.  How far can you go back?
Speaker 2: My brother did a very comprehensive research on my family in terms of documentation and trees and this kind of thing.  I can really go back to about 1820, 1810, okay.  On my mother's [Harriette Patricia Rogers] side, the family is from Greenville, South Carolina, okay.  On my father's side, it's from Birmingham [Alabama].  And now on my father's [Harold Rogers] side, my great-great-great grandmother had 12 kids--three, two of the kids by a white man, and the other 10 by three different black men.  However, she named all 12 of them after the white man, Rogers, even though the other 10 were by these three different black men, okay.  So that's how the Rogers name came down and so forth.  We keep in contact with some of them, yes.  But on my mother's side, from Green-, the Greenville side, the family is related to--well, to a well-known personality from Greenville, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: And the--
Speaker 2: And you should know that.
Speaker 1: Who is that personality?
Speaker 2: [HM Reverend] Jesse Jackson, Sr., okay.
Speaker 1: Oh--I see, okay.
Speaker 2: We--my family grew up and so forth, so.  In any case, I mean, that's in brief, the development.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Are there any stories other than the story of your great-grandmother to come down from the slavery period that you can remember that you've been told about?
Speaker 2: My, my grandfather on my mother's side, his last name was Warwick [ph.], okay, from Kentucky.  And I always thought he was white, but the way he looked, okay, but my relatives tell me he was black.  And a very funny thing happened.  He used to work at a poultry factory in Cleveland [Ohio], okay.  And I remembered one time he went out--well, I went out to get the, his weekly check.  And they said "We have no black people working at this plant."  And I said, "Well, I come to pick up the check for Warwick, John Warwick."  And they said, "We have no black people."  So what happened was they started looking into his background.  So I made a mistake (laughter).  I shouldn't have said that.  But, to me, it didn't matter, but he looked, in terms of how he looked, he looked white to me, okay.  Now, there's been that kind of stuff in my family--mixing and, and so forth, okay, on both sides really--when you come down to it if you do.  But actual stories, no.  If, if I could point to one story, I couldn't, okay, so I can't answer that particular question.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's a story in and of itself.
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Story_ID: 90203
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about your father.  Can you give us his name and spell it for us, and give us his date and place of birth?
Speaker 2: There's--it was Alabama, Birmingham, Alabama.  Harold Rogers, H-A-R-O-L-D R-O-G-E-R-S.  Now, date of birth, he don't even know.  He's dead.  But, as you know, a lot of black people at that time never had birth certificates.  So I think it was sometime in the '20's [1920s].  I'm not quite sure, okay.  He worked at a--in Cleveland [Ohio].  He was a very tall person, about 6'7", very big, in term, physically.  He was good in sports, very good in sports, football, and basketball.  But when he married my mother [Harriette Patricia Rogers], he began to work in a plant in Cleveland that heated steel, okay.  He worked there 35, 40 years, all his life, he never missed a day.  He died in the plant from--they said gas, okay, but he never missed a day.  He left--my mother did all, all of the raising.  All he did was the discipline, okay.  So if you needed a whipping, then he would do the whipping.  But he, of course, I have three brothers.  One died so two are living.  He--well, he was always, he was always there, but he was always working basically.  We would go on vacations and so forth, but basically, it was--for him, it was a work situation.  And he always worked, and he loved it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was his personality like?
Speaker 2: He didn't say too much, he didn't say too much.  He didn't really, he really didn't relate to us too much, to tell you the truth.  I mean he was always there.  I mean, he provided the discipline.  He took us on vacations.  But he was kinda, he was quiet, okay, didn't say too much.  Everything was left to my mother, that kind of situation.  And he encouraged us but all, you know, he worked all the time.
Speaker 1: Uh-hum.  Now did he, did he have a chance to go to college or any kind of sports, that stuff?
Speaker 2: No, he never graduated from high school.  My mother did.  In fact, she went, she got a A.A. degree [associate's] or so forth, a two-year school.  She wanted to go further but she had more kids so she didn't go.  Towards the end of her life, the last five or six years, she did.  She went back and took a couple of courses and so forth.
Speaker 1: Now--
Story_ID: 90204
Speaker 1: Now, what was your mother's name?  Can you--
Speaker 2: Harriette.
Speaker 1: --give us her full name and spell it for us and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's H-A-R-R-I-E-T-T-E, Patricia Rogers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what's her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Same situation, I don't know.  The birth place was Greenville, South Carolina, but the actual birthdate, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what was your mother like and what did she do?
Speaker 2: She worked as a demonstrator in a store--in other words, demonstrating products and this kind of thing.  She did that most of her life and just a housewife.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What, what was her personality like?
Speaker 2: Well, she was the one that really encouraged me to go South during the Civil Rights Movement.  So I went briefly when I got out of high school to join SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee], and then I came back to the North, or, or Chicago [Illinois], I mean, Cleveland [Ohio], in terms of going to the Peace Corps.  But she is the one that really--she is, she was the most conscious one--put it that way--she was the most conscious and most aware of the whole Civil Rights thing.
Speaker 1: You said when you she took care of most of the household business--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --and everything and okay.  And she was, I guess, the primary person (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah, she did, she did everything in the house, correct, uh-hum.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Story_ID: 90205
Speaker 1: Now, did, did she [his mother, Harriette Patricia Rogers] en-, encourage you all, education wise, to get a good education?  Did she push that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: I was a very poor student, okay.  Both in my junior high days and high school, I was a very poor student.  In fact, when I graduated from high school [John Adams High School in Cleveland, Ohio], I was--I had a class of 720 something in the class.  I graduated with about--I was about 715.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had practically all "F's", okay, out of high school.  But in Ohio, by state law, at that time, a four-year institution had to, had to take you into a college, as long as you had a high school diploma, but they could delay it.  They didn't have to take you when you wanted to go, so they delayed it for me, okay.  So I eventually got into Kent State [University in Kent, Ohio], okay.
Speaker 1: Now, now I want to go back to the childhood.  We skipped over quite a bit here.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: Now, I asked about your mother's influence when you, when you were young.
Speaker 2: Well, I was coming to this.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay, I'm sorry then, go ahead.
Speaker 2: Right.  Through even when I was getting bad grades and did not do well in, in high school, she would go over the homework with me.  She would encourage me.  My father [Harold Rogers] did nothing of that, okay.  But she would, so she greatly encouraged me.  And, and because of that, that's the reason I went to college.  I mean, to me, I didn't want to go.  She gave me three choices, college, the [U.S.] Army, or work.  I was not going to work and I was not going to go into the white man's Army.  That's the way I looked at it.  So the only alternative was college, even though my grades--so the first year I got in college, everything was remedial 'cause my grades were so bad.  Everything was remedial, okay, but she stood by me and, yes, she was my major influence.  When I graduated from Kent State, I graduated with a 3.8 GPA and I had ten offers for a graduate school.  All I simply done was look at who go pay me the most money.
Speaker 1: Uh-hum.
Speaker 2: And University of Chicago [Illinois] paid me the most money, so I ended up in Chicago.  But in terms of educational influence, it was my mother.  But the other thing about the educational influence was by that time, I was participating in the Civil Rights Movement.  And that, too, that was also educational influence in terms of the, the need to study and so forth.  So, yes, my mother played a big role.  My father, no, not in terms of education or that, but he provided other kinds of support.  So, I mean, it's not the hating him or nothing like that.  It's just that it was my mother, in terms of the educational aspect.
Story_ID: 90206
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now can, can you give us an idea--what side of Cleveland [Ohio] did you grow up in?
Speaker 2: East side.
Speaker 1: East side?
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.  I went to--first, I went to Doan Elementary School.  I went to--why, I ended up from high school, John Adams [High School].  It's a school, but I went to Glenville before that, but I ended up at John Adams.  That's where I graduated from.
Speaker 1: What, what kind of a young fellow were you when you were growing up?  Can, can you give us a--well, can you give us a--
Speaker 2: Oh, simple, gangs--
Speaker 1: Uh--
Speaker 2: --okay, gangs.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Every Friday we would have a fight--interesting, just women, gangs and women, essentially.  I mean, the drug scene was not a big thing in my time, okay.  It was just hanging out with your crew, the gangs.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, I want you to reflect back if you can.  Give us an idea of some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up, you know (unclear) (simultaneous).  What, what--
Speaker 2: Well, most of the time we grew up in a house, okay, so there were barbeques, picnics.  My mother [Harriette Patricia Rogers] liked to entertain and so there were always people over eating something and so forth.  Then, as I said, I had three other brothers.  So it, it was what, for me, at least in the teenage years, it was one of recklessness, one of staying out late.  Just, I'm not concerned about anything until I went South.  But in the Cleveland situation, I mean, there was always food.  My mother liked to cook, so we didn't grow up in poverty and so on.  So that's essentially it.
Speaker 1: So your father had a good factory job and what they call a good job in those days?
Speaker 2: And those are, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And so were, were your brothers basically involved in a lot, a lot of street activity, too, or--
Speaker 2: Yes and no.
Story_ID: 90207
Speaker 1: I think one of the biggest awakenings to me, in terms of just getting out of that [gang] life kind of thing, was when I got drafted at eighteen [1960] because as you know, there was a draft at that time, as opposed to--now it was a volunteer Army.  I had had enough of a couple of months in the South to make me aware that I was against this Vietnam War.  So when I was drafted at eighteen, it was right after I came out of school [John Adams High School in Cleveland, Ohio].  I, you know, they would, they'd call you to come take your physical, okay.  I went to the American Friends Service Committee who at that time was opposed to the war and so forth.  And they said to me, if you go this, if you're going to be a conscientious objector, what we could do to you is try to get you out physically.  So they sent me to a doctor and right, the day before I was go take my physical, this doctor injected something into me, okay.  To this day, I still don't know what it is.  So when I went to take my physical, and I produce urine, it was all blood, okay, all blood.  They called me back six times.  I went to the doctor six more times--same thing.  So they de-, declared me physically unfit, 4-F or 4-Y [sic, 4-F], or something like that, "physically unfit."  Fine, okay, that experience woke me up to a lot about reality, all right.  So, that was an education to me.  That was a real education to me also, all right, but still, I'm saying my mother [Harriette Patricia Rogers] was the main person to push me towards education.
Story_ID: 90208
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now you told us that your mother [Harriette Patricia Rogers] gave you a political education in some ways.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: And you, you alluded to some things she said.  Can, can, can you talk about more specifically about the kind of thing--what did you she go through that made her what she was?
Speaker 2: You know, she was watching--well, she used to watch the [Civil Rights Movement] demonstrations in the early '60's [1960s], late '50's [1950s] on television.  And she said, you know, you aren't doing nothing.  You're in the gangs--you're doing nothing with your life.  Why don't you go down to your cousins in Alabama, okay.  I told you, since I wasn't go to school and I wasn't going to work (laughter), I wasn't go to college, what did I have to lose?  So she sent me to a cousin down in Alabama, who in turn hooked me up with SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee], okay.  So I got into my first demonstration.
Speaker 1: Now is this in Birmingham [Alabama] itself or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, where my father's [Harold Rogers] people were.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.  That really was--see, this is right before I went into the Peace Corps, okay, 'cause I didn't go into the Peace Corps until about after about six months in SNCC.  Then I went--came back to Cleveland [Ohio], and then went into the Peace Corps, okay.
Speaker 1: So Birmingham, as soon as 19-, right after high school, you're talking about '61 [1961], I guess, '60 [1960], '61 [1961]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, around '60 [1960], '61 [1961], yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And, and by that, that time, Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] hadn't gone down there yet, but--
Speaker 2: No, but you had SNCC.
Speaker 1: Yeah, [HM Reverend] Fred Shuttlesworth was there doing something like that (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Right, you had, you had SNCC down there.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: And we were doing civil disobedience kinda stuff, particularly around the stores, okay.  Now, that really--number one, it exposed me to different people who I had never been around, number one.  Secondly, it exposed me to a different city.  It's the first time I ever left Cleveland, okay.  Thirdly, it was young kids my age from the black colleges that had a purpose and I've never seen that before.  I had never seen that before, not in Cleveland, I mean, 'cause just in terms of the people I was messing around with, I had never seen that kind of stuff.  So, that was really an eye opener.  That, those five or six months I was down there was really--and that, that even encouraged me to join the Peace Corps surprisingly.  It just, it encouraged me to join the Peace Corps.
Story_ID: 90209
Speaker 1: Now, okay.  So when you were down there [Birmingham, Alabama] involved in, in the, this was SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]?
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: And, okay.  I mean, well, how did you make a transition from that to the Peace Corps?  I mean (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, the Peace Corps came out with a package.  They would pay for your college education.  They would expunge your military record if you had a seal.  I just told you how I got that, on and so on.  So it looked--and, and then, plus it was an opportunity to travel.  It didn't, it didn't matter where, okay.  I was not concerned 'cause they, they ask--well, at that time, they asked you, do you have a preference?  And I said no, so the second group was Iran.  They sent me to the city of Shiraz in the southern part of Iran.  At Salt Lake, they told you about the Iranian culture.  You learned the language as much as you can, Farsi and so forth.  So I was the only black--I was the first black in the country in the second group.
Speaker 1: Now, did you ever--was there, there a whole of hoops to jump through in terms of qualifications to go?
Speaker 2: No, not really.  I mean, most people were not interested.  You gotta, I mean, you got to remember, when [President John F.] Kennedy started it [March 1, 1961], this was something new.  And most people were not interested in joining the Peace Corps.  No, there's not, so, no, I didn't have to jump through no hoops, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they didn't give you a lot of tests.  They knew and figure out, yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, in terms of reading and writing skills, your adaptability to foreign cultures, but that was pretty simple.  I mean, as at least as I remember then.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would guess that, I mean, just thinking about this that you, you probably had some decent skills if you can get into the Peace Corps.  I, I don't think they would take just anybody, right?
Speaker 2: Well, I assume so, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But you got to remember, it was the early part, I don't want to glorify myself but--
Speaker 1: Sure, but a lot of college graduates are going--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and people that have had--
Speaker 2: Right, right, and I just got out of high school.
Speaker 1: They could report like, you know, do paperwork--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and make observations and report on one thing, so on and so forth.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum, right.
Speaker 1: I mean, to be able to do that, you have to have some, some, you know, basic educational skills--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that your--from what you say about your high school [John Adams High School in Cleveland, Ohio] year, you didn't do well grade-wise, but you, you certainly seemed to have acquired the skills, I guess.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I don't think they would (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, maybe so, yeah.  I, I've never thought about it really, to tell you the truth.
Speaker 1: I don't think I--at a, at a great risk, I think, right.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).  If I was right, if I had a lot more skills or demonstrated in your grades.
Speaker 2: Well, maybe so.
Story_ID: 90210
Speaker 1: How do you feel about it?  Do you think that, that was true when you were in high school [John Adams High School in Cleveland, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: You, you actually had more skill than your grades actually show (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Oh, I never accepted what they said in high school.  I never accepted it at all.  I mean, you know, at that time, they would call blacks dumb that don't have any intelligence.  In fact, when I was in high school, in college [Kent State University in Kent, Ohio], I remember I was in one class, a history class, as a matter of fact, and I got an "A" on a paper.  And the black--white student said, they came up to me, they said, they said, they couldn't believe a black could get an "A" on a paper, all right.  But I never, I had never considered myself inferior or considered, or even thought about what they said.  I mean, that was like the furthest thing in my mind, okay.  So, it didn't bother me, all right.  The actual, you know, the actual time that I felt some real racial prejudice, I spent a number of years in my high school before that in the Boy Scouts, okay.  At one time, me and these three whites went to Kentucky and so forth.  And the first--I was about 12 or 13 or something of this nature.  And I couldn't go into the bathroom.  And that really struck--I couldn't understand why, all right.  I was 12 or 13.  That was my first--aside from Birmingham [Alabama], the first time.  That was my first initial expression or experience with racism because in Cleveland [Ohio], I grew up in an all-black neighborhoods, so we didn't see whites, okay.  I mean, we grew--the Glenville area in Cleveland, then we moved out to John Adams area and so forth, Stockridge, and so forth.  So I never really saw directly racism until I was in the Boy Scouts when we went to Kentucky, okay.  And then, of course, when I went down South, and that's something different.  But I'm talking about growing up, younger, because I grew up in all black, all black areas.
Story_ID: 90211
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, but I just, I just thought there was something there.  I mean, so, so you were in, in high school [John Adams High School in Cleveland, Ohio], basically, you were kind of a rebellious person at some level.  I mean, you didn't really, you didn't have a lot of respect for the educational system.
Speaker 2: Oh, no, not at all, not at all.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Not--or authority or the teachers, not at all, no respect at all.
Speaker 1: Were, were there any teachers or--
Speaker 2: None.
Speaker 1: None that, that had--
Speaker 2: None to (unclear), none.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).  None, okay.
Speaker 2: But now college, that's different.
Story_ID: 90212
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, we, let's go to the Peace Corps first and we can figure this out.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now, now so, so who told you about the Peace Corps?  Did you just, just pick up anything out of the paper (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I was reading the paper, yeah, uh-hum.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  And they said they would pay for your college education.
Speaker 1: So did you enroll from Birmingham [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I'd been down five or six months and then entered the Peace Corps.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: Just, just a mo-, a moment on Birmingham.  Who did you work with in Birmingham?  Any, any significant people we would know now working in SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] in Birmingham in those days?
Speaker 2: No, not really.  I mean, the one that stands out who's dead is Stokely Carmichael, but no.
Speaker 1: He, he was down, down there in '61 [1961] then?
Speaker 2: Uh-hum, uh-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, so I, I didn't know he had gotten started that, that early.
Speaker 2: Right, uh-hum.
Speaker 1: All right, okay, all right.  Well, tell us about the Peace Corps then.  You, you enrolled and you're the first black and you're on your way to Iran to Shiraz (simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, Shiraz is the city in southern Iran.  We were at a--well, my job was to teach English.  Can you believe this (laughter)?  Teaching English, I can barely speak it myself.  And I was roomed with a white racist from Georgia, I mean, an openly racist.  We were the same age, okay.  I mean, he was openly racist.  He wouldn't even tell his parents he was rooming with a black person, you know, he was afraid, okay.  But we became very good friends, okay, became very good friends.
Speaker 1: Now, how did you become friends with a white racist from Georgia?
Speaker 2: Well, well, he, he expressed all of his racism.  And I told him why I don't like white people, okay.  So over time, when you're living together with somebody, you, you know, you're kinda like thrown in, right.  You begin to know a person, all right, you begin to know a reason, so we became very good friends.  But then, what was even more important than that, we didn't have that much to eat, all right.  So, basically, our diet was yogurt, cucumbers, and rice, okay.  That was basically the diet.
Speaker 1: So what--
Speaker 2: So we would get meat maybe once a month--once a week.
Speaker 1: Now, this was supposed to be the new frontier, you know.  They, they couldn't provide any (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: No, but the people were very poor in Shiraz and they were around--very, very poor.
Speaker 1: --and the government didn't provide you all with special packages (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: No, uh-uh, no, no, no, no, no, no, 'cause we were staying in this boarding school, like.
Speaker 1: So you had to eat what the people ate?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, so I learned not to eat.  I mean, when you're talking about cucumbers, yogurt, and rice, I mean, that's, that's what you're talking about, okay.  Your whole ideal of food changes.  So me, and I can't even think of his name now--Georgia, I used to call him Georgia, but that's not his real name, my roommate.  We would share, we were trying to buy food on, on the open market, some meat or something, some eggs, okay.  That kind of solidified our relationship, all right.  So all that racism stuff went out the window, but he still couldn't tell his parents (laughter).  He still couldn't tell his parents that he's rooming with a black person from Cleveland [Ohio].  But that was okay, that was okay.  It was extremely educational.  I mean, the Iranian people were very good, very hospitable, very nice.  It gave me an impression of another culture and how people do things differently.  So I liked my Peace Corps experience.  I liked it very, very much.
Story_ID: 90213
Speaker 1: So, now you're in the Peace Corps and so, how long were you in the Peace Corps?
Speaker 2: Almost two years.
Speaker 1: Almost two years?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I came back on July 27th, I mean, August 27th, 1963, on the day of the march [March on Washington].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now what--can you relate any good Peace Corps stories to, to us, you know, then?
Speaker 2: I think my favorite one, you know, southern Iran is deserty in terms of the climate and so forth.  We were going to the local chief's house when we first arrived.  And it was up in the mountains and I couldn't, I mean, it, it seemed like the truck was going on and on and on.  Anyway, when we got there, everyone was sitting around on pillows, okay.  And they got these round discs, bowls, like thing, with food on them.  And I couldn't believe that this existed 'cause it was hot.  It was in the desert.  And you went into this castle, like kind of thing, fortress, like kind of thing and had all these men sitting around eating.  It was like paradise, it was totally like paradise.  I couldn't believe it.  And you had this fountain outside that had all this fish in it.  I mean, we were up in the mountains in the desert, and this place was--it was a rich person's house.  It was like paradise.  That was just the one thing I, I remember the most.  The students, I remember some of the students at the school.  And I'll get you to the picture and so forth.  I mean, it was spartan life.  It was really spartan life, but I mean I didn't know any better.  So, to me, it was not unbearable, even though it was no running water and no consistent electricity, but it was bearable because the people were so good.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you didn't get sick, did you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, dysentery, diarrhea, oh, yeah, all that.  Well, the government gave me pills and all that kind of stuff.  But some of that, you can't really prevent, particularly if the food is bad or the water is bad.  I mean, you can boil it and all that kind of stuff.  But, yeah, that's it, lost a lot of weight--never regained it.
Speaker 1: So you were bigger before you went in?
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 90214
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so you got out of the Peace Corps in two years [August 27, 1963].
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: And what did you do after the Peace Corps?
Speaker 2: Well, I enrolled back, I enrolled in Kent State College [sic, Kent State University in Kent, Ohio], and then I went to participate with SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] in the South.
Speaker 1: Okay now, you enrolled in college--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: And then you--
Speaker 2: On the summers, I would go with SCLC.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: On breaks, I would go with SCLC in the South, and then come back and go to school.
Speaker 1: So you went with SCLC, not SNCC?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, they--I think in those days, too, it was kind of split, wasn't it?  They were kind of splitting their--
Speaker 2: Well, SNCC, at the beginning to end to have differences on the whole issue of peaceful demonstrations, okay.  So, yes, that was a problem and so on.  But still, I mean, SCLC was still the main organization because I mean even that, even with SCLC, I became attracted to the Panthers [Black Panther Party] even then, okay, 'cause the Panthers started about '64 [1964, sic, 1966], all right.  Well, in '65 [1965], I was back down South again on this voter rights thing.  But then, I was in the Panthers--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --because I even had questions about peaceful demonstrations, okay.  'Cause, you know, it, it took a lot, it took a lot of self-discipline for people to participate peacefully 'cause most people naturally--just about everybody naturally have a reaction is to strike back.  Some cop will knock you upside your head and drag you along.  Your natural inclination--so even I was having questions about that.
Speaker 1: So did you get back in '64 [1964]?
Speaker 2: No, '63 [1963].
Speaker 1: '63 [1963], you got back to the states in '63 [1963]?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 90215
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, so did--were, were you in Birmingham when they had the--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --the big march when [HM Reverend James] Bevel led the children on the street [Birmingham Children's Crusade from May 2 to May 5, 1963]??
Speaker 2: Uh-hum. [sic, Rogers was still in the Peace Corps during the Children's Crusade].   The children's march.
Speaker 1: Yeah, tell us about that a little bit.  Where were you at that time?
Speaker 2: I was just in a march I mean, I went to jail, and the trouble, 'cause I was really practically a kid myself and so forth.  But my consciousness was, was being developed--put it that way, okay.  I mean, Iran had done something in terms of international level but, no, I participated in several marches.  I stayed with some relatives in the city, 'cause you couldn't get into the hotel 'cause stuff was, you know (unclear).  And then, I participated in a march, march for voter rights.  And as a matter of fact, I was in the third group to get over the bridge, the Pettus Bridge [Selma to Montgomery marches].  And when that happened in the third group, 'cause the first two groups were beaten back.  And the third group--
Speaker 1: And, let's just, let's just stay with a second.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: It was a famous incident, the march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge.  They were the first voter rights demonstration.  As they were coming across, cross the bridge, the police sealed, sealed off both, both ends, right?  Am I right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I mean, it, it started really on a person, a black person who had been arrested--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --for another, that had nothing to do with the voter rights kind of stuff.  So it, it really, it didn't start out that way, okay.  It ended up that way (laughter), but it didn't start out that way.  And then, when I--we got across the bridge, a cop busted me upside my head.  And since the hospitals were segregated, they took me to a nurse.  She, she did the best she could, but it left a scar, okay, a keloid.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It left a scar.
Speaker 1: Now, this is, this is the--you said this is a third march 'cause after the first march, people were beaten so badly.
Speaker 2: No, no, no, I'm talking about the same day.
Speaker 1: The same--
Speaker 2: Right, I'm not talking about--
Speaker 1: That first march or--
Speaker 2: Right, right.  I, I'm talking about the same day in terms of people trying to get across the bridge.  That's what I'm talking about--same day, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so this is the Bloody Sunday [March 7, 1965]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you got, you got hit in the--okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right, they, yeah.
Speaker 2: So she did it wrong or whatever, I don't know really.  Anyway, a keloid, okay, so I got this permanent scar.
Speaker 1: Well, (unclear) earned for a good cause, I guess, you know what I mean.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a good cause, yeah.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) say that, yeah.
Speaker 2: I had another scar, too.  It's in my hair up here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I was in high school, we used to straighten our hair, conk it, all right.  And I'm putting so much of that grease in my hair and put the do rag around here, keep (unclear) that I suspect 'cause, you know, the hair would kinda turn green or red, depends on how the hot comb and all that stuff.  I always blame me, myself, for doing that, and that's how I lost my hair.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you think that's--
Speaker 2: But that's another scar for another reason (laughter).
Story_ID: 90216
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, yeah, so, yeah, so you, you were there for that, that historic--
Speaker 1: Bloody Sunday [March 7, 1965 in Selma, Alabama].
Speaker 2: Yeah, Bloody Sunday, and then take--well, what kind of courage did you have to have to go back across again and--
Speaker 1: Well, it was really not much--I mean, it, you know, 'cause the young people were in the front.  It was not really, you know, I was never into gospel, okay, gospel music.  And as you know, in all the Civil Rights, well, marches, it was a church that was found.  Gospel singers, singers had to get together and so forth because that was the only form of music that would inspire you, you know.  I can't remember the name of the church down in Selma [Alabama], but there were a couple of songs that inspired me, okay.  In other words, to face bullets, so to speak, okay, and go to jail, and all that kind of stuff.  So I think it was the music.
Speaker 2: Well, what were the songs?
Speaker 1: I don't remember, I don't remember.  I knew while we were in the church, one was "Precious Lord, Take My Hand".  But there was another song, I don't remember, but that inspired me.  Of course, the time the cop hit me on the side of my head, then the reality went out.
Speaker 2: Right.  Now, what did you want to do when you got hit?
Speaker 1: Nothing--I wanted to fight back.  I was bleeding, screaming, in pain, and that was about it.
Speaker 2: And there aren't too many of us that have been in that situation where you're in a demonstration.  You get clubbed by the police and you, you're pledged to nonviolence, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was pledged to nonviolent.  I mean, that was one of the reasons to participate and so forth.  I mean, 'cause [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] wouldn't, you know, there was a lot of, there was a lot of workshops on that issue because that's, you know, your natural reaction is to fight back.  It's, you know, so well, and I was pledged to nonviolence.
Speaker 2: In that situation, there may not have been much good to fight back.
Speaker 1: Oh, no, we would lose anyway.
Speaker 2: There was too many--
Speaker 1: Yeah, no question about it--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --no question about it.  You'd lose anyway, yeah, you'd lose anyway, right, right, right.  But in that particular case, SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] had the bail money together and the lawyers together so it was good.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now, this is in 1964, 3 or 4?
Speaker 1: For what?
Speaker 2: The Edmund Pettus Bridge.
Speaker 1: '5 [1965].
Speaker 2: '5 [1965], '65 [1965], okay.  Now, were, were you in Mississippi in '64 [1964]?  Did you go to that?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay.  A lot of people were down there for, you know, the freedom summer.
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, right.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So--
Speaker 1: 'Cause you got to remember, I'm back and forth to school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm just not like a full time kind of thing so--
Speaker 2: And, let's see, on the march where you went all the way, when they went all the way to Montgomery [Alabama] from Selma--
Speaker 1: Uh-hum.
Speaker 2: --were, were you on that one, too?
Speaker 1: Uh-hum, the walk, uh-hum.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And it's--
Speaker 1: But, see, by the time we got there, there were hundreds of thousands, it wasn't thousands of people, because, remember, it wasn't supposed, they weren't supposed to make it.  We weren't supposed to make it.  That's what the whites said.  We were not going to make it, plus everybody had guns 'cause it was squirrel season.  So people, the whites had guns in the car and so forth.  But any case, by the time you got there, you had a lot of well-known people, whites and blacks, you know, that joined King on stage, so the rest is history.
Story_ID: 90217
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, now were you there in the South when Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Toure] first uttered the term "Black Power" in this--
Speaker 2: I was not--see, he uttered that term on a march that took up from Meredith, okay, 'cause [James] Meredith was shot.  And he was part of that took up that freedom walk [March Against Fear in June 1966], okay.  I was not in that, okay.  I was in South Carolina doing something else, but I was not in that march, no, 'cause it was on a march when he uttered that--at, at the chagrin of [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.], 'cause King was in the same march--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --but I wasn't there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: Now, you say you were attracted to the Black Panther Party?
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: It was around 19-, 1965- [sic, the Black Panther Party was founded in 1966]
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --around the time that you made the march, you, you were--were, were you a member there, were you--
Speaker 2: I became one then.
Speaker 1: After or before?
Speaker 2: After the march.
Speaker 1: Okay, after the march, all right.  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Go ahead.
Speaker 1: Yeah, where did you join?
Speaker 2: Chicago here.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Chicago [Illinois] had one of the strongest chapters.  Even though I was still in Kent, okay, and turned to Cleveland, 'cause I didn't graduate till '67 [1967] from Kent State [University in Kent, Ohio].  Anyway, I liked their militancy.  I liked the--the thing that really attracted me the most was their plan to establish a new government, okay.  I really liked that, and I also liked the fact that they were willing to unite with other people, whites and others, who had shared the same philosophy and so forth.  So, it, it's really in the news.  I was getting tired of these jails and beatings (laughter).  I wasn't tired of [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] , and I supported him fully when he made that 1967 speech [at Riverside Church in New York City, New York] in terms of against the war 'cause I just told you what I went through and so on.  So I was attracted to them.
Story_ID: 90218
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you mentioned [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.].  Did, did you get a chance to interact with Dr. King?
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What, what are your impressions of Dr. King on a personal basis?
Speaker 2: Tremendous mind.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He, I mean he was like--his speaking, he made it plain and simple, contrary to some speakers today (laughter).  He used a lot of phrases from the Bible, on and so forth.  I only met him twice, okay--a masterful person.
Speaker 1: What were the circumstances that you met him?
Speaker 2: In a march.
Speaker 1: Just in a march?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in a march, and at one church in Atlanta.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he was just a powerful speaker.  He made, he made you understand.  It made things simple.  That's, that's my greatest impression.
Speaker 1: Okay.  He'd cut issues simple (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, yeah, I--it made things simple, you know, the way you put words together.  You know, I tell my students, don't just read the last two lines of that speech of, that he gave in [Washington] D.C. at the march and so forth, the March on Washington's speech.  Read the whole speech because "Free at last, free at last," that's what they want you to believe.  Just concentrate on that while you're dead--no, read his whole speech on how he came up to that point, okay, or even the one, "I've been to the mountain top, I might not get there".  But read the whole speech, okay, because what they have done is they've kind of sanitized him, okay, in history, all right.  He was just a dreamer and something of that nature.  No, or even the book, "Letters from a Birmingham Jail." [sic, "Letter from a Birmingham Jail"]  Read that book on the answer of what he had to say to the white clergies about why you got these kids in jail, on and so forth.  So I mean he was, you know, what can you say?  I mean, that's it for me.
Story_ID: 90219
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now, let's go back to the Panthers [Black Panther Party], I guess.  So, now you came to Chicago [Illinois]--that was your chapter--
Speaker 2: When I--
Speaker 1: --the closest chapter to you to--
Speaker 2: At that time, right--
Speaker 1: Where you were?
Speaker 2: --to Cleveland [Ohio].
Speaker 1: And here in Chicago--
Speaker 2: I came to Chicago in 1967--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --okay, to go to graduate school at the University of Chicago [Illinois], okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were here--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, you, you joined the Panther Party before you--
Speaker 2: Before, right, right, right, but I still went to graduate school in 1967 [sic, the Chicago chapter of the Black Panther Party was founded in 1968].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I was in the Panthers then--did a lot of good things.  I was kind of the money person.  There were several whites, well-known whites here in the city of Chicago, that funded the Panthers.  So one of my duties was collecting the money, okay, which was interesting, but 'cause of them are still alive today and so forth, and are very wealthy.  We had educational programs.  We--and I was in charge of their education.  We were trying to get the Blackstone Rangers and the [Gangster] Disciples away from fighting each other.  So I used to have classes right over here on, on Woodlawn and 62nd Street.  There was a building across from the bank over there which was, it was in the Stones territory.  So I would have public education classes there on try to get them from gang banging, but it was sponsored by the Panthers, okay.  So that was my other duty was kind of education, 'cause I graduated from school.  So I was looking upon having a degree and all that kind of stuff, plus I'd been overseas, down South, and all this kind of stuff.  So, those were very interesting because you had the Main 21, [David] Barksdale with the Disciples, and what's his name with the, with the--
Speaker 1: Jeff Fort?
Speaker 2: Jeff Fort with the Stones.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we would have these educational classes.  One time, I had--we--I was having a class at the Panthers headquarters on the West Side.  It was very funny--well, it wasn't funny at the time.  But the police had surrounded the building 'cause we were upstairs on the second floor.  The police had surrounded the building.  And the Panthers saw the police out there, so they pulled down these grates over the windows, okay.  And I said, look, how many guns y'all got?  They had about 20 guns, 30 guns.  And how many rounds?  About five something, thousand.  I said, I'm leaving.  They said, Rogers, you ain't going no place, you staying right here with us.  I said, this is sure death.  So the police started firing into the building.  They started firing back.  This is sure enough a death scene the way I looked at it, but, fortunately, the police bombed the roof and gassed us all, so that saved my life.   That's 'cause them police wanted to kill us.  There's no question about it.  No--and, and the young brother there with these little pop guns, 500 round ammunition, I mean, what is that?  So what happened after that in terms of the Panthers--
Speaker 1: What, what was anybody arrested in (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, everybody was.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, I (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: We all were.
Speaker 1: I mean, I thought you have another story here.
Speaker 2: We all were, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--
Speaker 2: We all were.
Speaker 1: What were you, I mean, how did you escape being in prison for a long time?
Speaker 2: Well, I was in jail for a little while.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous), you know, that's--
Speaker 2: But they couldn't--my fingerprints were on, on nothing, in terms of the weapons and so forth.  So there was no felony charge.  I was just a teacher and I didn't have a felony record.
Speaker 1: So did they put any of the Panthers in, in jail
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Anybody with--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and, and some of the gang members.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean, they knew the gang members, well, obviously so.
Story_ID: 90220
Speaker 1: It's been said that they, the police were always equating the Black Panthers with, with gang activity (unclear).
Speaker 2: No.  I applied under the Freedom of Information Act and got my records.  I got them here, okay.  They, they didn't send me all of them.  They sent me some of them.  They told me what pages--the government told me what pages they kept and blah, blah, blah.  And they say it's still classified and all that kind of stuff which, to me, certified it on the role of the police and the Panthers, okay.  I mean, even, even, and after the riots, after [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] died, and we had the West Side riots here and so far in '68 [1968], the State Street Eight, which is a group of businessmen that primarily controlled State Street, the businesses.  And they, at that time, they met every Wednesday, and at least the period I was with them, they--the president was Ben Heineman who was the president of Inland Steel [sic, Ben Heineman was president of Northwest Industries, Inc. and Joseph L. Block was chairman of Inland Steel company] and, okay.  Right after, this is right after the riots, okay, on the West Side.  Heineman called the two gangs [Blackstone Rangers and Gangster Disciples] and us, the Panthers [Black Panther Party], and about thirty some other odd groups together, black groups, okay, for a meeting down-, downtown, talking about they don't want the Panthers or the gangs to be tearing up State Street, all right.  He has $5 million, okay.  Jeff Fort reaches over and says, I might be asleep and the Stones might be downtown tearing up.  Ben Heineman says, here's another million, $6 million, okay.  We left the meeting.  The question becomes, who will get this money?  You got forty some groups, all right.  The Stones and the D's, of the 6 million got 5.5 million, all right.  Of that 5.5 million, more went to the D's than the Stones.  Eighty kids that summer were killed in gang warfare between the D's and the Stones.  That went our educational program out the window, out the window.  They knew that, they knew that--for them eighty kids to be killed 'cause one got money than the other.  But that finished us in terms of the educational program, in terms of the Panthers.
Speaker 1: This was in 1968?
Speaker 2: '68 [1968], uh-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right after King got killed, uh-hum, right.
Story_ID: 90221
Speaker 1: So the Panthers [Black Panther Party] was, I mean, there was, you know the rest of the story, I mean, they were assassinated, Mark Clark and Fred Hampton, here [Chicago, Illinois] and so forth.
Speaker 2: And what was Fred Hampton and Mark Clark, can you tell us about them?
Speaker 1: They were young kids.  They were in my classes.  They were young, impressionable.  You gotta remember--we're talking about now '69 [1969], '8 [1968], '70 [1970], okay [sic, Fred Hampton and Mark Clark were killed on December 4, 1969].  I'm getting ready to have another chapter change in my life, so to speak.  But they were young and impressionable, (unclear) the Panthers for a little time.  I mean, it was set up.  This is reality--killed by the police [Fred Hampton and Mark Clark were killed on December 4, 1969].  The head of security was in the police so--
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, now, Fred Hampton, he's, he's, he was said to be a great extemporaneous speaker, you know.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, well, actually, they both were really.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, actually they both were.
Speaker 2: And I don't think there's any footage out--I've never seen it footage in Mark Clark, but Fred Hampton, have you ever seen that?
Speaker 1: I've seen some on PBS, some specials they've done on the Panthers and so forth, and, uh-hum.
Story_ID: 90222
Speaker 1: But they, they, I mean, the Pant-, in my opinion, the Panthers did a lot of good things.  In spite of all the rhetoric, carrying the guns out there in, in California, and in spite of Jonathan Jackson, you know, in the courtroom situation (unclear), all that kind of stuff, they did some very good things in the--I mean, they were well respected 'cause they had the breakfast.  They had a school program.  They got these doctors together in Chicago.  There were free doctors, and all this kind of stuff in terms of free clinics, and all this kind of stuff.  And they presented a positive militant image.  And that was attractive, as you know, I mean, even songs, T-shirts.  I mean this nonsense they got out here today is nihilism.  It's just totally ridiculous--all these rap songs, they're talking about killing, and all this, calling "bitches," and all this stuff.  So you're talking about, as you well know, you're talking about a group that was positive in spite of what the police portrayed, in spite of what the, the U.S. government said.  It was a positive, in my opinion, a positive organization.
Speaker 2: They had a strong image--
Speaker 1: They had a strong image--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --exactly.
Speaker 2: And there was, is that--I guess, for want of a better word, a hip image, too, for--
Speaker 1: Right, uh-hum.
Speaker 2: --for, you know--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --a cool image, whatever, for, you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: They received the black jackets and berets--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --dark glasses, you know, the symbol of the Black Panthers.
Speaker 1: Right, uh-hum.
Speaker 2: You know, here's a guy who's actually for the black community and--
Speaker 1: Right, it's a positive image, in my opinion.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He's got ideas beyond his own.
Speaker 1: Right.  And you, you're talking about looking at other cultures.  You're talking about socialism.  You're talking about building a new society.  I mean, it, it was just a positive image.
Story_ID: 90223
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now how, how long did you remain associated with the Black Panthers or--
Speaker 2: Till '71 [1971].
Speaker 1: And was, was there any time you, you, is there a time when you, you thought that maybe there's some problems with the Panther party?  It's--
Speaker 2: Not with the Panthers.  I was becoming kind of disillusioned--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --just with the whole struggle.  So, I was in the process of my Ph.D at U of C [University of Chicago in Illinois].  So, I got a grant and I went to East Africa for two years to do my writing, to teach at the University of Dar es Salaam [Tanzania], and at Cairo University, American University, in Cairo [Egypt].
Speaker 1: This is in 1971?
Speaker 2: '71 [1971], right.
Speaker 1: Now, there, that, that's interesting 'cause there are a lot of African Americans who went, went to Tanzania (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Tanzania, I met them all.
Speaker 1: And, and there was a great group, you know.
Speaker 2: I met them all.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Right, I was there, exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: Bob Moses (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Exactly, right.
Speaker 1: --while SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] was there even.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum, even Stokely [Carmichael, later named Kwame Toure] came.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Brought by the Tanzania Ambassador and so forth.
Speaker 1: [Amiri] Baraka had a group there.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: And, and then later, later on in the '70's [1970s], the Center for Black Educators.
Speaker 2: Well, see, the Tanzanian government made it clear after Ghana, [Kwame] Nkrumah, that Tanzania would welcome any African American who wanted to leave the United States.  And they provided them a safe haven, even tried to get them jobs, and so forth.  So you had a lot of black Americans in Tanzania.  The unfortunate thing is they messed up, most of them messed up in Tanzania.  They started selling marijuana.  I mean, marijuana is smoked in Tanzania for religious purposes, okay, ceremony.  I mean, people ain't sitting around all day long, getting high, all right.  Here come the brother, he trying to put it in a bag and sell it.  All right (laughter).  Oh, no, no, they can't get it.  Then, not, not respecting the culture of the Tanzania in terms of dress, mannerisms, we started attacking the Asians, store owners and, you know, the Indians, and so forth, Asians.  So it began a very messy kind of situation but what happened to me, okay--
Story_ID: 90567
Speaker 1: So tell me, we, we were talking about the group in Tanzania.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean, I, I left there to do work on my Ph.D [University of Chicago in Illinois], but really to collect material for my dissertation and so forth, 'cause I was kinda disillusioned with what was happening in the United States.  I mean, SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] is falling apart and so forth after [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] died.  And then the Panthers [Black Panther Party] were falling apart.  And the government was on the Panthers, the party.  And so, I thought it was like a cooling out period, so to speak.  But then, I got hooked up with the little racial movements because Dar [Dar es Salaam. Tanzania] was the center for FRELIMO [Mozambique Liberation Front] of Mozambique; the ANC [African National Congress] of South Africa; ZAPU [Zimbabwe African People's Union] of Zimbabwe; and MPLA [People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola] of Angola; and, and SWAPO [South West Africa People's Organization] in Nimibia.  So they were there, and they had training camps there.  So then I became a reporter for left-wing magazines in this country on the liberation movements, okay.  So I got to know many of the people in the liberation movements at that time, okay.  I would go into Northern Mozambique with FRELIMO in terms of their fight against the Portuguese.  So, I would write correspondence.  So I for-, kinda forgot about my dissertation.  I collected some stuff and blah, blah, blah, but, see, I had a grant, so I had to justify doing something.  I had a grant from the University of Chicago, okay.
Speaker 1: What, what was your initial research on, I mean, what--
Speaker 2: What my dissertation was going to be on?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, east capitalist relationships in East Africa before the fifteenth century--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and its relationship between East Africa and India because it was a lot of trade--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --okay, between the two.
Speaker 1: Oh, it was down trade (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Right, right.  But I kinda lost interest, but I had to do something in terms of kinda justifying this grant and so forth.  But nevertheless, I got involved with the liberation movements.  Now, once I left Tanzania, then I went to Egypt because I had to do some Arabic stuff in Egypt.  And I was able to get a part-time teaching position at the American University in Cairo.  Anyway, when I got back, I was given a charge by the ANC to try to financially establish a presence in the United States because the ANC was banned by the U.S. government as being a terrorist organization, okay.  So I went to the UN [United Nations], and they sent over from Tanzania to South Africa in the ANC.  And the UN granted them observer status, okay, the ANC.  But they could only--they could not leave twenty-five miles outside of New York [New York City, New York].  They had to stay within twenty-five miles in New York 'cause they were banned and so forth.  I mean, the U.S. government was supporting apartheid and all this kind of stuff.  So this, this kind of activity in helping them financially and other kind of ways, kinda got me in close with the ANC.  Well, it did.  This is reality and so forth, so that led to a lot of things around the world including international conferences and so forth.  It led to me being the co-sponsor of the Free Nelson Mandela Committee when he was released in February 2nd, 19-, 1990 from jail.  I became the treasurer of the organization of his eleven city tour when he was that first tour when he came and so forth.  We raised close to $50 million for the ANC.  And then, I had him here in Chicago--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --in '93 [1993].
Story_ID: 90568
Speaker 1: Now, I want to backtrack a little bit to go back to--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --to this initial involvement with ANC [African National Congress].  Yeah, this is, you know, a significant thing.  Now you, you were for years, I guess, you had the--you, you were like a spokesperson--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --for the ANC in North America.  I mean, that, that's a tremendous responsibility and--
Speaker 2: Well, you know what?  We, me and my wife, just came back from London [England], and we stayed with the South African Ambassador to London [High Commissioner Lindiwe Mabusa].  After Nelson [Mandela] was released, she was the representative for the ANC here in Washington [D.C.] and so forth, okay.  She was a student of mine.  She was a teacher herself at Ohio University [Athens, Ohio] when I used to teach at Ohio U, okay.  And she always tells the story, and I get so embarrassed by it, because she is the South African Ambassador.  And she tells people, she, she told, she gave us a dinner with five ambassadors two weeks ago, African ambassadors, and she always tells--she tells the story how I got her into the ANC.  When I met her, she was not in the ANC.  I couldn't believe it.  I said, how can you be South African, black, and not in the ANC?  I, I really couldn't believe it.  So I asked her to collect clothes, just collect some clothes for the people in the refugee camps, and so forth and so on.  She always tells the story how it was me who got her where she's at, okay.  Now, I really don't like this because it makes me feel, I don't know, I just don't really like it, okay.  So, yes, I've been involved with them a long time, okay.  And they have offered me jobs, the new government has, so it's a long time relationship.  I've just not done it, you know.  They've been very instrumental.  They have said this many times--and it's in writing that any black American is welcomed for a job in South Africa.  And under the sanctions bill, when it was finally lifted, when the sanctions bill went into effect, it said that once sanctions are lifted in South Africa, that USAID [U.S. Agency for International Development] with the U.S. government, through USAID would fund any minority, black Americans, for projects in South Africa.  And a lot of black Americans have done that.  They got money from the U.S. government to do different projects.  The biggest known project is the Whitney Houston one.  Whitney Houston, Bobby Brown, [Cochran] Cochran, Spike Lee, one or two others or some, formed a little company about three or four years ago, to bottle--they went to Pepsi, 'cause Pepsi pulled out.  Coke [Coca-Cola] stayed, okay.  Pepsi pulled out, and they went to Pepsi to get the exclusive rights to sell Pepsi in southern Africa.  It's called, it was called the New Age Bottling Company [sic, New Age Beverages].  They got the money from this bill, the South Africa government to do so.  Whitney went over and did a HBO special.  It was about two years ago or something [sic, 1994].  They sold the company for big money, but what I'm saying is, is that that's been the most successful one I know, okay.  But a lot of black Americans--I've not really taken advantage of none of this stuff, all right, because I don't look at myself as taking advantage of.  It's--I'm just playing a part in the struggle, but not to take advantage of it, so, yes, my relationship is long and deep with the ANC, no question about that.
Story_ID: 90569
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, when you left Tanzania, you left Tanzania in what, what year, what year was it?
Speaker 2: I left Tanzania in '72 [1972]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to Egypt.  And then in '73 [1973], I came back to the United States.
Speaker 1: What did you think of Egypt?
Speaker 2: Oh, I loved it.  I really, I love the people, very, very nice, very relaxed, very friendly.  I don't know, I love Egypt, I really love Egypt.  Egypt probably is my most second favorite country is Egypt.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you, did you get a chance to look at the monuments and--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, sure, oh, yeah, all that stuff, no problem.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You're not impressed with any of it?
Speaker 2: (Laughter), oh, well, what can you say?  There's so many--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --in terms of monuments, oh, yeah, but I love Egypt.  We were back there a couple of years ago and so forth, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you have any observations about, about race in Egypt?
Speaker 2: You know, Egypt, the last ruler of Egypt was Cleopatra, the 1,002.  There are 1,001 Cleopatras.  The last one was not even Egyptian.  She was from Eastern Europe, okay.  That was the last real ruler of Egypt in 320 A.D.  The next one is Gamal Abdel Nasser [Hussein] in 1952 A.D [Egyptian revolution of 1952].  In that period of time, you got everybody else ruling Egypt, the British, the French, the Turks, everybody.  So the northern part of Egypt, I mean, I'm talking about Cairo to Alexander [sic, Alexandria] and so forth--the city on the, on the coast.  In terms of skin color, it's light because you got all these other groups who ruled Egypt.  The dark Egyptians are in the south, okay, because the French, the British, whatever, never really penetrated into the south.  They only concerned themselves with the northern part of Egypt and so forth.  So when you, when you get into a question of race, it's kinda hard for them to understand what you're talking about.  I mean, they don't look at it in the same way we do, okay.  So it's no really, I mean, 'cause their history is different.  And they just have a different history and so forth.  But they are very, very friendly, very, very friendly, very, very nice people with the Egyptians.  And they don't, they do not consider themselves Arabs.  They will tell you they are Egyptian which is different than those in Saudi Arabia.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So how long were you in Egypt?
Speaker 2: A year.
Speaker 1: A year?
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's good enough.  Did you meet the DuBoises in Egypt (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: I had a connection beforehand--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because of the political party I was in.
Speaker 1: 'Cause what, what I'm talking about is David DuBois, I think (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah, and the political (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous).
Speaker 2: I had a political--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --I had a political connection 'cause of the political party I was in, right.
Speaker 1: The people listed in this don't know anything about it.  That's why I'm trying to explain this on tape, you know.
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, oh, well, you know, David--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous), me.
Speaker 2: Well, another party I was in was the Communist Party--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --of the U.S., okay.  David was in the Communist Party, but he was in the Communist Party of China, okay, him and his mother, Shirley Graham DuBois, and so forth.  So I knew, I mean, I had a connection, okay.  When [HM] Angela [Davis] got out of jail [1972], oh, that Soledad [Brothers] stuff and so forth, Jonathan Jackson and stuff--
Speaker 1: Davis, right? (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: I organized her trip to Africa, so some of those pictures you took were some or all that, okay, to thank people in Africa for the support they gave her and to Free Angela Davis Committees, and so on, okay.  So, in other words, I had the connections.  I mean, this is the reality and so forth.  And, yeah, I stayed a year in Cairo, then I came back here.
Story_ID: 90570
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you came here, did you, were, were you back, back in Ohio again?
Speaker 2: Well, I was at first, I wasn't always living here, but I was commuting to Antioch [College in Yellow Springs, Ohio] in terms of teaching.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, that's Yellow Springs, Ohio?
Speaker 2: Yellow Springs, Ohio, exactly.
Speaker 1: The most liberal university in the United States, college in the United States.
Speaker 2: Right, that's what they say, right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So what were you teaching in Antioch?
Speaker 2: African history.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  I was head of the--what do you call it--ISP, the Institute for Social Policy or something like ISSP [Institute for the Solution of Social Problems].  I forgot what it stands for and so forth.  And then, I finally got a teaching position here [Chicago, Illinois] at the City Colleges [of Chicago].
Speaker 1: Now you said you were at Ohio University [Athens, Ohio].
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: Was, was that during this period or after--
Speaker 2: No, it was late 60's [1960s].
Speaker 1: Okay.  You were there before you went to Africa?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Ohio University, okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Oh, they have a real strong left leaning at Ohio University, too.
Speaker 2: The black studies program was, right.
Speaker 1: Right, right, okay.  So any, anything significant happen at Antioch or--
Speaker 2: No, not really.  There were a lot of smart students down there, black students and white students, too.  But, no, you know, it was, it was kind of a hippy kind of an environment, kind of situation, and so forth.  And I would drive every week from here to Antioch to Yellow Springs, okay.  I had a little red Volkswagen at that time.  I would drive down on Monday morning and come back on a Wednesday night.  I had to arranged everything for Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday.
Speaker 1: That's a tough life, I guess, that's six hours, seven hours (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, but I wasn't going to stay there--ain't nothing to do down there, right, there's nothing to do down there in Yellow Springs.
Story_ID: 90571
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, so you got a position here in Chicago [Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --now where did you, okay.
Speaker 2: Well, at first, it was at Kennedy-King, City Colleges [of Chicago] and then I transferred over to Olive-Harvey [College]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to become chairman of the Department of African American Studies at Olive-Harvey.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what year is this?
Speaker 2: About 1980, I believe, when I transferred over.  We're the only Department of African American Studies in a two-year school in the country, okay.  And the department was founded in 1975.  And we have an Annual Black Studies Conference which will be in a couple of weeks.  This will be our 27th year in terms of black studies conference.  So we're the only one in the country that I know of in a two-year school--of course, all the four-year schools and support.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that, that's significant, you mean, that you have both of those, I mean, that and the fact that, that it's the only one and the Black Studies Conference is a--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum, you're familiar with it, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, but the people that listen to this is (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I am trying--
Speaker 2: Okay, right, right.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).  Yeah, it's, see, it's, it's a nationally --
Speaker 2: A national--
Speaker 1: --internationally recognized.
Speaker 2: Right, right, and people from all the country come.
Speaker 1: Yeah, political science professors, black studies professors from all the major universities come to little Olive-Harvey College.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And they get into some serious discussions.
Speaker 2: Right, right, exactly.
Speaker 1: Who came up with the idea for that?  Did you--
Speaker 2: Well, at that time, it was a group of black teachers at Olive-Harvey who founded--the department came up with the idea of a conference.  I think the conference started maybe one or two years after the department was founded and so forth.  And so, we have a coordinator, Armstead Allen, who's in my department, and he kinda organizes and runs it and so forth, so it's been going on.  It's, as I said, it'll be another two or three weeks, here in April, and so forth.  And we have had nationally-known black scholars from around, you know, to address the, the conference, yes.
Speaker 1: That's right, I mean, yeah, some of the best scholars in the country--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: show up, you know.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: It is.  And do you pay them a lot of money to show up?
Speaker 2: No.  We raise the money ourselves.  Mainly, we pay for a hotel and air, air travel.  Most of them do it for free, to tell you the truth.  We, we have, like the Gospel Fest.  We have luncheons, and this is all student run now, okay.  Sometimes the Chancery gives us some money of the City Colleges, and so forth.  But it's basically student run, okay, because we feel that, I mean, we get our students involved in our African American Studies Department a lot of things.  I mean, we just took a bus load down a couple of weeks ago to protest this war [Iraq War], and so forth.
Story_ID: 90572
Speaker 1: So we get our--we look--I see the department chair [the Department of African American Studies at Olive-Harvey College in Chicago, Illinois] as chair as academics and activism, so that what you teach in the classroom, you have to get them involved on a day to day, you know, on things in the community because many of our people, as you know, just totally unaware with anything going on.  And, you know, it's not like the '60's [1960s] where you had people involved in things.  You know, people today would rather have a jersey with somebody's number on it than as opposed to a jersey that says something--it spells out something, and so forth.  So we're talking about a different kind of crowd, different kind of student, black student, and so forth that are, you know, in school today and so forth.  It's not the kind of activism, so we see our department as being kind of an activist kind of thing in terms of getting students involved.
Speaker 2: Okay.  You know what?  Act-, activism is more widespread during the '60's [1960s] and '70's [1970s]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --late 60's [1960s] or early '70's [1970s], but, but do you think that's many more really?  I mean, you know, there are that many more (unclear) people in those days?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.  I think today with the young people, young students, and so forth, the role models are role models that are not positive.  For an example, today, take the demonstration that was in New York [New York City, New York] around that West African guy who was shot 44 [sic, 41] times [February 4, 1999]--I can't think of his name, and so forth now--Amadou Diallo, I think his name was, and so forth.
Speaker 2: Right, that, that's it.
Speaker 1: Right.  I remember, I didn't go to that, but I remember Jesse talking, or [HM Reverend] Jesse Jackson, talking about there were no young people in the march.  And he asked this rapper, Puffy, to try to get some rappers, okay, to participate in the march.  He couldn't get any because most of them had felony records.  And if you have a felony record, they can hold you--the police--when you go to do a minor demonstration, okay.
Speaker 2: Can't risk being a--
Speaker 1: Right, can't risk being--now, my generation, the younger generation, I've never had a felony record.  I've been arrested a lot of times, but not a felony.  There's a difference, okay--misdemeanor, trespassing, or some old stuff I did.  That means that a lot of the young people can't even participate, particularly rappers in a march in which there is going to be some civil disobedience.
Speaker 2: Do you know what the statistics are now?  They're some dramatic statistics now about the, the number of, like so many at five young black men now are in the criminal justice system.  What is it?
Speaker 1: Well, but, you know, the basic, the basic here between a 19 and 29, a third of all young blacks are involved in the criminal justice system in some kind of way.  They're either on parole, in jail, got an ankle bracelet on, something, okay.
Speaker 2: That's one-third, that's something.
Speaker 1: A third, that's a lot.  And in some states, you lose your voting rights.  In some states, you lose, if you got a felony record in some states, you lose your voting rights, which has become serious.  So you're talking about a whole different crowd of folk in terms of young people today and, and my generation and your generation, in terms of participation in something.  So the, the imagery--it's not there.  The music don't help, in my opinion.  So that's another issue.  And then, there are so many materialistic kinds of things.  People, I think, are more materialistic today, are more concerned about getting some money or something materialistic than as opposed to what's in their head, and so forth.  It's just a different generation, it's just a different--now whether I didn't do my job right or, or whatever, it's a different generation in terms of what you're dealing with in terms of people.  I mean, I was--had a lecture the other day and, and talking about that most people, black people, when they came North, particularly women, were domestic workers.  And, one student asked me, what is a domestic worker?  So I'd had to kinda like check myself that what I might assume that somebody would know.  Now, she was about 20, 21, or something of that nature, and so forth.  I was shocked that maybe I shouldn't be shocked in terms of what people know, okay.  So it's, it's an entirely, it's just an entirely different thing.  It's just an entirely different ball game out here.
Story_ID: 90573
Speaker 1: Now, when you teach students in this generation, I mean, what have you found, or what have you found to be effective, you know, to get students to raise the kind of money it takes for this Black Students Conference and do other things?
Speaker 2: Once you let them know the history and the importance, they respond.  But look, you have--take the City Colleges of Chicago [Illinois], for an example.  There are 100 and--they say there are 165,000 students in various programs and so forth, scattered into seven different campuses, okay.  Of the blacks that are in the City Colleges, 68 percent are black female, okay.  So right away, that changes the whole pass because that means that black female was already happening--are being the ones who are getting the jobs and making the money.  That's the reality out here.  Last year, in every professional field, whether it was lawyer, engineer, doctor, black females suppress--surpass black men, the money, in every professional field out here.  So you're talking about a student body that's different, okay, that is female driven in terms of (unclear).  Secondly, the skills are poor.  I'm talking about--basic reading and writing skills are poor, okay, so that means a lot of remedial stuff.  It's not that they're stupid.  They just don't know, all right.  But once they do know, and you explain to them, then they will participate.  I mean, you know, we have people coming from Paul Robeson High School.  They don't even know who Paul Robeson was.  They (unclear) graduated from Paul Robeson High School.
Speaker 1: It seems strange that, that we have a situation like that.
Speaker 2: You would think so, yeah.  So, it's a different, it, number one, it's a different kind of teaching thing, in terms of how you relate, and so forth.  Most of my, most of the students I know, they all want to get ahead.  I mean, there are very few bad apples, if you want to say that.  They want to get ahead.  They got a lot of problems.  Most of the women got babies.  They want to get ahead and want to get a good education.  That's the best--that's why I'm teaching because most of them want to get ahead.  So, and they're not stupid.  You usually got to teach them in a different kind of way.  That's all, and so forth.  But, and, and many, many of them do very well.  I mean, in terms of going to a four-year school and, you know, this kind of thing, and so forth.  I mean, they got money problems but everybody got money problems, and so forth.  But, no, I enjoy teaching.  I can easily retire but I enjoy teaching.
Story_ID: 90574
Speaker 1: You know, now teaching affords you a lot of time and do some other things, too.
Speaker 2: Oh, definitely.
Speaker 1: So, that, that's part of the--
Speaker 2: That's the other thing, you know, right.
Speaker 1: --excitement about this because I know you've been involved in so many projects--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and activities, you know, where you can, you know, you can try to make some, some change take, take place.  So tell us about some of the things that you--other than ANC [African National Congress].
Speaker 2: I'm very much involved with the trade unions.  In 1972, I was one of the founders of a Coalition of Black Trade Unions which is a nationwide organization of blacks who hold leadership position in the unions, and so forth.  We've been in existence since--we broke away--well, we took an opposite position to the AFL-CIO because then, that was the race between [George] McGovern and [President Richard] Nixon in 1972.  And the AFL-CIO [American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations], George Meany took the position of being neutral.  We, as blacks, that held leadership, took the position that you cannot be neutral in a presidential election, and so forth.  So, we formed another organization, but the CBTU is like a continuation of other blacks since Frederick Douglass, who had formed black organizations in the unions, to address issues that blacks are concerned about.  Our concern then was that we had to support McGovern, that we have to be against apartheid, and that we have to put more leaders in the, more blacks in leadership positions of the unions because some of those unions are racist, and so forth.  So, I serve on the national executive board of the CBTU.  And I also serve as head of the international affairs department of the CBTU.  This has afforded me places to go.  I've been to Brazil twice representing them in regards to question of race in Brazil, along with the unions down in Brazil.  I was also co-chair of the delegation that went to the elections in South Africa of unions for the voting in April, and so forth.  In fact, I went to another thing in representing the CBTU in terms of anti-apartheid conference in South Africa, and so forth.  So, this kind of traveling--in fact, I was supposed to go to go to Zimbabwe last month, but I couldn't go, and so forth, in terms of their elections.  So I'm very much involved with that in terms of the CBTU.  We're getting ready to have our convention in San Francisco [California] in May.
Story_ID: 90575
Speaker 1: And so, I'm also very involved with black teachers in the City Colleges [of Chicago, Illinoi].  And I'm president of Black Faculty in Higher Education which represents black faculty and staff in the City Colleges of Chicago.  I've been in that position since around 1980 or something like that, and so forth.  We're concerned with promotion of blacks in the City Colleges and black issues, and so forth, that affect the City Colleges.  I also have an organization called the African American Studies Program that's been in existence for about twenty years that sends people to Africa and Cuba.  This is an organization of primarily educators.  It's open to anybody.  We have trips every year.  Lately, we've been going to Cuba a lot in terms of trying to break the blockade against Cuba and so on.  So that organization has been going on for some time and so forth, in terms of educating blacks about Africa and so on, and Cuba, particularly Cuba.  We sponsor things.  One of my organizations, we do a lot of sponsoring.  We get a thing here a couple of months ago with the minister of mines and lands in Zimbabwe.  It was a friend of mine, and so forth.  It was a fundraiser.  We do fundraisers for political candidates, so I'm involved with a lot.  Since I'm head of the local chapter of, of political action for the CBTU [Coalition of Black Trade Unionists], and so forth-- So, those are the main organizations that I'm involved with.
Story_ID: 117611
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, are those all the groups that you work at basically?
Speaker 2: Basically, yeah.  I mean, I do something with PUSH [Rainbow/PUSH Coalition] every now and then, different political groups in terms of election of candidates.  I was very much involved with [Chicago Mayor] Harold Washington 'cause I was in charge of about 1,000 precincts on the South and West Side.  And we operated out of the Hayes Center [Charles A. Hayes Family Investment Center].  I'm on the board of the Charles Hayes Center.  It comes to remind me about that, which is down there on 49th and Wabash, and so forth.  I was very much into--instrumental in, in terms of getting that building renovated, and we sold it to CHA [Chicago Housing Authority] for a dollar and so forth.  I was [HM] Congressman Charles Hayes' AA [administrative assistant] for Chicago [Illinois] for ten years, nine years, in terms of being in Congress.  But I was still teaching also in the City Colleges even though I was his AA and so on.  So, you know, there's a lot of stuff that I faxed over.  I, you know, I forget myself.
Speaker 1: Didn't you serve in the Washington administrative in some official ca-, capacity?
Speaker 2: No, no, I was never--served really in the Washington administration.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was invited.
Speaker 1: So you were an AA to the Con-, Congressman Hayes basically?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Hayes, yeah, yeah.  I served in the--what's his name, the other governor's administration.  What's the--
Speaker 1: [Governor George] Ryan or--
Speaker 2: No, no, it was a Democratic Governor.  I can't think of his name now, '72 [1972], '73 [1973].  He--Democrat.
Speaker 1: [Governor Dan] Walker?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Dan Walker.
Speaker 1: Dan Walker?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Dan Walker, yeah, as a labor liaison to labor.  I don't know, I have to look at the stuff myself 'cause I don't remember, I don't remember everything myself.
Story_ID: 117612
Speaker 1: Now this is something that I want to touch upon.  You can tell, tell me if this is true or not.  I've been told by labor activists that, basically, it was the labor unions in South Africa that made the difference in terms of smashing apartheid.
Speaker 2: Oh, no.
Speaker 1: Not, not that there weren't other forces--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --you know, but the unions really.
Speaker 2: No, you had--well, there were several things.  By January, well, no, by January 1990, it was clear that the apartheid government could no longer govern.
Speaker 1: It, why, why?
Speaker 2: Several things.  One was the worldwide international protests, both in sports, both in terms of divestment, both in terms of--politically, in terms of diplomatic relations, okay.  By 1990, 1989, most countries in the world had broken diplomatic relations with South Africa.  That include the United States in 1985, or the objections--I think it was [President Ronald] Reagan, and its Congress overwrote him and so forth.  There was a total sports boycott worldwide.  There was a total divestment boycott worldwide.  I mean, State of Illinois, for an example, in terms of even my teachers' fund, divested some $7 billion out of the companies that had invested in South Africa.  The City of Chicago [Illinois], for example, like all the other cities that divested from companies in South Africa, the city of Chicago had refused to accept Motorola for its police equipment in the police cars and so forth.  And they had even kicked out Coca-Cola from all city facilities, but this was being done in all cities and so forth.  Northern Trust Bank refused, but Continental Bank divested.  First National Bank divested.  I mean, there were--so the divestment campaigned economically, so that's one thing, internationally, and so for.  Then, in South Africa, you have the three groups.  You have COSATU [Congress of South African Trade Unions] which represents the unions.  You have the ANC [African National Congress], and you have the South African Communist Party, so those three groups worked together under the leadership of ANC.  For strikes and boycott and so forth, I mean, even in late 1989, the three groups called a strike in South Africa for two days--95 percent effective.  Nobody worked.  So, with these combination of forces and so forth, they had to release Nelson Mandela.  And there's just nothing else they could do.  And they had to enter into a negotiation period to plan for the elections.  I mean, it was--they couldn't govern.  I mean, out here, you are white, got all these privileges for 250, 200, 250 years under apartheid, and all of a sudden have the accumulation of events, you can no longer govern.  You're not just going to give up and so forth.  You got special privileges, so the next four years in South Africa was a period of tremendous tension and fighting.  The South Africa government financing Inkatha [Inkatha Freedom Party], that's the Zulu group; [Mangosuthu] Buthelezi to fight the ANC, and so, financed by the South African government.  The head of the Communist Party, Chris Hani, he--I organized his tour of the United States.  In fact, I got a picture of him on the wall there.  We had a fundraiser at my house for him.  And he was assassinated [April 10, 1993] by the white government and so forth.  So they did everything to prevent this election to be held in April of 1994 and so.  So the COSATU was just one aspect of it, okay, in terms of the overthrow of apartheid.  But it was all these outside forces and inside forces, but they all took their lead from the ANC.  So now, what you have is this Tri-partite Alliance.  It's still there.  The ANC runs the country.  Economically, though, the whites still have--it's in white hands, economically, but that's changing, but it's still in white hands economically and so forth.  But it's still the three, I mean, I mean, the ANC leads it.  I mean, this, this is the reality, and the ANC leads it.  And the other two organizations take their lead, but you gotta kind of keep with, keep in mind that somebody who is in the ANC is probably in COSATU in the South African Communist Party, or vice versa.  I mean, they change hats, okay, so it's not like three clear, distinct organizations.  They all--all the leadership is interchangeable.
Story_ID: 117613
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, tell us about, I guess, some detail about the, the, Nelson Mandela's visit here and how, how was that, that arranged, and who all you told (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Well, after he was--
Speaker 1: I touched on it before.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  After he was released [February 2, 1990], there was a Nelson Mandela Freedom Committee established in Washington [D.C.], okay.  The purpose of that was to plan for Mandela's arriving to the United States, and to plan for fundraisers.  The fundraisers were for the ANC [African National Congress] and so forth.  Now, there were a lot of people and a lot of organizations involved.  I mean, [HM Harry] Belafonte and Danny Glover--some of these kind of people took the leads, Spike Lee, and so forth, took the lead.  Well, Spike and Danny Glover really kinda took the lead for those in the media, entertainers, and so forth.  And others took the lead for different segments and so forth.  I was more involved with the labor segment, but I was also co-chair of the fundraising committee that we established in Washington.  In fact, we established two committees in, in D.C.  One was for profit, and one was for non-profit because it depended on the organization who has the money for him on how they could contribute and so forth, okay.  So two committees were established.  Eleven cities were selected.  This is his first trip in '90 [1990].  And, you know, it's eleven cities.  Fundraisers was in, for instance, the Kennedy family in Boston [Massachusetts] did one and so forth at the Kennedy Center.  They met with the President [George H. W. Bush] --spoke to Congress.  The only place he got negative publicity was Miami.  In Miami, the Cuban community came out against him because of his support of Fidel [Castro] in terms of the historical struggle and so forth.  I mean, as he said on the Ted Koppel Show, Ted Koppel asked him, why he supported something, basically why he supported Fidel, or something like that.  And he said, he said, in our struggle, we first came to the United States and asked for help.  And the United States did nothing.  We went to Cuba, we went to Libya, and they supported us.  And then he said, in so many words, why should now I speak out against them, my old friends, when I got a new friend like you?  I would not be a liberation fighter if I dissed them, okay.
Speaker 1: I remember that.
Speaker 2: You remember that, right, right.  And Ted Koppel was speechless.  He didn't know what to say.
Story_ID: 117614
Speaker 1: He [Nelson Mandela] is, he is an extraordinary person.  There's no question about that, and I really got to know something about him when I organized his second fundraiser here in Chicago [Illinois in 1993].  He is just a--
Speaker 2: Extraordinary.
Speaker 1: --extraordinary.  He's just a special person.  He's very unassuming.  He's very, you know, he's very, I don't know what--it's, it's to be in his presence.  I mean, he, number one, he walks every morning, so every 5, 6:00 in the morning, you gotta walk with him, okay.  He walks about a mile, all right.  Every place he goes, he does this.  He walks, okay.  He doesn't eat certain foods, okay.  He doesn't smoke, doesn't drink.
Speaker 2: Now, what does he eat?  What, what would I eat--
Speaker 1: Mainly fish.
Speaker 2: He eats fish.
Speaker 1: Fish and poultry, okay, no red meat.  Part of this is because of condition he contracted in prison and so forth.  He has bad feet, okay, so he wears special shoes, and so forth, all right.  He goes to bed on a regular schedule at night.  He's, by 9:00, he's in bed--4:30, 4, 5, he up, okay.  It's a regular routine that he got from his prison days and so forth.  He, he is not aggressive, doesn't impose his views on you.  I remember--I don't know if I should mention his name, but a well-known personality in Chicago [Illinois]--there was three of us together, Mandela, him, and me.  And this well-known personality was going on and on and on about his views in this--you should do this, you--Mandela didn't say one word.  He just thanked him, that kind of thing.  And it makes you feel--I mean, it, it makes you feel small in a sense.  When I was going over the schedule with his people, we had said, plan six events, okay, for his two days here, fundraising events and so forth.  One would be a religious one, and I would try to get the--I had [HM] Reverend [Addie L.] Wyatt work on that one from Vernon Park Church and so forth, 'cause she knows all the religious people and so forth.  So it was a balance and act between [HM Minister Louis] Farrakhan and [HM Reverend] Jesse [Jackson] on the stage, and all this ole kind of stuff.  Then we had one with the business community, so I asked Sara Lee to organize that.  And Sara Lee sponsored a breakfast for Mandela.  I think it was 80,000 a piece in terms of money.  Everybody paid $80,000.  And they had gotten about forty people together to have breakfast.  Well, it was really about access--wasn't about no breakfast and nothing like that.  Then we had a labor one over at Plumber's Hall.  Then we had a mass thing at, at, at [Operation] PUSH and so forth.
Speaker 2: That's a (unclear).
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's a (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, yeah, right.  Then we had one with black business folk, okay, black lawyers, black business type down at the hotel and so forth.  And there were six of them, six of these events, three a day, and so forth, and plus a new conference and all that, which went, financially went well in terms of, you know, raising money, and so forth.  But he is just a, he is just a special person.  He's just a special person, you know, very sincere, very humble, you know, given somebody been in jail twenty-seven years.  As someone said like, you're lucky, just got out yesterday, and just burst it off, and said, where do we begin kind of thing?  I don't know if you ever saw that film that Danny Schechter made, "Mandela Coming to America" [sic, Mandela in America]. It's excellent, it's excellent, okay, in terms of Mandela's stops in the different cities, and you know, all that kind of stuff, and so forth.  It's a very good educational piece.
Story_ID: 117615
Speaker 1: Did you know how he felt about all the support and--
Speaker 2: He felt overwhelmed, he felt overwhelmed.  He didn't think that people, he didn't think that people would respond this way.  He felt overwhelmed.  He wanted more or less to relate to young people and so forth.  There was no question about his resolve.  He knew the struggle was going to end, and they were going to be victorious.  There was no question about that in his mind and so forth.  I remember the meeting he had with [President George W.] Bush.  And Bush was coming out about terrorism this, and terrorism, talking about the ANC, on the White House lawn.  And so, terror this, and because that was the time, you know, Dick Cheney voted against Mandela, calling him a terrorist, and all that ole kind of stuff and so.
Speaker 1: And he was the only one to--
Speaker 2: Only one, yeah, yeah.  But Mandela, at that meeting on the White House lawn, Mandela had this--Bush was going on through all this terrorism stuff.  And Mandela says, I don't think the President has been pop-, properly briefed.  We will give him a proper briefing (laughter).  Okay, that's, you know, it was simply perfect, it was perfect, okay.  So he's an exceptional person.  I mean, he's still today--he's eighty-four.  He still today maintains the same schedule.  He maintains, he's kinda like an elder statesman in the world and, you know, this kind of stuff.   And, of course, he got married, and so, to Graca [Machel], but he's still main person.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, it, do you, do you have any thoughts about the, the, I guess, he has a--the split between he and Winnie Mandela and the, and--
Speaker 2: I don't want to comment on that.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, I respect that.
Story_ID: 117616
Speaker 1: And do you have any thoughts about the current South African President (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: [Thabo] Mbecki?
Speaker 1: Mbecki, Thabo (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah, Thabo, he's more business-like, okay.  I mean his background is different, of course.  Of course, [Nelson] Mandela was in jail with his father and so forth, Govan [Mbeki].  But he's more business-like.  He is more, he is more of a micromanager kinda thing, okay.  He's organized.  He has the full support of Mandela and the ANC [African National Congress] and so forth.  Johnson, Johnnie Johnson [HM John H. Johnson] gave him a big--how would you call it--a big thing at Ebony a couple of years ago and so forth.  But he's quiet.  He doesn't have the stature of a Mandela, of course, obviously.  He's quiet, he's approachable in terms of, you know, getting hold of him and so forth.  That's about what I can say.
Story_ID: 117617
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay, now, is there anything else about your, your teaching career you want to tell, tell us about City Colleges [of Chicago, Illinois]?  Now, City Colleges has pretty much left you alone to do what you want to do.
Speaker 2: Basically, uh-hum, basically.  As I said, I like, you know, I like what I'm doing in terms of teaching [at Olive-Harvey College in Chicago, Illinois].  I mean, it's, I mean, I've had good relationships with each chancellor, including the first one, (unclear).  And as an organization, black faculty and staff, we meet with each chancellor and the board members, too, and so forth.  We have been instrumental in--with the Mayor, in recommending what board members should be in the City College on board and so forth.  And some of those suggestions have been taken and so on.  But, yeah, I mean, we, in other words, we have not experienced any hostility or negativity from administration as of yet, okay, on anything, with basically, and so on.  So, I just hope that we can hire more people.  That's what I want to do is hire more folks because the City Colleges is not hiring people.  They're hiring these adjuncts and so forth, but our program is going well--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --'cause we got the students.  I mean, all our classes are full.
Story_ID: 117618
Speaker 1: Now, well, okay, back to South Africa for a second.  I mean, if you would, what are your projections about?   Do you think, think things are going well now?  (Simultaneous).
Speaker 2: As well as can be expected at this point, I mean, they've been only in existence for almost ten years now.  So, you know, people expect change quickly, particularly, they had no running water and electricity and all that kind of stuff.  They'll move very fast on that, but everybody's not--everybody, they don't, they have not fulfilled getting everybody electricity or running clean water, okay.  Nor have they fulfilled new housing totally.  They have, to some extent, maybe half-way, but not everybody, okay, on terms of the population and so forth.  But there's still resistance by the white business community.  I always tell people if you go to Africa, don't go to South Africa first.  If you've never been no place in Africa, don't go to South Africa first because you would never think you were in Africa.  It's so modern, okay.  It's best to go to some other country in Africa, then go to South Africa.  If you go there first, oh, no.  I mean, you could--Africa, South Africa is the only country where you can take your ATM card; go to the gas station with a machine; put your ATM in there; punch in your number; and get your money.  So, you know, what that leads to?  You can retire here, right?  Have your money sent to your bank here (laughter), and withdraw it out of a ATM there.
Speaker 1: That's the only country--
Speaker 2: The only country in Africa you can do that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  So, I, I think it will develop much more.  I think once they get in more leadership 'cause it's only ten years, I mean, heck, most of these people, they don't know nothing about--  The biggest problem was how do you run the government?  You can run, you win a liberation movement, but how do you run a government?  That's a different story.  So, I think they're doing all right, uh-hum.
Story_ID: 117619
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I, I'm going to throw some, some names at you or some names of coun-, countries, and people, and just get a quick reaction.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: Now, you went to Mali.  Now what, can, can you give us a brief (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Well, it's a very poor country.  Mali is very poor.  They have a new government there.  It's elected.  I mean, it's one of the poorest countries in the world.  Culturally, it's very wealthy.  I mean, the culture is unbelievable in terms of this culture and the history and so forth, and the art, and so forth.  The unfortunate thing about Mali is that you have a lot of Europeans stealing their art, so ends up in private collectors in Europe.  People fly in, steal the stuff, and fly out, and so forth.
Speaker 1: What kind of art are we talking about?
Speaker 2: Well, mainly Dogon, which is the major culture, the Fulani, or Puel as the French call them, mainly their art.  And they have all the gold items and so forth.  So, you'll find these things in Europe in private collectors or museums, uh-hum.  But it's a very poor country.  I mean, even the main city, Bamako, doesn't even have paved roads.
Speaker 1: And you visited Timbuktu, I think.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum, that's way up there in the northern part, uh-hum.  That's where you'd better go in the right time of the year 'cause it's very hot and very dusty.  It's not developed.  Even the libraries, I think, even, I would say, it had Harvard [University in Cambridge, Massachusetts], mentioned something from--
Speaker 1: [HM Henry Louis "Skip"] Gates [Jr.] and (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Gates, yeah.  The library is not kept up.  They have a lot of old books in there that needed to be modernized and so forth, but it's, it's rich historically.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That, that's a site of the old, the--
Speaker 2: University.
Speaker 1: --the, it's the African empires and--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum, right.
Speaker 1: --Songhai, you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Goa, Mali, Songhai.
Speaker 2: Djenne (ph.), uh-hum, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  What about Brazil?
Speaker 2: Brazil is interesting.  It's interesting in the sense on the question of race, okay.  We got about 160-70 million people in Brazil, and at least over, over 60 percent of African descent, but they got all these categories of color, all right.  I don't know--the last time I counted, it was 200 different categories of color.  And they just started--it was in the paper the other day, of the affirmative action program in Brazil.  The new government, the labor government in Brazil, has started affirmative action program.  And have started in open discussion on this question of race in Brazil because in Brazil, it's hard to find someone to say they're "Afro-Brazilian," number one, okay.  Secondly, if you got money, that clouds the picture.  As they say in Brazil-"money lightens you," so if you got money, you're no longer dark, you're white.  All right, so that's a complicated kind of issue.  Then the mulattoes are all always a separate group.  See, that never developed in the United States--a person who was mixed.  But in Brazil, it did, okay.  So it's, it's, it's a different situation.  You, in other words, you can't go to Brazil looking at them in American eyesight--black and white, and all that kind of stuff.  It's just different.  It's--they have a different history.  So they just, they're just really coming to grips with the issue of race really in Brazil.
Story_ID: 117620
Speaker 1: Now, what about Cuba?
Speaker 2: Now, that's a different--.  What can I say?  I could say a whole lot about Cuba.  Over half the population is of African descent.  The people who have benefitted the most in Cuba have been the black Cubans, and that's who Fidel's [Fidel Castro] main support is, is the black Cubans.  The reason being is simple.  After the revolution, they announced some special programs on this issue of race in Cuba.  One was to give the dark-skinned Cubans double pay for twenty-five years in terms of their pay, okay, because they took the position--materially speaking, the, the darkest-skinned Cubans had less than the whiter Cubans.  Many of the big houses in Cuba after the revolution, they took to open up the schools and daycare centers, and this kind of stuff.  Those Cubans left.  That was the first wave, and went to Miami [Florida] and so forth.  Then they went on a 25-year span to build the schools, hospitals, daycare centers, first in the black areas for 25 years because this was a material condition.  Then they passed a very strict law against racism.  I mean, it's like, I think, life imprisonment if you show any signs of racism, okay.  So, yes, you still have racism in Cuba.  I mean, that does exist in Cuba.  I'm not denying that.  But it is very, very different, okay.  I mean, when Fidel was here two or three years ago in New York [New York City, New York], the Congressional Black Caucus asked him about medicine in Cuba.  And Fidel said that he would fin-, the government would finance 500 Americans a year, minorities, to study medicine in Cuba, and they would pay the costs.  It--the only requirement was is that they have to come back here and serve in under-represented areas, okay.  That program started a year and a half, two years ago.  Already, there are about 400 Americans in Cuba that's doing that.  Now, the Cuban medical system is recognized as one of the best in the world.  So all they have to do is take the foreign entrance exam when you come back here, okay, because the American Medical Association recognizes the Cuban Medical Association, all right.  So, in terms of the issue of race in Cuba, there's all kinds of discussions on it.  They admit it's still there, but it is a whole lot better than here in terms--and the ones who benefitted the most are the darker Cubans.  And that's who Fidel's support is, is the darker Cubans.  Now, there are economic, there are economic problems because it's a boycott, and people want to--some people want to leave because of the economic reasons and so forth.  But, see, a lot of darker Cubans don't have any rel-, relatives here, so they can't send them no money.  The white Cubans, yes, they can send money to the island.  The darker Cubans, they don't have many relatives in this country so, so they've handled it in a dras-, a different way, in terms of this issue of race and so forth.  And Fidel has often said, particularly when he sent those troops to Angola, you know, remember that in the Angolan [Civil] War and so forth.  Fidel has often said if you scratch me, I'm Africa underneath, all right.  So, you know, the Cubans, you know, Assata [Shakur] is in Cuba and secure.  And we talked with her, I think, last time and so forth.  She's very happy down there.  Her family comes.  She, she's not coming back to the United States.  But her family, you know, comes to, to visit her in Cuba.  She had some kind of government job or something, I forgot, photography or something of that nature and so forth.  So, yeah, Cuba is one of my favorite places.  And everybody's there.  The place is full of tourists, except Americans.  Every--the Europeans are there, everybody's there.  Latins are there because it's the cheapest place in the Caribbean.  There are hardly no crime or drugs and it's safe.
Speaker 1: That, that says a lot.
Speaker 2: Right.  You know, if you talk about just a (unclear) Caribbean vacation, if that's all you're talking about, yes, go to Cuba, plus the music is great.
Story_ID: 90243
Speaker 1: Sir, what, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Well, I think we kinda like, in the lull in terms of the struggle and so forth.  But I think that the future, in my opinion, looks good.  You know, you don't need one leader, you need a lot of leaders in the black--I keep telling people, don't be waiting for some messiah to come along and so forth, nor do you need everybody, you know.  You are never going to get everybody and so forth.  We never got everybody in the Civil Rights Movement and so forth.
Speaker 1: You can't wait for them.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you can't wait for that.  You have to take the initiative and move and so forth.  And I think that's what people have to do, but people are kinda like in a lull now, either a shock from, a setback from the last election [2000] nationwide, or this war [Iraq War] and so forth.  But I think, I think things in the future will pick up as soon as things change and so on.  So I have great hope for our community.  And I think it's, it's not just the black community so much also, it's the white community, too.  I think they have shared many of the same kind of concerns, maybe on a different kind of way, but, no, I, I think, things, in my opinion, the future looks good.
Story_ID: 90244
Speaker 1: Okay.  Sir, what would you consider right now is your legacy?
Speaker 2: Never thought about it, never thought about it really.  I guess it will be my work with the ANC [African National Congress], okay, but I've never thought about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And how, this is a little different from legacy, but how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As a person who struggles, as a person who doesn't take what the government says or the media, as a person who questions things and struggles.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did your mother [Harriette Patricia Rogers] get a chance and your father [Harold Rogers] get a chance to see you become successful after those trying school days and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, my parents did, yeah, 'cause they didn't die until my father died in the '70's [1970s], and my mother a couple of years ago, and so forth.  But, yes, uh-hum, yeah, they got to saw--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were they pretty, were they (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Uh-hum, uh-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 2: Just speak?
