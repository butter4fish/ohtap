Speaker 1: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV):  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Cleveland, Ohio (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, Cleveland, Ohio, okay now what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back you trace that side first of all?
Speaker 2: Probably can go back maybe two generations.  I think two generations.
Speaker 1: Okay, well what are the stories from that side of?
Speaker 2: The stories?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Like what?
Speaker 1: Going back, those two generations--now the family from what I understand goes back to Wilmington, North Carolina on his side, the Taylors (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, the Taylors.
Story_ID: 589185
Speaker 1: Tell us something about them?
Speaker 2: Well my [maternal] grandfather was an architect who went to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and finished in 1892?  Is that correct?
Speaker 1: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV):  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Now this is Robert Robinson?
Speaker 1: Robert Robinson Taylor.
Speaker 2: Taylor, right?  And he grew up in Wilmington, North Carolina, right?  And now there's something from what I understand--now, I've interviewed other members of your family.  It's something interesting about his background, right?  About his father [Henry Taylor] and some other things--can you?
Speaker 1: His father?
Speaker 2: Yeah, can you elaborate on some of that?
Speaker 1: I'm not sure what those would be.
Speaker 2: What do you know--okay?
Speaker 1: Well he went to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].
Speaker 2: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV):  (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Yeah, his father was in construction and probably why he got his interest in architecture.  His mother [Emily Still Taylor] was one of five children I think, originally from Louisiana.  He lived in Wilmington, North Carolina and he came to Tuskegee to help Booker T. Washington start the cam- build buildings for the campus, and that would've been in the '20s [1920s], right?
Speaker 2: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV):  (Unclear).
Speaker 1: I think the early '20s [1920s].  I'm not quite sure of the date that he came down there originally.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And he would.
Speaker 2: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV):  (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Yeah, 1900 probably and he remained there and worked with Booker T. Washington in building the campus until he retired and moved back to Wilmington, North Carolina where he lived until he died.
Speaker 2: Now I understand the first African American graduate of MIT in architecture, I believe that that's true.
Speaker 1: I think he was.
Speaker 2: Right, and is there any interesting story about he got in that position in the first place?
Speaker 1: You mean to go to?
Speaker 2: Yes, 'cause I, there weren't any other African Americans at MIT.  Is there a story about how he got into MIT?
Speaker 1: No, I don't know the story about that, but I, I do know I think he was the only one to graduate at that time.
Speaker 2: Okay and so he was invited to Tuskegee by Booker T. himself?
Speaker 1: To help build the campus.
Speaker 2: Okay all right, now--well, now his--that's your, now this is your great--this is your great-grandfather?
Speaker 1: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV):  Grandfather.
Speaker 2: My grandfather.
Speaker 1: Grandfather, okay and okay and so is your mother's [Helen Taylor Dibble] side of the family the Taylors and so.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Your--so this is your mother's father?
Speaker 2: That's my mother's father.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay all right.  Any other members of the family, any stories about them you wanna tell?
Speaker 2: Well I don't know that there are any other stories except you know family stories that aren't probably related to his history.  I, I think that he had a--my sense about him is that he had a very interesting life, and that he lost his wife [Beatrice Rochon Taylor] early in their marriage and remarried [Nellie Chesnutt Taylor] and then moved back to North Carolina for the rest of his life and he had a--we actually had a wonderful relationship for he had a house in Wilmington proper and then he had a house at Wrightsville Beach [North Carolina] and every summer the whole family would meet there and it was a wonderful experience.  We got to know all of our relatives very well on our mother's side 'cause we spent this time with him and he lived on--at Wrightsville he lived on the sound part and you'd take the boat over to the ocean which we loved to do.  So we have great memories of him as being a very generous and interested grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay, so was your mother--now she was born in Cleveland [Ohio] but--
Speaker 2: She was born in Cleveland before they moved to North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV):  (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Oh, back to Tuskegee and then.
Speaker 2: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV):  (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV):  (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Oh, okay so.
Speaker 2: So she met him in Tuskegee and then he went back after he retired to.
Speaker 1: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV):  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV):  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Cleveland.
Speaker 1: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV)  And returned to Tuskegee.
Speaker 2: And returned to Tuskegee.
Speaker 1: This is your sister Clarice [HistoryMaker Clarice Dibble Walker, IV] off camera talking to (laughter), yeah, we're, yeah she's the family historian, and she's saying that he you know after he graduated from MIT I guess he was in Cleveland before he went to Tuskegee and then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes and then he went.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Went back.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.
Story_ID: 589186
Speaker 1: Your mother's family basically was raised--you know grew up around Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] is that--?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, did your mother [Helen Taylor Dibble] have any stories in growing up that she shared with you?  That you remember?
Speaker 2: No, but I think my mother had great love for Tuskegee because of growing up there and I think they had a very close family and I think she had you know sort of a normal family life where in black families at that time one of the great things that everybody encouraged people to do was to become educated 'cause they saw that a way out or a way to deal with prejudice.
Speaker 1: Okay, did she have any reflections on Booker T. Washington?  Did she ever meet him?
Speaker 2: Well, I think she was quite young when he was around and though she had some memories of it.  I don't think they were very defined in terms of a relationship.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV):  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, her father [Robert Robinson Taylor] worked for him but, yeah.
Speaker 1: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV):  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: She knew the children and the grandchildren, she knew the next generations.
Speaker 1: Right, right and I--Booker T. Washington lived until 1915, so she was born 1901, about fifteen years ago.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah you can see him coming and going, and your grandfather built The Oaks [Tuskegee, Alabama] his residence from what I understand right?
Speaker 2: The what?
Speaker 1: The Oaks?
Speaker 2: The Oaks, yes.  He probably was the architect for the most of the buildings in that time period.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, now she didn't--I mean I'm just trying to get you know what she might have shared about growing up in Tuskegee in those days, what it was like for her to grow up on that campus with all that activity?
Speaker 2: I think it was unusual in the sense of here you are in the middle of the South where education for blacks had been very limited and Booker T. Washington had this goal and he achieved his goal in large part of providing a place that people could be, could reach, could be educated and finish college and go onto a better life, and I think that, that idea and that effort was always a big part of the experience of living in Tuskegee, the importance of getting an education, of being able to contribute and work in a society that had not been friendly to blacks, but in fact where blacks were determined to succeed.
Speaker 1: Okay, did she have any stories about meeting any of the celebrities from those days?  'Cause this is not--you may take this for granted but most people don't grow up on a campus where they know Booker T. Washington and the other notables of the--that period of time.
Speaker 2: Well, we did, we had a very interesting life because they of course entertained a lot of people who came to visit Tuskegee, so even though we lived in a small town we heard Marian Anderson sing 'cause she sang at the college campus 'cause they couldn't sing in most places.  So we had the great experience of seeing a lot of people from the bigger world who came to Tuskegee to perform, and that was a different experience than most people had in the South living in, in segregated communities.
Speaker 1: Okay now did your mother go to school at Tuskegee herself as a child?
Speaker 2: As a--yeah, she went to school in Tuskegee and then she went to Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] to college.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right and what did she major in at Fisk?
Speaker 2: I think socio [sociology].
Speaker 1: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV):  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Music, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your mother was a music major?  Did she play--was she an expert on any particular instrument?
Speaker 2: She's a very good pianist.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In fact we have her piano, I have it right there.
Speaker 1: Oh you're right--okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: It's in the living room.
Speaker 1: In the living room, okay.
Story_ID: 589187
Speaker 1: Let me ask about your father's side of the family.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Eugene Heriot Dibble [Eugene H. Dibble, Jr.].
Speaker 1: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV): Junior.
Speaker 2: Hm?  Junior--oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, Eugene Heriot Dibble.
Speaker 2: H-E-R-I-O-T.
Speaker 1: Okay, H-E-R-I-O-T, oh okay all right.  Is there--now is a story behind that name?  That's kind of an unusual name.
Speaker 2: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV):  (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Yeah, it, it was his father, he was a junior.  It was his father's name.
Speaker 2: Okay, but is there a story behind it because I've never heard that name before H-E-R-I-O-T?
Speaker 1: I think Heriot was the maiden name of his mother.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: What?
Speaker 2: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV):  In his family
Speaker 1: In his family.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay all right, and what was his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 1: August--wait--I was the 13th, 14th.
Speaker 2: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV):  (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Eighteen ninety-three [1893]?
Speaker 2: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV):  (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay August 14, 1893 and well, what can you tell us about your father's side of the family?  What about the Dibbles?  How far back can you trace them and, and what stories are passed down?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know how far we can trace the Dibbles.
Speaker 1: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV): Far back.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it goes way back.
Speaker 1: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV): There are family members who've traced that history all the way back.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't know how far back they go, but they have traced it, maybe my sister Clarice [HistoryMaker Clarice Dibble Walker, IV] can.
Speaker 1: Okay well when we're one on one. She can talk about it.
Speaker 2: Tell you.
Speaker 1: She can talk about it.
Speaker 2: She knows more about it?
Speaker 1: Talk about it but where are they from and what condition--I mean were they free people of color back--way, way, way back or were they slaves or what?  What was their--do you have any idea?
Speaker 2: Well I never heard about any of the slavery, I've only heard of them being free.
Speaker 1: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV):  But we know they were slaves because we have their freedom papers.
Speaker 2: Papers, we have freedom papers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I don't know the, you know when they got free as opposed to the different ages.
Speaker 1: Okay they had to have papers.
Speaker 2: I would imagine that my grandmother always lived as a free person.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I would think so but way, way back when they, they wouldn't have freedom papers unless you know slavery was still going on.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know so they were freed during the--while the country was still engaged in slavery.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Before 1865 we can say that safely I guess.  And what did the Dibbles do what were they like?
Speaker 2: They were, they really were good citizens of the community in the sense you know, I think that their standards were high about that.  When we knew them, I mean they were economically advantaged at that point.  My grandfather's generation he did very well.  He owned property and a very nice house and.
Speaker 1: What was your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: His name was.
Speaker 1: Oh, the same, Eugene Dibble [Eugene H. Dibble, Sr.].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: But our grandparents as we knew them had a very comfortable house, a very nice house, quite large--sort of across from a park and--.
Speaker 1: This is in?
Speaker 2: Camden [South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Camden?
Speaker 2: We had relatives in Sumter, South Carolina and Camden.
Speaker 1: Now is there a story about how they became so well off?
Speaker 2: I don't know that story so well.  I do know that I think because of my grandmother and some of the--I think she was probably growing up, better off than my grandfather was and I think some of the property was originally hers, wasn't it?
Speaker 1: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV):  I think he was a merchant.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he had a store.
Speaker 1: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV):  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: In the middle of the town.
Speaker 1: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV):  And did very well.
Speaker 2: Store.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right now what did your grand--so your grandfather ran a store?
Speaker 2: My grandmother's name was Sallie Lee Dibble.
Speaker 1: Okay, Sallie Lee.
Speaker 2: Isn't that right?
Speaker 1: Dibble.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay so she was a Lee okay--was that her maiden name Lee?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay so okay, is there a story from her side of the family about how you know--
Speaker 2: Well, I think his side of the family was mixed too, wasn't it?  The Dibbles?
Speaker 1: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV):  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: I think.
Speaker 1: Okay so.
Speaker 2: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV):  (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Yeah, we don't, we don't know a lot about her.
Story_ID: 589188
Speaker 1: Your father [Eugene H. Dibble, Jr.] became a doctor, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Is it, how did he, well is there a story about how he got to medical school, and how he chose to be, you know to become a doctor 'cause that's a really big thing, and especially in those days, 'cause there weren't many black doctors at all.
Speaker 2: Well, you know with black families during that period and of course now too, education was the key to everything.  I mean if you didn't have any skills you couldn't survive very well as a black in the South and so I think families who could encourage their children to become educated and I'm certain that his mother [Sallie Lee Dibble] and father [Eugene H. Dibble, Sr.] would have.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV):  (Unclear).
Speaker 1: All of the kids went to college--pardon?
Speaker 2: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV):  (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Did he start at Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 1: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV):  To college.
Speaker 2: To college and they went to Howard to medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay Atlanta U then Howard. Did he have any stories about growing up or about you know going through medical school and--he shared with you?
Speaker 2: Well, I think he really enjoyed medical school, I think he liked you know the camaraderie of his friends and he was committed to medicine and he loved being a doctor.  He didn't mind the long hours, he was very involved with it and late in life when he came to Tuskegee [Alabama], he was head of a hospital there, John Andrew Hospital [John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital], and then he was head of the veterans hospital [Tuskegee Veterans Administration Medical Center; Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System-East Campus, Tuskegee, Alabama] and he was in the [U.S.] Army during the Second World War [World War II, WWII].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As a colonel.
Speaker 1: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV):  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: So he's a colonel in World War II?
Speaker 2: World War II.
Speaker 1: Okay, now there is a.
Speaker 2: My older sister [Helen Dibble Cannady] loved it because she was old enough and they had all the cadets at the Army air base [Tuskegee Army Airfield; Sharpe Field, Tuskegee, Alabama] and every weekend we had a house full.  My mother [Helen Taylor Dibble] and father's friends who were in the Army and they'd come to Tuskegee in the segregated [U.S.] Armed Forces and they--we, they spent a lot of time (laughter) and, because of the Tuskegee Airmen.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they had the project at the Tuskegee field, right.  They became Tuskegee Airmen.
Story_ID: 589189
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents met that they tell?
Speaker 2: If it is I don't know that story.  Well my father [Eugene H. Dibble, Jr.] came there after he finished his residency to practice and met my mother [Helen Taylor Dibble] then.
Speaker 1: Okay, to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay all right.
Speaker 2: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV):  (Unclear).
Speaker 1: But she came back, she was working in Denver [Colorado] at that time.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But she came back to visit her family.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, and so when you think about your parents' gifts and their personalities and their dispositions and talents and--who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I don't know.  I, I think probably a combination of both.  They were both very independent people.  My mother was, I mean she literally--she ran the house by herself, there's no question about it, and all that it involved in it and but they were fun.  It was fun to be around them.  They were always interested in doing things and it was always fun to be there.  We always had--during the Second World War [World War II, WWII] we use to--our house was filed all the time with friends of theirs, and kids who had come to Tuskegee in the [U.S.] Army and, and that was fun.  We were all and, and we all loved that.  It's the certain excitement of having all of these new people come to town and it was, it was a wonderful time and my father and mother were very devoted to each other and very protective of each other and it was a very nice relationship to grow up in.
Story_ID: 589190
Speaker 1: How many brothers and sisters do you have?
Speaker 2: I have four.

Speaker 2: Also we had a lot of cousins too and we're all very close too.
Speaker 1: That were there in Tuskegee [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: No, but every summer we were, we visited.
Speaker 1: Okay, so.
Speaker 2: We have a huge family.
Story_ID: 589191
Speaker 1: Now you grew up in Tuskegee [Alabama], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we grew up there (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay. Now do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: In Tuskegee?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh I do because the houses where we lived my father [Eugene H. Dibble, Jr.]--when my father was head of the veterans hospital [Tuskegee Veterans Administration Medical Center; Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System-East Campus, Tuskegee, Alabama] there we lived on a place called the circle and they had all these houses around that the doctors lived on, and in the middle of the circle were these huge trees, pine trees but they had--the last branch, was--as children we could go under so we would play in the circle all the time.  Hide in the trees, we had treehouses we had every--it was a really great place for kids to grow up.  I mean you could go out and play all day by yourself with your friends (laughter) and nobody worried.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay.
Speaker 2: Which is quite different from today.
Story_ID: 589192
Speaker 1: All right, now can you describe--so this is basically 'cause you ask people to describe the neighborhood they grew up in.  Well you grew up on campus [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], right?
Speaker 2: No we didn't grow up on the campus basically.
Speaker 1: Okay so did you grow up in town?
Speaker 2: We grew up just outside, my father [Eugene H. Dibble, Jr.] was head of the hospital when we grew up.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then he went back, when he resigned he went back and they bought a house you know in the town and so we spent a lot of time there but we both all grown by then.
Speaker 1: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV):  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: It wasn't.
Speaker 1: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV):  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV):  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: The hospital back to campus.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When he retired--when he resigned from that.
Speaker 1: So in and around the campus anyway?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah okay, now can you describe the house you lived in for us?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a big old house (laughter); it's a very nice house, big old house right off the campus.
Speaker 1: Okay was it a house built by your [maternal] grandfather [Robert Robinson Taylor]?
Speaker 2: No. Okay. I mean I don't know if he did the design of it, but I don't know that he did that.
Story_ID: 589193
Speaker 1: We always ask this question, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up [in Tuskegee, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Sights and sounds and smells?  Well there was always something good in our house, but the sights we loved.  I mean things like on Sundays the students would march to chapel with the band and so we'd come out of our Sunday school to watch them march to chapel, which was always fun 'cause it--I mean you know you, you saw the whole student body going, marching to chapel which quite unusual when you think about it now, but also growing up I think about the freedom we had to play and we could go out and play you know, people wouldn't want--you know your neighbors were cognizant of what going on around.  We didn't have to have play dates as opposed to the way kids live now.  We just went outside, it was always somebody to play with which is quite different from the way kids live now and I think because of that you become much more independent earlier.
Story_ID: 589194
Speaker 1: I just wanted to note that we are joined by Clarice Walker [HistoryMaker Clarice Dibble Walker, IV] that's, you know, our subject's sister off camera, but okay so we were talking about the sights and sounds and smells of growing up and you were talking about the freedom that you had growing up to play, and.
Speaker 2: Oh I think that was terrific.  I mean it's an unusual experience that you can live with that kind of freedom for children.  I mean today that's sort of unheard of that children can be out all day playing and you not worry about it.  The other thing the advantage that we had is because kids--there were kids there all ages.  I think you could--and they sort of watched over you.  They took, you know if they were out they took care of you and there was this sense of, of being protected.  I don't think we ever worried about anything and I don't think we were ever questioned about anything, do you? I mean I don't think so, I think we were, we were really free to try to do as much as we were able to do.
Story_ID: 589195
Speaker 1: Now, when I think of Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] myself and the things I've read I think about a very you know structured program for the students, as you said they marched to chapel you know.  I think they had to go to chapel once a day, right?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think--it was on Sundays.
Speaker 1: Just on Sundays?  Okay.
Speaker 2: But the other part about the chapel which was wonderful was they had that wonderful choir director there, William Dawson [William Levi Dawson], you know who did most of the real big arrangements that choirs used even to this day, and they had fabulous music, they had wonderful speakers from all over who came different Sundays to speak.  So as you got older you really sort of looked forward to it because you began to really devise some taste about (laughter) good speakers and bad speakers.  It was interesting how people could hold your attention and--it was--I was always impressed with people that you would sat and you listened to every word they said, and then you'd listen to some and you'd just turn off right away, but it was a good experience 'cause we heard people speak from all over the country.
Speaker 1: Now did you have a favorite speaker?  I mean can you give us an example of some--give us an example of somebody that really liked to hear?
Speaker 2: Oh there was a guy--one of the ministers there, Harvey, he was fabulous and he, he had the way of speaking that he talked the higher things in life but he also talked about everyday life and he melded them and I thought that was always--you always learned something when you walked out.  There are some speakers you know you walk out and you think about it and you've--there's something you remember about them.  They had a lot of those and I, I remember that.
Speaker 1: Okay, his last name was Harvey?
Speaker 2: His name was Chunky Harvey, remember?
Speaker 1: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV):  Raymond.
Speaker 2: Raymond (laughter), you remember the name?
Speaker 1: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV):  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: They call him Chunky, huh?
Speaker 1: Down south they use to have nicknames for everyone (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, now I've never heard of him before, Raymond Chunky Harvey [Raymond Harvey].

Speaker 1: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV):  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, perhaps yeah, okay, Raymond Chunky Harvey.  You know of all the people now (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Walter--Raymond (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, I thought you might of said James Weldon Johnson or somebody you know famous or something, but this is a your--okay, Reverend Harvey?  And he was a pastor?
Speaker 1: He was the chaplain there.
Speaker 2: The chaplain at the?
Speaker 1: At the.
Speaker 2: At Tuskegee?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.

Speaker 2: Well--but the fortunate thing is that we had the advantages of the campus, so we all loved to swim.  We use to have a swimming show at the end of the season, the summer season where you'd swim with flashlights on your ankles and arms and did all kinds (laughter) of swimming for them.  So that was fun.  We had the tennis which was fun, which was right there, playing, but the main thing about Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] was the freedom to play whatever you wanted to.  I mean there was always somebody who would play with you and that was nice.  I mean you didn't have to have as we have now if children wanna play you have to plan it.
Speaker 1: So you were like an outgoing little girl basically.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we all did--we spent almost a whole day outdoors.

Speaker 1: At Northfield, now where's Northfield?
Speaker 2: East Northfield, Massachusetts, it's on the border of Vermont and New Hampshire.
Speaker 1: Okay all right.  So do you understand, I mean when you look back at it what was the reason they would send you to Northfield instead of having you finish at Tuskegee?
Speaker 2: Having a better school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they thought you'd get a better education there than at Tuskegee?  Okay, were you excited about going or were you?
Speaker 2: Yes, my older sister [Helen Dibble Cannady] had been and my brothers [HistoryMaker Eugene H. Dibble, III and Robert Dibble] had been to Mount Hermon [Mount Hermon School for Boys; Northfield Mount Hermon School, Gill, Massachusetts] which was a boys school.
Speaker 1: Okay, did any other Tuskegee students go?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah there were a lot of 'em who went away to--not a lot but some went, away to high school.
Speaker 1: Okay to--any to Northfield with you or you--
Speaker 2: Yeah some of 'em went to Northfield, some went to Mount Hermon.
Speaker 1: But when you went, were you the only one from Tuskegee (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Some of 'em went to Palmer Memorial [Alice Freeman Palmer Memorial Institute, Sedalia, North Carolina], which was the school in North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay, what I'm asking is how many went with you when you went to Northfield?
Speaker 2: No one else went with me when I went to Northfield.
Speaker 1: Okay, was there anybody else there from Tuskegee when you got there?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But a friend of mine was there from Washington [D.C.], Anna Faith Johnston, Anna Diggs [Anna Diggs Taylor], she lives in Chicago [Illinois] now.
Speaker 1: Okay, so were you all, how many other black students were there?  I mean I guess by--?
Speaker 2: When I was at Northfield?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I think about four.
Speaker 1: Okay, this was a girls school basically?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, Mount Hermon was the boys school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was across the river.
Speaker 1: All right so it's four black girls there at Northfield.  So what was that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Delores Carrig [ph.] was there.
Speaker 1: So what was that experience like, did you like it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had a good time, yeah, I, I loved it there.
Speaker 1: Okay,
Speaker 2: I had to get use to the cold but.
Speaker 1: So they were pretty friendly and they were.
Speaker 2: They are very friendly.
Speaker 1: And accepting?  Okay.
Speaker 2: They are very.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, all right.
Speaker 2: The one thing they didn't like was that my father [Eugene H. Dibble, Jr.] would call and he would always call late at night (laughter) when he got home from work and I--this--I had a housemother whose name was Ms. Titcom [ph.] so you know what everybody did with that name.  She'd (laughter) come wake up, she--, "This is your father again.  He just doesn't seem to learn that you can't call this late."
Speaker 1: Okay, would he, did he call on a regular basis then?
Speaker 2: Yeah my father would--he kept in touch.
Story_ID: 589203
Speaker 1: Were you involved in high school activities first at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and then at Northfield [Northfield School for Girls; Northfield Mount Hermon School, Gill, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know we played team sports there.
Speaker 1: Okay, now we don't know now that's why I'm asking 'cause I don't know I mean.
Speaker 2: No, they had team sports and we played team sports and I think I sang in the choir.
Speaker 1: At Northfield or?
Speaker 2: Northfield.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you do the same thing at Tuskegee?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right did you have a--what was your favorite sport?
Speaker 2: Well tennis is my--was my favorite sport but you had to play all the sports there (laughter) you know fall, winter sports.
Speaker 1: Yeah okay, what kind of sports do they play in a--I mean, now I've never been to a girls school.  I know what boys would play, but I don't know what girls would play necessarily.
Speaker 2: All the--they had all the sports activities you could you know all of the ones.
Speaker 1: Basketball?
Speaker 2: You could play basketball.
Speaker 1: Soccer, I don't know if soccer--
Speaker 2: Oh soccer is very big.
Speaker 1: I imagine football was not (laughter).
Speaker 2: No but soccer--I would--there was a lot of soccer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Tennis.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You could ski there because it was very hilly if you wanted to ski down the hills you could.
Story_ID: 589204
Speaker 1: What was the difference, when you look back at it, what was the difference between being at Northfield [Northfield School for Girls; Northfield Mount Hermon School, Gill, Massachusetts] and being at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] for high school?
Speaker 2: Was quality of the education that made the difference.
Speaker 1: So you could really sense that as a kid going to school?
Speaker 2: No, my parents [Helen Taylor Dibble and Eugene H. Dibble, Jr.] assessed that (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean I'm talking about your assessment of that--?
Speaker 2: Yeah 'cause I had a harder time there than I had at Tuskegee.
Speaker 1: So there--the curriculum was steep, I mean the
Speaker 2: It was very--it was a much broader curriculum, it was difficult.
Speaker 1: You think it was as difficult for those who'd already been to those kind of schools before you know?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that when you go to a boarding school, they can hand select.  I mean they can select who they wanna have come there so they tend to select kids that they think can succeed, and so I think that the education can you know--you design a program for that as opposed to if you have a broad--you have to take everyone that's a totally different.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it's also--well remember in the South and the South wasn't allocating much money for black schools then.  That was part of the problem.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right so did you have a favorite subject in high school?
Speaker 2: I can't remember that I did.
Speaker 1: So you had a more of a generalist?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah, you had--they said what you had to take.  You had some choice about languages maybe, but it was a prescribed curriculum.
Speaker 1: Okay, was it heavy on sciences or the arts or what?
Speaker 2: No it was--I mean it was a general curriculum.  You had to take everything, I mean--but they had a lot of choices in with each field that you could take.  So, but you, you know pretty much had to take a standard course.
Speaker 1: Okay, so was there any particular thing that you focused in on more than something--than another thing?
Speaker 2: No, I'm not sure that I focused in on--you know because I had to take 'em all.  You had to take certain courses to graduate and that's what I had to do.  I thought some of the quality of the teaching was better.
Speaker 1: Okay did you have a favorite teacher at Northfield?
Speaker 2: At Northfield, no not really that I can remember.  I think they were all very good, and they really--Northfield the teachers really lived on campus so they spent a lot of time with the kids so you got to know faculty pretty well.
Speaker 1: Were the class--was the class size small?
Speaker 2: Yeah, small.
Speaker 1: Okay all right and okay--so did you run for class office or anything like that when you were there [Northfield School for Girls; Northfield Mount Hermon School, Gill, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: No, I can't--I think I was class something my senior year, but I can't remember what it was, but it--there wasn't a lot of you know--I think I was class secretary or something like that, but I don't think it was much emphasis on that.
Story_ID: 589205
Speaker 1: Any stories about you know your social life there at Northfield [Northfield School for Girls; Northfield Mount Hermon School, Gill, Massachusetts] or?
Speaker 2: Well it was difficult for black kids because that was before there was that much integration, but there were black students at Mount Hermon [Mount Hermon School for Boys; Northfield Mount Hermon School, Gill, Massachusetts], which was the school associated with them. There were a lot of--there were black kids with black ties there.  So you had you know dates if you wanted them, but there was not a lot of dating there (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know there were parties when they--you could have dates and all, most of the time it was on the campus.
Speaker 1: Okay did they have a prom at all?
Speaker 2: I think they did.
Speaker 1: Okay it wasn't very significant if you can't remember it (laughter).
Speaker 2: You know how long ago that was (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Yes, but we're only in high school once, you know.  We're only in high school once you know.  You're only in high school once really and you know and I just (unclear).
Speaker 2: I think, I think I had a prom, but I had a good time there because I liked that kind of life.  They were involved in sports and all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was fun.
Speaker 1: All right, so well when you were a senior what were your prospects for school?  What were you thinking about in terms of--and had it all been planned out for you or did you have a?
Speaker 2: No, you were involved a lot in what you know you decided to do.
Story_ID: 589206
Speaker 1: So what were you thinking about doing on--at that time?
Speaker 2: Well I applied to all the--I, I think I applied to the schools and I was looking forward to college and I wasn't disappointed.
Speaker 1: Okay, well how did you choose the college that you attended?
Speaker 2: I chose Vassar [Vassar College, Poughkeepsie, New York] 'cause a friend of mine was going to Vassar too and they were very nice when they were doing they--when they came up to you know interview people.
Speaker 1: Okay so.
Speaker 2: I think on that basis probably.
Speaker 1: Okay, you didn't have any idea, any other choice or any idea of going someplace else other than Vassar?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah I'm sure I applied to a lot of schools, everybody did then.
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm just thinking your parents [Helen Taylor Dibble and Eugene H. Dibble, Jr.] were probably really involved in this too I would guess, is that true?
Speaker 2: Well the good thing about it was up there you had a counselor who worked with you at that so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You did everything there.
Speaker 1: All right so.
Speaker 2: I mean my parents encouraged me to go and wanted me to go to college, but I don't think they had any choices about it.
Speaker 1: Okay, they didn't have a preference?  They didn't want you to go to this college.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Or that college?  Okay, so well, what was--what year did you graduate from high school [Northfield School for Girls; Northfield Mount Hermon School, Gill, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: I graduated from high school in, let's see I graduated from college '55 [1955]--'51 [1951].
Story_ID: 589207
Speaker 1: Fall of 1951 you started Vassar [Vassar College, Poughkeepsie, New York]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, now how did--what were your impressions of Vassar?  Had you been there before, before you started college?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, I liked it.  We had a really good group of girls on our freshmen corridor and we ended up together in our senior housing, so it was fun.

We have some kind of reunion so it's nice, but also my friends from Northfield [Northfield School for Girls; Northfield Mount Hermon School, Gill, Massachusetts], Anna Faith Johnston, Anna Taylor Diggs [sic.

Speaker 2: Oh, yeah Joan Bunche was ahead of me at Vassar, and we had a good time.
Speaker 1: Any stories about Vassar that?
Speaker 2: Well, it, it was a terrific college, it's in a small college town and because of that a lot of weekends kids went off you know, went off campus but a lot of--they had a lot of visitors on campus.  Boys would come over from the neighboring schools and they--some departments were really excellent economics, the arts, and we've maintained this--I lived in the South Tower and there were ten of us in there and we've stayed friends and we just had a--we have a reunion every year, get together in New York a lot, so we--you know maintain friendships.
Speaker 1: Okay and so how many African American students or were there other African American students at (unclear) Vassar?
Speaker 2: Yeah there were when I was there.
Speaker 1: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV): Patsy Fleming.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Patsy Fleming [Patricia Stubbs Fleming] and a girl named Carol Bennett [ph.] but she didn't stay, Joan Bunche.  I think that is about all while I was there (laughter).  You know who are still--that I see at any time.  Most of 'em were behind me actually.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were there from '51 [1951] to '55 [1955] I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I went in the fall of '51 [1951] and I graduated in June of '55 [1955].
Speaker 1: Now what was your major?

Speaker 1: When you were coming up did you keep up with some of the events in the Civil Rights Movement when you were coming up?  Did you read the black newspapers (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: And--I guess right there at Tuskegee [Alabama] you would?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But did?
Speaker 2: Tuskegee was very (laughter)--but the thing about Tuskegee was that economically it was the black community that was advantageous to the white community I mean there was a very small white community, almost nothing that you would--I mean if you think about it except for the banks.
Speaker 1: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV):  The movies.
Speaker 2: The movies.
Speaker 1: The movies were controlled by whites or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, one time but then you could go to the movies on the campus [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].
Speaker 1: Where the--was there any tension between the whites in the town of Tuskegee and black people?
Speaker 2: Not really.
Speaker 1: On campus.
Speaker 2: I don't think they could afford to be much, do you?
Speaker 1: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV):  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: I mean I think they didn't like it.
Speaker 1: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV):  It was segregated.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV): It was segregated.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The town was segregated, you say? Tuskegee?  Okay.  Was it different in Massachusetts, I mean in the town?  I mean how did they feel about black folks in the town?
Speaker 2: Massachusetts?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Northfield [Northfield School for Girls; Northfield Mount Hermon School, Gill, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Oh, there wasn't any segregation there because there weren't any blacks there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In the town.
Speaker 1: So none lived in the town?
Speaker 2: None that I knew of.
Speaker 1: So they didn't think to segregate you all if you all came to town?
Speaker 2: Well you know the family, the Johnston family--is it Johnston?
Speaker 1: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV):  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Johnston family in Keene, New Hampshire who lived as white.  You didn't know that story?
Speaker 1: Tell us?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) So they--it was a book 'Lost Boundaries' [William Lindsay White] did you ever read that book.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: 'Lost Boundaries'?
Speaker 1: Well that's what it was about?
Speaker 2: And it was about this family that lived as white and they had been black all those years.
Speaker 1: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV):  Whatever it's been done.
Speaker 2: Yeah, (laughter) all over, I mean they were black and they lived as white in this town and yet they had black friends 'cause their, their--her sister, the wife's sister lived in Tuskegee.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And but they lived all those years and finally there was this book 'Lost Boundaries.'
Speaker 1: Where did they live in?
Speaker 2: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV):  (Unclear).
Speaker 1: They lived in Keene, New Hampshire.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in Keene, New Hampshire.  All right but every--all their neighbors thought they were white?
Speaker 1: I guess, okay and they looked very light I guess?
Speaker 2: They did, well one you might of thought was.  Remember?
Speaker 1: One you might?
Speaker 2: If she lived in a black community you wouldn't of thought she--you would of thought she was black.
Speaker 1: But in Keene, New Hampshire they didn't?
Speaker 2: There was nobody else you know.
Speaker 1: Okay so in those towns--now Vassar [Vassar College] is located where?
Speaker 2: In Poughkeepsie.
Speaker 1: In Poughkeepsie, New York and there were--I take it there's a black community in Poughkeepsie, right?
Speaker 2: Very small one, very small black community there.
Speaker 1: How were black folks treated in Poughkeepsie as such?
Speaker 2: There was, there was no problem there but I think because it was such a small community.  There was never was an issue.
Speaker 1: Okay, now are there any stories now--if--you know this is 1951 to '55 [1955] now and you're in a small town in New York, but it's in America and you said there was no problems at all with race?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: At Vassar?
Speaker 2: I didn't see any.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But you didn't go into town much 'cause there wasn't much of a town.  There wouldn't be much reason to go--you know there was a little place called the Dutch Cabin [Dutch Cabin Restaurant, Poughkeepsie, New York] where you'd go eat and there wasn't any problem there, but there wasn't any town to speak of much.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's not even any curiosity about difference or anything and you know with just so few black students I mean or African American students?
Speaker 2: I think it didn't cross their minds most of them 'cause there were so few.
Speaker 1: Okay, so on campus there were no problems in the--?
Speaker 2: No problem.
Speaker 1: No issues, no grievances or any--okay.  Did most of the students think that you were white too or what?
Speaker 2: Oh no that word gets around very quickly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, that gets around quickly, it's interesting.
Speaker 1: Okay, well it was never any issue or anything about--
Speaker 2: No, I didn't have any issues there.
Story_ID: 589209
Speaker 1: Now when you--let's see, before you graduated there was Brown v. the Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954], was that talked about on campus at all?  Were there any discussions about that?
Speaker 2: Well I don't think they saw it as a problem so it wasn't such an im- I mean people talked about it because it was such a big issue, but--what year was that?
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty-four [1954].
Speaker 2: Fifty-four [1954] yeah, I don't think that was--by '54 [1954] there were a lot more black people in the classes behind me than there were in mine--my class.  No, I think that was--but most of the girls from Vassar [Vassar College, Poughkeepsie, New York] came from northern communities, there weren't many southerners there.
Speaker 1: Okay, well North was (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The North wasn't paradise; I mean you could be segregated in New York City [New York, New York], I mean you know.
Speaker 2: Well it was.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Josephine Baker couldn't stay at the St. Regis Hotel [The St. Regis New York, New York, New York] when she here from France 'cause she was black I mean you know it's, this is still America so.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That's why I'm just baffled.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That there's nothing.  You had no conflicts whatsoever or no issues at all?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't have any issues there but I don't think the college would've allowed it you know.  We had dorm mothers everywhere and I think if they sensed something was going on they would've gotten right on top of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean they had discussions and there were multicultural groups you know but I don't think it was an issue per se.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Course one girl did tell me that she didn't think her family would be happy when they realized--we had a tower suite and so there were ten of us and she said, "I was trying to debate whether I was gonna tell my mother you were black or not," and she said then I said, was, you know and she said but it was not a problem, she was very pleased, when she thought her mother might be prejudiced.
Speaker 1: Now did the African American girls have African American roommates?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay so it didn't, maybe it didn't even--they didn't even do that, okay.
Speaker 2: You could have whoever, you know, whoever you wanted.
Story_ID: 589210
Speaker 1: How did they deal with race in your sociology classes [at Vassar College, Poughkeepsie, New York]? Did they talk about it--
Speaker 2: Oh, they just talked about it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in a realistic way or--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, a very realistic way.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know there was a lot during those days in talking about race and discrimination in terms of the--if you turned--of the sociology of it is that people always wanted to have somebody they feel you know they're superior to and it was always addressed in that way rather than in the--you know that you, you just wanted to keep someone down.  But I think in the South if you go back to the history of discrimination I mean that had to do with an economy that they didn't want to give up.  You know it was a very cheap source of labor, as well as you know the discrimination part about that feeling about race.
Story_ID: 589211
Speaker 1: Are there any stories about anything that happened at Vassar [Vassar College, Poughkeepsie, New York] that would make a good story or (laughter) an anecdote or anything?
Speaker 2: I think they were very careful about that.
Speaker 1: No, about anything.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know anything that had happened to you along the way that well would make a good story.
Speaker 2: I don't remember any; I had a good time at Vassar.  I made lifelong friends you know we're still friends.  I didn't have any incidents then.
Speaker 1: Do you think--is there anything there that you learned?
Speaker 2: There was one time I remember that--and we were going somewhere off campus and somebody had, had a problem at one of those ethnic restaurants, and I can't--I think it was a Polish restaurant and someone said, "Well maybe we ought not go there," and I said, "What happened?"  Well somebody had some kind of incident but there were literally no blacks in Poughkeepsie [New York] to speak of so it was never you know--I'm, I'm not sure there were four blacks in the whole town, I'm not sure.  I don't think many more than that. Okay, is there anything that you learned by going to Northfield [Northfield School for Girls; Northfield Mount Hermon School, Gill, Massachusetts] or Vassar [Vassar College, Poughkeepsie, New York] that you think you wouldn't have learned at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama]?  I mean in terms of the world, outside world?
Speaker 1: Well yeah you know that there, you know that some people you know--in, in Tuskegee you're in sort of a cocoon where you're the majority and even though there was a white population there you didn't--I mean you had, you had the better life in that, in that sense than they had 'cause you had more advantages with a you know a college community than they would have there.  So I don't think you thought of them as having a better life than you had.  I think it's when you went outside of that you did.  Like you would go to Rich's store which was a big store in Atlanta [Georgia] and you couldn't go in the restaurant to eat.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Rich's Department Store, right.
Speaker 1: Remember that?  'Cause after we left that, that changed.
Speaker 2: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV): There was no place you could go, other than Paschal's [Paschal's Restaurant].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV):  (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Clarice [HistoryMaker Clarice Dibble Walker, IV] just said off camera, "No, place you could go other than Paschal's [Paschal's Restaurant] in Atlanta to eat."  So is there anything that you learned about the outside world, outside of the South and outside of Tuskegee that at Northfield and Vassar that you can put your finger on?
Speaker 1: Well, I think at Northfield it was so protected you know that very little would happen.  At Northfield--at Vassar you sort of knew those girls who were not interested in you because you were of the race, but it didn't matter 'cause you probably weren't interested in them either (laughter).  So it, it didn't matter from that perspective.  I think that it--when you grow up in Tuskegee you grow up with a certain security about yourself that you take to the bigger world and so if someone you know is gonna be prejudiced against you, that's their problem not yours because it's not gonna impact you especially now.
Story_ID: 589212
Speaker 1: Well did you have any favorite teachers at Vassar [Vassar College, Poughkeepsie, New York]?  I didn't ask you that question.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did, I did you know depending on what--it was a woman who was a very good professor in economics and was very--and spent a lot of time with students so everyone sort of liked her, but if you're in a small school you know everybody, everybody knows you and it has its advantages.
Speaker 1: Okay who was--there's so many notable people that came out of Vassar.  Was there anybody there that we would know today I mean whose name we know?
Speaker 2: I don't know who that would be.  I'd have to think about it you know who's famous now.
Speaker 1: Yeah I think like Jackie Kennedy [Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis] went there at one point. I don't know who was there when you were there, but a lot of different.
Speaker 2: I don't know who that would be.  A lot of people have done very well.
Story_ID: 589213
Speaker 1: So, well when you were on the verge of graduation you know you had planned to go to graduate school, you said right?  And did you know where you were going, I mean you--I guess you had it worked out that you were going to the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] right?  Why did you choose the University of Chicago and?
Speaker 2: You knew all the graduate schools recruit and that's how I ended up choosing the University of Chicago, also I had a lot of friends and family there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I absolutely, I absolutely love Chicago [Illinois] as a city. I think it's a great city.
Speaker 1: So you went to the University of Chicago's--the graduate school of?
Speaker 2: Social work, SSA [University of Chicago School of Social Service Administration, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: SSA in 1955?
Speaker 2: Five [1955].
Speaker 1: So, well.
Speaker 2: And then I lived there 'til I got married twenty-eight years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you finish school first before you got married?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Oh, what was that?  Now does--SSA is a famous school at the University of Chicago and they have a long tradition and all that.  Who were some of your teachers and fellow students?
Speaker 2: Well I had a lot of really good teachers--Bacon [ph.], a woman named Alfert [ph.] who was great in some of the economic issues with social concerns and but the thing about the University of Chicago you had access to all the graduate schools you could sit in almost any course.  So if you wanted to hear a famous faculty member you'd go sit for one lecture or two lectures.  I think you could only sit for two, yeah.  Well his son, do you know Allison [HistoryMaker Allison Davis] and Gordon Davis [HistoryMaker Gordon J. Davis]?  Their father was a professor, a very, very esteemed professor at the University of Chicago, Allison Davis [W. Allison Davis].
Speaker 1: He was in the department, the SSA department?
Speaker 2: No, no he was in the Department of Sociology.
Speaker 1: Sociology, okay all right.  Was he the only black professor there?
Speaker 2: No, there were, you--there were several there, not of his rank.
Speaker 1: Okay, now Allison Davis from what I remember, you wouldn't know if he was black if you.
Speaker 2: Oh, no you'd know he--
Speaker 1: If you just looked at him.
Speaker 2: No, you would know he was black. You wouldn't know if his wife [Elizabeth Stubbs Davis] was black.
Speaker 1: Okay, oh, okay.
Speaker 2: You're thinking of young Allison.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay all right.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: The older Allison Davis you could--he was the obviously.
Speaker 2: He was brown skinned.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and it was his son who was hard to tell.
Speaker 2: Allison you can't tell, but Gordon you could tell he's black.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: But see his dad and mother came from a quite an esteemed family in Wilmington, north Delaware.  It was Stubbs, remember them?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But didn't she go to--she went to--his mother went to Radcliffe [Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Okay so what was graduate school exciting or just an exercise or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was fun.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was.
Speaker 1: And what new ground was being broken at the University of Chicago in those days in terms of sociology?
Speaker 2: Well, actually what they were trying to do was to bring discipline to this area of social interrelationships and what makes some people failures and what makes some people successes and what the, you know what the world provides, what it does not provide and this equation in terms of you know why do we have people who can go through school very successfully and people who can't, even though they have the IQ to.  So I think from that you know that there are all kinds of clauses to--that cause these great systemic problems in the community, the breakdown of it.  Actually, I'm not sure that Chicago was as good in that as some of the New York [New York] schools and community organization.  The graduate schools in New York probably were better at that than they were in Chicago.  Well a lot of the original work was done there.
Story_ID: 589214
Speaker 1: Did you do field work in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay where did you do field work?
Speaker 2: I did field work at the University of Chicago Hospitals [University of Chicago Clinics and Hospitals; University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago, Illinois] and I did field work at a local agency there, homeless teenagers.
Speaker 1: Okay do you remember the name of it?
Speaker 2: I'm gonna think of it in a minute--the Briar School [ph.] I think it is.  It's call now--it's changed names, it was the Briar School when I was there.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry what?
Speaker 2: Briar.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's changed names since then.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: You know a lot of these agencies have joined together now and so they aren't independent.
Story_ID: 589215
Speaker 1: So now this has gotta be probably I guess the first time when you were in a large--near a large black community, the South Side of Chicago [Illinois], Woodlawn community I guess?
Speaker 2: Right, yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, I lived in an all-black community growing up, Tuskegee [Alabama].
Speaker 2: Yeah, it wasn't urban.
Speaker 1: No, not urban.
Speaker 2: Like Chicago, so this is like a, as a--what were your impressions of black Chicago when you arrived?
Speaker 1: I loved it I thought it was a lot of fun.  When I moved to Washington [D.C.], I said, "Where do people go here" (laughter). I had no place to go (laughter).  You know you go to restaurants and things there, you go to Chicago you go out to dinner and then you, there are a lot of places, fun places you could go hear good music and it was a--it's a good town.  It's got that great university [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] right there in the middle of the--heart of the South Side and it--I thought my living was less expensive than here.  I think Washington's more expensive than Chicago.  I had a great apartment.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you were in Hyde Park?
Speaker 1: Yeah and Kenwood.
Story_ID: 589216
Speaker 1: You finished graduate school in '61 [1961] is that it or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, '61 [1961]; I went back.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you (unclear).
Speaker 2: I dropped out and I got married and I went back and finished.
Speaker 1: Okay all right and you married [HistoryMaker] Mercer Cook, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And he's from a kind of a famous family too?
Speaker 2: Yeah Will Mercer.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Will Marion Cook was his grandfather and Mercer Cook [Will Mercer Cook], the trans- the French translator.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And scholar, and his father.  So and now how did you meet?
Speaker 2: He was at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] when I was there.
Speaker 1: Okay and so you got married, you had like how many children?
Speaker 2: Four.
Speaker 1: Oh okay, so you were pretty busy I guess being a mother I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: In Chicago [Illinois], so that delayed your graduation from?
Speaker 2: But I went back.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you went back and finished in '61 [1961].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 589217
Speaker 1: So what did you do after you finished your degree?
Speaker 2: I worked at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay now that's pretty convenient (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah it was very convenient 'cause I lived right nearby.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.  So what did you do?
Speaker 2: I was in the social work department [Department of Social Service] at the hospital there [University of Chicago Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: It's a medical center.
Speaker 1: So this--you were doing what you were trained to do, and so you weren't out of you know--okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, just tell us about the kind of work you do, what does it constitute?
Speaker 2: Well it was a process--working at the University of Chicago hospitals that actually to do with either helping people manage their lives so that they can take care of their medical problems you know, making sure that they had--if they did not have insurance that--making sure that they could apply for assistance to get care and then dealing with the issues of the emotional and mental problems dealing with illness.
Speaker 1: Okay, so was it primarily like a counseling (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Counseling, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay all right.
Speaker 2: And if they were planning to do some really difficult kind of surgery they would ask you to go in and talk to patients and families about what was gonna happen and how they were gonna be able to manage their lives.
Story_ID: 589218
Speaker 1: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV): We also dealt a fair amount with child abuse.
Speaker 2: Yeah we did, we dealt a lot with child abuse.
Speaker 1: Okay was that, do you think it was more prevalent then than it is today?
Speaker 2: Well then it was just being recognized you know as abuse, and what was interesting was that it comes from all stratas of society, I mean usually when it happens with people with lower incomes it's usually the pressures of living that makes it very difficult you know for them to take on rearing a child.  Usually when it's with people with--you know middle class and upper middle class it has to do more with psychiatric issues than everyday living.
Speaker 1: These are the days when there was corporal punishment in the public schools, right?  When you could paddle a kid in the public school and.
Speaker 2: Well yeah.
Speaker 1: And in the '50s [1950s] and '60s [1960s] yeah.  So I don't know when.
Speaker 2: But they were beginning to get away from that.
Speaker 1: Right, it was--but it was still.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you could hit kids actually you know in the school system and it was not unusual for people to do it at home, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, no not at home, there were a lot of times there was parent abuse.
Speaker 1: Right, so how did you--in those days how did you?
Speaker 2: Well we had to refer 'em to the court right away.
Speaker 1: Okay, and how would you draw the law in terms of regular corporal punishment and child abuse?
Speaker 2: When it went to excess, you know the kid was hurt--basically.
Speaker 1: Or had to be hospitalized or something?
Speaker 2: No, they could be brought in by a neighbor or somebody to the emergency room just for treating, you know treatment.  We'd get a lot of--we use to get a lot of complaints from neighbors.
Speaker 1: Okay, so was the University of Chicago [University of Chicago Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois] significant in the--in campaigning to end corporal punishment in the public schools and or to?
Speaker 2: No, they weren't probably significant in it but there was a huge community effort in this direction now.
Speaker 1: Were there any organizations you know (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, there were a lot of organizations.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That were dealing with abuse.
Speaker 1: Were you a part of those organizations?
Speaker 2: The graduate school of social work [University of Chicago School of Social Service Administration, Chicago, Illinois] had a special unit actually on that, they've had money to do research.
Story_ID: 589219
Speaker 1: It says that from 1970 to '87 [1987] you worked as a field work associate professor at the School of Social Service Administration [University of Chicago School of Social Service Administration, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: How did that come about?
Speaker 2: Pardon?  I did that in conjunction with my job.  We had field work students that were placed in our offices.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you teach?  You taught, you were teaching (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, I was their advisor there, teaching there.  That we--they had--part of their course work was a practicum and they were placed in our offices at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], and I was--yeah I was involved in that.
Speaker 1: Okay so they would report to you as?
Speaker 2: Well we were, yeah, we were responsible for supervising their training, practical training.
Speaker 1: Okay you did that for long time.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Um, then you came and--the director of social services at Chicago Lying-in Hospital at the University of Chicago Medical Center [Chicago, Illinois].  Now what is the Chicago Lying-in Hospital?
Speaker 2: That's the obstetrical hospital.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Women's diseases and obstetrics.
Speaker 1: Okay so you provided social services for women--okay.  And yeah in the maternity ward there basically?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But we had a big hospital for that.
Speaker 1: Okay so you were--you did that from--is it correct that you did that from 1970 to '85 [1985], is that?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm sorry I didn't get the--I should've asked.  What year did you get married?
Speaker 2: To Vernon [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.]?
Speaker 1: No, to [HistoryMaker] Mercer Cook before, I didn't ask that question.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: I--you know.
Speaker 2: Fifty-six [1956].
Speaker 1: Oh, fity-six [1956]. Okay.
Story_ID: 589220
Speaker 1: This is a long work history.  What is the--what are the most significant aspects of this work that when you reflect back on it you know.
Speaker 2: Well you know the, the part that was so great about it was the part being involved with the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] which is interesting 'cause you were always involved in some little research project or something new they were work on.  The--also the great advantage of it was the community that I lived in, and you know when you're working with four kids--I worked nine blocks from my house--my office was nine blocks from my house.  The school was ten blocks from my house (laughter), which is very convenient.  In addition to that I was surrounded by family, literally within a two block area my cousin, one cousin, another cousin lived two doors from me and an aunt lived two doors from me and my brother lived around the corner.  And so there was never a problem about babysitting you know, if my housekeeper couldn't come there was always someone there.  If your car wasn't working there was somebody else's car you could get in a minute and I mean it was--made it very easy to work when they had that many support systems around you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Plus it was a great city to live in.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've heard a lot about the Kenwood community.
Speaker 2: That's where it was.
Speaker 1: And how tight it was you know.
Speaker 2: Hyde Park, Kenwood [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: So that is, that's the community that our current president, Barack Obama's [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama], house is situated in.
Speaker 2: Yes it's around the corner from where I lived.
Story_ID: 589221
Speaker 1: It's a great story, I mean if you're working you know there's some kid who's sick all the time, there's somebody who's whatever and to have an aunt, I mean if your housekeeper didn't show up, but I was very fortunate I had the same housekeeper for a long time, but my aunt was you know two doors down and she was always home.  If you needed to take the kids to a doctor, she would take 'em in a minute and it's a certain comfort level with that, with knowing that you can go to work and if there's a problem you can solve it, and having that much family around made it possible to do that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Plus we had dinners every weekend.  There was a big family dinner.  Somebody was cooking or we'd join dinners (laughter) or--it made it quite easy.  I mean it could've been very difficult and if had a kid sick I could send them right down to my aunt's house if my housekeeper wasn't there.  So it was very, very nice.
Story_ID: 589222
Speaker 1: Were you involved in any of the social change activities in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, when, when Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] came to the community it really made a big change and everybody went to those.  Everybody was involved with it.
Speaker 1: This would be about 1968 I guess or so?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: About 1968 or so?
Speaker 2: I think it was before that, wasn't it?
Speaker 1: Well I don't know.  I think he came to Chicago [Illinois] before Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated and (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And he had that--use to have these meeting every Saturday morning.
Speaker 1: Operation PUSH [Rainbow PUSH Coalition, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Operation PUSH.
Speaker 2: Operation PUSH.
Speaker 1: Breadbasket, Operation Breadbasket, right?
Speaker 2: It was great, it was and, and really did organize the community to begin to talk about or even to--and begin to approach the issue of the segregation that still existed in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Now let--I think there was activity going on before that I know with Al Raby [Albert Raby] and Berry [Edwin C. Berry] and--.
Speaker 2: But that was more about the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], but Berry was with the Urban League [Chicago Urban League].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And he, he was very good about that, I mean they really--Chicago was a very segregated city a long time.
Speaker 1: Right, there's a housing crisis that Lorraine Hansberry talks about in her play 'Raisin in the Sun' ['A Raisin in the Sun'].  Did you, I mean do you--I guess and some of the Hyde Parkers were involved in a lot of that, you know the housing struggle.  Is there, was a there a housing struggle in Hyde Park in terms of African Americans acquiring housing?
Speaker 2: It used to be, be--it was a little before my time I think but when Allison Davis [W. Allison Davis] was a full professor and he couldn't buy in a lot of apartments there, but he--they did break that and you know that changed.  Chicago is a very segregated city and you know blacks wouldn't go on the Near West Side [Chicago, Illinois]. West Side they didn't, just didn't go over there, and I think all of that has changed now.  I think the city's moved--you know has expanded way beyond where it was when I was there.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you--your family follow the Civil Rights Movement and on television and you know through the media?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, everyone was involved.  I mean Jesse really called attention to it in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Now before Jesse though did you--can you remember where you were when Dr. King was assassinated?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Dr. King was very big, but I mean everybody had great, great admiration for him, but I'm talking about on the ground kind of--Jesse was very involved in that in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay, I just wondered if there is a story about where you were when Dr. King was assassinated or if you had a chance to meet Dr. King when he came to town in '66 [1966]?  He actually lived in Chicago.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I met Dr. King and, and my family was friends with Dr. King down in Tuskegee [Alabama] when he was in Montgomery [Alabama], but he didn't spend a lot of time in Chicago, and if anyone I think people would associate a lot of the change with Jesse.
Speaker 1: Okay so, well tell us.
Speaker 2: But I mean the city had moved to that point you know when Jesse came in, there were people who were really concerned about it and they were actually, I mean Daley [Richard J. Daley] was tough.
Story_ID: 589223
Speaker 1: What are your reflections on the, on Mayor Richard J. Daley I guess?
Speaker 2: You mean the senior?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well he was--I mean he, he was pushed to even begin to think about this.  I mean he would've been very I think satisfied with Chicago's [Chicago, Illinois] staying the same, but you know there were places in Chicago that blacks didn't go.  You know the Near West Side was mainly, I think mainly Polish at that point and people were careful about where they went, but fortunately the South Side was a very vibrant part of the community because of the university [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] there.  So it made a big difference.
Story_ID: 589224
Speaker 1: Tell us your memories of--well Operation Breadbasket [Rainbow PUSH Coalition, Chicago, Illinois], Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] starts emerging into the national spotlight.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Late 1968, 1969 after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and you know as you were saying the weekly meetings at Operation PUSH which was right on--I guess it's really in Hyde Park right there on Drexel [Boulevard].
Speaker 2: Yeah, it' right out.
Speaker 1: On 50th [Street] and Drexel.
Speaker 2: Now it is.
Speaker 1: Where did he start?
Speaker 2: It was--before that, it was somewhere on 47th Street, he moved to 50th and Drexel.  He was a very influential part I think in moving issues faster maybe.  I think they were moving at the time that you know he gained all of his importance there, but he really worked hard on that, and I mean he brought together, and there were tons of people at those Saturday meetings every week.
Speaker 1: And so did you go a lot to?
Speaker 2: I use to go a lot but I--then I sort of got away from it.  When you have kids it's hard to be out Saturday morning.
Speaker 1: So what were some of the issues that concerned you the most that he was raising?
Speaker 2: Well the fact of the prejudice and the inequities in the school system were terrible.  You know Chicago [Illinois] had all those run down schools (laughter) in the black community.
Speaker 1: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV):  And marches.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV):  Against the superintendent.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh they did, they had to turn that whole thing around, but Jesse was very instrumental in that.  There's just no question about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was. I mean he's who brought it all together.  There were groups that were formed and then blossomed because of him but he was, he was the catalyst that moved it a lot.
Speaker 1: Okay so you're saying that he kind of--the issues that Al Raby [Albert Raby] and Bill Berry [Edwin C. Berry] and others who were raised, raised before Jesse Jackson kind of?
Speaker 2: Well they did a lot of work, I mean there's no question that Bill Berry was very involved in it and really fought for things and all, but in the mass way it was when Jesse did it.

Speaker 1: Okay, now did you know Harold Washington before he ran [for mayor of Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: For office?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, what were your impressions of him?
Speaker 2: Well he was a--he was a terrific person actually.  He just had a big plateful and you know those Chicago [Illinois] politicians and that Democratic Party (laughter), they were tough.  They weren't giving an inch you know, he had a tough time.
Speaker 1: 'Cause he lived right there in Hyde Park too, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah he did live out in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Did you play any role in his campaign?
Speaker 2: No, I just worked in his campaign.  I really didn't have a big role.   I had four kids then (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did you help raise some money for him or anything?
Speaker 2: Yeah, everybody was trying to raise money for that and you know every Saturday they would raise money, but everybody got into that finally.
Speaker 1: Did you think that he had a chance to win?  I mean and when did you think that?
Speaker 2: Harold Washington?  You know it was interesting I thought he had a chance to win because for the first time we saw the North Side liberals begin to take an interest in what was happening and once that happened I think you know they had, they had enough of--they had enough support, both financial and otherwise to run a great campaign and they did.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what, what you're saying on a level too is that he couldn't of won with just the black vote?
Speaker 2: No he needed that, he needed the white support too, the reality of it you know.  What he was collecting it--you know you, you couldn't run a big campaign on that.  I mean so we--they had to have that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so.
Speaker 2: When so many blacks weren't registered to vote, that was the problem.
Speaker 1: And how was that solved?
Speaker 2: Well we got--spent a lot of time getting people out to vote, I mean to register them to vote.  That was a big issue and what we found out was if you look at the, you know the records of registered voters, how many really educated people weren't registered to vote (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was surprising, but he did a great job of getting people out to vote, there's no question about it.

Speaker 1: You were married until--to [HistoryMaker] Mercer Cook until when?

Story_ID: 589227
Speaker 1: I think in '81 [1981] this is about the time of the--when the--you know Harold Washington started talking about running.  You served as a director of Johnson and Johnson [Johnson and Johnson Products; Johnson and Johnson Services, Inc.]?  Is this like a board position for Johnson and Johnson?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, anything significant about that that you want to share with us?
Speaker 2: That was a great experience so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was that just after the time, just after I got on the board that they had the Tylenol (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, well tell us about that, the Tylenol scare?
Speaker 2: Well (laughter) they you know they didn't understand what had happened, you know they didn't know what had happened to it, and they got this call and I actually got a call in the middle of the night and they had just called I guess Jim Burke [James E. Burke] about it, and they withdrew it.  It was the great decision that he made which has now become an example for others in crisis and that is he pulled everything off the market overnight, all the Tylenol.
Speaker 1: Just for those who don't know anything about this in the future they're gonna be looking at it, somebody as I recall they poisoned a bottle of Tylenol was it?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: They, they substituted the pills with some poison.
Speaker 2: Someone died.
Speaker 1: Yeah someone actually died and.
Speaker 2: And he pulled everything off the shelf and there was this big argument about you know, "Why, why you don't just pull 'em off at--in this area?"  He said, "No, I'm not gonna take a chance," and he said--pulled it off and there was some huge, I can't remember the, the number, some--like a billion dollar drug and he just pulled it.  He said, "I'm not taking a chance," and that was.
Speaker 1: So he pulled all of the bottles of Tylenol off the shelves, okay.
Speaker 2: All the bottles of Tylenol.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Off.
Speaker 1: Now I think that case started the companies put--placing seals over the tops.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Of the pill bottles and said, "If the seal has been broken you can buy, it if has you should not buy it."  Yeah, this was in 1980 something, right, I can't?
Speaker 2: Eighty-five [1985] or '86 [1986], I can't remember when it would have been.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: Became the great case study then at business schools.
Speaker 1: Okay and his name--the man's name was--is he a director at Johnson and Johnson?
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: The person you said (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Jim Burke was chairman of the board.
Speaker 1: Jim Burke, okay now anything else from the Johnson and Johnson days, I mean?
Speaker 2: No, it was a great learning experience of a company well run.
Speaker 1: Okay, you were a member of a Compensation and Benefits Committee and chairman of the Public Policy Advisory Committee, so did you have any decisions that you participated in that you know that had anything that affected that?
Speaker 2: Well you know in the drug industry there're always big decisions about you know how long are you gonna keep a drug on testing it you know.  How, how far out do you have to be before and interesting issues to discuss all the time there and they spent a lot of time discussing those.  The other issue is in integrating a big company you know in terms of the staff was another they were trying to deal with at that time.
Story_ID: 589228
Speaker 1: In 1986 you married Vernon Jordan [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.].

Speaker 2: (CLARICE DIBBLE WALKER, IV):  Really.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He's amazing; he's really an amazing person.  You know he speaks so, he only speaks what twenty minutes his sermons are only twenty minutes, but you always come out remembering some line that he said, he's amazing, he's really quite something with it.
Speaker 1: Is that--are you good friends with Gardner Taylor?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Vernon talks to him I think every day.
Speaker 1: Okay, so eventually you moved to D.C. in guess in--when did you move here?
Speaker 2: I got married in '86 [1986] and I think I moved when in '87 [1987].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Or '88 [1988].
Speaker 1: Just before you left you were director of the Department of Social Services for the University of Chicago Medical Center [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay so that--did it, were you kind of torn I mean in terms of moving here after you know achieving that directorship or?
Speaker 2: Well you know I liked Chicago (laughter); it is hard to give up a career that you've had a great time with and living there was terrific, but I did move (laughter).  I commuted for a little while.
Speaker 1: Okay so what did you do when you came here?
Speaker 2: I haven't done anything really to speak of.

Story_ID: 589230
Speaker 1: You were very much involved in Bill Clinton's [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] campaign.  Bill Clinton is a very close friend of your husband Vernon Jordan [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.], and a lot of people know that from the media and so forth.  Tell us now how did you get--well I, it's obvious that you were gonna be involved on some level because of your husband.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But what attracted you to Bill Clinton's?
Speaker 2: Campaign?
Speaker 1: Yes?
Speaker 2: I wanted him to win so I went to work there, as a volunteer.
Speaker 1: Okay, and I've--we have here that you, there's a big fundraiser that you hosted in '94 [1994]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had a big fundraiser for him, but I, I just worked in the office you know doing whatever they told me to do.  I was a worker bee.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you weren't telling them, they were telling you?
Speaker 2: No, they were telling me what to do.
Speaker 1: And--okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't have any position of (laughter)--I was just doing what I was told to do.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you enjoyed it there?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And Bill Clinton has been a guest in your home many times?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And well what is it about him, now here's the president of the United States, former president?
Speaker 2: Well he and Vernon were very close friends and you know the wonderful thing about Mr. Clinton is that he can--he--whoever he's talking to it's like the only person on the earth.  He's very interested and he can repeat his conversation.  And he said you know so and so told me the most interesting thing.  He can always find something interesting about what somebody else has said and remembers it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now I've heard that before, I'm, I guess about fifty times now.
Speaker 2: Well, it's true, I mean it is, it is the most amazing--he can talk to anybody and there's something he finds out about that person that he finds so interesting that he remembers (laughter) it.
Speaker 1: Yeah it's quite a gift I guess.
Speaker 2: It is quite a gift.
Speaker 1: And, now your husband served as sort of an advisor to President Clinton when the Lewinsky scandal went down in--was it '98 [1998] I guess?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know what you think, what did you think about that whole thing at the time?
Speaker 2: About what?
Speaker 1: The Monica Lewinsky scandal?
Speaker 2: Whatever, I mean, I don't have any (laughter).
Speaker 1: Anything to say?
Speaker 2: Anything to say about that.
Speaker 1: Okay, what about Mrs. Clinton [Hillary Rodham Clinton]?
Speaker 2: Yes, she's terrific.  She's a very talented person and she's doing a great job as secretary of state.
Story_ID: 589231
Speaker 1: Now were you torn during the recent election as to who to support between Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] and Mrs. Clinton [Hillary Rodham Clinton]?
Speaker 2: Well, you know you don't--if you have your friends (laughter), you don't cop out on 'em, but I think he's done terrifically and I think he's gonna be a very successful president.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We had a fundraiser for him when he just started running.  I think he's terrific.
Speaker 1: Okay, now where do you think, I guess as a, somebody who worked as a professional in the field of sociology for such a long time, I mean where do you think that this--things are heading now in terms of services provided to people in hospitals and?
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: You know.
Speaker 2: The new legislation?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well you know.
Speaker 1: The healthcare reform [Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010] and all that you know?
Speaker 2: Healthcare is very difficult now because it's, it's so complicated and from where it used to be.  I mean it used to be simple if you had a healthcare policy, it covered and that's, that doesn't happen anymore.  I mean they're--it's gotten so expensive and so complicated that you, if you don't know your policy really well and have extra money, I mean it's difficult.  The healthcare bill as such I think is very--I mean I think what--the one they passed is good for some things.  I don't know how it will change the whole healthcare system 'cause I haven't read it so, I mean this is from what I've read in the newspaper.  So I don't know but I think it is very important to have this legislation go through.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think this is a great success.
Story_ID: 589232
Speaker 1: We were talking about the importance of the new healthcare initiative [Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010] that was passed by [U.S.] Congress recently, and so you think they're on the right track with the new legislation?
Speaker 2: Well I don't know I haven't read the whole you know, I just know what I read in the newspaper, so I don't really know, but I do think they had to pass something.  I think it's a beginning probably.
Speaker 1: Okay, now do you have anything that you would like to see happen politically and help them with the situation in terms of the--I guess the social conditions and the social problems we have today?
Speaker 2: Right now?
Speaker 1: Yeah, do you have any specific ideas about that?
Speaker 2: Well, I think one of the great issues in this country and one that this country has always been very good about is education, and I worry now you know when you hear--read about some of the problems that we have and providing good education, that this a very, this is a great threat to this country because education is so important, I mean the econo- I mean the way we live in this economy is so complicated now that they're probably very few jobs that are unskilled in this country.  I, I don't know how you maintain the workforce if you don't maintain the standards of education.
Speaker 1: Okay, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community in specific these days?
Speaker 2: Well your hopes are that they have not only have the same opportunities but they have the ability to take, take you know to make use of them, and I think that sometimes we think that this problem is solved and it isn't solved, you know that there's still some major differences in this, in our society and that we have to be ever vigilant to make--we sure--make sure that we continue our great interest in solving them, education being one.
Speaker 1: What do you think the major education problems are?
Speaker 2: Well, one are our schools you know, there've been recent articles now about the effectiveness of our public schools and that's always been the backbone of our society and I think we need to be vigilant and concerned about it.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have any specific ideas to improve the public schools?
Speaker 2: No I don't have any specific ideas but I tell you if you get more of the main community involved in it, they get solved.
Speaker 1: Okay, so community involvement is key?
Speaker 2: I think it's an important part.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think the community has to be aware of it and that community has to take an active part in solving it.
Story_ID: 589233
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything that you've done thus far, is there any major move that you would make differently, if you could?
Speaker 2: You know what it's--when you look back the one thing I think about it is you know if you have been healthy, if you've not been sick, you, it's--you are so fortunate you know in this world if you think about all the problems that you can have that keep you from performing, and so if you've main- if you've been able to maintain good health, it makes a big difference.  And I was thinking about you know sometimes our healthcare system has gotten so complicated to get healthcare that, I, I that does concern me.  I mean I think we're doing the best that we can given the circumstances, but I, I think that would be a concern of mine.
Speaker 1: Okay, is there anything?
Speaker 2: Education would be the other.
Speaker 1: Well is there anything that you would do different with your life if you could do it again.
Speaker 2: Well, probably a lot of things, but I can't complain about my life.  I would be ungrateful if I did.
Speaker 1: Okay, likewise when you look back on everything you've done to this point what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Um, I hadn't thought about that (laughter).  I don't know what I'd consider to be my legacy.  I think your legacy lives with your children and the quality of their lives and how they live it.
Story_ID: 589234
Speaker 1: Well speaking of your children and family, tell us about you know, reflect on your family and your family life today, and what it means to you?
Speaker 2: On my family?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well it means everything, it's very much a part of my life, and it's fortunate that we all sort of live close by and so we're very involved with each other and that makes a big difference.  There's a lot in the security of the family.  You know I think about if I had a real problem, I have a number of people in my family I could go to for help and that makes a lot of difference.  That's a great security in itself.
Speaker 1: Okay now you have children and do you wanna say anything about your husband [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.] and the children before we--I ask my last question (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm very fortunate (laughter) that I have, we have four wonderful children who are healthy and well educated and doing well at this point.  You always keep your fingers crossed when you say that and a wonderful husband who's healthy and we're still--he's still working and so he's having a good time with his life so that's important.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did your parents [Helen Taylor Dibble and Eugene H. Dibble, Jr.] get a chance to see you become successful?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think--no, my parents died quite a while ago, but I think they knew that we were all all right, I mean that we were educated and we were able to take care of ourselves and happy and I think they were.
Speaker 1: Okay, now is there anything?
Speaker 2: We have the advantage of having a very close family.  It's big and close and that makes a big difference.
