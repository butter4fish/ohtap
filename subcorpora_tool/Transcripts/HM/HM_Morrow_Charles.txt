Speaker 1: Can you give us the names of your parents and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's name was Charles Gay Morrow, II, of course.  C-H-A-R-L-E-S, Gay, G-A-Y, Morrow M-O-R-R-O-W.  My mother's name, maiden name, Lillian Suzann Reescher, L-I-L-L-I-A-N, Lillian, Suzann was S-U-Z-A-N-N, and Reescher, R-E-E-S-C-H-E-R.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How many siblings in your family and the birth order?
Speaker 2: I have one sister who's two years younger than me, Kathy Lynn Morrow Carter now.
Story_ID: 11014
Speaker 1: Can we go from your early time to your school years into your adult and career years, so give me that.  Can you tell me what was it like growing up in the Morrow household?
Speaker 2: It was--my parents were involved in politics before I was born.  They were--they and their friends were about service.  My mother [Lillian Suzann Reescher Morrow] grew up in a very religious family, and I was taught at an early age that you have to give back.  And when you give back, things will take care of you.  One of the things my parents did allow myself and my sister [Kathy Lynn Morrow Carter] to do, they took us a lot of places and we were able to see a lot of things, and we were exposed to a lot of different things that a lot of African American kids weren't exposed to at that time.  And my parents had a wide range of friends.  They were my mother's friends or my father's [Charles Gay Morrow, II] friends were African American, Caucasian, Japanese American, so, I grew up in a big melting pot, around a big melting pot.  And we used to have a lot of fun.
Story_ID: 11015
Speaker 1: What is your earliest memory growing up of your parents as individuals, your mother first.
Speaker 2: Well, my mother [Lillian Suzann Reescher Morrow] is, was a very kind person, she died, she's been deceased now since 1994.  But she was a very compassionate person, kind of soft, quiet spoken, she was only about 5 [feet] 2 [inches], weighed about 100 pounds.  But she was strict.  She was a disciplinarian.  And I'll never forget her final words when she passed away, or just before she passed away.  She took a lot of pride in me becoming who I am, or as I am now, state representative.  But I'll always remember her last words to me were, she said, "You were a good son.  The best son that a mother could ever have."  So, that always sticks with me.
Speaker 1: Can you give me one of your most valued memories of your interchange with your mother?
Speaker 2: Just being with her.  She was fun to be around all the time.  Like I said, she brought out the compassionate side of me.  Whereas, my father [Charles Gay Morrow, II], I'm not--love my father.  He has been deceased for twenty-one years.  But he was kind of a rough going kind of person.  A lot of people, he was, he, as I learned in Institute from a religion teacher, he told me at that time, there are two type of people in this world, those who intimidate and those who are intimidated. My father was an intimidator. (Laughs)  And I have a lot of that in me, too.  As well as reflected in my political nickname, 'Pit Bull.'  But I'm glad that I'm able to balance that side with my mother's side, which is to show some compassion.
Speaker 1: Did your mother work outside the home?
Speaker 2: Yes, she worked for twenty-six years with the CHA, the Chicago Housing Authority.  She was president of the credit union for almost twenty years.
Story_ID: 11016
Speaker 1: And what kind of work did your father do?
Speaker 2: My father [Charles Gay Morrow, II] was a bus driver in the '50s [1950s].  He was a legislative assistant for former [Illinois State] Representative Raymond [W.] Ewell. So, that's where I got my political start.
Speaker 1: And you were saying your father worked for the CTA [Chicago Transit Authority] and then--.
Speaker 2: And then he worked for Representative Raymond Ewell and he was ill in his later years of life and he passed away at an early age-- well, early for a young--for--I consider, he passed away when he was forty-eight years old.
Speaker 1: Just what do you remember of hearing political discussions in your household?
Speaker 2: Well, as far as political discussions, my family and my parents and friends tended to congregate in the kitchen, of course, where the food and the drinks were easily to get to.  And they would argue and have conversations all hours of the day and night about politics.  Of course, during that time, that was in the 1960s when the Civil Rights Movement was very strong.  And they felt that being in their twenties and early thirties at that time, that they had something to give back.
Speaker 1: Do you remember being any way conscious of all that political energy in your household, and about how old were you then?
Speaker 2: Well, my first start, as far as getting involved in politics, began when I was six years old, when Representative Raymond Ewell at the time ran, made his first attempt to run as state representative in 1962.  He was not the Democratic [party]-slated candidate at the time, and so he did not win against the Democratic-slated candidate.  But I remember my first chore was to pass out literature.  Stand in front of Walgreens [pharmacy chain] on 75th [Street] and State [Street, Chicago, Illinois] and hand out literatures at six years old.
Story_ID: 11017
Speaker 1: And your school years, elementary school, what was that like?
Speaker 2: My grade school I went to, I went to Martha Ruggles Elementary School [Chicago, Illinois], which is located on 78th [Street] and Prairie [Avenue].  I attended there from kindergarten. Let me go back a little further, though, my first year or my first half-year in kindergarten, I attended Forrestville [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] down on 44th [Street] and Langley [Avenue].  At that time my parents and I were living on 44th [Street] and [Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] Drive. When we moved out to 45 West 78th Street, I was attending Martha Ruggles, which was a very disciplined school. There was a principal there, Mrs. Weisberg, was only about 4 [feet] 10 [inches], but when she walked down the hallway, you could hear a pin drop, and the teachers there were very dedicated to their work.  In fact, because my legislative district has Ruggles in my legislative district, I've very active with my schools in my district.  It feels good to see some of my teachers who taught me there, call me and I see them in the community and they're proud of what they were able to achieve with me.
Speaker 1: In the grades, fourth, fifth, sixth, what, at what point did you have your first school civics lesson?
Speaker 2: I would say probably fourth, fifth grade.  I was always in what they would call the honor classes at Ruggles.  Teachers like Mrs. Dennis and Mrs. Bogany and Mrs. Bohannon.  Mr. Ferguson was the gym teacher.  Back then PTAs [Parent Teacher Association] were more active and so they were very hard on us as far as working hard in school.
Speaker 1: And what was your thinking about the civics, the formal civics lesson in school when you started?
Speaker 2: Well, at the time, I've always liked history, but as far as civics, I was, I liked math.  In fact, when I went to college, I majored in mathematics.  And I'd also minored in history.  So I kind of combined, I had an interest in both of them.
Speaker 1: In high school, what is your favorite memory from high school?
Speaker 2: My high school memories as far as De La Salle [Institute, Chicago, Illinois], De La Salle probably prepared me more than any other time in my life as far as being able to survive in this world.  Most of the, well--just about every mayor of the city of Chicago in the last eighty years--except Mayor Jane Byrne and Mayor Harold Washington, are alumni of De La Salle.  The Dan Ryan Highway [sic, Expressway] is named after a De La Salle alumni.  One of the current [Illinois] Supreme Court members on the bench, Michael Bilandic, is a De La Salle alumni.  Our current mayor, Richard [ M.] Daley, is a De La Salle alumni.  The commissioner, or the Head Commissioner of the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners, Langdon D. Neal, who is an African American, is an alumnus of De La Salle.  So De La Salle  has kind of honed me as far as dealing with the different types of ethnic groups. As far as in an academic environment, most of the Caucasians at De La Salle were from Bridgeport [neighborhood in Chicago, Illinois], which at the time, Bridgeport was a very segregated community.  Some of the residents of Bridgeport had very closed minds.  Some of the African American students had closed minds, too.  And I think because of my parents having a wide variety of friends enabled me to go back and forth and focus on what the real purpose was, which is to get an education.  At De La Salle, you know,  it took a while for the various ethnic groups to mix, and sometimes there was some tensions, and sometimes it even came down to fistfights and things.  It was an all-boy school, so boys will be boys.  But by the time you got into your junior or senior year, you kind of realized that some of that stuff was foolish.
Speaker 1: And academically--.
Speaker 2: Academically, I was pretty much in honor rolls. I was a National Honor Society member.  I believe in my senior year, I finished eleventh in my class, so it's pretty much academics was very stressed.  Most of the teachers at De La Salle had at least twenty  years of service there, so they were very dedicated.  And being in, at an all-boys school, what was there to do but focus on academics?
Speaker 1: Your school years, high school years were from what year to what year?
Speaker 2: I was at De La Salle from 1970 to 1974.
Story_ID: 11018
Speaker 1: Would you share with us what you know, or what you felt or understood of your parents, life from your parents' perspective, when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, my parents were raised by, they were what, I won't say rich, but they weren't poor.  My father's [Charles Gay Morrow, II] parents, one was a, my grandfather was a supervisor for the post office.  Charles Morrow the first, and my grandmother, Ozella Morrow, was a supervisor for the phone company.  My parents, or my grandparents on my mother's side worked for the railroad and that's where I learned how to cook, because they were cooks, and of course, maintenance people on the railroad.  But on my mother's [Lillian Suzann Reescher Morrow] side, they could cook and that tradition was passed to my mother and they passed it on to me.
Speaker 1: And did you--were you aware of any challenges that your parents experienced being African Americans in day-to-day life?
Speaker 2: Well, they, they, they as all parents, I guess, stressed that they wanted something better for their children, as I would want something better for my children.  My father did not attend college.  When he graduated from high school--he went to Englewood [High School, Chicago, Illinois], he went directly into the [U.S.] Navy.  And to show what type of person my father was, he and his best friend, didn't, they enlisted and didn't tell their parents.  And so they didn't know where their sons were for almost two years.  My mother, she went to U of I [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Illinois] for a couple of years.  So, I was the first to graduate from college [Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, Illinois].  So, they just wanted to make sure that we achieved something that they weren't able to.
Story_ID: 11019
Speaker 1: We'll go back to your growing up years and if you can tell me my most challenging experience in my youth was.
Speaker 2: Well, now you're really getting personal about my most challenging experience, but a lot of people don't believe that when I was a child, I had a speech impediment.  I used to, in fact I still do, stutter.  I'm able to control it a lot better, but I was to a point that I knew the answers in school, I didn't want to be called on because of my fear of kids laughing at me.  And I really didn't get over that until I got out of college [Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: How did you accomplish that?
Speaker 2: I think as you get older, your confidence level begins to improve.  And your ability to handle things improves and then you just have a little bit more self-esteem about yourself as your ability to handle tasks.  One of the things my father [Charles Gay Morrow, II] told me before he died, because my father, like I said, had a harsh way about him.  I used to tell him--I asked him before he passed away, I said, "Dad, why were you so rough on me?"  And his response was, "'Cause I was raising a man."  And I said, he said, "Do you know what a man is?"  And I said, I gave him some answer I can't think of, I thought it was to define a man.  And he said, "A man is a person who can handle anything that confronts him."  And I was twenty-one years old, like I said, when he passed away, so I became the so-called patriarch of my family at a very early age.  And right now, I think a lot older than my peers because I've had things put on me at an early age.
Story_ID: 11020
Speaker 1: At the opposite pole is the most fun thing of the growing up years.  And I realize there has been a lot of fun and a lot of challenge, but one that most easily comes to mind.  What would you say that is?
Speaker 2: Well, my parents [Charles Gay Morrow, II and Lillian Suzann Reescher Morrow] and their friends, during the summertime, they used to take us to a resort called Union Pier, Michigan.  So, I spent a lot of my summers up there, learning how to swim, water skiing, driving boats.  So, that, that, that was a lot of fun.  My parents would always have little parties at the spur of the moment.  Because my parents and their friends were kind of middle- class, not kind, they were middle-class.  But at Halloween they always had a Halloween party for the kids and at Christmas, Christmas parties.  So they allowed us to be kids, but they also put their time to make sure that we were going to be somebody.  We were going to give something back.  And they always took us wherever they went.  So we saw, we saw things a child, children should see, but we saw the adult side of life and we saw that there were people less fortunate than us.  And not to look down on them because they were less fortunate than us, but to give something back to help them.  Make them feel like they're equal.  I don't like people that look down on other people because, by the blessing of God, you could be in that situation and the other person could be on top and you could be on the bottom, the so-called bottom.
Story_ID: 11021
Speaker 1: You were in college during, I guess the late '60s [1960s] correct?
Speaker 2: No, '74 [1974] to '78 [1978], I attended the Illinois Institute of Technology [Chicago, Illinois] which is located right next door to De La Salle [Institute, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: And what was life, college like?
Speaker 2: IIT [Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, Illinois] was unique because I felt that dealing with the situation I dealt with in Institute, where there was, I won't say blatant racism, but there was all that tinge of racism.  I felt that going to an academic school like IIT, which is considered a highly academic school, that I would get away from some of it.  IIT only had at the time that I was enrolled there, they only had sixty-seven African Americans in the whole school.  So we were a close-knit unit.  And I had a counselor my freshman year that I could never get to see.  I don't know whether or not it was intentional or not.  At the time, there were only two African Americans majoring in mathematics.  And each time that I did get to meet with him, he was drunk.  (Laughs)  So IIT was, it made me realize when I went to De La Salle that if I thought I was smart, I wasn't as smart as I thought I was (laughs) because you were put into an environment where there was, you were with a highly competitive students in there also.  One thing about IIT, most of the--when you graduate from Illinois Institute of Technology, you have accomplished something and your, your value to the workforce is guaranteed.
Speaker 1: So, in IIT, did you, were you able to uphold your banner of superior student?
Speaker 2: No, not really.  (Laughs.)  I just basically slid through. (Laughs)
Speaker 1: When did you discover you were going downhill?
Speaker 2: From my freshman year.  My freshman year my class load at IIT, I had calculus, physics, chemistry, graphic design and I hadn't taken physics in Institute.  So that kind of caught me behind the eight ball.  And calculus, so I was able to kind of deal with calculus, but that physics got to me.
Speaker 1: How did you, what were your fun days, your college student days like as far as--.
Speaker 2: Well, I was able to get to know some young men from different parts of the country.  Being able--at the time, when we were in college, the drinking age was nineteen, so you were able to enjoy, partake in the alcohol at an early age.  Chicago was a little bit more exciting.  They had places like Hyde Park, the Lincoln Park area [neighborhoods in Chicago], that going to nightclubs and just enjoying, doing things that, enjoying the freedom of being a college, man.  One thing about the Illinois Institute of Technology, most of the students there commute.  So during the time that I was at IIT, I lived at home.
Speaker 1: Did you form any friendships that remained, any special bonds?
Speaker 2: Our bonds are so tight.  A friend of mine, he was from Atlanta [Georgia], John Robinson.  He just called me this week to let me know when he's coming in town and most of the time we, we try to see each other.  It's about a tight-knit group of about twenty of us still that have kept in touch.
Story_ID: 11022
Speaker 1: Tell me about your transition from college into work life.
Speaker 2: Well, after college [Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, Illinois] I was hired by People's Gas Light & Coke Company.  I started there in 1978 as a customer service--as a junior customer service representative.  People's Gas, my experience at People's Gas has been pleasant.  I enjoyed the eighteen years that I was employed there, but I saw a side of the corporate world that did not impress me favorably.  And that's probably when we get further along into my, into the tale that we are getting into as far as my career, it probably would have led me to become a legislator.
Speaker 1: So, at what point did you know you were going into the political arena?
Speaker 2: I didn't.  I'm very unique as far as my peers in the [Illinois] General Assembly.  In 1986, then [Illinois State] Senator Charles Chew [Jr.], unfortunately passed away.  The representative at the time, Ethel Skyles Alexander, it was a pretty much a given that she was going to be appointed to fill his vacancy.  I got a phone call late one night saying that we would like you to consider the position of state representative of the 32nd District.  And at the time I told them that you've got to be kidding.  Why would I want to do something like that?  I had a nice job with People's Gas and I knew what, what this position would entail. And why me?  And it took me, well, it took a five-minute conversation.  I had to make my decision in that five minutes.  Of course, at the time in 1986, Harold Washington was the mayor.  And the selection as I found out, or the me being considered, went all the way up to the top, which he at the time was at the top.  So, it was very hard to turn down Mayor Harold Washington.  I knew Harold when he was a representative and a state senator.  I have, of course, had the privilege of campaigning in his first election in 1983.  And at the time I was kind of fed up with some of the things that I was having to go through at People's Gas, and I was considering possibly going back to school. This came into my lap and I was not able to consult with anyone because this was all hush-hush and I prayed on it, and my final, final way--really what made me make my decision was, I was only twenty-nine, thirty years old at the time, and I said you don't want to be bitter ten to fifteen years from now saying what you should have done, could have done.  And I just felt that I could do something for my community because some of the things that I have started to see.  The unfairness of the haves and the have-nots.
Speaker 1: Tell me of your political activity in various campaigns or various political circles prior to your being drafted from college to your being drafted to run.
Speaker 2: Like I said, because of the fact I was involved in politics or was in my first campaign--participated in campaigning when I was six, my father [Charles Gay Morrow, II], who was a legislative assistant to [Illinois State Representative] Ray [Raymond] Ewell, was a member of Colonel Bill Shannon--Alderman Bill Shannon who was the alderman of the 17th Ward who had a very powerful political organization.  At the time, in the '60s [1960s], the 17th Ward, Democratic organization was on the par as the 8th Ward organization with John Stroger or the 6th Ward organization with Eugene Sawyer at that time.  And in fact, if you'll allow me, I'm going to tell the real history of why Harold Washington was made.  Everyone says about how Harold Washington was made.  Back then, in the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s], pretty much candidates that were slated by the party were a shoo-in to win.  I believe Congressman [William Levi] Dawson had just passed at the time.  And the powers to be wanted late Senator Jim [James C.] Taylor to fill the appointment of U.S. Congressman.  Well, Alderman Bill Shannon threw his weighed vote behind Harold Washington, State Senator Harold Washington, and that led Harold Washington on to [U.S.] Congress and on to what he was able to accomplish.  Because of Alderman Shannon doing that, and going against the Democratic Party at that time, he was slated for defeat in his next reelection.  So, my involvement with the 17th Ward organization, campaigning for the likes of Raymond Ewell or Eugene Barnes, was representative at that time because at that time, legislative districts weren't single members.  They were three member districts and you ran district-wide.  You ran the whole senatorial district.  And Charlie Gaines, late Representative Charlie Gaines was the Republican in the district.  So it was two Democrats and one, one Republican.  The fact that I did not go away to college, I went to IIT [Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, Illinois] as I said, I was still in the city, I was still able to be involved in the local political scene, which kept my name in people's heads.  And, I wasn't, I was not the first choice to, to fill the vacancy.  I was the, the choice that everyone compromised on because of the fact that people knew me and I guess I had a good name, a good reputation at that time.
Story_ID: 11023
Speaker 1: My early years, I had to earn it. Because of the fact that I was appointed [Illinois state representative], I had to prove that I deserved it and earned it.  And some of the political powers in the district were opposed to me and I had to overcome that.  [Eugene] Gene Sawyer was opposed to me.  And he was the mayor [of Chicago, Illinois] at the time.  And so to beat the mayor, well.
Speaker 2: You did not get a lot of friends then.
Speaker 1: No, no, no, but that's all right, I don't need a lot of friends.  Are we back on tape?  Okay.
Speaker 2: But what was that whole period like for you as you were going through it?  Tell me some of the thoughts and feelings you were having being surprised, working hard, but surprised at winning and then to discover not everybody's happy about this.
Speaker 1: Well, I learned in life as far as when I first was appointed in office, I was nominated July 12, 1986, and like I said, I had to make, make, make my decision to accept the appointment, and I never forget, like I said, I was not able to consult with anyone.  The Friday night before the appointment process, I set down with my mother [Lillian Suzann Reescher Morrow] and let her know that I was going to be appointed representative the next day.  And she just looked at me because it was a shock to her.  And she said, "Well, you sure you want to do that?  Have you thought it through?"  And, because this was all happening so fast, and I said, "Yeah, I've kind of thought it through." So we went through the process that Saturday, the appointment process and the ward committeemen who had the weighed vote in this decision were Alderman [Eugene] Gene Sawyer, at the time he was, I forget what positions Cecil Partee was in, I think he was the [Chicago, Illinois] City Treasurer.  And there was, he was the ward committeeman of the 20th Ward, Gene Sawyer was the committeeman of the 6th Ward.  Alderman Anna Langford was the ward committeeman of the 16th Ward.  Alderman Allan Streeter, who was my, the person who was nominating me, I was the ward committeeman in the 17th Ward.  So we're sitting at the church, I can't think of the name of the church right now.  The first process they did was the filling the vacancy of senator, state senator.  So they made the nominations and tallied the weighed votes and the choice of state senator was unanimous.  Alderman Sawyer had a candidate that he felt should be appointed, Ron Robinson, who became the alderman of the 6th Ward after Gene Sawyer was appointed mayor.  And there was some political back-scene stuff, and really didn't know the outcome until the last minute.  So people had to do some arm-twisting.  And I'll never forget, my mother was there, supposedly just to witness this event, and she ended up nominating me.  And when she made the nomination, she said, "I nominate my son, Charles Gay Morrow, III for representative."  And basically, she said, "Because he's my son."  So that drew a big laugh from everybody and I won the, I was the, I think, the first ballot was a tie.  And then the second ballot, when they saw that I was going eventually be selected, the ward committeemen that were, that had voted against me on the first ballot, they acquiesced and made it unanimous also.
Story_ID: 11024
Speaker 1: On July 12th, 1986, was the process to fill the vacancy of state senator which then [Illinois State] Representative Ethel Skyles Alexander was the, was the unanimous choice to fill the vacancy. But then the process to fill the vacancy for representative was a contested issue.  Alderman [Eugene] Gene Sawyer had a candidate, Ronald Robinson, who replaced him as alderman when he replaced Harold Washington as Mayor [of Chicago, Illinois after Washington's death].  And on the first ballot they didn't, couldn't come to a consensus. I guess it was a tie.  And then on the second ballot I guess because of some behind the scene maneuverings some people were held to their commitments.  I was able to get the weighed vote, and to win the appointment for representative.
Speaker 2: And you say the nomination came about in an unusual way.  Do you want to tell us about that?
Speaker 1: My mother [Lillian Suzann Reescher Morrow] was the person that nominated me.  And she didn't know that she would have to do, have that chore.  And she got up to nominate me and said, "I nominate my, Charles G. Morrow, III for state representative because he's my son."  And which drew laughter from the audience.  And she, because she was still in shock that because this thing was going so fast, and I was in shock.  And that's what happened that day and then I was sworn in July 16th, and had a meeting with then Mayor Harold Washington.  In fact, my mother made me buy a new suit.  I had to go meet the mayor.  And I never forget the advice Harold Washington gave me, and that's pretty much the advice that I have followed pretty much my whole career, political career.  He told me, he said, "Never forget where you come from."  And I've taken that course.  Politics being in a so-called position of power, you need to keep your ego in check and have family and friends who can keep your ego in check because you do get full of yourself.
Story_ID: 11025
Speaker 1: On July 12, 1986, the process to fill the vacancy for state senator was held in a church and then [Illinois State] Representative Ethel Skyles Alexander was the unanimous choice to fill the vacancy for state senator, or the appointment to fill the vacancy for state representative was a race between myself and a gentleman by the name of Ronald Robinson, who became alderman of the 6th Ward after Alderman [Eugene] Gene Sawyer was appointed Mayor [of Chicago, Illinois] when Harold Washington passed away.  The first ballot was, was, was contested.  I don't know if it was a tie or not, but on the second ballot, some commitments were forced to be kept and I was then appointed [Illinois State] representative.  My mother nominated me.  When she nominated me, she basically said, "I'm nominating Charles G. Morrow III because I feel he can do the job and he's my son."  Which drew laughter from the audience, of course.  And I was then sworn in on July 16, 1986, by Judge Carl McCormick who was a long time friend of my family and who went on to become appellate court judge.
Speaker 2: (Off-camera discussion)
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: What were those first few weeks, months, and years like for you?
Speaker 1: Well, the first time I, I sat in my, my district office, about a week after I was appointed, I just sat there and was wondering what was I going to do.  What agenda was I going to have?  I then began to get phone calls from different black clubs and community groups wanting me to attend their next meetings because they wanted to get to know me.  I pretty much just tried to get my office and my, hire my legislative assistant.  As my senator told me, first thing you better do is get on the payroll.  So we rode the train downstate, down to Springfield [Illinois] and that three hours were the best three hours in my, in my beginning of my political career because [Illinois State] Senator [Ethel Skyles] Alexander basically held me by the hand my first two or three terms down in Springfield, taught me how to form my agenda, my legislative agenda, taught me how to get my agenda passed, of course, out of the house.  And one of the misconceptions freshmen or newcomers have to the [Illinois] General Assembly, you can get your bill passed out of the House because the House is pretty much been in, the Democrats have been in the majority.  But you got to get your bill out of the Senate.  And then once you get your bill out of the Senate, you got to get the governor to sign it.  And it takes years for some legislators to understand that process.  Not only when you pass legislation, you have to look at the fact that there might be a cost factor that goes along with your legislation.  That was something I had to learn.  To learn the appropriations side of legislation.  You cannot create new programs within government without having the revenue to fulfill the program.  And that's the tricky part of politics.  Getting, getting the funding.

Speaker 1: And so, your first day of participating in a full session, do you recall what that felt like?
Speaker 2: It was exciting.  I was at the time--because I was appointed [Illinois state representative], I was the 118th member in the [Illinois] General Assembly, so I was the lowest person on the totem pole.  (Laughs)  So, I came down there with a humble attitude and wanted to just learn.  And I pretty much kept my mouth shut.  I saw some things that I didn't like.  And I waited for my time to be vocal.  I felt that it was just, it was important to read, to read the bills I was voting on, to read the legislation, to build a rapport with my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans [political parties].  The General Assembly, at least in the House, members in the House of Representatives tend to be younger than the members of the Senate.  Our ideals are a little bit more radical.  In fact, the House of Representatives, we're considered 'the House of the People' and the Senate's considered 'the House of the Lord'.  And it balances sometimes, because we might pass, we might pass some legislation that might not be, might not have been well thought out and the Senate kind of, slow down, you know, the world is still turning. And so you learn--I learned my first years to build a relationship with my colleagues.  And the only thing that you can bring into politics is your name and your word. That's all you leave is with is your name and your word.  And you have to leave--first of all, I feel I have to leave my name to my boys [sons Charles Morrow IV, Michael Morrow, Steven Morrow] in good standing, as my father [Charles Gay Morrow II] and my mother [Lillian Suzann Reescher Morrow] did to me.  Your word is your bond in Springfield [Illinois].  If I say that I'm going to commit to a vote on a piece of legislation that you want me to vote on, I have to keep my word.  I learned that, I learned not to commit early on votes until I can thoroughly digest the legislation.  I learned not to commit my vote early, because you don't want to always play your hand.  Your vote is not as powerful when you're the sixty-first vote as it is when you're the fifty-seventh vote.  So you learn how to use your vote to negotiate things for your district.
Speaker 1: How would you define your political service in the state legislature up to this point?
Speaker 2: Well, when I was appointed in 1986, a former [U.S.] Senator Carol Moseley Braun, was the [Illinois State] representative at the time.  She was Assistant Majority Leader down in Springfield.  And one of the things that she told me that there's three kind of legislators that you can be.  One that passes, passes a lot of bills, one that gets a lot of media coverage, or one that does the work of your constituents.  A constituent legislator.  I chose the third.  To be service-oriented.  When my constituents come to my office, or call my office with issues, I try to do my best to resolve their issues.  Of course, you're not able to do that to the satisfaction of every, every constituent, but I think my reputation in my district is, if you come to me with an issue, I'm going to look into it.  I'm not going to just put it to the side, or have a lack of interest in your issue.  I'm going, I'm going to tackle it.  That's where my nickname 'Pit Bull' comes from also.  I don't give up very easily.  I'm not, I'm not dissuaded or persuaded. I'm not intimidated by the powers that be.  I feel that my constituents deserve what any other constituent should have.  My district at the time that I was appointed covered Woodlawn and Englewood, which are low income and economically distressed communities [in Chicago, Illinois].  They were in 1986 and they still are in the year 2000.  I also had Chatham and West Chatham, which were middle-class to upper middle-class communities in my district.  So I had the haves and have-nots.  My district in 1986 was 99 percent African American.  So, I had a district where the ethnic background was the same, but I felt that I had to serve the have-nots even more than the haves.  And I felt in my first year what was my role.
Story_ID: 11027
Speaker 1: Can you tell us about your perspective on state legislators in Illinois given there was a period of so called in quotes "heavily taxed" and then the developing state legislator now which tends to be a professional person in business?
Speaker 2: State representatives and state senators, at least in the Chicagoland, Cook County [Illinois] area, we've always been on the lowest as far as the political hierarchy in the city of Chicago [Illinois].  Most people or citizens of the city of Chicago can identify with their aldermen. Most of them can name who their aldermen are.  Most cannot name who their state representative or state senator is.  So, we've always been at the bottom of the totem pole politically.  There was a time in Springfield [Illinois] that black legislators weren't allowed to stay in hotels.  I, I remember that time.  You have to go back to the days of [State Senator] Ethel Skyles Alexander's father, Charles Skyles, when he served in the '40s [1940s], the, what we call the Dean of the House, who, [Illinois State Representative] Corneal Davis, or [Illinois State] Senator Fred Smith, the late husband of Senator Margaret Smith, those guys took a lot.  They took, they took a lot because they were denied the opportunity to stay in adequate housing or descent housing.  So, they had to stay in the homes of the black families down, downstate, down in Springfield.  The political hierarchy in Chicago at that time was the first Mayor Richard [J.] Daley.  So most of the black aldermen were pretty much under his foot, under his thumb.  Patronage was, existed at that time.  People in the, in various organizations were rewarded the job of state representative or state senator based on their service to the organization.  Back then, they appointed older men, men in their middle age, that were not as energetic as far as community issues.  And they couldn't be energetic because they, they were ultimately told what to do by their alderman who was told what to do by the fifth floor of city hall.  There's a word that people use that I have never used publicly toward any black elected official, is the word Uncle Tom.  Things were different then.  The political climate was different then.  And I tell people they took it so now I don't have to take it.  And you're right, now, legislature, at least we in the [Illinois] General Assembly.  Now, as you probably are aware, most city aldermen under this current Mayor Richard [M.] Daley, are basically going back to the old style politics.  We in the General Assembly are independent.  Most of us are not aligned with an aldermanic political organization.  And so, we have some independence, which came about from Harold Washington, when he became mayor.
Story_ID: 11028
Speaker 1: When I first became a [Illinois State] representative I was aligned with Alderman Allan Streeter.  Because of the misfortunes that he had with 'Operation Silver Shovel' [FBI probe into the possible corruption of Chicago's elected officials], I was able to break away from him, with my name and my integrity intact and I never looked back.  People wanted me to criticize him because of his involvement in that situation and trying to bring me down and various members of the [Illinois] General Assembly involved in that situation.  And I never forget a news reporter asked me one day, was I mad at him?  And I told him I would have been mad at myself if I'd fallen for the ruse.  He gave me my start, I outgrew him.  But I'm not going to publicly knock anybody.  And that's my attitude about it.
Speaker 2: What was the ruse you were referring to, falling for?
Speaker 1: (Laughs)  He was caught doing some things illegally as part of this Operation Silver Shovel, and he told the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] that he could bring various other state legislators into a scam that they were going to do.
Speaker 2: Did you mention his name, since, when, after today, we won't know.  When you say "he."
Speaker 1: Alderman Allan Streeter went to the FBI and said that he could, in order to cover his, to get more, I guess, leniency, or consideration from the FBI that he could assist in an undercover sting to entrap members of the General Assembly.  And because I felt--I guess he felt because we shared offices, I was pretty much going to fall for the trap.  Well, I didn't.  And it was a rough time in my, in fact, it was probably the worst time in my political career because there were rumors and innuendos and pressures put on me.  I found out who my friends were.  In politics you never have permanent friends or permanent enemies.  But I really found out who my friends were.  And I had just gotten married [to Sherri Harris Morrow].  My mother [Lillian Suzann Reescher Morrow] had passed away and so there were a lot of outside pressures on me.  But my family and my faith were there and that's what, I learned that's who to count on.  Don't count on anybody else.
Speaker 2: How did all that affect you just from the personal standpoint?
Speaker 1: Well, like I said, some friends of mine, that I stood by them through their trials and tribulations, deserted me.  And, it was hard, it was hard, it was hard, but, in fact, people that were real close to me turned on me.  And it was my faith and the fact that I knew that I did nothing wrong and wouldn't do anything wrong.  It was, even if this situation had not happened with Alderman Streeter, it was time for us to part our ways.  I was--I had been in office ten years and you know how you outgrow people.  I had outgrew him.  And he knew him.  He knew that I had outgrew him.  And so it taught me that you have to take this job seriously and you have to be careful who you associate with.  You have to be careful with some of the things that people bring to you.  I try to assist people and sometimes you have to be careful with who you try to help.  I learned not to be so naive.
Story_ID: 11029
Speaker 1: Of course, you did have a mentor, this train ride to Springfield [Illinois] really helped you.  How much other help did you get from that kind of direction?
Speaker 2: Well, like I said, [Illinois state representative] Ray [Raymond] Ewell was really my mentor.  He was the one that put me up to this. In fact, I tease him sometimes.  I say, "You know, I want to curse you and bless you in the same breath."  [Illinois State Representative Eugene] Gene Barnes, Carol Moseley Braun, Ethel Skyles Alexander, of course. I've been fortunate to have some very fantastic state senators.  I've had Ethel Skyles Alexander, Alice Palmer, and now my current [Illinois State] senator is Barack Obama.  I've been able to get along with them.  We've been able to protect ourselves as far as our voting records in our district.  As far as bringing back perks for our constituents and we've gotten along well. Representative Bob [Robert J.] LeFlore who was [Illinois State] Chairman of the House Black Caucus before he passed away and I replaced him.  People like State Representative Arthur [L.] Turner, former Representative Paul [L.] Williams, Lou [Lovana S.] Jones.  In fact, Paul Williams, Lou Jones, Monique [D.] Davis, and Shirley [M.] Jones, we all came in at the same time.  And we were part of that first breed of pretty much the independent legislators.  And people used to call us the 'Five Crazies' because we didn't follow the party line down in Springfield.  We gave [Michael] Madigan a rough go--[Illinois House of Representatives] Speaker Michael Madigan a rough go of it.  And we still do.  (Laughs)
Speaker 1: And this was all in the 1980s?
Speaker 2: In the 19--yeah, from pretty much.  I served with Carol Moseley Braun for, this period of time we're pretty much talking about from 1986 to about 1994.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have anything you want to say about your relationship with Harold Washington and how that affected you personally and or professionally?
Speaker 2: Well, I'll go to my grave thanking him for giving me this opportunity.
Speaker 1: We just need you to say who--.
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sorry.  I'll go to my grave thanking late Mayor Harold Washington for the opportunity to serve my community.  As I said earlier, I knew Harold Washington when he was [Illinois State] Representative Washington and [Illinois] State Senator Washington.  And Harold Washington was, because I'm kind of a small guy, I'm only 5 [feet] 7 [inches], about 160 pounds.  Harold was kind of like a big teddy bear.  And there's things that you have to do as a legislator, voting on issues down in Springfield, that you have to separate your personal opinion from the political opinion.  And as in the [Chicago, Illinois] City Council, well, the City Council wars that existed at that time. Some of that kind of filtered down to Springfield.  And so it was important for we, as black legislators, to protect Harold Washington's agenda in Springfield.  Which meant sometimes taking some votes that I really didn't want to take, but because I was part of the team, the Harold Washington team, I did.  And the one good thing about it, he never forgot some of the hits we took for him down in Springfield.  When we would come back to the city, he would give you that big bear hug, and, "Thanks, old good buddy, Charlie, you came through for me."  And you'd just say, "Only for you, Harold."  (Laughs)
Speaker 1: But he understood what a sacrifice--.
Speaker 2: Well, back at that time, and this is one of the mistakes I did not make when I was appointed.  Harold, the Mayor Harold Washington, felt he was going to serve twenty years.  Well, unfortunately, he only served four years, right?  And so a lot of people, elected officials, neglected their duties because they felt as long as they were going to be endorsed by Harold Washington, they were going to win.  I was told by my advisors and my mentors, you get out there and earn it.  Okay, and that's what I did.  I earned it. Some people at the time that he passed away, they were waiting for their letter of endorsement from the mayor.  Well, I never sought that letter, because my attitude is, I just need the endorsement of my constituents.  So, I'm not a big person of I'm endorsed by this alderman, or I'm endorsed by this interest group.  Even though I do appreciate their assistance, and I do acknowledge their assistance, but the final decision of who, or whether or not I'm going to serve another term is up to the voters.
Story_ID: 11030
Speaker 1: Bring us up to the moment from the time you were (unclear) acclimated, let's say from when the national scene started to change and how that impacted you.
Speaker 2: Well, before I get to the national scene, let's go back to when my district changed to my current district.  Reapportionment was in 1992, of course, which I dreaded.  I'm dreading going through reapportionment in next year or voting on our new boundaries, because in 1991, I was drawn out of my district by across the street.  Some say it was political revenge (laughs) but I had to move into my current district.
Speaker 1: And before you, would you define reapportionment for us?
Speaker 2: Reapportionment occurs every ten years.  It occurs the year after you take the census count. You do the census every two years and reapportionment, your boundaries for your new district is determined by the population shift, a gain in population or loss in population.  As I said earlier, when I served as the legislator of the 32nd District, I had a 99 percent African American, voter.  In 1992, my percentage dropped to 72 percent African American, 20 percent Caucasian, 8 percent Latino, and 2 percent other.  Which you'd be surprised that other is, I have a pretty sizeable Arabic population in my district.  My current district goes from Dorchester [Avenue] to Central Park [Avenue], 79th [Street] to 67th Street [Chicago, Illinois].  I have Marquette Park [neighborhood in Chicago, Illinois] in my district, which is the infamous park where Dr. Martin Luther King [Jr.] was stoned over twenty-five years ago [1966].  So the, every ten years when we go through this reapportionment process, you lose a lot of the [Illinois] General Assembly.  It's a pretty much a big roll over.  That's where my ability in seniority increased because of the roll over.  So you, so we being to get a more conservative type of legislature.  For, from 1995 to 1996, the Democrat, Democratic Party was in the minority.  And I never forget colleagues of mine saying that you'll never forget this process, so you'll appreciate this process once you become a minority party, because your ability to serve your community is nil.  Especially being a Democrat and a minority Democrat.  So I was a double minority. And the Republicans at that time, because of the national scene when [Speaker of the United States House of Representatives] Newt Gingrich and what was their little phrase "the contract with America."  They were kind of harsh on us Democrats.  Unusually harsh.  And when we won the House back in 1997, we wanted revenge.  And wanted things that Speaker Madigan insisted upon that we show compassion.  That we were going to show that we were the party of adults.  We were the compassionate party.  He began to recruit conservative Democrats to run for offices because the bottom line is, you want to be in control of the House [of Representatives].  Your ability controls the House determines who sits down at that forty-nine billion dollar pie.
Story_ID: 11031
Speaker 1: So now we have the new African American state legislator.  How would you describe that composite person today in Illinois?
Speaker 2: Well, we're young.  I would say in the [State of Illinois] House of Representatives almost two thirds of us are in our forties or thirties.  Which twenty years ago you never would have had that, had that, had that phenomenon.  The [Illinois] General Assembly is more of a type of a citizen body now, which I'm glad.  I felt that when I first became, became a legislator, that there were too many lawyers or people that wanted to serve their own little interest groups.  So we have more citizen-type legislators but we also have legislators that really don't understand the value of their vote and the importance of being independent from leadership.  My attitude has always been that I vote for [Illinois House of Representatives Speaker] Michael Madigan to be my Democratic [party] leader in the House.  You're the speaker.  But I elected you to be the speaker, so you're there to serve my interests.  I will try to serve the interests of the party.  I do run as a Democrat, but my first priority is to serve my district.  So when there's issues or bills or an agenda being forwarded that's not in the best interest of my district, I will vote my conscience.  As [U.S.] Congressmen Jesse Jackson, Jr. said one time, "I'll vote with the party that serves my interest that day."  There are times that I've had to depend on the other side of the aisle, the Republicans [political party], to pass my legislation because the colleagues on my side of the aisle, the Democrats, were opposed to it.
Story_ID: 11032
Speaker 1: Can you tell me how your personal life now has been impacted by your position as a statesman and how you negotiate those things?
Speaker 2: Well, for the last seven years, I've, I've, I've, I've, I've been married, so right there, that's slowed down some things.  My wife's name is Sherri Harris Morrow.  We were married July 17, 1993, I better get that right.  And we have three boys, Charles Gay Morrow, IV who will be 6 August 4th,  Michael Seay Morrow, who will be 4 December 2nd and my youngest son, Steven Jordan Morrow, was just born January 14th of this year [2000].  So, because of when I went through some hard times in my political career, my focuses went to my family.  My priorities are my family first, politics second.  I don't bring politics into my house.  When I was single, I would let people call me on political issues at my house.  I don't allow that anymore.  As my son told me, he said, "This is my house."  So, I realize it is his house, and because you can get tense dealing with political issues because of the certain decisions and considerations that you have to take into account, subconsciously or consciously, sometimes that, that pressure tends to overflow into your relationship with your wife or your sons and sometimes you're not fair to them when you do that.
Story_ID: 11033
Speaker 1: What would you like for your, to be remembered for?  For your years in the [Illinois] state legislature?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I, I could name some of the individual achievements as far as legislation or capital improvement projects in my district, but I think, I think my most important thing that I've brought over the last fourteen years is that my constituents feel that they can come to me and they feel that I'm not--politicians tend to separate themselves from their electorate until it's time for them to vote for them.  My constituents know that I'm there for them whether or not I'm in my district office here in Chicago [Illinois] or whether or not I'm down in Springfield [Illinois] working.  I will call them wherever I am.  I'm known as a person who responds.  People say that if you call Charles Morrow's office, you will get a response.
Speaker 1: And finally, is there anything I should have asked you that perhaps I missed?
Speaker 2: Well, basically, I guess I can take the time to name some legislative accomplishments.  In 1994, we opened up the Thurgood Marshall Library over on 75th [Street] and Racine [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois].  I was able to acquire the funds for that capital improvement.  We give [Illinois] General Assembly scholarships, which are tuition waivers for college students to state public universities.  I've been able to send a number, a sizeable number of students through college, not only undergraduate school, but graduate school.  I've been able to graduate doctors, dentists.  As the appropriation chairman of public safety, I had a lot to do with the governor's first program.  In fact, my colleagues last year jokingly called me the 'King of Pork' because out of his program, the twelve billion dollar program, I had the largest capital improvement project in there, which is the reconstruction of the Dan Ryan--Dan Ryan Expressway at over five hundred million dollars.  When we did the electrical deregulation three years ago, I was able to put a revenue stream of over 76 million dollars for low-income people to assist them in keeping their gas and electricity on.  I can name a lot of things, but I think my legacy politically is intact.  Personally, all I want to do is leave my name in good standing to my boys [sons Charles Morrow, IV, Michael Morrow, Steven Morrow] .  That's all I can do and my word.
Story_ID: 11034
Speaker 1: How do you suggest that we get the electorate and young people to be more aware of the importance of state legislators?
Speaker 2: Well, we have, we have, as far as the voting process, like I said, I have Chatham and Englewood [neighborhoods in Chicago, Illinois].  Well, West Chatham, Chatham, excuse me, has some of the highest voting percentages in the city of Chicago.  African American, Caucasian or any other ward.  I also have Englewood, where the voter turnout in Englewood in some precincts are as low as 13 percent.  And that determines how your community is going to look.  That determines my ability to bring capital improvement projects to that area as far as new schools or job training programs, things of that type.  We somehow have to teach our kids that you have to serve and my generation, because we've been able to become better educated than our parents and become more upwardly mobile, we tend to have forgotten that we didn't get where we are on our own.  I have friends that I asked to go to career days at school because they're vice presidents of companies, and they can't take the time to do that, but you can spend all day on the golf course.  Well, when your day--I feel this very strongly, when your day comes that you have to answer to Saint Peter, he's not going to say how much money did you make or how many titles that you have.  He's going to ask you what did you do, what did you give back?  Who did you help?  Who did you serve?  And if the answers is no, I think there's a trap door right there for you. (Laughs)  And I think that's all I can bring to the table.  I've been able to serve people, people that don't like me.  But politics is not, it's not about popularity.  Politics is about the ability to do the job.  I tell my voters--I've never asked anyone to vote for me.  You might say that's ironic and kind of stupid.  My, my, my philosophy on that is if you think I'm doing the job, I know what you're doing in that voting booth.  And if you don't think I'm doing the job, I also know what you'd do.  And I can live with that.
Story_ID: 11035
Speaker 1: Can you tell us how you came to the [Illinois] state legislature the first time, the state legislature the first time?
Speaker 2: Well, I had never considered running for political office.  In fact, I received a five-minute phone call when [Illinois State] Senator [Charles] Charlie Chew had passed and the vacancy of state senator was open and [Illinois State] Representative Ethel Skyles Alexander was pretty much guaranteed to fill that vacancy.  And the ward committeemen in the district were haggling over who would fill that vacancy and my name came up and kind of, not as the first choice, but kind of as a choice that everyone could live with.  And the call came from my mentor, [Illinois State Representative] Ray [Raymond] Ewell who at the time was serving as a lobbyist for [Chicago, Illinois Mayor] Harold Washington in Springfield [Illinois].  And we argued tit and tat for every reason he had for me to do it, I had a reason not to do it.  And when he finally said that this call comes from the mayor of the city [of Chicago], Harold Washington, it was hard to turn the mayor down.  I'd known him when he was a state representative and a state senator.  And I just felt being a man of twenty-nine or thirty years old at the time, I didn't want to be bitter about what I should have done or could have done, and could do with my community.
Speaker 1: And can you tell me why it was that your mother [Lillian Suzann Reescher Morrow] was the person to stand up and nominate you?
Speaker 2: Basically, because I only had two friends (laughing) in the room at that time.  [Eugene] Gene Barnes--Raymond Ewell couldn't nominate me for some reason.  Gene Barnes, former [Illinois State] Representative Gene Barnes did the opening nomination and my mother did the closing nomination.  So it just, it came down to numbers.
Speaker 1: (Tape interruption)
Speaker 2: The question is, how you determined or how do you lead up to the process of being a political candidate?  The one great thing about this country that we live in, to run for politics is one of the few jobs that you don't have to have a resume.  If you're able to get enough signatures to get on the ballot, and if you're able to convince enough people in your agenda, and your ability to serve and represent them, then you have an opportunity to become their elected representative.  There are colleagues of mine that took two or three times in the running for office before they finally ran.  One thing about politicians, we're a breed of determined people.  As I mentioned earlier, there are two types of people in this world,  those who are intimidated and those who are not intimidated.  It's very hard to intimidate a politician.  We're, we're, we're survivors.  I tell my wife [Sherri Harris Morrow], or I told my wife before we got married, I said, "There are going to be people that won't like you because you're married to me."  It took her a while to understand that.  We have a bad name, a bad reputation.  Some of it deserving, but sometimes it's not deserving because people don't really get to know us as a person because they see us as the politician.  And we're not perfect.  We're everyday people.  We, we make mistakes.  You try not to make illegal mistakes, but we're not perfect.  People tend to think that we have a lifestyle that's here.  I have to pay my light and gas bill and my mortgage or my car note just like you.  Otherwise, my house will get foreclosed (laughing) just like yours will.  It has its perks.  It has its advantages.  But I tend to be a low-keyed everyday legislator.  I've been blessed.  I've been blessed to do this job.  I've been blessed to serve my constituents.  And in closing, I'll say this, if you look at my birth certificate it says Charles Morrow, III.  It doesn't say [Illinois] State Representative Charles Morrow.  One day, I'm going to be Charles Morrow again.  The key is when I leave office, do I leave office on my terms, with my name intact, my integrity intact.  Or do I leave office on the people's term, which means that I've done something wrong.

Speaker 1: This photograph here is part of a brochure that I had printed up in the year 2000.  It's a public service brochure about African American inventors.  I've gone through about sixty thousand of those.
Speaker 2: [Portrait of Charles Morrow from his public service brochure on African American inventors, Chicago, Illinois, 2000.  From the collection of Charles G. Morrow, III.]

Speaker 1: I got the concept of doing this brochure when I visited my sister in California last year.  They had, she had a poster in her house about African American inventors and their inventions.  And I was shocked at some of the inventions that have been created by African Americans.  I thought I had a pretty knowledgeable feel for what African Americans have, have contributed to our country, but I was shocked at some of the inventions that were created by African Americans and I felt it was important that this information be passed on to our young people. (Pause) I mean if you read some of the inventions that we've created, the helicopter, gas masks, some of the, you'd be surprised what, what, what we brought to the table.  So especially it's important when we're talking about the issue of reparations.  You know, because some people would take a million dollars, I told them, I, let me name what I'm worth, because one of the things I'm about to sit down with [U.S.] Congressman [Bobby L.] Rush on, someone in my community got a copy of the brochure and he came by my office and gave me a book.  A gentleman by the name of James Montgomery in the late '70s [1970s] early '80s [1980s] was going to do a three-volume bio [biography] on African American inventors.  He completed his first volume, and unfortunately, went to jail for embezzlement.  (Laughs)  And he never finished the other two volumes.  And I want to sit down with the congressman because most of these patents would be with the U.S. Patent Office of course, and if he could do some research and get some more data on these inventors where some of our school kids would be able to research and do papers.  Just to know what they've accomplished.  Some of the inventors, a lot of the inventors I knew, but a lot of them I had no concept.  This gentleman, Frederick Jones, he invented the defroster, the air conditioning unit.  Things of that type, that type.  The bottle cap, the helicopter, lock, video remote control was invented by an African American.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) blood plasma.  Door knob.
Speaker 1: That I knew.  And it's unfortunate Charles Drew, the inventor of blood plasma, died because of a lack of a blood transfusion--,
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: --in North Carolina because he was African American.  Yeah.  So think how many lives he saved in World War II with his invention, how many Caucasian lives.
