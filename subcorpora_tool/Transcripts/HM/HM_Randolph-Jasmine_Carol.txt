Speaker 1: Now, is there a story behind the name, Jasmine?  I haven't heard that as a-
Speaker 2: That's my husband's name.  So at this point, I'm claiming, you know, all that he is, along with me, so, that's the Jasmine part.

Speaker 1: And what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: Hard to explain, but I started out as a teacher, went into the media, and now I work with--as an attorney, working with a construction company, putting up an academy for construction and design for kids.  So, how do I explain that?
Speaker 1: Well, it's successful, that's all that really matters.  You're doing something positive.  So what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is December the 4th, oh, December the 5th, yeah 19--oh, sorry, December the 5th, 2013.

Speaker 2: We are here in Washington, D.C.
Story_ID: 117599
Speaker 1: Okay.  And before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions I always ask as kind of a warm up, and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: First one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Broccoli.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Yellow.
Speaker 1: All right, a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Fall.

Speaker 2: Hilton Head [South Carolina] .
Speaker 1: Favorite--the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Better to wear out than rust out.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 117600
Speaker 1: So I'm going to ask about your family history now.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, starting with your mother's side first, and then we'll put them together.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Clarice Hermia, H-E-R-M-I-A, Dreer Davis.
Speaker 1: Drear Davis, okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Oh my God, I don't remember, 1913 in October.  I think it was October the fifth, 1913, and she died in August of 2010, I believe--wait a minute, I don't remember the date that she died.
Speaker 1: And where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Litchfield, Virginia, and most of her life was in St. Louis, Missouri.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there a story behind her name?
Speaker 2: Hermia?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: My grandfather's name is Herman, and he was the one who selected the name, and so, that's the Hermia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side.  How far back can you trace them and what were they doing, what were their occupations and activities?
Speaker 2: My grandmother is interesting.  I know more about her father than I know about her mother.  Her--my grandfather was Herman Dreer, and he was born here in Washington, D.C., and his father was a runaway slave from, I don't remember which part of the South, that's where the name Dreer comes from.  And he--the story goes that he hit his master and he had to leave.  He came here and he drove ice--what is this Sterling oil--not drove, there was the horses going around the fuel trucks then and he was go around--so he had a really kind of decent job at that time.  And he must have done well.  There were my grandfather and I think three or four sisters.  And grandpa went to Dunbar High School [Washington, D.C.] and then graduated and went to Bowdoin College in [Brunswick] Maine, and-- Now, there's a story there, too, right?
Speaker 1: --Yes, it was.  He had a full ride.  He was--the story is that he was number two behind [John] Russwurm with a 100-year gap between them. The second black person to attend--
Speaker 2: Bowdoin College [Brunswick, Maine]. Bowdoin College, behind John Russwurm who was one of the founders of Freedom Journal.
Speaker 1: Exactly.  And grandpa majored in English and Chemistry, cause he couldn't decide what--we'd say a doctor, but he loved the spoken word.  He graduated magna cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa in three years.  So there was a library--we had a scholarship at one time that the family established to help (unclear) his students at Bowdoin College [Brunswick, Maine], and it was taken over by the Omega Psi Phi, cause Grandpa wrote the history for Omega Psi Phi, so any Que ought to know Herman Dreer, at least the first history of Omega Psi Phi Grandpa wrote.  My grandmother, I know only that she was in Lynchburg, Virginia, that's where they met at a seminary, and that they came to St. Louis, and there were two children, my mother Clarice and my aunt Vivian.  Grandpa was an educator, he decided.  He got a master's degree and a Ph.D. degree from the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  I think he has another master's degree.  But he was an educator, a principal, minister and civil rights kind of leader in St. Louis, Missouri.  My grandmother never worked outside of the home, but boy, did she--if she'd ever done it, she would have been a powerhouse.  My mother--you want to go to my father's [John Davis, Sr.] side.
Speaker 2: Well, not yet.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 117601
Speaker 1: Okay, so the family moves to St. Louis [Missouri] when your grandfather [Herman Dreer] moves to St. Louis [Missouri]?
Speaker 2: My grandfather moved everybody to St. Louis, and that's where, you know, he stayed and became an educator as I said and a minister.
Speaker 1: About what year?
Speaker 2: Oh, I have no idea.
Speaker 1: He had finished the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No.  The University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] actually came much later.  Grandpa was sixty-seven getting his Ph.D. degree.  He started it, and I don't remember now why he stopped, but part of it he said had something to do with he believed to be a racial issues at that time because every time he was up to defend his thesis, they would always disband for some reason.  So, you know--and then he would stop and whatever else, but he was sixty-seven when he finally got it all.  He had two masters in between all of that, but then he went on and did that and then he taught, not on a regular basis, but at all the colleges.  I'm not sure he did any in St. Louis, because that was such a--none of the big ones in St. Louis [Missouri], like St. Louis University [St. Louis, Missouri] and Washington University [St. Louis, Missouri], smaller ones at Harris Teacher's College [currently Harris-Stowe State University, St. Louis, Missouri], he taught there, but it would always hurt him in a way because he never had the opportunity to teach in any of these universities or was asked to teach in any of these universities and although he was well qualified to do so.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 117602
Speaker 1: Now, what neighborhood did your mother [Clarice Dreer Davis] grow up in?
Speaker 2: The Ville [St. Louis, Missouri].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, this is an area called the Ville, and we've heard about it before, [HM] Margaret Bush Wilson grew up there-
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And what are the boundaries of the Ville, what side of town?
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh, I don't even really know that.  That's embarrassing, because my mother and father [John Davis, Sr.] actually did an audio tape trying to get people on idea of what it was like to live in the Ville.  I know it was a great neighborhood for us.  I remember some aspects of it, because we lived there for a while, until I was about five or six, but I remember--we--I don't remember where she lived when she was young, but my grandfather [Herman Dreer] built this two-family flat on (unclear).  And across the street from us was Margaret Bush Wilson, and then Andrew Jackson who was the principal--assistant principal at Sumner and right next door was another assistant principal and then my relatives--I could cut through the back yard of one person's house and go visit my aunt who was on North Market and so the, oh, what is the name of the--Madam C. J. Walker had a big hotel around there, so it was quite, you know, it was a interesting neighborhood.  My mother told me about some of the dancers that were--and for the life of me, I can't remember this hotel's name right now.  I've got this book behind me--with St. Louis, I could pick it up and get it, but--and they would dance on the roof top and so forth.  So even though it was segregated, Sumner was down the street and all-- Sumner High School?
Speaker 1: --Sumner High School was a part of the Ville, and they--Addie Malone Orphan Home was there and they would have this orphan parade.  It would go through the neighborhood.  So it was rich and quite a number of activities and backgrounds and you got a whole kind of potpourri of people and goals and ambitions at the time.
Speaker 2: Your mother talked about the Ville-
Speaker 1: She and my dad, yeah, cause I know, like my father's family was over on Page.  Page must have been like the outer part of it.  I don't know how far over it extended, but then I had a great aunt that lived on North Market.  Everybody in my--and she was such a historian, Julia Davis.  I mean you drive down the street and she would say on this street so-and-so did this and so-and-so did that, so it was always competition between my aunt Julia as a historian on the Davis side of my family and my Grandpa Dreer, who was a historian on the Dreer side of the family, so it was really an interesting time.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, now did your mother go to Sumner [High School, St. Louis, Missouri]?
Speaker 1: Yes.  She and my dad both went to Sumner High School and graduated.  And my mother was, she says, the first black graduate of the University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] fine arts department.  Now, when she died they wrote a big obituary about--based on what I had written.  They couldn't find the information about her being the first--they didn't say whether she was or she wasn't, they couldn't find it.  The story behind it was that she--they wanted--the school wanted her to go into architecture, because there was a black already in architecture, and my grandfather said, no, says you're gonna go into the fine arts, and she did, and she graduated from there.  Then she and daddy later went on, I think, to the University of Iowa [Iowa City, Iowa] where they both got master's degree after that, so.  I don't remember dates, I wasn't around and all that, so.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So she went to the University of Pennsylvania?
Speaker 1: In Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, at Penn, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: All right.
Story_ID: 117603
Speaker 1: Now, let me go to your father's side.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: John Winfield Davis.
Speaker 1: Can you spell that?
Speaker 2: W-I-N-F-I-E-L-D and D-A-V-I-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: July, I think he's the 19th and he's 1913, I think that is right. Okay.  What do you know about his side of the family?
Speaker 1: Well, my brother's been doing the research on that, which is interesting.  We know--I know from my grandmother, his mother, Anna, that she was the product--her mother was the product of the--a slave and the slave owner.  And that she was--he actually wanted her to be educated, but she was so angry about him not freeing her that she refused to go into any formal education and she regretted it.  That's what my grandmother always said.  So that when her children were born, she insisted that all of them be educated.  And I think they went through what is the normal school.  I don't know how far up that went.
Speaker 2: That's almost like a two-year degree as a teaching degree?
Speaker 1: Exactly, exactly.  And my grandmother always said she wasn't sure--her father died when she was young, but she said, she thought he was an American Indian, cause they grew up--she grew up in Brownsville, Tennessee, I think it was.  And I always regret that I never sat down and got more information from her.  My brother was able to track her mother's back--and I think--you know it's my grandfather's mother back.  And her name was Davis Davis.  Isn't that a funny name, that she would have a double name like that.
Speaker 2: This is your grand?
Speaker 1: This is my--on my paternal grandfather's side.  His mother was named Davis.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And Davis.
Story_ID: 117604
Speaker 1: Papa Davis [Randolph-Jasmine's paternal grandfather] was a postal worker, and was that until the day he died.  He was also a lay minister and very active in the community.  The Pine Street YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association], he was one of the co-founders of Pine Street YMCA in St. Louis, Missouri.  They had four children-
Speaker 2: Was that the first black "Y"?
Speaker 1: --I think it was.
Speaker 2: Okay, the Pine Street "Y"?
Speaker 1: Pine Street.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And he--try to think of all of that.  He was a postal worker, a lay minister.  My--interestingly enough, my paternal grandmother [Davis Davis] lived to be 109 years old, and my grandfather's oldest sister lived to be 102.  These folks were hanging in here for a long time.  They were very active in the community.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right, so we were talking about your Papa Davis who founded the Pine Street Y?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.  He was one of the co-founders of it, and--
Speaker 2: Lay minister?
Speaker 1: --Lay minister at Central Baptist Church and the other grandfather was at Keensbury [ph]. Baptist Church.  The funny thing was when my paternal grandfather spoke at my maternal grandfather's church, my brother was like three years old or something, and Papa Davis said, "Won't you come forth and join the church?" and Allen jumped up and ran down the aisle, and he said Pop said come on up.  You know, everybody kind of laughed at that one, so.  But interesting time, both of them were involved in some way in civil rights.  My mother's [Clarice Dreer Davis] father more so than my father's father.  Herman Dreer, as I said, worked with [William] Bill Clay always credits grandpa, with helping him get started on his political career and also the demonstrations that were outside of the Jefferson Bank.  So as I said I don't think you could go through an educational institution in St. Louis, elementary through college, and not run into one of my relatives, which made it awful.  In fact I went in high school where my mother taught, and I couldn't pull anything without her knowing about it before the day was over, so.
Story_ID: 117605
Speaker 1: Now, your father, John Winfield Davis, he finished Sumner [High School, St. Louis, Missouri] too?
Speaker 2: He finished Sumner.  He went to the University of Illinois [at Champaign-Urbana, Urbana-Champaign, Illinois].  He was sixteen years old.  He and [HM] Wayman Smith--did you do anything on Wayman Smith, do you know who I'm talking about?
Speaker 1: Wayman Smith, yeah, he's the attorney in-
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --St. Louis we were talking about.  [HM] Wayman Smith whose--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Office was-
Speaker 2: Well, his dad and my dad were best friends.  And they rode up to the University of Illinois in Wayman's Model"T", that was the story.  And Daddy was--I think he majored in architecture, but he never went beyond--into that field at all.  He and mom [Clarice Dreer Davis] went up to the University of Iowa [Iowa City, Iowa], as I said, and he got a master's degree.  At that time was it was in manual arts, and that's what he taught when he was in--industrial arts is what it was called at that time.  And he taught, they both did, in St. Louis until the time they retired.
Speaker 1: Okay, so art and industrial arts?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So their whole career was spent in St. Louis [Missouri]?
Speaker 2: It's been in St. Louis, right, right.
Story_ID: 117606
Speaker 1: When you think about your parents' personalities, their dispositions, their sense of humor, what they were interested in, their talents, what they look like, what they walk like, who do you think you take after?
Speaker 2: I think when I was smaller I probably looked a lot like my dad [John Davis, Sr.].  I think the older I get, I think I am more like my mother [Clarice Dreer Davis].  And there are times now when I hear myself say something, I say, "Oh, my God, I've turned into my mom."  I have a little bit of my father's sense of humor and--'cause he was very droll, you know, he was a great story-teller.  I wish I had more of my mom's artistic background.  She was a great artist, very dramatic.  Let's see, what else would you ask me about that.  Yeah, I think now I'm a combination of them at this stage in my life.
Story_ID: 117607
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, do you have siblings?
Speaker 2: I do.  I have two brothers, John and Allen. It's interesting that we all had science backgrounds, 'cause we used to say, we probably got all that scientific information from my dad [John Davis, Sr.], which my mother [Clarice Dreer Davis] refutes, because she said I did something in science or whatever else.  But Allen worked for Boeing as an analyst, a mathematician or whatever until he retired and my other brother, John, was in St. Louis [Missouri], and he did, what was it, he had a specific name, he worked with quality--quality of air for the State of Missouri, so he would go around and--environmental.  He did things in water and air pollution, and he was a chemistry major.  So, we all picked up a science to come out with.  But they all retired, I'm the only one that is actually still working, you know.
Speaker 1: Are they older than you?
Speaker 2: I'm the oldest.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: These are your two younger brothers?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 117608
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Did I have what now?
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I do.  It didn't make much sense.  What I remember, I guess I had measles, 'cause I remember standing on top of the bathroom toilet and being wiped down with calamine lotion.  Now why that stands out in my mind, I don't know, but I remember that.  I remember, I must have been about maybe eight when my father's [John Davis, Sr.]--the sister next to him died, and she was my favorite aunt, I loved her dearly.  She was just gorgeous and she taught me to read when I was three.  And she had breast cancer, and I went--I remember brushing her hair.  And a funny story--you want a funny story.  When I was doing the show--we were doing this past life regression, and they asked me would I--would I go to this guy who was doing it, and see if he could hypnotize me and see if I could go back in time and whatever else.  And I--I was so convinced that I couldn't be hypnotized, but I said, oh, it's show business, you know, oh I'll do this.  So I go and I remembered the wall paper that was on my aunt's bedroom.  I could describe it perfectly and the furniture that was in it.  And I must have been, I don't know, four or five, maybe younger than that.  That I got.  I couldn't get too much beyond that, you know that kind of thing.  But I remember when she died that my grandfather [Papa Davis] wanted to take me to the funeral.  And we all went and I remember him leaning over and kissing her goodbye.  And I must have been--I mean that stayed with me for quite a while after that, well, obviously now, so.
Story_ID: 117609
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, you grew up--what neighborhood did you grow up in?
Speaker 2: Not in St. Louis [Missouri].  We moved out into the suburban area.  My grandfather bought a house out there.  We all moved as a family.  Again, I--whew--we just sold the house.  We all said we'd been in it at least sixty years.  When we moved out to it, it was an unincorporated area that further down the street was University City [Missouri], but the street we were on was the--all the blacks lived on that one block.  And University City, I guess, wasn't claiming us at the time.  But it was a great block.  Down the street from us was Mr. Haynes who taught Arthur Ash.  And across the street from us was, I can't think of his last name, Mr. Walton, I can think of his first name, who taught me music and his house before that was owned by a fox who was in the state department.  Now how many black folks do you know would have been in the state department back then?  But it was a great neighborhood.  We didn't go to school there.  We went to school in St. Louis [Missouri], but it was a great neighborhood in terms of there were still apple trees and plum trees and pear trees in my yard and you know grape orchard.  And so, but at one point my grandmother and my mother [Clarice Dreer Davis] decided two women under the roof top couldn't make.  So we bought--my family bought the house from my grandfather, so we stayed out there, and I grew up in that area.
Speaker 1: Where did your grandmother go?
Speaker 2: My grandparents moved back into the city proper.
Speaker 1: Your grandparents moved back to the city in the same house?
Speaker 2: In the same house, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We were all out there initially in the same house, and then they bought out and then they went back--we bought the house--my parents bought the house and then they went back into the city.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So was the house like a ranch style?
Speaker 2: Uh-uh [No].  It's a big old house.  It's a big old drafty house, which we loved.  I got kind of sentimental when we sold it, just this year, cause the neighborhood had gone down so drastically that it was hard to sell, but it had about a half an acre of yard around it, and I think it was--it had to be at least over a hundred and something years old and--but you know loved that house dearly, had a lot of good times in the house.
Speaker 1: What was the neighborhood eventually called?
Speaker 2: It's called now Pagedale [Missouri], and it--yeah, it's Pagedale now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  P-A-G-E-D-A-L-E?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Story_ID: 117610
Speaker 1: Now we always ask this question, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: The smells would always be coffee in the morning and my room was right over the kitchen, so I could smell the coffee when my mother [Clarice Dreer Davis] would do the coffee and bacon and whatever in the morning, cause she insisted on all of us having a full breakfast before we would go out to school and whatever else.  To this day I can't eat a full breakfast and move, you know, I do lighter breakfastses [sic].  The sights, you know in St. Louis [Missouri], this is, this is--they used to have this fountain in Forest Park that would change colors on it.  And I don't know, people today, when they look at all the things that are on television now, the very idea that you could get in a family car and go to Forest Park and watch a fountain change color as a big deal, but that was something I loved to do.  Sounds, as a teenager I belonged to the Hi-Y Club, and they were trying at the time to get all of us interested in the history of black music and jazz and so forth.  So I used to have a pretty good collection of jazz records that somehow got lost when I went off to college, but I mean, you know, Charlie Parker and I mean, you know, just really good stuff.  So it's kind of a hodgepodge of different kinds of things.  Smells, I remember my mother and my aunt were great cooks and my grandmother, and we had these grapes growing in the yard, and they would make jam.  I never had store-bought jam until I came here [Washington, D.C.] more or less, 'cause they would make it every year, so some of my memories.
Story_ID: 116810
Speaker 1: You started school early, right?
Speaker 2: I started elementary school at four and graduated from high school when I was sixteen.
Speaker 1: So you had an aunt that taught you how to read?
Speaker 2: She did, she did.
Speaker 1: Now, what was her name?
Speaker 2: Helen.
Speaker 1: Aunt Helen.
Speaker 2: My Aunt Helen, yeah.  She taught me to read.
Speaker 1: She was your mother's [Clarice Dreer Davis] sister?
Speaker 2: My father's [John Davis, Sr.], yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Your father's sister.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  She was the second--he was the youngest and she was next to him.  Gorgeous woman, very glamorous, you know, and--I mean I--we were the only grandchildren and the only niece and nephew for a long time, so we were absolutely spoiled, you know, that kind of thing, but not rotten, but just spoiled, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So you learned how to read at four.  But how did they manage to get you admitted to school?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess--I don't know how they did it to tell you the truth.  I started in--in like a half a day or something like that and then they just you know--next thing I knew, I was going to school and never--it's interesting now cause a lot of parents will say, you know, the kids are not mature enough or whatever else.  If that was an issue, I never knew about it.  So, you know, I just had--and then like, I think, my brother next to me was always--he could put anything that you put in front of him together, a clock or anything like that was broken, he could figure out how to put all those things together, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now you started kindergarten at four?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were probably ahead of the--most five year olds, when they start kindergarten, can't read.
Speaker 2: I know, I know.  I volunteer up my high--the grade school around here and the kids are in kindergarten, many can but a lot of them--which is why I say, you know, if you could start kids reading earlier, cause I have still a love of books that, that, you know I go back and say it started when I was in, you know, four years old or younger, whatever, yeah.
Story_ID: 116811
Speaker 1: Okay.  So well, tell us about school, did you have a--now you went to-
Speaker 2: Riddick.
Speaker 1: Riddick, okay.  That's R-I-D-
Speaker 2: R-I-D-D-I-C-K.
Speaker 1: Okay, elementary.  And were you interested in any particular subject at that level?
Speaker 2: Not really.  But I tell you my favorite teacher there was Miss Cooper, B. Cooper, who was my eighth grade teacher.  I think she was my seventh and eighth grade, I think she kept us.  And she did something that, to this day, we had to do a black history note book, and we started it in September.  So it wasn't like the month of February.  We started it in September and completed it by the end of the year.  And you know that time teachers taught everything.  So-
Speaker 1: What you described, I just want to say this for anybody watching this.  People don't understand that when [Carter G.] Woodson founded Black History Month, or Negro History Week, rather, he founded it as a time to show off projects you worked on the entire year.  A lot of people think that's the only time we're supposed to celebrate, because that week's the time to celebrate it, I mean the time to do the research, but he encouraged the research to be done ahead of time, so it would be like a science fair.  Negro History Week would be the time when you would show your projects off.
Speaker 2: He in fact, Carter G. Woodson and my grandfather were friends, so you know, they both were historians at that time, but you know, grandpa did not have the same kind of visibility, if you will, that Carter G. Woodson had.  But he would stress that history, so.  But I remember Miss Cooper with that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she knew what to do?
Speaker 2: She did, she did.  And we did, so.
Speaker 1: Do you remember your project?
Speaker 2: I had a lot of different--it was just collecting names and information about them and a wide variety of who these individuals were, that kind of thing, so.
Speaker 1: Now this is in mid-'50s [1950s] right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: This was before the big black history-
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --awareness of the late '60s [1960s] took place?
Story_ID: 116812
Speaker 1: Listen, and when I got to high school, I had this teacher, what was his name, I can't even think of his name now.  It'll come to me.  And he taught social science, and he would stand up there, big guy.  He would say, "The boys stood on the burning deck and eating peanuts by the peck, the flames grew high, he would not go, because he loved his peanuts so."  And we would always wonder why is he telling us this story?  And he said, "It got your attention."  But he was the one who asked us to do inventions.  And I'll always remember this cause the paper, you'd have to have margins on the side, and he'd march--you know, mark them off.  And if you didn't have the right margin, he would not even look at the content of it, he would just snatch, you know, go right on through it.  And he'd ask us to turn in 500 inventions.  I thought I'd be really smart and I turned in 750.  So then came time to be graded and he said, I think his name was Mr. Woodson, tell you the truth.  But it came time to be graded, and everybody who did what he said with the 550 got a "C".  I turned in my 750 and I got a "B" plus.  I said well that's not fair, you asked for 750 and I went over it.  He said but she, pointing to another student, Doris Williams, if I can remember that, he said she turned in a thousand.  And he said, so he asked me, he said, "Could you have gone on?"  I said, yes.  He said but you didn't, and she did.  And I thought, harsh lesson, but one that has stayed with me all my, you know, all this time, so.  So I later learned those are wonderful stories to walk out your educational institution with, you know.  Kids these days, I don't know whether they get that same kind of, you know, you can do this, but if you do more, and it isn't always fair, but maybe it's all because you haven't done all you could do, so.

Speaker 1: Okay, so, now did you like math?
Speaker 2: Well, I was a--what do they call it?  I was--they didn't track then but I was a--a college bound student.  I've forgotten the term they used then.  So I had to take algebra, geometry, I think trigonometry.
Speaker 1: Now that's in high school, right?
Speaker 2: That's in high school.
Speaker 1: On the grade school level?
Speaker 2: I had it all, I mean-
Speaker 1: Were you thinking about becoming a doctor-
Speaker 2: --No.
Speaker 1: --When you were a little kid?
Speaker 2: --I wasn't thinking anything about that.  I mean I used to sit in the kitchen with my mom [Clarice Dreer Davis] while she was cooking and draw.  I used to be a pretty decent artist at one time.  I think I've lost it.  And I don't' even think I thought about that.  And I was a reader, like when my mother would take us up to the library, and I would come out with just tons of books, tons of books.  And when I would run out of books, I would write my own stories and illustrate them.  And so I don't know what I thought I was gonna do at that time.  I just hadn't firmed it up.  And when I got into high school, I was talking about being a psychologist.  You know everybody was going to be a psychologist.
Speaker 1: What do you think the influence was?
Speaker 2: For psychology?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I just--cause I didn't know anything about it, and I just thought probably it was, you know, the mind and you're thinking about people and so forth.  And then everybody--when I hit high school, everybody wanted me--all the women at least wanted me to be a doctor, you know.  I don't know what my father would've thought about it.  And they would say things like, you can be going to be a psychiatrist and whatever else.  So I don't really know if I thought about with any real focus what I wanted to do and be. Now Riddick, was that predominantly black?
Speaker 1: It was all black.
Speaker 2: All black, okay.
Speaker 1: All the schools were segregated then.
Speaker 2: I assumed so but I didn't want--because it was in the suburbs, away from the inner city, I didn't want to assume that.
Speaker 1: No.  All the schools were segregated.
Speaker 2: And Sumner, of course-
Speaker 1: Segregated.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Now were there any female doctors in town?
Speaker 1: Well, it's interesting, I didn't have any, but my biology teacher had a Ph.D. in biology and was a woman, Dr. Williams.  And another funny story.  Now here I am in biology and I used to be deathly afraid of caterpillars and all the rest of that stuff, and she announced that we were going to dissect frogs the next day or whatever.  So I told my mother--worms, that's what it was, we were going to dissect worms.  So I told my mother, I said "Dr. Williams said we had to go bring in rubber gloves."  She hadn't said that.  And somewhere in the day time, because my mother taught in the same school with her, she ran into Dr. Williams and she said, oh Carol told us to, you know, get these rubber gloves.  She doesn't need those gloves.  But I didn't know they had communicated.  So all that evening I'm just bugging my father, we got to go get these gloves, got to get these gloves, and then I finally made up my mind, okay, I won't worry about it, I'll just, you know, I didn't get em, I'll go in the back of the room and blah, blah.  Got in the class room and she said, "Carol, would you come up here."  I go up to the front of the room, she said, "Would you pass the worms out please?" which meant I had to put my hand in there and give them out.  Well, I got over that one real quick, you know, but she was a brilliant woman and a great teacher.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Not a cool thing to do.
Speaker 1: She got me, yeah.
Speaker 2: You were so clever in trying to figure out a way not to--to avoid touching those worms.
Speaker 1: I had worked that through.  I said I'm going to stay in the back of the room, she won't see me, blah.  It didn't work.
Story_ID: 116814
Speaker 1: So is this the--this is where you were in the Hi-Way Club?
Speaker 2: When I was in high school, I was--
Speaker 1: Hi-Y, Hi-Y.
Speaker 2: Hi-Y, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: I don't know why I have Hi-Way down here.  The Hi-Y Club is a jazz-
Speaker 2: It was part of the YWC--YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association].  And one of the things--there was a disc jockey there, Spider Burkes, and he had started this program for trying to get students, high school students, knowledgeable about our music from Bessie Smith and beyond, all the way up to where we are today.  And he did a very good job of it.  I think most of the people who I--I still, you know, talk to or whatever else who were in that group have a really, you know, great understanding and appreciation of a wide variety of music.
Speaker 1: Did St. Louis [Missouri] have a thriving entertainment area for black people when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  You know, you had--first of all the "Y" Circus, I think it was called, would come through the city and performed down at Kiel's auditorium.  So you would have people like Billy Eckstein and Joe Williams.  And then across the river [Mississippi River] was where I wasn't supposed to be with--East St. Louis [Illinois] with all those jazz clubs over there with great musicians.  Some of them were famous, some of them were not well known, but great music, and because a lot of places you couldn't go because of segregation, things were in people's homes or in places like different lodge clubs and so forth and so it didn't cost a lot of money and the parents would say, the kids can go with us.  And so we got a chance to hear a lot of good, you know, people and see a lot of performances in the home, so.
Speaker 1: Was there a major theater?
Speaker 2: There were several movie theaters, but they didn't do--there was none like Howard-
Speaker 1: Like the Howard Theater [Washington, D.C.]-
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --Or the Regal in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No.  We didn't have anything like that at that time, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It's interesting that St. Louis [Missouri] wouldn't. You would think they probably would.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it still troubles me where my city is right even today because it's not as advanced in some of the issues of civil rights as I would like to see it.  You can drive through central parts of St. Louis [Missouri] today and I mean it is like a bombed out area, you know.  But around the outskirts of it or whatever else it's fine.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So you grew to appreciate jazz through the Hi-Y, right?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: Did you like other popular music?
Speaker 2: I did, I mean I liked it all, you know, that kind of thing.  And my mother would insist on bringing all the classical music.  And my grandfather insisted that I would go when I was a little girl, I remember this, you talk about childhood memories, I remember wearing a straw hat with little cherries on it going to see the opera 'Aida.'  My grandfather wanted me to go.  We had to sit way up in the crow's nest 'cause that's where black folks sat.  And he wanted me to see it because it was a black--it was about a woman, you know, in Africa.  And in the performance was Janet Colliers who was the black ballerina at the time.  Now that's something I wanted, I thought I might want to do was to dance.  I did ballet and all the rest of that kind of stuff.  That was okay but not great.  But I remember going with my grandfather, and to see that 'Aida,' that opera at that time, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 116815
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's something.  So you have a lot of cultural influences around you (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Oh, and with Kenneth Billups who had our--our high school choir produced Grace Bumbry, and she would sing at our, you know, at our assemblies.  So we had the rich, you know--there was nothing, you know, they say separate but equal, I think we exceeded that in many ways.  Most of my teachers were, you know, had master's degrees from great places and, you know, trying to push us ahead, so.
Speaker 1: I've heard that St. Louis [Missouri] teachers were some of the best educated black teachers in the black schools.  So were you involved in high school activities?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My mom [Clarice Dreer Davis] wouldn't let me be a cheerleader, 'cause she went to one game and somebody through a soda bottle and hit somebody and then that was it for her.  But I was in the dance troop, and so we danced to a lot of stuff, we were in the assemblies and so forth.
Speaker 1: Modern dance?
Speaker 2: Modern dance.  And we danced to James Weldon Johnson's the Creation, you know when God stepped out on space and we were doing our bit.
Speaker 1: Was there a [HM] Katherine Dunham influence?
Speaker 2: Some.
Speaker 1: Since she was from-
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Cleotha Spotts [ph.] was our instructor, and she had a--you know she would work with the "Y" Circus, what they called the "Y" Circus when it would come through and whatever, but--and Katherine Dunham was across the, you know, in Illinois.  And--but I just liked dancing.  I preferred that over gym cause don't give me a ball, I can't do anything with it, baseball, basketball, whatever.  If they allowed me to take dance instead of gym, I took dance, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you run for student government?
Speaker 2: I did, Student Council and I also was in the Human Relations Club, which was at that time we were working with the National Council--was it Christians--Christians and Jews and they had a teen program, and we used to meet up at Washington University [St. Louis, Missouri] and talk about what it would be like if we had--for integration, more or less, things--to talk about our differences, our common ground and whatever else.  It was a wonderful experience.  And through my church, I also got a chance to go to some of these integrated schools.  And my grandfather insisted when I was in high school, I wrote this paper for the Kiwanis Club, they had a contest and the winner got sent to this Camp Miniwanca in Michigan.  It's still in existence, wonderful, wonderful experience.  Again, some of the things I learned throughout my life, I learned at that camp.  So human relations, student council, the Hi-Y Club, the dance club, what else did I do, can't remember anymore, but those were just some of them anyway.
Speaker 1: So you were really active?
Speaker 2: I was active, I was very active.
Speaker 1: So--
Story_ID: 116816
Speaker 1: And you wanted to be a doctor?  When did you-
Speaker 2: I didn't want to be a doc--I mean, they kept saying that 'cause at that time, you know, there was like doctor, lawyer or teacher, you know that kind of thing.  We didn't think about many other fields beyond that.  I probably wasn't until I got to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] that I got serious about it, cause I thought I was going to be-- going--a psych major.  I tell you I had no focus and I got into a biology class and I just loved it, and I just thought, I can do this, you know, so.
Speaker 1: Was there any reason why you wanted to be a psychologist, I mean was there-
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --Some kind of reference in movies or TV or something (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: I can't even tell you why.  Why didn't I want to be a writer, I was doing that as a child, you know, but I-
Speaker 1: --Kenneth Clark, were you aware of his psychological studies of black children and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: No, uh-uh.  No not then, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I mean if you look at the things that held my interest, they were books, writing and illustration.  So why didn't I do that?  I don't know--and certainly television was never on the horizon, at all, you know, that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: So did you watch TV when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but not like we do today.  You know, I mean it was truly the family kind of situation where we'd sit around--"I Love Lucy" you know, that kind of thing, and you know it was not an all day, all night kind of thing.  My aunt [Vivian Dreer] used to love, when I'd go over to my grandparents' house, Kate Smith, you know, "[When the] Moon Comes Over [the Mountain]" and that kind of thing, "Howdy Doody" right, right, those kind of--but I mean it wasn't something where you had to race right in and sit down.  I played outside a lot, I used my imagination, we played, you know, what was it, cowboys and Indian, had a bicycle club, but we weren't really connected to television the way kids are now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you remember your first black television host that you saw on TV?  I know there were a couple of shows in that era.
Speaker 2: Not any that I saw as a kid.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not any that I saw at all.  I think-
Speaker 1: I'm a little older than you, maybe--I mean, younger rather.  The Nat King Cole show?
Speaker 2: Oh, I saw that, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, for a brief period of time.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Was that '59 [1959] or '60 [1960]?
Speaker 2: I don't remember when that was.
Speaker 1: That would have been when you were coming out of high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  And when I was in college, I didn't pay any attention to television at all, I mean, how could I, you know, that kind of thing, but--
Speaker 1: I don't even know if there were public affairs shows on TV, I guess Edward R. Murrow.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but he wasn't really--I mean he was a popular show, you know, that kind of thing.  And when he would go into people's houses, you know--with it.  But what I do remember was like with radio when Joe Louis--I don't know how old I was with this one.  I was over somebody's house and he was fighting somebody, you know, and they had the radio on.  I didn't even know what it was, but I remember the reaction from everybody who was listening when he won.  And it was the same way with Jackie Robinson when, you know, that kind of thing, cause I never saw him, but they would bring radio--teachers would bring in radio for--with the World Series, 'cause the Cardinals used to always, you know, they were a pretty good team, you know, that kind of thing, so.  I can't say I was interested but I heard it, you know.
Story_ID: 116817
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So as--by the time you were a senior, how did you choose your college?
Speaker 2: Primarily because they allowed me to go in January.  I had--my mother [Clarice Dreer Davis] wanted me to go to Lindenwood College [St. Charles, Missouri], and that was an all-girl school in Missouri.  And they--I would have been the first black student going in.  And we met up with the president, I remember that, and it was very much like a Hollywood production with the fire and the fireplace and the leather and all that kind of stuff.  And I walked out of there and I told my mother, I said, I will be number two, but I'm not going to be number one.  And she said, "What, why, why?"  I said I'm not going to carry the race on my back.  I want to do college and all the rest, but I don't want people to think this is the way all of us are and whatever else, I don't want that kind of responsibility.  She had also wanted me to go to Wheaton College [Norton, Massachusetts] which was up in Massachusetts and there was also Antioch College [Yellow Springs, Ohio].  Then I found out a girl friend of mine who we were always in competition, she was going, so I said, I don't want to go there.  So my aunt had graduated from Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee], and she said it was a very good school, and it was at that time.  It's not as good as it was then.  And when I--I told them that if I didn't go away to college in January, I would have had to go to the college in St. Louis [Missouri].  Well, my grandfather was there.  And I said I'm tired of going to school where my relatives are.  And Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] said we'll take her.  And they gave me a scholarship and off I went.
Speaker 1: Now had your aunt gone to Fisk?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  She graduated from Fisk.
Speaker 1: Was this your favorite aunt?
Speaker 2: No, she died.  She died when I was young.  But this is my mother's sister.  She another favorite aunt, though, I mean, if you talk about Auntie Mame, that was my Aunt Vivian, very dramatic, flowing gowns, very poetic, who also produced a program for Langston Hughes, if you didn't know.  He had a radio program in Cleveland at the time, I think it was.  And she produced some of his radio shows.  In fact, I have a book that he autographed for her. So this is Vivian-
Speaker 1: Vivian Dreer.
Speaker 2: Dreer, okay.  Gee whiz, okay.  Produced Langston Hughes' radio show.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.  I didn't know that either.
Speaker 2: This is something I've never heard.  When was his regular show on?
Speaker 1: Oh, gosh, it might have been in the '40s [1940s].  I don't know.  I'd have to go up and look at the book that he signed for her, but I think she wasn't the--I think she was like associate producer or whatever else, but you know, she did it, you know, and--but very dramatic.
Speaker 2: St. Louis [Missouri] is a place a lot of things come out-
Speaker 1: I know.  So you know, why didn't I say I wanted to be a writer or something, you know, that kind of thing, but I didn't.
Speaker 2: --Okay.  So Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee], this is 1958, right?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: So you graduated from high school in '58 [1958]?
Speaker 1: And then-
Speaker 2: Went on to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee]?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Now who's this, Charles Johnson, was he the president?
Speaker 1: No, he wasn't.  Oh gosh, Stephen Wright.  Johnson had died.  And I never got a chance to meet him, but I understood he was much loved by the student body and the faculty.  But he died before I got on campus, and Stephen Wright was the new president at that time.
Speaker 2: Your aunt had been there under Charles (simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: Yeah, she'd been there.
Speaker 2: --Charles Spurgeon Johnson.
Speaker 1: Yeah, she--I don't even know who was the president when she was there, but you know.
Story_ID: 116818
Speaker 1: Fisk was--well what was it like?  Just tell us what it was like to you?
Speaker 2: It was--Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] was like--how do I describe it?  It was, for me, it was the first time on my own, you know, without family around, educationally challenging.  I used to hang around the International Students Union.  I loved going there cause we'd always sit around there trying you know pretend like we were smarter than we were.  Great teachers, lots of fun, lot of people who had--some with ideas of what they wanted to do, most of them, like myself, who didn't.  And then the Civil Rights Movement came in, changed quite a bit of it, more focus, lot of very brave people who were there, [HM] Marion Barry, Diane Nash, marches that were going on.  I remember I met a minister up at that same camp that I told you about, Camp Miniwanca, who, when I was in high school, who was a big minister down in Nashville [Tennessee], and I was so impressed with him up at the camp that I wanted to go to his church in Nashville, and I remember going down there.  I can't even think of his name now.  I think I blocked it out intentionally.  But for all his bravado up there in Michigan, I could not go to his church in Nashville.  He did not have it opened.  But that I think put a lot of more the seriousness of, if you will, the determination.  There is about our youth there, their ability to see an issue and move forth, fearlessly in some ways, that came on to my time down there, the latter part of it.  I also got married in my junior year, which kind of took me off campus, well not kind of, it did take me off campus, and-
Speaker 1: Now, who were some of your--well, did you pledge in your first two years?
Speaker 2: I did.  I pledged AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority], and my mother [Clarice Dreer Davis] and my aunt [Vivian Dreer] came down to pin me, and they were both AKAs.  So I had no choice.  You know I was going to be an AKA, and--I was going to tell you, I had a ball down there, you know, that kind of thing.  I joined the Ushers Club, I was on the student council down there, a head of my line when we pledged AKA.  And then because I married, I moved off campus a lot of that went by the way.
Speaker 1: Well, let's ask you about some of the professors there, now you were taken--you majored in biology?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, not just the science teachers, but who were some of your favorite (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Well, [HM Samuel] Massie.  I can't think of Dr. Massie's first name.
Speaker 1: --Dr. Samuel Massie?
Speaker 2: Yes. Okay.
Speaker 1: He was my chemistry professor, who also told my then to be husband to leave me alone because I was such a serious student.  He didn't need to mess around with me was the way he put it.  Dr. Maxwell was my biology teacher.  Another Dr. Williams was my botany teacher, who I loved, Dr. Collins was my English instructor.  I remember him saying to me once, "Carol, is there a minister in your family?" and I said, "Yes, I have two, why?"  He says, cause you write like one.  And I thought I wasn't sure whether he meant it as a compliment or not.  But those are some of my favorite instructors.  Then I had art from oh, gosh, Aaron-
Speaker 2: Aaron Douglas?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: The great Aaron Douglas.
Speaker 1: I took one course from him and I really did something that I was very proud of and he liked it.  And I don't have it to this day.  I don't know, you know, he kept it.  But I, you know, you had to take an art class or whatever else and I took that with him and he was wonderful.  That was the way I used to make some money down there at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee], I could do these biology drawings.  And a lot of the guys over at Meharry wanted to somebody to draw their psychology and histology drawings for them.  It was the same thing year after year, you just had to chance, you know, port it from one notebook into the other, and I did.  So I was very good at doing those kinds of things.  And I would draw things for entomology and all the rest of it.  Couldn't do it now, I don't think, if my life depended on it, but I took that course with Aaron Douglas and loved it.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] sounds like a rich experience.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now as you were leaving, they were doing the sit-ins, I mean, the Freedom Rides, sit-ins and other things?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 116020
Speaker 1: So you got married.  So I assume you and your husband met in class (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We met at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee].  He was a pre-med major also.  And he was older and I think I, you know, I don't know whether his maturity or whatever else, but at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] at that time, if you got to your senior year and you weren't pinned or have an engagement ring or whatever else, it was kind of like, "Oh my God what are you doing next?"  It seems so silly now when I look at it.  We had a whole page in our year book called "The Brides" or "The Brides To Be" and they were all sitting around in their gowns and whatever else, so.  It was, you know, I got married, and my senior year, I was a married student living off campus.
Speaker 1: Looking back on it now, I mean, you're reflecting on it, but what were they telling young black women about their future.  You know I've often heard people say that the women would go to college and the instructions would be to find you a man and all this sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Well I'll tell you-
Speaker 1: You're a really bright person in school, and-
Speaker 2: --I used to say this stopped me from going to medical school, which I now know is not true, cause if I think if I really wanted to do it, I would have done it, but the teacher who was ahead of the Biology Department had put me into a lot of advance courses with seniors and so forth.  And in my senior year, he said, now what are you going to do?  And I said, well, I'm going to go to medical school, and he said, I was married then, and he said, "why Darling," he was a very southern gentleman, "why don't you just go on home and have some babies," you know.  And that just broke my heart.  And I thought, you know, I used to say to myself, oh, he said that to me, broke my spirit or whatever else, and I don't think my father [John Davis, Sr.] really saw me being a doctor at some point or whatever.  But his views would subsequently change about what I was involved in.  But we were--my mother [Clarice Dreer Davis], though, was always on me about, you can do whatever you want to do, you can be whatever you want to be and that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Now was this chairman an African American?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Was this an African American?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: At Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee].  Yes, yes.  He did, you know, he--
Speaker 1: I know all the teachers weren't black.
Speaker 2: --No, they weren't.  But, but--and what I couldn't reconcile was that he pushed me into some really tough courses where I might have been a sophomore with some seniors, you know, who had better backgrounds in science or whatever else.  And sometimes I was struggling.  And I thought well, why would he do that if he also thought I couldn't or shouldn't go into medical school.  And I used to use that as you know, as an excuse, well, I'm not a doctor now, today and whatever else.  And then finally one day I said this is ridiculous, cause if you really had wanted to go ahead and do this in spite of the fact that my then husband had said if you're gonna go the marriage is through and blah, blah, blah, crazy stuff that you know, in terms of my wife does this and blah, blah, blah.  But we were kind of raised to be like Ruth and follow, you know, to some extent.
Speaker 1: I think people should bear in mind you're two years younger than what you should be in school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You're two years younger than your peers.
Speaker 2: I was.  That's true.
Speaker 1: And here you got a leadership position in the AKAs [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority] and the student council, you know you're really--
Speaker 2: I hadn't thought about it like that.
Speaker 1: --married an older guy tellin' you that you shouldn't--and the chairman tells you shouldn't do this.  You obviously had the talent or you wouldn't be able to keep up.
Story_ID: 116021
Speaker 1: It--you know, but the pieces don't always fall together for you.  It's kind of like all of a sudden you wake up and you say, I got this, but you don't realize what you passed up in the meantime.  I think that if I--I have a niece now who is a doctor, she's a psychiatrist, and that was what I always--my mom [Clarice Dreer Davis] always wanted me to do and play aunt wanted me to do and whatever else.  But I--you know I look at her and how she's doing and whatever else and she's doing fine, she's great, you know.  But--and I think at one point I thought about medicine because my aunt, the favorite aunt, had died of breast cancer and I wanted to do something along those lines.  But I didn't have that internal fire to push me.
Speaker 2: It's an interesting thing that you might not have wanted to be a doctor as much it sounds like the women around you wanted you to be a doctor.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But, if I may, a lot of people we interview, you know, choose to be a doctor or their people push them to be a doctor because it's seen in the black community as being the highest attainment.  But we really don't know about a lot of other fields you can be involved in in science and such.  But it's seen as the highest attainment as a doctor.
Speaker 1: Doctor, lawyer or teacher, that's what you saw.  And the bottom in terms of money was the teaching aspect of it, but you usually had a lot of degrees to tack onto it to push you up into you know whatever else, so, yeah. I think still in the community today, people see a doctor as highest level of achievement.
Speaker 2: It is.  Well, it's changing, because you make a lot more money as a lawyer in many instances, not all, but in some of those.  And they've got a lot more kind of (unclear) days, they've got a lot of things that they can do and be, you know, that we didn't even think about.  I think it's wonderful.  But you know I really wondered what if somebody would have said to me, "Carol, sit down and write," you know, really do the English and you know, learn the writing and whatever else.  I like to think I would have written a best seller or whatever else.  I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Was Arnold (unclear) there?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, but I never had any courses with him, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did you ever meet James Lawson and some of the others?
Speaker 2: Oh, I had physics with him.  Now ask me what I know about physics, you know, and that kind of thing cause we later said there ought to be a physics for biology majors and they have since switched to do that cause you know when I was in high school, physics went right on by me.  I can't see sound traveling, light traveling, all these other things.  You give me a formula, I can do it, but I can't get the concept, which used to drive me crazy because my brother who was younger understood it perfectly.  In fact he and my dad [John Davis, Sr.] it, you know, could do it, you know, the homework and whatever else and try to explain it to me that I never got, but he was there.
Story_ID: 116022
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So you graduate from school like--as you're married, right, but you didn't--weren't able to go to medical school?
Speaker 2: No, I stayed--I was a year ahead of him and I stayed and actually taught.  I was a graduate assistant in the biology department, and I worked with comparative anatomy and all.  That was the greatest experience cause I got the chance to set up all these animals.  Remember the story about the worms and so forth?  Now I'm setting out all these cats and whatever for people to look at.  But I worked there for a year at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee], and then we moved to St. Louis [Missouri] after that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this is when you hear about this NSF Scholarship, National Science Foundation?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I didn't know about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I walked into--one of the things--I had time on my hands and again, I'm focused.  My husband was then working at Monsanto, and I walked into Washington University just to take a couple of courses and the person who was there was advisor as well as the one who's connected to the National Science Foundation grant and he said what are your grades, and he says I got this one scholarship available 'cause the student had to cancel, it paid your tuition, it gave you a stipend, and I walked into it.
Speaker 1: So this is for a master's degree in science education?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Cause education had to be part of what that was all about. Okay, well tell us about that experience?
Speaker 1: Well, it was good and it was bad.  First of all, I leave Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] and I'm going to Washington University [St. Louis, Missouri].  Here's this huge lab and I've never worked with live animals before in my life.  And we're in there and we're now going to start doing lab work on mice and rats.  I think, what on earth am I supposed to do with this.  We had a funny one where one of my classmates who is also black, cause there were not many of us in this program, and she opened up the cage and the mice went all over, you know, over the place and the teacher was like, oh my God.  But I think I ran into my first real bout of racism from a--and what can hurt so much was this guy was a great, great teacher.  And my first exam there, you know, he--I was pregnant then and I didn't realize I was pregnant.  It was early, early stages, and I would falling asleep.  So I'm writing and I didn't know what was going on.  And the first exam that I took there, I think I made about like a 68 or 70, something like that.  And he said that's good for you.  And I thought is he saying to me that this 70 is good for me.  He doesn't know what I can do.  And then I was irate.  And then the next time that he gave an exam, I made a 96, he'd taken two points off my paper because I referred to one of the professors in the research as a "he" and it was a woman.  And I went back to all the literature and I--the person's name was like H.S. or something like that, but never enough to give you an idea what the gender was.  And I thought if I could just get through this.  You know, that was my first encounter.
Story_ID: 116023
Speaker 1: But what really hurts so much was, this was a teacher who was good at what he did, teaching.  And I admired him so much and then to have these kind of incidents.  Then I had another one, just as I was getting ready to get out.  I was taking this apprenticeship program teaching.  And it was a summer school program.  And the teacher, it was in a high school in Clayton, Missouri, it was a very wealthy suburb.  And these kids had more stuff in there than I had ever seen even down at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee].  And when I got a chance to teach there, she says to me, you're one of the best apprentices that I've ever worked with.  She said that, but then this professor comes in here and he says to me, the one from Washington University [St. Louis, Missouri] comes in to look at me, and he gets me--I needed, I think, an "A" to come out of there with what I needed to get, not a "B" plus, but an "A", and he said I'm going to give you a "B" plus because I want you to take another course from me. And I didn't under--you know, I didn't know why, he had never seen me but that one time and this woman had worked with me and thought that I should not only have gotten an "A" but even a higher grade than that.  So it left me with an awful taste in my mouth about Washington University.  Still to this day, I get material from them and whatever else, but I'm not over it.  I still carry that one around with me, so. How many black students were actually on campus, do you think?
Speaker 2: Well, none were getting a master's in biology, I don't think we had any.  This other girl and I were the, I think, the first one or two to be working in this science education.  There were people in the law school.  It's a beautiful campus, if you've ever been up--and a big one, you know, that kind of thing, with a lot of money behind it.  But we were kind of--I don't think I was the first in any of this, but we were among the very few in that department, you know, trying to get through, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was there any sort of--now this would have been from '58 [1958] to--
Speaker 2: No, that would have been '60 [1960], '62 [1962] through '65 [1965], I think would have coming out, yeah.
Story_ID: 116024
Speaker 1: So you were there during the time of the March on Washington [1963] and the Kennedy [President John F. Kennedy] assassination?
Speaker 2: I just--yes.  And in fact I came up here to the first March on Washington and could almost--I used to point to tell my daughter all that time, see that tree, that was where I was standing, there you know, cause my then mother-in-law lived in Richmond [Virginia] and we came up on a bus and the bus--I remember the bus driver--somebody had their radio on, they would say, well, we're not getting the crowd that we expected to get, blah, blah, blah, and the mood on the bus was like, you know, everybody was so despondent.  And then as the closer we got to Washington [D.C.] the announcer kept saying the busses are coming, the busses are coming from the north, from the south, and people were standing and jumping up, people were crying and all the rest of it.  And so, I remember when I went to that march, I never saw, but I heard him and you know, tears and whatever else, so.  We also were up there when JFK's [President John F. Kennedy] memorial, at that time had not been built and it had a little white picket fence around it and we stood around there, cause that was gonna be the first president that I was gonna vote for and I never gotten that opportunity to do so.  So, I mean, you know, I'd been to every march on Washington since the first one, so. Okay, okay.  You know they had another march in '83 [1983]?
Speaker 1: When was it, 25th (unclear), uh-huh, yeah.
Speaker 2: And then just recently this one?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Yeah another one.  So when you went up to the march, was your bus sponsored by NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] or CORE [Congress of Racial Equality]?
Speaker 1: You know, I don't even remember to tell you the truth, cause this is something my mother-in-law did, you know--we didn't do very many things together, but that one we did, and so I don't really remember whether it was her church, it could have been her church, you know, that kind of thing, but...
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 116025
Speaker 1: Then Kennedy [President John F. Kennedy] assassination was at the end of that year.  Now were you still married the time you were finishing up at Washington University [St. Louis, Missouri]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Still married.
Speaker 1: All right.  And you taught school at McKinley [High School] School [St. Louis, Missouri], afterwards, right?
Speaker 2: I taught school in St. Louis [Missouri] at McKinley, the high school, and which was the most well integrated school by just geographically.  You had Pruitt Igoe for the black students mostly and South St. Louis [Missouri] for the white students.  And, again, that was something.  Of all the things I've ever done, I really, really loved it more than anything cause when you see a kid, you can tell when a kid has got what it is that you're trying to teach.  Their faces will light up, there'd be some recognition that, "Oh, yeah, I understand this.  This is why that's important."
Speaker 1: Okay.  So more than anything else you've done, you love this the most?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So Pruitt Igoe is one of the infamous housing projects.  In those days it wasn't as bad, right?  I mean it's been knocked down since 1972, I think?
Speaker 2: It's been knocked down, but I think, I think it didn't have the criminal element that, to the extent that is now associated with a lot of public housing.  A lot of our students came out of there and many of them went on to college and so forth.  Not all, but we didn't have the--didn't have the violence it seems to be associated now with the public housing.  But I keep saying, why does public housing have to be so ugly?  Now can't you get architects who can possibly build buildings that look like something, but here it is the elevators stopped on every other floor and all the rest of that kind of stuff, so.  They want to punish poor people for being poor and that never made any sense to me, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you taught school until 1967?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now tell me if I'm missing anything that's important?
Speaker 2: Well, I also worked in the poverty program there.  I can't even think--I went to--we worked with--in the summertime, I worked with the youth--it had another name, but I can't think of it now.  And I had to work with--some of the kids were considered incorrigible.  I got my first opportunity of going into court for a young girl who had been deemed incorrigible by her relatives.  Sad story and all and I had to find an attorney for her and all the rest of it, but just bits and pieces that never seemed to come together until they all did come together.  But it was a chance again to see how the poverty program was working in St. Louis [Missouri] at that time.  So that's what I did in the summertime, and I taught during the regular part of the year.
Story_ID: 116026
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now 1967 you moved to Washington, D. C.?
Speaker 2: Sixty-seven [1967], '68 [1968], something like that, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: All right, your husband at the time got enrolled in law school there?
Speaker 2: He was in Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], right.
Speaker 1: In Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], okay.  And so you accompanied him to [Washington] D.C.?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Did you try to get a job teaching?
Speaker 2: I did.  I tried to get a job--no, I got a job working--they were going to offer me teaching social biology, which they could not define in this Lincoln Middle School [Washington, D.C.], which is now Bell, I believe it is.  And when I had asked, you know, what does that mean this social biology, they couldn't tell me, and then the person said to me, "Well, all you need are two references in order for you to teach here and you can get one from Al Capone," and he thought that was funny.
Speaker 1: So anybody (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Anybody.  The way he put it, I thought, doesn't he care who comes in here to teach these kids.  But I had a friend who was working in the poverty program and suggested that I come up for an interview, and I did.  And I started working for the United Planning Organization in, I think it was '68 [1968] at 14th and U, which where our office was which you would not recognize now.  I have a hard time trying to pick out where our office is now because of all the redevelopment. But we work with--
Speaker 1: --U Street was really the--
Speaker 2: Oh, I was there when the riots broke out.  And I worked with young men and women, ages 14 to 70, because we always said, "Why would you have that kind of a range in a poverty program?"  But it was fact--it was the guise(ph)--I worked with a white instructor there, Marion Magneson, and when the riots broke out and they said, you all need to get out of here, and they escorted us to our cars so that we can, you know, get out of the neighborhood.
Speaker 1: This is April 4th when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated?
Speaker 2: Right.  I heard the news.  We'd been doing something in the UPO [United Planning Organization] office and I hurt my back, and I went in the doctor's office and I was there where I heard the news that he [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] had been killed.  And the next day I think I went to work for some unknown reason and that's when, you know, everything sort of--it started that night but it kept getting worse and that's when they escorted us out.  And I remember Marion [Magneson] saying, okay, I'll drive in the white neighborhoods and then you drive during the black neighborhoods to get us out of here, so.  But that was the time, that was the time.
Speaker 1: Now, did [HM] Marion Barry work close by?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was at Pride [Inc.] .
Speaker 1: Pride, right.
Speaker 2: Right.  He was down there at 15th and U.  And, I mean, there were a lot of people.
Speaker 1: Did he know you from Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Because he--I was in what they called the BC Dorm, it was an honor dorm, and a lot of the graduate student girls--women were in that dorm, and he was a graduate student at that time, and he would come in and out there at that time.  Very quiet, not at all like the way he is now, but very quiet.  He's a very, very smart guy, you know, very smart guy, knows his chemistry, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's what we heard.  He's a very, very bright man.  So--sometimes it gets lost in all the media stuff about him, but he's a very bright man.
Speaker 1: He was very bright, yeah.
Story_ID: 116027
Speaker 1: Then there's been a movie made about the riots about, you know, centered around Petey Greene.  Did you know him?
Speaker 2: I knew Petey well.  I remember when I was on the air, I remember asking Petey, I was going to do a documentary on prostitution, and I asked Petey to help me find a prostitute and he got mad at me, "Why do you think I know a prostitute?"  I said, "Oh, Petey, you know everybody.  Please just give me help and whatever," but.  And I ended up actually going through the courts to get a young woman that they thought would be able to come out or whatever and do the interview for me.  But I know Petey, had him on the air many times, adored him, adored him.  He was a smart savvy guy that made a lot of differences--made a difference in a lot of people's lives, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, well maybe we'll talk more about him later when we get to the show.  But I thought I'd raise this, they had this one scene in the movie about the riots, his role.  Did he play in any major role in the-
Speaker 2: In the riot?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I don't remember.  Like for us, I guess, the most dramatic thing was the fact that nobody bothered Ben's Chili Bowl because we had two buildings, one on Florida Avenue and one on 14th and U, used to walk back and forth between the two.  And once the soldiers came in, you know all the rest of it, there was so much devastation, but not around Ben's Chili Bowl.  They were okay, so.  Wings and Things was gone, Peoples, a drug store, you know, there was a nice club across the street on U Street, Frank something like that, gone, destroyed, you know, that went by, the water from the fireman's hoses, so.  A lot of businesses were hurt.
Speaker 1: Black businesses?
Speaker 2: Black businesses.  Franks was.  I think that's right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was UPO [United Planning Organization] able to continue after the riots?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Nobody bothered our buildings.  You know, it's like they knew what we were trying to do and that--then out of all that came all the black power movement, etc.  You know, I kind of--there was a nursery school or some kind of school that was like in the same block with us and there was at some point a feeling of real community that we've lost.  You know, at one time it was just--it was a sense of solidarity, I would suppose that you say that I don't see it now.  I felt perfectly safe walking around in any of those neighborhoods with--see the guys or whatever 'cause they knew us, they knew what we were doing and whatever else and nobody could harm us with that, you know.  They wouldn't let anybody harm us.
Story_ID: 116028
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So now, in 1969 you started working with the television show 'Harambee'?
Speaker 2: Well, in between there, let me see, I think there was a time when I went to the Hotel Mayflower.  I don't remember the exact time on that before I got to Harambee.  One of the--a person that I met, I was going out trying to find jobs for some of the women who were in our program and I met this guy, Curtis White, who was in charge of Human Resources at the Mayflower Hotel, and it was owned by the Sonesta Chain at that point.  And he asked me to come over.  They were going to run a program.  It was part of a (unclear) of the poverty program, but funded through the Labor Department to try to get people who were unemployed or underemployed into different hotel fields.  And so I ran that program for a year.  And that was a glamour job, if you want to talk about a glamour job.  I had my own little table in the restaurant that they wouldn't release until I would call up there.  I learned all the backs and fronts in the hotel, but we had a high school equivalency program on site and it was opened to anyone of the employees in the hotel as well as people who we were bringing in.  And I ran into a woman whom came into my program when it first got started and they used to always call me Randy, then.  And I saw her in Tiffany's.  Now I'm in Tiffany's just window shopping, she's in there buying.  And she tells me, she said do you remember me? And I said, I think I do.  She said you gave me my first job at the Mayflower and she'd gone on up and done very well.  And those were kind of the good things that you remember about what you did and you know how it worked out.  So it was there that I was--a friend of mine was working in television and he kept hearing me talk about television can do this if only television would do that we can help more people, and he was the one who said, they're holding auditions for this new daily program, why don't you come up there and try.  And I thought--was talking to my mother about it.  I said, I don't know anything about television, and she said well, if you can make students believe that biology is interesting, you can do anything.  So with that in my back of my head, I went up there and I auditioned for that. Now, where was it?
Speaker 1: That was at Channel Nine, CBS Station in the old building on Brandywine Street.  And they had this guy, William Wright, who was an advocate and an activist in the field of television.
Speaker 2: Now was he African American?
Speaker 1: He's black, yeah.
Speaker 2: William Wright.
Speaker 1: Bill Wright, well everybody called him Bill Wright.  And I had to interview him.  And the thing of it is, he asked--we started talking about the 14th Street corridor--
Speaker 2: Was that the audition?
Speaker 1: --That was the audition.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I knew the 14th Street Corridor.  I knew what needed to be done because I had just left it.  And we didn't have an interview, we had a conversation.  I think that probably pushed me over the other people who were there who knew more about television, but I happened to know more about that particular subject matter that he brought up, because he was the one they'd set up in a mock interview.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, chance, opportunity.
Speaker 2: Okay, come together.
Speaker 1: They do come together--
Story_ID: 116029
Speaker 1: So, all right, we were just talking about [HM] Sheila Thomas, who was a friend of yours?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Had a children's show called 'The Magic Door' right?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: 'The Magic Door.'
Speaker 2: Yep, that was it.  That was it.
Speaker 1: So you all started about the same time?
Speaker 2: We did, we did.
Speaker 1: And the same station, was it the same?
Speaker 2: No, she-
Speaker 1: She was on public television, right?
Speaker 2: --I thought she was on ABC.  I'm not sure, I thought she was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was on CBS.  I know we were not on the same channels, but yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: So she was an innovator in children's programs?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And here you are, you know, you're doing something brand new.
Speaker 2: Brand new.  I had no background in it at all.  In fact many of the guests in the first you know couple of months that we were on the air came out of my rolodex from UPO [United Planning Organization], you know, that kind of thing, cause I met quite a  number of people in education, politics and whatever else doing what I did for UPO, so.
Speaker 1: So, your job was to produce the show as well?
Speaker 2: No.  I think Lavelle had convinced them that we could do the producing, a part of it, but it became pretty evident.  He had a lot of background in it, and I don't think we got on a real professional footing until Jeannie Thorton [ph.] came on, and she was like our first real producer.  And, you know, she took us off.  We didn't start the way I think--the way I know television really should start.  We started because somebody thought it was a good idea.  But I don't think they believed that we could make money out of it.  And it wasn't until some guy in the newsroom said, you know--not in the newsroom but in the mail room, said to the head, we were having some sensitivity training sessions, and some guy in the mail room said that if you believed in the program, you'd try to sell it.  And it seemed to click with this particular general manager.  And after that, you know, things were quite different.
Speaker 1: Somebody in the mail room told him that?
Speaker 2: Mail room.  We were all in--we had a heterogeneous group of people at different tables and he was the one who said to the general manager, if you believed in it, you would sell it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Made a difference.
Speaker 1: So, your job was to provide the talent for the show and-
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --And to do interviews?
Speaker 2: Initially, when I first started off, I was on there and then he said we're gonna produce it.  Well, I didn't even know what that meant.  So I did have some ideas and whatever else, but I didn't know how you produce a television program.  And as I said it wasn't until Jeannie got on board that we really began to think about, you know, the look, you know, the time, how do you do this, etc. that it began to make a difference in what we did.  We were just on the air interviewing with people.
Speaker 1: Now how much time expired before Jeannie?
Speaker 2: Jeannie came on?  Not much, I guess, maybe about, maybe three or four months, enough to have made a difference, that kind of thing, but it changed dramatically after she got a hold of it, I can tell you that, so. Okay, okay.  So, who was your first guest?
Speaker 1: Joe Yeldell.  He was--I'm not even sure what Joe's title was then, but he was in [Washington] D.C. government with the mayor and I remember he was mine.  I had a list of questions and I read them off.  I don't think I listened to one answer that he gave back.  I was just like I got one through ten, let me get through all of these, and that's exactly how I did it.  But he was my very first.  I can't even tell you who the second person was.
Speaker 2: But wasn't the flowing conversation that you had with the bill right?
Speaker 1: No, it wasn't because I was, you know, I was like this, I was just like, you know I didn't know, I mean, I didn't feel comfortable doing this.  And frankly, I didn't even like doing the show because with the added duty of being the producer of the show, I didn't know anything about, it wasn't fun.  And it didn't become fun until as I said that Jeannie came on, and then later on when Beverly Price joined us.  I mean she was like, it was like fun coming to work every day, you know, that kind of thing, so.
Story_ID: 116030
Speaker 1: Well, what did Jeannie [Thorton (ph.)] do?
Speaker 2: Well, she was our producer.  So she was the one, you know, in terms of getting the guests and so forth.  Beverly [Price] was--came after Jeannie, and she added all the fun parts about it, you know, let's do something crazy, let's do something here, whatever else and all of that and just changing things around about--one time she said, we're going to do a show with no guests, and I'm thinking what are you talking about, 'cause we were live.  She said you pick an issue, you get on there and you just kind of, you know, take your--it's almost like radio now.  You get on and tell 'em what it is and then you invite people to call you back, and we used to call it red hat day.  And I'd say all right today I'm wearing a red hat, so here's my issue, and people would call in and whatever.  We had more fun with that, you know, we didn't do it often, but we did it.  And in fact I think, you know, I'm trying to think if Beverly preceded Jeannie, but at any rate, with Jeannie, I remember one time we did a black history show.  And what would it be like if you had invited guests like [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King, Frederick Douglass, Sojourner Truth, and they all--we had actors in costumes that came on and they had to stay in their role, they had know--cause they wouldn't know what I was going to ask them, so everybody had to do kind of a history lesson on this.  So it was kind of taken like from Steve Allen's show that he did on the national public television.  And we did it with-Bobby Hooks [HM Robert Hooks] was--I can't remember whether or not he was Frederick Douglass or-
Speaker 1: So you had some top flight-
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --Robert Hooks, at the time, was the head of [Washington] D.C. Black Rep [Repartory Company], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So were they all actors and actresses from-
Speaker 2: They were, they were-
Speaker 1: --Or actors from-
Speaker 2: --There was this woman, who I can't remember her name who had made her name doing Sojourner Truth, 'cause she could do, "Ain't I a Woman" better than anybody we'd seen.  She was--and she came in as Sojourner Truth.  We even had--I thought we used Ron Dellums [HM Ronald Dellums].  Maybe Ron was Frederick Douglass 'cause he had--I mean he looked like Frederick Douglass.  But we--and you sat around in a kind of a living room with kind of atmosphere, and then I would ask questions, you know, about what do you think about today, you know, and I would take a question.  So they would come at it from their perspective of who they were attacking a local or national issue.
Speaker 1: --That was a great idea.  A friend of mine did that in Chicago, not on TV though, but a local high school, but that's a great idea.
Speaker 2: I did a speech like that just recently.  I'm not sure everybody got it, because you'd have to really know your history.  But it was for [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.]'s birthday, and I had it where Booker T. Washington, W.E.B. DuBois, Sojourner Truth and Frederick Douglass were all around there talking to Martin Luther King.  And each one--I presented each one's point of view about various topics and so forth.  And then at the very end of it, I said--Sojourner says to Martin, Oh, Martin, you know, how--something about, you know, what can we say after you've said all, cause I had some portion of his speech, what can we say to you after you said all of this, and I had them say at the very end, well, you can say happy birthday, and then I said happy birthday, Dr. King, and that's the way I ended it, but I'm not sure they all got it, cause it took a long time for me to put it all together and whatever else.  And I'm sure you know that they even understood the dynamics between booker T. Washington and W.E.B. Dubois, you know, and how Frederick Douglass, what he had to do to be educated and Sojourner Truth's statement about "Ain't I a Woman" and how that was being treated by the suffragette movement and all that.  But I wove it all in there, so.
Speaker 1: The parameters of the show was live, right?
Speaker 2: Live.
Speaker 1: How long was it?
Speaker 2: Hour.
Speaker 1: Hour.
Speaker 2: I think it was an hour, certainly, yeah, I think it was.
Speaker 1: It was a daily show, Monday through Friday?
Speaker 2: Daily, Monday through Friday, yeah.  Actually it was a half an hour, I think it was a half an hour.
Speaker 1: Okay, half an hour, okay.
Speaker 2: 'Harambee,' yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Harambee.'  And who named it?
Speaker 2: Lavelle [ph.] did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Is Kiswahili for let's-
Speaker 2: Together, yeah.
Speaker 1: --pull together?
Speaker 2: Pull together, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 116031
Speaker 1: So, the demographics of the city?
Speaker 2: Well, we were going after an all-black audience, and it was live and I don't think we had phones or anything at that time.  I don't really remember it as such.  But, you know, we'd have different segments of issues and it ranged from doctors and you know attorneys, etc., local issues, etc. being brought into it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is time, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think Washington, D.C. was 80 percent black?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yep.
Speaker 1: You talk about demographic, this-
Speaker 2: Yeah, we were in the majority and you know, we still are, but we are losing that majority, you know, that kind of thing.  I got fired from that job too.
Speaker 1: --Okay, just hold on a second.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: All right, eighty percent black-
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --Population.  You got Warner [sic, Walter] Washington was the mayor then, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And the city was poised to elect [HM] Marion Barry?
Speaker 2: Marion was a--he was on the educational--he was--board of education at that time, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So 1969, a year after the King riots [riots following the assassination of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], this is the time when corporations all over the country were opening doors for black people to come in.  A lot of professionals weren't concerned about civil rights.  Some of them have told me this, you know, ran through those doors to become the first black person to be in these positions, these professional positions and government positions.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is what's going on.
Speaker 2: Right.  For us it was like dipping down into a really rich stew because he had a lot of, you know, we had a lot of stuff that was going on, we could tackle what was going on in terms of those who were less fortunate and those who were doing well.  We had singers, we had Roberta Flack, I remember, at some point, that's later on, but had her before she became Roberta Flack, you know, that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: She was Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] alumnus, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and she used to sing over at Mr. Henry's all the time which we would go from here.  But I mean many things about us, some of it, we didn't even know about ourselves.  And I mean I had a lot to draw from with Howard University [Washington, D.C.], you know, where there are a lot of the doctors would come in and be in our program.  We talked about heart issues, high blood pressure, etc., you know, that kind of thing, so.  We had a chance to really cover a wide gamut of things that at--very early on.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's with the government being--this being a seating government-
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --And all the congressmen being here, I can just see you, and you can really do it.
Speaker 2: And the Congressional Black Caucus, I mean I had a lot of those members on our program, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the public didn't--they could call in sometimes but not all the time?
Speaker 2: I don't remember in the early days calling in.  In later days it became possible.  In fact that was really, you know, something that we sought to have them call in on, but as we expanded from, I think it was from the half an hour to the hour, I may be off on that.  But my problem is that I would walk from one set to another set later on as we expanded the program, and I don't remember whether, you know, I'm kind of thinking that it was a half an hour.  It may have started as an hour gone back to half an hour and then pulled in these other things.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 116032
Speaker 1: Now what happened when the second producer came?  You said things really got fun.
Speaker 2: Well, when Beverly came on board, she was--I can't explain Beverly.  I mean, she was--
Speaker 1: Beverly who?
Speaker 2: Beverly Price.  She actually left and went to Ebony magazine at one point and did some things.  And she still is in Chicago [Illinois].  You all ought to look her up.  She was imaginative, I guess she was, out of all of them, would kind of force me to get outside myself more in terms of, there was a, I think a tendency for those of us early on the air, you know, you want to, you know, present the best side of yourself which does not always mean you would present the crazy side of yourself, but she would--as say with the red hat bit, was a crazy thing to do, but we did it, you know, that kind of thing, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, she kind of got you to loosen up a little bit?
Speaker 2: Loosen up a little bit, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it got looser with other, you know, other producers.
Speaker 1: Now what's the, I guess the, loosest thing you ever did on the show or the most daring thing?
Speaker 2: I guess, probably, exercise, you know, it's like we did a thing that involved African dance exercising, and I mean it was like, oh my God, you know, I got through it, but I'm not quite sure how, but that was probably it. Well, you had some in dance.
Speaker 1: I did, but I mean when you're on the air, you know, at this stage too, you're trying to think, it's like, can they see this bulge or whatever else, so I mean, it makes a big difference.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, once again, Beverly Price was trying to get you to be less self-conscious?
Speaker 1: I think, you know, things just got better.  When--Jeannie had the hard one, because she had to come in and more or less bring us back to the reality of what it is to do a show, 'cause I didn't know, and Lavelle thought he knew and she had to just say, no, this is the way you really put on a show.  And she gave us that kind of structure.
Story_ID: 116033
Speaker 1: Now was there ever a time when the hosts of these different--now in the cities all over the country there were these black TV shows for the first time, and more so here, I think, than any other place.  But New York City [New York] had Gil Noble was on the air (unclear) "Like It Is" and Sarah Henshaw [ph.] with "Say Brother" in Boston [Massachusetts].  There were shows all over, Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] had one, you know, everybody had one, Detroit [Michigan].  Was there ever a time when the producers of these shows or the hosts ever got together to meet to talk about-
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --Expected television shows?
Speaker 2: I didn't.  I don't think Jeannie [Thorton (ph.)] did either.  I know I did with other people who were local, 'cause we used to have an organization called Blacks and Broadcasting, and we would meet and talk about issues.  Max Robinson was involved with us, Jimmy Vance [HM Jim Vance] over at Channel 4, [HM] Sheila [Thomas], you know, as we moved up and got more people involved in it, but we looked at it because, not only, like Max was the great one, he was like the king.  He not only looked at what was going on on the air, but what's going on behind it, how many producers do we have, how many people do we have in the executive office making decisions and so forth which was always a major issue.  So, you know, it was a great time.  We used to meet up at Billy Simpson on George Avenue and sometimes over at--what was this guy's name, he headed this place over at The Howard (unclear), but we would meet and talk about various issues in the media and do we resolve--and just had fun too, together.  But we all didn't meet quite regularly, Marilyn Robinson, who was a reporter over at NBC, she was a great part of that.
Speaker 1: So by this time, I guess by the early '70s [1970s], would it be safe to say that every station in D.C. had a black anchor or reporter?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they did.  And like my daughter said it best, and I hadn't thought about it, when she was going off to college, she said, I never even think about what I can do because I come from a city where the mayor is black, there's a black anchor on television and she went on and named so many places where you know you saw black faces and people doing things.  And I hadn't thought about it.  And so I said well we are making an impact.  You know the next generation believes I can do this then, you know, we're doing a good job.
Story_ID: 116034
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So now 'Harambee' lasted until?
Speaker 2: I don't remember when it went off the air.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But it morphed?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it did.  I morphed into "Everywoman" was (unclear) the show that followed and it had Rene Carpenter as the hostess and she at one time had another person hosting with her, I think it was JC Hayward.  Well I came over and replaced JC, so I would get off the set of Harambee and then go over and walk across the studio and get on the set for "Everywoman".  And then they put that together and it became "Nine In The Morning".  They added a male host.  It was 90 minutes that we did and Doug Llewelyn was the male host.  Then they cut it back to an hour again for "Morning Break" and I did that by myself.  And then I did the Carol Randolph Show by myself.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did the format change?
Speaker 2: It was still very much like you see today.  You know, we had--sometimes we would--we'd have, sometimes a theme, dependent upon what the topic was, segments, musical, phone-in.  I remember doing a show, and I don't know why this sticks in my mind, but we were talking about homosexuality and there was a tendency for the members of the panel that was up there to be condescending to some of the questions that were coming in, cause some of them could be really rather ridiculous and show a definite lack of knowledge.  And I remember saying that if you hear it from one person then you know there's many more behind him that believes this.  You need to give them an answer.  And the guy on the program said she's absolutely right.  And then he went around and answered that question.  Now stands out in my mind simply because it was an open phone question.  One of the best fun shows I ever did was with Billy Eckstine and Joe Williams.  That was--cause as a teenager I had a crush on Billy Eckstine.  And who didn't love Joe Williams with that deep voice of his and they performed.  So it was a great show that I'm so sorry that we don't have.  And we did a special with Eubie Blake.  Claude Matthews was the co-host at that time.  And we did a--that was just before Eubie actually died and he played.  It was a wonderful, wonderful experience.
Speaker 1: Now he's a pioneer black (unclear).  How old was he when he died?
Speaker 2: Was he in his nineties or something like that when he died, I think he was.  His fingers could still move up and down the piano, you know, so. Yeah, I think they did this show.  What was the Broadway show did in his--
Speaker 1: Oh, "Scott Joplin."  Oh no, "Ragtime."  Was that what you were talking about.  Oh, no, not "Ragtime".
Speaker 2: --It was a Eubie Blake show and he was on '60 Minutes.'
Speaker 1: Yes.  Uh-huh, but we were before them.  And I don't know how we happened to get him before them, but we did, you know, and we did a special with him that aired at night time.  Now I remember doing a show, who was the co-host of that one.  I don't even remember now, but we did a late night show cause somebody had decided that there was an audience for late night, and we were talking about sex and a whole bunch of things on that one.  That was an interesting show.  That was a fun show.
Speaker 2: So it lasted for a few years, or--
Speaker 1: That was only for a pilot.  We just did it just to see if there was an audience out there.  There was.  I don't remember now why they didn't decide to go on and, in fact, just sitting here talking to you about it has brought that back to me, you know, to my mind.  But I had forgotten about it, yeah.
Story_ID: 116035
Speaker 1: Okay. Let's see--I think you told me off camera about the show there was an AIDS victim on the show-
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and some of the attitudes?
Speaker 2: Well, we were in the forefront of talking about AIDS and when a guest came on who had AIDS, some of the crew members did not want to mic him and it took the reporter who specialized in health and science to  come downstairs into the studio and say, listen, you know, you can't catch it like this, etc., etc.  And then I ended up miking 'cause we're a live show.  We had to go on the air at ten o'clock so you know I miked him.  And then when the show was over, one of the technicians came up with newspaper and took it off and threw them--the mikes away.  Now that was then, you know, we even had a baby who had AIDS.  Mother had transfusion or something, I don't remember now how the baby had contracted the disease and he just--he was in such agony, and she had him on the floor of the set, you know, so that you could shoot him, you know, see him.  And all the women in this production staff, myself and then the audience wanted to go and pick him up and whatever.  And she said my attorney said that none of you can pick up the baby 'cause that was the fear factor about AIDS at that time.  I didn't mention to you that we had an audience in many of the shows that we did, so that I would also work the audiences as well as to, you know, to take phone calls too.  That would be later on as we moved into either nine in the morning or whatever else, but--to use an audience.
Speaker 1: Okay so you had the popular show going--talk show going, this is prior to Oprah Winfrey?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  In fact it was Oprah that knocked us off the air cause then it was cheaper for them to buy that and whatever, I guess easier and she certainly had the ratings and we didn't have, but it--the while that we were on it, we broke a lot of ground in new things that we did in terms of presenting information out to our audience.
Story_ID: 116036
Speaker 1: Now while the show ['Harambee'] was in its heyday, you returned to school, right?
Speaker 2: I did.  I went to law school.  And I was a single mom by then and I looked around and I said, well, I don't know how long--in television, you know, you're as good as your last show and your ratings, etc.  And I said I've got a kid that I've got to get through college and so forth.  I need to be able to fall back on something that's going to give me some money and whatever.  And so I had a friend who was over at Catholic University [of America, Washington, D.C.] and he said, why don't you, you know, take the LSAT, and I did.  And I went over to Catholic cause I thought it had the more reasonable schedule that--three nights a week, four years--was it four years and one summer, three nights a week, in order for you to get out with that and that's what I did.  But the funny part about it, just before I signed up for it, the station under the direction of general manager, Jim Lina [ph.], had instituted a new program where they would pay your educational cost if you were gonna go back to school.  And so when I put in my invoice to get, you know, reimbursed for law school, he said Carol, we never thought anybody would go to law school.  So then after I brought that up, they changed the rules so that if you go back to school for anything that's related to broadcasting, but they paid my, was it two thirds of my cost of going to law school the whole time I was there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were in law school from '74 [1974] to '78 [1978]?
Speaker 2: Seventy-seven--it must have--must have started in seventy, maybe '73 [1973], but I graduated in '77 [1977].
Speaker 1: Seventy-seven, all right.  And the show went on for another nine years, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So at the end of the show, is that when you took the bar exam?
Speaker 2: No.  I didn't take the Bar.  When I went off the air, I must have taken the Bar in '88' (1988), because I knew that--I think it was ten years or so between the time that I graduated and whatever else, and you don't remember all that stuff.  Plus the Bar is not like anything else that--in fact, in many ways it's very remote from what you learn in law school.  And so I took a year, and I  went--I saw tapes, went to the Bar review classes and so forth and had my study group that included Roscoe Dellums [HM Leola "Roscoe" Dellums] who is Ron Dellums' [HM Ronald Dellums] ex-wife.  She made those classes hysterical.  She's got the funniest sense of humor.  And we all took the Bar in Pennsylvania, because if you could pass the Bar high enough, the multi state part of it, you could waive into the district, which is what we all, you know, sought to do.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  After you passed the Bar, was this about the time you started working with Goldfarb Singer and Willett?
Speaker 2: Not right away.  I was writing a column when I left the Channel Nine.  The Washington Times asked me to join them to write a column and I'm saying, you know, I don't know anything about writing a column.  And their words were we will not let you fail.  And when I said teaching was like one of the things I loved, that was another thing.  I loved that because I had to think of the topics that I wanted to write about.  And I wrote about everything, including when my stepson came to visit.  I obviously remarried.  My stepson came to visit and brought three of his classmates with him for a summer.  And they were all in college and I wrote about the difference between raising boys and raising a daughter.  And I talked about how clothes exploded all over the room and all the rest of that, so I had a ball with those guys.  And loved picking topics.  I did a ride-a-long with one of the guys who took the Bar with me was a police officer, and I did a ride-a-long with him from midnight to six a.m.--not midnight, I think I started a little bit earlier than that.  And boy I walked away with a great deal of appreciation of what police officers did.  And he thought it was a slow night.  So, you know, that that kind of--but I would never have had the opportunity to do it in as much depth as I did with him, working in television, so.
Story_ID: 116037
Speaker 1: So, the Washington Times, so you're writing a column for the Washington Times, but you said you hit a wall there.  They wouldn't published one of your--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I hadn't--
Speaker 1: --Columns?
Speaker 2: --I got sent to Israel by the Congressional Black Caucus during the First Intifada.  And my friends over there, a Jewish guy married to a Palestinian woman.  And they helped set up my trip and I had a chance to meet a wide range of people, a doctor who ran a Palestinian hospital and I got a chance to go down to Gaza and with the curfew was going on, I talked to a woman whose house had been bulldozed and there was only the back wall standing up and she explained the devastation of her house by saying well one son was PLO [Palestine Liberation Organization], one was Communist and one was Hezbollah, I believe she said.  So what could they do, meaning, I guess, the government, which, seemed like a, you know, an acceptance of her own reality.  But I met with--after hours, we had this--we could only meet with Jewish and the Palestinians, I mean Jerusalem on the Arab side because they could not cross over because of the curfew.  And one of them said--a Jewish guy was saying that he grew up with Palestinian neighbors and he knew peace was possible, but he was so fearful of the next generation, because there was no interaction; they didn't live together, around each other, near each other, go to school, etc.  So the walls that were being built up were even getting even higher, and the--I remember the doctor at the hospital gave this story, 'cause you couldn't tell who was who by the names, you know, because Jewish and Palestinians often had the same last names, etc.  And he met this reporter who wrote for the Jerusalem Rule, the newspaper there, and he invited him to his home.  He was so impressed with what he was doing.  And his daughters, the little girls were there and they said this is Doctor So and So, and they were, you know, coming up to greet him and then he said and he's the doctor at the Palestinian hospital and they drew their hands back, and he said the father apologized and so forth.  But that was an outstanding example.  He said to the fact that if we don't resolve this now, we will not be able to do so in the future.  So I wrote that.  I wrote those stories and whatever else.  And the guy who's my editor, said that I was being naive.  And they never were published.  I don't have copies of them now, unfortunately, because it was on floppy disk and whatever else.  I don't know what happened to them.  But you know it was such an experience for me to go out beyond the United States to cover something like that.  It was very, very--made an--impactful.
Story_ID: 116038
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you decide not to write anymore?
Speaker 2: Well, I was--got involved at that point with "Songs of My People" you know I was doing this at the same time I was over with the law firm.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Goldfarb, Singer and Ross [sic, Goldfarb, Kaufman, & O'Toole], I have a note here that you started in '87 (1987) with them?
Speaker 2: I thought it was maybe '88 (1988) when I got there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, 1988.  How did this come about and-
Speaker 2: Well, I knew Ron [Ronald Goldfarb] very much.  I mean, and again, books, I knew he was an agent, I wanted to study more about being an agent for writers, etc. cause that was the one thing that I prized out of all the things that I did at television.  I had all these signed copies of books and I read every book of every author that I interviewed.  You know, it was very rare for somebody to come on and meet this--In fact, it only happened once when somebody showed up we didn't know and was coming up and somebody handed me some notes.  So I had this love of books and I went to Ron and I said I want to, you know, come learn from you.  And so I became kind of like of counsel with them and later on, you know, kind of became part of the firm.  And that's when we did the book, "Songs of My People" was when I was with, it was Goldfarb Kaufman and--at that time that we were writing, you know, the partnership.  And that was a wonderful experience, but it was while I was there that I sent a note to Fred Graham when--he was on the Court T.V., and I just said congratulations and whatever else.  He sent me a note back, said how would you like to come up here and talk about, you know, auditioning for a job working on Court TV?
Story_ID: 116039
Speaker 1: Now we go back to songs for my--"Songs of My People"--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --which is a line from, is it a poem by Margaret Walker?
Speaker 2: I think it was, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I didn't pick it, the guys did, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now the guys are black photographers, right?
Speaker 2: Black photographers.  Eric Easter was the--he's not a photographer, he was kind of like the editor, Michael Cheers who worked for Ebony and for the life of me, can't think of the other guy, but I will, but he was a photographer for the Washington Post.  And they had this idea about getting fifty photographers from all over, you know, to come and to take a snap shot of life from an African American point of view.  And we were able to get a Little, Brown, then part under Time Warner, who agreed to publish it.  And then it became like, took off, like then they were gonna take the big panels and make it into a museum and it was gonna travel all over and it did.  So it became a little great idea that became a bigger great idea, so.
Speaker 1: What photographers took part or some of them anyway.  Who were some of the photographers?
Speaker 2: Oh, my God, I can't remember all of them.  You've covered one of the guys, [HM] Roy Louis.  To tell you the truth--
Speaker 1: Did [HM] Gordon Parks take part in this?
Speaker 2: --No, no--
Speaker 1: [HM] Chester Higgins [Jr.].
Speaker 2: --No.  They were not the big, big names.  They were mostly younger men who--and women, I should put that in there.  And many of them--they were not selected by me, they were selected by Michael and I got--I'm gonna get this guy's name if it kills me, but--and Eric--and they would farm the bulk, they were the driving force behind it, you know.  I just kind of gave them a roof over their heads until they were able to get this all together.
Speaker 1: And the resulting product was an exhibit, not big coffee table but--
Speaker 2: But I have it here.
Speaker 1: (unclear)
Speaker 2: Yeah, it did very well, and it started a trend after that, I prefer, you know, I don't think anybody had tried to do anything at least on the scale that these guys had tried to do before.  And it took about a year, you know, to really pull this together, you know, to get it all done and then the meetings we had in New York, and then with the [HM] Toni Fay from Time Warner 'cause they were the ones who pushed the bid.  And then we had a big reception at the Corcoran Art Gallery, so it was a big deal.
Story_ID: 116040
Speaker 1: Now, Court TV.  Now your--tell us about--what did you say before, you said that--
Speaker 2: Well, I had written a--I had written a note when they said Fred Graham had been, you know, had gone off to Court TV.  Now, I don't remember now how exactly I knew Fred or whether I interviewed him or whatever, but I sent him a note saying, congratulations.  And then he had a guy call me and said, "Listen, would you like to come up and audition?"  And I'm thinking oh, my God, you know, that kind of thing.  New York, you know, what does that mean, 'cause my husband was here and all that.  So, some of the guys at the law firm told me I must be crazy if I didn't get up there and do that cause it was so interesting, when I finished law--of taking the Bar, I went around to several judges, attorneys and so forth and said I really want a career in law, and they kept saying to me, well we always would like to do what you do in television, you know, and so I'm thinking, maybe I got this backwards here.  But I went on up there to New York and long story short, I was given a job to anchor.  Then I had to scurry around and find a place to live.  I wasn't sure how this is gonna work in terms, like my husband and I had had a commuter marriage before when he worked for Governor Kerry and then when he went to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and then you know, we've done it before but not as consistent as this looked like this was going to be.  And I liked it, you know, you could feel the vibration, you know, the energy when you were doing New York.  We covered cases--the Menendez case [Erik and Lyle Menendez], the palimony case [Maglica v. Maglica (1998)] involving the people who owned Maglite [Anthony and Claire Maglica] and then of course the "O.J. Simpson trial," which really put Court TV on the map.
Story_ID: 116041
Speaker 1: So did you have to move out to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] for that?
Speaker 2: No.  They had a reporter out there.  Actually, I was on the air when they had just gone into making the decision, cause you know these views about what was gonna happen and so forth.  And I always felt that the prosecution had not done a very good job in terms of laying out their case.  They'd over done it in terms of the DNA evidence, etc.  And I remember one of my professors in law school said, "If you gonna go out to shoot a king, you better have a kings-sized rifle."  I didn't think they had it and especially with that bit about with the glove, you know, if it doesn't fit, you must have acquit which is the way it was presented in the closing arguments.
Speaker 1: Yeah, by Johnnie Cochran?
Speaker 2: By Johnnie Cochran.  And I thought--I remember when O.J. Simpson put on those gloves, I think he was just as surprised as anybody that the things didn't fit.  'Cause you know, I had done domestic law, not a lot of it when I was in Washington [D.C.], and the one thing I always thought, when a woman--when a man finally understands that a woman may really, one who has been abused, is really leaving you, she's in the most danger at that point.  Because they don't see whatever, the beating up or any of these other things that they've done as being criminal because she deserved it, I'm entitled, that kind of thing.  And so when the first story broke that she was dead and he was arrested, I thought he had done it.  I just didn't think the prosecution ever proved it.  So I was on the air talking to Ricky Clemmon [ph.], she was out in California, and all of a sudden they said, oh, oh, we got a verdict.  But they didn't know what it was 'cause they had to bring in all the people, but it was very quick.  So everybody thought it was gonna be a guilty verdict.  And Steve Brill [ph.] had sent around this notice to saying there would be no outburst, you know, if you did that, you would be fired.  But that was Steve Brill, you know, he would give you these extreme kind of you know notifications.  And then when it came in, it was a not guilty thing.  It was like most amazing to a lot of people.  But it really wasn't to me because I think Marcia Clark thought she could handle that kind of a jury.  I understand black people, I understand black women, whatever.  Well, I have been, since, on a jury here and I can't tell you I can understand black people because we don't march in the same way.  You know, you can say, you know, black people are gonna do this that and the other as she thought she could identify with and what they did was, you know, they were waiting for some kind of a hook, and Johnnie Cochran gave it to them with this, "If it doesn't fit, you must acquit."  And there you have it.  But it was on the air, and then O.J. Simpson called in and I was on the air one time.  I didn't recognize his voice.  I don't remember now exactly what it was he wanted to talk about-
Speaker 1: Did he call incognito or did he-
Speaker 2: --He even--no, he said this is--I was on the air and somebody came flying into the studio and said, O.J. Simpson is on the air.  And he was trying to explain, I think, this was when his--the second trial was up, you know about the civil trial.  I don't remember his question, but he and I got into a discussion about that, so those are things that stand out in my mind about Court TV.
Story_ID: 116042
Speaker 1: --That's interesting, a lot of people, you know, journalists and what they thought about the case.  You think the prosecution just really didn't make their case?
Speaker 2: Uh-uh (shaking head, no).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know I couldn't step away from what I knew about domestic violence.  And stabbing a person is such a personal crime.  You know if you said somebody shot her or whatever else, that kind of thing, but to stab somebody, how he did it or how he got away with it, I don't know, can't figure that out.  I mean I heard all kinds of theories and so forth.  But nothing else makes any sense to me in terms of what happened to her.  And I've seen it happen, heard it has happened that when a man is--usually a man, finally hears a woman say, I'm gone, I'm out the door then she's extremely vulnerable.
Speaker 1: What do you make of the fact that O.J. Simpson though he wasn't vilified by the black community, but he wasn't really a hero before this took place.  I mean, it seems to become, you know, was more of a hero when he was acquitted than he was before?
Speaker 2: Well, I think because nobody else had ever beaten the system, and he had enough money to buy, you know, the experts to defeat some of the issues regarding DNA, cause those guys really knew what they were talking about, just dragged everything else.  He had Johnnie Cochran, who he could pay, cause he started out with two guys who really didn't know a lot about criminal law, Shapiro and I've forgotten the next one, the other guy.  But he had the resources, which you normally don't see in a criminal case involving black people.  And you know not to say that everybody ought to walk or whatever else, but I think from that perspective, a lot of black folks were saying, you know, for once, you know, somebody was showing what money can really do, could really can buy and I think that was it more than anything.  Plus you know, we as a people, we're more forgiving.  I don't know, especially, you know, black women to some extent, we're more willing to say, you know, what, you know, turn the other cheek or whatever else, and I--I think that also went to his favor too.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  What other cases-
Speaker 2: Menendez, if you remember that.
Speaker 1: Two brothers [Erik and Lyle Menendez].
Speaker 2: Two brothers.  That was violent.
Speaker 1: What were they accused of?
Speaker 2: Both of them were accused of murdering their parents.  And it was, I mean, it was the most ridiculous trial I'd ever seen in my life, which included somebody, an expert sitting up there singing, you know, oh, and it went on and on.  California trials go on and on and on.  Texas trials were always interesting to me because in one instance I'd say I think the judge had even a gun or something or referenced to it.  And then there was a trial in North Carolina that, it was running the same time that O.J. Simpson was, murder, double murder, lots of DNA evidence but they clipped right on through it, in a very succinct way with experts here, experts there, but California has Hollywood.  And I, you know, my understanding was the judge was like, you know, some Hollywood star would come in and they were running, you now, in and out of the court room.  He'd stop, you know, and have them--have a recess and he'd go in his chambers and they were sign a autograph.  All these things were going on which dragged that out as long as it did, but that was going on too.  And a lot of the evidence, frankly, didn't get on the air because the newspaper or the media jumped in there in many instances and co-opted it, buying people, you know, I want this that and the other.  I don't know how much of it actually would have made a difference, but we did not have--the crime scene expanded out like someone said this may be the first time when a guilty man was really--guilty man was framed for doing, you know, what he did, so.
Speaker 1: Right.  Yeah, a lot of people thought, you know, there were a lot of black people that think and don't really say (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Well, it could have been.  You know, I don't know whether the police (simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: --(unclear)Actually was framed?
Speaker 2: --Yeah, right.  I mean, you know, I don't know whether the police did, you know, everything they should have done, but these were all issues that came up, were put under a microscope, added with a dash of Hollywood to it and then you got this thing going on and on.  But I mean I think the domestic issue that--I always thought that the prosecution really wanted to win that case, they would have had a black women on their team.  'Cause I think they, you know, that person could have counter balanced what was going on with the defense, and they didn't think like that.
Speaker 1: And the black person they had was Chris Darden.
Speaker 2: Right.  And he was not up to task on that, you know, that kind of thing.  And nobody really looked at the background of domestic violence the way I think that they should have done, 'cause there was--there was a lot of what they couldn't get in, but you know, this was not the first time that issue had risen involving O.J. Simpson and with other people, so.
Story_ID: 116043
Speaker 1: So you were with Court TV until the year 2000, and in 2000 what happens, just kind of run through it?
Speaker 2: Well, my contract wasn't renewed, that was one thing.  And I think I'd run my course with Court TV, and I came home.  That was a year of personal issues with me.  My mother [Clarice Dreer Davis] was ill, I had my own illnesses that was going on at that time.  I didn't know it until later on.  And--but I came and went back to work for Walls Communications then in public relations and loved that, loved him, learned a lot from him and people associated with him.
Speaker 1: This is John McMahan?
Speaker 2: No, this is not John.  Walls Communications preceded John-- Okay.
Speaker 1: --Yeah.  But John McMahan was a client, became a client of ours through Rod Woodson, who was attorney, partner with Holland and Knight.  And my meeting with John would lead to me to being with the Miller Construction Company.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right and Walls Communications-
Speaker 1: That was what I came into, uh-huh.
Speaker 2: And you were with them until 2006?
Speaker 1: I think that's right.  I think that's right, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And then you joined Miller and Long Concrete Construction, a giant in concrete construction.  I think I read all the-
Speaker 1: Right, yeah.  It was the biggest in the nation at one point.  I don't even know whether we still are, but you know.  But my relationship with John started in 2001 when he wanted to--he was running some issues regarding his merit shops and the unions and whether we were hiring people in the district, etc.  So there were two organizations we started right then.  The JOBS Coalition was one and the other, later on, was the D.C. Students Construction Trades Foundation.  Because John said we're looking at the employment industry in the wrong way.  We're looking at the back end instead of the front end.  If we're trying to get people to come into construction, we need to do something where we can reach them younger, at a younger age, and that's when we started the Academy of Construction Design at Cardozo [High School, Washington, D.C.] in 2005. --Cardozo is a high school?
Speaker 2: It's a high school.  But we went around, I mean, let me tell you, it took us all of that ten years to even get to that point, because we had issues with--if you deal with a bureaucracy, like a school board, or whatever else--I remember going down to talk to the school board and there was a kid who was a student member of the school board.  And one school board member was saying, well why aren't you doing this east of the river, which is where he was from.  Well, we had tried.  We'd gone over there first to a principal there, who wasn't interested.  And we were at Cardozo because the principal there, Reginal Ballard, had said I want it in my school.  So the kid listened to us talk about what all were going to do and we were trying to do it like what we'd seen done in the other jurisdictions.  And they had just had a discussion on truancy, just before we came up to testify.  And he turned to his other board members, he said, well, if we had a program like this, which is more interesting, maybe we wouldn't have the truancy that we do.  And we all said out of the mouths of babes, you know that kind of thing.  But it was--I can't even three hours is not long enough to tell you all the issues we confronted just trying to get that together.  But we set up a board made up of all the leading construction of companies around there, at least most of them, many of them, not all, but many of them who contributed to have us get this thing off the ground.  We hired someone which we paid for, the Foundation pays.  And one of the things we wanted to do was to have a student built house, and we did that in 2010 started it, and 2012, we sold it at market price.  But it wasn't easy, none of this is easy.  Our kids have been involved in renovating the school--Cardozo was renovated last year and the students were involved in it.  And the irony of it for me, personally, is that here I am back in the field that my father [John Davis, Sr.] taught.  My dad never taught me anything at all, because I wasn't interested in it.  I can't even change a tire, but my brothers can.  But he did--you know, I saw him do things around the house and use, you know, phrases about, you know, tools and so forth.  And here I am working with students now who are doing the kind of thing, at least trying to do what he was trying to teach them in the high school in Saint Louis, Missouri.  So it's like a nice little circle.
Story_ID: 116044
Speaker 1: So this program takes most of your time with--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I do--I don't run the program.  I'm really kind of like the liaison, I'm kind of like the titular head.  And I also help with the JOBS Coalition, which is what we also started, which works with adults.  We, at one time, had job forums and job fairs in every sector of the city.  And I'll be meeting in 2013 to educators to talk about what are ways that businesses can work with educators to make the school system better.  We hope to have a forum on that in 2014, if we're lucky enough to pull the right people.  It's nothing new, people have done it before, etc.  But maybe this time it'll click and make a major difference, 'cause clearly something needs to be done.  You (unclear) much different it is.  I mean, most of the problems that we have now in schools, disciplinary problems, are with girls.  Not to say that the guys don't get in it too, but the first fights of the school year occurred with girls, you know, and I'm just trying to think of ways to make a difference with some of these kids who carry more baggage than any of us do today, even as adults.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you are civically engaged almost to the saturation point, I mean, you were naming some of the things you do and involved in all kinds of projects, from the Links to I guess the AKAs [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority] to you know doing civic projects.  Tell us something about the things you're doing?
Speaker 2: Well, right now, not as much as I used to.  I just got off a board working with female ex-offenders.  We went under because of grant money.  We didn't get enough of it coming in and that was painful, because we were helping a lot of women and we lost a major contract.  The major contract was cut down because of sequestration, etc.  It made a major impact on us.  So the kinds of things that I'm involved in are now pretty much connected to what makes interest to me.  I was on a board that worked with foster kids, and I got off that too, because of the other things that we were doing.  So right now I'm just taking it slow in terms of activities.  I volunteer up at elementary school, Shepherd Elementary School, on Fridays.  It's an early reading program and I love it.  Anybody who says that a good teacher can handle any class no matter what it's--the size of the class, hasn't been in a class room, cause even though we only have sixteen kids trying to teach them to read, sometimes with only three kids, you can have different levels.  And how these teachers are able to juggle, you know, different levels of kids' interests and activities--I've got one little girl, who insists on kicking the top--the bottom of the table when she gets to a point where she gets frustrated, which of course, is a distraction to the other kids, etc.  So, I know, I mean, I leave out of there every Friday with increased impression in terms of what teachers do and how much a good teacher can make a difference in a kid's life.  But I do--I have a book club that I do, that again.  And we started out saying we're gona to read only small books, where we're now doing the Goldenfit--Goldfinch, which is 700 pages like--that just shows you.  But it's--I'm not as into a lot of things cause it'll come to me.  As I said I stopped doing one thing cause it went under on us.  But I'm sure I'll turn a corner and I'll look up and I'll find myself involved in something else, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there any specific project that you're not working on right now that you would--is an ideal project something that you would really want to do?
Speaker 2: Well, I really wanted, like--now this may sound--it's not a project that I'm working with, but through the Academy, a couple of things that I want to see happen with them.  My father [John Davis, Sr.] built my daughter this huge doll house that was coming apart.  I took it--I had it taken down to Cardozo to have the kids work on it.  It had lights, the windows went up and down, the doors opened.  I wanted--if they could finish it up so that we could then donate it to a shelter.  We've already talked to them.  And the person of the shelter thinks that it would be a wonderful idea because it kind of gives kids without a home something to kind of deal with.  And I would like for then our students to make some other model homes that we can donate and give away to kids in foster homes or--not foster homes, but shelters, etc.  So that's one thing that I would like to see happen.  I work every spring, we have our meet the future luncheon, where the kids get a chance to intermingle with people who come from our industry.  I'd love to be able to get Michelle Obama to come just to talk to that.
Story_ID: 116045
Speaker 1: Do you have a next step?  I know you, you know, you've done a lot, but do you have something that you ideally want to do?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't know.  I never have planned a lot of what has happened to me, I kind of fallen into it.  I guess if I was going to do something, I always said I wanted to write something, and then I don't know whether I'm focused enough to do that.  That's why I was so surprised when my daughter wrote a book.  I told her when she was through, I said, I really admire you because you could sit down and do that.  I started to write something when I left Court TV initially and then I got distracted and whatever else.  So all I can say is that I close no doors.  I just--something will come.  I would like to see the Academy get on its feet to the point where it could handed off to someone.  But I wasn't kidding you when I said really rather wear out than rust out, I really like--keep going, doing something.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when you consider everything that you've done at this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: I might do the things that I did with the local television a little differently.  I think I would have had more fun with it.  I think I was much too serious about it, cause what people don't understand, the hardest part about being on the air is the fact that you always have to be up.  I don't care if you got a bad day or something happened or whatever else, if you're on the air, you are supposed to be up.  But I think I would do that a little differently.  And every once in a while, I'd love to go back, I say, and write something for a column and whatever else, you know, do periodic things on that.  I have done a few editorial kinds of things that I've had an op-ed pieces, but you know, not much that I think I would change differently.  Just have a little bit more fun with it.
Story_ID: 116046
Speaker 1: Do you think that television is lacking a black view point today?
Speaker 2: I think television is lacking common sense and you know decorum, civility, you know, when I see these programs like "Bad Girls" where the girls are fighting each other and nobody will take responsibility for bad behavior, assuming that that all happens in the community, it doesn't.  We're contributing a lot to the down fall of a lot of--the lack of civility, if you will.  I think black people--I still don't think we're in control the way I would like to see it done in terms of who makes the decision about what's going on the air. I think there's still a lot of like--we still don't have a lot of diversity in terms of who we are as a people, because we run all the ways from you know the head shaking, whatever to the surgical whatever else.  You see some of it, but I guess overall I would want to see the people in the head office, people who hire the talents, etc. that we see more of that.  I'm glad to see more movies that are beginning to make sense, like the "Twelve Years of Slave" you know.  That took a lot of courage to put that on. I don't know how well it's doing in the box office, cause that's always a driving force behind what we do, which is unfortunate, which is why I say, if we can put more people with more money or whatever else, or of color and are of different gender and that kind of thing, I think we would make more progress.
Story_ID: 116047
Speaker 1: But then I didn't think we--I'd ever see a black president.  So, who knows?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Was there ever any discussion on 'Harambee' or the subsequent you know mutations of 'Harambee' or evolution of 'Harambee' about a black president or black political power?
Speaker 1: Oh, we talked about black power a lot, but we always had this caveat not in our lifetime, cause I don't think we ever thought we'd see it.  And certainly not, you know, even when my parents would say it and then their--my grandfather would say it.  But we talked about opening the door, being prepared, those were all the kinds of things that I heard growing up.  I don't know what these kids hear today, whether they're not--they really understand all that went forth, which is why what you're doing is so important for them to even get to the point where they are today.  You know, I really admire the Jewish people in terms of having the Synagogue schools where their history is never forgotten, it's passed on.  I think it strengthens you.  And I think, you know, that's something that I would like to see us do, have it incorporated in some capacity.  But I've been saying that for years and it still hasn't been done, and I haven't done much to promote it other than to talk about it.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So when you see the church providing cultural education (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I think some do.  Some churches have pathways.  They call them by different names, but in terms of really having a mandated history, you can't be active in a Jewish Synagogue and not know your history.  I don't know whether that's mandated in our churches.  We're doing a boot camp at the Academy right now. It doesn't have our history cause we have Hispanic and black kids in our program, boys and girls.  But what we are trying to do is take the rough edges off, make them more ready to go out into the world to do whatever they want to do and feel comfortable about it.  I don't think a year is enough time for us to do it, but at least it's a start.  I think that with our history, it ought to start in the grade schools and whatever else and then like Miss Cooper and then move on into those places where you have a captive audience.  Many churches are more concerned about the soul as opposed to worrying about what's going into the head, and I think that history is an important part of making us who we are going to be in the future and who we are now.
Story_ID: 116048
Speaker 1: Do you have any thoughts about the independent black schools in [Washington] D.C.?
Speaker 2: We have charter schools, some are good, some are bad.  We've even looked in the possibility about one for ourselves.  And it may be that that's what you'll have to do. But I think it's incumbent upon all of us, I suppose, who are in a position to give a story to, like my grandfather, tell you this little story.  I had an awful time once, as a substitute teacher, I walked into just a mess.  The kids were out of control and whatever else.  Teacher didn't leave behind a guideline for me to use.  And I started telling them about black cowboys, because my grandfather had told me about black cowboys.  And when they left out, I told him, I said, I'm not going back, I'm not going back 'cause these kids were just so awful.  I went back the next day, and before I could open my mouth to say anything, one of the kids stood up said want to apologize for what happened yesterday, want to thank you for what you just told us about our history.  And I mean that, that little bit of words from him kept me teaching.  And it all started also because my grandfather told us the story about black cowboys and some of the famous black people who were out there doing all kinds of things, you know, so.
Story_ID: 116049
Speaker 1: Now you've addressed this all through your interview, but what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: I hope I say to every little girl that I see, "Do you know how beautiful you are?" cause I think we get all kind of mixed messages to our girls about what is important in terms of beauty and whatever else.  I'd like to see us really understand the strength that we have as a people to have gone through as much as we've gone through to get where we are today.  But we can't do it all just by being basketball players and actors and rappers and all the rest of us, but that if a book can open your mind to all kinds of possibilities I'd like to see that kind of thing occur in our schools.  I don't know what I would like for our black community per se other than the fact that that old statement, "Each One, Teach One".  I think I'd like, you know, to see that happen.  I think we all have to be mentors in some way to a kid, no matter what age you are.  I think we need to be--I'm proud of Obama, but I mad at him too, cause I couldn't understand why in the world you would let your one signature piece of legislation run out of there without looking back to see is it ready to go instead of letting all these people drive you crazy.  There's so much of wealth of good things that are going on in our community right now, in spite of all the bad stories.  I'd like for more of us to write about it, to do more movies about it, to fight for the--to get in there--exposed out there so that our kids will know about it as they're coming up.  And trust in God and cross your fingers and we'll see where we go.
Story_ID: 116050
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now when you look again at the body of work that you've been able to produce on TV and otherwise, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I'm always fascinated by what people come up to me and say, you know.  It used to bother me when people would say, you know, you're like an institution, cause I always felt like that, oh, God, like ancient and Smithsonian, here I am.  But they never quite give the same story about which shows stands out in their minds.  I remember certain things, like a lot of people remember the show that I had when my daughter--I interviewed my daughter on the air.  Now I interviewed her on the air because it was a big snow storm, and I had no guests and she was with me.  And I just had to remind her, I said, now there's just some things you don't discuss on television.  But you never know how you've touched someone and then they'll come up and they'll say, I learned about this, I learned about that.  I'm glad that we have this wide body of topics that we gave, and we gave them a lot to think about, from sign language to, you know, AIDS as I said, to cooking shows.  I had Patti LaBelle fix something on the air, Paul Prudhomme and all that, Craig Claiborne, you know, were all on the air.  So things that people pick out what is interesting to them.  So it was our job to give them as many choices as they can possibly get.  And I think we did that.
Story_ID: 116051
Speaker 1: Tell us about your family.  You're married for the second time, and you have children, tell us about your children?
Speaker 2: Well, I have a daughter who just wrote a book, "Coach on Call" which is on Amazon, that's my commercial. Stepson who is just--I couldn't have produced a boy like this.  He's just wonderful, three granddaughters.  The oldest is seven and then we have twins who are four and they are something, they are a pistol.  My husband [Frank Jasmine] is--everybody knows him as Jake, you know, he works at the social security, but he's been involved in politics most of his life.  He worked for Charlie Rangel [HM Charles B. Rangel], [HM] Marion Barry, Hugh Carey.  So he's had a governor, a congressman and a mayor that he's worked for.  He's been in criminal justice, 'cause we've had arguments a lot about politics.  I'm more conservative than he is.  And once somebody even suggested that we have our own television program because he is more liberal than I am about a lot of things, and I think he throws money at stuff, which I think people ought to be able to really kind of look see if it's well spent, you know, all that kind of thing, but it's--I respect him, he respects me.  He, in many instances is like my biggest fan, which I sometimes say to him, is that what you really mean, and he would say, I wouldn't say it if I didn't mean it, all that kind of stuff.  But I think family is very important to me.  A lot of my vacations throughout most of my adult life have been involved with my family.  We travel quite a bit, taking some cruises, etc.  And so I learn a lot from them.  I feel comfortable with them.  And we go out every summer to San Francisco [California] to be with the grandkids and all.  So it's an interesting thing, 'cause I'm not--I'm not close enough to them every day for it to be, you know, come over for cookies and so forth, so the lot of growing on is going on without us being around and see it.  But when we're there, it's, it's--children are fascinating to me.  And to see how they think, you know, and maneuver, manipulate and the rest of it, so I'm enjoying this stage of my life.  It's each chapter, you turn a page and you know, this is also a time when I'm losing some of my friends, that's been difficult.  And--but I'm also seeing some of their children soar, which has been wonderful.  I love the way in which my daughter has blossomed, you know, she's been in a lot of different fields herself and then when she took on writing this book, as I said, with determination and focus that I didn't have, she seems to have, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there anything we need to discuss before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Woof, I said to myself, how can we do three hours.  Okay.  I can't think of it, you know, maybe like, can't think of it.  You've covered quite a bit.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, the last question, similar to legacy but a little different.  Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: How would I like to be remembered?  Oh, I guess someone who try to teach in a wide--lot of different ways versus a real teacher in a classroom.  Second, as a presenter of information on the media, third, as a presenter of a concept in a courtroom and then back into it again as someone who wanted to see other people continue a legacy of teaching through the Academy, hadn't thought about that, but I think that with a sense of humor and a purpose in that way and sense of I am continuing the legacy of my family as an educator.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
