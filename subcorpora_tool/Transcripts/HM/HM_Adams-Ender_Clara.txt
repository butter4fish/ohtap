Speaker 2: I was born on July 11th, 1939, in Willow Springs, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And we're going to sort, going back and see just how far back you can go within your family.  And of course, I've read that you can go pretty far back.  Now let's start on your mother's side, and then we will go to your father's [Otha Leach] side.  And we will--

Story_ID: 323431
Speaker 1: We're going to talk about your [maternal] grandfather Zedekiah [Zedekiah Sapp], but I first want to ask you, on your mother's [Caretha Sapp Leach] side, do you remember any stories that your mother may have told you that go back beyond your grandfather, maternal grandfather?
Speaker 2: No, I don't--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --remember any from my mother's side, but my father's [Otha Leach] side--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --I do, but not--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --from my mother's side.
Speaker 1: Well, let's, let's talk about a very interesting man in your life, your grandfather.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And he moved up from Jupiter [Florida]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --to North Carolina.
Speaker 2: To North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what year that was?
Speaker 2: I don't remember--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --exactly what year that was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I do remember that they were, they were migrant workers; that's really what they were at that time.  And they had heard down in Florida--down in Florida, of course they were, they were, where he was born, they were in, involved in the orchards and picking fruit and, and that type, and, and vegetables and that type of thing.  But they heard that to move up to North Carolina and to deal with tobacco was the place to be, and so that's what he did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He got married, and my grandmother [Farrie Bell Sapp] was fifteen at the time; I think he was like seventeen or eighteen.  And they got married and moved up to Raleigh, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Have you heard any stories from your grandmother or even from your grandfather of how they met?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, I don't.  If I did, I don't remember (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right.  Anyway, they, they moved up from Florida--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --with your mother--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and, and her siblings--
Speaker 2: Right, yes.
Speaker 1: --and to, to North, North Carolina.
Speaker 2: North Carolina, right, yes.
Speaker 1: Once that move was made, your grandfather was struck by sort of a wanderlust.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And will you tell us about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, as best I can remember his story to me, he had kind of had this dream all of his lifetime to travel and to go places and see a lot of things because he knew that that down in Florida, where he lived, that there was a wider world out there, and he hadn't see it.  And, and so he used to dream about the places that he'd go whenever he grew up.  But, of course, what he, what he did was, he got married quite young, and they had children quite young, and then he had to, of course, assume the responsibility of a family and, and doing those things that were necessary.  And that mean, meant that you had to get some immediate work and provide for your family, so that's what he was doing.  But when he got up to North Carolina and he found out about the amount of work that was necessary in tobacco and that type of thing, he started thinking about this dream that he had to travel, you know, from before.  And one day apparently he had a rather, rather rough time in the tobacco fields, because tobacco is, tobacco is hard work.
Speaker 1: Right, it is.
Speaker 2: And he, he had a rather rough time.  And when he came out of the fields that day, he said, according to his story, he just kept walking.  And he just kept, kept walking, and before he knew it he was, he had hopped a, a train and was on his way to Florida, back down to Florida.  And that's where he went initially, and then he became a Pullman porter and, and worked the train from Florida to California over the next few years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: But at the same time, of course, you know, he has a wife and ten or twelve children that are still at home, is still there.  And, and he didn't give a lot of thought to that, he said, and, and he admitted that he didn't give a lot of thought to it at that time.  He just decided that he needed to go and see what the rest of the world looked like, and so that's what he did.
Speaker 1: And a lot of these stories he would relate to your mother and others in the family, came from when he would simply come back home for a day or two, is that it, and then go again?
Speaker 2: No, he--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The first time left, he didn't come back for a good twenty or thirty years, you know.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Now I, I found out much later--when I really got into this situation I was about in graduate school by this time, but I found years later that he had written to my grandmother.  But she was not talking to him at all, so she never shared any information about the fact that he had talked about coming back and wanted to.  But she had not talked to any of the family about it, and even her children didn't know this--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --until much later, that had, that he had call--he had, had written and said that he wanted to come back, and she--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --would have none of it.
Story_ID: 323432
Speaker 1: During this period, your [maternal] grandmother [Farrie Bell Sapp] had these dozen children--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --to take care of--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and herself.  What did she did do?  What, what did, what did she relate to you or did your mother [Caretha Sapp Leach] relate to you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --how your grandmother took a care of these children--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I would--
Speaker 1: --and managed?
Speaker 2: --I will tell you this, my grandmother never told us anything about anything.  My mother related the story to us over time.  And she said that what they basically had to do was, they had to all stop school, many of them and my mother.  My mother left school in the sixth grade, and they all had to go to work because the family had to be provided for.  And they, and she and her old, her two oldest brothers and an older sister were the four that really had to go to work and to take charge of the family and to deal with the things that were necessary to get the money, monies to keep the family going.  The oldest--the second oldest brother, the second oldest son, because the oldest son was, was a bit mental retarded, and so they couldn't rely on him for too much work at all, but the second oldest one was, was my Uncle Ike [ph.], we use, we always called him.  And he really, really was angry at my grandfather [Zedekiah Sapp] for many years for having done that because he missed out on, he thought, a lot of his childhood because he had to grow up and be the, the, essentially the father in the family--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --was what he had to be at that time--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --to, to get the things done.
Speaker 1: Let's, let's put a timeline on this.  Approximately what year are we talking about the family moving up from Jupiter, Florida, to North Carolina, if you remember?
Speaker 2: Let me see, now I think my mother said she was about five or six years old at that time, so that'd be about the 1920s.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause she was born in 1915.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so, we're talking about initially moving up, and things were hard in the 1920s--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --when, of course, the Depression [Great Depression] came--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --in 1929, which meant you went from bad to worse economically.  And so that was even more difficult on your family--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --on, on, on your mother and, and her siblings and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and, and so forth.  The, were there conversations that you used to have with your maternal grandmother that would shed light on some of the difficulties they went through during those early or late '20s [1920s]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My, my grandmother--
Speaker 1: Was--
Speaker 2: --never talked about--
Speaker 1: --she was a strong woman, like most of the--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) She was--
Speaker 1: --Leach women.
Speaker 2: --she was (laughter), she was a very strong woman, but she was a very private person--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I mean very secretive kind of individual, really was; all of her lifetime she was that way.  And anything or any information that we managed to get came from my mother, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and my mother talked about the fact that it was very tough for them during this time, but they all, they lived on the farm.  That was the advantage of, of living on a farm.  They lived on the farm, and so they could raise--and they were sharecroppers, of course, but they could raise the food that they needed to eat, and that's the thing that kept them going--
Speaker 1: So they did not go--
Speaker 2: --in terms of food, right.
Speaker 1: --go hungry?
Speaker 2: No, no, did not go hungry.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right, yes.
Speaker 1: Now, what year did your grandmother pass?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: My, I, let me see--my grandfather died; I think it was 1988, I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My, let me see.  My grand--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Let me see--wait a minute--my, my mother died in '82 [1982]--no, it was 1983--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: --because she lived one year after my mother died.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother died in '82 [1982], and she died in '83 [1983], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What--
Speaker 2: And she was ninety-eight.
Speaker 1: Ninety-eight, God bless her.
Speaker 2: She was ninety-eight years old, yeah.
Speaker 1: She was a strong lady--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --physically and mentally.
Speaker 2: Without a doubt.
Story_ID: 323433
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your mother [Caretha Sapp Leach] now.  What are some of the stories that your mother related to you about her life prior to meeting your, your father [Otha Leach]?
Speaker 2: Well, much of it was that of going to work and doing work in, on the tobacco farm, you see, and going to school.  That's primarily all they did, was to go to work and go to school a bit.  She went to school until the sixth grade, and then after that time, of course, she went and, and went to work, but then to church; church was a big part of, of her life--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --during this period of time.  And she and my father went to different churches, but they had, they lived in, in pretty much the same community, but they went to different churches at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what church did your mother go to, your--
Speaker 2: My mother went to Juniper Level, J-U-N-I-P-E-R, L-E-V-E-L, Juniper Level Baptist Church [Juniper Level Missionary Baptist Church, Raleigh, North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in, in Raleigh [North Carolina].  It was on Raleigh Route--in the suburban Raleigh at that time, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so during that period it was all 80 percent work and 20 percent school and so forth (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You got it; that's correct.
Speaker 1: And, and well, allowing for church--
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: --all day on, on Sunday.
Speaker 2: --all day on Sunday, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, sometime during this period, and I guess we are talking about she would have been around fifteen or fourteen in, in 19- say '29 [1929] we're talking about--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --as we slipped into a depression [Great Depression] in this country.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: When, when did she meet your, your father?
Speaker 2: I think she was about fifteen or sixteen when she me my father.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they traveled, I guess, along the same, as I recall, along the same road together going to school--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because he and his brother, his oldest brother, and some cousins, some real characters that I have met over time, they all seem to have traveled along this same road going to school.  And so they could talk to one another both in the morning and in the afternoon, you see--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to see how things are, how things are going and to, and to talk about, you know, what was going on within the various families and everything.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And, and they--I get at--during this period of struck up a friendship, you know, with one another.  And sixteen--she was about fifteen I think when they, when they met, and they were married whenever she was eighteen, and he was twenty-one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, so--
Speaker 1: So we're talking about she was eighteen.  That would be about 1933 when they got married.
Speaker 2: That's right, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right, yes, 1933, yeah, was the year.
Speaker 1: They got married in 1933, and you were the fourth child of twelve siblings?
Speaker 2: Right--no, of ten.
Speaker 1: Of, of, of--
Speaker 2: Of ten, right.
Speaker 1: --of ten, right?
Speaker 2: Of ten in my family, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, right.  And I wanted to find out: so they met actually going back and forth to, to school?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: That's right--
Speaker 1: --so--
Speaker 2: --yes, and talking along the road, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And of course, you know, parents were really strict during this period of time.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I mean you didn't develop any relationships with anybody, not that anybody could see.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so, nobody ever knew that anything was going 'cause they were always with a crowd.  You see, they were always with a crowd there.  Coming up and down the road, they were always with a crowd at church, and so, because you know everybody to keep a watch on what was going on--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --during this time.  And there was no courtship at home, no visiting, no, no, no, none of that stuff (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) None of that.
Speaker 2: No, just up and down the road you--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --manage to talk and deal with--
Speaker 1: Has, has your mother ever talked to you--did your mother ever talk to you about what her first initial feelings were towards your father or what she thought--
Speaker 2: Oh, I guess--
Speaker 1: --they were toward it?
Speaker 2: Oh, they didn't like one another a lot.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: She was interested in his friend, his cousin.  And I met the cousin on several occasions, real characters; they both were real characters (laughter).  But the cousin was definitely a character, and she was interested in him for a long time.  And he, as a matter of fact, he was the one who really told her that, that my father was interested in her.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so he wasn't gonna stand in the way.  And, and, and so then she started to get interested in my father--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because see, he, his cousin just bowed out (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right, and she--the cousin made way for Mr. Five by Five.
Speaker 2: That's right (laughter).
Speaker 1: I certainly understand that.

Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They raised tobacco, and cotton, and corn, and, and soybeans and that type of--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --those types of, of, of things.  But the, the thing that--and, and that was different than my mother's background, because my mother and her, and, and her, her grand, my grandmother [Farrie Bell Sapp] and grandfather [Zedekiah Sapp] were sharecroppers.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But my father's folks all owned their land, you see.
Speaker 1: And so they were considered rich--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --relatively rich--
Speaker 2: Yeah, really--
Speaker 1: --in those--
Speaker 2: --really.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was--
Speaker 1: They were middle class.
Speaker 2: That's right, yeah, yeah because, you know, they grew tobacco, and so they, you know, they could manage fairly well.
Story_ID: 323436
Speaker 1: There was a situation that occurred when my father [Otha Leach], when my grandfather died.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: When he died, he left--
Speaker 2: This is when Handy [Handy Leach] died, right?
Speaker 1: No, no, this was when Vander [Vander Leach] died.
Speaker 2: Oh, Vander, Vander.
Speaker 1: So you remember when his--
Speaker 2: Vander, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Handy was the great-grandfather.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: This was when Vander died, he had gotten, he had gotten this land from his father, from his father.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: When he died, he left the property to his wife--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --who was Esther [Esther Rowland Leach], my grandmother.  And when she got the property, when she was willed the property, she never wanted to live on the farm anyway.  She want, she didn't, didn't want to do that so she sold her fifty acres that she had been willed and bought her a, and built her a house in town as a matter, yeah--
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: --built her house in the City of Raleigh [North Carolina].
Speaker 2: In the City of Raleigh.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so that's where she lived.
Speaker 2: And that's what--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --Esther did?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes, and that was really--my grandfa- my father was very sad about that because he alway- he, he really wanted to buy the property himself, but he couldn't afford it at that time because he, you know, had all these children.  And at this time it was about five of us, you know, altogether.  And he couldn't afford to buy that property, but he always wanted his own property.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But he couldn't afford to buy it, and so she--except for, you know, if he could pay for it every year.  And she wanted her money, cash money, right now, so she sold that property and, and built a house in town.  And he was really, he was really--
Speaker 2: Sad.
Speaker 1: --very saddened by that, you know--
Speaker 2: I can un--
Speaker 1: --the fact--
Speaker 2: I can understand.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the fact that that happened.  And you know, I used to hear him talk about it, because he just, he just always dreamed of being able to have his father's land.
Story_ID: 323437
Speaker 1: We were talking about Esther [Adams-Ender's paternal grandmother, Esther Rowland Leach] receiving fifty acres of land from her husband, Vander [Vander Leach].
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And your father [Otha Leach] being upset, of course, not having the means to purchase it himself or to give her cash--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and Esther moving to the city [Raleigh, North Carolina].
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: So, your father had to share, sharecrop land--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --and raise tobacco (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right.
Speaker 1: But he, he did very well.
Speaker 2: Yes, he did, yes.
Speaker 1: He was a smart businessman.
Speaker 2: He was.  He did very well out of all of that.  And we, there were large families, of course during this time so that they could work the fields.  I mean you, you had to have a lot of children in order to be able to get some free labor (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: --during this period.  And so, let me see, by the time my grandfather died, there were, he was at '42 [1942], yeah, so the mother and father had five children at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There were five of us that were--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that were around at that time.  But what my father did was he moved out of that neighborhood on Raleigh Route 3 and moved down to Willow Springs [North Carolina] which is a little bit further out of the, of the city than that, because he wanted to go with his wife and children and you know, stand on his own.  Not too long after that his oldest brother moved over near us too, and so we all grew up in the, in the same, in the same area.  During this period--
Speaker 1: And that older brother's name which--
Speaker 2: William [William Leach]--
Speaker 1: William--
Speaker 2: Uncle William.
Speaker 1: Uncle William--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --right.
Speaker 2: --yeah, Uncle William.  And Uncle William was very important in my life too.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so, but during this period of time, I'd love to give you a little bit of flavor of what the--
Speaker 1: Please.
Speaker 2: --country was like during that period--
Speaker 1: Please.
Speaker 2: --because we lived out in the country with no electricity and no running water, you know, and no inside plumbing in those--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and those kinds of things, so--
Speaker 1: And approximately what year are you going to relate to us, approxi- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm relating to you--
Speaker 1: --or--
Speaker 2: --probably about 1942, '43 [1943].
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --forty-three [1943], yeah, those years--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah.  I'm just coming up on four years old--
Speaker 1: Four years old--
Speaker 2: --you see, so I, and I can look around and see now pretty much what's going on because my sister had taught me to read when I was four.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And that--
Speaker 1: Your sister, Bettie [Bettie Leach].
Speaker 2: My sister, Bettie, my oldest sister Bettie, to whom I shall be eternally grateful because she taught me to read at a very young age.  And when you can read, you can get into a lot of things.
Speaker 1: You're free.
Speaker 2: You can learn a lot of things.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I've learned; I found that out.  And, and so I knew all about the fact that we had no plumbing, and we had no electricity.  And I knew also the fact that since I had to start doing chores at that time around the farm, because my father said everybody's gotta carry your own weight--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you see, and I had started doing chores, I knew that there were animals around, and, and there were things that people had to do.  And my two greatest chores, of course, was milking the cow and cleaning the outhouse, neither of which I thought were two very good chores at all (laughter).  I never liked any of that, but I did what I had to do.  I, and I tell people these days that in those times you did what your parents said for you to do.  I mean you didn't, you didn't talk back, you did--or else you'd find yourself getting up off the floor--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --or you'd get a backhand lick, and you wouldn't know where you'd gone, you see.  So, we did that, and, and I remember that those things, times were not easy in those places--
Story_ID: 323438
Speaker 1: But the thing that happened on, on a farm, I think that we had an advantage on a farm, even sharecropping, because you always got a plot of land to use to plant your garden.  And as a matter of fact, folks that we sharecroppers with, the landlord always gave us a plot of land to plant.  And we planted the garden, and so we grew all of the food that we ate.
Speaker 2: And you did not have to share that with the--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --owner.
Speaker 1: No, no, did not have to share that at all.  All of that was our food.  And so we would plant the vegetables, and, and we had fruit trees around and everything in the summertime.  And then when the wintertime came, of course we'd have the dried beans and peas; and we'd have sweet potatoes because we put those in a hill, and they stayed in that place.  And, and we just, and we had, we had food all of the time.  I will tell you that I at that time did not know that we were poor people.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: I didn't know that we were poor people because I equated being poor to being hungry.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And I will tell you, I was never hungry.  Now I may not have had always the food I wanted to eat, but I always had food because my mother [Caretha Sapp Leach] had chickens.  And we could just go right out on the yard and just get a chicken, and we could have fried chicken and, and boiled chicken or stewed chicken or whatever with that.  And my father [Otha Leach] raised pigs, and he had cows.  And so we got the milk and then we had cows that if we needed to slaughter a cow, you could do that.  And we slaughtered pigs always in November.  In the wintertime it was hog-killing time, so there was always food there, you see.  And so I always said we, we always had food.  And mother would say some things like: you can't have a new doll because your sister needs a pair of shoes.  And, and maybe I should have gotten an idea that money was not as plentiful as it could have been, but I didn't need very much else.  You know, I got everything that I needed 'cause that time it was just as important to have food, clothing, and shelter--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --for me, yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And, and plus, you cannot apply yesterday's standards to today's standards.
Speaker 1: That's right, yes.
Speaker 2: Because you had an outhouse did not--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --mean you did not have means--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --or that you went hungry--
Speaker 1: Yes, yes--
Speaker 2: --and, and so forth.
Speaker 1: --that's true.
Speaker 2: Now--
Story_ID: 323439
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) When your father [Otha Leach] moved from Route 3 [Raleigh Route 3] down to Willow Springs [North Carolina]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --how many acres did he sharecrop that time?
Speaker 2: We probably did about fifty.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, because--
Speaker 1: So you--
Speaker 2: --twelve or so acres in tobacco and then five--no, about ten or twelve acres in cotton, and then he had corn and soybeans and those things--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --are kinds of things that he grew.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so we had about fifty acres.
Speaker 1: And explain this for people who don't understand sharecropping.  And there are some, believe it or not, and--
Speaker 2: I know it is.
Speaker 1: --and what that meant.  It meant that your father did all the work of farming and bringing in that crop.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And he had to share a portion of that crop--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --with the owner--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --who I think was--
Speaker 2: Yeh.
Speaker 1: --Mr. Lipscomb.
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Bud Lipscomb--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And go ahead.
Speaker 2: And, and what, the, the sharing was the owner of the land got 50 percent of the earnings from the crops that you raised.  Now see, that's the thing that makes it be called sharecropping, but it's not exactly 50/50 because his 50 [percent] is all clear.  Your 50 [percent] means that you've got to pay all of the monies for your fertilizer and all of those things that you--
Speaker 1: Seed.
Speaker 2: --have--yeah, seeds and, and everything that you have used all year to plant the crops.  That's what you gotta pay.  You gotta pay your 50 [percent]--you gotta pay for those things out of your 50 percent.  His 50 percent is already come off the top, you see.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so, therefore, it's sharing, but it's not quite 50/50 (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: I found it interesting because in President Carter's [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] book, he was a, he was the landlord's son.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so he explained this whole situation (laughter) so that people could understand it.  It's very interesting, yep.
Speaker 1: It is very interesting.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I sent him a copy of my book ['My Rise to the Stars: How a Sharecropper's Daughter Became an Army General,' Clara Adams-Ender], as a matter of fact, so he'd know the other side of the story (laughter).
Speaker 1: Absolutely, ab- absolutely.  Well, the rules are made by those that call the tune, you know.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He who has the gold rules (laughter).
Speaker 1: Rules, that's right.
Story_ID: 323440
Speaker 1: Now, you're four years old.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now you're learning to read.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And this new world is opening up to you.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: And your father [Otha Leach] is very proud of you.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes--
Speaker 1: And what was it like--
Speaker 2: --he was--
Speaker 1: --there at home?
Speaker 2: --yeah.  Well, my dad, my dad, as, as, as long as I have really knowledge of my father, he and I had a, had a different kind of relationship.  And much of it had to do with the fact that I was kind of not the conventional kind of kid during those times, in that I just always had to ask why, you know, and not only why, but just kind of dig in and find out what's going on and ask a lot of questions about a lot of things.  And, and especially after I learned how to read, there were a lot, there was a lot of things that I didn't know about, but I could see them, and we could, we could deal with them, and I could talk about them, and I'd always ask questions about them.  And, and I think sometimes he'd get irritated because he didn't know the answers to the questions.  But I think he really liked the fact that I was a curious kind of person and didn't just accept things at face value all of the time simply because he said it, you see.  But I was not, I was never disrespectful, as far as my, my folks were concerned, because you know you'd get punished for being disrespectful.  But I was always questioning, and, and I'm still that person until today.  I used to say that I did it because I have a natural curiosity.  Later on, I just decided I'm just plain nosy; that's basically what I am (laughter).  And so, as a result of that, I'm always looking and asking people about what's going on, and, and, and, and they will indeed deal with me.  So I had a special relationship with him because I'd come and I'd bring my books, and I'd say, daddy, I'd love to read this book to you.  Here's what I learned today, and then he'd take me up on his lap.  And I'd sit on his lap, and I'd read this book.  And he'd just sit there smile and beam because he was very proud of the fact that I could read, and you know that was a big thing in the neighborhood [in Willow Springs, North Carolina].
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: You know, here's a four-year-old able to read (laughter), you know.  And, and so it, it was, it was always--and I, so I'd follow him around, you know, because he always did, I thought, I thought at that time, I was, I was much more interested in what men did than what women did because I will tell you, cleaning house was not one of those things I had wanted to be involved in and, and still don't.  And so, I thought, but following my father around, I thought that was really great, because we would go all sorts of places and do all kinds of things.  And as a result of that, we were--I mean I was able to learn about everything that was going on outside of the house.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I didn't think too much was going on the inside anyway, so, except for my books (laughter).  And so, but I could find out a lot of things outside, and so that's why I followed my father around a lot.
Story_ID: 323441
Speaker 1: During that period, you still have uncles, Uncle William [William Leach]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and let's see, your, you have another uncle that--
Speaker 2: Ike [ph.].
Speaker 1: Ike.
Speaker 2: He's my father's--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --my mother's [Caretha Sapp Leach] brother, yeah.
Speaker 1: And, and they, they have these two fifty-acre parcels [sic.] not--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --too far from you.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: They're near Raleigh [North Carolina].
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: What kind of contact was maintained between the three families?
Speaker 2: Yeah, now, my, my father's uncles [Hubert Leach and James Leach] were the ones who got the property, you know, from the other--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: My, my Uncle William and Uncle Ike were both sharecropping at that time.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were both sharecropping--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --during that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But they lived not too far from us.  And so we would, we would all get together at various periods.  As a matter of fact, they, we talked on a weekly basis 'cause we all went to church together.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: See, on first Sunday was my mother's church at Juniper Level [Juniper Level Baptist Church; Juniper Level Missionary Baptist Church, Raleigh, North Carolina], and on third Sunday was my father's church at St. Anna [St. Anna Free Will Baptist Church, Raleigh, North Carolina].  And so and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and, and so we all got together at both those churches 'cause they visited back and forth with, from the churches--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --so that we got together quite often. And if we had a rush, and this is what people did in the, in the country and, and at that period of time, I have often told people that the value at that time and the ethic in the country for country people, didn't matter what color you were, was that you worked.  If you didn't work, it didn't matter who you were or what color you were, you were not valued because the community needed all the help it could get and all of the people that it could get to work with and for them during--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that period.  So it was, it was very important that you learned a good work ethic and be able to, to keep that going because you could make a lot more money that way in doing that.  So my uncle and, my Uncle William and my Uncle Ike, at sometimes, whenever we needed help on our farm, they would come over and help us, and then we would go over and help them.  And it was never any money passed back and forth.  This is, you know, just did what you had to do in order to keep everybody going--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --so that everybody could be productive in what it was that they were, they were about doing it.
Speaker 1: And that's what family was about--
Speaker 2: That's right: that's what family--
Speaker 1: --okay.
Speaker 2: --that's what family did.  And--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My uncle, William had three children, and, and they were well-spaced, so he only had one or two around at any point in time.  But my Uncle Ike had twelve children, you see, and we, whenever they came over to stay with us sometimes, and we used to have a lot of fun.  The children used to have a great time because the adults, I guess they worked out what it was that they did.  But we all, you know, these houses weren't too big.  Now these houses, even though there were ten or twelve people in these houses, we're talking about like a three-bedroom house, you see: one bedroom for mother and father; one bedroom for the boys, and one for the girls, you see (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And those could not get in the bed had to do pallets on the floor, 'cause that's what, you know, what you did in those houses.  Well, when we got twenty-two of us in there, of course, everybody had to do their thing, and of course, we'd get into pillow fights and do all the other. We'd do all the things that children did and have a marvelous time doing it (laughter).
Speaker 1: So this is when one family would visit the other.
Speaker 2: That's right (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And they would--
Speaker 2: --to come in and--
Speaker 1: --spend, spend over, Saturday or a Friday--
Speaker 2: Right, over--
Speaker 1: --or a Saturday, over--
Speaker 2: Yeah, a Sunday--
Speaker 1: --over the weekend.
Speaker 2: --Sunday night mostly because, you see, Monday, we're all going to work together, you see, because they're gonna help us out, you know, for one day, you see.  And so they'd come in on Sunday night, and, and they'd bring their work clothes and everything.  And we, on Sunday night we'd go to church or we'd do something there at home.  And then Monday, we'd all go to the field and work all day together.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And your mother, if they were visiting you, would prepare--
Speaker 2: She--
Speaker 1: --a meal for all--
Speaker 2: --that's right, for--
Speaker 1: --for all twenty-two.
Speaker 2: --eh, all the twenty-two people, and she had pots big enough to be able to manage that too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: That sounds like a, a lot of fun.
Speaker 2: It was.
Story_ID: 323442
Speaker 1: During this period, you are now growing up--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and getting, going off to school.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And that first day of elementary school, do you remember what it was like for you for, for--
Speaker 2: Elementary school was--
Speaker 1: --for preschool, I guess you would call it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, actually first grade was a little bit boring, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And first grade was boring because I'd already done first grade.  As a matter of fact, I was reading at the fifth grade level because my sister Bettie [Bettie Leach] was in the fifth grade, and she always taught me wherever year she was, she would teach me everything because she's five years older than I am.  And so--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --I was reading at the fifth grade level.  Well, I was just, you know, when I got to see Jane--see Dick run and see Jane do whatever, I said oh my God, I did this years ago.  And so, the, the first grade teacher was very kind.  She was, she noted that, you know, I could do this reading, and there was no problem.  And, and then, of course, when I didn't have anything to do, I'd get into mischief (laughter), which is what a six-year-old ought to do.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So she got the principal and brought the principal to her room and said, "I have a student there that can read at the fifth grade level."  And he said no, she can't; I don't think that's possible.  So she, he, she brought me to the office and he said, "Okay, read to me out of this book," and so I read (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what was his name, Mr.--
Speaker 2: Mr. Davis [ph.].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I said--he said, "Read to me out of this book," so I read to him out of the book.  And it was a fifth grade book.  And he said, "Oh, that's very good."  He said, "I know kids in the fifth grade that can't read as well as you."  So, he said let's go down to this fifth grade and read with this bunch.  So he--I went down, and I read at the fifth grade level.  And of course, you know, those kids in that room didn't, didn't like this at all, that--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --that this little upstart's come down here--
Speaker 1: Showoff.
Speaker 2: --to read (laughter).  But I went ahead and did what I needed to do, and that kept me from being bored, 'cause at least I can get around and do some other things, yeah.
Speaker 1: And because you were not bored, you would, stayed out of trouble.
Speaker 2: That's right. I stayed out of trouble, yes, indeed.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And then I got moved on to the second grade and stayed the rest of that year, so I really just kind of skipped first grade--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, 'cause I only did--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --about a half a semester in there, and then I went on to second grade.  And so, I graduated high school [Fuquay Springs Consolidated High School, Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina] when I was sixteen because I was all finished with all those things--
Story_ID: 323443
Speaker 1: Now during this period, at any one time, how many of your brothers and sisters were in school?  Because you had all of the grades right there together from elementary to (simultaneous) --
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, that's right.
Speaker 1: --high school [Fuquay Springs Consolidated High School, Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina].
Speaker 2: That's right, yeah.
Speaker 1: How many of your brothers and sisters were in school with you at any one period?
Speaker 2: At any one time, there was usually about six of us there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay, so the Leach--
Speaker 2: --yeah.
Speaker 1: --family could really take over the school--
Speaker 2: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: --schoolyard.
Speaker 2: Yes, indeed, and everybody always talked about the, that Leach family, because there we were known as people who worked, you see, in the community.  And I can tell you from the beginning, my mother [Caretha Sapp Leach] and father [Otha Leach] always talk--told us a couple of things.  One, you are somebody, and never let any--hang around with anybody who tells you that you're not, you see.  So, so, I was a pretty confidant person whenever I left home--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you see.  You know, self-esteem was, was very important to me, because they said that's the way you're supposed to feel about yourself.  And the second thing was, you can do or be anything you want to be, or do, if you're willing to work hard and never give up, you see.  They always added never give up.
Speaker 1: Never give up.
Speaker 2: And I, I kind of carried that with me all of my life.  And I still say that that probably got me going very well in this life because I just, you know, I just wouldn't give up.  You know, I just--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --just seemed like I needed to keep at it for a while, and, and, and it seemed to have come out all right after a bit.
Speaker 1: Now, it seems that you come from a long line of very strong women personalities, your great-grandmother, your mother and so forth.  And your mother was a force there in the home without letting your (laughter) father know it--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --or bragging about it.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And tell us about some of those instances.  You know, your mother would talk to you about philosophy, a life--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --a life philosophy--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --but she had also gave you other guidance--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --in, in there.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did she do that with all of the children, or do you think she made a special effort to guide you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --because you were exceptionally gifted?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, I think I needed some special guidance (laughter).  But she really talked to all of us, and she really tried to teach us all about the same thing, because, for example, she taught my brothers to cook 'cause, she said because whenever you grow up, you need to be free to make the choices you need to make.  And if you don't know how to do these things, if you don't know how to cook, wash your own clothes, and do your ironing, you are apt to mit- make decisions be, based on things other than that, based on the things for the fact that you need to have somebody to wash and iron and cook for you.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: She said when you know how to do that for yourself you can make different kinds of decisions.  And I'll tell you, those boys said that was absolutely quite true.  But she was, she was a person that left school in the sixth grade but had basic common sense that she could tell you about any day of the week.  And I always appreciated her, and my older sister too.  And she, we were all there at the same, we were all--she had, my older sister and I, of course, were there at the same time, and she would be talking to us mostly because my, my, my next sister--
Speaker 1: When you refer to your older sister, you were talking about Bettie [Bettie Leach]?
Speaker 2: Talking about Bettie, yeah, yes--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --my older sister Bettie.  She and I were mostly with mother, during this period, because we had to do the things as far as the house was concerned, you know, the washing, the ironing, the, the, and, and to wash and iron for six, seven, eight kids going to school at once was a big deal--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --forever.  And I had, I had to do, I had to, was assigned the chore to do the ironing, you see.  I don't iron 'til today.  Because you, when you start out and you look at what you have to have for these children to go to school, you've got to get the five dresses for each person, and that's four girls going to school.  You've got to get the trousers for the boys, and at that time you didn't wear anything rough-dried.  You, your jeans and all that business, you did a little ironing on so that you looked pressed--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --when you went out to school.  I mean it was a lot, it was a lot of work that had to be taken care of.
Story_ID: 323444
Speaker 1: You mention in your book ['My Rise to the Stars: How a Sharecropper's Daughter Became an Army General,' Clara Adams-Ender] about the need for flower sacks and other types of sacks that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --come from the general store.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Tell us about the dresses in your family that came from those general store--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --sacks.
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, these were, were sacks that had grain in it or fertilizer and things of that nature.  And what would happen was the, the grain store would get these sacks, and all of the times they wouldn't be the same material.  But they were, they were flowered because they found that the women used those bags to, to make dresses and to make shirts and to do these things later on.  And so, you got an added benefit whenever you bought these particular ones.  Robinson's I can remember, Robinson's fertilizer.  I (laughter), I could remember where, very well because mother [Caretha Sapp Leach] used to boil her, her sacks before she used them.  And so, she ball--boil them, and then the dye that had the lettering, you see, was out of the sack, and so you only had the white muslin sack left after that time.  It was really quite nice.  And she used that to make shorts and undershorts and those things for my brothers.  But the, the flowered sacks and the brightly colored and plaid and all of those kinds of things came, the fertilizer came in those or the feed.  And you could use those to make nice dresses.  But you had to make sure, of course, should you had two or three so that you could put 'em all together (laughter).  And I used to have to go with my father [Otha Leach] to pick up his fertilizer so he'd made sure he got the right sacks--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --so we could get the four yards that we needed in order to make, with four yards of material to make the, the dresses that we needed at various times.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, now and we're still in the '30s [1930s], right--well, no, we're, we're in the--
Speaker 2: No, we're in the, we're in the '40s [1940s].
Speaker 1: No, we're in the '40s [1940s] now.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we're--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --in the '40s [1940s], right.
Speaker 1: Can we just go back to the '30s [1930s] for a hot minute.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And when your mother would do a lot of this sewing.  Did, did she do it on a sewing machine, or did she do the sewing by hand?
Speaker 2: By hand in the beginning.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She did by hand initially, but then she bought a, an old Singer [Singer Corporation; Singer Sewing Company] sewing machine, and the treadle kind, you know, with the pedal down at your bottom.  And you had to, you had to turn the top, and then once you got it going, you could--which is, oh, it was great exercise, yeah.  And she used that to do her--to make the dresses and to do those things.
Speaker 1: And to make the underwear--
Speaker 2: And to make the underwear, and to do, and to do all that.  And then she could make a lot more.
Story_ID: 323445
Speaker 1: Plus at the same time, Bettie [Adams-Ender's older sister, Bettie Leach] was in high school, and she was able to take home economics because at that time you had home economics and agriculture at the schools.  And you had to take those 'cause that's what people were being involved in.  I think, I think at that time we, we did a lot more practical stuff in, in high schools and so forth because it was an agrarian society.  And most everybody was going to leave high school and go to the farm--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you see.  That's what we did--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you see, and during that.  And so as a result of that, they taught those kinds of courses.  As a matter of fact, they tried to do a number of things to help the, the, the farming communities.  The schools would run canneries, you know, and we'd can meat and vegetables and all of those things so that we could put it away for the winter so that you could have your food and everything for the wintertime, yeah.
Speaker 2: Right--
Speaker 1: So that's how--
Speaker 2: --right.
Speaker 1: --we worked out (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now when you say canneries, are you taking about the metal cans, or are--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you talking about--
Speaker 1: I'm talking the metal.
Speaker 2: --may, not mason jars.
Speaker 1: No, no, I'm talking about the metal cans.
Speaker 2: Metal cans.
Speaker 1: The mason jars they did in the home.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But they could take the meats, especially the meat, to the canneries.  And of course, they could put the meat inside the cans, and then it would cook it as you were going through the, through the line and everything.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so then they could get the meat all canned and didn't have to buy it.  We seldom went to the grocery store for anything--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --you see, because of the fact that we put away all of our food.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you would take the meat to the cannery--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and they would can it for you.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And you would pay them--
Speaker 1: And then--
Speaker 2: --for canning it--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: -and bring it back home.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: Well, did you ever pay them in terms of additional meat products, or it always had to be money or cash?
Speaker 1: Hey, sometimes you could do a trade.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You're right (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes, indeed, you could do a trade. And you know, I was just thinking about Mr. Burton [ph.] was the agricultural, the agri- 'cause the teacher who taught agriculture there at our school and of course set up the cannery (unclear).  He lived to the ripe old age of ninety-five.
Speaker 2: No kidding.
Speaker 1: Yes, he did; just died a few years ago, not many years ago.  And, and, but he was a very active man, and he, and he worked with thru- the boys, my brothers and everything.  I remember them all working in agriculture and making sure he said, because, you know, you, you, you may not be here all the time doing this, but you need to know this well in case you have to come back to it, you see.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And some of, some of those kids never left, you see.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: My brothers and sisters and I all, all went away because we either went to college, or my brother joined the [U.S.] Air Force, and one joined the, the [U.S.] Navy.  But we, we all left at some point, but many of those kids are still down there, never even left that home.
Story_ID: 323112
Speaker 1: Everybody is amazed by the, your reading ability and how smart you are.  But you also had a penchant for being a tomboy, right?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, oh yes.
Speaker 1: And those, those years when you were a tomboy, what did you like to do?  What were some of the things?
Speaker 2: I liked to do whatever my brother Raymond [Raymond Leach] did.  That was the thing.  You know, my brother Ray, Raymond and I were, we're thirteen months apart in age, and we were two close people in the family.  Now, I say we were two close people because we fought all of the time, but nobody could fight with us.  You see, if anybody fought with us, then--but mother [Caretha Sapp Leach] said, "Oh goodness, you'll drive me gray, crazy, and send me to an early grave.  Why don't you just leave one another?"  Well, we didn't do that.  And, and then I thought it was important to do whatever Raymond did.  And so we, he played baseball, and I played baseball, baseball.  And I almost didn't make the team because my older brother, Aaron [Aaron Leach], said we can't have any girls on this time, and Ray, you've said, "Now wait a minute, wait a minute.  He said let's see what she can do.  And if she can play baseball, if she can do this, then I think we ought to have her on the team.  But if she can't play, then we have to tell her she can't play, and we'll have to go."
Speaker 1: Now was this a Leach family team or, or your school--
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: --team?
Speaker 2: --no, it was, it was the neighborhood team.
Speaker 1: Team, okay.
Speaker 2: Right, neighborhood, 'cause there were some boys from up the street, and there were no girls, the other girls who would come out there, you know, because the other boys would tell their sisters you can't come out--'cause these are only boys playing.  But I managed to get on the team because Ray kind of negotiated with my brother, oldest brother, Aaron, and, and I made the team.  Well, of course, since I got on the team I wasn't gonna let him down, so I played on the team, and it worked out very well; I mean I had a marvelous time.  And I did that.  I guess I must have started when I was about eight or nine, and I played until I was twelve.  And then mother started talking about the fact that you're getting to be a young lady and all.  I didn't understand any of that, but I couldn't play anymore, you know; I had to leave the team, but we had a marvelous time doing that.  And I'd jump out the hayloft.  I did whatever they did, you know, except the muddy creek.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now I could not go in the water where I could not see my feet.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And therefore, I don't swim very well until today (laughter) because I didn't learn it when I should have.  But they all jumped in the muddy creek and did all of that stuff, and I never did that.  I couldn't--
Speaker 1: Did Ray ever challenge you to go in?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, he did, but I wasn't going.  I said when you--when that water's clear enough where you see my feet, I'll go.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But otherwise, I am not going in (unclear), and so I didn't do that.  But I'd bring down--we had watermelon, you know, at that time.  And the great thing to do was to bring a watermelon out of the hot sun and put it in the creek, and let that cold water run over it.  And then just crack it on the, on the side of the, on the bank and pull the heart out, 'cause the heart's the middle portion; pull the heart out and eat it.  Oh, that was wonderful.  Yeah, we used to do that and went to--so I did everything they did.
Story_ID: 323113
Speaker 1: And, and at the same time, my [paternal] uncle, William [William Leach], because I had learned to read, he thought that was just great, and so he used to give me these little poems to say, you see.  And so, but he would give 'em to all of us, you see, 'cause on children's day you had to go to the church, and you had to do your, your great thing at the church.  And all the children had a little poem.  And so, I'd learn my poem, and then I'd learn Ray's poem, Raymond's [Raymond Leach] poem because he was never gonna remember his poem.  And he would stand up, and it was funny because they would be--any of them; I'd know all of them.  Any of them would be standing up saying their poems.  Most of my other brothers and sisters could remember theirs, but Ray could never remember.  And he'd get up there and then he'd say, "What am I supposed to say now, Clara Mae [HistoryMaker General Clara Adams-Ender]?"  And so (laughter), and then I'd tell him his lines.  And the church it was funny; I mean they would all be laughing.  And he'd--and then they'd give him, clap and give him a big hand--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --because he finished it and everything.  Well, my uncle was teaching us and he--
Speaker 2: This is Uncle William?
Speaker 1: Uncle William, Uncle William was great, and I am grateful to Uncle William 'til today because he would always say stand up straight and speak loudly, because when you stand up straight and you speak loudly, nobody can misunderstand you.  And I always remembered that because in, when I got in high school [Fuquay Springs Consolidated High School, Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina] I started doing public speaking for, for the 4-H club and, and, and for the agricultural extension agency and those things.  And I rather enjoyed that, and, and, and I liked that a lot, and I still speak a lot until today.  But every time I get up to speak, I think about Uncle William because he always said stand up straight, speak loudly, and nobody can misunderstand you.  And I have had people to try and misunderstand me, but it wasn't because they didn't hear what I said (laughter).
Speaker 2: But because they didn't like what you said.
Speaker 1: That's right; you got it.  (Laughter) That's the reason I'll go, so that--and, and I was always grateful to him for that, because it's very important to be able to read and to--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and to be able to understand how to do it.  But it's also important to be able to speak well--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --and to be able to express yourself very well.
Speaker 2: Ab--
Speaker 1: And he sure did teach me how to do that--
Story_ID: 323114
Speaker 1: Now we're coming into 1951, '52 [1952].  And--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you're twelve going on thirteen years old.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah,
Speaker 1: Bettie [Adams-Ender's older sister, Bettie Leach] is just about ready.  Now she's taught you for every grade--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --all the way through high school.
Speaker 2: That's right, yeah.
Speaker 1: And she's ready to go off to college.
Speaker 2: She's going off to college.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And your father [Otha Leach] had--
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: --something to day, and your mother [Caretha Sapp Leach] had something to say.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) My father always had something to say, because my father belonged to this group that I called the boys.  And they all gathered around --these were a group of farmers who gathered around the country store.  And they got together and they talked about--which I learned later was gossip--about their families.  And they talked about their crops, and they talked about how things were going and all those kinds of things.  But they--
Speaker 1: They were white and black mixed--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --right?
Speaker 2: Yes, they were white and black--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --all standing around the store chewing tobacco, smoking, doing that stuff, 'cause my dad didn't smoke very much except for a cigar, but he chewed tobacco all of the time.  And so they would get together and they say well, when Bettie was getting ready to graduate from high school she expressed the fact that she wanted to go to college.  And so my mother said, "Oh, child, I think that's great," she said.  'Cause my mother always thought it was important to get the girls educated because she said you will do much better in this life if you have your education.  And they thought that all of them ought to be educated, but mother was especially interested in the girls going.  And as a matter of fact, we were the first ones who went off to college.  So Bettie went off.  Bettie was getting ready to go off, and daddy would come back from his grocery store, from the grocery store with the boys, and then he'd tell about what they talked about.  And so he said this particular day to mother, he said: "You know, they said up there today that Bettie doesn't need to go off to college because all she's gonna do is get married and have babies."
Story_ID: 323115
Speaker 1: So your father [Otha Leach] has come home now from the--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --general store.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And we--he, he's talking.  He's found out that--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Bettie [Adams-Ender's older sister, Bettie Leach] is interested in going to college.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But the boys don't approve.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, so he came up with the pronouncement from the boys that wasn't, wouldn't do any good to send her off to college because the only thing she was gonna do was grow up and get married and have babies.  And my mother [Caretha Sapp Leach], my mother was a very soft-spoken woman, and she seldom got upset about anything.  But when she put her hands on her hips and said, "Otha (laughter), my daughter wants to go to college.  And if she grows up and have babies, then so be it.  But if she wants to go to college, she's going to college."  And that was it.
Speaker 1: Your father never spoke about it again?
Speaker 2: Never spoke about it again, just went about trying to make sure that he got the money so that Bettie could get off to college (laughter).
Story_ID: 323116
Speaker 1: Let's set the scene for that period with a--the sharecropper was Mr. Lipscomb [Bud Lipscomb].
Speaker 2: Right, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, what kind of man was Mr. Lipscomb?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I always thought--and, and, and he was around us for a very long time.  We stayed on his farm longer than any other place, before dad finally bought it, bought a farm.  He was a very kind man.  He was very kind to us.  We, we worked the farm very well.  And, and he would come periodically and work in the fields.  And he'd come and bring his son to work in the fields.  But as I said before, work was the, was the main thing you had to do.  You had to have a good work ethic.  If you didn't, he, I've seen his stroll his own son out of the fields because he wasn't doing what he should do, and so it was important.  And he would come out to work with us, and we worked together, white farmers, black farmers, everybody got together to deal with the crops that was on his farm.  He must have had, as I, as I know about it now, probably two, three hundred acres--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --of property--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that he had.  And so he had several flar- farmers, sharecroppers around, you know, that lived on various portions of the farm.  And we all lived together--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and, and often worked together to get the, get the work done, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, to get the crop out (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, to get the crops taken care of.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: He, I found out later, and only because of the fact that we could smell it sometimes, but he probably was, drank a lot, you know, 'cause he would come to us sometimes, and, and it was really very interesting because I just noticed it on some days.  And some days it'd be very warm when we were, we were curing the tobacco and tying it up and getting it ready for market, and he would come in.  But he would be just dripping with sweat all over, you know.  And my mother [Caretha Sapp Leach] and father [Otha Leach] would just, you know, kind of make some statement or something when he left, but they, they never said anything too very much, 'cause they never talked about people very much at all.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But I found out later on that he probably kind of boozed it up a little bit--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --in his time, but he was a nice fellow.
Story_ID: 323117
Speaker 1: Set the scene for the general store now.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: There, you had someone who provided credit when you needed credit for mainstays and so forth.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: In addition to it being that meeting place--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --for the boys--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the, the fellow that owned the general store, his name was Walter, W-A-L-T-E-R, Myatt, M-Y-A-T-T [Walter Myatt].  And he not only owned the general store, but he had a business that was going on at that time too, and I can't remember what it--did he have the feed store?  I think he may have had a feed store at that time because he had, he had the grocery store, but then I think he had a feed store, was the other store that he had.  And what he would do often, especially for my father [Otha Leach] he did this I can remember and must indeed be grateful to him for it, he would lend him money during those times before the crops got in so that he could do some of the things that he needed to do.  And when my father got the crops in and started to sell the crops and do that type of thing, then he would pay him the money back.  I remember when Bettie [Adams-Ender's older sister, Bettie Leach] was getting ready to go off to college.  He needed, daddy needed a large sum of money at the time in order to be able to pay her first initial bill.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so he would borrow the money from Mr. Myatt.  And whenever he got his, sold the tobacco and so forth then he'd go and pay him the money back.
Speaker 1: Pay him back.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he did that for several of us going off to, off to school.  He did mine initially, and then after that time, of course, I worked and then was able to, to support myself.  And then I joined the [U.S.] Army, and of course, the Army took care of me after that time, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it was, it was a, it was a good relationship I believe.  I don't know, now I can't tell you exactly what they did in terms of the interest and all that type of thing.  But I know he had this green ledger that he used to keep, and they'd have the monies down in.  And as daddy paid him the money back, he would, you know, write out the portion of the ledger, and, and it all came out, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Very honest man, because I don't remember, I don't remember having any difficulty.  I don't remember anybody having any difficulties with him, any of the, the African Americans in the neighborhood having any difficulty with him saying that he cheated them or anything.  And other folks were not so, so righteous, you know.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: But he was very good, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 323118
Speaker 1: Bettie [Adams-Ender's older sister, Bettie Leach] went off to college?
Speaker 2: Bettie went off to college.
Speaker 1: Where did she go?
Speaker 2: And Bettie went to, at that time, North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State--College [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina], it was at that time, A and T College.  It's now a university, but at that time it was a college.  And she went off there to study English.  She wanted to be an English teacher, and, and she did.  She got to be an English teacher, did English and reading.  And I told her I was her best subject and (laughter).  And so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And her best student.
Speaker 2: --there when she was a teacher for forty, she taught teach--reading and English for forty-five years, yes, indeed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Had a wonderful time doing it.  And she went off to college, and we would go up to visit.  And those were great times for me because my job in doing this was to read the map and tell daddy [Otha Leach] where he had to go, you see.  And, and I, so that, therefore, I got to sit in the front seat with, with he and mother [Caretha Sapp Leach], and I had a lot of room up there.  You see, I could do all sorts of things.  And, and everybody else had to sit in the back, you see, because they, and they were kind of scrunched up back there 'cause it was a lot more of them back there than it was with me in the front seat.  So, I would do that, but I always liked to get up and see big buildings and all the places with all the books in them and everything, and see these sophisticated students who were in the college and learning all sorts of things and so on.  And then Bettie, of course, after she was there a short period of time, she made friends.  And then I could talk to her and friends and do those kinds of things.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what kind of car did your father have at that time?
Speaker 2: My father never drove anything during this period but Fords.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So he had a Ford, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This was 1954, so he must have had about a '50 [1950] Ford, 'cause he was usually--but I never, I never na- I've never known my father to own a new car, ever.  I don't believe he ever bought a new car, but he always had good cars.  You know, it wasn't no more than three or four years old, but it was never, it was never a new one.  I don't think he ever bought a new car, yeah, each time.  I don't remember him having one.
Story_ID: 323119
Speaker 1: Bettie [Adams-Ender's older sister, Bettie Leach] is gone off to college [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You're still in high school [Fuquay Springs Consolidated High School, Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina].
Speaker 2: Right, I'm in high school--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --yeah.
Speaker 1: --you're beginning to notice teachers and boys and, and so forth there in high school.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What was it like?
Speaker 2: Well, it was kind of different for me, you see, because I was normally a tomboy and you know, hated boys for anything except for to play ball with them and, and to, and to talk about the scores and do those kinds of things because I found out that it was very easy to deal with boys; I mean girls were a little bit temperamental.  But it was easy to deal with boys because they only dealt with one thing mostly.  And that was what they wanted to know as far as their sports was concerned, and do their sports, and go to the sports games and do those kinds of things.  And, and so, and, and I would listen to sports on, on the television 'cause we're getting to in the '50s [1950s] now, so we finally get a TV and, or, or read about it in newspapers or magazines and those kinds of things so I could keep up with the stuff.  And they were always impressed with me 'cause I knew the scores and the names of the people and all those things and, and did, really did keep up for a very long time.  I've just gotten, oh, in the recent years that I don't keep up with sports as much as I used to, but it was a big, big deal back then.  So I, I got to high school, and I'm not playing anymore on any teams or anything 'cause I can't, can't, can't do that anymore.  My mother [Caretha Sapp Leach] told me when I was twelve I had to give it up, so I had to quit that.  And so, I'm starting to do things that now I have to do in high school and, and to, to make sure that I make sense with people.  And we had this teacher there, Mr. Haywood, H-A-Y-W-O-O-D, and he, he was a very impressive man, a very, very impressive man.  Matter of fact, knew, he, he saw me on a TV show that I did many years later, and he said I know her.  I taught her in high school (laughter).  But I kind of liked Mr. Haywood for some reason or another.  And I mean he was a nice guy, and we all managed to--I mean he managed to help me out with a number of things.  And so, in terms of the, the speaking, public speaking that I was doing, he would always help me with the public speaking.  And so as a result of that, I got a chance to, to see him very often and had my little crush, my first little crush in my lifetime.  And he never knew anything about that (laughter).  I'm sure he did, but he never let on, and, and I never said anything about it.  And it just went on to the next thing.
Speaker 1: Okay, you never even later years told him about this crush?
Speaker 2: No, never did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Never ever did, because when I finally saw him later, he was married.  He lived in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And I gotta go up there sometime and check on him, 'cause my brother hadn't checked on him lately.  And Ray [Raymond Leach] used to check on him all the time, but we haven't checked on him lately.  And, but I never got around to that (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 323120
Speaker 1: And we're coming up through high school [Fuquay Springs Consolidated High School, Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina] and your first prom.  Tell us about it.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) My first prom was a, an interesting kind of situation because I remembered when my sister [Bettie Leach] went off to prom.  And my father [Otha Leach] said I will take you to the prom, and I will bring you home.  That's the only way you're going out with any boys out of my house.  And so that's what he did for my sister.  And I remember saying, well, that doesn't seem like much of a prom.  I don't think I really need to be doing this.  So, when it came time for me and the prom he told me the same thing, and so he took me to the prom.  Well, I had this, I'd had this little fellow that I knew.  His name was Kelso, K-E-L-S-O, Adams and had known him since junior high.  And because they, they, the, the school that I went to was a consolidated school.  And that meant that it consolidated all of the students from the surround--all of the African American student from the surrounding--'cause it was only African American at that time--from the surrounding communities.  They came there to go to high school.  Well, actually they came in junior high, and then they went from there to high school.  Yeah, from seventh, seventh grade I think they came in, and then they went on through high school.  So he came, and, and we always talked to one another.  So when it came time for the prom, he said I'd like to take you to the prom.  Well, I told him my father said that I can't go with you to the prom, but, because he's going to bring me, but we made arrangements.  But he said I ought to be able to take you back.  I said well, well, we'll see what goes on with that.  Well, I tried to figure out how I was going to do that.  And so, what I did was, I just left the prom a little early, so when my father came to pick me up I was not there.  And of course, we were, we, he had this, he had his brother's auto, his, his brother's car that he had, had, had, this brother had loaned him for the evening so he--and of course, here we are, 15, 16, 16, 16.  Yeah, he was about 17 at that time 'cause he was a little older than I was at that time.  And of course, we were supposed to be going directly home.  And you know, I, I just thought it was just nice to be with Kelso with this--well, he had other ideas.  And I knew that those other ideas were gonna get me in a lot of trouble, so I said no, no, no, I don't think so.  I do not think we--and I'm furthermore, I think you need to be taking me home at this time.  So we did a little bit of the necking and everything that people, that youngsters did during that period that I'd heard about and read about in books and that type of thing.  But it was leading in a direction that I knew was going to get me in trouble, so I said I don't think we need to go any further with this, so you'd better take me home.  And furthermore, my father's gonna kill me if you don't.  So he said yes, I know about Mr. Otha.  So, 'cause they always called him Mr. Otha.  So we got home, and daddy had been to pick me up, and he was not feeling good about the situation at all.  But he went on to bed, and my mother [Caretha Sapp Leach] met me at the door and said say goodnight.  I said goodnight, see ya (laughter).  And then when I came in she said your father is not pleased with you, so go to bed and we'll talk about it tomorrow.  So I went on to bed, and we talked about it the next day.  And I talked to my dad, and I said dad, I didn't see you, and it was true.  I didn't see him.  I, well, I didn't see him 'cause I wasn't there (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But it all worked out, and I got forgiven.  And I got my punishment, and I went on to the next thing (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right, all right.
Story_ID: 323121
Speaker 1: Now it comes up to the time where you are graduating [from Fuquay Springs Consolidated High School, Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina], and you have decided you want to go to college.
Speaker 2: That's right, yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And I was ready to try and capitalize on my dream of when I was four years old, when I decided that I wanted to be a lawyer.
Speaker 1: And this is 1960, right?
Speaker 2: When?
Speaker 1: This is--
Speaker 2: When I graduated high school?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Fifty-six [1956].
Speaker 1: Fif- '56 [1956]?
Speaker 2: Fifty-six [1956], right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Fifty-six [1956] I graduated high school.
Speaker 1: Sixty [1960], right, that's right's.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you see.  And, and I said I'd like to go to law school, and my father [Otha Leach] said no, no.  He said, "I told you years ago lawyers are liars, and that's best left to men."  I always thought that was a great statement (laughter).  I tell my lawyer friends that all the time.  And so he said you need to, basically what he said was you need to go and do something safe, 'cause you need to go to do something so you will have a job.  And, and he'd already learned that he wasn't gonna get my mother [Caretha Sapp Leach] with it, with, do, if somebody wanted to go to college, so he just as thought he might as well cooperate and did whatever.  So he said you need to--they opened that new nursing school at A and T [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina].  And, and that was where my sister [Bettie Leach] was going.  And I didn't know he knew about the nursing school.  He said you need to go to nursing school.  He said and that's where, that's where my money's going.  Well, at that time scholarships were not plentiful.  And if they were I didn't know about how to get them and to deal with them.  And then they weren't plentiful during that period 'cause we looked into a couple of areas and we couldn't manage to get any.  And I--
Speaker 1: Had he been, had he been down to the general store again to discuss your education with the boys?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but he didn't say anything about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He didn't say anything about mine.  I think, I think my going to college for him made a lot of sense--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --because he knew that I'd shown, you know, the, the potential for years and years.  And so he thought that, you know, I ought to go and do it.  Plus, since my sister had gone, and she was doing fine, and, and she was almost out by this time, you see, and she hadn't married yet and hadn't had any babies, they felt maybe this might work.  So (laughter), so, I got myself prepared to go, because he said I would have to go to A and T if I was going anywhere.  So, that's what I did, filled out my application, got accepted, and went off to college.  And I was there for a year, and then we had a terrible crop of tobacco that year, and so my father could not pay my tuition, you know, for the next year.  And so I was, I stayed out for a year, and then I went back the next year. And, but the year that I was out I stayed with my sister in New Jersey, 'cause Bettie moved to New Jersey with my aunt because she could get a better job in the school there.  And so she moved to New Jersey with my Aunt Helene [ph.], and she lived with her for a little while.  And then she got an apartment on her own, and I came and stayed with her.  For about nine months I was there, and then I went back to school the following year.
Story_ID: 323122
Speaker 1: When I went back to school [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] the following year I decided to join the [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 2: Tell us about that.  Give us a little more detail.  How, how did that happen?
Speaker 1: Well, I was working a lot of jobs just trying to make ends meet because my father [Otha Leach] told me when I was going off to school, he said now, I'll pay your tuition and your room and board.  He said but all of the extra money, you will have to get it on your own because I can't afford to, to do that.  I've got six other kids here that I've gotta take care of, and, and so I can't afford it.  You're gonna have to figure out how you're gonna get that.  And so, I knew how to do a number of things.  You know, I'd gone to the home economics classes, and I had sewed my way through college--through high school [Fuquay Springs Consolidated High School, Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina].  And so I said well, you know, I know I can always sew, you see.  And then I, I could do hair because we always did our hair at home, you know, with the straightening comb and all of those things at that time.  So I knew how to do that, and I could clean house.  Mother [Caretha Sapp Leach] made sure I knew how to clean house; even though I didn't like it, I could do it.  So I went and got into those kinds of jobs.  And one night I was coming home from cleaning Mrs. Alexander's [ph.] house.  And Mrs. Alex- Mrs. Alexander didn't have a dirty house.  Mrs. Alexander needed company more than anything else, and so I'd go down and sit and talk with her.  And she'd feed me, and she paid me for cleaning her house, which was about fifty cents an hour, you know, which was about the same amount I made doing hair or, or sewing clothes for people.  And, and I was coming home one night and passed by the student union, and I saw this big poster that stated the [U.S.] Army Nurse Corps needs you.  And I said oh, I'll bet they got money.  So I said let me go in and see what this is all about, so I went inside to see.  And I tell everybody nursing at that time had a shortage, and nursing has had shortages on many occasions.  And they had a shortage, and the Army, of course, had a shortage also because the Army's nurses comes from those in the society at large.  So I went to--I, I heard her talk about--I mean I saw the poster, and I went inside.  And there was a young major there who was passing out applications and talking to people about going into the Army.  So I went and, and decided that I wanted to sign up.  So I picked up all of the papers and everything, and she said to me, "Don't you want to know about the obligation?"  You know, you get to go to school for this period of time. You get two years.  We pay you for two years, but you have an obligation that you had.  And I remember saying to her, "Well, ma'am, you can tell me about the obligation, but you know, when you're nineteen you can do most anything."  So--famous last words--so she told me.
Story_ID: 323123
Speaker 1: Now you're being informed, yes, we'll pay all of your tuition and everything at school.
Speaker 2: Right, tuition, room and board (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But there's an obligation.
Speaker 2: That's right: tuition, room and board [at Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina], $250 a month stipend, but there's an obligation.  And so I said, "Well, tell me about the obligation, but when you're nineteen you can do anything (laughter)."
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And she said your obligation is three years.  And you know, I--
Speaker 1: Three years of [U.S.] Army service.
Speaker 2: Three years of Army service in exchange for paying for two years of, of tuition, room and board.  And I thought that was pretty fair I thought it was pretty good because, and, and I thought I should do it, you know, without any problems.  I had this little love of my life at that time.  You know, they come in every now and then.  And I remember him saying to me when I, when it was time for me graduate that, he said oh, he said, you're graduating.  Because at that time, if you were female and you got married before you came on active duty, you could not come on active duty.  You were dismissed from the program, you know.  And so I said but I thought I should go, you know.  I, I thought I could wait a couple of years to get married; I mean three years to get married.  He said, "It's the Army or me."  I said, "Oh."  I said, "Well, let me think about this overnight."  Let, let me think about it overnight to translated into, I gotta go call my mother [Caretha Sapp Leach] (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --'cause that's exactly what I did.  I went and called my mother, and I can remember having called my mother on many an occasion, after the phones came to the country, but she never told me what to do, never.  She always sat and listened to the story.  And when she got finished, she would repeat back to me what I said I wanted to do.  And in this case, she said, "You know, I remember you from when you were a little girl saying that whenever you grew up you wanted to travel.  And you wanted to go to some of the places that you read about in the books and so on."  And she said, "And this looks like an opportunity for you to do that."  And so she said and, "I just need to ask you a question: if you're not gonna do it now, when are you gonna get it done?"  I said, "Great idea."  So, the love of my life became the un-love of my life the next day.  And then I saw him some years later, and he'd got fat and bald, and so I said I did the right thing, no (laughter).
Story_ID: 323124
Speaker 1: I was getting ready to join the [U.S.] Army.  And so I told the lady, "Give me the papers; I'm signing up."  But see, I wasn't eighteen.  I was, I said when you're nineteen.  I wasn't nineteen then because I was just turning eighteen, and I had to have my parents [Caretha Sapp Leach and Otha Leach] sign, you see; they had to sign.  And so, this was in the, this was in the springtime.  And so I was coming home.  I came home and I presented--I, I decided how I was gonna do it.  See, you have to decide how you're gonna deal with parents.  I mean (laughter), parents always have to be dealt with, but you gotta plan how you get that done.  And I decided that I needed to talk to mother first because I'd read all the information, and I knew the points that I wanted to make and everything.  But I'd probably try to present it to mother first, and so I did.  I presented it to mother, and she thought it was a great idea.  She said geez.  She said, "You don't have to struggle anymore.  You don't have to do all those jobs you're doing, she said, because I worry about how you're gonna get your studies done and all those things."  But she didn't know I could do all of that stuff and still go out and boogey.  But anyway, she said, "This will help you in those areas."  So I said okay.  So I--she said I'll talk to your father about it.  So I guess she must have talked to him whenever they were alone with their thoughts, you know, because he took it to the boys, as he did everything.  You know, what's the most amazing thing?  I didn't find out until years later that men gossip a lot.
Speaker 2: He took it to the general store.
Speaker 1: He took it to the general store to the boys.  And the boys said, "Oh no, you don't want her to join the Army.  The only reason why she's joining the Army is to find a man."  I couldn't believe that.  I hadn't even thought--I, I was gonna go over there and do my nursing thing.  That's what I was gonna do at that point in time.  So, he came home and he said that (laughter).  And my mother, who had gone through this on many an occasion said--and I remember just as if it were yesterday--she said, "Listen, there is nothing that Clara [HistoryMaker General Clara Adams-Ender] can't do right here in--" Clara Mae, 'cause I was Clara Mae--"can't do right here in this town [Willow Springs, North Carolina].  There, there's nothing that she can do in the Army that she can't do right here in this town."  I remember she said that.  She said, "And furthermore, sign this paper right over here (laughter)."  And I still--
Speaker 2: Talking to your father?
Speaker 1: That's right.  And I still have the original paper that he signed.  I was just looking at it a few days ago.  So, he signed the paper, and I went off--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and joined the Army.  September 4th, 1959, I became a private--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --in the United States Army Reserve, in the WAC [Women's Army Corps] Reserve.
Story_ID: 323125
Speaker 1: And I really didn't have much of a clue as to what that meant at that time, except for I knew I was supposed to go to school, maintain a C average, and which I didn't think was too very difficult.  I already had a, a B plus average at the time, so I thought it was pretty good.  And my duty station was there at A and T [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina].  And so I thought this was great because I didn't talk about it whenever I was dealing with high school [Fuquay Springs Consolidated High School, Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina] and so forth, but I seldom, if ever, went to school more than fif- 150 days a year.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now my--when I was high school.  Now my high school record would not reflect this because the principal did what he needed to do for those children that were going off to college.  And I, while I wasn't there during the time, my high school record will indicate that I did the work.  Because what would happen was my girlfriend would send my assignments by the bus driver.  And when we, when the bus driver came by our place he would stop, and he would give us our assignments 'cause we all had little friends there who would send our assignments.  And then in the morning--I'd work out the assignment at night, and then in the morning I'd give him the assignment.  He'd get it back to my girlfriend, and she'd give it to the teacher.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so it was, and so I, I made good grades.  As a matter of fact, I graduated valedic- I mean salutatorian of my class in high school, and I never went to school more than 150 days out of, out of the 180 every year because we had to work the farm.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And my dad [Otha Leach] said, and he was no different than the rest of the farmers around, he said the farm has to be worked, and you have to be here at this time.  So, I managed to--I was in, in college at that time, and I could go to school every day.  I said, "Oh, this is wonderful."  And I never missed a day of school because I always wanted to go every day, and it was great to be able to do that.
Story_ID: 323126
Speaker 1: You've just recalled a point I'd like to make here, and that is, when you're about to graduate [from Fuquay Springs Consolidated High School, Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina].  And you wanted to be the valedictorian, and you don't get to be the valedictorian.  And you had some thoughts on why you were not selected.  And--
Speaker 2: I hear--
Speaker 1: I shouldn't be throwing you this curveball, but was interesting.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I--
Speaker 1: The young lady who was selected ahead of you--
Speaker 2: Oh yes, I remember.  Well, probably one reason how come she was selected was because of the fact that she was there, and she was doing the work.  There was no doubt about the fact she was a good student.  Cecelia Richardson was a good student, yes, C-E-C-E-L-I-A, R-I-C-H-A-R-D-S-O-N.  But Cecelia Richardson was also very fair-skinned, and very long, straight hair, and a very, very pretty girl, by the standards at that time.  And the standards, and, and, and I have to talk about this because it was, it was even in the African American community.  There were, there were divisions based upon whether or not you were half white or whether you were a dark-skinned person.  And the teachers it seemed very often, and they were often quite dark, dark-skinned just as I was, but they seemed to, to support that value of the fact that if you were, if you were the fa- fair-skinned and had long, straight hair that you were somehow better than.  And I had teachers who really wouldn't even call on me in school, because I always had the answer (laughter), so, because I studied a lot and made sure that I knew what--and I made, and I, and I, and I, I took every advantage of the time that I was in school to learn everything that I could.
Speaker 1: Now we're back in high school, and that's, that's when--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --talking about--
Speaker 2: Right, yes--
Speaker 1: Right?
Speaker 2: --I'm talking about in high school, yeah.  And so Cecelia probably got the edge because she met the standard for, for being the valedictorian that year, but I made salutatorian.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And I never, I never regretted that at all (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  We can fast forward ahead.  I just--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --did not want to leave that portion out.
Speaker 2: Right, yes.
Story_ID: 323127
Speaker 1: You're able to go to school [at Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] all day.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And you don't have to go and clean house and, but you can devote all--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --of your energies and time and brain power--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --to studying.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay tell us.
Speaker 2: But I, I stepped--I kept cleaning house.
Speaker 1: Okay, you continued.
Speaker 2: Yes, I kept doing that because I, I had this, I had this real problem about work.  And I've had that problem about work all of my life.  And that is that, I didn't ever want to learn how not to work and to get lazy on the job because my father [Otha Leach] always said that you've got to work and you've got to know how to work because people will, will value the fact that you can always work.  So I, I, I was afraid that if I left my job over there and didn't work, that I may forget how to work.  And so (laughter), I--and plus Mrs. Anderson was really need, in need of company.  I means Mrs. Alexander [ph.]--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --was really in need of company, and she wanted somebody to stay over.  I didn't have very much to do, and plus she fed me, and she had great desserts.  And so (laughter), I had a great time with her.  So I kept, I kept a little job.  But, but I, I was able to then spend more time devoting to my studies because I cut back on the amount of hours that I was doing with her, you know, which was mostly just, just sitting with her and, and dealing with her at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: That worked out fine.
Speaker 1: So we are, are coming through our sophomore year.  We finished--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --up the sophomore year.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Going into junior.
Speaker 1: And going into going into your junior year.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: What was that like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, you know, in your junior year in college you're an upperclassman, you know.  And, and so you're in a position to be able to help others, you know, coming along.  And we, you are into the hospital as a nurse.  You're in to the hospital quite a bit during these periods because you are at the point where in, in the springtime you're gonna get your--you already got capped, but you're gonna get your first stripe on there, which says that you really are next to getting out of here, you know, leave.  So no, you're gonna get your second stripe because in the springtime you're getting ready to go into your senior year--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and your senior year is finished, you see.  You spent all your time over there hanging out in those hospitals at that time.  And so I was spending a lot of time doing that and also a lot of time in the lot of activities that had to do with nursing organizations and so forth.  And we had a nursing organization on the campus called TELOCA [NC Association of Nursing Students].  And it took the first two words of tender loving care, the first two letters of tender loving care, and that's what we called our organization.  And it's still there until now; it's just that we just had the fiftieth anniversary of the school last year, so--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so I went down to, to speak to them at that time.  And so I, I was president of the TELOCA and, and spent a lot of time in the hospital situation.  And we, I had a group of students that I went to, went with to the hospital to do our clinical experience.  And we had a little group going that you couldn't come into the, to the clinical area from the weekend unless you had a story to tell.  And so that's how I learned to tell stories and, and to deal with those kinds of things.  And we had some marv- we had some marvelous storytellers (laughter), and they'd used to have some great weekends.  And so we used to have a lot of fun going back and forth.  But, at the same time, I found myself very often doing what I had done at home and dealing with my brothers and sisters, and that is being the spokesperson for the group.  Because, you know, I'd learned from Uncle William [William Leach], speak loud--stand up, speak loud and clear, and nobody will misunderstand you.  And so I would do that, but I also had learned how to respect my parents.  And, and my mother [Caretha Sapp Leach], she didn't tell me when I went off to college, I don't remember, but she told me when I got ready to go in the [U.S.] Army.  She said always obey your elders.  And when you're 17, 18, 19 everybody looks older than you (laughter).  So, that was very easy for me.  I said oh yeah, that must be an elder, so I was always very respectful.  And so I could talk to adults and didn't have any trouble because I knew how to be respectful, and I knew how to say precisely what it was that I wanted and not to flounder, you see.  So we managed to do a lot of things at the school because any time anybody wanted anything, they said let's get old Leach [HistoryMaker General Clara Adams-Ender] over here.  She'll go and tell 'em what it is we need; this is what we need and blah, blah, blah.  And then so I'd go and I was the person to carry all the information.  And so that, I, I got to be a very popular student doing those things.  As a matter of fact, I, I graduated as the nursing student of the year.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I wasn't the--I didn't have the highest grade point average, although I carried a 3.3, but I was the, the nur- the outstanding student of the year--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the year I graduated.
Story_ID: 323128
Speaker 1: Let's go back 'cause that junior year, we're coming up to 1960.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And a storm is over the horizon.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: It's called the Civil Rights Movement.
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: And Greensboro, North Carolina A and T [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] was very much involved.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: The Jesse Jacksons [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] of the world and a number of other folks--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --around then.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell us about your becoming aware of that period and what you, some of the things that you did--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in your protest there--
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: --on the campus.
Speaker 2: Yes, well, I think one of things that, that was important to know about that period is that we were youngsters that, and we were very idealistic.  We knew that something needed to happen.  And we knew that we were going to do something to make it happen.  But we had not a clue about the emotion that went into this whole Civil Rights Movement and everything that was going on.  You know, we were just kids with no fear.  That's basically what we were (laughter).  And, and someone asked me not too long ago about our parents.  What'd they think about all of this?  Well, our parents had mixed emotions, you know, that, my, you would hear my mother [Caretha Sapp Leach] say out loud, "I sent you up to that school to get an education.  I did not send you to that school to protest."  But around the corner she'd say, "You go girl."  I mean, because they knew that it had been a situation that had been not very good for them over time.  They looked at the, the whole issue of separate but equal, and they knew the things were not equal.  I mean, you know, my father [Otha Leach] graduated from the third grade; my mother graduated from the sixth grade, but they could put together a whole bunch of things--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --just based on their good common sense, we'll say.  And so, they, while they--and, and, and I think they also had a fear that something bad would happen to us.  But we made sure that we kept in touch with the, with the, with the families and, and, and you know, with all our families, and so everybody knew where we were.  And I would write to my, and, and talk to my sister [Bettie Leach] on the telephone, write to her once a week and talk to her once a week too.  And they would tell us about, you know, what to watch and how to deal with because they, while they didn't get around to getting the protesting done, they certainly did lay the groundwork in terms of making sure that we understood the issues of civil rights and the fact that it was important for us to do this because we had the energy to do this.
Story_ID: 323129
Speaker 1: I got basically involved because of one of the Greensboro Four, as they are known now, a little mouthy guy that knew, that was in my class [at Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina]  that was a very popular kid on campus.  His name was Ezell Blair [Ezell Blair, Jr.; Jibreel Khazan].  And Ezell was a very friendly guy.  He came from some place up North [sic.].  I can't remember, Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] or, or New York or some place; can't remember exactly where it was right now.  But he always, you know, would, would joke with us a lot and, and you know, just keep people going.  And, and, but he and these other three guys decided that the Woolsworth campus--the Woolworth's [F.W. Woolworth Company] department store wasn't treating us quite right--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and that, that while we could go in and spend our money in that place, we couldn't sit at the counter and have a, have a, a soda, an ice cream soda, or couldn't have a hamburger, you know, couldn't have anything else.  So they talked about how the, they were going to go down and see about what was going on at that campus and deal with the whole issue of integrating that campus and making sure that we could at least eat food in that place along with everything else.  I have told people on several occasions I've never understood what the big deal was about eating together, but I'm telling you it was a major deal, okay.  And we had seen all over the place where people--you know, and, and, and I guess the same thing went on in my community where I lived when I was growing up.  But you see, we didn't eat out anyway (laughter), so that--
Speaker 2: So it was not a bother.
Speaker 1: It was, it was not a big deal (laughter), you know.  But I have heard the other side, and I've heard the issue of the fact to sit and eat with another person means that you accept that they are a person.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: That was the general idea (laughter).
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: That's what we were, that's what, that's what civil rights was (laughter) all about, you see.
Story_ID: 323130
Speaker 1: The fellows [Greensboro Four], I never knew how they managed to get down there [Woolworths] and get it started and to get the sit-in started in the beginning.  But, until the, one of the fellows who, Richmond [sic. Joseph McNeil], who grew up to be a major general in the [U.S.] Air Force Reserve, was telling this about three years ago when we to together in this area.  But one day, they just happened to be down there, and they said, "You know, one of the--we've been saying one of these days we're gonna go down and sit at this counter."  And one looked at the other and said, "Why not today?"  And they just went in and sat down.  That's how it got started.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Well, then after that, they said oh, we've done this thing.  And of course, the local law enforcement called the school and said the A and T [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] students are sitting down here.  And, and the press got the fact that these boys went down there and sat on the, in the, on the, on the, on the, at the counter and did not get served, but they were sitting at the counter.  And you know, the press is always saying you're gonna start something and this is--you know, they were always looking at students 'cause students were always getting into, into stuff.  You know, we, we, I mean students are young.  They can do a lot of things.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So they, so they went down and sat down, but they knew that they couldn't keep it up on their own all the time.  And we were having meetings.  This is after duty, now, I mean and, and after school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know, we're having these meetings and so forth because you couldn't do it during school hours 'cause you had to go to school and get your books--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you see, because my mother [Caretha Sapp Leach] said that's why we sent you there.  So we would get together in the evening.  And I have told people this story many times that I can imagine that Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] had quite a time of it down in, in, in Montgomery [Alabama] trying to explain nonviolence to the brothers and the sisters that--the brothers mostly because I remember during this little group that we had there, the fellows said, "These are the rules that we're going to use in order to do these sit-ins because you're gonna have to help us out with them because we went yesterday and we sat down.  And now we can't go and sit all the time, and we want you to do this in shifts.  So we got organized to do the shifts and that business."  And they said, "Listen and by the way, we're going to do this in a nonviolent manner.  That means that if something happens to you, like if somebody yells at you, or if somebody spits on you, or if somebody curses at you, you don't do anything."  And the brother said, "Run that by me again now.  You want me to do what?" (Laughter) I remember that question being asked several times.  They said, "Listen now: if you don't think you can do it, don't go, because we've promised that this is the way we're going to do this."  The Richmond, General Richmond he is now, also told us that the first day that they went down there and sat down, the announced to the manager that they wanted to have a hamburger.  And, and he said, "We don't serve Negroes here."  And so they just, they said, "Well, we'll just wait until you do."  And so they just sat there, you know, in the place.  But a white woman came up and sat on the side of one of them and said what took you so long?  (Laughter) And we were, we were talking about the fact because we nev- there was never any incident.  There was, nobody ever--well, you know, folk talked about us, and they said various things.  Nobody spit on us.  Nobody touched us.  You know, they didn't, they didn't attack us.  They didn't do any of things.  The police came.  They never came too close.  They always stayed away from the cameras and, 'cause the camera, the cameramen would come, you know, every now and then to see--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and would ask questions and do things of that nature, but there was any problem.  And I think we, we were just brainstorming two, three years ago, whenever we got together with General Richmond, and we were saying that it was probably, since it was 1960, the handwriting was probably on the wall that it was going to change.  And so there was the word out that said don't, unless those students do something really, really bad, don't bother with those students at all.  We think the word went out from the, from the police department and all of theirs 'cause, 'cause they never arrested any of us.  Wait a minute.  They did throw some people in jail.  When my sister was there a bit later, they got into some other, they, some other things, 'cause I had two sisters that I sent after I left.  But they, none of us went, ever went to jail about, about sitting at the sit-ins and stuff because we were very quiet, sitting at the counter, you know.
Story_ID: 323131
Speaker 1: And finally, it was my turn to go down.  And I went down with this group, and there were four of us, two women and two, two girls, and two boys went down there because were, we were adolescents at that time.  And we got down there, and the fellow announced, one of the fellows announced that we would like to have a hamburger at this counter.  And this same manager came over and said, "We don't serve Negroes here."  And he said, "We don't eat 'em either (laughter); how about a hamburger?"  And so, I mean all those kinds of things make things a little bit light sometimes we and we got involved in.  We never thought about the fact that anything might happen to us.  I can tell you that up front.  And I, it never even occurred to me until many years later, but you know, you only think about things--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --(laughter) later on, because at that time, our big thing was the fact that we spent our money in this place, so we are part of the economy.  And we think we need to be able to eat at this counter just like everybody else does in this place.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And when we finally got to eat, it was really no big deal.  The hamburgers were terrible (laughter), but that wasn't the point.
Speaker 2: Right, that was not the point.
Speaker 1: The point was that you could sit here, and you can do this.  And of course, after we finally got served, then of course, it spread to lots of other schools.  And that lunch counter is at the Smithsonian [National Museum of American History, Washington, D.C.].  And the Woolworths [F.W. Woolworth Company]--
Speaker 2: The lunch counter that you sat at--
Speaker 1: Right, is at the Smithsonian.  And Woolworths, it sold that property to the City of Greensboro [North Carolina], and it's going to become a civil rights museum--
Story_ID: 323132
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now tell me, the Reverend Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson], who often talks about his going down and sitting at the lunch counter.  Did you know him?  Did you ever hear of him?
Speaker 2: I knew him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I knew him there, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But Jesse didn't sit at the lunch counters there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Jesse must have sat at the lunch counter someplace else 'cause Jesse wasn't there in '60 [1960].  He came, he came in '63 [1963].  No, no, no, no, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  Yes, he was.  He graduated in '63 [1963].  I graduated in '61 [1961].  He graduated in '63 [1963], yeah, so he was just getting there about that time.  Now he may have gone and sat during the same period that I was down there, but I didn't sit with him.  But we used to argue in Sunday school.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, Lord, we used to go through Sunday school a lot (laughter) because Jesse Jackson was a minister at that time.  I'm telling you he hadn't declared, but he was the minister because I will tell you, he'd debate you on the Bible any day (laughter), see.  And of course, I would debate you on anything, any day (laughter), so that we used to have a quite a time of it in Sunday school.  There was, the adviser to the Sunday school was a doctor Albert Spruill, S-P-R-U-I-L-L, and he taught, I think he taught English and voice and speech there, I believe.  I'm not, I'm not sure anymore.  But he was the adviser to the Sunday school.  And I'll tell you, he used to go through us--he died a few years ago, but he used to go with us through that Sunday school all the time.  And we'd go out to our various classes, of course.  And then when we came back, we'd have one big issue to deal with.
Speaker 1: And that was the Sunday school on campus there--
Speaker 2: On campus, right.
Speaker 1: --there at North Carolina A and T [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Story_ID: 323378
Speaker 1: We are still in the Civil Rights Movement, but you're, you're a senior now.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And you're about to graduate--
Speaker 2: About to graduate.
Speaker 1: --and fulfill your obligations.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell us about that senior year there at--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --North Carolina A and T [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina].
Speaker 2: Let me say, the senior year was wonderful because by this time I'm a PFC [private first class] (laughter) in the United States Army Reserve, and at that time they also had ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] at A and T.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But they did not allow women into ROTC.  They allowed women into ROTC the year after I graduated, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, '62 [1962] or '63 [1963], it was '62 [1962] or '63 [1963] before women got in.  However, I will tell you this: the ROTC department helped me out with a number of things.  They taught me how to wear my uniform.  They taught me how to march.  So when I went to basic, I knew a number of things that I needed to know in order to be able to deal with some of the basic drillingceremonies as far as the, the [U.S.] military was concerned.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and from the standpoint of--
Speaker 1: Now how did they teach you, since you were not allowed to enroll as a member of the ROTC?
Speaker 2: They'd just bring me over there and put me with the group.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes, indeed.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I'd just hang out with the group, you see.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And, and you know, I, I never did any formations with them and stuff, with the uniform and that type of thing.  But when they went to practice their drilling ceremonies I was out there with them practicing drilling ceremonies, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right
Speaker 2: So we got it all done, yeah, because the, the, the PMS, which is the professor of military science at that time was a Colonel Lawrence Spencer, and he died a few years ago, but he was there.  And he said you know--he was an old infantry officer, and he said you know, we have to make sure the nurses know the same thing that everybody else does, so come on over here.  And so I'd go over there and would learned stuff, and, and that's how I got my basic information in that I needed for drill and ceremonies in the, in the, in the Army.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But the, the other thing was I spent a lot of time in the hospital and in the healthcare agencies like the public health department there in Greensboro [North Carolina] and all of those areas where I needed to get specialty education and training because I was going to be going out as a senior.  You know, I was gonna be going out and going to work after that time and taking the board.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I was going to be going into the Army, so they wanted to make sure I got as much experience as possible.  I graduated when I was twenty years old, but I got commissioned before I graduated.  I got commissioned about three months before I graduated.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So then I got pictures downstairs of whenever Colonel Spencer promoted me to lieutenant, you know--
Speaker 1: Okay
Speaker 2: --and, and I got my commission.  But then, whenever I--I couldn't come on active duty right away because I couldn't come on active duty 'til I was twenty-one.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: You know, to be an officer--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you had to be twenty-one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I had to wait out the summer un- until I got to be--well, I also had to take the board, because you couldn't come on active duty until you took the state board in nursing.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So I took the state board in nursing, and then I turned twenty-one the same month, and then I came on active duty in August of 1961.
Story_ID: 323379
Speaker 1: You're going to see what life is like in the [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 2: Right.  I'm in the Army now.
Speaker 1: You're in the Army now.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes.  Let me tell you, that was a gor- ja- well, actually, going on active duty was a very adventurous experience for me because my mother [Caretha Sapp Leach] was afraid for me to fly from Raleigh, North Carolina, to San Antonio, Texas, so she said, "I think you need to take the train.  I don't think you need to be up there in the air.  The plane might fall, and I would just, she said I would never feel good about myself; so you need to get on the train and go."  Oh, and by the way, prior to going, it was two days before it was time for me to go, and the Army said we need a copy of your birth certificate; bring it with you.  And that was the first time I discovered that I didn't have a birth certificate.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: And the reason how come was because as children we were all born at home.  And it was up to the physician who delivered us to put out the, I mean to fill out the birth, information on the birth certificate and send it into the health department.  And sometimes he'd forget (laughter), you see, and when he forgot, then we didn't get registered.  But there was no time we ever needed a birth certificate 'cause you could go and do whatever you wanted to do in life without it, you see.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That was the first time I'd ever been asked for one.  Well, it's two days before, and we have, and I have no birth certificate.  So I said, "Dad [Otha Leach], I gotta get a birth certificate, you know."  So he had to get finished and, and we had to take three, two or three items to prove: the Holy Bible that you had and the--well, we had just got a brand new Bible, and daddy didn't want to take the old raggedy one that we had over there.  Well, when we got there to get the birth certificate, that's the one they wanted.  They said we don't want this new one.  You just wrote this stuff in here.  We want the old one; that way, we can see where she was recorded in there, 'cause that was the only recording we had--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you see.  So we had to go back and pick up the Bible and take it back up there.  He was the second witness, you know, that I (laughter), that I was as old as I said I was.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I said oh, I can decide my age now.  No, you can't.  I know when you were born.  So, I had to put it down.  And then we, and my mother was there, and so they, they took those three things: the Holy Bible, and my mother.  And they made me out a Delayed Certificate of Birth.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: And that's all I've ever had, is the--
Speaker 1: So you were twenty-one when you--
Speaker 2: That's right--
Speaker 1: --received your birth certificate.
Speaker 2: My first birth certificate, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: That was a--and then see, this is two days before I gotta go, and then so we had to scurry around to get that taken care of.  We got it done, and my mother said you're going on the train, so she and daddy drove me to the, and one, one or two of my sisters and brothers, drove me to the train station in Raleigh and bought me a ticket from Raleigh to San Antonio, Texas.  And I will tell you, I made some promises to myself that if I ever got off that train, I would never take such a long train ride again, and I haven't done it either (laughter).  It was thirty-six hours.  I had a, you know, I had my little seat, you know, my little place over there, and that's where I stayed all of the time.  And we got--I met this lady.  We had breakfast together in the morning.  And she was going to Biloxi, Mississippi.  And I knew all about Mississippi, and I wasn't getting off the train in Mississippi (laughter).  She said oh, no, she says it's not that bad here.  She said come on over and get off with me.  You got two hours here.  I said no, ma'am, I think I'll sit right here in my corner. And I sat right over there in my corner, and I didn't leave that train for thirty-six hours.
Speaker 1: You--
Speaker 2: But when I got off that train, I said goodbye because I said, "I'm never taking a long train ride like this anymore," and so, I, and I didn't.  When I came back I flew, but I didn't tell my mother.
Story_ID: 323380
Speaker 1: Now you were on your way to Fort Sam Houston?
Speaker 2: That's right, Fort Sam Houston, Texas.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's in San Antonio [Texas]--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --near San Antonio, home of the Alamo.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, indeed.  And when we got to, to the train station, obviously a lot of people must have come by train because the [U.S.] Army had its little booth set up there, you know, where when the troops came in, they could get them from the, the train and put 'em on buses and take them to, to the base.
Speaker 1: Base.
Speaker 2: And that's what they did.  There were a whole bunch of us there that day.  And they picked us up, and we went to the base, got to the base and then we started to process into the Army as officers.  And we had to have a place to stay.  And you picked all of this in, this information at one central location.  You got your, your, your meal ticket; you got your place to stay; you got the basic information that you needed in terms of your inventory for the room and everything that was in it and all of this.  And then you took your little suitcase and your bunk and, and you went to your, your, your room, whatever.  And it was dormitory style, just like, just like I'd been used to in, in college [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina].  And I had I think one other roommate 'cause you only had one other roommate.  I had two roommates in college for a while, but then I got down to one--and one other roommate, and we just started exploring and find our- finding our way around and type of thing.  And one of the things that I thought was important to do because I'd always said that a religion that I really liked a lot and really wanted to explore and learn about was Roman Catholicism.  And so I went over to find me a priest, and I found a priest and, and started taking lessons and doing my thing there.  The Army for me was great.  I was having a wonderful time.  I mean, you know, getting up early in the morning didn't bother me at all.  I'd done that all my lifetime.  I'd work on those tobac- in those tobacco fields, and I knew I wasn't going back there, but you learn how to get up very early, and you learn a very, very solid work ethic.  As a matter of fact, I tell people 'til today, my father [Otha Leach] taught me how to be a workaholic, you know, and sometimes that's not bad.  Sometimes that's advantageous because you can learn how to get ahead of the pack by knowing that you got the endurance that's necessary and the, that's the stamina and the persistence--
Speaker 1: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous)  that gets you through whatever you need to get through.  And so he taught me very early how to be a workaholic, but when you get to retirement you got to slow that down, don't--anyway, (laughter).  Anyway, I, I knew how to do the work.  I didn't have any problems with the work.  I'd done mar- the drills and ceremonies thing.  I knew how to, my left from my right, and so I could get all that done.  Wom- officers do a little bit different basic than, than enlisted people do, in that we didn't have to fire.  At that time we didn't have to fire rifles and do all that bit.  We didn't have to qualify, you see, at that time, but we learned, we, we--later on they got everybody doing the qualifications, and everybody's got to do those.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But we're still unqualified with rifles.  We qualified with the Berettas--
Speaker 1: Pistol. Oh, Berettas (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) pistol, yeah, so we do them.  But we were basically there to learn the, and to become familiar with the procedures and policies that were necessary to, as healthcare professionals, to take care of an Army in the field.  And that's what we basically had to learn.  And that meant--and it took us six weeks to get the- that information together.  But we did the, the basic thing that had to do with the, the procedures and, and policies that had to do with taking care of an army in the field.  You had to drill and ceremonies with the military science department and make sure that you learn how to march and salute and do parades and that kind of stuff.  And then you had to also make sure that you got your personal stuff together, your uniforms and, and all of those things, 'cause at your next duty station you were suppose go with everything ready to go, you see.  And so that's basically what we did down there.
Speaker 1: Okay, how long did you stay at Fort Sam Houston?
Speaker 2: Fort Sam Houston, I was there for six weeks.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, six week class, got it finished and, and, and was already assigned to go from there to Fort Dix, New Jersey.
Story_ID: 323381
Speaker 1: And that's what I did--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --yeah--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --for my first assignment.
Speaker 2: Okay, at Fort Dix [New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I wanted to go to Fort Dix because my sister Bettie [Bettie Leach] was in Newark [New Jersey].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And I knew I could get to see her every now and then if I went up to Fort Dix.  And this was 1961, and she got married in '60 [1960], in 1960, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, okay, had you met her husband by that time, Bettie's husband?
Speaker 1: I'd met him; yes, I had met him.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: I met him, see, when I was up there in school [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina], when I was up there for that year that I work, worked to make me some money.
Speaker 2: And he was not your favorite--
Speaker 1: They--
Speaker 2: --person.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Moses [ph.] was a know-it-all like me (laughter).  Oh, did we have some debates, ah, but he was a smart guy.  I will admit that 'til today.  He was a smart guy.  He really knew a lot of things, he really did.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So this was the re-meeting Bettie's husband.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And you were at Fort Dix.  What, what was your assignment there?
Speaker 1: Oh, goodness, my assignment there was to the intensive care nursing unit, surgical intensive care nursing unit [at Walson Army Hospital, Fort Dix, New Jersey].  And that assignment was pretty special for me because normally they did not assign lieutenants to that unit.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But, because they got in a big influx of lieutenants, they didn't have--and they didn't get any other nurses, they had to start assigning them to that unit because they had to have nurses on the unit.  So I, I got, I asked for surgery to be assigned, and, and that meant that I wanted a surgical ward, as opposed to going in the operating room.  I never did like that operating room.  And so they, they said well, the only thing, the only opening we have right now is in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit.  And so that's where they assigned me, and I, I enjoyed it; it was really fun.  I mean, it was one of the first intensive care units that was established in the [U.S.] Army, in the system.  And so, we were doing some cutting-edge things in the, in, in the ICUs, the intensive care units, at that time.  And we worked a lot with physicians who came in from Walter Reed [Walter Reed Army Medical Center; Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland], and they, of course, had other kinds of experiences.  And they brought the opportunity to do other kinds of procedures and things of that nature, so we were--but in comparisons to what they do intensive care units now, it was nothing (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Because we used to take care of, of patients there that had what you'd call a subtotal gastrectomy.  That means that they took out one-third or one-quarter of the stomach from the person because of ulcers or something of that nature.  I don't even think they get to stay overnight in intensive care units now (laughter).  We used to keep 'em two or three days, you see, before we'd send 'em out, you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: See, so the, the amount of, of, and intensity of the activities of nurses in those units now have changed tremendously, yeah.
Story_ID: 323382
Speaker 1: Now what were relations like between black, whites, other ethnicities there in New Jersey?  Was it harsh, or worse, or better?
Speaker 2: No, it was, it was, it was, it was better--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --than we'd had.  See, there was no segregation in New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was, it was an open area.  New Jersey, New York was considered to be one of those northern states, okay, and so segreg- segregation had already gone away from those, those particular places.  And so we went to all the places together.  And as far as the [U.S.] Army was concerned, of course, that went out in 1948.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so in the [U.S.] military we were far ahead of a whole bunch of people.  But you know, we had folks in there who came from the South and people who came from the North and folk who came from all sorts of places.  And when I was assigned to New Jersey (laughter), at, at Fort Dix, we had this sergeant that was on my unit that was from Alabama.  Let me tell you, he fought the war, Civil War every day.  Ev- every day he come on, he'd say, "Oh goodness, here I am in Yankee land again."  And then he'd go through his tirade and all this business and we just laugh at him and send him on his way.  But, but the, the relations between and among those of us who were in the military and, and within the surrounding communities was not a problem, yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I understand that this was a whole lot different than it was before 1948, you see.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, I met many of those old soldiers, who told me some very different stories, yeah, about Fort Dix (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, in your--
Story_ID: 323383
Speaker 1: In your career, probably very much so at Fort Dix [New Jersey], you ran into problems that may or may not be based on race or rank in, in there.
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: And tell us about some, some of those--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --because it wasn't easy I know.
Speaker 2: Well, one of them had to do with something that is, that was kind of a, a privilege--I, I would call it a privilege--that physicians had, in that--and it is.  It started in my, in my nursing school too, in that whenever a physician came into a room and there were other people there, everybody stood up, you know.  And, and for me, this was--when I was in nursing school, you know, I never sat down a lot anyway.  I was probably standing when the physician came around (laughter).  But when I got to, to work on that unit in intensive care, I had to spend so much time trying to get myself organized until I didn't have any time to waste, which I considered wasting, standing up simply because the physician came in the room.  And, and I used to, to plan and, and still do organize today trying to get my world organized so that I can make it through the day.  And I was one evening trying to figure out: how can I get this nursing done better and quicker and, and, and make sure that I get things done because I was staying stuff like an hour and a half to two hours after just trying to catch up on everything.  I found out later, the nurses always have too much to do in the first place, and so it wasn't my organizational skills that were the problem, but I still tried to get them straight.  Well, I decided I, I would always go through and think about these situations that would cause me problems and figure out how I could save time.  And one day I decided standing up every time a physician comes into the room is disruptive.  I can't get organized doing that type of thing, so the next time a physician comes up, comes into the room, I'm not standing; I'm going to stay in my chair and work on my book.  And I probably would have been able to do that without any difficulty whatsoever, except for the next physician--the next evening I was on duty, the next physician who walked in the room was the chief of the Department of Surgery (laughter) that we called Big John [ph.] behind his back.  We called him Colonel Sharp to his face, but we called him Big John behind his (laughter) back.  Big John Sharp [ph.] walked in the room, and I said oh, well.  Well, what he did not understand was that I couldn't have stood up if I'd wanted to because my legs were so (laughter), so weak 'cause I was scared to death.  Geez, this is Big John Sharp.  I mean how am I--
Speaker 1: Chief of surgery.
Speaker 2: Chief of the Department of Surgery.  And you know them surgeons were, ah, arrogant and everything else they were at that and you know, full of themselves, and, and he was a good-looking man, tall, mixed gray hair, I mean, you know, wore his, colonel, I mean he looked wa- looked well in his uniform, easy on the eye, everything; there was no doubt about that fact.  But I had made this commitment, and so I said--he came and he just kind of, um-um, cleared his throat a little bit.  And I looked up and I said, "May I help you sir (laughter)?"  And he said, he looked down on me like I'd crawled from under a rock or something, and he said, "You can help me first lieutenant by getting out of that chair."  Well, I said Clara [HistoryMaker General Clara Adams-Ender], this is the crossroads.  You can, and you know, you have to do this quick in your head (laughter) because you gotta, you gotta make a decision.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: You gotta do something in a few minutes, in a few seconds you gotta do something.  And I said now I can either get up now and be popping up for the rest of my life, or I can sit here and explain what it is I'm trying to do, and, and go on from here.  So, I decided I'd try to explain the rule, and if that didn't work then I'd get in something else.  But I said sir, I said I'll tell you how come I'm sitting in this chair.  I said tonight I am here.  The house is full.  That meant I had ten patients over on the, on the, on the intensive care side.  And in the evening we had to run the recovery room because if there was surgery still going on after the regular duty hours, which was about 5:00, you had to take those patients in that recovery room afterwards, and sometimes physicians would still be operating.  So I said and I've got four coming back from the, from the operating room.  I said and I need to, and I only have two corpsmen with me, and I've got to get my books organized.  If I don't get these organized, I won't be able to manage these patients tonight.  So, if I can help you with something, I'll get up and do it.  But if not, I'd appreciate being able to sit here and get my books organized.  He knew that unit better than I did.  And he just kind of looked at me again and hmm, and went on checking on his patients and doing what he needed to do, and I sat there.  But, honey, I was shaking like--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --a leaf because I'm a lieutenant.  This is a colonel I'm talking to.  And, and you know--
Speaker 1: Full colonel.
Speaker 2: Full colonel, right; this is a colonel.  And you know, at the same time, you do normally, whenever a colonel came in the room that's just a common courtesy in terms of the--but in the hospital we didn't do that because of the fact that there were other duties that we had to do.  And you, and in the operating room you got no time to salute.  (Laughter) You gotta keep on doing what you're doing; you know, you're saving lives, you see, stamping out disease.
Story_ID: 323384
Speaker 1: So, he [Colonel John Sharp (ph.)] didn't say anything to me, but about two days later the chief nurse called me down, you know.  And so I went down to see her, and she sat down and she was talking to me about how I, I was doing very well at my job and how I should look at finishing my degree so that I could go to graduate school and do all those things.  And you know, my mother [Caretha Sapp Leach] said obey your elders, 'cause that's what she told me when she put me on that bus going to San- I mean on that train--
Speaker 2: Train.
Speaker 1: --going to San Antonio [Texas].  And this woman had white hair, and so I said well, this must be an elder. But how am I gonna tell her I already have my degree (laughter).  But I went through this thing about three times.  But well, basically what happened to me was: when I would do these radical things that was all in the name of patient care--I'll tell you, I had no ulterior motives at that time, and I wasn't trying to disrespect anybody.  I was just trying to get patients taken care of [at Walson Army Hospital, Fort Dix, New Jersey].  And I, and maybe somebody else could do it quicker, but I had to do what I had to do, and it was taking me a long time, and I was trying to save me some time.  But what was happening was: he would report me, or somebody would report me, you know, all these little radical things I was doing.  And she called me down, but she never told me the reason how come I was called down.  She would always talk about the fact that you are doing a marvelous job.  And when things got really hot sometimes, she would pull me from the unit and say, "Listen, tomorrow, you need to come and report to me 'cause I need a floater."  And so I would become the floating nurse, and I would go to her and get my assignment in the morning.  And I would go--'cause I could do that, you know, because I knew the stuff that I was doing very well.  And it was going very well, but you know, I was always trying to make sure that I did it better.  And she would say you are doing a wonderful job in what it is that you're doing.  But he would report me.  But I finally found out what he really thought of me one day.  One evening, one evening, well, actually it was evening duty.  I was on again 'cause lieutenants pull a lot of evenings and nights because, one, that's the best way to, for them to get experience by themselves to see if they're ever gonna grow up to be anybody.  (Laughter) And the second thing is majors and lieutenant colonels can't, can't do that business of changing them shifts like them lieutenants can.  I mean lieutenants can do that stuff and still go out and boogey, but we got a lot of evenings and nights.  And I used to tell nurses when I finally got to be a chief nurse, I said you're gonna do a lot of evenings and nights, but I'll come and see you.  So I was there one evening, and I was on evenings, and Colonel Sharp came in to see his patient.  And I had a little bit of time, so I stood up when he came in that day.  And I said, "Sir, how you doing?"  And then went over to talk to him and his patient.  Well, I had called downstairs about another patient that I had on the unit because he had had a seizure.  And I didn't know I was supposed to say that he had a seizure, but I saw it (laughter), and I knew what it was, so that's what I called it.  And the physician, and I called the surgical officer of the day, and it was a little captain, you know.  He's got about as much time in surgery as I got.  And so he came up, and instead of telling me, "You have made a diagnosis, lieutenant; you can't do that."  He just kept asking me questions about this seizure.  Now I had described it in my notes, and it said everything I was supposed to say, I thought, but he kept asking me these same questions over and over.  And I remember thinking: he keeps asking me the same questions.  Why does he do that?  But he wanted me to say that it wasn't a seizure.  And I wasn't gonna say it because I'd already said it was (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, Colonel Sharp is over in the other corner, and he's go, he's listening to this exchange.  Finally he said, "Captain, if that lieutenant said that that patient had a seizure, that patient had a seizure."  Tell you.  I was all right from then on 'cause John Sharp--
Speaker 2: Walking on cloud nine.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That's right: John Sharp had validated me.  I mean everything--I mean after that time the word went out that (laughter), that that nurse knows what it is she's doing.  Let me tell you, they didn't give me any more problems on the evenings and night.
Story_ID: 323140
Speaker 1: This morning we're going to do a continuation and hopefully ending interview with General Clara L. Adams-Ender [HistoryMaker General Clara Adams-Ender].  General, I would like to begin by asking you to just give us today's--oh, I've, let me, I need to tell who's here.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Identify us.
Speaker 1: Yes, the cinematographer this morning is Scott Stearns.  The interviewer is [HistoryMaker] Paul Brock.  And we are interviewing General Clara L. Adams-Ender.  General Adams-Ender, would you begin by telling us today's date?
Speaker 2: February 1st, 2006.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where are we at doing, in doing this interview?
Speaker 2: In Lake Ridge, Virginia.
Story_ID: 323141
Speaker 1: Last time we stopped you were at Fort Dix [New Jersey].  You were a lieutenant at that time.  And you were facing up to some of the rules that you were going to follow and you weren't going to follow, as, as I remember at that time.  Let's begin this morning with some of your most memorable experiences while you were at Fort Dix in New Jersey at the Whalen Hospital there.
Speaker 2: Walson--
Speaker 1: Walson Hospital [Walson Army Hospital, Fort Dix, New Jersey].
Speaker 2: Well, well, some of my most memorable experiences had to do with what happened at work and, and learning how to do the work of nursing because we worked long hours, and there was a lot to do.  And I remember most often the things that I had to do to get myself organized to do the work that I had to do.  And, and this was the first time, of course, that I had ever been in a situation where I had to be responsible for my own actions as a nurse, see, because I was a new graduate [from Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --at this time.  And when I came on active duty and, and, and finally got my station at Fort Dix, then that was when I was assigned to do and be a professional nurse and to be able to take care of patients on my own and be responsible for large groups of patients.  I was assigned in the intensive care unit at Fort Dix.  And later I learned that the chief of Department of Surgery [John Sharp (ph.)] really didn't want new lieutenants in that area, but he, the chief nurse had no choice because she had mostly lieutenants.  And as a result of that, she had to put us in, into that unit.  And while we were not as experienced as some of the older nurses who were there at the time, the captains and the majors, they really did a lot to help us out and, and to learn the things that we needed to learn.  And we were really quick learners, you see, because we didn't know anything (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --to start with.  And when you don't know much, I mean you're just like a sponge; you'll just sop up everything that comes along.  And so that's what I was, that's what we were doing during that time.  There were about two or three other lieutenants there with me.  And so I learned a lot of things doing that period, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, just to remind our audience, what year what was that?
Speaker 2: This was 1961, yeah.
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-one [1961].
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  I came on active--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --duty in, in August of 1961 and went to, to Fort Dix in October of that year--
Speaker 1: Of sixty--of--
Speaker 2: --right, yeah.
Speaker 1: --nineteen, six--
Speaker 2: Sixty-one [1961].
Speaker 1: --sixty-one [1961]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 323142
Speaker 1: There were some challenges you faced, I'll put it that way, from some of the people who I guess maybe just did not like you or just did not like the way that you did things.  Can you recount some, some of those things?
Speaker 2: Well, what the, I believe the, the situation most had to, to do with was, for me, from my standpoint, it had a lot to do with what I needed to do and what actions I needed to take, when and why I needed to take those actions.  And every day I went to work, I would go back and try, and at the end of the day, try and look at what I had to do during that day and try and figure out what I could do it to do it more efficiently, quicker, and, and in order to be able to take care of the patients better.  And the, the, in nursing, we had a rule at that time that said that whenever you, you were a nurse, you, and physician came into the room, you had to stand.  Now there are a lot of people who don't understand how come that rule exists, and I didn't either.  But we just followed it because we were, we were taught that when we were in nursing school, and so we just followed that rule when we, we got on active duty.  Well, I had a little bit of trouble with that because I had the difficulty of trying to get myself organized, the patients organized, and the staff that was helping me doing that period.  And to be able to, and, and to be required to stand up each and every time a physician came into the room was disruptive.  So I made a few decisions on my own as to how I needed to deal with that (laughter), without asking anybody's input.  And I decided that I had to eliminate that from, that action from the things that I, that I had to do in order to be able to, to get the work done that was important for the patients, because that was my main focus.  We had been taught: you must do whatever you can in order to be able to provide the best of care to the patients that you have.  And I could not understand, for the life of me, what standing up for a physician when he came in the room had to do with providing good nursing care, so I decided I would eliminate it.  I probably should have asked somebody, but I didn't.  So, the next--I said, I promised myself that day that when I go into work this evening, the next time a physician comes, a physician comes into the room I'm not standing because I've gotta get my books organized and all those things.  Well, as luck would have it, the next physician to walk into the room was the chief of the Department of Surgery [at Walson Army Hospital, Fort Dix, New Jersey]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that we called Big John [John Sharp (ph.)], behind his back.  We did not call him that to his face.  To his face we called him Colonel.  And I said oh, dear, it's either I, either I stand up now and be standing for the rest of my life, or I sit and try and explain what's happening.  So, he cleared his throat a bit, um-um, and I looked up.  And I said, "Good evening, Colonel Sharp," and he said good evening.  And I said, "May I help you with something?"  And he said, "Lieutenant, you can help me first by getting out of that chair."  And then I had to make a decision, and I did very quickly.  And I said sir--well, by this time, I couldn't have stood up had I wanted to, my legs were so weak (laughter).  So, I said, "Sir, I have a lot of patients here this evening, and I have a very few, I have very few staff members."  There were only two other people to help me, one to work on one side and one to work on the other side because intensive care section had to also cover the recovery room if there were patients in the recovery room.  And we still had patients in the recovery room from surgery that day, so one person was over there, and I, we were over on the other side, and we were full.  So I said, "Sir, and I would really like to sit here and be able to get my books organized.  And if you don't mind, I would just like to keep my chair and get that done, unless I can help you with something."  He didn't say one word to me.  And I knew that he knew just about that unit as I did.  And so, he didn't say a thing.  He just went around and checked his patients and did what was necessary for him to do, and then he left.  He never said another word to me about that.  But I found later that he had talked to the chief nurse about it.  And every time--I used to spend a lot of time with the chief nurse (laughter)--but every time he would talk to chief nurse about it she would call me down, and, and, and she never told me that he had said anything about this.  She just talked to me about what my plans were in nursing; what was I learning on that unit; how did I feel about how I was progressing and taking care of patients.  She was a wonderful person, and we just discussed those kinds of things.  And then, if it got really warm, and he got really upset, she would send me off the unit for a while.  And I didn't, you know--she said you know, "I need somebody to go float to another place."  She said, "You're doing so well in learning the, the practice of nursing," she said, "I'm gonna send you up to this unit for a while.  And, and you come to me every morning and you get the assignment, and I will send you to wherever you're needed you know, okay."  So I said, "Fine; I can do that."  And, but I didn't know that the real reason was because I had been what was perceived to be insubordinate.  I still don't think I was, but it was perceived that way, and so I, she would send me to some other place until things cooled off, and then they'd send me back.  Well, when she'd send me to some other (laughter) place to work, the other physicians that was on the unit would come and, and they'd see me, they'd say, "Where are you?"  And I said, "Well, I'm over in this particular area.  I was sent by the chief nurse over there."  And then they'd go down and say you gotta send--I was Leach at that time-- "You gotta send Leach [HistoryMaker General Clara Adams-Ender] back down to ICU [intensive care unit].  She helps us out a lot there (unclear)."  And so then she'd send me back.  It was, and I thought, you know, the, the chief would always speak to me whenever he came in, the chief of the Department of Surgery.  But he never said anything to me about what was happening.
Story_ID: 323143
Speaker 1: But I think I redeemed myself one evening, whenever I was working with this patient that had had a seizure.  And I didn't know that I was, was not supposed to say the patient had a seizure 'cause that's a diagnosis (laughter).  But I observed it, and I saw the movements, and according to the books that I had read, that was a seizure.  So I called down to tell the, the officer on duty, the surgical officer on duty that this patient had a seizure, and I would appreciate if he'd come up and look at him.  Well, when he came up, he did not say to me that I had given a diagnosis, and nurses were not supposed to give diagnoses.  He just kept asking me the same questions about the symptoms over and over.  Well, Colonel Sharp [John Sharp (ph.)] was in the room, and he listened to this exchange for about ten minutes.  And finally he said, doctor, he said if that nurse said that that patient had a seizure, that patient had a seizure.  I tell you, that was wonderful (laughter) because, because he just--
Speaker 2: Validated you.
Speaker 1: --validated me, and that was wonderful.  I had no more problems with anybody about anything.  And you know, and I didn't do diagnoses very often because I knew, I thought I knew the realm.  But I thought when you were describing the symptoms of a seizure you should say listen, this person had a seizure, you know.  And, and so we got that all sorted out.  But that was, that was one of my memorable activities [at Walson Army Hospital, Fort Dix, New Jersey].
Story_ID: 323144
Speaker 1: We were known as a group of lieutenants there, and we had a marvelous time there because we were--lots of lieutenants around.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We were known for being able to work hard and then to play hard at the same time.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And we did.  And, and you know, we weren't doing a lot of things.  It's just that, you know, dancing was a good thing to do; it was a good activity.  And they had the clubs that were available, and so we would go to the clubs and we could have our activities there together.  And, and it was just marvelous, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Dancing was one of the fun activities--
Speaker 1: Oh yes.
Speaker 2: --that you did.  Were there any others--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --besides going to the clubs and that--
Speaker 1: Yes, going to the club, and well, church, you know--
Speaker 2: Church.
Speaker 1: --I didn't taught from my life--from my beginning--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that you gotta go do your church thing.  And so I did a lot of activities with the church, and went to, went to many of the functions during the evening, and, and starred in some of their plays and things of that nature because--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --I was always a ham.  And I always liked--
Speaker 2: So you--
Speaker 1: --that kind of activity and so on.
Speaker 2: Oh, so you did some of, you, you starred in some of the plays?
Speaker 1: Oh yes, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the, the church did, and they had a little theater on the post too that--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --that we worked with at that time.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I did that throughout most of my career.
Speaker 2: Okay, now how long were you at Fort Dix [New Jersey]?
Speaker 1: I was at Fort Dix for fourteen months.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And then I got orders.
Speaker 2: And then, and then you got orders.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Were, were you able to get home during this fourteen months that you were at Fort Dix?
Speaker 1: Well, yes, I was, and I got home mostly because my mother [Caretha Sapp Leach] told me I needed (laughter) to come home.  I, I had spent so much time in North Carolina on that farm until--and I thought there was so much of the world to see that I should be out there seeing some of it.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, and I would go home periodically but very infrequently--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --very infrequently.  It was not as often as my mother thought I should come, you know.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: And so one day she sent a message to the Red Cross [American Red Cross].  And the message said your mother is quite ill.  She has some problems with fibroids and is especial--expected to have to have surgery, and so you need to get home right away.  So, the chief nurse called me in and said we've got this message over here.  You need to plan to go home, so I planned to go home for a week.  And when I got there, my mother did have those kinds of, of problems that she talked about, but she was nowhere near surgery, and she was nowhere near death like it sounded, that message sounded like (laughter), so.
Speaker 2: But she wanted you to come home (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's right, and she wanted me to know that when I didn't, she could get me there.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: And that's exactly what she did.  And so we made a little deal, that as long as I was in the states, I would be there for Thanksgiving or Christmas and sometime in the spring.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so I always made Thanksgiving or Christmas and Mother's Day.
Speaker 2: Oh, wonderful.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Wonderful.
Speaker 1: --I always did.
Story_ID: 323145
Speaker 1: At the end of, well, fourteen months into your tour at Fort Dix [New Jersey], you got orders.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And what did those orders say?
Speaker 2: Those orders say, "Welcome to the Land of the Morning Calm," (laughter) I got orders for Korea, yeah--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --right, and went--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --to Korea, yeah.
Speaker 1: And now we're, we're talking about 1962 or 1963?
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-two [1962], yeah.
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-two [1962]?
Speaker 2: Right, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was--
Speaker 2: No, I'm sorry, 1963.
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-three [1963].
Speaker 2: Sixty-three [1963], that's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause it was fourteen months.
Speaker 1: Where, where did you land first in Korea, and what were your duties there?
Speaker 2: Well, I landed first at the 121st Evacuation Hospital [Ascom City, South Korea] that was outside of Seoul [South Korea], about seventeen miles outside of Seoul in a little place that was a Army med- that was a, an [U.S.] Army made community.  It was an area support command.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but it was near a city called Sinchon [Sinchon-dong, Seoul, South Korea], yeah, that we used to call Sin City (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But it was just a little small place outside of, of Seoul, you know, it was, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And you know, this was re- this was really a very interesting time for me because this was all new and different, to go to a foreign country, but I was excited about going because I'd always wanted to travel.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I said hey, listen, this is the first time out of the country.  I need to go to do this particular assignment at this time.  I, I need to tell you that I was engaged to a young man who had given me a ring after college [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina], William [ph.].  And I had, had the ring, and wore it and everything.  And then shortly after I was in Korea, because he encouraged me to go to Korea, he said, because you know you always wanted to travel.  You need to do this.  And so I went on off and did that, and, and then he sent me a Dear Jane letter about six months later.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I had to deal with that.  But you know, that wasn't really too bad 'cause I was, I was with a group of lieutenants there, many more lieutenants than we had at Fort Dix, and not only lieutenants of the Nurse Corps [U.S. Army Nurse Corps] but lieutenants of all of the branches of service because we had all of the area support activities there, branches there on that base.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: For example, we had ordinance, the MPs [military police], transportation, engineers; all of them were there in that Area Support Command area.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so we all got to meet one another at the various activities, you know the PX [post exchange], and the commissary, and the club, and, and all the places that we had around
Speaker 1: Spell, Sinchon for me if you can.
Speaker 2: It was S-I-N--
Speaker 1: S-I-N--
Speaker 2: --C-H-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Sinchon.
Speaker 1: Sin City (laughter), all right.
Speaker 2: You know, troops can always make up a name.
Story_ID: 323146
Speaker 1: Tell us about your duties there--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in Sinchon [Sinchon-dong, Seoul, South Korea].
Speaker 2: Well, there I was assigned to a, an intensive care unit, again, in the 121st Evacuation Hospital [Ascom City, South Korea].  And our duties primarily were to provide intensive nursing care to patients that needed it for various reasons.  Of course, the first folks that we were supposed to deal with were the troops, you know.  But we did a lot of goodwill, which meant that we took care of a lot of Korean patients, infants through old men, because there were, there were various kinds of, of diseases and conditions that they had an experienced during that time that we didn't have in this country.  And it dealt with tropical diseases and, and other kinds of communicable diseases.  And so the, the, those of us who were the nurses, physicians, and, and all the folks there at that time wanted to make sure that we learned as much as we could about those diseases.  I remember hemorrhagic fever was one that it, the virus is carried by a rat, and, and the bacteria is carried by a rat, and, and those Koreans came down with that disease quite often.  And of course, we got an opportunity to study that quite a bit.  And, and it was just another opportunity to learn a lot of new and different things.  There, I got into volunteerism a lot because Korea at this time had a, South Korea, in which we were in, had a lot of poor people, lots of poor people.  And they had lots of orphanages, and much of this was a carryover from the war [Korean War].  But when we were there we had some free time.  And when we had free time we went down and worked at the orphanages, or we taught at the university, and because they were trying to get their nursing school going.  And the, the school that they had there was many years behind what we had established as far as nursing was concerned in the country.  So anything that we could do to help, we went down to, to help them with that.  I taught conversational English to some, some high school students, elementary and high school students for a while.  And I found out, it was the first time that I found out that we required, as a country, we required that the countries that we were trading partners with or that we dealt with in any kind of association, that everybody in the country had to have seven years of English.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: And they had had the English, but they had never had conversational English.  You know, they knew, knew the grammar and knew how to talk--to, to deal with it in the classroom but didn't, had never had conversational English, so they couldn't talk very much to other people.  So I would spend my time sitting down talking with them and giving them an opportunity to, to speak English with me.  And I discovered that they knew a lot about our history and so forth, and I was very surprised about that.  But, if you've got to take the, the language of another country, you gotta talk about something.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And so they, of course, talked about the history.  And you know, they knew a lot about Abraham Lincoln [President Abraham Lincoln] and, and George Washington [President George Washington] and all of those folks, and so they asked about--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the establishment of the country.
Story_ID: 323147
Speaker 1: How about the recreational areas now?  Besides the clubs and the dancing, what, what were some of your recreational outlets there?
Speaker 2: Yeah well, in--we had a lot of opportunities to travel, of course, to--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --various places, and a lot of people, you know, got to travel a lot more than I did.  I, I had a little problem at that time, in that I--well, actually it really wasn't a problem; it was a, it was a, a, an obligation I, that I had made.  But I had promised my two sisters that followed me in high school, that if one would wait one year until I got myself established, I'd send 'em both to college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And because my dad [Otha Leach] thought if he educated one of us, all of the rest of us ought to figure out how to get the rest educated.  And so, when others didn't step up to the plate, there wasn't nothing I could do about that.  I just had to do what I had to do (laughter).  So, I had the two of them in college, so I didn't have a lot of extra money, no--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --really extra money was not--but I did live vicariously through a lot of people.  And, and I did get an opportunity to take one trip to Korea--I mean, I'm sorry, to Japan.  But we could wander all around Korea, you see, because you could go--we were, we were kind of centrally located there in, in Ascom City around Seoul [South Korea].  But you could go up north, and we would go up north to visit the troops up there because there were no women up north.  And I remember the chief nurse saying, "Listen, there are things that you have to do sometimes simply because you are women, and you are located in a certain place."  And she said, "And we are going to, we are going to make sure that we accommodate the troops up north if we can at any point in time."  And so, she would say, "Whenever you're off, if you, if there's a trip going up there, you ought to go and see them."  Well, we went up, and, and it was really very simple.   When the, when the guys came back from the field and so forth, we would go in and we would be there.  And they would have their dinner and parties and that type of thing, and we would just, would be there in the area.  And I think part of the, part of the strategy was to keep them from going down in the local villages--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and that type of thing.  And so, and so we would be there because, you know, only asked of us was to be hostesses, you know.  And I sat there and listened to more folks talk about what it is that they had done, probably half of 'em lies and (laughter), but just embellish what had gone on while they were in the field and the things that had happened.  And it was the building of the comradeship, not only among these fellows who have to, had to get together to get their job done, but among the nurses who may have to take care of 'em in case something happened to them, you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And she explained all of that to us, and I said, "Oh, well, this is a great idea."  And I went, we went up there, and we, we had a good time doing that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 323148
Speaker 1: And how long did you spend in Korea?
Speaker 2: One year.
Speaker 1: One year?
Speaker 2: Right, one year--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yes--
Speaker 1: So now--
Speaker 2: --indeed.
Speaker 1: And you got your orders in '64, 1964?
Speaker 2: Right, yes.
Speaker 1: And what did those orders say?
Speaker 2: Well, when I got those orders--well, actually before I got orders, the [U.S.] Army Nurse Corps branch sent me a letter and said you need to know that at the end of Korea your time will be finished in the service.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: And, but you need not leave.  You can extend and you can be considered to go on recruiting--because a lot of people said I could be, I should be a recruiter for the [U.S.] Army, which I never wanted to do--and the, the, or she said you can go teaching.  Now teaching always appealed to me because I always liked to learn new things.  And I find that if you can teach new things to other people, you can learn a lot yourself--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you see.  And so, I wanted to go back and teach the little medics down in Fort Sam Houston [San Antonio, Texas].  Well, they said you can do one of these two things.  And someone told me when, and, and it was very good advice: never turn down anything in the Army unless you've got something to offer that you want to do.  And, and that was good advice.  People were giving me a lot of good advice that has, that I've used and has served me in good stead, and so I pass it on to other people.  Well, I was getting ready to go, and I said I don't really want in recruiting, so I think I'd better go talk to the chief nurse.  So I went to the chief nurse, and she said maybe you ought to find out--what do out know about recruiting?  I said well, not a lot.  She said well, let me tell you: there's a nurse [Ann B. Cost] here that has been recruiting before; she said she's a major.  And I was a lieutenant, you see, and at that time lieutenants didn't talk to majors very (laughter), very much.  Now they don't have any compunction about talking to anybody.  But we didn't, you know, we didn't socialize with majors.  We socialized with lieutenants, but I had to talk to this lady 'cause the chief nurse said you need to talk to her--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --before you make this decision.  So, I went to talk to her, and she said, "This is what you have to do in recruiting," and she said, "Why don't you want to go to recruiting?"  I said, "Well, ma'am, I'll tell you, I'm having a great time in the Army myself, but I don't wanna be responsible for anybody else (laughter) coming; plus I think I would make a better teacher."  She said, "Well then, you need to write a letter to the Army and say that."  She said, "If you're gonna consider staying you should do this."  Well, I, I, I was in a dilemma because I didn't know where I wanted to go when I came back to the states.  I knew I didn't want to go back to North Carolina, and I didn't know anything about any other place.  And it's pretty difficult to go on interviews whenever you're away over in Korea, you see, so.  So I said well, one more tour in the Army may not be bad; I mean I liked this; this is, this is fun, so I said, "I'll consider staying."  She said, "Are you gonna consider staying one more tour?"  I said, "Yes."  She said, "Well then, you tell the Army that you would not--you write this letter and you say you want, don't want to go on recruiting, but you would like to go and teach the medics down in Fort Sam Houston."  So that's what I did.  And I got a letter back saying we'll send you down to teach the medics at Fort Sam Houston--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --if that's what you want to do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then after that you will be able to go to graduate school--
Speaker 1: Wonderful.
Speaker 2: --which is what I wanted to do.
Story_ID: 323149
Speaker 1: Now, here it is, 1964.  You've been in Korea a year.  And you're faced with the choice of reenlisting and where you want to go and reevaluating what that one year in Korea was like.
Speaker 2: Yes, well, I will tell you, I still tell people 'til today that was my best assignment in the [U.S.] Army.  I had a wonderful time.  And I think much of it had to do with the association with the other lieutenants that was around and, and also getting to know some Korean families and getting to know the Koreans a lot better.  I found them to be hardworking people.  You see, we were in Korea before they made, manufactured their own cars, you see.  I mean they, they, they had a little, some, some little, small cars that they imported from Japan at that time, some of 'em they used as cabs.  We used to call kimchi cabs (laughter) 'cause they were little things that, that seated two comfortably, but they put four people in it.  And so, it was, but they didn't have their own cars at that point.  And so as a result of that, I've seen them grow since that time, but I will tell you there's a reason how come they grew.  They are really hardworking people, yeah.  And at that time, the north, where we went up to see the, the talks at Panmunjom, because you see, Korea is still under a truce.  The war's [Korean War] never ended in Korea.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Still 'til today it's never ended.  And so at Panmunjom, we went up to see that area.  The north at that time were there rich northern cousins, you see, to the people in the south.  In the south were the poor country bumpkins.  Well, I think that's kind of switched up a little bit--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it really has.
Speaker 2: --compared with what's going on.  And that country has really prospered since that time.  So I always remember Korea fondly because I had a great time there, learned a lot about how to take care of patients and to do that, but then made a real good bond in terms of dealing with the fighting troops, and started to realize that if I was gonna be an Army nurse, I needed to know who I was taking care of.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, and the chief nurse was really very wise in her just sending us off so that we could get to learn the troops in some kind of relaxed setting so that we could learn a little bit about what they did whenever they had to go off and fight wars.  And that was a good experience for me, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 323150
Speaker 1: Now you are faced with the choice, of course (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  Yeah, to stay or to go.
Speaker 1: --to stay or to go.  How did you make that choice?  What, what influenced you in making your choice?
Speaker 2: Well, as I think about it, probably Major Cost, Ann B. Cost.  She's dead today, but she was a wonderful woman.  She was the major that the chief nurse sent me to see from recruiting.  And not only did that young major tell me about what I needed to do in terms of dealing with the [U.S.] military, but she, she did her best recruiting job during that time (laughter) too, because she told me the--and I then I think she was really very candid with me.  She told me the advantages of staying.  She told me the advantages of leaving, and she told me what I could probably look forward to in terms of my future.  Well, lieutenants don't see futures; I mean (laughter) we're young people.  We don't--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --see too much beyond tomorrow, which is halfway through the night, no, no.  But what I really needed to hear, and what I think I heard from her during that time, was there are some things that you can do now to get yourself set so that you can be a leader in the [U.S.] Army Nurse Corps of the future.  And you need to do that because at some point in your life you are going to want to be in charge of a large group of people.  And as you do that, you've got to know that there is certain information that you have to have and certain things that you have to be able to do.  And she said and there are opportunities for you to learn these things and to be able to do them well when you are called upon to do them.  I mean I thought it was marvelous, and so I said oh, well, maybe I need to stay around here for a while, and because I, from what had happened to me from before, in terms of the opportunities that I had to learn surgical intensive care nursing and how to take care of patients and all sorts of situations, it had really been quite helpful to me.  And so as a result of that, I said well, if I've got that to look forward to in the future, and especially if they're gonna send me down to teach these little troops, which I want to teach, the little medics, I said this is, this is all right, you know.  And afterwards, they said we'll send you off to get the master's degree, and I always wanted to go and, and get further education.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you chose to--
Speaker 2: I chose to stay.
Story_ID: 323151
Speaker 1: The place where you wanted to be was San Antonio [Texas]?
Speaker 2: That's right, yes.  I had to go to San Antonio first to, to get the, the career course because I needed to, to be a person that was considered to be a career individual.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: And see, at that time, when, when I, when I was still in Korea, I had not finished my obligation.  But when I got to San Antonio my obligation was coming, quickly coming to an end.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I went to the--when I first came home I went to the career course  And I was one of three nurses that year who went to that career course as a lieutenant because they normally did not take lieutenants in that career course.  But we were considered to be individuals who were, who had good career potential, and so they sent us down there with those senior captains and majors to see if we could hold our own in that course (laughter).  And, and if we did, then we could go off to assignments, and then that would be great potential for our future.  Well, I went down there to do my thing, and it worked out very, very well, you know, really did.  And then when I got finished with the school, then that's when I got the assignment to go to teach the medics.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: It was interesting because you, you had to at that time--well, actually, during that time I met my first mentor in nursing that was really official.  She was the director, the course director for the career course for the [U.S.] Army nurses.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was having a little bit of difficulty at that time with a, with a roommate that I had known from Fort Dix, New Jersey.  But she and I roomed together, but she and I had different styles in terms of how we studied and managed the course and, and that type of thing.  And, but, and she was failing the course.  And one of the fellows that was in the course, who took it upon himself since he was a senior captain, to, to take care of these things and decide who should do what with whom.  He decided that I should be the person to make sure that she passed the course.
Speaker 1: Okay, what was her name now?
Speaker 2: Who's name?
Speaker 1: The person, your roommate.
Speaker 2: Oh, Thelma Robinson [ph.].
Speaker 1: Thelma Robinson.
Speaker 2: Thelma Robinson, yeah--
Speaker 1: Where was she from?
Speaker 2: --yeah.  She was from, she was from Alabama originally--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I met her at Fort Dix, and she, and, and, and actually, I really didn't know her very well--but we always called her Robbie--because she worked permanent nights, and I would see her sometimes leaving duty, you know, at that place.  But when, when we got to Fort Sam Houston [San Antonio, Texas], this was middle-1964.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All right, this is June 1964.  And at, as you, if you'll recall, during that period of time segregation was still the law of the land in the South.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And this was the South.  And we were told when we got there that we would were staying, we were living on the base, but we were told that we were, that the Army had, had insisted that San Antonio give up its segregated ways because the Civil Rights Act [Civil Rights Act of 1964] was being, was going to be passed or had been passed by the time we got--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --to it in October.  And they, they were going to have to integrate the city, and so we were going to have to move off the base eventually.  But in the meantime, we had to live two together in order to be able to use those quarters that we had there on the base.  And then when we moved off, that's the way we moved off, you know, two in the, together in a quarter, so I moved off with her.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and, and I consented to do that since she had remembered that she'd known me at Fort Dix, and so I said, sure I'll do this.
Story_ID: 323152
Speaker 1: I didn't socialize with her [Thelma Robinson (ph.)] at Fort Dix [New Jersey], so I didn't know anything about her lifestyle and that type of thing.  And that's important to know because her, her style was far drastically different than mine.
Speaker 2: Faster or slower?
Speaker 1: Oh, it was faster, oh--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --it was much faster.  She, see, she came over the evening, and she had to have a couple of drinks before she could have her dinner.  And then, then after that, you know, then we have to do a little bit to unwind and that type of thing.  And I had to get to my books very quickly so that I could make sure I could keep up with all these things.  So I had another friend that I socialized with, Carolyn Scott [ph.], who lived up the hill, and she and I would get together and study together, you know.  We were not heavy drinking people, so we (laughter), we didn't have to take time out to have a cocktail or anything at that time.  And so, I was, you know, much into making sure that I passed this course [U.S. Army Nurse Corps career course].  That's what I was about, you know (unclear).  Well, when it was decided that I needed to help Robbie [Thelma Robinson (ph.)] out, I said oh my goodness, I don't know if I can do this because I don't know if I even have enough time.  I said that I thought I was really responsible for me.  But luckily, whenever I have gotten into real strict binds about things, I have always made pretty good decisions about when I need to see somebody.  See, I learned very early, never suffer in silence.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) And so, when I needed somebody to help me out and to, and to help me sort through what it was I was about, I, I knew when to go and look for them.  And so, I went looking for the course director, who was at that time a lieutenant colonel, and her name was Lillian Dunlap.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I went to see her, and I told her my situation.  And I well, we were talking through the situation.  She was telling me things that were going on.  And so I said to her, "Ma'am, have you been peeping in my (laughter), in the window of my apartment?"  She said, "No, lieutenant, but I've lived a couple of years."  Oh, what I've learned about that since then (laughter).  And so she said, "You are, you are not responsible for whether or not Robbie passes or fails this course."  She said, "You're responsible for you here."  She said, "And if you are out helping somebody else, and you fail this course, or you don't do well in this course, I'll see to it that you never get any place in the [U.S.] Army."  And that's what she said to me upfront.  And she said, "You keep your mouth closed and do your work, and I'll get you where you think you want to go."
Speaker 2: And her name again was--
Speaker 1: Lillian Dunlap.
Speaker 2: Lillian, where, where was Lillian Dunlap from?
Speaker 1: She was from San Antonio [Texas].
Speaker 2: All right, okay.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) And she went on to be General Dunlap--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --yes, before me.  So, I said all right, I'll go back over here.  But I did want to try and help Robbie, so I did try and study with her and, and do that type of thing, but it wasn't taking, you know.  And, and so she eventually had to leave the course because she was not passing.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so she, she did eventually leave, leave the course.  But I, I thought I'd done the best I could do for that situation.
Speaker 2: Did that force her out of the [U.S. military] service also?
Speaker 1: No, no, she--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --didn't have to leave the service, but she was killed--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --shortly after that on another assignment in some brawl someplace, and, and she died, yeah, yeah, much later, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 323153
Speaker 1: So then I had to get finished with the course [U.S. Army Nurse Corps career course].  And I graduated number six in the class--
Speaker 2: Wonderful.
Speaker 1: --you see, so I thought I did marvelous.
Speaker 2: Yes, indeed.
Speaker 1: And they assigned me down to teach the little medics [at Fort Sam Houston, San Antonio, Texas].  And I went down there, and you know, it's amazing how (laughter) I guess people feel that they're giving you their best and honest opinion because they told me I had to go down--I was told from the, from the headquarters in Washington [D.C.], in the Nurse Corps [U.S. Army Nurse Corps], that I had to go down and interview for that course, you see.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: Because before I left Fort Sam Houston [San Antonio, Texas], I mean before left the career course, before we got finished in the career course, General Dunlap [Lillian Dunlap], who was Colonel Dunlap at that time, got orders, and she got sent to Washington.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So someone else came in to finish her course, and she was up in Washington by this time.  So she called me down and told me I had to go down and interview at this place.  So I went down there to interview at the place, saw the major down there in that area.  And she said, "What makes you think you got, you know enough to teach these medics?"  She was very protective of them little medics down there and very interested in making sure that they got quality people to come and teach them.  And I knew that I didn't have a lot of experience, but I was exactly a greenhorn anymore (laughter), you know.  I learned a lot since I came on active duty, and this is about two years now, you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: No, about three years now that I've--
Speaker 2: Three years.
Speaker 1: --been in, yeah.  So I told her what I thought, and she told me what she thought.  And the bottom line was she didn't think that I had enough experience to teach her medics.  So I went back and I, and, and general, and at that time Colonel Dunlap called me and said, "Listen, you call me back after you have done your interview."  So I went down and did the interview, and I called her back.  And she said, "What happened?"  I said, "Listen, Major Bailey told me that I did not have enough experience to be teaching her medics (laughter)," and I said, "I don't think she wants me down there in that place."  She said, "Well, we'll talk to her.  We'll see what goes on."  And she talked to her, and I went down there--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --you see.  And--
Speaker 2: Now, I just want to stop you for Major Bai- Bailey--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --what was her full name and--
Speaker 1: Lois [Lois Bailey (ph.)].
Speaker 2: Because she, she had taken over for Lillian Dunlap.
Speaker 1: No, no, she was down at the, the school where the medics were.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the person that took over for, for Lil Dunlap, I don't know.  Who took over for Lil Dunlap?  I don't remember.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I can't remember the name right now.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But she, but see, Major Bailey was the, was the second person, number two person in this school where they wanted to reassign me--
Speaker 2: To, to teach?
Speaker 1: --after I--that's right: to teach--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --the little medics.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, and she was number two down there, and so she was the person who interviewed anybody who was going to be assigned, because those were considered to be specialty assignments.  If you got a chance to off and teach the little medics, oh, yeah, that was a special assignment.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, so, when I called Colonel Dunlap, she said well, what did she say?  And, and so I told her what she said, and she said well, we'll see.  She said you go on back and finish your course, and, and we'll call you.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Well, she called me when the orders came.  And they said you were going down there to medical training center and you--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and you're gonna teach the little medics.  So I said oh, that's all right.  I can, I can do that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So I went down--
Speaker 2: Now, when you went down there, did you see--
Speaker 1: Major Bailey?
Speaker 2: --Major Bailey?
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Let me tell you, she was a fair person.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: She said you got sent here.  She said you know I told you I didn't think you had enough experience (laughter).  She said but you got sent here, you're gonna teach medics, and we're gonna do everything we can to help you out.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: And in all fairness, she did exactly what she said.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I worked like I said I would.  And when she got ready to leave, because she left before I did, she said, "Listen, you can teach these medics any time you want to because--" I said, "That's great."
Story_ID: 323154
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You started teaching the medics in the summer of '64 [1964], is it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, sixty--
Speaker 1: Okay, and--
Speaker 2: --no, no, summer of '65 [1965]--sixty--wait a minute.
Speaker 1: Okay, you came--
Speaker 2: I finished, I came out of Korea.
Speaker 1: Right, in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --sxity-four [1964].
Speaker 2: Right, and then I went, yeah, I went to, had to go to school, you see, for a year.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: I had to go to that career course for a year, well, actually for nine months.
Speaker 1: Oh, for a year.
Speaker 2: For nine months.
Speaker 1: Nine months.
Speaker 2: Nine months, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I went down there [Fort Sam Houston, San Antonio, Texas] in '65 [1965].
Speaker 1: Sixty-five [1965], right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, '65 [1965].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: Okay, and any memorable experiences of these medics that you were teaching then?
Speaker 2: Let me tell you--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --there were a number of memorable experiences.  Now you, you have to get the setting.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This was during the conscription army [U.S. Army]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and during the draft, okay.  You know people got drafted to come in.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And of course, the, the types of individuals that we got were, were a wide variation of people, you know; like, some of those medics were lawyers (laughter); some of them were engineers, because they just enlisted to do the minimum amount of time, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so they had to do two years, and then they were finished, you see.  And so they would come.  And so I had a variety of people with a variety of backgrounds, you see, to teach.  And we decided that we would teach at a certain level, which was like at the high school level, to make sure that we didn't lose anybody in between, you know.  So, sometimes the lawyers and those folks were kind of bored with what it was we were doing, and the folks who just finished eighth grade were-- struggling.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You see, because that's what we had, that was the range that we had to, to teach at that time.  And, but we tried to make sure that we'd got the, the lessons to the levels that they could deal with in case they had to.  And of course, by '65 [1965], Vietnam [Vietnam War] was beginning to heat up.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So we went, we got that done.  And, and I can remember having gone with the classes several times.  And actually, after I was down there, I think I understood partly why Major Bailey [Lois Bailey (ph.)] said that I didn't, she didn't think I had enough experience to teach the medics.  It wasn't about the teaching of the medics; it was about the management of the medics.  You see, because troops know various ways to keep you from doing various kinds of things.  I mean they would get me in the classroom sometimes, and they'd say oh, Lord, we got a lieutenant over here.  We can deal with this.  They get me down there, and they say, "Hey, listen, we need to have off because we got lots to do in the barracks when we get back to the barracks tonight.  We have this to do, and we have that to do.  And we, we can't clean up the room and everything today because, you know, we got these things to do.  Can't we just get off from doing it?"  I said listen--but see, they didn't understand.  I grew up with a whole bunch of brothers and sisters, you know, nine brothers and sisters.  I know about this business.  You let somebody get off from doing their job, you gotta do theirs and yours too.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Oh no, I was born one night but not last night.  So (laughter), I said, "Listen, if you don't help me clean up this room, I gotta clean it up myself.  Do you know that a lieutenant's got no business doing this when you troops are all here?  There is no way."  They said, "Oh, God, you're worse than the recruiting sergeant (laughter).  You got an answer for everything."  (Laughter) So I said but that was part of the whole thing.  If you didn't have an answer for it--'cause I had some other friends down there who got themselves into a lot of binds because they (unclear), "Oh, the troops got so much to do."  Yeah, but you got that whole room to clean up once you're done.  Nah, we'll have none of that.  So, (laughter), I, they, I got, I, they gave me a lot of credit for being able to manage them--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in various kinds of ways.  So we had a, had a good time with that.
Story_ID: 323155
Speaker 1: I got assigned from, from the platform, where I was teaching so many classes a day, to go down and manage the troops down in what was known as war training, because we would have them to do the classroom work, and then they'd have to go do some hands-on stuff.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And I managed the hands-on stuff--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --the hands-on activities that they had to go do (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So you're still working with them--
Speaker 1: That's right--
Speaker 2: --but you're--
Speaker 1: --yeah.
Speaker 2: --removed now from that classroom situation.
Speaker 1: That's right, yeah--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --which really in some ways was, was, I, I felt kind of bad about because that was the portion that I liked to do.  But this, doing these activities and teaching them those activities, was also a good, a good thing--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and turned out to be a very good assignment for me because this was the place that, because it was action-oriented, this was the place where all the generals came.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know what I'm saying?  And I had to be able to talk to the generals and do--and that same Major Bailey [Lois Bailey (ph.)] who told me that I didn't have enough experience--'cause I was a captain by this; I got promoted--the same Major Bailey said yeah, you go down there and do that.  She said I think you can handle that, so she put me down there.  And so, I thought I was going along pretty well since she, she managed to do, she trusted me to go to--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --her showplace, 'cause this was the showplace.  So I went down, and I dealt with the war training and dealt with the generals coming in.  And, and I would see them with all this entourage, and you know, everybody's watching them.  And always when generals come around they say, "What can I do for you, captain?"  You know, they always ask, "What can I do for you?"  And I would say to some of 'em, I'd say, "Listen, tell me about being a general (laughter)."  And they did; they started telling me about that.  They said, "Listen, you have a pretty good job right now, in that you got this job over here where you get a chance to brief generals and so forth.  They said you just keep doing your job and doing your work, and it'll come--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you see."  That's what they told me.  So I went.  I had a great time there [Fort Sam Houston, San Antonio, Texas].  Well, Major Bailey left.  She retired.  She decided she'd had enough 'cause she'd been in the [U.S.] Army almost thirty-five years.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so she decided she was going to retired, so she re- she was retiring.  And then we got a new person in, in her position.  And I'll tell you, that's when the world turned sour for me.  But you know--
Speaker 2: Now are we into 1966?
Speaker 1: Sixty-six [1966], right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Sixty-six [1966], yeah--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --sixty-six [1966], I remember very well.
Story_ID: 323156
Speaker 1: So Major Bailey [Lois Bailey (ph.)] retires.
Speaker 2: Right, yes.
Speaker 1: And who takes Major Bailey's place [at Fort Sam Houston, San Antonio, Texas]?
Speaker 2: You know, I have blocked that woman.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I do not remember her name.
Speaker 1: That's fine, that's fine.  Tell us about it.
Speaker 2: Moody.
Speaker 1: You--
Speaker 2: That's what it was, Major Moody [Louise Moody (ph.)].
Speaker 1: Okay, Major Moody.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I don't remember what her first name was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I was assigned, of course, during that assignment, and I thought I was doing very well in it.  Everybody said that, you know, I was doing very well.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And the things that were happening to me that were going to get to be disastrous, I didn't even know about them.  I mean, you know, I didn't, I, I did not see the train coming--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I will just tell you, because it was not, it was, no one talked to me; no one was talking to me about it.  But I got a call one day from the executive officer at the headquarters.  And he said, tell me to come and see him when I got finished with my class.  And San Antonio [Texas], I'm sure you remember, was warm the--most of the time--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --especially in May, yeah (laughter).  And I had been on the platform doing my thing, and I said I gotta go to headquarters.  Well, I just got myself up and went on up to the headquarters.  And I remember when I went in to talk to the XO [executive officer] the secretary said, "Colonel Bentley [ph.], would you like me to close the door?"  And he said, "Oh no.  He said I think whatever happens between Clara [HistoryMaker General Clara Adams-Ender] and I here we can handle (simultaneous)."
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, this was another Colonel Bailey.  He's the XO--
Speaker 2: No, Bent, Bentley, Bentley.
Speaker 1: Oh, Bentley, okay.
Speaker 2: Bentley was the XO of the command.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, medical--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --training center.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was the XO.  And, and so I went and talked with him, and he said, "I need to tell you today that I have got to show you your efficiency report, your officer efficiency report."  And so I said, oh, this is interesting.  I remember thinking: hm, nobody's ever done this before, so I wonder what's wrong.  So I read it, and then I understood because it was an adverse report.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was an adverse report.  I mean, we had a report in the [U.S.] Army at that time, and, and we, we have those reports.  And every time I see those little men, I tell you what.  But, you know, they had the, the bell curve kind of thing and how people fell out in distribution.  And they'd have one of the little men at the top, and then, and the biggest portion was the ones through the middle, and the you had the folk down here at the bottom, and the one person at the bottom that I always said held up all them other little men.  I was rated by my rater, by Major Moody down there at the bottom with all them other little men, with that one little man at the bottom.  And I still don't like that distribution (laughter).  I mean I was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) With no hint of this from Major Moody before?
Speaker 2: No hint at all, no message at all, nothing.  So I said, "I don't have a clue what this is all about."
Story_ID: 323157
Speaker 1: And so Colonel Bentley [ph.] had, was sitting in for the, the commander at that time to show me this, and he said I need for, he said, "I am just required to show you this report."  He said, "We have to send the report forward," and we sent it forward the first time.  And the Department of Army [U.S. Department of the Army] sent it back because they said that there's too much disparity in this report.  See, the, the rater [Louise Moody (ph.)] rated me very, very low, and we had an interviewer at that time--an intermediate, intermediate rater at that time.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And the intermediate rater rated me high, and the commander rated me high--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you see?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And they said there's too much disparity in this report.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Send it back and see if the rater will change it.  She refused to change the report.  And so they said she has refused to change the report for the second time, but we wanted you to know that we had to send it forward as it is.  So they send it forward, and oh, and what I didn't know about the Army at that time.  But I will tell you, you really learn a lot when adversity comes.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You probably learn a lot more from adversity than you do from successes--
Speaker 2: Right--
Speaker 1: --all the time.
Speaker 2: --absolutely.
Speaker 1: And I learned a lot that weekend about officer efficiency reports, how you write them, how you deal with them, how you appeal them, how you, how you protest, how you do all of those things as far as those reports are concerned.  But I had a good friend who was a sergeant in the [U.S.] Air Force at that time as a matter of fact.  And he said to me, he said, "Clara [HistoryMaker General Clara Adams-Ender]," he said, "Why are you having trouble about this?"  He said, "You're going to be a major (laughter)."  He said, "You're gonna be a major before too long, he said, because this disparity is going to cause a problem, he said, because some, somebody's gotta be wrong in this--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --situation," so, so he said don't even worry about it.  Well, I, I didn't believe him.  I just went ahead and worried about the, the thing and said my goodness, I was doing real well.  I mean, you know, I, and, and there were several other nurses who were there at the time who said Clara, the woman does not like you, and she does not like you because you're black.  He said but she will never say that out loud to you.  They said but we have heard certain kinds of statements being made, and if you want us to make statements, we will do that.  And so I said no, nobody needs to make any statements.  Now let's just let the whole thing alone.  So Lil Dunlap [Lillian Dunlap] received--she's now a full colonel--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --she received this report in Washington [D.C.].  And there's a process that gets done, that gets dealt with.  The long and short of it is the report went to the Army Board of Corrections, we've called the ABC, and they threw what the rater had to say; they threw out what the reviewer had to say; and they doubled the score from the, for the intermediate rater.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I went to the head of the class.
Story_ID: 323385
Speaker 1: We have a dramatic event happening here (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, right.
Speaker 1: This report has gotten back to Washington [D.C.].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Major Moody [Louise Moody (ph.)] is saying you're at the bottom of your post.  The reviewer has said you had a very, you should have a very favorable rating.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And now, it's in the hands of the people here in Washington.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And now what do the people here at Washington decide?
Speaker 2: Well, they decided they should throw out the information that Major Moody had given, which was the adverse report, and they should throw out the raters, and, and then double the score from the, from the endorser or the, the intermediate person that we had there.  And that still gave me a very good score--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you see.  But not only did they do that, there was a board that met to consider the captains for that year to be promoted in the [U.S.] Army Nurse Corps.  And after they considered all the captains that were, that were within the zone of promotion, then they looked at the ones who were, the, the captains that were one year below the zone of promotion, you see.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my name was in there.
Speaker 1: Now wait a minute.  I, we, we hadn't promoted you from lieutenant.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, we got to captain.  We got to captain just before we left the career course.
Speaker 1: Ah-ha--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --now we have to go back then.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 1: We, we, 'cause we skipped that.
Speaker 2: All right, okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah.
Speaker 1: You left the career course--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --nineteen sixty-five [1965].
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: I was promoted to captain that September.
Speaker 1: And you were promoted to captain.
Speaker 2: Went straight, yeah, right.
Speaker 1: Well, did you, had you done anything special or, or they just threw your name--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --into the pot and promoted you?
Speaker 2: Well, I, well, I think one of the things was that my record looked very good in Washington, in that I got to go that career course as a lieutenant, which you seldom, I mean that's almost a guarantee of a promotion, you see.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, okay, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I had my, my efficiency reports before that time had all been very good you know, I mean outstanding as a matter of fact. And so that's how I managed to, to get that done, yeah.
Speaker 1: So in September of 1965 you were promoted to captain.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, you got two bars.
Speaker 2: That's right, yeah.
Speaker 1: You bad.
Speaker 2: And then it was just, it was just, what, was '66 [1966]?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I made the list for major.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And the thing, the thing that was, the thing--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --that was really important about that time was that I got picked, what folks say, below the zone, you see, because they had the zone--the folks that were within the zone of promotion, and then they looked at the next year--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --of people, the next year group after that, to see if there was anybody down in that, in that particular level that was really very outstanding and outstanding enough to be added to this board that was getting ready to go out.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And I was one of them people.
Speaker 1: Now, 1966, that's when Major Bailey [Lois Bailey (ph.)] left, and Major Louise Moody took over (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, right, yeah.
Speaker 1: And you were captain at that--
Speaker 2: No, she came in '65 [1965].  I think she was in--
Speaker 1: Oh, oh--
Speaker 2: No, I went down there [Fort Sam Houston, San Antonio, Texas] in '65 [1965].  Yeah, it was '66 [1966], right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I was a captain.  I got promoted--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to captain, right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so when you--when Major Louise Moody took over for Major Bailey--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --you were a captain.
Speaker 2: I was a captain, that's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was a captain at that time.
Speaker 1: Good enough.
Story_ID: 323386
Speaker 1: The other thing that was happening: because I had talked to Colonel Dunlap [Lillian Dunlap], who was now in Washington [D.C.] at this point, before she left, she told me, she said, "You have to make a decision as to whether or not you are going to stay on active duty or whether or not you're going to, to leave at some point."  She said, "And I will tell you, you can't do anything else in the [U.S.] Army unless you look like you're going to stay."  So she highly recommended that I become a regular Army officer, you know, which I did.  I put in my papers--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --in order to become a regular Army officer.  So then--
Speaker 2: After you had made captain?
Speaker 1: That's right, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I put in papers to become a regular Army officer, and, and so that's what I did; I became--well, actually, I had done, I had put in the papers while I was still a lieutenant.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But I didn't make it until after I was a captain--
Speaker 2: Okay--
Speaker 1: --you see.
Speaker 2: --but no.
Speaker 1: And, and then, of course, 'cause you're on probation for three years, you see, after that.  And so they, but they took me in because I wanted to apply, I had to apply to school 'cause they had planned to send me to school.  And see, Major Moody [Louise Moody (ph.)] knew that if I got this adverse report at this time, I could kiss school goodbye because you don't send folks off with that kind of--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Well, I was really trying to get that report taken care of and before the board [Army Board of Corrections] met so we could see exactly what was going on as far as that was concerned, but Colonel Dunlap took care of all that--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --whatever was necessary.  And I think what she did was, she reported to the board what was happening and the fact that, that the intermediate rater should be the one that was reviewed because that was the only report I had in there, was from the intermediate rater.  They threw the others out.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, and, and so they rated me based on that.
Speaker 2: Good.
Speaker 1: And they sent me off to school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I got selected for school.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: But there was another, and, and this was really very--I mean it is very difficult to be accused of things that you did not do and yet, not have anybody give you an opportunity to defend yourself.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But it is also very heartening to know that you can have supervisors and leaders who know full well that it's not true what has happened, and so you don't have to defend yourself--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know.  I--
Speaker 2: That's--
Speaker 1: After that, after I got that report, I had to go up and see the commander one day.  And he handed me a, a staff report that had been done by Major Moody and her friend that--and that was part of the problem with my getting the adverse report, was that she wanted to put her friend in this particular job that I was in.  And the commander didn't want to move me because he said, "It's working fine (laughter)."  He said, "She greet, meets, and greets people, and she does very well with the troops," and he knew this other woman did not do that.  And so he said no, we're, we, we're not gonna permit you to move her.  You, we, she's got to stay there.  And so she, of course, wrote this report on the side that said that the sergeant who was the NCOIC, the non-commissioned officer in charge, of the war training section, that he and I were stealing supplies from that area.
Speaker 2: Now, who, who wrote this?
Speaker 1: This is Major Moody and her friend.  So, there I was.
Speaker 2: That's a major charge.  That's not an adverse report.
Speaker 1: Oh, Lord, well, that was--and so the, she sent it up to the commander, and the commander called me and told me he had gotten this report.  And he said, "I'm not even going to dignify it with a response," he said, "because I know it's not happening, you see."  He said, "And the proof is not here in the paper."  You know, she had no, no proof of the, the difference between the numbers of supplies that was sent and those--she just made an accusation--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know.  But he--
Speaker 2: Without any substantiation.
Speaker 1: Without any substantiation at all.  And I said how could this be?  But I have found since that time, you know, people can do most anything and will--
Speaker 2: Right--
Speaker 1: --you know.
Speaker 2: --and the more--
Speaker 1: And it had nothing to do with me.
Speaker 2: --and the more ignorant they are, the more they'll do.
Speaker 1: That's right, indeed.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And it had nothing to do with me; it had to do with what she was trying to do to advance her own cause.  So he said, "I'll tell you what I'm gonna do: I'm gonna give you a copy of this report, captain," he said, "and I want you to take a look at it every time you're out there doing good and believe that everybody else thinks you're doing good."  I learned a lesson that day.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And I never forgot it.  And I'll tell you, I never got rid of that report until I made the list for full colonel (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: When I made the list for full colonel I said listen, free at last (laughter).  It never harmed me in any way--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but I do remember that hap--that was probably one of my lowest times in the [U.S.] military--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --one of my lowest times, 'cause I didn't have very low times; I had a great career, and I had a great time in the military.  But that was one of my lowest times because I felt helpless to be able to do anything about my situation, and people were making accusations that were not true.  But I also felt good about the fact that there were people who said, we know it didn't happen, and so we ain't even gonna look into it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We're not gonna dignify it.
Speaker 1: And we're not even gonna dignify it with, with investigations, so forget it.  So they didn't, didn't do even anything with it.
Story_ID: 323387
Speaker 1: Major Bailey [Lois Bailey (ph.)] has helped out, and you have gotten this fine report.  This adverse report has been (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's gone.
Speaker 1: --turned into a fine report.
Speaker 2: That's right, fine report.
Speaker 1: Let's, let's come back to where we were.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And they've, they've corrected that, that report.
Speaker 2: Right, corrected--
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: --that report.
Speaker 1: --and you're still at Fort Sam Houston [San Antonio, Texas].
Speaker 2: Fort, still at Fort Sam Houston teaching.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and the next year, of course, coming off of '67 [1967]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --yeah, and in '67 [1967], in March of that year I got the message that I was going to school--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that I'd been selected to go to long-term civilian's training.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now that's graduate school--and that I needed to pick a school and get myself admitted.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I did.
Speaker 1: What school did you select?
Speaker 2: University of Minnesota [University of Minnesota Twin Cities, Minneapolis, Minnesota].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they had a great nursing school at that time, and, and still do.  They still, still have a great one, but they, they had a very good nursing school.  The tuition was not too high, matter fact one of the lowest in the country for the--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the, the credits.  They were still on a quarter system.  And I could finish within two years and get my master's [degree] in medical-surgical nursing.
Speaker 1: And the [U.S.] Army was going to pay the full tuition?
Speaker 2: The Army paid.  The Army paid--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --full tuition, room and board, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you accepted in March of '67 [1967].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: When did you start school?
Speaker 2: I started school that August.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, started school in August, so I had to get finished there at Fort Sam Houston, get the, you know, the, get myself ready to get moved to Minnesota.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, great.  And--
Speaker 2: That was interesting.
Speaker 1: --any interesting memories from the August of '67 [1967], for the next two years there at the University of Minnesota?
Speaker 2: Well, there were a number of, of, of stimulating experiences.  The thing I remember more than anything else was the weather.  I had been down at Fort Sam Houston for, for three years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And down there, it was warm most of the time, okay.  And then I moved up to Minnesota and got there in August, and it was pretty good in August, but then in September it started to get a little cool.  The temperature dipped down to 35 degrees (laughter).  And you know, you gotta get the setting right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: This is 1967.  You know, we had the flower children and the hippies that were all around the world, and they didn't wear shoes.  Whenever, whenever it got down to 35 degrees they put their sandals on (laughter).  So, and here I had on two coats already.  They, the laughed at me; they absolutely laughed at me at that university.  They said listen, it's not cold yet.  Wait until it gets to fifty below.  And I waited, and it did (laughter).  Let me tell you, I remember the cold times more than anything else.  But you can adjust to most anything--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --that goes on, and that was just adaptation.  But I had thin blood, coming from San Antonio [Texas] with all that warm weather, and I had to get ready.  I'll tell, the folks at ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps], I used to go and visit them very often 'cause they were the representatives of the Army on campus.  And I'd go over there and see them and talk to them.  And what I when I finally came out in the spring of '68 [1968], they said oh, you're a little person.  We thought you were big, fat (laughter).  The PFS [physical fitness school] said, "I was really worried about your weight control."  I said it was nothing but all them three or four coats I had on (laughter).  But graduate school was a different experience, but it was a great experience.
Story_ID: 323388
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Any memorable teachers [at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities, Minneapolis, Minnesota]?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, oh yes, there were, there, there's one that I still keep in contact with.  She was single at the time.  It was really very interesting because she was single at the time, and she got married after we left there--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you know, got married later in her life.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we kept in touch with her.  But, but she taught me--
Speaker 1: What, what was her name?
Speaker 2: Marilyne Backlund [Marilyne Backlund Gustafson]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: M-A-R-I-L-Y-N-E.
Speaker 1: B-A--
Speaker 2: C-K-L-U-N-D.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I just saw her a few years ago, yeah, and she's doing quite well--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, being that a couple of 'em died that was there.  And, and one of my teachers, and this is how I learned about networking in this life because--and how important it was to do--because one of my professors, she was a professor that ran the program, the medical-surgical nursing program.  And no, she was the, she was the assistant dean there, yeah, in for the baccalaureate program--I mean for the master's [degree] program.  And she was a good friend of the, the director of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Nursing [Washington, D.C.] program--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --at that time, because that's where I wanted to go and teach afterwards.  See, that's why I had to get my master's degree so that I could go and teach in that program.
Speaker 1: Okay, what was her name now?
Speaker 2: Who, the, the dean of that--
Speaker 1: Yes, who you became friendly with and headed up the Walter Reed--
Speaker 2: Oh, that was Drusilla Poole, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Drusilla, a colonel, she was a colonel, Drusilla, D-R-U-S-I-L-L-A, Poole.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she's also dead now but great gal.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She and oh, Lord, Dr. Isabel, Isabel Harris [M. Isabel Harris]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --was, she was the dean of the graduate program--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at the university.  She found out that I was from the [U.S.] Army whenever, you know, I was introducing them to our sales and time--type thing.  And so, then she came and to me and she said listen, she said, "Do you happen to know a Colonel Drusilla Poole?"  And I said yes.  I said she's, as a matter of fact, she's the director of the Army school of nursing at Walter Reed [Walter Reed Army Medical Center; Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland], you know, in Washington [D.C.].  She said yes, I know.  She said she's a very good friend of mine.  I said well, I'd like to go to that school.  She said okay, when you get ready I'll write you a letter.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And that's exactly what she did, sat there and wrote me a letter.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we--
Speaker 1: This followed up your two years getting your master?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is, yeah, yeah, that's what I did after that.
Story_ID: 323389
Speaker 1: Probably the longest, well, it was the longest assignment I ever had, 'cause I stayed at that school of nursing for five years.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: Yeah, had a great time.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now when you say you--oh, oh you mean the Walter Reed school of--
Speaker 1: Yes, the Walter Reed school of nursing [Walter Reed Army Institute of Nursing, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Okay, good enough
Speaker 1: Yeah, I taught that--I taught--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --there, yeah.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: But I was at the university, university [University of Minnesota Twin Cities, Minneapolis, Minnesota] to get my master's [degree] was two years.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, and this was the first time I had ever taught, you see, on the, on the university level, so it was very interesting getting into that.
Speaker 2: Okay, so, while you were getting your master's you were also teaching?
Speaker 1: Had to do student teaching.  Right, we had to do--
Speaker 2: Student teaching there.
Speaker 1: --student teaching there, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I did my student teaching with the South Dakota State University [Brookings, South Dakota].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That was at Brookings [South Dakota].  It was a, Brookings, South Dakota, but it was a, we used to call it a roving school at that time because they didn't have enough facilities in South Dakota for them to be able to do their clinical experiences there.  So they came, they packed up all the students and everything and brought them to St. Paul [Minnesota] to one of the hospitals there to do their, their clinical experiences.  And so I had to go from Minneapolis [Minnesota] over to St. Paul to teach them.  I have never been to Brookings, South Dakota (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay (laughter), all right.
Speaker 1: But would just, they, they--
Speaker 2: They came to you.
Speaker 1: That's right: they came to me over in that place.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that was, that was wonderful.  We had a great time, yeah--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --yeah.
Speaker 2: So now, we're talking about 1969.
Speaker 1: Right, yes.
Speaker 2: And you have finished your master's program (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's right, got out of it--
Speaker 2: --successfully.
Speaker 1: --successfully gradu-
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: --hallelujah.
Speaker 2: --you are interested in moving on to Walter Reed.
Speaker 1: That's right, 'cause I want to teach nurses, yeah.  Well, actually, I really wanted to go to Vietnam--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --because any [U.S.] Army nurse who does not get in the thick of taking care of troops in a war zone when they, when there's a war on, is not what we came to do, you know.  And so I thought, Jesus, to be back here teaching during this period of time is not the place I need to be.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But, I was told that because of the fact that I was already a trainer, and they didn't have time to teach other trainers, that I had to stay there and keep on doing the training.  They said, "Listen, we don't need majors in Vietnam; we need lieutenants."  And so I had to go to Walter Reed and send lieutenants, and get lieutenants prepared to go to Korea--I mean to go to Vietnam.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and so because it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And--
Speaker 1: --really heating up a lot then--
Story_ID: 323390
Speaker 1: I want to be sure that I did not miss it.  I may have cut you off, but I think you were promoted to major--
Speaker 2: Not yet.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't get that--well, I did in graduate school [at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities, Minneapolis, Minnesota].  I got promoted in February of 1969.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: And, and we had not recorded that?
Speaker 2: No, we had not recorded it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, that's right: we had not recorded that.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And that was a great occasion because (laughter), because I gave a big party.  I mean, you know, I'm a big time major now (laughter).  I've graduated my stu- my sister, two sisters (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do you remember--
Speaker 2: --from college.
Speaker 1: --the date that you became major?
Speaker 2: I don't, but I can give it to you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I can give it to you later.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: Sixty-eight [1968]?
Speaker 2: I got promoted in '68 [1968], yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: February, I know it's February.  We had the party--
Speaker 1: And you were getting to tell us about a big party that you--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that you gave yourself.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I gave, I gave, right, gave a big par- well, not only for myself, my classmates, and I invited them all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: See, because they didn't know anything about the [U.S.] military services and the people--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in the military service.  So I said listen, when we get promoted we have great occasions, and as a result of that, we're gonna have this party.  Because they had the reservist up there, and they had Fort Snelling [Hennepin County, Minnesota]--I was just by there not too long ago, and it's closed, and they are trying to make it a historic site--but they had--and Fort Snelling had one of the greatest clubs in the world, so we went out there.  And, and you could, you could bar.  It's real cheap.  So I went out there and I told 'em I wanted to give a party for fifty people.  And they set me up, and they provided all the hors d'oeuvres and all the drinks and everything, and I entertained folks for a couple of hours.  I'll tell you--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --we had a great time.  You remember the lindy hop?
Speaker 1: Sure do.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) We were out there doing the lindy and going under the, the, you know, having the big boss line and going under the, under the, the, what's the--rod and everything they were holding.  We had a marvelous time.  They said, you all sure do know how to give parties (laughter).  We had a great time.  And I invited all the folks from ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because they, you know, they, they really knew the tradition.  And so they said oh yeah, we'll come help you celebrate (laughter), so they did.  We had a great time.
Speaker 1: Any other outstanding things around your promotion to, to major?
Speaker 2: What else?  No, no--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --we just had the big party.
Story_ID: 323391
Speaker 1: And of course, during this time in--there was always that excitement around, 'cause you know, during this time, there was the war [Vietnam War] going on.  And we had a lot of folks that were not at all interested in the war going on.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So we had a lot of protesting.  And University of Minnesota [University of Minnesota Twin Cities, Minneapolis, Minnesota] is probably one of the most radical campuses in this country for causes, social causes.  They are really very, very big on social causes, and they had a lot of people that were big on the war.  I used to sit in the, in the, in the university square and debate people about the war and if, you know--and then after a while, you know, I'd tell 'em that was on active duty.  I didn't have to wear a uniform there, you see.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: No, you did not wear a uniform to classes and stuff.  You went in your regular street clothes and that type thing.  And, but I'd go and debate people (laughter) and tell 'em about, you know, why we were there and what the country was about.  And oh, goodness, it was a time, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now there came a time, of course, now you graduated.  You got your master's degree.
Speaker 1: That's right, yep.
Speaker 2: And you have a choice between trying to get to Vietnam--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --or trying to get to Walter Reed [Walter Reed Army Institute of Nursing, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: So you studied that issue long and hard.
Speaker 1: I did, yes.  And Lil Dunlap [Lillian Dunlap] is still around in my life.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But she's retired by this time, you know.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: So I called her up, and I said, "Listen, I want to go to Vietnam."  And she said, "Well, what does the [U.S.] Army say?"  And she says, "You know they didn't send you to school for nothing (laughter)."  She said, "They didn't send you to school to send you to Vietnam either."
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So then she was the one who explained this to me about the needs of the service and how it was far more important for me to send three lieutenants than to go myself.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I said, "Well, I guess."  She said, "So you go right on over there to Walter Reed, and you teach those lieutenants, and you do good at that."  She said, "Because I know you can handle it, and keep in touch."
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So I did; I went right on.  She helped me out a lot, I'll tell you.
Speaker 2: And that put both of you hear in Washington [D.C.], right?
Speaker 1: No, no, she was back in San Antonio [Texas] then.  She--
Speaker 2: Oh, she was back in San Antonio.
Speaker 1: She retired to home, oh yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: She retired to home.  Yeah, she was finished, and so she retired down in San Antonio.  But before she retired, of course, she moved on--I, I think I left her last in working in the Office of the Surgeon General in Washington, in the [U.S.] Army Nurse Corps branch.  Well, by this time, she'd moved on to be chief of the Corps, had done her four years as chief of the Corps and then retired--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --after that, yeah, yeah--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and had made general.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: Yes, and made general.
Speaker 2: Oh, all right.
Speaker 1: Right, she made general.  She made general before I did, yeah--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 323392
Speaker 1: So you came back to, or you, you went to Washington [D.C.], Walter Reed [Walter Reed Army Institute of Nursing].
Speaker 2: Right, yes, that's where the school was, yeah.
Speaker 1: And okay, tell us what your title was and how, what your responsibilities were.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I was, I, I, you know, I, I really wanted to go to Vietnam, but if I didn't get to Vietnam, I certainly got the assignment that I wanted and that was to go to teach in the [U.S.] Army school of nursing.  And the Army school of nursing was the Walter Reed Army Institute of Nursing center of the University of Maryland.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: You see, because we don't award, we don't award academic degrees--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in the [U.S.] military, with the, with one exception.  But we don't award them in most of our schools.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We just have one school where we award academic degrees but none in, none of the others.  And so we had to be under the aegis of an academic institution that could award the degrees.  And the University of Maryland said that they would do that.  So, I was assigned as an instructor first at the University of Maryland with assignment to the Walter Reed Army Institute of Nursing center.  And what we had at Walter Reed was, we had the same complement of students that they--in nursing, that they had at, on the campus of the University of Maryland at Baltimore [Maryland].
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause that's where their professional schools are.  Their professional schools are up in Baltimore, you know physicians, nurses, dentists, all them people up in Baltimore.  So we had the same complement, and that was about 250 students, you see, on both campuses, you see.  But the, the Army then paid for those of us who were assigned to the Walter Reed Army Institute of Nursing center, paid our salaries and everything else, you know, see.  And the University of Maryland just awarded us the academic titles and those that was that was necessary, yeah.  And I didn't mind that arrangement at all because (laughter) the Army paid me a helluva lot more money as a major--
Speaker 1: What--
Speaker 2: --than they paid that, that instar- being an instructor on the faculty at the University of Maryland would have paid me at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) So, so I was there.
Speaker 1: Now approximately how many students did you have--you, you were over all of the students--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --in that program?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Drusilla Poole was the director.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Remember, I, so she was a colonel.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: She was a colonel.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I was just a major then, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was a colonel at that time, and she was the director of the entire program.
Story_ID: 322254
Speaker 1: You have arrived in Washington [D.C.].  You're gonna be teaching (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I've arrived in Washington.
Speaker 1: --lieutenants to send them to Vietnam.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And you are there under the direction of Drusilla Poole.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay, what was it like?  Tell us about your experiences there [Walter Reed Army Institute of Nursing, Washington, D.C.] in setting up your classes and so forth.
Speaker 2: Oh, that was marvelous.  You know, I, I knew nothing about university teaching, knew nothing about working on a university level 'cause I hadn't done that before.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But I had spent my time at graduate school [University of Minnesota Twin Cities, Minneapolis, Minnesota], so I had an opportunity to observe and see what people did and, and, and the interactions and relationships that went on between the departments and that type of thing.  So, so I had some idea about how to, to be a faculty member.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I'll tell you, it was a lot harder than, than I had realized.  It's, there's a lot more to getting, to doing classes than just presenting them.  You know, there's a lot that goes into the preparation, and, and deciding what happens in the curriculum, and, and dealing with those ideas with a number of other people who have ideas of yours, but don't have ideas of yours.  And so we spent a lot of time in the medical-surgical nursing section, 'cause that's the, the group I was with, dealing with those issues of how best to teach these students and what needed to be taught to them and that type of thing.  It was very interesting though: one of the things that-- because this was, this was the third time that the [U.S.] Army school of nursing had been opened all right.  And, and what happened often was as soon as they got the numbers of nurses that they needed, because it was opened usually whenever they needed them in times of war, whenever they got the numbers that they needed, then they'd close down the school.  Well, then they go to close down the school, and then you go back to a shortage again.  And that's what the shortage is all about, is, the shortages of nurses is about the fact that nobody fixes it forever.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's what they need to do to get in, they need to get into fix, fixing it forever, but I digress (laughter).  I decided that at that time I was gonna get involved in doing those things that were necessary to make sure that these students got taught well.  So, I spent a lot of time talking to people about the program and, and, and a lot of time in the library studying to make sure that I could get the information that I needed.
Story_ID: 322255
Speaker 1: The other thing that I did not tell you at this ti- before was that in my personal life, of course I'd been single up until this point, and in my personal life, I had decided that I was gonna marry my high school sweetheart--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --you see, so I did, in ja- two weeks before I arrived at that school, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay, and--
Speaker 1: That was interesting.
Speaker 2: --and his name was?
Speaker 1: Is James Kelso Adams.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Yep.  So he came along to Washington [D.C.] with me.  He had never left North Carolina from before.  And, and we'd know one another in high school, and he'd gone to a trade school to be a brick mason (unclear) so that's what he did.  Unfortunately, in Washington he couldn't get work as a brick mason because he didn't belong to the union, and if you don't belong to the union you couldn't get in--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in this area.  So, he decided that he, he wanted to go back to school to be an auto mechanic, and so he did.  And so he did that and, and got good work and that type of thing afterwards, so we were, you know, we were humming along.  And I was over there teaching the students, you see, at Walter Reed [Walter Reed Army Institute of Nursing, Washington, D.C.], and I spent a, spent a lot of time doing that.  And so that worked out very well, and, and I was able then to, to deal with my, my work and, and do the things that were necessary to get the students taught.  I--
Speaker 2: And the year that, that we are talking about now is nine--
Speaker 1: That I got married?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-nine [1969].
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-nine [1969]?
Speaker 1: Right, yes, July 12th, day after my thirtieth birthday.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-nine [1969].
Speaker 2: July 12th, my son's birthday.
Speaker 1: Is that right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: See, my birthday is the 11th.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: The, the, and I'm trying to pull my notes here together.  So you got married and then moved here to Washington to accept--
Speaker 1: Moved here to Washington.
Speaker 2: --to accept your new, new assignment.
Speaker 1: My position, right, yeah.
Speaker 2: And now, something I wanted to bring in here, so I'm glad we did have that break of your getting, getting married.  Where did you get married, by the way?
Speaker 1: I got married in Glenarden, Maryland, you know.
Speaker 2: Know it well.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: In fact, I'm only about twenty minutes from Glenarden--
Speaker 1: Oh, is that right.
Speaker 2: --where I live.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and my girlfriend lived out there at the time.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: She and her husband now are down in southern Virginia, but she lived there at the time.  And, and she and I had known one another in Korea, so, yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay, okay.  Now, I wanted to, because we've been going over a lot of years here, and I don't want to miss your family life--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --your, your pers- family life, your mom [Caretha Sapp Leach]--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --and your dad [Otha Leach].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: How are they doing?
Speaker 1: Yes, they're doing fine at this time.  I, and I'm going home more often too.  I found out that that was important to do, so every chance I had an opportunity I would go down to see them, you know 'cause they're getting older at this time, and this is '69 [1969].  My brother, who is, was in the [U.S.] Air Force, is still in the Air Force at this time, but he told me that--
Speaker 2: Which one is this, Ray [Raymond Leach]?
Speaker 1: This is Ray, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He told me that as soon as he got an opportunity he was gonna retire, first time--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --he got an opportunity, and he did--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --in '75 [1975] and went back home and stayed, yeah.  So that I'm, I'm spending a lot of time, you know, we've got telephones in the country now, so I can call them up.  And so I called my mother every Sunday and talked to her and did that, and so we're, we're doing real good, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, good enough.  I just wanted you, you know, for them to come along in that history and--
Speaker 1: Yes, absolutely.
Speaker 2: --and chronology--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and so forth.
Story_ID: 322256
Speaker 1: Now we're there.  You're finding out that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We're there at Walter Reed [Walter Reed Army Institute of Nursing, Washington, D.C.] teaching and--
Speaker 1: --teaching here at this newly reopened nursing school is not as easy as you thought it was gonna be.
Speaker 2: As I thought it was gonna be.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I don't know why I thought it was gonna be easy.  Well, I thought it was gonna be easy 'cause I liked it, you see.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But there are another, a number of things that you have to deal with in, in universities, and that's the administration and plus you always have to deal with the rules of the school and, and the rule--and another thing that was really complicating the whole business of getting teaching done and that type of thing was the war [Vietnam War]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and the opposition to the war.  And I, I have talked to people, talked to people at periods of time, various times, period of time in, in both in, when I was in and out of the [U.S.] military.  And a lot of folk who've never been in the military believe that the only thing we do is blindly follow orders without question.  Oh, they should have heard some of the debates that went on about the war (laughter).  Oh, there were lots of debates that went on even with those little medics down in Fort Sam Houston [San Antonio, Texas] who volunteered to come in, you see.  They had their own feelings about it too.  And I used to give 'em an opportunity to express their feelings.  I said well, we still gotta get our work done, and so we still do our work. So, when we got to Walter Reed, of course, there were all of these things, and, and, and we had our debates and so forth.  I, and I tell my civilian friends very often the one major difference between our debate and your debate is that when someone says now here's what we're gonna do, we salute and move out--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --you see.  Before that time debates over--
Speaker 1: The debate is--
Speaker 2: The debate is over.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: It's time to go.  And so we took care of that.  But we got there and I had a number of students who said I don't think in good conscience I can do this; I would really like to go.  And a number of them would do it at the time of graduation.  They would say: hey, listen, I'm getting married, or I'm doing whatever, and I don't feel like in good conscience I can go.  And they let 'em out the program.  I never thought that was right, but it went on.  But a number of them wanted to come and talk about it and in various places.  And the thing that would happen was I didn't want to jeopardize their positions.  And, and, and I didn't want them to know that, you know, we were talking about the fact that, that they were thinking about getting out of the military.  And I didn't want the wrong ears to hear this stuff, so I would take them off the base to a little restaurant or someplace somewhere, and we'd sit down and we'd talk about what it is they, they, they'd want to talk about.  And I was selected I guess because they considered me one of the open faculty members that they could, indeed, talk to, and, and I would get asked a lot to do this.  And some people would say: hey, listen, this is what I'm feeling at this time; this is what I'm thinking, and I don't think I can go off in good conscience and do this; and they said it was a mistake for me to join.  And I said if that's the way you feel about it, you probably ought to get out now, you see.  And so, some of them did, some of them did during that period.
Speaker 1: Now let's understand, they weren't asking always to get out of the service.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: They were just saying they didn't want to go to, to Vietnam (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Vietnam, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, they didn't want to go to Vietnam.  And some of them, you know, they didn't always know if they were gonna go or not.  But, you know, they said if I get asked to go to Vietnam, I think I'm gonna have to leave.  And, and we were, that was a way that you could, could go at that time.  Later on, they started saying if you, if you do this you'll have to pay your money back, you see, over this here.  But in the beginning they didn't have any mechanism by which to do that.  So we--but I would always sit down and give 'em an opportunity to talk about it and let 'em think about, you know, what was going on.  And whatever they decided, that's what they decided.  And of course, that's what, that's what went on--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --at that point.  But it was a, it was a, it was a turbulent time for us.  And, and it was a challenge for teachers because, especially those that were willing to talk to people.  Now those folks who never wanted to talk, they didn't get bothered at all (laughter).  But, but for some of us who were willing to talk to nurses--I mean to the students, and to the students and, and to challenge them and to, and to tell 'em think about this and think about that because, you know, I've always thought that the people who were on active duty at the time got a real bad rap in terms of what goes on as far as the mil- the, the country is concerned.  The war belongs to all of us (laughter), you know.  I mean any time you go out and do anything that, that means that you pay taxes and you are participating, you see.  And so, I said you know, this is just a little bit closer, up closer and personal, because (laughter) you need to know that no matter where you are, as long as you stay in this country, you are a part of the war effort.  And they said oh, we never thought about that.  Well, I'd be rather over here--I'd be, rather be over here where it's well-defined than to go someplace else.  And so we had, we had a lot of discussions during those times.  I must say that the students grew up a lot during that period, and so did I.
Story_ID: 322257
Speaker 1: But at the same time, of course, as, as I said, I was a married individual at that period, and--
Speaker 2: Another challenge for you.
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --yeah, new and different, I'll tell ya.  But the one thing that I tried to do, and, and, and I will be the first to confess, and I have done this many times; I wrote about it in my book ['My Rise to the Stars: How a Sharecropper's Daughter Became an Army General,' Clara Adams-Ender], that I did not get married for the right reasons.  I mean I got married 'cause I had some time to kill, you know.  I had, I was way ahead--you know, I always had a game plan, you know, in terms of what I wanted to do.  And I was about four years ahead of my game plan.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I said well, you know, I made this promise long time ago, and, and, and now he [James Kelso Adams] says either do what you're gonna do, or we're gonna move on.  I guess I'd better go do this, so I went ahead and did it.  Not good enough reason, but I did it.  And I tell people I did what I was supposed to do when I got married, and I did what I was supposed to do when I got out of it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Because he was really not willing.  He said he was, but he really, really was not willing to do those things that were necessary for me to stay in the [U.S.] military.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And I had made it very clear--
Speaker 2: That you were going--
Speaker 1: --by that time.
Speaker 2: --to stay in the military.
Speaker 1: That I was gonna stay in the military.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I was very clear up front that I was going to stay.  But I kept hearing some, some, some information that, that led me to believe that he was not interested in being a part of that.  And I said that's cool, you know.  You're not interested in me.  You don't have to be a part of this.  And so, he decided that he would go home and hang out with his brothers until I came to my senses.
Speaker 2: Okay, what year was that?
Speaker 1: That was, let me see.  I was at (unclear) and--let me work this year out.  That must have been '72 [1972].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, '72 [1972], right, 'cause I was divorced in '74 [1974], yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so I made the choices that I needed to, you know, to make, in terms of dealing with that whole situation, and he went back home, and he never returned.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And I, I got a legal separation immediately, but--well, not immediately.  It took me about a couple of months, but I wa- I didn't do anything about getting divorced--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --until I found out I had to go and have some major surgery.  When I found out I had to have some major surgery, I felt I'd best set the record straight--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --before I went out.  So, I, I got divorced in 1974.
Story_ID: 322258
Speaker 1: Now, in the meantime, you are teaching these youngsters (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, yes.
Speaker 1: --there the at Walter Reed Army Institute of Nursing [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Army Institute of Nursing, right.
Speaker 1: And I imagine the majority of that class was still male.  Am I correct?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Oh, it was female?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Well, most of these were female, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, because these people were going overseas, and didn't know they were sending that many women overseas at that time.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, nurses.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: Oh, they've always had nurses.  See, see, I've always--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --told people nurses always got an opportunity to go 'cause they were needed--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --you see.  Had there not been--they were not sending many women of, of too many other ilks at that time overseas.  But the nurses always got to go.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and nurses in the [U.S.] military most of the time were women, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, most of the nurses all over are women.  We have more men, we have more male nurses in the [U.S.] Army, which is about now 27 percent of the corps [U.S. Army Nurse Corps].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --than they do in the population in general.  Population in general has about 4 percent.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But in the--
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: --but they joined in the military because they know they're gonna have to do their obligation, and so they just join.  Since they could join as nurses, they just go into nursing.  And they'd make career choices very quickly, and so they just move right on up.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they do.  They do a lot of, lot of good positions these days.
Story_ID: 322259
Speaker 1: By the way, how did your parents respond to your separation and later divorce, your mom [Caretha Sapp Leach], your dad [Otha Leach]?  Not your brothers; I don't want it (laughter), I'm sure.
Speaker 2: My, my mother was a, was very supportive through all of this--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, because she'd known, I say that known since, since eighth grade, and so she knew, you know, the person, that type.  And my father never liked it because he was not a college graduate and all those other kind of things.  And he said you, he said you're setting yourself up for trouble in this, in this situation, and so he was happy when it ended.  He didn't have any problem with it all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mother said well, you have done what I thought you ought to do and that was you got married.  Now the fact that you didn't stay, that's your problem.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: She said I don't care about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So she said I think you, you had that experience.  Now you can move on to the next thing.  So, I just kept on moving, but they were both very supportive--
Story_ID: 322260
Speaker 1: Any memorable events in your career there at Walter Reed [Walter Reed Army Institute of Nursing, Washington, D.C.] that we should know about?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: One major one you should know about.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The, and I guess the time when I got into it was the summer of 1972.  But when I went to, when I came to Walter Reed [Walter Reed Army Medical Center; Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland] in 1969, to that school, I noticed for some reason or another, could not explain it to myself, but noticed for some reason or another, it was 99 and 44, 100 percent white folks.  I said there's something wrong with this picture.  This is not what America looks like.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It's not even what our [U.S.] Army looks like.  Now what are we doing here?  Well, they said they couldn't recruit African Americans to the school because of the fact that they were choosing to go to other places like Smith [Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts] and Wesley--Wellesley [Wellesley College, Wellesley, Massachusetts] and Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and that those, the ba- I said well, listen, now there, there's some just regular students like me (laughter) that I know could go places.  Well, one of the things that I found out was that it's where you recruit that you find the people that you--they had sent the information out to the Army, across the Army.  But in those positions at that time, they were in positions of being general or being sergeant may, sergeants major.  You know, most of those folks were white--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and so they didn't pass the information on to the other people, so the folk wasn't getting the message.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So we decided that we'd make sure we got the message out, you see, to folks, and of course, that started to change the, the flavor of things.  Well, it wasn't changing fast enough for a group of, of African Americans that were there at Walter Reed at that time, so, that were assigned at Walter Reed.  And so that summer I'm trying to deal with this separation that I'm dealing with, and they are saying listen, we are going to go to the  Department of Army [U.S. Department of the Army] and talk about the fact that there are no African Americans in that school.
Speaker 1: Now was that '74 [1974] or '70--
Speaker 2: No, '72 [1972].
Speaker 1: Oh, say, that, that--
Speaker 2: Seventy-two [1972].
Speaker 1: --was in '72 [1972], okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in 1972.  So the said but you, and you probably are gonna have to do some work 'cause we are gonna recommend you as the person to go and find some students.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was on my way on vacation.  I said y'all do what you want.  I'm outta here (laughter), so I went on vacation.  And when I came back, the chief of the [U.S.] Army Nurse Corps came over, yeah, that's right.  And who would it be except for Lillian Dunlap--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --who was chief at the time.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And she said I have a job.  And I was upstairs in a curriculum meeting, you know, up there being bored with somebody's objection to something for the 958th time.  Anyway, faculty, you know, among faculty members you have personalities; you have some real characters.  (Laughter) And so, I was just learning to listen to them all and go on to the next thing.  But I was sitting there, and someone came in to pass a note, pass me a note and said General Dunlap would like to see you immediately.  I said God, what on earth is happening, 'cause I had not a clue, you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: No, so I went downstairs, and when I got down there she said come in here Clara Leach [HistoryMaker General Clara Adams-Ender].  And I, I say Clara Leach because she never acknowledged the fact that I got married--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --never even--didn't think I should have done it at the time and never even acknowledged.  So she said come in here Clara Leach.  I gotta talk to you, (laughter) so I went in.  And she said I've got a job to do, and I need your help because I can't go and do it.  And I said whatever it is, ma'am, I'll take care of it, because she sure had helped me out of a lot of binds.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And so she told me that this contingent had gone down to the Department of Army and told them that they, we needed to have more minorities in the school at Walter Reed and that they needed to be in there by the fall or else there would be some, some demonstrations--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --out there at Walter Reed.  And so she said I need to, for you to go out and find ten black students by this fall.  Well, now we're talking about the middle of summer.  Any student who leaves school in May and doesn't know how they're gonna pay their way back the next September is in trouble, you see.  So, I, I thought that was gonna be kind of tough, but I didn't say a word to her.  I said, "Yes, ma'am, I can handle that."
Story_ID: 322261
Speaker 1: So I went. She [Lillian Dunlap] got me and she had Hazel Johnson-Brown, who was the first African American to be general.  She made general later.  But she got me to--and Hazel and Maggie Bailey [Margaret E. Bailey], who we just took her out to her ninetieth birthday, she was their first female African American in, in the [U.S.] Army to make full colonel, and to make lieutenant colonel and then to make full colonel.  And so she were the, we were the three people.  Maggie had been retired, but she brought Maggie back on active duty, and Maggie and I went out to try to recruit these students.  Well, the [U.S.] Army Nurse Corps has a tremendous network among nurses around the country because many folks have served, many of them to retirement.  But some of them only served three or four years, and they now teach in schools of nursing and/or they work in hospitals and in, influential positions in the profession.  So they found out we had difficulty.  And there was this one woman that was out in, at working at, in Detroit [Michigan] at Wayne State University.  And she said listen, we have more students here than we can take because priority in, in getting money in way, in Detroit--I mean in Michigan--goes to the university [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan], Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan], and Wayne State, in that order.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So, so they said you come out here and you should be able to find some students.  Well, I went out there, and I found eight students--
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: --eight students.  And then I had to deal with the rules of the [U.S.] military.  Matter of fact, I probably found about eighteen, but I had to deal with some of the rules of the military.  One rule that they had at that time was that you could not be on active duty as a female and have family members--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --you see.  So this one woman had a baby.  This kid had a smart, had a great record.  I mean, I mean she said I'll do whatever's necessary.  She said I'll, I'll sign over the guardianship.  I'll do whatever.  Wouldn't take her, wouldn't take her.  Two years later they would've taken her, but they didn't want to take that year.  So then there were a number of folks who had, who were kind of heavy.  This one nurse was kind of heavy, and she said well, I really want to go.  I said well, you've gotta lose three pounds.  She said well, what can I do?  I said you gotta lose three pounds this weekend.  She said--I said go home and don't drink anything but water, and don't eat anything but lettuce leaves (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I mean I had all sorts of things fixed up for them.  God is great.  We went out there, and we found those students that, that, that we needed.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And then there were a couple of, of students in the local schools.  One was at Howard University [Washington, D.C.], and the dean never forgave me for taking out her student, but I brought her on active duty.  She went on to be a full colonel and served the Army well.  She, that, that kid had marvelous time, and, and she turned out.  I was so proud of her.  And then we--there was another woman that was a private.  She was in the operating room at Walter Reed [Walter Reed Army Medical Center; Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland].  And someone called and said oh, listen, she really would love to go into the Army, she said.  So I went over, interviewed her, and talked to her.  She came from Yazoo, Mississippi [Yazoo City, Mississippi].
Speaker 2: Good old Yazoo.
Speaker 1: And I said (laughter), and I said--but she couldn't go in the class [at Walter Reed Army Institute of Nursing, Washington, D.C.] that year.  She had to go in the class the following year because she had to go and finish up a couple of courses before she--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --could come in.  So I put her in the class the following 'cause I was trying to make sure that we got the classes all filled, you know, even though I had to bring these in very quickly.  We were supposed to have the students there by the end of August, and we didn't make it--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --but because of a number of things that was going on, and it's, and it's really very interesting.  There are a number of challenges, they're going around.  And sometimes people just stand in the door 'cause they can stand in the door (laughter), you know.  And I had learned how to go to Lil Dunlap [Lillian Dunlap] when I had troubles years before.  And I had this one colonel that was giving me a tough time over in the Army Nurse Corps branch.  Now she knew we had to get these students in, but she was vowed and determined that we were gonna use the old rules.  Well, you can't use the old rules when you need people (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: When you need people you gotta get the rules to fit the folks to deal with what you gotta deal with.  She wasn't understanding any of that.  So I finally went to Lil, and I said, "Lil, I'm having trouble over here, and here is my problem, General."  And so she said, "No, no, no, no, you will not have that problem."  She said, "I'll take care of that."  And she took care of that, and that eased the whole thing in, and then I was able to get those students in--
Story_ID: 322262
Speaker 1: But I can tell you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So for that first year, how many of the students, how many students did you have, and how many were African American?
Speaker 1: For that we had two hundred and two hundred plus students in the program [at Walter Reed Army Institute of Nursing, Washington, D.C.], and eight of them--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --were African American.
Speaker 2: Okay, very good.
Speaker 1: No, no, no, no, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  I brought in the ten.  We got the ten there, and then there was one that was admitted through the regular group, so we had eleven--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --yeah.  And the--we brought the students in from Detroit [Michigan], got 'em all in the classes and that type of thing, and, and two of them could not stay.  They were homesick; they could not stay out here.  They just, you know, they said Washington [D.C.] is fine.  We, we like the school, and we like everything here, but we miss Detroit.  And so, back home they went.  But the other stayed, and I will tell you it is interesting because three of those students out of that class are physicians today.
Speaker 2: Wonderful.
Speaker 1: Anesthesiology.  One has got to the emergency room up in New York someplace, and the other one is an internist.  So, three of 'em went on to medical school after they were done.  I think two or three of them stayed for a twenty-year career in the, in the [U.S.] military, or beyond, made full colonel, and of course, they're retired and did real well through that.  And so, I was quite pleased, you see, with what--that was probably my greatest contribution.  Lil [Lillian Dunlap] said to me, she said if you go out and do this job for me, I'll make it worth your while.  And so I said yes ma'am.  I went ahead and didn't even know what that meant, didn't even care, just wanted to do what she wanted me to do, so I went and did that.  And that particular year she tried to get me on the list for promote, below the zone to lieutenant colonel.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, but I couldn't get on--well, actually, I did make the list, but they were short of money that year, so they cut anybody who was below the zone.  And so I got cut out that year--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --but I made it the next year (laughter).
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Next year, on the list.  I'll be tacked onto somebody else's list again.  And so that worked out very, very well.
Story_ID: 323393
Speaker 1: You are doing great things (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right, recruiting nurses.
Speaker 1: And all of a sudden that big day comes up.  You're in for lieutenant colonel.
Speaker 2: That's right, yes, indeed.
Speaker 1: Okay, tell us what had you done?  Who was clearing the way for you?
Speaker 2: Let me tell you, Lil Dunlap [Lillian Dunlap] cleared the way.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I mean she just made sure that that happened, and, and that, that was making that recruiting worth my while because that was a challenging time for me--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --during that period.  And I, I tried to always learn something for all those situations.  And, and of course, you know, I'm getting to travel, and that's all right with me.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know, I like this a lot.  But this--are you familiar with Detroit [Michigan] at all?
Speaker 1: A little, yes.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, they had, they have Grand Boulevard.
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: It runs (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Yep (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, we were at that Holiday Inn on Grand Boulevard [sic.] in Detroit, and that's where we set up shop.  They set us up down there, and we had the students to come to us and do all the things.  So, that was, that was a great time.  That was a great time, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and Maggie [Margaret E. Bailey] was from Detroit.  See, she had moved up from Alabama.  She went to school in Alabama, and she had, she was the nurse that was the first one to become a colonel, an active duty colonel, as an African American.  And she had retired.  She'd been with the Peace Corps, and she'd retired from the [U.S.] Army.  But she had, her folks still lived in Detroit.  She had a brother and sister that lived there, and so that was great for us because we could go out and do the things we needed to do, and then in the evening we could go out and hang out at their house and, and, and have a little bit of hometown stuff there.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was, that was great, yep.  And then I went, when I finally came back to, to teaching because I--
Speaker 1: No, I don't want you to go pass that, that promotion.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: You got the--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --you got the promotion.
Speaker 2: No, no, I got on the list, yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, you got on the list--
Speaker 2: --yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: --in '75 [1975].
Speaker 2: Yeah, I didn't get on the, I didn't get--no, I got on the list in '74 [1974], and I got promoted in '75 [1975].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But I had, I had left, I had left the school at that time.
Speaker 1: Oh, oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, then, then we're, we're, we're going too, too, too fast.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 1: Let's go back to '74 [1974].
Speaker 2: Yeah '74 [1974], whenever--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --I got picked up on the list.
Speaker 1: Right, you got picked up on--
Speaker 2: Oh, Lord--
Speaker 1: --on, on, on the list.
Speaker 2: --oh.
Speaker 1: But that year you left the Walter Reed school of nursing [Walter Reed Army Institute of Nursing, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: That's right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: But I also--
Speaker 1: --why did you leave?
Speaker 2: --had surgery.
Speaker 1: How did that--
Speaker 2: I had a surgery that year--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --major surgery that year, and I got divorced that year.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I, I left because I'd been there five years.
Story_ID: 323394
Speaker 1: Yeah, and Lil Dunlap [Lillian Dunlap] said, "It's time for you to go do something else (laughter)."
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I said all right; I'm going.  So she said, "It's time for you to go be an assistant chief nurse."  So I said, "But I don't want to go be an assistant chief nurse.  I wanna go to law school."
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So she said, "Clara [HistoryMaker General Clara Adams-Ender], I'm not making lawyers here, remember.  I'm in the nursing business (laughter)."
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: So she said, "I'll tell ya: I'll give you a couple of weeks to make up your mind as to what you wanna do."  So I said, "Well, if I don't make this move now, I may not get a chance to make this move."  And you know, the thing was, if I got out of the [U.S.] military at this time, I never would have been lieutenant colonel, you know.  And so I said but I gotta go check out this law school thing 'cause I always wanted to be a lawyer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so I was gonna go and do it.  I was going to and--
Speaker 2: So you were going to not follow your mentor's--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --advice.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And you were now determined (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Gonna go do my thing.
Speaker 2: --to go to law school.
Speaker 1: That's right: I was going to--
Speaker 2: Had you applied?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And any of the school accepted you?
Speaker 1: I went down to--I was accepted in San Antonio [Texas], St. Mary's [St. Mary's School of Law].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I was accepted there, yeah.  I--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and I was, I had looked into the school here at George Washington [George Washington University Law School, Washington, D.C.].  And I went down for an interview, and this fellow took my record, and he looked at my record.  And he was the dean of the law school.  And he said, "Major, I'm not taking you here."  He said, "What are you doing?"  He said, "You've got a brilliant career going on as an [U.S.] Army nurse."  He said, "Why you want to give that up and come over here?"  Ripped up my application right there in front of me, and he said if you--I'll tell you this.  He said, "I'll make a deal with you."  He said, "You go and do what the chief has asked you to do."  He said, "You go out there and you get"--'cause he'd been in the Army before, so he knew what it meant to be able to go to Command and General Staff College [Fort Leavenworth, Kansas], 'cause that was going to be the next place I was going.  And, and so he said, "You go and do what she says," he said, "and if it doesn't work out, I promise you you can come back here and go to school."  He said, "But otherwise, I'm not taking you. No, you got your--."
Speaker 2: You remember his name?
Speaker 1: I don't remember his name.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I don't remember--
Speaker 2: Go ahead
Speaker 1: --the dean.  So I said well that's out--
Speaker 2: Now was this before your major surgery or after?
Speaker 1: This was after.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This is after.
Speaker 2: So you'd had the--
Speaker 1: I'm getting ready to make a move now.
Speaker 2: --major surgery.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Okay, and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm getting ready to make a move now--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --'cause Lil said you got two weeks to decide.  And so I went back and I said I'm going to Fort Meade [Fort George G. Meade, Maryland] 'cause she wanted me to go to Fort Meade for a year--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --because I had to be in a holding pattern where she could get me out of there to get me to that school the next year.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 323395
Speaker 1: So, that's what she [Lillian Dunlap] did, and she sent me over to Fort Meade [Fort George G. Meade, Maryland].  And I went over there and I'll tell you, that's probably one of the better things ever happened to me in my life because I met a woman who knew nursing like nobody I'd ever met before, Katie Galloway [Katherine Galloway].  And she taught me what she knew, taught me a lot about the administration of nursing practice, and it was great; I had a marvelous time.  And she was at the point where she thought that she was not going to be able to do anything further.  She wasn't gonna get pro- promoted anymore as far as the [U.S.] military was concerned 'cause she was a senior lieutenant colonel at that time, but she made full colonel.  And not only did she make full colonel, but she got sent to Walter Reed [Walter Reed Army Medical Center; Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland] to be the chief nurse.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: And I couldn't think of anybody better to go and do that.  And she went over there to do that.  So, I stayed there with her for a year, and that's the year I got promoted.  I got promoted in the summer that year.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, the summer of 1975?
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I got promoted.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And following that ye- year at Walter Reed and, and the promotion, where, where were you assigned?
Speaker 1: Then I went to Fort Meade.  I went, went to Fort Meade after that, see.
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, okay--
Speaker 1: See, I went to Fort Meade in '75 [1975].
Speaker 2: You went to Fort Meade, okay--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --okay.  And, and--
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.  I went to Fort Meade in '74 [1974], the summer of '74 [1974].
Speaker 2: That's what, that's what I had, '70--
Speaker 1: That's right, '74 [1974]; that's right, '74 [1974].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And then I got promoted in '75 [1975].
Speaker 2: Then you got promoted in '75 [1975].
Speaker 1: That's right, and then I went--
Speaker 2: And where were assigned?
Speaker 1: --off to the Command and General Staff College [Fort Leavenworth, Kansas].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's the major course at Leavenworth, Kansas.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
Speaker 2: Staff College in Leavenworth, okay.
Speaker 1: That's right, and that was a year's assignment.
Speaker 2: Okay, and that was a year's assignment?
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I was the first African American nurse to attend that course.
Speaker 2: Okay, and you stayed there a year, so that--
Speaker 1: One year, right.
Speaker 2: --brings us up to--
Story_ID: 323396
Speaker 1: Any memorable experiences there [at Command and General Staff College, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas]?
Speaker 2: Well, this was another opportunity for me to go to school with and to learn more about the armor, artillery, and infantry, and the other branches of the [U.S.] Army, and how we all come together to be able to deal with fighting wars and, and, and defending the country.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and it was, it was a memorable experience.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'll tell you, the tactics almost did me in.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I had to, you know, sit up and, and think about, reasonably, about that situation.  And that, and I one day I said to myself: self, I said, how much do you really need to know about tactics in order to be able to do your job in the future?  And a still small voice said not much (laughter).  So I said okay; I'm gonna learn what I need, and then I'm going from here.
Speaker 1: Move on.
Speaker 2: But the thing I found out was that you could learn a lot more if you weren't a part of it, you know, 'cause you could sit there, and you, you just looking at the stuff pure and simple as it is.  And those guys that were, were there and, and thought they knew everything because they belonged to the branches didn't do as well.  I could do real good because see, I didn't have any preconceived ideas.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I didn't know really how it went.  All I knew is what the book told me (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --see.  And so we had lots of good exchanges and good arguments over there, one about Vietnam [Vietnam War] because this was--a teacher came one day and said tomorrow we are gonna talk about why we were in Vietnam.  Oh, well, most of the co- most of the students there belonged to the three major branches: the armor, artillery, or the infantry.  They said well, we don't have to study tonight.  I said well, I do, so I went home and got my books.  And I was reading all that stuff.  I said geez, there's no real reason how come we were in Vietnam.  I mean, everybody's got an opinion, but there's no real reasons here.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Now, I said what, maybe I'll learn something if I listen to those fellows tomorrow (laughter).  So, I got over there and the fellow and true the instructor, true to what he said, started talking about why we were in Vietnam.  This guy, who was my deputy, 'cause I was a class leader out there, and he was my deputy, and he said, and he was an infantrymen, so he said well, we were in Vietnam because we went there to deliver the people from the, the oppressors, from the--the guy says that, the artillery guy said is that why you were in Vietnam?  We weren't in Vietnam for that reason.  We were in Viet- (laughter) well, I think the fellow made his point because an hour later, we had no one reason how come we were in Vietnam (laughter).  And the conclusion was we didn't really know how come we were in Vietnam (laughter).
Speaker 1: Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 2: I don't think that ever quite got sorted out, but I learned a lot from dealing with the guys.  And I told, I told 'em--
Story_ID: 323397
Speaker 1: And there were some women there because, well, in my class [at Command and General Staff College, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas], this is, there were about 1150 students, eight women.
Speaker 2: Whoa.
Speaker 1: Eight women, and I'll tell you, it was very interesting.  And so, we'd get together and me and another lieutenant colonel was the senior woman there, and so we--1976 was the International Year of Women [International Women's Year], and so we put on a program for them.
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-six [1976].
Speaker 1: Seventy-six [1976], yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was bicentennial year, but it was also the International Year of Women, and so as a result of that, we thought we'd put on a little program.  Well, those guys are so male-oriented, you know, they were so male-oriented everything to me, until they never thought about the women that were there in it.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I said well, you know, we, we do have presence here (laughter).  So, I went to talk to the deputy commandant, and he said, "Well, you know, I'm not interested in any program."  He said, "If you want to put it on, he said we'll give you the place and the time."  Well, he gave us a great place.  He gave us the, the large auditorium.  We used to call it the big bedroom.  And, and the time he gave us though, was not so good.  The time he gave us was at 10:00 on a Mon- on a Tuesday after a four-day holiday weekend.
Speaker 2: Ten p.m.--
Speaker 1: No, ten in the morning.
Speaker 2: Ten a.m.
Speaker 1: Ten in the morning, yeah, because we started, we started classes usually at 7:30 in the morning.  So, these students not only had had a long weekend, but they also had two and a half hours off in the morning.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: Now, I'll tell you, if you wanna set somebody up to fail, you can't do any better than that.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But I was cool.  I said, "Listen, we're going to"--so we went around and basically we coerced our classmates.  We said, "Listen, if you don't come (laughter) to this program because we're gonna tell you something you need to know.  If you don't come to this program, you're gonna have troubles out here."  So we got about 700 out of the 1100 students--
Speaker 2: Very good.
Speaker 1: --which I thought was pretty good.
Speaker 2: Very good.
Speaker 1: I thought was pretty good.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Oh, but that all worked out fine, yeah.
Speaker 2: So that, that was a year there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was a year there.
Speaker 2: And so now we come out to 1977.
Speaker 1: No, 1976, middle of '76 [1976] I'm going, I--
Speaker 2: Oh, the middle of '76 [1976]--
Speaker 1: Yeah, see, see, I went to school from July until July, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So we're--that ended then in July of nine--
Speaker 1: Of seventy--'76 [1976].
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: Right, I was in the bicentennial class at Leavenworth [Fort Leavenworth, Leavenworth County, Kansas].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: Great school though, school that teaches the middle management for [U.S.] Army, Army officers.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 323398
Speaker 1: So July of 1976, where are you off to?
Speaker 2: Fort Sam Houston, Texas [Fort Sam Houston, San Antonio, Texas] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Fort Sam.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Down at Fort Sam and I was a--
Speaker 1: And what are you going to do that, what are you doing there?
Speaker 2: Inspecting hospitals.
Speaker 1: Are you--
Speaker 2: I was an inspector general.
Speaker 1: Inspector general.
Speaker 2: I was an IG, right.  I was in the IG's office.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was a nurse inspector general to hospitals.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, any memorable experiences in that position?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Lots of them, some which I will never tell (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But this was a, you know, I'm still over here doing what that, what that nurse told me back there in Korea.  She said if you open yourself up, you will get these assignments, and people will still put you in positions of increasing responsibility, and this was one.  I will tell you, I thought I'd come to the end of it, because my role was to ser- be one of two nurses that was on the inspector general's team that looked at the hospitals in the [U.S.] military to make sure that they met regulation standards.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: See, the all of our hospitals in the military, along with the ones on the outside, are inspected by the Joint Commission on the accreditation, for the accreditation of healthcare organizations [Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations; The Joint Commission]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --they are at this time.  At that time, they were the JCH [sic. JCAHO].  And they inspect all the hospitals to make sure that they meet the standards as far as the United States is concerned.  But the military still has standards of its own that it requires by regulation in the hospital.  And so we had to do that and work with the Joint Commission to make sure that it all worked out.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that, that's what I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: What an assignment, ah.
Speaker 1: Inspector general.
Speaker 2: Because, oh, yeah, an IG, you know, and you know everybody loves the IG.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) They don't.
Speaker 1: Well, when I, when I said, when I said--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --right, they, they love to avoid him.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: That's right, and you know, really, truly, people don't understand what they do, but that's exactly what they do.  If you say I'm an IG, oh, no, everybody else goes to the other side of the room.  I mean this one guy said.  He was in my class, and he said he could clean out a whole bar on Friday night.  Just go, I'm gonna say I'm the IG.  They said oh no, and nobody want to talk to me.  So (laughter), I spent a lot of time dealing with people that was way from where I was, you see, because we were, we were two nurse IG folks.  But she worked on one team, and I worked on the other team, so I seldom saw her, you know.  And then on the weekends when I got back, the people who were other places on the base there at, at Fort Sam Houston were doing other things.  And so I didn't get a chance.  So, I learned a lot about how to entertain myself (laughter), and I learned how to do picture-framing and all this, this thing.  This woman had a shop, and so she taught me; she and her husband taught me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we had a great time.
Speaker 1: How long were, were you with the inspector general's office [Office of the Inspector General]?
Speaker 2: Two years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --two years.
Speaker 1: --so that brings us up to what?  Nineteen seventy-eight [1978].
Speaker 2: That's right--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --nineteen seventy-eight [1978].
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-eight [1978].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 323399
Speaker 1: Where is your next assignment?
Speaker 2: My next assignment (laughter) was as an assistant chief nurse in, at the Frankfurt Army Regional Medical Center in Frankfurt, Germany (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Now I just thought this was the most terrible time for me to go out of the country.  I just knew that I did not need to be going out of the country at that time.  So before I left (laughter), I went by the, the assignment office in Washington [D.C.] and met my good friend, Pat Miller.  And I said Pat Miller, I--'cause I had taught with her.  We, we were at--she was an administrator over at, at WRAIN [Walter Reed Army Institute of Nursing, Washington, D.C.], and I taught with her while I was teaching.  And then I was an administrator because I got to be the education coordinator of the school after I had recruited those students.  And so I worked with her awhile then, so I knew her very well.  So I went to Washington, and I said Pat Miller, I am going out of the country.  I said but I don't want you to forget that it is my year to be promoted (laughter).  I was a rather cocky person sometimes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so she said--
Speaker 1: So you're saying 1978 was a year for you to--
Speaker 2: To be promoted.
Speaker 1: To be promoted.
Speaker 2: I knew just that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --was she--I was supposed--I said so whenever the board sets this year, and the list comes out, remember the name is Adams [HistoryMaker General Clara Adams-Ender].  Here's how it's spelled.  She said get outta here (laughter).  So I went out, and I went on to, in July, I went on to Germany.
Speaker 1: Okay, before we visit you there in Germany, I wanna just sort of get a short stat notice, status notice on, on the family.  Your mother's [Caretha Sapp Leach]--
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: --your mother's still doing well?
Speaker 2: Nineteen--yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I miss my father [Otha Leach].
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-eight [1978].
Speaker 2: My father died in 1976, when I was in--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --med school, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, let me--
Speaker 2: Dad died, yeah.
Speaker 1: Let's, let's go there.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, that year at Fort Meade [Fort George G. Meade, Maryland] was a memorable year because he got sick with cancer of the prostate--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and really refused surgery for a very long time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and I even went down and talked to him, and, and he wouldn't have anything to do with it at that point.  He said, "You need to understand that I believe that God will take care of me."  And I said, "I believe that, dad.  I don't have any problems with that.  But sometimes you gotta give God a little bit of help (laughter)."  So, he and I talked about that, and then he finally decided he was gonna have surgery 'cause he was in so much pain.  So, he went and had the surgery, but by the time he got the surgery, he had had a spread to the brain.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so--
Speaker 1: It was too late.
Speaker 2: --he died, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so he had, they gave him some treatment and that type of thing, and he lived for about a year after that.  And no, he didn't live but about seven months after that, and he died in April of '76 [1976].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, any other things happening to either your sisters or your brothers during that period.
Speaker 2: Ray [Raymond Leach] retired in '75 [1975]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and went home.  And so he and, and I still tell him about it until today: I will be forever grateful to him because when my parents got sick, then he was there, you see.  And he could always tell me if I needed to come or if something was happening or what was going on at the time because he could look the situation over very well, and he went to see them very often.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so that helped me.
Speaker 1: Now did your mother get sick while you were over in Germany, Frankfurt?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother had had arthritis since she was forty years old.  And so she, she was, even though she'd get to the point where it'd get crippling, or they would try to deal with her with certain medications, and she'd have little episodes, but most of the time she was just chronically ill all of the time.  And she maintained herself very well, yeah, during that period (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 323400
Speaker 1: So you're going over to Frankfurt [Germany].
Speaker 2: I'm going to Frankfurt.
Speaker 1: You arrive in Frankfurt as the assistant chief nurse there, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I did, for the medical center [Frankfurt Army Regional Medical Center, Frankfurt, Germany].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you're still a lieutenant colonel.
Speaker 2: I'm still a lieutenant colonel.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell us about your memorable events there at Frankfurt.
Speaker 2: Well, first was, I was the assistant chief nurse.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and that was a good position because it was the largest staff that I'd had to deal with before.  And the chief nurse was retiring, and so she said listen, you can start to learn how to be a chief nurse now, she said, because I am getting ready to retire, and I'll let you do many of the things here.  So she gave me a lot of leeway to do a number of things.  And so, I had an opportunity to work a lot with the, the nurses and, and directly with them because I was their--I was the supervisor for many of, many of them directly.  And then for the others, they supervised people, and, and I had to, to manage in the manner in which they did that and that type of thing.  It was a very good experience for me, I'll tell ya, a major experience for me in my, in my learning.  And I'm still moving up the ladder and doing various jobs and so forth.
Story_ID: 323401
Speaker 1: I got there [Frankfurt Army Regional Medical Center, Frankfurt, Germany] in July.  And then in December--was it December?  November, no, no, no, no, no, it was November.  I was sitting at my office, in my office one evening late trying to finish up some things when it's quiet and still.  And I got a call from the adjutant of the, of the hospital, and he said, he said, "Hey, ma'am, he said this is Captain Armstrong [ph.]."  He said, "I'm just checking out something."  He said, "Are you Clara L. Adams [HistoryMaker General Clara Adams-Ender]?"  And I said, "Yes."  And he said, "Is your social security number--" and he gave me the social security--I gave him--he gave me the number.  And I said, "Yes, that's my number."  I said, "John, why you asking me all these questions?"  He said, "I wanna tell you congratulations; you're on the list for promotion to colonel."
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: I said yes (laughter).
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: So Pat Miller [ph.] paid attention.  She didn't have anything to do with it, but (laughter), but I made the list for full colonel below the zone.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now this is my seventeenth year.
Speaker 2: On the list for full colonel?
Speaker 1: Full colonel.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Full colonel in seventeen years.  I tell you, I was humming.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So I said this is wonderful (laughter).  Well, I had met this guy back in, after I got there, this German [Heinz Ender].  He was an oral surgeon and orthodontist.  And he told me shortly after I met him that, that I was going to be a full colonel.  He said you're gonna make that.  He said you're gonna make colonel.  He said you're gonna make colonel this year.  I don't know how he knew that, but I met him through the German-American health professional society we had there.  It was called the Towners Medical Society [ph.].  And we got together as healthcare professionals, both Germans and Americans, and we talked about the issues of the profession, professions that we were in.  And he was an oral surgeon, orthodontists, and so he came to the meetings.  And my chief nurse, she encouraged me to go because I, I was just certain that nothing exciting was ever gonna happen to me again in my life since I had gotten to be an assistant chief nurse.  And when we were lieutenants we used to always talk about the little old ladies up front (laughter), you know.  Well, I'd become a little old lady up front.  And so I said well, so I literally left the country with my bed and my books.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I was gonna read through that whole assignment.  Well, needless to say, the bed got used, but the books didn't (laughter).  But I met him there, and he told me I was gonna be a lieutenant colonel and--I mean that I was gonna be a full colonel before that year was out.  He said as matter of fact, he said you know, you're probably gonna make general before you're done with this.  How prophetic, but I didn't know anything at that time.  So I was so happy to be on that list, um-hm.  I'll tell you that was great.  And the next summer was, that was the end of '78 [1978].  The next summer I made full colonel.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So in the summer of 1979 you made--
Speaker 1: I was full colonel.  August of '79 [1979]--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --I was a full colonel, eighteen years on active duty.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now it would take me another eight years to get to be a general, you understand (laughter), but--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --but I made it.  That was, that was probably one of the happiest times of mine because I knew full well I was never gonna be a lieutenant again (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, right, right.
Story_ID: 323402
Speaker 1: So in 1979 in August (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And--yes.
Speaker 1: --you're promoted to full colonel.
Speaker 2: Full colonel, that's right.
Speaker 1: How did--
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: --how did that change your life?
Speaker 2: Well, it changed my life in the first way that it changed my assignment immediately.  I was, had been friends and colleagues with a nurse that was at that time assigned down at the Health Services Command [U.S. Army Health Services Command].  And she was assigned in the nursing science branch.  And so, someone called her up and said, "Hey, listen, Clara Adams [HistoryMaker General Clara Adams-Ender] made full colonel at, in Frankfurt [Germany].  Do you think we ought to leave her there to be the chief nurse at that hospital [Frankfurt Army Regional Medical Center, Frankfurt, Germany]?"  And see, be, and the reason why they were asking was because that time, only senior full colonels got to be chief nurses at the medical centers.  And I'm told that Ms. Mar- that Colonel Marge Wilson said, "If the [U.S.] Army is crazy enough to make Clara Adams a colonel, let them eagles fly over Frankfurt (laughter)."  So they left me there to be--
Speaker 1: They left--
Speaker 2: --chief nurse.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Left me there to be the chief nurse.  And I will tell you, that was a marvelous assignment.  I mean I never worked so hard in my life, but the Army at this time, the [U.S.] Army Nurse Corps, had decided that we had waited around for the practice of nursing to put together standards, and they had never done it.  And we were going to implement standards of nursing practice throughout the Army.
Speaker 1: Great.
Speaker 2: And so we set out to do that.  And we set out with, with the chief.  And at that time, Hazel Johnson-Brown had become the chief, and my good friend Lil Dunlap [Lillian Dunlap] had retired.  And I--and whenever she set out to do that, we then said that we'd do our part in Frankfurt.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I, you know, there was no time though to get these things done and to get them organized on regular duty time, so I had to bring the people in on Saturday.  Well, I brought 'em in one Saturday, and I had set out some questions and so forth.  And along with the education department, we'd gotten together information to get things done.  I gotta stop?
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: No, not in the middle.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And so I'd set out to get a number (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Just wa--
Speaker 2: --of things done.  And as a result of that, we set out to talk about what is the profession of nursing all about.
Story_ID: 323403
Speaker 1: Now your new assignment, chief nurse.
Speaker 2: Chief nurse.
Speaker 1: Frankfurt [Germany].
Speaker 2: Yes, in Frankfurt.
Speaker 1: You were very, very happy over that, and you also, your promotion, of course, to full colonel.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you had a big bash.
Speaker 2: Had a big bash--
Speaker 1: Okay, give us a--
Speaker 2: --I mean a big bash.
Speaker 1: --give us a taste of it.
Speaker 2: Well, I had, as I said, I'd met this German.  His name was Heinz [Heinz Ender].  And he, he and I went out to meet some friends.  I had some friends that were in San Antonio [Texas] who had been assigned in Frankfurt be, before.  And they call--they sent a letter to their friends there in, in, near Germany, near Frankfurt, in Busbach [Stolberg, Germany], a place called Busbach.  And they told them to, to have me come out and see them.  So the daughter spoke a little English, so she called.  So when she called, Heinz went to, to talk with her on the telephone, and then he allowed her to speak her language, you know, German.  And so they arranged--we arranged to go and visit them.  So we went out to visit them, and we got to be real good friends because when we got out there we found that they came, her parents, this young woman's parents came from the same place that Heinz did, in East Germany.  And so, as a result of that, they all knew the same (laughter), the same kinds of things to do, same customs and all that business.  And the father was a baker, and the mother worked at one of the local boys homes, is where she was working I think at that time.  But she had worked in the club at, out there at Busbach at one point in time, and then she decided she didn't want to do that anymore.  So she moved on to something else, but that's where she had gotten started.  And so she'd worked with the Americans, so they all spoke English, you know, fairly well.  So, we went out to see them.  Well, he was a baker, and when it came time for my promotion, Heinz said you know, we should get Helmut [ph.] to cater your promotion.  So we went out here and we asked him if he would do that, because you know, he'd bake the cakes and do, and she'd do the other things that were, were necessary, do the, the canapes and all of those things.  And so he said, "I will."  He said, "And I will do it free, for nothing, if you have a general there."  So I said oh, I gotta work this out.  I didn't know any generals at that time (laughter), not that were assigned in Europe.  Well, I was up on the, the, in the hospital [Frankfurt Army Regional Medical Center, Frankfurt, Germany] one day, up on one of the units, and I said to, I was talking to one of the young troops there that, one of these young troops that I used to, like that, like the ones I used to teach down at Fort Sam Houston [San Antonio, Texas], one of the medics.  And he said, "Ma'am, he said there's a general that's up on the unit here."  He said, "His name is General Rogers [Charles Calvin Rogers]."  He said, "Do you know him?"  I said, "No, I don't know him."  He said, "You need to go and see him," so I said, "Okay."  I said, "I'll wander by."  He said, "No, ma'am, you need to go and see him."  So I said, "Oh, okay."  (Laughter) So, so I left that unit and did a couple of rounds in that portion of the hospital.  And then I went over to where he said the general was, and I got over there and I met General Rogers.  And General Rogers was a two-star general that was assigned there in Frankfurt in the, in the corps headquarters.  And he was an African American, and I didn't know any of this at the time.  But he was an African American, and I said to him, "Sir, I'm happy to meet you," and I went over to meet him.  I told him, I said, "Now listen, I'm gonna be a full colonel (laughter).  And we're having a party, and I'm wondering if you would come."  I said, "I'm gonna tell you, you are guest of honor for a reason."  And he said, "How come?"  I said, "Because these Germans told me that they'll cater my party for nothing if you will--if I could get a general to the party."  He said, "I'm on" (laughter).  His wife was German at that time.  And so he said I'll come, and so he came, and they were absolutely delighted because he was a gracious man.  He was, as a matter fact, over and above being a, a general and in that corps over there, he was a marvelous human being.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, as a matter of fact, when he retired from the [U.S.] military he studied the ministry, yeah.  He died a few years ago, but--'cause he had cancer of the prostate too--but he had gotten a Medal of Honor when he was in--Charlie Rogers.  I don't know if you ever heard of him, but he got a Medal of Honor when he was in Vietnam as a lieutenant colonel.  He got--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --got a Medal of Honor.  And so, but the, the most kindest, humblest man I have ever met.  He was really quite nice.  But he said I'm coming to that party.  And so (laughter), so he came to that party, and we had a great time.  Oh goodness, let me tell you, eighty-four people, they--
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: --they did the, the, the hors d'oeuvres.  They brought everything.  They did ice carvings.  They did a marvelous job at that party.  We had a great time.  So (laughter), so that was my big bash for, for colonel--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because I thought maybe this is my last bash, so I'm gonna do it up right this time.  So we did it up right and had a marvelous time.
Story_ID: 323404
Speaker 1: Now as chief nurse, you were assigned with providing the standards now--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --'cause the [U.S.] Army--
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: --wanted new standards.
Speaker 2: --we were doing that, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We were going through the standards of nursing practice.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I was in the whole business of making sure that we got them all established there at Frankfurt [Frankfurt Army Regional Medical Center, Frankfurt, Germany] because I had to report out to the chief--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know that these were done.  And you know, we had a sister [Hazel Johnson-Brown] over there for the first time, and I wanted to make sure that she looked good.  And if I was gonna, could help her in any way, I was gonna make sure that I did that, you know.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: So I got the nurses together, and I said you know, we need to come together to get these standards done.  But there are some few things that we've got to agree on.  And one of the first things we got to agree on is what is nursing.  Well, that was just as bad as that argument about why we were in Vietnam (laughter).  Eight hours later we still hadn't come to any conclusions.  So I said now listen, let me tell you, now hear this: I have incorporated all of what you all have to say in there.  Let's see how this fits.  And so I gave them something to start to work from.  And then they, they said well, this is not too bad coming from the chief, but we'll fix it.  So they fixed it all up, and we started with the, what nursing was about we believed in our philosophy, did the values, did the vision, and got the standards to follow, 'cause you gotta have all that before you can put the standards down there.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I mean the chief sent me the standards, but she can't tell me what the value, the vision, and the, and the mission is for my facility, 'cause I gotta tell her that, you know, when I report out.  We got all that done, had a marvelous time doing that and then started implementing those standards.  I will tell you, it was a, an exciting time for Army nursing, and it was an exciting time for us, and especially for me because, you know, I never thought I could get folks together to hum like that, you see.  But I said geez, I must do pretty good at this kind of stuff.  I think I'll stay in this.  So, (laughter) that was my first assignment as a chief nurse and being in charge of a, an area.  And I had a boss who was a different kind of person, but we got along, you know.  And the other, other real memorable thing that happened to me there was that I got an opportunity to represent the United States Forces Europe that year at the 100 Mile March [International Four Day Marches] in Nijmegen, Holland, yeah.  And we walked.  I was a senior marcher.  And I took seven hundred troops up to do that march, and we had a great time.  But I'll tell you, we walked twenty-five miles a day and for four days.  It was an interesting time.  But I had the responsibility as a senior marcher to deal with all of the, the festivities that went on.  And Europeans do a lot of festivities.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and so I had to, to go and do those things and to represent the United States at the parties.
Story_ID: 323405
Speaker 1: Now there was something else coming up there on the horizon: Heinz [Heinz Ender].
Speaker 2: Yes, Heinz (laughter).  Heinz is on the--
Speaker 1: Let's--
Speaker 2: --horizon.
Speaker 1: --let's, let's, let's go--
Speaker 2: Let's bring Heinz up to date (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well, I, I started dating Heinz because he said, "You know, you seem like a very nice person, and I would like to show you Europe in style."  And I just had, my first thought was that old song that says, "If you got the money, honey, I got the time."  'Cause I really didn't have anything else to do at that time, and so I said well, I wouldn't mind seeing Europe with you, so.  He had houses, and he had a house in Austria, had a house in Switzerland, and a house in Italy at that time.  We still have the one in Italy, but at that time he had those houses.  And we had a good time visiting from place to place, just going to places.  And I was getting an opportunity to see various things and to see other countries.  We'd sometimes do four countries in one day.  Yeah, 'cause you can do that in Europe, you see without any trouble.  It was marvelous, yeah.  But I never got him to go to Paris [France], and he never went to Paris.  I have my reasons how come I think that's the case these days, but he never went there.  But we started dating, and I kind of kept it rather quiet because the, you know, you can't hang out where your troops hang out whenever you're doing these, doing these social things, because, you know, people always have different kinds of ideas about what it is you ought to be about and what's going on.  And so he said, "Listen, you can't hang around in this area, and I won't be seen with you around in this area."  He said, "We'll have to find someplace to go," and so we did.  He had an interest in some hotels down in Bavaria [Germany], and so we'd go to Bavaria, which was where Americans did not go very often.  And so we had an opportunity to go down there and, and see that area and, and do volksmarching and, and do all kinds of activities in that place, buy silver, crystal, and, and, and porcelain, had a marvelous time, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, see, because I mentioned that and my being able to buy something 'cause it's the first time I'm able to buy too very much of anything because I'd been sending kids to college--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --since I was a lieutenant (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you see.  And I finally got four of them [Adams-Ender's siblings] through--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --or, or as far as they would go.  I got two of them completely through and two who went as far as they would go, and then, that I was able then to have a little money to do some things for myself.
Story_ID: 323406
Speaker 1: Now let's name them kids, and then I want to get back to Heinz [Heinz Ender].  But the two that finished college, what--
Speaker 2: Were Rosa [Rosa Leach] and Doretha [Doretha Leach].
Speaker 1: And what were their majors?
Speaker 2: Rosa was in math, and Doretha was a, in nutrition.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so she was a dietician, yeah.
Speaker 1: And Rosa in, in math--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --was she teaching now?
Speaker 2: Yes, she's teaching now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she reminded me not too long ago her first job was in Danville, Virginia (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your other sister, she's, she, is she retired now, or, or is she--
Speaker 2: Bettie [Bettie Leach], Bettie, the--
Speaker 1: Bettie.
Speaker 2: --oldest one?  Yeah, she's retired now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and she's back down in North Carolina.  She just moved down there from New Jersey--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And the two that did not complete?
Speaker 2: One was Mary [Mary Leach], and she got married.  And so she went to work at Duke [Duke University, Durham, North Carolina], and she still works at Duke 'til today, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she works as a, she's one of those--what is it?  When she started, she was a data processing person, but now they do the computers and all of that stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So they take care of the management of units and that type of thing, unit--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --managing and that kind of--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the other was James [James Leach], and he's my brother that's in business for himself now down in--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --down in North Carolina.  Yeah, he went--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --he went to college for a couple of years too.
Speaker 1: And Ray [Raymond Leach] had come when he was in the--James has ALS [amyotrophic lateral sclerosis], is that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's the one--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --who has ALS--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 323407
Speaker 1: Let's go back to Heinz [Heinz Ender] now because--
Speaker 2: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: --we don't want to lose--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --lose that progression.
Speaker 2: Well, we're just wandering around.
Speaker 1: And so you, you two are wandering around--
Speaker 2: 'Round and--
Speaker 1: --and having fun--
Speaker 2: --seeing Europe and en--
Speaker 1: --and enjoying yourself--
Speaker 2: Yes, indeed.
Speaker 1: --and so forth and so on.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I was getting to see a lot of places and meeting a lot of people and learning a lot of languages because, you know, you got to do that in Europe because Europe is very close together, and you have to speak the language.  It's different in terms of the country that you're going to, yeah, so.
Speaker 1: Right.  And your feelings started deepening for Heinz during that period?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: One could say that, yes, indeed (laughter).
Speaker 1: And lead--
Speaker 2: He was a very nice man.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He really was a very nice fellow, yeah.
Speaker 1: And leading up to a proposal.
Speaker 2: Yes, which came.
Speaker 1: Which came.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: In my third year.  That was in 1980.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: No, 1981.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Eighty-one [1981] yeah, because I was coming home later that year.  And he said, "You know, if you're going home we need to consider that we need, may need to get married."  And I said--he said, "But I heard you say that you would never get married again."  He said, "So maybe we could just go to America, and we could live together."  I said, "Are you crazy?  The [U.S.] Army's gonna not look favorably upon its colonels living together, no, no, no, no."  So he said, "Well, then maybe we ought to think about getting married?"  I said, "Give me overnight to think about it."  The real deal was I needed to call my mother [Caretha Sapp Leach].  Because after my father [Otha Leach] died, my mother and I had become very close to one another.  And even though I was in, I was not, you know, physically in contact with her all of the time, I called her, about every day, and I talked to her from wherever I was, you know.  And so I used to call from Frankfurt [Germany], you know, and talk to her various times.  And so that's really what I've got to think about this overnight meant, is I gotta get to call mother (laughter).  So I went and called my mother, and she said--well, she had met him by that time 'cause she came over after I was promoted [to full colonel].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she had met him by that time, and he, he'd been here; he'd also been to America once.  And so she said yeah, she said he's a very nice man, she said, and I think you ought to consider it.  So I said okay; so I considered it, and I finally said yes.
Speaker 1: The next day?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: A, a few days later?
Speaker 2: Yeah, a few days later, yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Took me some time to get that reconciled in my head.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I did.
Speaker 1: And you two were married, date?
Speaker 2: June 22nd, 1981.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you were still assigned there in Frankfurt?
Speaker 2: Nope, nope, I'd gone.
Speaker 1: Oh, let me go back.
Speaker 2: I left Europe.  I left Europe in, in May of '81 [1981].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So a month, a month before you, you got married--
Speaker 2: I didn't get married in June.  I got married in July.  Why am I saying June?  July 22nd.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now--
Speaker 2: --shoot, I can tell you what it--
Speaker 1: --in May of '81 [1981]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you left.
Speaker 2: I left--
Speaker 1: Frankfurt.
Speaker 2: --Frankfurt, yeah, and left Heinz there, because you see, he had a practice.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And he said, "I'm gonna sell my practice."
Story_ID: 323408
Speaker 1: Where were you assigned?
Speaker 2: When I--
Speaker 1: Left there [Frankfurt, Germany]--
Speaker 2: I went to the United States Army Recruiting Command.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You remember that earlier assignment where I was supposed to have gone into recruiting?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And didn't want to go (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I still didn't want to go.  But, the chief came over, who was Hazel Johnson-Brown at that time, and she said, "I need for you to go to recruiting."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I said, just like I told Lil Dunlap [Lillian Dunlap] earlier: I'll--chief, I'll go wherever you want me to go. She said, "Well, we haven't been making the mission out there, and we need to make sure that we get the nurses in that we need." I said you got it; I can go do it.  And so I came on home.  And I was also in the War College [United States Army War College, Carlisle, Pennsylvania] by correspondence, so I had to go and do two weeks up at the War College in June.  And I did that, and then I drove my car on out to, to--
Speaker 1: Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: No, to the North Shore of Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Oh, North Shore.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Fort Sheridan, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Marvelous place.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so how, how long did you spend at the War College now?  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: I just did the two weeks in the summer.
Speaker 1: Two, two, two weeks--
Speaker 2: See, because I was--
Speaker 1: --in the summer.
Speaker 2: --in the course by correspondence.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I took it all year, and then we'd get together two weeks in the summer every year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was a tough way to do it, too (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, that same summer, in July and--
Speaker 2: Right.  I got married.
Speaker 1: You and Heinz [Heinz Ender] get married.
Speaker 2: Right--
Speaker 1: Did you get married in the states?
Speaker 2: --in Waukegan, Illinois.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Good old Waukegan.
Speaker 2: Good old Waukegan (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, and he still had his practice now, back in Germany.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: So after you got married (laughter)--
Speaker 2: He went back.  After we got married he went back over and sold his practice.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and--
Speaker 1: And, and in the meantime, you were a U.S. Army Recruiting Command.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay, then he came--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --back and you guys lived in, in Chicago, basically.
Speaker 2: Yes, and around the world, because you see, recruiting is three-quarters of the time travel (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Traveling.
Speaker 2: And so I was on the road an awful lot.  And it was interesting because Heinz came over and he saw all these things I had to do.  And one day he said listen, when I came over he said, "We have to talk."  He said, "Let's sit down," so I sat down and we talked.  He said, "You have a lot of work to do here," he said, "and I would like to help you."  He said, "But you must understand that if you ever are lucky enough to get to call yourself doctor in Germany, you don't ever do any more of the menial tasks."  Then I said, "Oh my God, all I got is menial tasks."  So he said, "But if you'll, if you will show me how," he said, "I will do the washing;" he said "I'll take care of the ironing;" he said, "And if you'll get somebody to do it, I will supervise the house cleaning," he said, "but I'm not cleaning house."
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: He said, "But I'll supervise the house cleaning."  And so he did that, but the rest of what he did was he traveled with me a lot--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because I decided that it is far better to take him along than try to do all those goodbyes, so--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --(laughter) so I would take him, and most of the places he could go.  And Europeans are great travelers because, you see, they have this small, small continent, and so they know how to go from play--one place to another without any trouble.  He didn't speak the English very well at that time, but he knew how to get what he wanted.  And I told him his blue eyes and silver hair would give him anything, and that's what he did.  I'd go to California.  I went out to California one time near L.A. [Los Angeles, California], and he got himself on a bus and went to Knott's Berry Farm [Buena Park, California] and to Disneyland [Anaheim, California] and all the things that was necessary for him to do.  And I know he went because he came back with the pictures (laughter), you see.  So he would do all those things, and, and he had a great time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he really enjoyed that, but it was, it was tough because I worked eighteen, twenty hours a day.  I mean I had very much to do.  It was a tough time.
Speaker 1: How long did you spend with the U.S. Army Recruiting Command?
Speaker 2: Recruiting Command, three years.
Speaker 1: Three years, all right.
Speaker 2: Yes, three years, being on the, being a recruiter--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --great time, and we made the mission too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, indeed, we made the mission.
Speaker 1: When you say you made the mission, tell us what you mean.
Speaker 2: That means that we recruited the numbers of nurses that we were required to recruit for that year.
Speaker 1: For each year?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yes, and that worked out fine, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 323409
Speaker 1: Next assignment?
Speaker 2: My next assignment?
Speaker 1: We're in 1984.
Speaker 2: In '84 [1984] was the Walter Reed Army Medical Center [Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland].
Speaker 1: Back home.
Speaker 2: Back (laughter), but this time over being the chief nurse--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --a vice president for nursing, they would say in the civilian world.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you returned there, well, we'll say 1984.
Speaker 2: That was '84 [1984], yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah, and then we--
Speaker 1: And chief of nursing.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what sort of problems were you facing there?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, we were facing nursing shortages--
Speaker 1: Nursing shortages.
Speaker 2: --in many ways, yeah, which is, was nothing new.  We had done that before.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And as a result of having dealt with the nursing shortages that we were having, we then had to, you know, make sure that we, we could manage to look at other ways that we could get nursing in.  And so, for the first time in our system, we were introduced to contracting for nursing.  And they, the [U.S.] military, defense department [U.S. Department of Defense] was able to get money for contracting that they couldn't get to bring people in, and so we were looking at other kinds of ingenious ways to get nurses on, on active duty.  The other thing that was interesting and was a factor during that time in terms of, of patient care and healthcare in this country was the rise and spread of AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] or HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] in this country.  I saw the first folks that were in the military that were, that were diagnosed with that disease.  I saw them there at, at Walter Reed.  It was some, it was quite a learning experience, you see, for the military and for all those who were participating in trying to help us find a cure or to find some way to at least treat it because it, you know, it was something that you didn't talk about or you didn't admit as far as the military was concerned considering they didn't have any of those people in (laughter), in the [U.S.] Army at that time.  And of course, we all knew what was in the Army at that time, yeah.  But it, it provided many a challenge in dealing with the practice of nursing.  As a matter of fact, that was the place where I thought I had to sit down one day and make some decisions about how it was that I was able to manage myself so that I could do the jobs that I had to do.  And I was getting a lot into speaking, and, and theorizing, and putting forth concepts and, and so forth about the management of nursing practice.  And I wrote articles and, and of course, chapters and books and things of that nature, you know so that I could talk about those things.  But, and we did get our little theory, I mean the model, the model published in a, a book that was written by a couple of my colleagues who were on the academic side at that time out of the University of Kansas [Lawrence, Kansas].  Yeah, that worked out very, very well, yeah.  So I was getting to be a person that was fairly well-known in the practice at the highest level and, and was, and was respected as a knowledgeable individual because I was the surgeon general's consultant on medical-surgical nursing.  And, and so it was easy for them to identify me and to, to use me--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in that kind of way.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it worked out fine.
Speaker 1: And chief of nursing anyway, you, you're holding that title, which was the high exposure.
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: That was 1984 you came.  How long--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --did you stay?
Speaker 2: I stayed three years.
Speaker 1: Three years.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Story_ID: 323410
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Nineteen eighty-seven [1987]--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --you were reassigned.  Is it called reassigned or--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You moved to another (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, reassigned would be great for this one except for this was not the normal reassignment--
Speaker 1: Oh. Tell us about it.
Speaker 2: Because (laughter) this was--
Speaker 1: Here we are in 1987. You tell us.
Speaker 2: --this was the year--that's right.  This was the year that I was considered for promotion to general.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yes, and I made it.
Speaker 1: You made the list?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, yeah, and this time I didn't have to compete with anybody else.
Speaker 1: You were the, there was only one person on the list?
Speaker 2: That's right.  Well, no, no, no, there was only person that could be selected.  And so once I got in, I was in, because I was the chief of the Nurse Corps [U.S. Army Nurse Corps].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And see, that was a brigadier's position at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But there were about sixty of us that were considered.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I will tell you, (laughter) I remember talking to one of the civilians who were in the assistant secretary of [U.S.] Army at that time.  Somebody was talking to me about John Shannon last night.  Do you know John Shannon?
Speaker 1: Shannon, no.
Speaker 2: Shannon, marvelous human being, retired infantry colonel, great guy.  But, someone told me that in order to be a general, you have to be able to know about the politics of the world, and you have to get wise on the politics.  And so, after I got to Walter Reed [Walter Reed Army Medical Center; Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland], I said well, maybe I'd better go see some of these people and you know, have a talk with them.  And I could do some of that at the hospital because sometimes they check through for healthcare.  But then I had to meet the others either socially or in some other kind of way to, to try and find out what they thought, you know, about being, being, about being, being a general and being selected for general.
Story_ID: 322281
Speaker 1: Here we are in 1987.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And all of a sudden, whose name pops up on the list for general?  Clara L. Adams-Ender [HistoryMaker General Clara Adams-Ender].
Speaker 2: You got it, yes, indeed.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now this is an exciting time.  And you are looking around for friends that you can talk to or acquaintances--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --about the politics of being a general.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell us who you visited (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What I found out?
Speaker 1: Yeah, what did you find out?
Speaker 2: Let me tell you--I went first, of course, you know, you, you have a tendency to go back to those folks you know bests and, and that deals with whatever.  I went first to Lil Dunlap [Lillian Dunlap], you know, who's already retired now by this time.
Speaker 1: She's down in San Antonio [Texas].
Speaker 2: She's down in San Antonio, but she's always just as close as telephone.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I'll tell you, I could call any time, day or night.  And I called her up because I said, "Lil, I said you know, they, they're gonna pick the chief of the Corps [U.S. Army Nurse Corps] again this year."  I said, "Do you think I have any possibility of being the chief?"  She said, "Oh yeah, you got a good possibility of being the chief."  She said, "Let me talk to you about a few things."  She said, "Now look at what it is you've done."  And what she would always do any time that she talked to me as the mentor, she said, "Now listen, we just gotta review the bidding."  And she'd go back, and she'd review all the facts of what it was that I had done from before.  She'd look at the advantages and disadvantages of some of the jobs that I'd had and, and what happened as far as they were concerned and, and this type of thing.  And we'd just go through all those things, and then she'd point out the options that she thought I had.  And so she said, "I think you, you're in a good position this time."  And then I had this good friend who said, "Yeah, but go down there and talk to some of those other generals that around this area."  'Cause as I tell people very often, if I had only to rely on women to get to be a general, I would not be a general today.  I had to talk to a lot of those fellows who were out there doing their thing, and several of 'em I had worked for, like Max Thurman [Maxwell R. Thurman], like General Max Thurman.  And, and several of them I had known by various means, you know, either socially or some other way.  And so I talked to them, you know, went to and talked to them.  And at Walter Reed [Walter Reed Army Medical Center; Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland], of course, we have a special unit over there where you could go and see--I mean where they had the, the VIPs to come.  And I was the chief nurse of the hospital, and so I could go and have a talk with them over in those units (clears throat).  As a result of, of this, I was told by my commander, who was over at Walter Reed at that time, because he said, "Clara," he said, "I'm rooting for you."  He said, "I'm gonna do what I can to help you out too," he said, "but why don't you go visit some of the people down on the [U.S.] Army staff?"  So I said, "Oh, okay."
Story_ID: 322282
Speaker 1: So, down on the [U.S.] Army staff was this assistant secretary of the Army for installations.  I think he had installations and environment at that time.  His name was John Shannon, and he'd been a colonel in active duty army.  And so he came over there, and he said--I went down to see him, and I was talking to him about being a general.  And then he said, "Tell me," he said, "Who do you know, Clara [HistoryMaker General Clara Adams-Ender], that, that might be on the board?"  And I said, "Well, sir, I don't know anybody who might be on--."
Speaker 2: Now when you say the board, what is the name--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the--
Speaker 2: --of that board?
Speaker 1: --promotion board.
Speaker 2: The, is that the official name?
Speaker 1: That's the official name, yes, the promotion board.
Speaker 2: The promotion board, okay.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Go ahead.
Speaker 1: The, well, actually the selection board.
Speaker 2: Selection board, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, selection board for promotion.  And so, he said, "Do you know anybody that's, that's going to be on the board?"  I said, "No, I don't anybody on this board."  And he said let me tell you something.  He said, "When you go to be a general," he said, "if you have the choice between having a good record and having friends on the board," he said, "choose friends," (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Right, right.
Speaker 1: I said oh, my goodness, I never knew anything about that.  I don't know anybody who's gonna be on this board.  I don't know a thing.  And so, but he said 'cause everybody's got a good record.  He said if they didn't have a good record they wouldn't put 'em before the board.  He said so you need to have some friends.  So I said all right, sir.  So I went there to see if I could find some friends, and I (laughter), I didn't even know who to look for and what was going on.  But I did happen to know the guy who was the vice chief of staff of the Army.  And he was Max Thurman [Maxwell R. Thurman] at that time, and he and I had been assigned together at Recruiting Command [U.S. Army Recruiting Command].  He was the commander when I went out there to be the chief nurse for recruiting.  And so he said--and he remembered that I made the mission, did what I was supposed to do, made him look good, and he never forgot it, you see.  So he said, "You just keep on doing what you're doing, Clara, over there at that, at, at Walter Reed [Walter Reed Army Medical Center; Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland]."  He said, "Keep on being the chief nurse, and, and we'll see what happens."  So, we went ahead, and when I saw the list, 'cause you did--see, the list of who's on the board does not get published before the board.  It doesn't get pub- published until after the board has sat.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You see, so you never know who's on the board.
Speaker 2: Okay, so that saves them from a lot of pressure.
Speaker 1: That's right; that's right, and, and that's really good that it that goes that way.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But when I saw the list afterward, then I knew the hand of General Max had been out there (laughter), had been out there working around.  So that turned out very well.  But I will tell you, you, it's, it's just a marvelous feeling to get promoted to general, I will tell you.  And it was interesting for me because they--
Speaker 2: Now remind us, you said General Banks--
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: You said General Banks?
Speaker 1: General Max.
Speaker 2: Oh, General Max.
Speaker 1: Max Thurman.
Speaker 2: Oh, Max Thurman, oh, oh.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Max Thurman, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 322283
Speaker 1: When you get on the list, they tell you when the, when, they tell you you're on the list first, okay.  And they tell you when the list is going to be announced, that's what it is.  But normally and in most instances, someone calls you the day before to tell you that you have made the list so that you will know how to behave (laughter) whenever the announcement comes.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So I'm sitting in my office the evening before, and I got this call from the surgeon general of the [U.S.] Army [Quinn H. Becker].  Now he said, "Clara [HistoryMaker General Clara Adams-Ender]," he said, "I need to tell you how come I'm calling."  He says, "You know I don't call you too very often."  I said, "No, sir."  I said, "I've never, as a matter of fact, I've never had a call from you before."  He said, "Well, there's a reason how come I'm doing that today (laughter)."  He said, "You're gonna be the next chief of the [U.S.] Army Nurse Corps."  He said, "Now I want you to go home tonight and practice how you gonna behave" (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He didn't tell you--He didn't call you to tell you, you were on the list.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: He called to--
Speaker 1: He called me talking about I was gonna be it (laughter), so--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so I said, "Yes, sir, I'm ready.  I will be ready tomorrow."  So the next morning, and this is the lit- they tell you the time the list is supposed to be announced and everything, and the next morning I got this call at 11:00 promptly.  And who was it, except for Lillian Dunlap.
Speaker 2: Oh (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now Lillian Dunlap done told somebody: "All y'all may tell, but I'm gonna be first (laughter)."
Speaker 2: She's calling you from--
Speaker 1: So she ca--
Speaker 2: --from San Antonio [Texas]?
Speaker 1: From San Antonio, absolutely--
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: --from San Antonio.  She said, "I got the message, and I want you to know that I'm here to announce."  Well, I'll tell you that was a great call.  I mean that was one of the greatest calls I've gotten in my lifetime, that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yep, absolutely.
Speaker 1: --Lil would call.  I mean it was very appropriate that she'd call me too--
Speaker 2: She's a retired general, but she still has contacts.
Speaker 1: That's right. That's right, indeed.
Speaker 2: Got you.
Speaker 1: She got the message, and nobody called me until after Lil called either (laughter).  But that was great.  And you know, the nurses was all standing--
Speaker 2: Now what, what was the date of that?  Do you remember?
Speaker 1: Lord, what day was that?  I don't remember, no.
Speaker 2: What month was it?
Speaker 1: I remember it was July.
Speaker 2: July of 1987.
Speaker 1: That's right, 'cause they moved me out shortly after that time.  I had to be gone from Walter Reed [Walter Reed Army Medical Center; Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland] in a month.  Yeah, that was July of '87 [1987].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I got promoted in September.
Speaker 2: And chief of staff, chief of--
Speaker 1: No, chief of the Army Nurse Corps.
Speaker 2: Chief, chief of Army Nurse, Nurse Corps.
Speaker 1: Nurse Corps, yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 322284
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And that person [chief of the U.S. Army Nurse Corps] manages all of the, manages all of the nurses, active duty, retired--I mean not ret- re- retired.  Nobody manages the retired--active duty, reserve, and guard--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --you know.
Speaker 2: You're at the top--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --of the pyramid.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: That means you have done all you can do in this part.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And at that time, I had about twenty-two thousand nurses serving all over the world--
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: Twenty-two thousand.
Speaker 2: And you were responsible.
Speaker 1: And I was responsible.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'll tell you, it was interesting.  It was awesome.  So I, I said oh, chief of the Nurse Corps.  And of course, my boss, shortly after Lil [Lillian Dunlap] called, because I'm sure she called him and said, "Listen, I get the first call."  And he was a two-star too, but it didn't matter to Lil.  Lil said, "I get the first call, so you can go around there afterwards," 'cause that's the person who was really supposed to bring you the message.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, he came around afterwards, and he said congratulations.  He said that, that's wonderful.  And I was glad because I was just certain he was gonna be the next surgeon general, yeah, and he probably would have except for, can't say it.  And so we got that done, and they said listen, finally the chief of the Corps at that time, who was General Slewitzke [Connie L. Slewitzke], finally called me and said, "Listen, you've got to figure out what time you can, you know, when you can get away and when you can start your orientation here because you know you gotta be in here by September.  And you know, all the parties and everything that goes on in between, we'll get those done, but you need to know that you probably need to be out of there by the end of July."  Oh, goodness, and then the first thing you do is you think about all the things that you haven't done.  I mean you've managed get it, but you got some things that you got hanging out there that's got to get taken care of.  So I finally called Heinz [Heinz Ender] that day, finally got around to calling him before that (laughter) evening was over, 'cause you couldn't, couldn't tell him before; I couldn't tell him.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I couldn't, couldn't not tell.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: I mean there are some things you can't even tell a spouse.  And so I just kept the information, and then he finally got the message.  He said, "Oh, we have to go celebrate."  I said (laughter), "Listen, first I gotta get out of here."  And so, we did much of that, and that was a great time.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And those nurses.
Speaker 2: Now you mentioned the general who was head of the [U.S.] Army at that time.  Was that the Polish general who later became head of the joint chiefs?  I heard you--
Speaker 1: Who was it?
Speaker 2: You, you gave--
Speaker 1: I mentioned--
Speaker 2: --you gave me a name of the--
Speaker 1: For--
Speaker 2: --general who was head of the Army.
Speaker 1: Oh, that Max Thurman [Maxwell R. Thurman] that was the, he was the, he was the vice-
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, Max--
Speaker 1: --chief of staff.  Max was the vice chief of staff at that time, yeah.  He never got to be the chief, but he was the vice chief of staff--
Speaker 2: You met--
Speaker 1: --yeah.  I, the head of the Nurse Corps at that time was Connie Slewitzke.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay, that's where I'm--
Speaker 1: Yeah, she was head of the Nurse Corps.
Speaker 2: --getting it mixed up, okay.
Speaker 1: Right, yeah--
Speaker 2: Good enough.
Speaker 1: --she was head of the Nurse Corps.
Speaker 2: Okay, good enough.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: All right, so--
Speaker 1: The chief of staff of the Army was a guy named Carl Vuono.  And it's important to know him because when I get ready to leave the, the Nurse Corps, he's gonna figure a very important in my life, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So I went off.  I left Walter Reed [Walter Reed Army Medical Center; Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland].
Speaker 2: In, in the end of July.
Speaker 1: End of July.
Speaker 2: And took your assignment, your desk over at the Pentagon [Washington, D.C.] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's right, that's right.
Speaker 2: As chief of the Army--
Speaker 1: As--Army Nurse Corps designee--
Speaker 2: --the Army Nurse Corps, okay.
Speaker 1: --designee.
Speaker 2: Designee?
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause you can't go in there until you get promoted, you see.
Speaker 2: Ah.
Story_ID: 322285
Speaker 1: So I went in and they gave me a little office.  And, and I, my job was to then get my team organized you see, because you gotta have an assistant chief, and you gotta have a director of personnel immediately.  And because mostly those folks kind of go when the other person leaves, you see, because that's how, that's, you know, just kind of an agreement.  The, the, the assistant chief of the Corps [U.S. Army Nurse Corps] has to be picked, yeah, yeah, but the, the director of personnel you have to appoint, you see.  And so I had to get those folks together.  But there are some other assignments that you have to look at too, and one of them was the one that I had come from in recruiting.  That is a, that is a key assignment for the chief of the Nurse Corps because that's the person that provides the strength.  You see, they're gonna bring all the nurses in, and you gotta make sure that that person is there and on your side, you see.  Well, when you start doing these things, you have a domino effect, because when you move one person out of there, then you gotta move somebody else into there, you see.  And I had, I had to first look for somebody to go to my job, you see, because that way, and, and that is by far, the chief nurse at Walter Reed [Walter Reed Army Medical Center; Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland] is by far the most influential position to have in getting picked to be chief of the Corps (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.  But that was your decision to make.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Well, I was working on that, yeah, and I got that done.  But we, we started doing those things, trying to get the assignments.  Well, my dilemma was picking that person to be the assistant chief.  And I had a little bit of time to do that but not a lot.  But I had to get that person selected, you see, fairly soon, because the individual who was in there as the, the chief was not leaving for a couple of months because that's a statutory position, and she had a couple of months before she left.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So I had some time to get a name, but I needed to get somebody selected pretty quick so they'd get on orders and get over there.  Well, I went to pick this individual to be the chief.  And one of these things I had, one of these things that I learned way back there, and I think I talked to you a little bit about that, that the importance of networking and the importance of helping people out whenever you can, because that served me in great stead when I went to be chief of the Corps.  There were a lot of people that I had befriended in a lot of situations, and it was time to call in a few of the chits, and so I did.
Story_ID: 322286
Speaker 1: But one of the things that I knew I needed in an assistant chief of the Corps [U.S. Army Nurse Corps] was a person who knew Washington [D.C.], you see, because I had not been assigned in Washington before at the headquarters level.  See, I'd never been assigned there.  And I, but I needed that information and somebody who knew some folks who were in that area because they knew how to work and how to connect and network with the folks that were in--
Speaker 2: They knew where the bodies were buried.
Speaker 1: They did, and they knew how to deal with it.  See, I had worked a lot with them, but I had never been assigned there--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you see.  So, I said that's cool.  I can, I can handle this, and so I went out and picked a guy that was assigned in Europe when I was assigned.  He was down at the headquarters of the 7th Medical Command as an IG [inspector general].  And I was the chief nurse at Frankfurt [Frankfurt Army Regional Medical Center, Frankfurt, Germany] you see.  And I knew the whole IG business, so whenever he got assigned over as an IG, I called him up and talked about how to do your IG business and how best to do that and all that type of thing.  And he was appreciative of that because you don't get a chance to practice being an IG.  You get assigned to do business, so it was good, and he always, he always remembered that I had done that.  Well, I was, I said you know, that's the guy I think I really need to be chief of the--to be assistant chief of the Corps, so I went looking for him.  Well, he was on vacation.  So this little, there was a little major that called me.  He, John [John Hudock], was full colonel.  And it was a major that, that I called and talked to.  And I said, "Oh, I'm looking for a Colonel Hudock."  I said, "Do you know when he'll be back?"  And he said, "Well, he'll be back in, in two weeks."  He took a two-week vacation, and he just went out today.  So I said oh, my goodness.  So I said well, I gotta wait two weeks to talk to John, but I'd better talk to some other people in between that.  So, I started talking to some other folks.  And that evening I was in my home, and I got this call on the telephone.  And I said--he said, "Hello."  He said, "Colonel," he said, "this is John Hudock."  He said, "I hear you're looking for me," (laughter).  Well, that little captain that was in his office called him up and said, "Hey, Colonel Adams-Ender [HistoryMaker General Clara Adams-Ender], who is just been selected to be chief of the Corps was looking for you, and she left this number (laughter)."  And so he called me from his vacation down at the beach (laughter), down in Ocean City [Maryland], on the beach, calling up.  So, I called him up and I said, "John," I said, "I want to, I wanted to ask you if you wanted to be the assistant chief of the Corps," I said, "because I would certainly like to see you get selected, you see."  Now we had to convene a board, you know, do all that stuff.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But I just wanted to see who was interested, 'cause I didn't wanna pick nobody and have them say no, I'm gonna retire next week.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Forget that.  So I talked to several people, and then we went over and, and he said oh yeah, I'd be very interested.  He said but I wasn't coming back until Monday or Tuesday, but I'll be back next Monday.  So he came back the next Monday.  We sat down and talked, and I talked about, you know, what your philosophy is, what are your values, did all the things I know how to do to put people together, and I said, "John, I think we ought to pick you."  But see, I had to make sure that the folks that I put on the board understood who I needed to look at, and these are three or four folks that are in line.  I try not to give 'em the specific person, but I said, "These are the three or four folks that I have in line."  I said, "And I will tell you, we are gonna, this is gonna be a no holds bar thing."  I said, "We are gonna deal with the qualified people, that's what."  Well, John Hudock came out as the qualified person.
Story_ID: 322287
Speaker 1: Before the sun went down that day, I was called to the deputy surgeon general's office.  And he said, "Hey," he said, "I heard you had the board today for chief of the Corps [U.S. Army Nurse Corps]," 'cause when I came back, you know, I told the, the, the outgoing chief, whom I'd selected, you know.  And she didn't say anything to me at all, but she didn't like the fact that I had selected a man.  So she went--now, never mind this is a nurse--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and a damn good nurse, but she did not like the fact that he was a man.  And I didn't, you know, I never even thought that anybody would have any prejudice against it.  I mean these guys serve like I serve, you see.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But, sometimes I don't think about that kind of stuff when I ought to.  But I, I, I went around to see the, the deputy surgeon general.  And he said, "Hey," he said, "I'd heard you picked a male to be chief of the Corps."  I said, "No, sir."  He said, "Didn't you pick John Hudock?"  I said, "Yeah, yes, sir."  He said, "That's a male nurse."  I said, "No, sir."  I said, "He is not a male nurse.  He's the best nurse.
Speaker 2: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: He said, "Well, I will tell you," he said, "there are those that within your Corps who don't like the fact that you picked a male."  And I knew who it was (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right, the outgoing.
Speaker 1: That's right, but I didn't, you know, it didn't bother me.  So I said, "Yes, sir," I said, "and they, there may be, I said, but let me tell you a little bit about the reason how come I picked John."  I said, "He's been on staff here.  He had spent five years on the [U.S.] Army staff.  He had served in assignments having to do with personnel and the management of personnel.  There is no better person to do that than an individual who's really gonna be an operations officer, because he has to run the Corps day to day.  And you've got to know the people that's out there running it, where to assign them, what to do with them, and he knew that better than anybody else did, and plus he had provided the policy."  I said, "You can't get anybody better than that to do that."  I said, "It just so happens that he's a male."  I said, "But you understand I'm picking the best nurse."
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And he said, "Clara [HistoryMaker General Clara Adams-Ender]," he said, "I understand," he said, "but I was just told to bring it to your attention that this is the first time that a male has ever been picked."  I said, "Hallelujah (laughter).  I'm glad we did that."  So we went ahead, we got that done; we got that settled.  We got Connie [Connie L. Slewitzke] unruffled, hopefully, and we didn't, didn't matter.  I mean we still had to run the Corps, you see.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so we went ahead and, and started doing some of those things.  So we got that out of the way and the, the, the little fluff blew over, and I went on and picked the other people and moved some folks around in various places that turned out to be a very good team, I think--
Speaker 2: All right.
Story_ID: 322288
Speaker 1: And we decided that there was a number of things that we needed to do.  I'm just gonna tell you one thing that I think was--well actually a couple, two.  One was, we needed to make sure that we had secured the numbers of full colonel positions.  You see, because remember I was talking about how rare full colonels are.  You have to have your numbers so that you can get the troops to go along with them, you see.  So we had to make sure that we secured that number.  John Hudock worked the medical grade table, which secures all of the positions for every member of the [U.S.] Army Medical Department.  He worked that position, and they finally had to go to the [U.S.] Army with the list.  And the, the director of personnel for the Army said this list is approved.  And it was great that the director of per- the deputy chief of staff of personnel was what his name was--what his title was, deputy chief of staff of personnel was out at Recruiting Command [U.S. Army Recruiting Command] too when I was a chief nurse (laughter).  You know, see, somebody told me one of these days everything's gone fall into place.  And I will tell you, the people were falling into place.  The surgeon general had been the classmate of this General Ono [ph.] whenever they were in the War College [United States Army War College, Carlisle, Pennsylvania], and so he knew him very well, you see.  And he said, "You go over there and you see Al Ono, and you do everything he says because he's the best personnel man around (laughter)."  And so I said, "Yes, sir, I can do that."  And so that took care of that, so we got John over there, and he got that grade table approved.  And until today, the [U.S.] Army Nurse Corps then has the numbers of colonels that they need to keep our Corps up at a certain level (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: So that worked out fine.  The second thing that happened that probably got me continued on active duty, because when you get to be chief of the Nurse Corps, at that time you knew that this was your last assignment because that is a Title 10 position in the United States Code.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Chief of the Nurse Corps is a brigadier general, at that time, was a brigadier general.  I, I keep, I keep saying at that time because things change.  At that time it was brigadier general four years and then you do one of two things: you retire, or you must revert to the rank of full colonel in order to serve further in the Nurse Corps.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Well, it, those rules were made--
Speaker 2: Which means that there will always be only one--
Speaker 1: Only one.
Speaker 2: --general.
Speaker 1: Only one general--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --in the Nurse Corps.  That's, that's the way it's set up right now.  So, I had to, you know, I knew that I was going to be doing that, and I'd be finished after that time.  So I was looking at, you know, the whole situation and system of what I'm gonna do in order to be able to deal with what I gotta, gotta leave, do to leave my legacy in this place, because you gotta think about what your legacy's gonna look like.  You know, you don't wanna run around and not having done anything when you get to the end.  So I looked at the business of--'cause at this, at this time the Army was beginning to shrink, and they were beginning to reduce the force.  And we reduced a hundred and seventy-plus-thousand troops between 1987 and 1990.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Largest, largest reduction of forces anywhere in the world that you reduce people like that, you know (unclear).  So I--
Speaker 2: So in the first, your first three years--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you had that huge reduction?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh, Lord, I mean, and they were doing the Army Nurse Corps the same way.  And so I said now listen, we gotta have some nurses over here, and we gotta figure out how we're gonna get them to make, to be able to sustain the force in the out years.  So John Hudock, who was a brill- I mean a, he was a brilliant detailed person, all right.  He, and he had been there doing policy all of this time, so he said, "Ma'am," he said, "I wanna go do some research."  So he went back and he found a law on the books that was passed back in the time in the '60s [1960s] when we had that problem with nurses before.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And the law that was passed out of [U.S.] Congress and it never gone from the books, had passed out of Congress that said that you could have enlisted people. You could choose enlisted people to become officers if they had two years of general education courses.  And they could go back for the last two years to obtain a degree in nursing in, a, a degree in nursing in the two-year period of time.  And the Army would pay them at the current grade held, whatever grade they held, and would send them off to school, just give them the time to go to school for that period.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So he said I think if we can get approval of the numbers that we need to go and get, then I can, that we can to, we can argue the point that we can increase our retention and at the same time be able to keep folks on and do a bid for upper mobility for the Army Nurse Corps.  He said but you need to understand that in order to be able to get these spaces, you have to go and request them directly from the chief of staff of the Army.  Well, the chief of staff of the Army does not give you anything without checking with all of his other people, to make sure that you're worthy of having that (laughter).  So, I had to go and visit some people before I could go see the chief [Carl Vuono] about these spaces.
Story_ID: 322289
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, so, John [John Hudock] went, he did the research, and we found that we could get the, we could, we could put the students in school, but we had to get the spaces.  And you had to go directly to the chief of staff of the [U.S.] Army [Carl Vuono] to get the spaces.  So, I made an appointment with the chief of staff of the Army.  And I did it far enough out so that I could see all of his deputy chiefs of staff, the important ones, before I went there.  And I had to go to the deputy chief of staff of operations, personnel.  You had to go to the program analysis and evaluation people, and you had to deal with the, the folks over on the enlisted side, you know, to, to make sure that everybody knew what the deal was in terms of what I was requesting.  Well, I went to the guy who was the program analysis evaluation at that time, PA and E we always called him.  And he and I had worked together before.  And so he said to me, he said, "Clara [HistoryMaker General Clara Adams-Ender]," he said, "the Army's winding down."  He said, "We're not, we're not putting any more folks in here."  He said, "I don't think you need those spaces."  I said, "Sir, I have to keep enough folks in the [U.S.] Army Nurse Corps, and this is the reason how come I need to do it.  You know, these people have been on; they're seasoned folks at this point and time.  They're likely to be retained."  And all these other kind of things. I put it all out there.  He said, "I disagree."  The others, I got concurrence from everybody else, but I couldn't get this guy to agree.  Well, if we go before the chief, the chief's not gonna hear any fighting between the PA and E and the chief of the Army Nurse Corps, I mean, you know (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so, and, and I wasn't really even supposed to be there.  The surgeon general was supposed to be there.  The surgeon general said "No, no, no, I'm not going to try to fight a nurse battle.  You go take care of that."  So I said "All right, I'm here, sitting in here for me and the surgeon general."  So I got there and we started to talk about--no, I was getting ready to go to the meeting.  And I said well, I'm not going to, I'm not gonna get the general--I've forgotten his name now--to change his mind, you know, Bill.  I know his first name was Bill.  I said, I'm not getting him to change his mind, I said but I still gotta go see the chief; I'm sorry.  So, I don't know what happened.  I went off to Hawaii on vacation.  I said I'm taking a break.  So I took a break 'cause I, I--and when I was coming back I was seeing he chief next day, changed my appointment so I was seeing the chief nine [o'clock] in the morning, I called my hairdresser, say get in here and get my hair done (laughter), five o'clock in the morning, got my hair done and got ready to go.  And just as I was about to leave her office I called my office.  And they said, "Oh, ma'am, yeah, you're still on with the chief at nine o'clock.  And by the way, the PA and E called, and he said that he will agree that you need those spaces."  Let me tell you, when that happens to you, you don't ask anybody any questions.  Now you just say thank you and go to the next thing.  We went up.  We got in front of the chief.  We talked about the issues.  We--and, and he voiced what he thought was, was his hesitation at that time, but he, but when he got asked do you concur, he nodded his head, yes I do, and so that worked out fine.  And so the che- I had asked for a hundred spaces, and chief gave me a 125.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: So I think I made a pretty good case (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yes, you did.
Speaker 1: Got 125 spaces and I will tell you, we had some happy enlisted people, because at that time, see, we had 5500 enlisted personnel in the [U.S.] Army Medical Department that had two years of college or above.  See, that's one thing that a lot of people don't understand, is that the all-volunteer army bought a, brought us, the all-volunteer army brought us a very well educated Army, very well-educated.  We took people we could--we didn't take anybody who didn't have high school.  And the most of 'em had two years of college or above, and they were joining up like crazy.  I mean it was working out just fine.  And so, I was gonna just only take the medics.  Well, John Shannon is back over there in the office.  He said, "Clara, you can't only take the medics.  You've got to take--you've gotta open it up to everybody."  So we did.  We opened it up to everybody.  And I'll tell you, some of those folks came out the artillery offices, and some of those folks came out here from transportation.  They came out from various areas, but we took the well-qualified people to go into that program.  And those enlisted folks were very happy to be able to do that.  And they got, they, they got finished, got promoted to second lieutenant, and came on active duty, and came back on active duty and stayed just like we said they would.  They stayed, and many of 'em stayed 'til retirement.  I'm going, as a matter of fact, I'm going down to Texas to, I'm gonna retire one next week because she went in the program a, a little time later, 'cause the program still goes; it's still going on 'til today.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  They have, back now they choose a hundred people a year.  But they still send them off to any accredited college or university with a school of nursing or college of nursing in this country.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: And they, once they graduate, they're able to, to come on active duty as second lieutenants, yeah.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: So we did our thing for upward mobility.
Speaker 2: You did your thing.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) For sure.
Speaker 2: Now this was all done during that three-year period, '87 [1987] to '90 [1990], is--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --is that it?
Speaker 1: --yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Well, actually, no, '87 [1987] to '91 [1991], we probably finished--
Speaker 2: Eighty-seven [1987] to, to, to--
Speaker 1: Yeah, probably finished in early '91 [1991].
Speaker 2: --to, to '91 [1991].
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause that was my period, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, now--
Speaker 1: And I was the eighteenth chief, yeah, of the Army Nurse Corps.
Speaker 2: Okay, eighteenth chief.
Speaker 1: Eighteenth chief--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --right.
Story_ID: 322290
Speaker 1: Now, there are still two years left before you retire.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Tell us what you do during those two years.
Speaker 2: Yeah, could I just back up one second and tell you--
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: --my last year, last two years in the Nurse Corps [U.S. Army Nurse Corps]?
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: I, actually in, in year 1989 I became the director of personnel for the surgeon general of the [U.S.] Army [Frank F. Ledford, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that meant that I was responsible for all of the healthcare professionals and making sure that they got policy developed and everything that, that determined what it was happen to them.  We did all the credentialing.  We did all of the discipline that was necessary at that time in terms of signing off on it, even though they were disciplined in their commands, and then we checked in on all of that.  Well, in that particular assignment, when the, we went to the first Gulf War, which we did in 1990--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --we had to send over the personnel to that, to that unit, I mean to that conflict.  And I was in the surgeon general's office at that time, so had to coordinate with Forces Command [U.S. Army Forces Command] to make sure that all of the medics got sent.  See, because the most of the medics that are needed on active duty in the Army are in the Reserve [U.S. Army Reserve].
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Seventy percent of the medics are in the Reserve, you see.  And so we had to call up units and get units coordinated to go.  And then we found out there were people out there who hadn't been to the career courses.  And, and there is a policy within the [U.S.] military that you can't send people out to do certain jobs unless they've had the training to do it.  You haven't been to your career courses, you've missed a couple of things.  So we had to send folk off for three months to get that done.  And I mean there were a lot of things we had to catch up during that time.  But I, I was involved in making sure that the medics got off to the, to, to the, the war.  And then, of course, they got over there they didn't have very much to do.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I said get them home because, see, I used to be one of them medics.  If you don't give physicians, nurses, and them other medics something to do, they get into mischief.  So I said get 'em out of there (laughter) because we don't want anybody into mischief.  And so then we started rotating 'em back (laughter) at that time.  But that was a busy time, yeah.
Speaker 1: That sounds like it.
Story_ID: 322291
Speaker 1: And then just as I was getting ready to leave, the chief [Carl Vuono] called up one day, because the chief never forgot that I got more spaces out of him than he asked for.  And I never knew how I did it, but (laughter) I must have said something that struck a chord, because he said, "Yeah, we, we need them nurses, you know."  And so, and after he retired he said I know how come I did that for you, so you'd take care of me in retirement (laughter).  But I, we, he called me and said--well, he actually called the surgeon general [Frank F. Ledford, Jr.].  And the surgeon general called me and said, "Listen, he said the chief said that he think that rule is not good, that whenever you get finished with the [U.S.] Army Nurse Corps, that you have to retire."  He said, "Because in the first place, it cheats you out of two years of payment as a brigadier."  See, when you get to be brigadier, you can stay on for six years.
Speaker 2: You can stay over six years?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: But see, because we had that rule of not being able to stay in the Army Nurse Corps position--
Speaker 2: It was gonna cut--
Speaker 1: --but four years, they was gone cut me out of two years of pay--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --you see, so the chief said he didn't think that ought to happen to you.  So, he said if you want to, he will continue you on in an Army billet.  He'll transfer you to the line army, and you can become a line army officer for your last two years.  I said, "Oh.  That sounds pretty good."  Well, see, the first thing that the chief tried to do was the chief tried to get me to go and be a, to get me a job as, in one of the health in was--as a commander of one of the medical centers as a medic.  But the surgeon general said, "The American people expects that its physicians will run its hospitals."  The American people don't care.  The American people just cares that their children are taken care of, all right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But the surgeon cared (laughter).
Speaker 2: And his word was final.
Speaker 1: That's, that's right, so--
Speaker 2: Got you.
Speaker 1: The chief said, "That's no problem."  He said, "Listen, Clara [HistoryMaker General Clara Adams-Ender]," he said, "I'll send you down to Fort Belvoir [Virginia], and you'll have your own damn hospital."  And so he did; he sent me down to Fort Belvoir.  And that's the, that's the rule of when you become a commander.  You take care of everything, all of the property and everything in view (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And those medic, I mean those medics, yeah, was on the base at Fort Belvoir, so I was the commander.  And that hospital is right out my window over there. I can see 'em.  I said yep, I'll take charge of them too, so the command the commander reported to me.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, commander of the hospital had to report to me.  I was the commander of the base.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: I commanded the base, and so he had to report to me, and so that--and you know, he never had any problem with that, you see.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: It was the surgeon general with a problem.  But you know, those kind of things happen, but we took care of that, and that went on right on to the next thing, no problem.  So--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --that's where I spent my last two years--
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: --as the deputy commanding general of the Military District of Washington.
Speaker 2: Yep, I'm gonna write that down, deputy command general--
Speaker 1: Deputy commanding general of the Military District of Washington slash--
Speaker 2: Military District.
Speaker 1: Mili- Military District of Washington, yeah--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --slash commanding general, Fort Belvoir, Virginia.  And that was my station.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But both, superb assignments.  I mean, you know, it's two jobs, and it's two assignments because the, the Military District of Washington is primarily a ceremonial unit for Washington [D.C.] and there the, the Third United States Infantry, the Old Guard is assigned there.  In their ceremonial unit they do the, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier [Arlington, Virginia], and the do all of the funerals in Arlington National Cemetery [Arlington, Virginia] and all that kind--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Well, we did a lot.  And, and, and they are also responsible for doing all of the formal ceremonies for the president of the United States.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: All right, so, that's what we did primarily up there.  High--
Speaker 2: My, my--
Speaker 1: --volume.
Speaker 2: --next door neighbor is a part of that unit.
Speaker 1: Oh, is that right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: High volume, high vis [high visibility], high vis job, okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so I had an opportunity to do numbers of, of, of ceremonies and that type of thing--
Story_ID: 322292
Speaker 1: And I will just tell you, it was great to have Heinz [Heinz Ender] at my side, because in the first place Heinz, and I haven't talked too very much about him and what he was about, but Heinz had been in World War II [WWII].  And we talked about wrong side.  He was, he was in the German Army, of course--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --at that time.  But he fought in North Africa with Rommel [Erwin Rommel].  And of course, when he came here and the, and the generals found out that he'd been in with Rommel in North Africa--I mean, we'd go to social functions, and I'd just lose him because they'd take him off, and they'd go to talking about--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --the war and give him beer and they'd talk about everything over there and what Rommel did, because see, Rommel walked among his troops and did all the stuff.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so he was, he was able to talk about--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --what went on there.  So he did very well, and plus he was a gracious, gracious spouse.  I mean, you know, he, I'd, we'd say gracious first gentleman because he was able to, you know, talk to all the wives, and he'd kiss the hands, and he'd did, oh, he, he did marvelous.  He had, and he had a great time too.  I mean, he considered this a privilege (laughter).  He had a great time doing that.
Speaker 2: And the two of you had a great life?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.  Oh, we had a great life, we really did, wonderful together.  And, and I went down to Fort Belvoir [Virginia] to do that position [commanding general] down there, and he joined the Officers' Wives Club [Officers' Spouses' Club], worked with them, worked with the Army Community Service, and did those things that he had done from before.  And, and, and he'd, and when I was at Walter Reed [Walter Reed Army Medical Center; Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland] he worked with the Red Cross [American Red Cross] over there, and he worked with the Red Cross here, so he did a lot of volunteer work in terms (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This may be very painful for you, but just leading up to his crossing over--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --I know that maybe bring back--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: -- bad memories, but could you--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --just--
Speaker 1: No, I got a lot of good memories (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It was 19--no, it was 2000, was it?  Two thousand one [2001], 2001 I think was the year.  We, we had been traveling around because we traveled a lot in retirement.  And he told me--I was going to take a job after retirement.  I would, I had been invited to be the deputy librarian of the congress.  I thought that would be a great job for me.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Heinz thought it was nothing but a job (laughter).  He said, he said, "The thing it means is that you'll do another twelve, fourteen hours a day.  And you promised me when you retired that you would spend some time with me."  And he said, "I'm eighty years old this year.  If you're not gonna do it this year, when?"  So I said, "That's a point.  Now there's a point."  And finally, he said, "If you take another job, we are divorced."  I said, "Oh, that's it, no, no jobs.  We're gonna do this."  So I went over and I decided what I could do, and involved him with it at the same time, 'cause I knew I couldn't do anything, I mean nothing.  I had been working since I was five years old.  There was no way I was gonna sit in anybody's corner anywhere.  And, and, and, and I didn't know how not to work.  That's how come I was looking for a job mostly.  And he told me, "Check the bank book, and you may not have to go get a job."  So I said, "Oh, yeah, yeah, but," finally I said, "No, this man is serious."  So, I decided that I would not work.  So I, but I had to do something, so I started a little management consulting company, and I run that 'til today.  And it was designed so that when I had to go out and go do work, and it was traveling, that he could go along with me, yeah, and that's what he did.  And, and Heinz was never a burden to anybody.  He would go to places.  Only, only thing he wanted to know was we are here now; when are we leaving?  And you tell him when we're leaving, then he'd go out and find his tour and do whatever was necessary and go about his business doing his tour and make it back at night in time so that he could, you know, go to the parties and do whatever is necessary--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --or to dinner.  So we were doing that.
Story_ID: 322293
Speaker 1: And then in 2001, he came to me one day and said listen--we were getting ready to go to Hawaii, and he said listen.  He said, "I have to tell you something."  I said, "What?"  He said, "I've been having this pain in my side for about two weeks."  But Heinz [Heinz Ender] never wanted to go to physicians.  He said you go to physicians too much, he'll find something wrong with you, forget it, so he wouldn't go.  So I said well, listen, would you like to go to the doctor?  "No, I would not like to go to the doc, but if it's there tomorrow, I will go."  So he got up the next morning it was still there, so he went.  So went over.  We found out that he had appendicitis.  And he's eighty-seven by this time, you know.  And he had appendicitis, and it took them all day to find that out, but it was good that we got there at the time that we did because it was pretty big, yeah.  So they said we need to operate right way, so they operated right away.  And when they got in they found that he had a bit of cancer behind his appendix.  And so the doc called me and said, "Listen, we found that there's a tumor behind the appendix," he said, "but we'll go, we're going to do a wide resection."  And he said, "I think we can get the most of it, so, if not all."  So he had the surgery.  And he went back and forth for a couple of years to see the physician, and he was clear.  But then one time when he went in for his checkup, the cancer had come back, and I mean it came back with a vengeance, all over his abdomen, everywhere.  And so the doc said, "Listen, there's nothing we can do if it's not generali- I mean it's not localized we can't do anything."  And so we did, he decided that he would not have the, the cancer treatment.  He said, "I do not want to spend my final days puking all over the place," he said, "So, and plus I, I don't want my immune system torn down, because when they do, I don't have any defense at all."  He said, "So, I'll, I'll just do conservative kind of therapy."  And he said, "I'll eat well, and I'll do all the things."  So the doc arranged with him to do that, and so he did that.  And it was interesting because he wanted to go one time to have a treatment in Germany and because that he learned that the Germans use mistletoe and injections and--mistletoe and what was the other one?  Oh, dandelion injections to complement the treatment that they give for folks who have cancer.  So he went and stayed in the hospital for two weeks up in this area, and they, and they treated him, and then he came back home.  So when he came back home he went to see his physician at, at--this is about a year and a half into his treatment.  He went to see his physician at Walter Reed [Walter Reed Army Medical Center; Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland], and he said, "Well, doc," he said, "What do you think we ought to do next?"  And doc said well, doctor, and he said you have lived a whole lot longer than some of us thought (laughter) that we would--that you would live.  He says so, so suppose you tell us what we should do next (laughter).  So he, about four months later he died and because he started to get the ascites and collecting fluid and that type of thing, and he died.  But he was conscious right up 'til the last few moments and matter of fact, was joking with us before.  And he said listen, he said don't let anybody tell you.  I had a great life, he said, and, and much of it was time with you.  He said who would have thought a little boy from Silesia would be married to a general (laughter).  So, it was great; it was great, and I got great memories.
Speaker 2: He sounds like a wonderful person.
Speaker 1: Oh, a wonderful guy, really was, and I've got great memories, twenty-three years we were married.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: And, and I've got great memories.
Story_ID: 322294
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this in winding down, is there anything that you would want to do differently if you had the chance to go back and change it?
Speaker 2: I've told people this very often, and they think I'm nuts when I say this, but I'm gonna tell you again.  If I had to do it all over again, I would still join the [U.S.] Army, but I'd get rich first--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --(laughter), and then I'd join the Army.  Let me tell you, when you get moneymaking out of the way, you are free to be as creative as you want to be about anything (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or as eccentric as you want.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, and the eccentric side I think is what I'm leaning towards these days (laughter).  But it is, it, you know, real, really, if you, if you, if you really value eating, you have to be able to make money in some kind of way.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know I told you I used to do the little theater and that type of thing.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I used to hang out with those folks, and they'd say oh, we gotta hang out 'til 2:00 in the morning the papers come out so we can see what--well, they value being starving artists.  I never wanted to be--I said listen, I got to go to a job tomorrow morning (laughter) because I like to eat--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you see.  And so that's probably the only thing that I would do differently--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --is I would make sure I was financially secure, and then I'd join the Army, because then I'd be free to do whatever; wouldn't matter to me where I got, where I was promoted or--just you know, just go through and be free to do what you want to do.  Oh, it would be wonderful.  But the world's not built like that (laughter).
Story_ID: 322295
Speaker 1: Is there anything that you can think of that we may have--oh, I know one thing that we've overlooked, and that is your mother [Caretha Sapp Leach]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and the news, of how you received the news--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --when you first heard it.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You were Germany at the time.
Speaker 2: No, I was in Recruiting Command [U.S. Army Recruiting Command].
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: I had come back, yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, oh, you had come back.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had come back, right.
Speaker 1: And you know, what your reaction and emotions were.
Speaker 2: Listen, from the time that my father [Otha Leach] died in 1976 until she died in 1982, we had not only become mother and daughter, 'cause we always were that, because she, she always kept up with me.  And, and even when I wasn't coming home she was keeping up with me and what I was doing.  But we had really become best friends.  That's really what happened.  And, and I'd go and visit her, and we'd sit down and we'd talk about this and anything, you know.  And, but mother was always easy to talk to.  I mean I didn't have any difficulty from before.  It's just that I wanted to get outside and run with the boys and do all that kind of stuff.  Well, I really learned during that period probably more than any other time in my life what it means to have a woman as best friends.  And that was, and that I have dedicated the rest of my life to, is making sure that I have at least ten women in my life that--
Speaker 1: Good.
Speaker 2: --kind of guides what it is that I'm doing, 'cause I'll tell you, they, they, they provide you with different kind of information, you see, and so I have to have 'em around.  Well, she had been over the years having problems with her arthritis, but she had also developed peripheral vascular disease.  And I will never understand all of this time because mother--well, I guess she was pretty, pretty, pretty careful about her diet (unclear) 'cause she never had problem with diabetes or any of those things.  But it was the, the, the arthritis and the peripheral vascular disease that, that really did her in.  And she, we were about to build her house because Heinz [Heinz Ender] had come over, and he said oh yeah, we gotta, we gotta make sure she gets out of here, you mother deserves a better house than that.  And I was gonna build it before I went to over, but then I got orders to go to Germany.  And she said no, just wait 'til you come back, and we'll get it all done.  Well, we were getting ready to get that done.  And one morning I was in my office there at, at, at the, at the headquarters there at Recruiting Command and Ray [Raymond Leach] called and said listen, I need--
Speaker 1: Your brother, Ray.
Speaker 2: My brother, Ray, yeah.  He said, "I need for you to come as soon as you can."  He said, "Mother just died."  And I said, "No, can't be, can't be.  How could you say such a thing?"  And he said, "Yeah."  He said, "And I need your help."  He said, "And I really need for you to come home now."  And he'd been taking care of everything from before, he said, but I really need for you to be here now.  So I said okay, I'll be there soon.  And so I went out and went home, and we got the arrangements done and everything.  And the, the thing that happened was (clears throat) she was there with my, my grandmother that lived there in the house with her.  And my, my, her brothers and sisters came in and took care of my grandmother.  And while they were taking care of my grandmother, they took care of her at the same time if she needed something.  Well, mother hadn't got up that morning, but my uncle said that he heard her take a deep breath, and he didn't hear anything else.  And so he went over to take a look at her, and she wasn't breathing.  He didn't think at that time.  So he called 911, and they came out, but they couldn't, couldn't revive her--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --by the time she--but she probably was gone when she did, you know.  That--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --probably was it at that point.
Speaker 1: And how old was she then?
Speaker 2: She was six--let me see, this was 1982, and so she was sixty-five.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, actually, she was a few month, a few weeks short of her sixty-fifth birthday 'cause she died on April 12th.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she would have been sixty-five on--she was sixty-four.  She would have been sixty-five on May the 8th.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she and Truman [President Harry S. Truman] were born on the same days.  And she used to say well, isn't it nice that he's born on my birthday?  (Laughter) I said mother, he was born before you.  But she really was very supportive of me and my career.  And I didn't know until way late in my career that she really did not want me to stay in the [U.S.] Army (laughter), but she never said a word about it--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you know, to me--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --until I was a gen- I mean no, until I was a, a colonel, 'cause she--no, no, no, I'd made colonel--yeah, she was here through colonel.  And she said you know, I thought you would have gotten out long before now.  I said ma, I had no intentions after I, after I got to, got promoted to major.  I knew I was gonna be staying for a while.  But she was really very supportive all of this time, and I miss her a lot, yeah, still.
Story_ID: 322296
Speaker 1: I want to ask you, you've done a lot of things in your lifetime, a lot of wonderful things.  And if you had your choice, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I think more than anything else I would really like to be mem- remembered, and I've had some time to think about this, as a person who cared about people and, and spent some time making sure that that was evident in what I was doing.  I have had a lot of, of real tough positions to deal with in my life.  And there were a lot of people who could have made that situation better for me or worse for me but that choose to make it better because of the way I dealt with them.  And there's an old saying that we say around the [U.S.] Army very often: if you take care of the troops, the troops will take care of you.  And I have spent a lot of time making sure that I took care of the troops.  And so I, I would love to be remembered as one of those folks who took care of soldiers, yeah, and--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --considered it important, yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, I'm sure you will be.
Story_ID: 322297
Speaker 1: And finally, let me ask you this question, and that is: the world as it is today, if you had your choice to have made anything different, is there a particular thing that you might have implemented to, to make things different?
Speaker 2: One of the things that I think would be important, couple of things.  One is I do believe that as a country, the United States of America, that we need to do a whole lot more to reach out to learn more about other peoples and who they are and where they come from.  I think that is absolutely vital for us because the world is a lot more global than it ever was before.  And I noticed that the, the president [President George Walker Bush] said last night, you know, isolationism is not an option anymore.  Well, but we have got to make sure that we look at learning about other folks and not considering that we're the only fish in the pond because we are not.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: And I just heard some [U.S.] Marine Corps general say very recently and, and, and he was so right about this.  He was talking to a group of students at the Marine Corps University [Quantico, Virginia], and he said--they were troops, of course, active duty troops and, and so on, and said, "If you do nothing else and if you learn nothing else, understand and respect the fact that there are people in this world who are as smart as we are, as Americans, and there are some people who are smarter."  And it's very important to know and understand and respect that because you can make a lot of good friends whenever you go and do that.  And, and those of us who served in the [U.S.] military have spent a lot of time trying to make some friends because it's a whole lot more fun being friendly with people than it is fighting, I'll tell you.  The infantry will tell you that first (laughter), you know what I'm saying?  The second thing is, and, and I think we need to do this for ourselves as Americans, is that we have not learned enough about how to save resources for, for our future, in terms of whatever.  That's the reason how come I couldn't sign on to, to people dealing with social security and, and, and putting it in the stock market like that, 'cause we don't know enough about saving to do that kind of stuff yet.  And we got to teach people that--and my mother [Caretha Sapp Leach] told me this very early in my life.  She said when you make money, she said save--you should send some, she says, 'cause you ought to reward yourself every now and then.  She said but learn how to save some, because you're gonna need it later, you see, at some point.  And I don't think we've done enough teaching our youngsters about finances and how important finances are.  Money is something that we have to think about every day of our lives, how you gonna get it, how you gonna keep it, if you gone save any--and I think that ought to go to the top of the list--and what you know about it.  And, and it, and it takes studying about lat- that just like it does everything else.  But those are things that, that I think is important in our world in order for us to be able to live in harmony and communion with the rest of the people and with ourselves.
Speaker 1: I agree with you 100 percent.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Thank you very--
Speaker 2: I thought about them.
Speaker 1: --very much for allowing us--
Speaker 2: Oh, this has been great.
Speaker 1: --to take all of this time--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) It's been great.
Speaker 1: --of yours.  And--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --we, we just thank you very, very much for that wonderful story and for what you've given to this country--
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: --and, and to America and to our people.  Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: It's wonderful; it's been great.  Thank you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You're a great interviewer (laughter).
