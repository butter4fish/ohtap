Speaker 2: Probably Eleuthera, in the Bahamas.  It's beautiful, the water is gorgeous.
Speaker 1: And your favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Now my mother gets after me for using this saying, but I believe it.  I have another favorite phrase or saying that I can't think of it right now, but the one that comes to mind is the one that my mother doesn't like and that's probably why it does.  It is, "Free your mind.  And your ass will follow" (laughs).  It's from, you know, the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s].  And I just think it's so true.  That once you engage in the process of thinking through visualizing something, then you can reach it.  But if you don't free your mind, then the rest of your body can't possibly go with it, and the rest of your behavior can't possibly go with it.
Story_ID: 11154
Speaker 1: Let's start with your mother.  And I'd like to have her maiden name, but I'd also like you to talk about her family, you know, what you know of her family.  And her growing up and that.
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Madeline Wheeler.  And she was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  But she grew up in Wilmington, Delaware.  And her mother was born and raised in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  And her father was from Hartford, Connecticut.  And they were from a line of African Americans who were freed earlier than most, and bought themselves out of slavery or indentured servitude.  The--my mother's family goes back to one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, Philip Livingston.  And Philip Livingston's grandson, who was also called Philip Livingston, had an affair with a slave, Barbara Williams, in upstate New York.  And Barbara Williams was from Jamaica.  And we know that they had this affair because they had a child, and on the daughter's death certificate was the name of the two parents.  And so my nephew, Christopher Rabb, started researching this genealogy based on letters and pictures.  And the daughter of this union was a very literate woman.  She's biracial of course, and she kept letters, and the letters were passed down from generation to generation.  And my mother had a trove of letters that she handed over to my nephew.  But on my mother's side, there're four--she's the fourth generation of college educated people.  And I didn't grow up eating soul food.  My mother was a great cook.  I didn't have greens until I--and black-eyed peas and chitterlings 'til I was in college.  It was just an experiment--I had heard about the food.  But my mother knew about corned beef and cabbage, and Boston baked beans, and she also grew up in an Italian neighborhood in Wilmington, Delaware.  They were segregated, but the light skin African Americans were allowed to live closer in, and they lived next to the Italians.  And so my mother, you know, learned Italian cooking.  And so she's a great Italian cook.  She's a great New England cook.  And she doesn't fry anything well.  I mean she saut√©es, and she, you know, makes great pasta and everything, but she just doesn't fry.  And I still don't know how to make fried chicken, and she taught me everything I knew.  So it was a very different environment going to--I grew up in Baltimore [Maryland], going north to see my mother's family.  Now I didn't know my mother's father, but she adored him.  She just thought the sun rose and set in him.  And he was a handsome guy.  He was head of the phys. ed. [physical education] department for the colored high school in Wilmington.  He could play the piano by ear.  He taught swimming at the rec center.  He played cards.  He drank.  He was probably the--one of the most popular people in the community.  And my mother was carrying my middle brother when he died.  And--she said, "It was a very, very difficult pregnancy" because she was so, so sad.  But I knew her mother, and her mother was a real talented woman.  She could embroider, she could sew, she could cook.  She liked the opera a lot.  And she would go and buy used clothes like--that would have a cigarette burn in it. And she'd embroider over the cigarette burn.  And she was the most stylish woman in the neighborhood. She was very vain.  Very well spoken.  And she was like a flower.  She would sit in the room, and all the men would just sort of gravitate to her.  And she apparently had a very tumultuous relationship with her husband.  And--I mean, arguing and debating issues of the day was common.  And so they were a family of arguers and screamers and fussers and, you know, the women just as well as the men. And my mother was the middle child.  She had an older sister who was very scholarly, and a younger brother who always was, you know, getting in to pranks and sort of--in the family.  And my mother was scholarly too, but when she met my dad, she'd finished two years at Temple University [Philadelphia Pennsylvania] and never went back to college.  But she got her two-year certificate.  And she met my dad when she was sixteen, and then they got married when she was twenty.  He was in the service and quite handsome from all the pictures in the military--in his uniform rather, that I saw.  And I could imagine how she was just--she would swoon.  And she was a knockout, and still is. I mean she's seventy-eight now.  But high cheekbones, green-grey eyes, wavy hair, full mouth.  She could pass for Italian when she was growing up, but she looks African American to me.  And she is also as talented as her mother.  She read music, sang in the church choir, wanted to be a singer. But her father wouldn't let her sing in nightclubs or anything like that.  So he didn't want her to be a singer.  So he made her go back to school.  But she would have loved to have been on stage.  And very well read, excellent cook, great gardener, knits so well--she no longer knits, but she knit so well that boutiques wanted to carry her creations. She designed sweaters and that sort of thing, and my sister and I still have a lot of sweaters she made.  So she's a very creative person.  In her sixties, she went back to school for art and just produced these beautiful watercolors.  Just beautiful.  Stunning.  And I always felt that she didn't go far enough in her abilities.  That there was something inside of her that held her back.  But one way she did really jump out there is that she ran for public office.  She ran for public office four times.  Lost all four times, but she ran for Constitutional Convention in Baltimore, Maryland, for city council, for state legislature and for city council again.  And she was an activist in the community.  And she had programs for unwed mothers.  And she had clothing drives.  And she just saw the stark comparison between people in our predominately African American low-income community compared to across town in the white communities.  And she just became angry. And so she became very socially involved.

Speaker 1: Now how did her--her parent--of her--you said--her parents come to live in Wilmington? How--what was the--do you know how the transition happened between Cambridge [Massachusetts] and Wilmington, Delaware?
Speaker 2: I don't.  I could find out. I don't.  I don't know.  But that was as far South as they wanted to go. That was considered going South.  And going south was dangerous.  But I think it was an employment opportunity.  For--I know it was--I know that the force was my grandfather.  But I don't know exactly why.
Speaker 1: Do you know much?  Did they ever talk about the Cambridge, Massachusetts side or--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Excuse me.
Speaker 1: You know, their family?  Or did you--?  You know, did they ever talk about much of that history?  Or, you know, aside from them, you know, sort of buying themselves out?
Speaker 2: I know that my grandmother went to Boston Latin [School, Boston, Massachusetts].  And that that was one of the finest public schools in the nation.  And her sister went to Boston Latin.  She had a sister who never married, but went from Boston Latin to Radcliffe College [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And I think she was the third African American to go to Radcliffe College, and she graduated summa cum laude.  She's Aunt Dee Dee.  And Aunt Dee Dee, I never met. But she was notorious because she was the one who insisted on education.  And my mother and her two siblings each got a trip to Europe with Aunt Dee Dee.  And it was a very--she was a very powerful force.  But she was a stereotypical spinster in the way they described--you know, a real tight, proper, you know.  And they used to have a good time pulling pranks on her to just ruffle her feathers. She was easily ruffled, you know.  She wanted everything to be just so. She believed in wearing gloves, and how a lady should present herself, and how little boys should behave.  And I understand my uncle was quite mischievous with her.  And one other thing on my father's side.  My father had a sister named Laura Wheeler Waring.  And she's a portrait painter.  And her work is in the National Gallery of Art [Washington, D.C.].  And she painted famous African Americans,  W. E. B. DuBois, James Weldon Johnson.  And she start--she taught at Cheyney State University [now Cheyney University of Pennsylvania, Cheyney, Pennsylvania] in Pennsylvania, which is very close to Wilmington, Delaware.  Right across the state line.  And I'm named after her.  The painter.  Laura Wheeler Waring.  So there's a lot of history on my mother's side of the family.
Story_ID: 11156
Speaker 1: Now I want to talk about your father's side of the family.  What do you know about that?  And, you know, you talk about how he was this very handsome person.  But what about his side of the family?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) He's a fourth generation Baltimorean. His uncle--was it his uncle?  No, his grandfather was the founder of 'The Afro American Newspaper' family--newspaper.  And the Murphys were a key part of African American life in Baltimore [Maryland] because they were the chroniclers.  They could make somebody, and they could destroy somebody because the white press didn't cover African American life.  So all the marriages, all the births, all the scandals, all the activities of W. E. B. DuBois and, you know, Marcus Garvey are all contained in the newspapers of the 'Afro American.'  And it--in their heyday, there were five newspapers up and down the eastern seaboard.  I think there was a Richmond [Virginia] edition and a New Jersey--Newark, New Jersey edition and Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] edition and Washington, D.C. edition.  So it was quite something.  So my father was the youngest of seven children.  And he was a little prince.  His father didn't work in the newspaper.  His father was a principal of one of the--it's--I can't remember whether it was a high school or elementary school.  But anyway, so he was an educator.  And my father's mother didn't have to work. Because her family, the Hughes family owned the Hughes Catering Company.  And there were five daughters.  And the Hughes Catering Company were the caterers to the carriage trade--the upscale white families of Baltimore.  And so if a white woman married down, she married a guy who wasn't from a family--good family, my father's grandfather would go to the home, sit the young man down, and teach him proper table manners.  And so my grandmother, Grace Hughes, was, you know, relatively entitled.  I mean, they had servants in their house, and when her father died, the founder of Hughes Catering Company, he gave each daughter twenty thousand dollars.  And this was during the height of the [Great] Depression.  So my grandmother always had her own money.  And would, you know, always sort of let it be known to her husband that if he didn't want to go to Maine for vacation, she could go herself. But she had these seven children.  I understand she wasn't a very warm woman.  I have really, really, really vague recollections of her.  I didn't know my grandfather.  And I think my father was her favorite.  I mean there was a house guy who drove her around and the--and his father around.  And he dragged my father around.  And he'd get into trouble.  And, you know, hanging out with the servants and all of that.  But my father never knew poverty at all.  Not close.  Not remotely.  And the house I remember as being a very, very elegant house with hardwood floors and Persian carpets.  And because he was in the catering business, he knew all about the best crystal and china.  So if you wanted to see a gorgeous table, you would just go to our grandparents' house.  And my father--do not give him a mug to drink coffee out of.  And don't give him a thick glass to drink a high ball out of or a glass of wine.  He wants the thin stuff that you, you know, you can take the spoon and go ding.
Story_ID: 11157
Speaker 1: My parents were two folks who came from relative privilege.  But he ran for office five times, and won once, which was to a citywide judge-ship.  And they were both politically active.  They were mavericks.  They did not like the Boule, or the Links, or the Cotillion.  They were 'anti' that.  They thought that black people were wastin' their time and money on clothes and cars and houses, and all these black people around them were suffering.  And he--they thumbed their noses.  So I didn't go to a Links event or anything like that until I was in my thirties. I didn't know anybody in Jack and Jill [of American Foundation, Inc.].  We lived in a low-income community.  They bought their house almost sixty years ago now.  Then they just moved out of it three years ago. So they were in that house fifty-five years.  And what happened was, it was cheap, they were poor. Dad was still in law school. Mom wasn't working. they had two children. They bought this house in the southeast section of Baltimore [Maryland].  And then the federal government came during World War II and built one of the largest federal housing projects on the eastern seaboard all around the house, which was, you know, basically swampland and undeveloped land.  And so then my father got out of law school, and the housing projects filled up with African Americans, and they needed legal advice.  So he had a law practice in the basement.  And then my mom became involved in the church with the social welfare kinds of programs.  And so they became wedded to the community.  And people loved my parents.  They just--they were so sad to see them leave the community three years ago.  They--we went to school with kids on welfare. And I'm so grateful that I had that side of my life and I didn't grow up in segregated middle class life.  And I--because I see so many black middle class people alienated from their roots.  And we can do that to our own children in this lifetime.  So I went to a segregated public school.  And then my mother said I wasn't gonna get the kind of education she thought I needed, and so she started bussing me across town.  So starting at the age of twelve, I rode an hour and a half on public transportation each way to go to junior high school and high school in the predominately Jewish community. And so I was on the bus with domestics, who were going the same route, getting ready to clean those homes.  And men who were on the morning shift at Bethlehem Steel [Company].  And I've overcome only in the last ten years my alienation toward people of my own class.  But my parents were real odd birds.  Real odd birds.
Speaker 2: I'd like to ask you about that. Why do you think that was?  What--I mean I'm trying--here she's sixteen.  You know, he's--no. She's sixteen when she meets him.They both come from privileged environments.  It would almost seem that the marriage had a--was it an arranged marriage of any sort?
Speaker 1: Well, my father had a friend in Wilmington, Delaware.  And he was single.  And he heard about the Wheelers.  And so he had a friend who introduced him to the Wheeler family, and I think he saw this girl come through the living room.  Because, you know, they couldn't stay in hotels and things during World War II, so they were always staying with friends when they were on the train.  And, you know, they--it wasn't like they could check into Hotel 6 or the Hilton.  So there was a network of people up and down the eastern seaboard.  And so I think that's how they met.
Story_ID: 11158
Speaker 1: How did their activism come about?  I mean it's not--they could have easily gone the other way.  I mean I understand--You know, but these are two people who shared a passion for activism, when they could have chose another route.  That's why I'm asking.
Speaker 2: Well part of it, I think was my grandmother.  My father's mother told my father, "William, you will go to law school."  And he was so devoted to her.  He did--he said, "Okay ma." And he was the first child of the seven children who didn't work for 'The Afro-American' newspaper.  And so I think he got to see the world.  And then he--University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland] would not accept my father because they would not accept any blacks.  They paid his way to go to Oberlin College [Oberlin, Ohio] rather than integrate University of Maryland.  And Thurgood Marshall tried to get into University Maryland law school [University of Maryland School of Law, Baltimore, Maryland] and was rejected and ended up at Howard University [School of Law, Washington, D.C.].  But because there was a lawsuit, my father was the third African American to go to University of Maryland law school.  But he couldn't join the Maryland Bar Association because it was segregated. He couldn't go to the Center Club, which was the lawyer's club, because it was segregated.  He couldn't rent office space in downtown Baltimore because that was segregated.  And he was a lieutenant in the [U.S.] Army and he couldn't--he had to ride the segregated train.  I mean so I think as a result of his mother pushing him out of Baltimore, he had a world experience that was very searing--that made him very angry.  And you can imagine, he was in this really cocooned world in Baltimore, where he was part of the elite.  And then he gets out and goes to Oberlin, and then goes to the U.S. Army, and then goes to law school, where he's basically desegregating.  And, you know, I think he had some very searing experiences.  And the other thing is that my father was close to one of his middle brothers, George B. Murphy.  And George traveled with--oh gosh!  His name is escaping me--Paul Robeson.  And George tried to organize a union at 'The Afro-American' newspaper where he worked and was fired from the newspaper by his uncle, Carl Murphy. So George was a troublemaker. And my father liked George, 'cause he was interesting and smart and fun.  Well as a result of traveling with Paul Robeson--it was during the [U.S. Senator Joseph] McCarthy era of the '50s [1950s]--George got called--George B. we called him--before the House Committee on Un-American Activities [HUAC].  And my--he asked my father to represent him.  And so he had an interview with Roy Cohn [attorney for the HUAC].  And they had a shouting match. And my father defended him. And they ended up not bringing him before the kleig lights in the open McCarthy hearings. But he was basically blacklisted, and that was another searing experience for my father.  And I was George's pet.  So all these things were happening.  And I just knew he was interesting, and he would get excited, and he traveled to East Germany and the Soviet Union with Paul Robeson.  He'd come back and he'd bring me these things from all over the world.  And he'd sit me down.  And starting at about age seven,  George would say, "Laura, have you read the paper today?"  And I'd say, "No Uncle George."  "Call me George B."  And I'd look at my dad.  And say, "Dad, can I call him George B.?"  He said, "Oh, fine."  You know. "No, George B." "So I--every time I come over, and I'll come over twice a month, I want you to have read the newspaper.  And we're going to have a discussion about world events."  And, you know, I was happy playing with my dolls and stuff.  And I knew my parents were politically active.  But, you know, that led to me reading the paper.  And then my parents started running for office.  And then, you know, rather than get a babysitter, they'd bring me out on the campaign trail. And they'd make me hand out literature. And they--I'd go door to door and say, "Would you vote for my mom?  Would you vote for my dad?"  And so my parents sort of brought me along 'cause they didn't know what else to do with me.  So they just sort of put me in the car with 'em and took me to events with them.  And then I had Uncle George who was focused in on me and didn't want me to become a silly girl who just played with dolls.  So I had all of these things going on.  And my mom in the '50s [1950s] had a miscarriage. She was at Montgomery Ward's.  And they wouldn't let her use the bathroom. Because Montgomery Ward's had segregated bathrooms.  She couldn't have children at the--any place but at the colored hospital in Baltimore.  And so she had two of my siblings at home because she refused to go to the colored hospital.  Finally she had me at Provident Hospital [Baltimore, Maryland]. There were five of us.  So they had some really searing encounters that brought them into the heart of racism. The heart of Jim Crow.  And if they'd just sort of stayed in their little cocoons, they probably would've turned out to be bourgeois black people.  Not rockin' the boat.  Educators.  Dad could have had a big job in 'The Afro American' newspaper. But they chose a different path. And as a result, their children, you know, grew up very, very differently than people expect.
Story_ID: 11159
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask you about this whole issue of passing.  Did ever those issues come up, any--?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Yes. My mother [Madeline Wheeler Murphy] growing up in Wilmington, Delaware could--did engage in passing.  You know, passing for white.  And because she was around swarthy Italians, the people in the movie theaters--which is where she passed--you know, didn't stop her.  And she had a girlfriend who could also pass.  But her older sister was dark enough to look African American--I mean she was still light-skinned, but she was dark enough to look African American.  And she couldn't pass.  And that really created a divide between the two sisters. And there were--the sisters don't speak anymore.  And I firmly believe that what started the tension was the fact that my mother could pass and my [sic. her] sister couldn't.  Because, you know, people were doing everything to get away from Jim Crow.  It was oppressive.  It was limiting.  It was hurtful.  And so at that time there was a lot of tension around who could pass and who couldn't.  But there's an interesting story.  My mother's mother had an uncle who lived in Chicago [Illinois].  And there was the Chicago fire--the Great Chicago Fire [1871].  And the family dispersed.  And they couldn't find this uncle.  And this uncle finally wrote to my grandmother and said, "You all won't see me anymore. I've decided to go on the other side."  And so he passed, and he cut every single tie he had with his family.  It was a close-knit family.  And they never heard from him again.  And they've tried to find him.  And my mother thinks she found him.  But he didn't wanna acknowledge her at all.  And wouldn't return her phone calls and all of that.  So it was a very, very painful issue on my mother's side of the family.  And we heard stories about it.  And in growing up, you know, I was teased.  My sister [Madeline Murphy Rabb] was teased, you know. "You high-yella. You think you cute. You got good hair.  You got all that stuff."  And, you know, even to this day, the vestiges of color differences and the implications of color differences are very, very powerful and painful in the African American community.
Story_ID: 11160
Speaker 1: Were there ever stories that people did well when they passed?  Or were they just sort of mediocre white people?  Did they ever--you know, were there ever acknowledgment among anybody that, you know, your parents knew or anything that did well, or--?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) As a result of passing?  I don't hear any stories about them doing any better than their middle class or upper middle class African American  counterparts.  I don't recall any stories.  But, you know, when passing--during--my mother's [Madeline Wheeler Murphy] seventy-eight now, so during her childhood passing was a way to get to things that the family couldn't get to--so you could get information. You could find out about jobs. You could go to the movies. You could go downtown and shop.  So it really--it seemed like when she was a teenager, the passing was really about non-essential issues such as shopping and going to the movies or going to the play--to a play.  And when my mother was much older, when she reached her middle years, her forties and fifties and sixties, she would whisper to my father [Judge William H. Murphy], "Well, you know, she used to pass."  And it was said with such disdain.  And I think that there--after a while, that there was a shame about passing. That it was seen as a manifestation of self-hate or denial.  And so I--you know, my mother and I had a tumultuous relationship because they say I'm so much like her, you know, hard driving, opinionated.  And I remember one time confronting her and saying, "You know, you talked about how you passed when you were a teenager. And then you talk about "Mrs. So-and-So who passes like she's a dog."  Now--well, (makes growling sound), you know.  So there's this real mixed, deep, emotion conflict underneath I think for those people who could pass but who decided to stay in the African American community.  I don't think my mother has any regrets.  And that's good.  It would be a shame if she passed, and she'd wished she'd just gone over to the other side like her uncle--her great uncle.  But she's--she became a fighter for racial justice instead.  And then, you know, during the '60s [1960s] when being black and proud was it and you were no place to be somebody--I mean, you're too light to be an authentic black person and too black to be embraced by the white community.  I mean, that was a painful period for her, and for me, because I was so identified with the Black Power movement, but, you know, light-skinned black people were not--were few and far between.  I mean there was Walter [F.] White.  I think he was the founder of the NAACP [sic. White was the executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], and Julian Bond [civil rights leader] in Atlanta [Georgia].  And--But, you know, we didn't look the part to be--for the words that were coming out of our mouths about black empowerment.  It was like, black people were kind of thrown by it and white people were kind of thrown by it.  Black people said, "Well you got it good, you know. What you worried about?  It's us dark-skinned black people who got the problems.  You ain't gonna feel no prejudice."  And they didn't know.  Yes we did. You know, my high school counselor told me to apply to Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland] and to Coppin [State University, Baltimore, Maryland].  I told her I was gonna apply to Radcliffe [College, Harvard University Cambridge, Massachusetts], Wellesley [College, Wellesley, Massachusetts] and Brown [University, Providence, Rhode Island].  She said, "You'll never get in those schools.  You need to apply to Coppin and Morgan.  And maybe you can get into Goucher [College, Baltimore, Maryland]."  And I remember gettin' my acceptances and just kind of waving them in her face.  But I mean we were steered--we were--you know, my brother and I went into a hamburger joint.  They wouldn't wait on him. He's a little darker than I am.  You know, so this--there's this myth that you're more--you're protected from the real hard bite of racism in our society if you're light-skinned. And I just don't buy it.
Story_ID: 11161
Speaker 1: When you say it was a painful period for you, you know, that whole--the '60s [1960s] period.  What specifically did you experience besides--you know, was it painful for your family?  Or was it painful for you personally?
Speaker 2: Oh for me personally. Okay, starting at seven, I was giving out campaign literature.  And then about every two years after that, one member of the family or another--not just my parents ran for office, but my two older brothers ran for office too.  And so one member of the family or the other was running for office, and I was involved in all of their campaigns.  Sometimes I'd work in the office, and sometimes I'd answer the phones, sometimes I'd go door to door.  And then when I was fifteen--it was 1970.  My father [Judge William H. Murphy] was running for citywide [Baltimore] judgeship, I think for the second or third time.  And Parren [James] Mitchell was running for [U.S.] Congress.  And there were other African Americans.  Milton Allen was running for state's attorney, which is the chief prosecutor in Baltimore [Maryland] city.  And Milton Allen's son and I formed a group called the Strike Force.  And we were a bunch of teenagers. Milton was older than I was and he could drive.  So we'd take the station wagon--we had a loud speaker in the station wagon. We'd stop on corners.  We'd have sodas, and sometimes we'd have pizzas, and we'd have t-shirts.  And we enlisted these teenagers to join the Strike Force.  And we had one of the biggest door-to-door canvassing operations in the city.  And so when I wasn't doing the Strike Force, I was sitting at the campaign headquarters because they were running on a ticket.  It was Mitchell-Allen-Murphy-Chester, you know, and all the black people were running on the ticket.  And, you know, "Single shoot" was the message.  You know, there were some offices you could vote for three people.  We said, "Just vote for the black person" and move on.  So we were telling people how to vote, we were passing out sample ballots, we were passing out campaign literature.  And this opportunity came up after the campaign was in full tilt for me to go to France.  I was doing well in French, and I applied for this summer abroad program.  And I was one of two people in my high school accepted.  And all year long I'd been doing this political activity.  I'd been, you know, cramming my homework in, and, you know, then hitting the streets.  And working on weekends for my father's campaign, and for Parren Mitchell's campaign, and for Milton Allen's campaign.  And then this trip to France came up.  And so they said, "Don't worry about the campaign.  You can work in it when you get back, you know."  So I went to Paris for--to France for six weeks.  A week in Paris, and five weeks on this--in this school that was in this resort section of Paris.  Beautiful--I would--you--it was a French immersion program.  You had to speak French, I learned how to drink French wine, I learned about French food, I--my French just improved.  And I came back to this campaign.  And I'd had this different experience.  And here I was with African Americans, you know, who had basically, you know, are low income African Americans on the Strike Force and middle income.  But, you know, none of them had traveled outside the country really.  And I sunk into the biggest depression. Because--I don't know.  It just seemed like the teasing about my light skin and curly hair was at a fever pitch.  I'd just come back from France, and I just didn't fit anywhere.  I didn't fit in my social class because my parents were alienated from people of their own social class, so I didn't have friends.  I had friends who lived in my neighborhood, who grew up in the projects, who I went to elementary school.  I had these political activist friends.  But they were saying, "Ungawa, black power," you know. And, you know, everybody who grabbed the megaphone was dark-skinned and had big afros, and I was putting vinegar on my hair to get my afro to stay up, and, you know, trying to look like Angela Davis.  And it was a really, really painful time because everybody was redefining blackness.  And black was beautiful.  And, you know, where did I fit into that spectrum?  You were either black or hatin', you know, whitey.  And talking about, "Off the pigs."  And join--you know, my brothers were joining the Black Panthers [Party].  And, you know. It was tough.  It was really tough.  And here I was, this woman--young woman trying--having these worldly experiences, wanting to see more of the world, wanting to see, you know, and having discussions with people in Europe who were not nearly as obsessed by race as Americans were. I mean--I got freedom.  I understood that there--you know, not everything revolved around race. There were Algerians, and there were Germans, and there were--you know, I met all these people.  They were interesting to talk to.  They didn't care what race I was. And then that was just like a moment of freedom where I wasn't caught up in all of this tension.  It was--and then I come back to the tension.  It was very, very, very tough.

Speaker 1: State who your siblings are and their age.  You know, just names and age.
Speaker 2: Okay.  My oldest brother is William H. Murphy, Jr., who's known as Billy Murphy, and he's fifty-seven.  He's an attorney in Baltimore [Maryland].  My sis--my next sibling is my sister Madeline Rabb, who,(comically) thank you very much is not my twin, who's fifty-five.  And she's an art consultant and jewelry designer here in Chicago [Illinois]--and a trailblazing art advocate--especially for artists of color.  My middle brother is Arthur Murphy, and he's fifty, and he's a political consultant.  He does brochures, and helps campaigns of political candidates and a fundraiser.  My next brother is Houston Murphy, and he is forty-eight, and he is a computer systems analyst.  So he comes in and assesses what your computer network needs are, and travels and trains people in computer operations.  Then there's me.
Story_ID: 11163
Speaker 1: What about family life.  What was it like?  Are there some anecdotes you'd like to share with us, you know, about growing up?  You know, that you haven't, you know, shared?  Things that influenced you.  You know, you've talked a lot about it.  But I was wondering if there are any other things you'd like to--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously)  Well there were like two sets of children.  My sister [Madeline Rabb] was almost the assistant mother.  I mean she--I was joined at the hip with her.  She got me off to school.  In elementary school, she combed my hair.  She dressed me, we shared a room a good part of my, you know, elementary school years.  But she was like big sister.  And so she and my older brother [William H. Murphy, Jr.] were like the first set of children that my mother [Madeline Wheeler Murphy] had.  Then there were five years between my sister and the next child, and so then there were the three youngest.  And the three youngest, you know, were a handful.  And we did a lot of traveling with my parents because by the time the three youngest came, my father was really in a successful law practice.  And so we were able to drive across country, and drive to Maine, and took a cruise to the Caribbean when I was twelve years old.  And my two brothers [Arthur Murphy and Houston Murphy] were really pranksters.  We had this family rule that everybody had to be at the dinner table at 6:00 [p.m.].  Dinner was at 6:00.  You could not miss dinner.  And dinner was the place where we all got to talk about our day.  And it was the time when I think my parents used to vent about--especially about issues around civil rights and justice.  And so my father [Judge William H. Murphy] would say what he did in court, and my mother would say what happened at the church.  And then they'd go down the table.  And, you know, "What did you do, Houston?"  And he says, "Well this happened in class and that." You know, and Arthur said, "Well I read this book."  And then I'd say, "Well a fight broke out on the bus."  And my father would say, "Well, who was involved?"  I said, "Well this guy and the other--another guy."  "Well what did the guy have on?"  "I don't know."  He said,  "You'd make a terrible witness in the courtroom.  How tall was he?  What color was his jacket?  You could've seen something tragic happen.  And you were right there witnessing it.  And you would've made a terrible witness."  And so, you know, every now and then each one of us would get jumped on about somethin'.  Because he--they were trying to make us responsible citizens.  And to this day, I cannot see an accident without saying, "Okay the car is this color.  And the man was standing here."  I've never been called to trial in my life.  But I'm just--you know, I'm afraid that my father would say, you know, "You know, you're not doing your civic responsibility.  You should take notes.  Did you get the license plate number?  Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera."  So I always have a pencil and piece of paper in my car.  I'm just on the prowl, right?  'Cause one day I might be called as a witness. 'Cause he would tell us about these half-ass witnesses who'd get on the witness stand.  "Well did you see?  What time of day was it?"  "I don't know." "Well what color was the car?"  "I don't know."  And he said, "Oh God."  It just breaks his heart.  So that was a--we'd get these grillings at the table, right?  The other thing that would happen in the--at the table is, you know, "Well Houston, what do you think of [U.S. President] Richard Nixon?"  "I don't know."  You know, I mean, we were like grade school.  It's not like we're college.  And they'd say, "What do you mean you don't know?"  "I don't know."  "Don't you have an opinion?"  "Well, no."  "Children with no opinions."  You know--and so, we were not allowed to be silent.  We were not allowed to misuse the English language.  We were not allowed to pass on talking about political conversations.  We had to participate.  It was mandatory participation at the dinner table.  So the things I remember about my childhood are dinners, of course. Traveling, sitting around the--with the family watching TV.  My father loved 'Rocky and Bullwinkle' [television cartoon program].  He would come home 5:00 [p.m.] just to make sure he could watch 'Rocky and Bullwinkle' cartoons.  And so there was this soft side of him. But he wasn't the kind of guy that took you to the games or took you to the movies, or--he was very tight.  So he wouldn't do that.  And then I remember my mother singing at the piano.  And the garden, which I hated growing up, and now I love gardening.
Story_ID: 11164
Speaker 1: Do you remember any trips?  Any one trip that had, you know, impact on you?  You know, younger than the ones you grew up with.  Any other--?
Speaker 2: My father's [Judge William H. Murphy] older sister was a nun.  And she's still living--she's ninety-four.  And she basically ran away from Baltimore [Maryland].  My father was Episcopalian, and the Episcopalian Diocese was not accepting black women to become nuns.  So she had to go to Canada.  So she has lived there ever since she was, oh, I think eighteen--or in her twenties, or some ridiculous--all of her life practically.  And I remember going to Canada to visit her and watching all these nuns come out with these long black habits.  And she was more animated, and she'd yank up her--there's something it's called robe or whatever--there's a habit--and jump on a bicycle and pedal off.  And I just--I remember that.  I remember going seeing her.  And how different it was to be in that cloistered environment.  And she ministered to senior citizens--she was a character.  And then I remember driving across country with my three--my two older brothers [Arthur and Houston Murphy] to pick up my sister [Madeline Rabb], who was at a religious retreat in Lake Tahoe.  And I remember the boring cornfields of Iowa and Kansas.  And then the beautiful, beautiful Rockies [Mountains].  And we would drive around the Rockies, and at that time, a lot of the roads didn't have guardrails, and you know how huge the Rockies are.  And so to frighten my mother [Madeline Wheeler Murphy], we would lean to the side of the car like we were leaning toward the cliff.  And she'd say, "Stop it!  Stop it!  Stop it!"  And we had a great time.  We sang songs, we played car games like license plates games.  I can't even remember.  And we saw Mount Rushmore.  And we saw Old Faithful in Yosemite [sic, Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming].  And we saw redwoods.  And they were--my parents were big lovers of scenery.  So they would just get to a beautiful lake when we got to Lake Tahoe [California/Nevada], and they would just look like they were gonna cry, it was just so beautiful to them.  And so we're always into the scenery.  The leaves changing, the dogwoods in spring, the beautiful snowcaps--and it's funny, because I have an eleven year old son [Bertram M. Lee, Jr.]--and I've inherited this love of nature from my parents. And when he was eight, we went out one fall for a ride in the leaves.  And he said, "Mommy, isn't this magnificent?"  And I just laughed.  Because it means it's just been passed down from generation to generation (laughs).  So I remember that love of beautiful scenery.

Speaker 1: Tell me what you were like as a--you know, what kind of child were you?  Were you quiet and shy?  Were you, you know, were you bratty?  Were you precocious?  Were you--I mean what kind of--you know, what kind of person were you as a young?
Speaker 2: Now you really expect me to be objective?  About what kind of child I was?
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) Well, you know, how would you describe yourself in some respects?  You know, 'cause we all--were you--but you--were you introspective?  Were you thinking?  Were you--you were the youngest.
Speaker 2: I was the youngest.  And as a result of living in a pretty rough neighborhood, my two older brothers--I have three older brothers.  But the ones closest to me [Arthur and Houston Murphy] could go out, and they could go in other people's houses, and they could take--we had a dog.  They could take the dog with them, they could go exploring.  And I was house bound as a child, because my mother [Madeline Wheeler Murphy] didn't want anything to happen to me.  You know, according to her, I was very pretty, and, you know, I had all these curly ringlets and freckles.  And I was just, you know. She felt very protective of me.  And by that time, we had a housekeeper, so I'd have to stay home with Ms. Brown, the housekeeper, who was about four feet high and four feet wide.  And so I played with my dolls a lot.  I was a loner.  And I'd so wanna go out with my brother, Houston, who's three years older.  And he was so mischievous.  I mean, he used to do things like bury my Barbie dolls in dirt up to their neck, and so--I had to be tough, because my brothers could gang up on me.  So I developed a mouth early, and I was a fighter, because it was either fight or get beaten up.  And I didn't have any girlfriends to--you know, I didn't have like a clique of girls who could counteract my two brothers picking on me.  And I was a really good student, and I liked to read, and I was very opinionated.  See, I had watched my father [Judge William H. Murphy] and mother drill all these older--my older sister [Madeline Rabb] and brother [William H. Murphy, Jr.].  So I knew by the time I came along, I said, "Uh-uh, they ain't beating up on me."  So I had opinions.  I had, you know. So I'd talk even when I wouldn't know what I was talking about.  I was just, you know, I'd just talk about everything.  And I was--so I was an old child.  And I had this Uncle George B. [Murphy] who was pressuring me to have opinions and read.  So I was very opinionated.  And when I became a teenager,  I really started not getting along with my mother.  She had cowed the other children--they were afraid of her.  And I was the only kid she couldn't cow, 'cause I watched her like a hawk. See, the problem was, I adored my mother.  I mean I remember standing in the kitchen and if she backed up, she'd step on me.  I would follow her around the house.  I'd follow my sister around the house.  You know, they were my playmates in essence, you know.  And they were the only people I could talk to.  And so then as I became a teenager, I saw the cracks in my mother's armor, and so I became probably more critical of her.  But it was because I adored her.  And I--there was so much in me it--that was her, that I could give it back to her.  And she just wasn't used to this.  You know, the boys just kind of kept out of her way.  And so I left a year early from high school.  I left when I was sixteen.  I didn't finish the twelfth grade. They had an early admissions program at Wellesley [College, Wellesley, Massachussets]. And it was time for me to get out of the house, 'cause it was just too contentious. But it--you know, I think I was--my brother-in-law says I was just adorable, but I would just talk his ear off. He said--you know, he said, "Well, where'd this kid get all these big words?"  And I'd be right up there fighting with the adults over issues.  So, I was an old soul.

Speaker 1: You went to elementary school where?
Speaker 2: In Cherry Hill.  Cherry Hill Elementary School 159 [Baltimore, Maryland] it was called. It was about three blocks--four--three long blocks from the house. And then I went to Pimlico Junior High School [Pimlico Middle School, Baltimore, Maryland]. Which was ten miles on the other side of town.  And then I went to Northwestern High School [Baltimore, Maryland].  So my entire elementary and secondary education was public schools.
Speaker 1: Now when you went to--when you were bussed, was there a--that was a new experience, right?  I mean you weren't bussed.  I'm sorry.  You know, rode the--as you went to school.
Speaker 2: My mother went down to the Board of Education and raised hell.  And said, "You will admit my daughter."  And so they were forced to accept me in what, you know, were neighborhood schools.
Story_ID: 11167
Speaker 1: And what did that--what kind of experience was that with you?  It took you out of your community.  But were there any interesting insights or experiences you learned from, you know, that?
Speaker 2: Well--I realized that I had inferior equipment in my school.  That the books that I had in elementary school were beat-up books. And at the predominantly Jewish junior high school, things were newer and brighter and cleaner.  And I was one of two blacks in my seventh grade class and one of--one black in my--I was one black in my eighth grade class. The only black.  And then in the ninth grade, I went to Northwestern High School [Baltimore, Maryland], and there were more blacks there because the city had begun to integrate a little better.  So, I really was immersed in the Jewish culture.  A lot of the kids went to Hebrew school after finishing junior high school.  And so I learned Yiddish words. I ate occasionally, you know, Jewish food like matzoh. And I learned what gefilte fish was and all this other stuff.  But I was never invited home.  You know, when--even if I developed a friendship. But it was just unrelenting hostility toward me in seventh grade.  And it was the first time I'd gotten a C on anything.  And it was a very lonely experience in seventh and eighth grade.  I remember feeling lonely. And I'd come home and tell my parents, you know, what they would say to me, the mean things and what they would do.  And, nobody wanted to be my friend.  And they just said, "Well you just have to buck up and fight."  And around that time, my parents sat me down and said, "You know, you're the youngest of five.  We're politically active.  We're not gonna do PTA [Parent Teacher Association] anymore.  And we'll come there if you're really in trouble. But we expect you to learn how to fight your own battles."  And that was a very chilling experience for me.  It was like gee whiz, you know. God, I really have to do this.  And something--I think they saw something in me.  I don't think they did that with my brother who was three years older.  I think they saw something in me that said, you know, this girl is gonna be alright.  I didn't know it at the time and I was scared.  But, in the eight grade, I refused to say the Pledge of Allegiance.  You know, you're supposed to stand, put your hand over your heart, say the Pledge of Allegiance.  And my homeroom teacher put me out, and sent me to the vice principal's office.  The vice principal was the enforcer.  And he happened to be an African American man.  And he says, "Young lady, you will get suspended."  And I said, "You can suspend me, but I'll call a lawyer."  And I don't think he ever--I didn't know where I got that from.  Nobody instructed me to do that and I didn't even ask my parents permission, if I couldn't say the Pledge of Allegiance.  So he said, "Do you know that it's not patriotic to, to refuse to say the Pledge of Allegiance?"  And I said, "Well, America is doing all these terrible things to black people, and we don't have civil rights. And I'm going to this all prejudice school. And, you know, Pledge of Allegiance doesn't mean anything to me, and I'm not saying it.  And you can put me out. But I'm gonna get a lawyer."  Nobody at my house knew that I was doing this.  And so I was really scared.  I was like, "Oh, God! Laura, I know you've crossed the line now. And you're gonna have to tell Mom and Dad." So I went home. And at dinnertime, "Mom, Dad I got sent to the principal's office--the vice principal's office today." And they said, "For what!"  And they said--well they said I was misbehaving.  "Well what did you do?" And I said, "I refused to say the Pledge of Allegiance."  "Well what did he say to you?"  And I told him that I would call a lawyer and that I had a constitutional right not to say the Pledge of Allegiance.  And they said, "We're so proud of you."  And it was like, wow!  You know?  "We're so proud of you."  And then, you know, from that point on, I was hell on wheels.  You know, I was in student government, petitioning, writing things for the student newspaper.  And, you know, that was my turning point.  And, you know, that was my--the point where I said, "You know, you don't have to take it."  I was just bitter.  I was bitter about that junior high school experience.  I was bitter about the alienation.  I was bitter that they didn't care what any African American did in history. And I had all this African American history in my family, and we didn't exist in my textbooks.  And I was just--you know, I wasn't gonna sit there and quietly be mad.  I was gonna let somebody know that I didn't appreciate it.  And that was my way of protesting.  You know, in the meantime, people were rioting in the streets, you know.  It was pretty mild in the context of things.  But it was pretty radical for my peers.  They weren't involved in the politics of the day.  They could care less. They were painting their fingernails and flirting with guys and, you know.  And then when I went to high school, all I wore was jeans and T-shirts and jeans and T-shirts.  And I had my Angela Davis like afro. And I, you know, you know, I was in the--this--the hippie garb, you know?  And I had a lot more friends in high school.  I liked high school.  And I did something really counterrevolutionary. It was that I was nominated for the queen's court.  So I was like the ninth grade prom queen or something. And I--you know, I was ashamed to tell people, (laughs).  You know, who I knew like who were--would do campaign work with me.  But it was like, "Oh!"  And I remember when I had to get my picture taken I wore a dress.  And the guys in the class applauded 'cause they had never seen my legs before. And that was just like--that was sort of a discovery--oh God!  I'm a girl,  you know,  you know, I'm not just this activist.  There are other parts of me.  And--but that was it.  I dropped that after ninth grade.  It was straight back to the revolution and, you know.  But I did go to my proms. And I did--but I sewed my prom clothes.  I liked sewing.  And--.
Story_ID: 11168
Speaker 1: So Northwestern High school, was it--was it mixed?
Speaker 2: Coed.
Speaker 1: Coed.
Speaker 2: --And integrated.  More integrated than Pimlico
Speaker 1: Jewish then?
Speaker 2: Yes. Jewish.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, you know, the thing was, I was in--at Pimlico [Junior High School, Baltimore, Maryland] and at Northwestern [High School, Baltimore, Maryland] I was in college prep[eratory] AP [advanced placement] track.  And that's where the segregation comes.  Because you can be in a totally integrated high school but those AP classes, are still, in many communities, whites-only kind of deals.
Speaker 1: Now did you--what were your favorite subjects during that time?  I know you were involved, you know, with a lot of student activities but what were your favorite subjects?
Speaker 2: Social studies and chemistry.
Story_ID: 11169
Speaker 1: You applied, you know, to a variety of schools and you got into Wellesley [College, Wellesley, Massachusetts].  So what was that whole experience, you know, like?  And you said you graduated at--you--,
Speaker 2: Left high school [Northwestern High School, Baltimore, Maryland] at sixteen.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Left high school--.  Now when--well, so when you left high school, did you graduate high school?  Or you--.
Speaker 2: Well the program was--if you took enough advanced placement courses by the end of your junior year, you had mostly electives left in your senior year.  Except you were supposed to take seniors english.  So if you went to college and took college-level english, they would give you credit for that.  And so at the end of your freshman year in college, you would get your diploma in the mail.  So I didn't march with my classmates.  I left.
Speaker 1: So [laughing] okay.  So when you show--okay--so you--what made you decide Wellesley? I mean on Wellesley as the place to go?
Speaker 2: (Laughs)  Well Radcliffe [College, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] put me on--well my--brother Arthur, my middle brother--my parents at that point, they couldn't tell me anything.  We weren't getting along that well.  So, they wanted me to get a really good education.  And since my mother's aunt had gone to Radcliffe, they thought I should apply to Radcliffe. But--Brown [University, Providence, Rhode Island], Wellesley and Radcliffe.  And my brother drove me to those schools on a spring break or winter break.  And I actually had interviews at those schools.  So I was able to see the campuses.  And my mother, when it came time to get the acceptances, became kind of agitated.  She was concerned that if I went to Radcliffe, I'd turn out to be a spinster like her aunt.  And she wanted her daughters to get married.  In the interview at Radcliffe was very--the woman was so full of herself.  So Wellesley accepted me outright, Brown accepted me outright.  And Radcliffe put me on the waiting list.  And then Radcliffe called me and said, "You're accepted." And by that time, I didn't like gritty, grimy Cambridge, Massachusetts.  And then my mom had influenced me that Radcliffe--you know, I think she felt that there might be too many [whispers] lesbians at Radcliffe, you know, I could turn out to be a lesbian or a spinster.  And so [laughs].  And Wellesley had this beautiful campus on a lake, on rolling hills, fourteen miles west of Boston [Massachusetts]. And it was just gorgeous.  And since I'd grown up appreciating nature, this beautiful green and tree-lined and this lake and these beautiful gothic buildings. So that had a big influence on me, the way the campus looked.  And Brown was in a grimy kind of environment too.  So Wellesley seemed to get agreement all around.  So that's--so that's how I chose it.
Story_ID: 11170
Speaker 1: What was that experience [at Wellesley  College, Wellesley, Massachusetts] like?  How--what was your maturation process?  And, you know, you're--are you younger than most people coming in at that time?
Speaker 2: Oh, definitely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A lot of the people are two years older than I am.  You know, a lot of the girls are eighteen.  They've dated, they've written more term papers.  You know, the one thing about missing senior year is that, I could have learned how to write more.  A lot of them--a lot of the white women went to elite private schools, Swiss boarding schools.  The African American women--generally were older and just--they just seemed socially to be much smoother than I was.  And I would think long and hard before I let my child do what I did.  It was--it was a rough social adjustment.  And academically it just kicked my butt the first two years.  The second year, I decided to live off campus at a house called A Better Chance.  You know, there's a program called Better Chance that puts high school students in different environments, prep schools.  So they were a group of girls mainly from New York who were living in this house, attending Wellesley High School [Wellesley, Massachusetts] which was one of the best public high schools in the country.  And I was like an in-house resident advisor.  There were house parents and I was supposed to be the [unclear]. And you know what, I was barely older than most of the girls in those houses--in that house rather.  And so I lived off campus. And I was into this, you know.  This was part of my giving back to the community. 'Cause I felt the--a lot of the Wellesley girls, they wanted to be--the black ones wanted to be Deltas [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.] and wanted, you know.  And the white ones weren't having any part of black people anyway.  So I didn't really fit in,  I didn't think.  So I lived off campus. And I remember the dean calling me after the end of my first semester. And said, "You know, you need to make up your mind whether or not you want an education or you want a life experience.  And if your grades continue to go this way, we're gonna have to put you out of the school."  So then I moved back on campus and became involved in the black student organization Ethos.  And then my junior year, I became president of Ethos.  And we had a huge demonstration about a number of issues on the campus. And we were successful in a lot of our advocacy efforts.  My grades went up.  I finally felt like I was a real Seven Sister student. You know, by the time I graduated, I was at As and Bs.  But it was--man it was painful and it was so competitive.  I wasn't used to the vicious competitiveness of that environment.  But I think it was good that I went to a women's school because I saw women, you know, presidents of the school, heads of departments, you know, there wasn't anything a woman couldn't do. And I wasn't distracted by, you know, constantly trying to look cute for a guy in class.  We came to class, we looked like hell, but we hit the books or we did whatever. But we weren't dominated by what guys thought.
Speaker 1: Now how was that whole Boston [Massachusetts] experience?  Was it liberating in many ways?  Or did you, you know, what sort of formulated you?  And then what were your thoughts?  Well that--asked that question--answered that question [unclear].
Speaker 2: We had a exchange program with MIT. And so I ended up taking a couple of courses at MIT.  And the MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] bus was like a free ride into Cambridge. So we could party with people from Simmons [College, Boston, Massachusetts] and Tufts [University, Medford, Massachusetts] and BU [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts] and Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And then I had a very good friend, childhood friend, who was at Dartmouth [College, Hanover, New Hampshire]. So I'd get in a car and ride up to Dartmouth to see her.  It was great.  It was very liberating.  I never wanted to go home after that.

Speaker 1: When you graduated [Wellesley College, Wellesley, Massachusetts] you actually went to work for [U.S. Congressman] Parren Mitchell, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And this was in--because you had worked in that one campaign [unclear]--.
Speaker 2: Well actually, I worked for him between my junior and senior year at--of college.  I nagged him and said, "I want an internship." so I got an LBJ [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] [Congressional] internship.  And then after my senior--after that internship, at the beginning of my senior year in college, he said, "You know, you did a great job.  I want you to come back and work fulltime."  So I was set senior year.  I had a job.  And I did not have to go home.  And school was so grueling, I didn't want to go to graduate school right away anyway.  So I had this job as a legislative assistant on Capitol Hill [Washington, D.C.].  And I was twenty when I got out.  So--.
Speaker 1: A wonderful experience.
Speaker 2: It was a great--It was a life-changing experience.
Speaker 1: So tell me why it was.
Speaker 2: Well you saw how the laws were made.  You, you know, I saw [U.S. Senator Edward] Ed Brooke debate an issue in the well of the Senate.  Oh gosh, there were these--Parren Mitchell was putting through minority business enterprise programs.  And then you had [U.S. Congresswoman] Shirley Chisholm, and you had, oh gosh--[U.S. Congressman Charles] Charlie Rangel and [U.S. Congressman] John Conyers.  These were real fighters. I mean [with emphasis] these were the real champions of civil rights. and it was just wonderful.  Absolutely wonderful to be around them and to be in the corridors of power.  And then you also saw men that--and women that you'd seen on TV and they'd be drunk or they'd be chasing their secretaries around the desk.  I mean you saw lobbyists who were sleazy.  I mean you just--because I--you know, in that environment, twenty years old, young woman, you're a nobody and so you can just become the wallpaper and just see everything and it was fabulous.
Story_ID: 11172
Speaker 1: How would you describe [U.S. Congressman] Parren Mitchell?  And, you know, how would you describe him and your experience with him?  But as a person or as a legislature--legislator?
Speaker 2: Just one of the best human beings in the world.  I mean very focused, dedicated to all people.  But especially dedicated to righting the wrongs for black people.  I mean I tear up thinking about him.  He was just a warm, wonderful person.  He had a wry sense of humor.  He called me a devil.  He'd say, "You devil.  You're just a little devil aren't you? You're just pushing me, you're trying to get me to introduce this bill.  Just a little devil."  I mean he had these little pet names for me and he was very warm.  And, you know, he's one of these guys when he'd walk in the room, the Capitol Hill [Washington, D.C.] police guards who--you know, the black ones would try to get in the room to see what he was gonna say at the press conference.  Or the--the black cafeteria workers would come in.  Because they knew something was gonna go down and he was gonna to be so articulate and they would be so proud.  And they'd--you could hear them talking in the corridors, "Parren Mitchell is gonna--he's gonna call a hearing about that.  Parren Mitchell is going to introduce a bill."  And he'd fight on behalf of the low-paid workers and so the secretaries, the police officers, the janitors, the cafeteria workers, they loved him because he spoke.  Now some of our black elected officials who shall remain nameless, some of it went to their head.  Parren was a regular guy.  "Hey, how you doing? How's your family? How's your--."  You know,  people would come into his office from all over the country because they had been wronged and because they would see him on TV or read about him or hear about him on the radio and make--they knew that this guy cared.  They're just--and he was so poised in the face of such racism in the Congress.  I mean, they would do things like when [U.S. Congressman Ronald] Ron [V.] Dellums  came--got elected from California and he got on the Armed Services Committee as a peace activist. They made sure he didn't have a chair to sit in.  That's how they showed their disdain for members of the [Congressional] Black Caucus.  So on the outside, people thought, "These black folks have arrived.  They're in Congress."  On the inside, they'd do mean things.  They would fail to write up their remarks in the committee.  And everybody else's remarks were part of the printed record.  They would ask--Parren Mitchell would ask to have certain witnesses at the hearing.  They would ignore his request.  I mean the slights and indignities that this man endured and he fought on.  And he fought with such elegance and poise.  And, you know, he had to just go home some nights and want to throw the bookcase on the floor he was so angry.  But he had to keep giving people, poor people, working women who weren't getting minimum wage or, you know, were being abused, black people, Hispanic people.  He knew that he represented hope to them.  So he didn't cry in his milk.  He didn't say, "Poor me, poor me, poor me."  Very classy, dignified guy.  But, he did not believe in paying women the same rate that they--he paid men.  And I'd say--and I found out I was being paid much less than somebody who was doing the same job in the office.  And I said, "Congressman Mitchell, you know, why do you do this?"  And he said, "Well men have to support their families and there aren't a lot of opportunities for black men."  And I said, "But it's the same work for really different pay."  And he says, "Well I understand and but that's my--."  And he was very principled and up front about it.  But I said to myself, "To heck with that."  And then somebody called me from [U.S. Congresswoman] Shirley Chisholm's office.  And so I left Parren Mitchell's office after a year.  And she believed in promoting women and paying women.  And, you know it's the beginning of the feminist movement.  So, Shirley Chisholm was happening for me because she embraced young women and just gave them positions of responsibility.  That we--you know, we didn't get all the same shots in Parren's office.  The men would get to go with him to events and the men would get to, you know, have the cushy kinds of prominent assignments.  While in Shirley Chisholm's, you know, she was liberating women left and right.
Story_ID: 11173
Speaker 1: And how would you describe her too [U.S. Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm] as a legislator?  I mean, she has such a kind, you know, kind demeanor.  That's what you think of her as.  And that's different from, let's say somebody like Barbara--,
Speaker 2: Jordan [U.S. Congresswoman Barbara Jordan]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, Shirley Chisholm always had her makeup on and she wore wigs and she always had matching suits with matching purses and shoes and sometimes hats.  And she was a prim little lady.  I mean she was probably a size four.  Okay?  And she was very girlish, you know, the way she'd walk and the way she'd powder her nose.  But don't get her started.  She was one of the best orators in the [U.S.] House of Representatives.  She could pound the table.  She could make a point.  I mean she did things like--the [U.S.] Department of Health and Welfare it was called at that time, the HEW, health, education and welfare was sterilizing mainly black women in mental institutions, allowing the states to do this so that the caretakers would not impregnate them.  A lot of these women ended up in mental institutions because they were abandoned by their family, or they were poor, or they were illiterate.  Not necessarily because they had mental illnesses.  If they got treatment, they could get out, and they could start their own families and go to work and that sort of thing.  But just routinely, black women were being sterilized.  She just raised hell about that.  She raised heck on behalf of domestic workers.  She was a big proponent of the Equal Rights Amendment.  Oh, she was into equal pay for work of comparable value.  She was a real fighter.  And she wanted to be on committees that related to her Brooklyn [New York, New York] district.  But they decided to put her on agriculture to snub her.  And so she got on agriculture.  And who runs food stamps but the [U.S.] Department of Agriculture.  So she became a legend in expanding the food stamp program.  So she fixed them.  I mean she was a person who turned lemons into lemonade like [U.S. Congressman] Parren [Mitchell].  But the thing that really tickled me about her is that a lot of black men would accuse her of not being pretty.  You know, they would talk--Redd Foxx had a joke about Shirley Chisholm.  It was a very disparaging joke. It made me very angry.  But when you were in, in her presence, she was a femme fatale. I mean she could flutter those lashes and giggle and the guys would tell her everything in [U.S.] Congress.  They would give her their socks.  But she knew who was having affairs.  She knew what marriages were breaking up, who had a drinking problem, who was frustrated politically.  And so she could play these guys and get her legislation through.  And so she used her feminine wiles.  And she was still a feminist!  But she wasn't a bra burning, Betty Friedan kind of feminist.  She was a black lady in the truest sense of the word.  I mean she--you could tell her a dirty joke and oh, God!  She'd giggle like--I mean she'd put her hand over her mouth and she'd just,  "Oh!" (covers her face with her hands) you know and get flustered and blushed like a schoolgirl.  And--But then she would figure out what that legislator needed and how to pat that ego and get her work done.  She was very shrewd.  And she was one of the women who taught me that, you don't have to lose your femininity to be tough.  And so she was a great role model, great role model.
Speaker 1: And you worked for her how long? How many years?
Speaker 2: Two years.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Two years.
Story_ID: 11174
Speaker 1: I was recruited by the ACLU [the American Civil Liberties Union].  They wanted to integrate their ranks.  They were an all-white shop.  They had hired one black guy prior to me.  But they'd never had anybody, anybody else black in their office.  And so the guy who was the legislative director for the Congressional Black Caucus referred my name to them.  So they called me up.  I interviewed for the job and I was ready to get out.  Because you are confined by the politics if you're a member of Congress.  And so I was hired to do women's rights and civil rights.
Story_ID: 11175
Speaker 1: You spent time on the [Capitol] Hill [Washington, D.C.].  You know your way around the Hill.  So in many ways, you know, you're not like a rookie coming in.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So what was that whole experience, you know, like?  And I know that you went from a [Washington] D.C. office and you went to L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  But, you know, can you just sort of talk about that?  You--from 1979 to 1982 you were still in Washington?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Well, I was there for the transition from the [U.S. President James] Carter years to the [U.S. President Ronald] Reagan years.  'Cause Reagan was elected in 1980.  And during the Carter years part of my tenure there, we were trying to get the Equal Rights Amendment ratified in the states.  And we were trying to get [U.S.] Congress to pay more attention to women's issues.  And we were trying to get the Carter administration to crack down on private schools that were formed to avoid desegregation orders, mainly in the South.  They were getting tax benefits from the federal government and we wanted the federal government to deny their tax status because they were, you know, all white schools set up to avoid desegregation.  And so there was a lot going on.  We were trying to get the Fair Housing Law with some teeth in it--so, really weighty issues.  And then Reagan got elected, and the whole dynamic changed.  He was a champion of the religious right and the far right.  And [Rev.] Jerry Falwell and everybody else came in, and the ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union] was their favorite target.  And one of the issues that I had to work on was the extension of the Voting Rights Act.  The Voting Rights Act of 1965 expired in 1982.  And my boss, John Shaddick, a very, very nice, smart white guy said, "Laura, I'm gonna give you this Voting Rights Act extension task.  But I don't really hold much hope for it because we're in Reagan years."  And I think the [U.S.] Senate had turned Republican.  And [U.S. Senator Robert] Bob Dole was the majority leader.  And that was the first time it happened in years.  And so there was a whole new regime of power.  And I said, "Well, I'm gonna take on the Voting Rights Act extension, and I'm gonna take it on as if we're gonna win it.  'Cause I don't believe in doing things you can't do."  So he said, "Yeah, but don't get your hopes up." And I said, "Okay, fine." So we formed a coalition with the [NAACP, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] Legal Defense Fund and the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund, and all these other groups.  And the chief lobbyist in Washington for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund was Elaine Jones.  And her chief lawyer was Lani Guinier.  And then Antonio Hernandez was head of the Washington bureau for the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund.  And this young guy named Ralph Neece had just come on as head of the Civil Rights Coalition and Leadership Conference in Civil Rights.  And we were all just sort of just trying to figure out how to do this.  And we did it. We got Reagan to pass--to sign into law a Voting Rights Act extension.  And--I mean thing--people think things are terrible in Florida, and they are--and here in Illinois, around November 2000 [Presidential] elections--but they would've been far worse had there been no Voting Rights Act extension.  So, you know, what it showed me was that liberal Democrats are not always liberal.  They don't always have the courage of their convictions, and you can work with Republicans to get certain things done.  And at that time, Bob Dole was quite a moderate.  And we could not have gotten the extension passed without Bob Dole's help.  And so I have letters of commendation from [U.S.] Senator [Edward] Kennedy and  Bob Dole.  And I've got Reagan's signature the day that the Voting Rights Act was signed into law; and [U.S. President] George [H.W.] Bush, the elder, signature.  And it was just a wonderful experience.  And so I've maintained friendships with people who also ascended to, you know, different positions.
Story_ID: 11176
Speaker 1: Why do you think you were successful?  Why--you're--all of you were relatively young still at that point in your careers.
Speaker 2: Younger. (laughs)
Speaker 1: Younger.  I mean, but you were young--I mean, you were--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) I was, yeah, in my mid-twenties.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Right.
Speaker 2: I think Elaine [Jones] and Lani [Guinier] were at least ten years older than--so I was probably the youngest.  And there were about seven of us who--this was our mission to get the Voting Rights Act extended.  We really targeted the papers, and so we got good editorials out of newspapers.  We really did a great job in developing the hearing record.  We had people come from the South who talked about how in 1980 the polling places were changed at the last minute in all the black neighborhoods, how the machines were malfunctioning, how blacks were purged from the voter rolls and all this other stuff.  So we had wonderful witnesses.  And I remember one particular witness--so we all took tasks in trying to bring witnesses, like I took Virginia, and somebody else took Georgia, and all these states that had been particularly covered by the Voting Rights Act.  We all decided to go back to those states, find out if there were still voting problems.  And there were boatloads of voting problems around race.  And so I had to go to Virginia.  And I--you know, I had to ask around to find out who was, you know, the best spokesperson for political issues.  And it turned out to be this state senator named Doug Wilder. So I called Doug Wilder and asked him if he would be willing to testify. And he said, "Yes."  But he didn't have time to write testimony.  But he certainly could give 'em book, line and verse about the voting problems. So I wrote his testimony.  I sent it down to him.  And he sent it back all marked up.  Then I asked him if he would come to Washington [D.C.] sometime to meet.  So I took--brought him to the ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union].  We talked about the points. And, you know, I prepped him for the hearing.  And man, he got in that hearing and he turned it out--all the egregious voting violations that were going on in the state of Virginia.  And he could cite things on the record.  Where people would say that they, you know, "The Negroes shouldn't have a say in this election."  I mean he could cite newspaper articles and things that were said in the [Virginia] state senate.  And he was fabulous.  And that was one of the turning points that we--and we were able to get the media interested.  So some of this was covered on--a lot of this was covered on black radio.  And so there was this huge push.  We got [Rev.] Jesse Jackson, got Vernon Jordan.  We had--you know, all of the who's who of black leadership come in and pound the table.  And we got the Hispanic groups in there, and they came in. So it was great.  It was just great.  It was a real public relations coordinated lobbying.  We had target lists.  And one of the few things that the others wouldn't do, that I did, was I decided that I was gonna meet with all those Republicans and find out what their objections were. And so I ended up getting a meeting with a little known [U.S.] Congressman named Henry Hyde.  And we had the best conversation.  He said, "Well if you can prove to me--." I said, "Congressman, we will prove it to you."  And Henry Hyde and I are good friends to this day, because nobody had ever come talked to him.  And what that experience showed me is that we live in these camps and we don't talk to each other.  That segregation extends way up.  And the Democrats don't talk to the Republicans, the civil rights groups don't talk to the Republicans.  The Republicans are out there just hearing from their own sources.  And we need to go in there and get in their faces and say, "Hey, we've got a problem here.  It's a national problem.  It's a denial of equal justice. And this can go on in America, how can you go to China and say they shouldn't have those policies? Or how can you go--send observers in South Africa.  And--what--you know, come on."  And so we were able to pull some Republican votes.  And I'd like to think that that was one of my major contributions. But you had the best brainpower in the land. I mean Elaine Jones and Lani Guinier and Antonio Hernandez.  Oh!  It was great.  It was absolutely great.
Story_ID: 11177
Speaker 1: You go to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] to be director of planned development in a foundation.  So that's a different type of thing.
Speaker 2: Well what happened was, by this time my father [Judge William H. Murphy] had really, really, really put pressure on me to go to law school. And he said, "Come back to Baltimore [Maryland] and you can go to the University of Maryland law school [University of Maryland School of Law, Baltimore, Maryland] and I'll pay for it."  And I just could not imagine going back home and living in that house and dealing with parents, you know. Who didn't want to realize that their baby had grown.  So no way was I going to the University of Maryland.  So I finally applied to Georgetown law school [Georgetown University Law Center, Washington, D.C.]. And I got accepted in the spring of 1982.  In the meantime, I had dated this guy [John A. Miner, III], you know, in '79 [1979] and '80 [1980]. And we broke up and he moved to California.  And all of a sudden he started calling me again. And, "You know, come on, why don't we get back together?"  And the other pressure that my father was putting on me was either go to law school or get married.  He couldn't stand the fact that I was living alone on Capitol Hill and, you know. All the crime on Capitol Hill in Washington--it just made him crazy.  He would--I mean, "Get married. Come home. Do something."  And I wasn't thinking about it. So I didn't really want to go to night school.  I--my job was a twelve hour a day job and I had to have some fun.  And I didn't want to become a workaholic.  In the meantime, this old boyfriend calls me up and says, "Come and see me in California."  Well, I go to California, and I kind of miss him. And he--we had a good relationship. And I just didn't think he was serious at the time. So I broke up with him a year before.  So he calls me and he says, "Come on and come visit me."  He used to work for [U.S.] Senator [Edward] Kennedy on the [Senate] Judiciary Committee. And he moved back to California where he's from.  And so I go out there, and the guy proposes to me. And I didn't have any other prospects, my dad was on my case, California seemed really great. So I marry and I move out there to Los Angeles.  So I'm looking for a job.  The first person who offers me a job is the ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union] out there.  And one of the things that I wanted to do in my career as a result of having four elections in--fourteen elections in my immediate family, only two of which were successful, I decided that I never wanted to be an elected official. But I wanted to do--know the infrastructure of an elected official.  And I felt like I didn't need graduate school for that.  I need--I could create my own graduate school experiences.  So I wanted to know how to write legislation, how to campaign, how to deal with the media, and then how to raise money.  So in some ways, the opportunity to fundraise for the ACLU was perfect because I had always wanted to raise money.  Because black candidates were always starved for this infrastructure.  They had a great rap, they had a great, you know, message, but often times there was nothing behind them.  It was like the Wizard of Oz behind the curtain.  And I wanted to be a person who was the go-to woman for politics. I could figure out how to get the press in the story, and how to raise the money, and how to do all that stuff.  So it was a great opportunity, and I had to raise $250,000 my first year.  And I met my fundraising goals.  And that affiliate is all connected with the Hollywood types. So we had, you know, fundraisers, and Michael Jackson [performer] was at one of my fundraisers and Raquel Welch [actress] and the Smothers Brothers [entertainers].  And, you know, a lot of Hollywood producer kind of director types. Jack Lemmon [actor], Walter Matthau [actor].  And so it was a great experience.  But it was so much pressure, because people would come in and say, "Did we make our fundraising goals?" 'Cause they knew if we didn't make it they would be laid off.  And I just didn't like that kind of intense pressure.  So then I worked for this gay consulting firm called Mixner/Scott [Inc.].  These were two men who were out of the closet who were taking on corporate America and helping them with their public relations.  They were wild guys.  And so they gave me a chance. And so I was an account exec[utive].  And I brought in the City of Compton [California] as a client. And I brought in--I was on the Chevron [U.S.A. Inc.] account. And I had to deal with these corporate types who I had never dealt with before.  This great experience, advising them on their divestment stuff in South Africa and their relations with environmentalists.  Great stuff.  And so then the ACLU says, "Come back. We want you to interview for executive director."  So my husband had worked for [San Francisco, California Mayor] Willie Brown at one point.  And so I go up to Willie Brown at a fundraiser. And I had these encounters with Willie Brown through my husband. Mainly social kinds of encounters, and I said, "Mr. Brown, I need you to write a letter of recommendation for me, because I'm gonna apply for the executive director of the ACLU in Southern California."  And he said, "Why are you doing that?"  And I said, "Well they asked me to apply."  He says, "No, I'm not gonna write a recommendation for you."  And I was just devastated.  I'm like, "What had I done to this man?"  And he said, "You're gonna work for me."  And so I said, "You're not serious." And he said, "Yes I am."  I said, "Well what are you gonna have me do?"  He said, "You're gonna be chief of staff of my Los Angeles office."  So I called him and I didn't get a call back.  And I called a week later. And I told my husband, "He's not serious."  Then a week after that he calls me, "When you gonna start?"  And so there I am, chief of staff of his Los Angeles office.  And I do that for two years.
Story_ID: 11178
Speaker 1: And then my marriage is breaking up, and I separate from my husband [John A. Miner, III].  I start dating this guy Bertram Lee.  And Bertram Lee happens to be the chair of the finance committee for the '88 [1988 Rev. Jesse] Jackson for President campaign.  So he says, you know, "You know how to raise money." Because I raised money for [San Francisco, California Mayor] Willie Brown after hours while I worked for him.  And I raised a lot of money for Willie Brown and I enjoyed it.  And he says, "You know how to raise money." I said, "Yeah."  He says, "Well Jesse's looking for a fundraiser."  And so I said, "Well his operation is in Chicago [Illinois] and I'm in L.A. [Los Angeles, California]." So he says, "I'm gonna recommend you to Jesse." And so we started dating.  And then I get hired by Jesse Jackson to be his fundraiser.  And then I just didn't think it was appropriate to be dating the chair of the finance committee, you know.  And then I worked for--(break in interview)--then it's Laura Murphy Lee.  I think that's the way it's gonna be for the rest of my life too.
Speaker 2: (laughter)Well, at least you've been twice blessed.
Speaker 1: I don't regret either one of my marriages.  I understand why I got in 'em and why I got out.
Speaker 2: Out of them (laughs).
Speaker 1: And from my second marriage I have a beautiful son. So--better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all.
Speaker 2: So now, give me your husband's--you said John Miner?
Speaker 1: John A. Miner III
Story_ID: 11179
Speaker 1: So you were telling a story of you were working, you know--you came here--well did you come to Chicago [Illinois] at that point?
Speaker 2: Well Bertram Lee was based in Boston [Massachusetts] and I was based in Los Angeles [California]. So we decided to move to Chicago, 'cause he had family in Chicago.  His daughter--he was a widower. And his daughter had come to Chicago to live with her maternal grandmother 'cause he was a businessman and he was always on the road, so his youngest daughter--he had two daughters.  So two months after we started dating he proposes to me. Six months after that we're married, and six months after that I'm pregnant. And in that period where he proposes and I'm working for [Rev. Jesse] Jackson, I just, you know--he wants me to travel with all of his business deals.  And he was in the process of buying the Denver Nuggets basketball team and, you know. It was just too much.  I couldn't--it was just a whole new life, living at a whole faster pace. So I leave [Rev.] Jesse [Jackson Sr.].  Jesse's mad 'cause I'm doing a great job.  I help him with his FEC [Federal Election Commission] compliance. And, you know, I'm a true believer, so. But I maintain a good friendship with Jesse even to this day, so I'm not worried about it.  And so then I'm married to Bert. And I--this is the first time in my life that I don't have a paying job--that I don't have my own paycheck. You know, and it's--it was one of the most difficult periods in my life, because my work had become my identity. I'm glad I had that experience, because that shouldn't happen.  I mean it should be a part--you should find your mission in life and you should love it, but it shouldn't be the only thing that you are--excuse me--or the only way you define yourself.  So what do I do?  I become involved in every conceivable political campaign that I can get involved in, and start raising money for candidates. 'cause I know, you know, I can do that on the side.  I can help raise my stepdaughter who's fifteen.  I can help raise my infant, and I can host all these events.
Story_ID: 11180
Speaker 1: My life became one long series of fundraising events.  I mean we raised money for [Ronald H.] Ron Brown who was trying to become head of the DNC [Democratic National Committee], for [Illinois Attorney General] Roland Burris, for Carol Moseley Braun when she was running for [Cook County, Illinois] recorder of deeds.  We raised money for out of town candidates like [Atlanta, Georgia Mayor] Maynard Jackson and Mike Espy from Mississippi, who was then a Congressman.  And we raised money for Doug Wilder who was running for a second term in gov--as governor [of Virginia].  And we raised money and we just, you know. We put together most--a big contingent of the black business community in Chicago [Illinois].  And then because of my ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union] contacts, I also got a good, strong, Jewish liberal contingent.  So we're really raising money. And we become the go-to couple.  And after four or five years of that, the marriage begins to disintegrate.  I married a much older man [Bertram Lee], seventeen years older.  Different values about the role of women, you know.  I've always been my own person, always been tenaciously independent and opinionated and all of that stuff. Which--great characteristics in men, but not always viewed as great characteristics in women.  And I know this about myself, so I just say, "I can't.  I can't deal with this."  So--but before we break up, we host this really great fundraiser for Sharon Pratt Dixon, who then becomes [Washington, D.C. Mayor] Sharon Pratt Kelly.  So she wins. And when--you know, as I'm trying to deal with my broken life and deal with my child [Bertram Lee, Jr.] and stepchild and all the other issues, she calls me up and says, "I want you to work for me."  And I said, "Oh, I'm flattered."  And I knew if I could get back to Washington, D.C., I could be fully independent--that Washington was my turf.  I knew the [Capitol] Hill.  I didn't know D.C. government, but I knew if I just could get back to D.C., get on my own footing, get my own paycheck back, that I could figure out the rest of my life after that. So I say, "Yeah."  And I said--but before I--I say yeah before I know what she wants me to do. And she says, "I want you to run my tourism operation."  I'm like, "Tourism?  It seems so shallow.  You know, isn't that just about you know, tour operators and travel?" And she said, "Laura, it's the largest private industry in Washington, D.C..  And I need somebody like you who is comfortable in black environments and white environments.  And I know you can get these hotel types and folks under control."  So I go in and I tell her, she needs an office of tourism. And she said, "Well if you can get it through the City Council.  I can't use my political cap on it."  So I proceed to lobby the City Council.  We get an office of tourism created.  We bring in World Cup soccer.  We bring in Tour DuPont.  You know, we change our advertising message for the city to help deal with, you know, the so-called bad [Washington, D.C. Mayor] Marion Barry image--which I never accepted, 'cause I'm a Marion Barry fan, notwithstanding his personal crises.  She wasn't but I was.  So we try--we find a way to market the city and accentuate African American history and culture, and it was fabulous.  I had to go to Japan, and then I had to go to Korea.  One of our goals was to open up more international routes with airlines to bring more Asian tourists in particular, because they have a high spending rate per capita.  And so we were successful in getting Korea Airlines [sic, Korean Air] to open up a travel--a direct flight from Seoul [South Korea] to Dulles [International Airport]. Which has really, you know, changed the city.  So it's fabulous, fabulous, fabulous.  And I was going great guns, had just sort of gotten into it.  Really kind of got the Office of Tourism established and settled.

Speaker 1: Then a headhunter calls me back and says, "We want you to work for the ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union]."  I'm like, "Not again. Come on."  I said, "No, I'm really don't want to."  He said, "Well, just talk to Ira Glasser the executive director."  And so I go to New York [New York] and talk to Ira for what's supposed to be forty-five minutes. And three hours later, I'm sold.  And so that's what I've been doing for the last eight years.
Speaker 2: So how was it like to be back at, you know, the ACLU? I mean this was--you were--.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) A lobbyist in the office, I now direct.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.  And--.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) I'm sorry.  I'm not supposed to talk over you.  I'm supposed to let you finish your sentence.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) No no, that's okay.  But how--what was that like being back at this point in time?  You had matured.  There were a lot of things that you had--.
Speaker 1: Well, you know, nobody was there from the old days except one secretary. The director I worked for left long ago and there was another director. And people there were very loyal to the previous director.  And man, they wanted to have a mutiny when I was selected.  I wasn't an attorney, they didn't know anything about my background, they saw my resume. But, you know, "Who is she?"  And so I had to clean house. And it took about two years, maybe three years to get my own staff in there.  And they--you know, they were doing everything to try to make me leave and all this other stuff.  This is my own staff.  Not my boss, my boss was 100 percent behind me.  And so I said, "Okay.  I'll be damned.  I'll leave when I friggin' feel like it.  I'm gonna retool this operation, and I'm just gonna wear these people out.  I'm going to make them work so hard they'll--they can't stand it."  And I did.  And so I got a great staff. And the budget has doubled during my tenure.  It's about a two and a half million-dollar operation.  It used to be solely a lobbying operation.  Now we've got a huge Internet grass roots capacity. We've sent about a half a million letters to [U.S.] Congress in the last two years alone.  We publish more, we're in the press much more.  We have a press office--there was no press office there.  And my goal was to make the ACLU competitive with the Christian Coalition. It had grass roots, they had media, they had--so we've really, really, really retooled the place.  It looks nothing like--there were no job descriptions when I was there.  There was no org.[organization] chart. This is, you know, liberal do-gooder, half-assed, non-profit structure.  So, you know, my small time in the private sector and my time in government--there needed to be a structure. There needed to be a mission statement.  There needed to be job descriptions. There needed to be accountability. And so I think it's a great office.  We've made great strides.
Story_ID: 11182
Speaker 1: I was asking a question about the ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union] and it's sort of--well I could ask the legacy question--but its role. You know. Its role in--.
Speaker 2: See I guess Americans take a lot of freedoms for granted.  And we haven't had an epic struggle over what the Bill of Rights means or a constitutional crisis like other governments go through.  And so what people need to understand about the Bill of Rights is that the Bill of Rights are designed to tell people what rights they have, that the government cannot violate--so the right to free speech.  The right not to have the state impose a particular religion on people.  The right of  freedom of the press.  The right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures. The right of due process of law and the right of equal protection of the law.  So these are all things to put controls on the federal government so that we don't elect tyrants and people can just take away our newspapers, like they do in Russia. You know, the head of the largest independent newspaper in Russia is now in jail. Or what they'll do in South American countries is that they'll go after the judges or they'll go after the newspaper writers.  So the Constitution is the architecture for government. The separation of houses, it establishes the judicial, the executive and the legislative branch, and talks about the powers of government.  And the Bill of Rights really are about the limits on government, that give us our individual liberty. So that's the context for what the ACLU does. The Bill of Rights is not self-enforcing. You have to go into court and sue.  Or you have to do public education, or you have to lobby Congress to make sure that the government pays attention to these rights and doesn't violate the rights of free people. So, what happens with the ACLU is that more often than not, the people, whose rights are violated are the least popular people. You know, if you get up and say, "Hey, let's everybody say the Pledge of Allegiance."  You know, you're going to be with 90 percent of the American people. But if you get up and you say, "I'm so angry at this country and its policies toward the poor and its policies toward Haitian refugees, and its policies on this, that, and the other and I'm going to burn the American flag."  Oh well,  who do you think needs the help of the ACLU the most?  And so we're always getting press coverage on the extreme people we represent. So if the League of Women Voters wants to not march in Skokie, no, it's not even going to make the news. The Nazis wanna march or the [Klu Klux] Klan wants to march or the Nation of Islam wants to march then that's when government tries to pass all kinds of rules and regulations to make sure those people don't come in and disrupt the peace and quiet in their town.  Now, those, oddballs, weirdos, dissenters, kooks, whatever you want to call the people we represent are also American citizens. And they have a right to free speech. We end up representing the parents of a child who don't want to say, 'The Lord's Prayer' in school. Now I grew up in public schools saying 'The Lord's Prayer.' You probably did too. And I didn't--I don't think it has any--what's a matter?
Speaker 1: (Inaudible off-camera discussion)
Speaker 2: I don't have any problem, you know, myself saying it because I believe it. But if you're, you know, Muslim or Buddhist and you don't want your child reciting those prayers, that's when the ACLU comes in and says, "The government cannot force you to say--to worship a particular religion. The government cannot impose Christianity on everybody."  And so, a lot of people think we go too far.  And it's usually because we're representing somebody who is offensive. But the popular people, the people in good standing with the government don't need us as much as the people, who dissent. But I mean we represent the protestors at this upcoming inauguration. We represented the protestors at the Democratic and Republican Convention. We represented the protestors at the--not WHO [World Health Organization]. What's the world something--meeting in Seattle [Washington]?
Speaker 1: (Unclear) World Trade--.
Speaker 2: WTO meeting, World Trade Organization in Seattle [in 1999].  And those are my kids and your kids, and my neighbor's kids. And, you know, people, who believe in economic justice or anti-abortion, or pro-affirmative action or, you know.  So we don't get that kind of coverage. It's only when we get the extreme.  And the extreme is not the bulk of our work. You'd be surprised how many average people we end up representing.  And it's still one of the few majority white organizations that vigorously defends affirmative action and vigorously defends the voting rights act.  And so because I had this uncle, who was brought before the House Committee--[U.S.] House [of Representatives] Un-American Activities Committee [HUAC] for his political beliefs and his political associations, I'm a huge lover of the First Amendment. And because I was nearly put out of junior high school for not saying, the 'Pledge of Allegiance.'  So this is a continuum for me. It is not--I go from, you know, the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] to this. And that's my--you know, if we can't talk about tough issues, then we are really doomed. And so I'm not the person you come to if you wanna you know, if you wanna be politically correct. 'Cause politically correct people don't have anything to worry about. But if you wanna advocate for something that's unusual or something then, you know, I'm gonna be there fighting for you in [U.S.] Congress because those people don't have a lot of resources.
Story_ID: 11183
Speaker 1: What do you want to accomplish from this point on in your life, do you think?  You're still very young. So is there anything that you would, you know, sort of, you know, dream or dare to want to do or accomplish or experience?
Speaker 2: Early retirement [laughs]. You know. I've been going since seven. You know, my time since college is twenty-five years. Okay? But that doesn't include, you know--it's been one tread wheel after another. And I love it, but I'm an artist. I do printmaking and sculpture. And I would really like to paint and make prints and sculpt for two years. I mean I think I owe it to myself. Because, you know, you don't get any rest in this work. You open the paper and you get mad about something. Or you know the ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union] has to act. I mean I don't--you know, I don't control my schedule.  [The U.S.] Congress does something outrageous, we've gotta act.  We don't have a choice in the matter.  And, you know, last weekend we were getting out a report on [Attorney General John] Ashcroft. So I worked Saturday, Sunday and Monday getting that report out plus criticizing [U.S. President Bill] Clinton for why he didn't do these things on race when he had the power to do something about it. He came out with a statement on race.  And so that was an ABC [American Broadcasting Company] TV appearance, a CNN [Cable News Network] TV appearance on Monday.  And on Saturday it was a MSNBC [and] Fox News TV appearance, you know.  And my son says, "Mom, didn't you tell me you were going to stay home all weekend?"  And so the Christmas tree lights are still up [laughs].  And all the needles are on the floor.  And I have a feeling it's gonna be that way with the [U.S. President George W.] Bush administration. That it's just gonna be--but this year's already gone off [claps hands] like that.  And I don't think--I'm an optimist. That's the thing that keeps me fueled. I'm a true believer. I believe that if I can just talk to you, I can find the good in you.  And I can make you understand my point of view, at least not--you won't be able to wail against me like I'm some alien. Right?  But to be an optimist, to be a leader, you've gotta have enough energy and you've gotta refuel your jets.  And, I'm coming to a point where I can't figure out what I wanna do with the rest of my life. And I think it's just because I'm tired, you know.  And--but I know it will be, you know, I think about being a full-time political fundraiser. I like to do it. It's not enough folks doing it for black candidates or for worthy causes.  I could do that. I think I could give back by being on boards, you know, but I still like my paycheck. You know. I can't--the idea of not having that check coming in really bothers me.  So I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Story_ID: 11184
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about politics and the world of politics. You know. Why--you've been so politically active. You come from a family that was politically active.  What--why is it important for African Americans to--well before I ask that question.  Do you still have belief in the political system?
Speaker 2: Yes I do. Yes I do.  And I like elected officials. They give up so much to serve.  And it's a service job. I mean it's not like you go in and make a movie and then you sit back and realize the profits.  And you can do it independently with your producer, and your director, and your, you know, your actors and then market it.  And then be done with it.  Their phones ring. They're accountable to the press. They're accountable to the public, to the constituents. They have to stand before them and ask them to vote for them and just worry that every little smarmy detail of their teenager's drug abuse or whatever.  Or their infidelities are gonna come out.  And it really doesn't have anything to do with their ability to be good thinkers and good leaders in some cases. Not in all cases. They give up their privacy. They have to raise money constantly.  And it's hard work, and it's relentless.  And I've seen it in my parents and my siblings.  So I love them. I love them. I really like 'em.  And I think running for political office is so important because government has a lot of resources and to the victor goes the spoils.  And so you can make this agency award contracts.  And you can make them pave streets that haven't been paved, to put a stop light in.  And you can make them give a grant to, you know, a woman's college or historically black college.  You can make them fund Head Start [Program] at a higher level.  I mean this is what people need to participate in a democratic society. They need education. They need healthcare. They need reasonable taxes, you know. They need somebody to help them.  And it's in incredibly powerful being an elected official. You look at the legacy of [U.S. Congressman] Parren Mitchell, who started minority business programs in the federal government.  And all of these guys, who are hauling garbage and paving roads and computer contracts, and, you know, consultants would not have a foot in the door without this man.  And they don't even realize what he's done.  They probably don't even know his name.  But it is enormously powerful.  And, you know, if you don't get in there, the resources will go to somebody else.  So if you don't get women in there, women aren't gonna get the National Institutes of Health to put enough resources into breast cancer. If you don't get minorities in there, stuff is not going to go to minority communities.  If you don't get, you know, rural people in there.  You know, farmers are gonna, you know, go off and go into oblivion, and it'll be agro business. If you don't get urban people in there, then the streets are gonna decay and the--you know?  So I think public office is very, very important.  And I'm just very dismayed that we're in an era in the United States where there's such disdain for elected officials. And the price of going into public office, you know, loss of your privacy, the strains on your family, you know.  You take a financial hit, 'cause you never get paid what the jobs are worth.  These are very, very discouraging to our best and our brightest. And, you know, that's another thing I would like to do is I would like to stay in touch with young people to motivate them to make a difference. I remember when I was working for Parren Mitchell.  There's this disfiguring disease call vitiligo where pigment is lost on people of darker skins.  So African Americans, East Indians get vitiligo.  And you'll see people with these splotchy things. Well, nobody was paying any attention to this disease.  So two doctors, one from Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] and one from Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] said, "We want a grant.  A government grant to study this disease. We think we have a hook on it.  But we need more resources."  So NIH, National Institutes of Health wouldn't give them the time of day.  Parren Mitchell put me on it.  So we couldn't get a separate bill passed to get this kind of research funded.  So what we did is we worked with [U.S.] Congressman Louis Stokes of the Appropriations Committee who had jurisdiction over the National Institutes of Health. Who put a line in the budget saying, "This committee will look very harshly on the National Institutes of Health if they fail to do whatever."  And so they don't want to anger the members of the Appropriations Committee.  So two years later, they have funding.  And they're making new medicines.  And people who are not getting jobs because they can't stem the loss of their pigment are no longer as severely disfigured.  And I remember a girlfriend who graduated with me from Wellesley [College, Wellesley, Massachusetts], came up to me at a party, not long after this happened and said, "I'm studying dermatology at Howard Medical School. And I'm on a very special grant.  We're studying the cause of vitiligo. And it's groundbreaking research."  And I said, "Let me tell you how you got that grant!"  And, you know, I'm one staff person.  One person!  And now every time I see somebody with vitiligo, I wanna say, "Guess what we did it! We did it! We did it!"  You know. You don't have to have as much pain and suffering and emotional distress. There's something we can do. You know. "Have you been to Howard?"  I've gone up to people with vitiligo and said, "Do you know about the clinic at Howard?" And they'd say no. I haven't gone into the whole history of how Howard got its money or how Yale got its money or anything like that.  But, you know, there's things like that, that happen all the time and people don't know it. It's very powerful.  And so you can--I don't have disdain for people who work in the private sector.  I think it's great. I think creative people in particular are great. I think the non-profit community is great.  And how if even if you're a designer at Microsoft [Corporation].  Wonderful, fine, fine, fine.  But we need people in public service.  Absolutely.

Speaker 1: What about African Americans?  You know, there's a push right now for economic empowerment.  And a lot of times politics now are viewed as sort of pass√©, that was our first thing, now we need to get--that's even been [Rev.] Jesse's [Jackson Sr.] message of recent.
Speaker 2: What do you think about that?
Speaker 1: I still think that tax breaks for economic empowerment, declaration of enterprise zones, all these things come through the government. The regulation of investment bankers and private banking. All these things are regulated agencies. And if you don't have anybody at the Federal Trade Commission or the Banking Committee in the [U.S.] House or Senate, you know, or in any of these agencies that--or at IRS [Internal Revenue Service], then you can do all these great things. And then end up having the rug pulled out from under you for all of your great economic development programs.  All the great ones, I think, have been to some extent private government partnerships.  And at the very least, have to comply with government regulations.  So don't you want somebody on the inside while you're doing that?  I think you do.
Story_ID: 11186
Speaker 1: Now what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: That she was courageous. That she was a courageous advocate on behalf of people whose rights were being denied.  That she was a fighter.  And she was a good field marshal in battles for liberty. But I want people to have the courage of their convictions.  And that she empowered other people to fight too, gave them hope.  That she inspired people.  That would be quite a lot. That would be quite satisfactory.
