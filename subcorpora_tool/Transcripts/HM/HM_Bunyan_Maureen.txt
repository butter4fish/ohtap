Story_ID: 36936
Speaker 1: Now I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side but separately, and then we'll put them together.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Wilhelmina, W-I-L-H-E-L-M-I-N-A, Leonara, L-E-O-N-A-R-A, Hill, H-I-L-L.
Speaker 1: Okay and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in Georgetown, British Guiana, G-U-I-A-N-A and her date of birth was April 28, 1913.
Speaker 1: Okay and, so well what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: My mother's, my mother came from a family of--she had seven brothers and sisters.  She was the second oldest.  Her mother was named Charlotte Rawlings and her father was Albert Hill and they, both of my grandparents, were born and raised in Georgetown, Guiana and both of their parents, on both sides, were from Guiana.  And my mother's side of the family really is a Guianese, completely Guianese family in that they were the descendants of some of the English people who settled in Guiana in the early 1800s from Britain and some of the mixed African and white people living in Guiana in the 1800s.  So they were, they were a long time, old, old Guianese family.  My mother told me that in the days when she was growing up in Guiana; of course it was a British colony.  And so like many of the British colonies people emulated the English style of living and people adopted the so-called "middle class" culture of, of the British people who lived in Guiana and the British culture of Guiana.  So she's said, she's told me and she's told me and my aunts and uncles they were all raised to be very proper.  Everybody had to learn English and know English and speak English better than the best of the English people and life was very circumscribed.  You went to church.  You went to school.  That was it.
Speaker 1: Tea times part of it?
Speaker 2: No they didn't have tea--
Speaker 1: [Not clear]
Speaker 2: --(laughs) not in Guiana.  It's too hot for tea.
Speaker 1: Alright, okay.
Speaker 2: But, you know, family life was very, very stiff and in my mother's home my grandfather died; I think when my mother was in her late teens or early twenties and so my grandmother became the real matriarch of the family and she ruled with an iron fist. (Laughs)  The model for women in power in those days, in the family or other places, was Queen Victoria because this was just at the end of the Victorian Age.  So women carried themselves, you know, in a queenly way and if you were running a family of eight children you really, really took charge and especially since five of them were boys.  So my mother always; I knew my grandmother when I was a small girl, but my mother always used my grandmother as an example of a strong woman who took charge and really kept the family in one piece.
Speaker 1: I suppose your grandmother was probably born in 1880s?
Speaker 2: Yes, I think she was born in the late 1870s or early 1880s.  I'm not sure of the date. (Simultaneous)
Story_ID: 36937
Speaker 1: In comparison to the United States, the British outlawed slavery in the 1830s so anyone in Guiana would have been free.  I mean, you know, at least--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --at least living free.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Um hm, um hm.
Speaker 1: You know since that time.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: It gave us about a thirty-five year head start on the United States--
Speaker 2: Um hm, um hm.
Speaker 1: --in that respect.  So okay, are there any stories in your family about, about the days of slavery or the end of slavery or any [unclear]--
Speaker 2: No.  What I know about the history of, of Guiana and this certainly goes for my father's [Arthur Bunyan] side of the family too.  Of course it was a very poor country; very few, very little infrastructure.  The British did not invest in the country.  It was important for the production of sugar.  So cane plantations; the production of sugar was the major--and a little bit of, of fishing--was the major business or an export, and everything else really was--the entire infrastructure of Georgetown [Guiana] which is a small city of course was built to support the export, the growth and export of cane and the production of sugar.  And my mother's [Wilhelmina Hill] side of the family didn't work in sugar but my father's side did.  But my mother's side of the family were people who were clerks and ministers.  And Georgetown like so many other places with British culture as you grow up you had three choices for careers or for ways of living.  You could join the civil service and work for the government as a clerk.  You could join the ministry and become a minister in the Anglican Church or work in a church, or you could become a teacher and teach in one of the church schools or in one of the public schools.  And in my mother's side of the family people became teachers and worked in the church as well as, or civil servants.  So they did all three.  The men did all three and my mother was interested in nursing so she studied nursing in Guiana and got her nursing certificate in Guiana as a young woman.  And her sisters, she had two sisters--one sister actually was very active in the church and she was the person who founded the Girl Guides in Guiana.  The Girl Guides of course was the English Girl Scouts.  So it was a lot of civic participation in the family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 36938
Speaker 1: I'm gonna go to your father's side now.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Arthur, A-R-T-H-U-R, Hughborn, H-U-G-H-B-O-R-N, Mendes, M-E-N-D-E-S, Bunyan, B-U-N-Y-A-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now are there any stories behind any of these names?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  (Laughs)  Well let's see.  Let's start with Bunyan.  Bunyan is the anglicized version of a French name, Buignon which is spelled B-U-I-G-N-O-N, and Buignon is an old name from Normandy [France] dating back to the Middle Ages.  When the Normans invaded Britain in the 1500s, of course they brought the French language and lots of French names and as those names, as they married into the English community the names were changed.  And there was a family name of Buignon, the French name, that settled in the parish of Bedfordshire in southeastern Britain and that name subsequently became Bunyan as it became anglicized.  And John Bunyan was born in Bedfordshire of the Bunyan family--
Speaker 1: The famous John Bunyan?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Who wrote--the poet and writer, who wrote "Pilgrims' Progress" in the 1500s.  So he was one of the descendants of the Buignons of France.  (Laughs)
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I'm not claiming to be related to him but the family probably is all; we, the Bunyans know that this is where we came from (laughs) 400, 500 years ago is where the name came from.  This is where the name came from and the connection to my father's name is that my father has English ancestry.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then my father's third name, Mendes, is Portuguese because my father also had Portuguese ancestry from Madeira [Portugal].  A lot of, there were in Guiana--I, I'll just trace back a little bit of the history.  After slavery was outlawed in Guiana and then probably thirty to forty years later, many, many people of Portuguese--from Portugal came to Guiana.  Most of the people came from the island of Madeira which is in the Atlantic [Ocean] just southwest of Portugal.  It's part of Portugal.  Madeira was known for its cane, sugar cane growing and many Portuguese men moved from Madeira to Guiana to do the same kind of work raising sugar, sugar cane.  And my father's great, great grandfather came from Madeira and his name was Mendes, M-E-N-D-E-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And Madeira is spelled M-A--
Speaker 2: M-A-D-E-I-R-A.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: Um hm.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: Um hm, and my father's family also goes back at least; I know of four generations in Guiana, including my great, great grandmother whose name was G-N-O-U-P-E, Gnoupe and she was an Amerindian, an indigenous woman of Guiana from the Amerindian group in Guiana was named the Arau, A-R-A-U, Arau people.  And of course they were there before the British (laughs) and the Africans and the Portuguese and everybody else.
Story_ID: 36939
Speaker 1: I remember seeing a coloring book from Guiana in the '70s [1970s] I think that's produced during the time that Forbes Burnham was president--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --which sort of outlined the different racial strains in Guiana,
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --and where everybody comes from, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I think the purpose of the book for children was to let them understand how all the groups came to Guiana [unclear]--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --that they're all Guianese, you know.
Speaker 2: Very, very [simultaneous], very racially mixed country because the; first you have to remember that in the, in the late 1800s there was a lot of population move around the world.  It was one of the first times when people actually had; they had transportation and were able to move because we had more shipping.  They certainly weren't flying (laughs) in those days and also because especially in the Americas there was a lot of economic development taking place and people moved.  And, you know from, and this was long after the slave trade but people moved from Europe to Latin America to South America.  People moved from North America to South America to find opportunities to work and so Guiana was a particularly interesting spot because Guianese can really trace their racial mix to six or seven different peoples:  African, English, White, Portuguese, indigenous people and Chinese.  So we, when you meet Guianese it's very hard for many Guianese to, to describe what their racial identification is because we know we have all this mixture and so we are, we're reticent to say "oh, I'm a this,, I'm a that." Now in this country of course people of "color" quote, unquote are generally considered African, people of African descent.  So we're identified by our African descent but in Guiana for example, not so much today but in the years past, there were names for people of all different mixtures (laughs).  So if you were East Indian and African, you were, you had one name--
Speaker 1: Do you remember what the name was?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  There, no I'm not (laughs)--
Speaker 1: You're not going to imply.
Speaker 2: They are not considered polite (laughs) and they're considered, you know, sort of declasse.  If you were Chinese and African or if you were Chinese and East Indian or, you know, because we did, people did identify themselves by their color.  You know, believe me, they did, but it was not the kind of racial stratification that existed here you know in this country or in a lot of parts of the, the Americas.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 36940
Speaker 1: Now, now what did your father [Arthur Hughborn Mendes Bunyan] do for a living?  I mean did he, was he able to you know finish school?
Speaker 2: He, he had an interesting young life.  He was born on a cane plantation in Berbice, B-E-R-B-I-C-E, Guiana.  And Berbice is to the--in the northwest of Guiana and it was originally a Dutch colony, a Dutch settlement in Guiana.  The Dutch settled Guiana before the British got it and they settled the area called Berbice, and his mother worked on and lived on a cane plantation when my father was born. So he was born on the cane plantation and grew up there as a, as a young boy.  He went to school but in the British system, the British colonial system and up until recently, the system in school was when you were thirteen [years old] you took an exam and with the results of that exam they determined whether you would go on to further education or whether your education would stop at the age of thirteen.  My father got malaria and he was sick and could not take the exam.  And the exam was given once a year, once a year only, no makeup, no excuses.  If you weren't there, you weren't there.  That was it.  My father always told me that he was heartbroken because he thought he had potential and he could not go on in school in Guiana.  So he instead got an apprentice to an electrician and for his, in his teenage years he worked with this electrician.  And then years later in the 1930s he had an opportunity to move to Aruba.  And the story of that is simply that oil was discovered off the coast of Venezuela in Lake Maracaibo in the early part of the century.  And in the thirties (1930s) the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey built a big oil refinery on Aruba because Aruba was close to Lake Maracaibo and the oil was taken from Venezuela, shipped by tanker to Aruba and them partially refined in the refinery in Aruba and then shipped on to New Jersey.  So when Standard Oil built the oil refinery in Aruba, it opened up jobs for lots of people and thousands of men mostly were recruited from all over the Caribbean and Central America and all over the world for that matter to move to Aruba to work in the oil refinery.  Many Guianese went:  my father, my mother's [Wilhelmina Hill] half-brother, my mother's sister (laughs), my mother, many people from Panama, from Columbia, Venezuela, the U.S., India, China, all over the world went to work in that oil refinery.  And my father continued his education there.  My mother was a nurse in the hospital in Aruba and her sister also and her brother-in-law were there and that's where my sisters and I were born.  So my father continued his education in Aruba and when we left Aruba in the 1950s and moved to Wisconsin [United States] the first thing he told me, the first thing he said was I'm going back to school.  The reason we moved to Wisconsin as a matter of fact was in order for us, my sisters and myself, to get an education.  So education was always his priority and I think because he was denied the chance as a young man to continue his education under the British system, he always was convinced that he would have a chance to do that in this country, which he did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'll tell you more about that later.
Speaker 1: Alright, okay.
Story_ID: 36941
Speaker 1: So (clearing throat), so when he was in, before he moved to Milwaukee [Wisconsin] was he; now your father [Arthur Hughborn Mendes Bunyan], I have in my notes, became an electrical engineer. So he was already an electrician--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did he become an engineer in, in--
Speaker 2: In Wisconsin.
Speaker 1: In Wisconsin.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: So he continued to study in Wisconsin--
Speaker 2: Um hm, um hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As he, briefly he, oh let's see.  I think in about the late '50s (1950s) I was in high school from '58 (1958) until '62 (1962) and he began, he went back to school.  At about that time, probably '61 (1961), '62 (1962) and essentially did a bachelor's degree, two master's degrees and subsequently he started working on his, his Ph.D. [degree].  He did all the course work for his Ph.D. but in the early '70s (1970s) he got glaucoma and his eyesight diminished a lot and he couldn't finish his doc--his doctoral dissertation for his Ph.D. but he was in school at the same time as my sister and I were (laughs) in school.  We were all in college together but as an adult he, you know, got all those degrees.  So he did it while working full time too and he did it by commuting hundreds of miles as a matter of fact.  So--
Speaker 1: Where, where did he go to school as a matter of fact?  You all were living in Milwaukee, right?
Speaker 2: We were just outside of Milwaukee and in the late '50s (1950s) and early '60s (1960s) and he was commuting from where we were living in Waukesha, Wisconsin.  He was commuting to a college called Stout College in Upstate Wisconsin.  He would go once a week.  It was a round trip of about 400 miles and he got his bachelor's degree there.  And then he went on to Milwaukee Technical College and then to, I believe it was the University of Wisconsin for two master's degrees and also his days of work on his doctorate; the University of Wisconsin in, in Milwaukee.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So he was, he was a studier.  (Laughs)
Speaker 1: Okay, bright and steady climbing.
Story_ID: 36942
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents [Wilhelmina Hill and Arthur Hughborn Mendes Bunyan] met?
Speaker 2: The only story I know is that of course in Guiana in those days Georgetown the capital was a very small place.  Everybody knew everybody and I don't know exactly how, but I think my parents probably knew each other as young people.  My mother's family was large and I know that they knew a lot of people.  My father's family was small but I don't know exactly how they met but I do know that they knew each other as, as teenagers and as young, as young adults.  And my, well actually there was a kind of interesting story.  My godfather Kenny Khan [sp.], who is Guianese, was actually; let me think back to, to proper sequence.  (Laughs)  His--my godfather's wife (laughs) Leela and Kenny Khan are their names, and they're still alive.  They're in their late nineties now, living in Florida.  Leela Khan's sister was engaged to my father, and they broke up.  She, I believe Leela introduced my father to my mother.  They may have known each other but not well and I believe that was what happened.  So the sister of the woman that my father was first engaged to introduced my mother to my father because they were friends.  But I don't know the exact circumstance or other particulars. But believe me it was a small town so everybody knew everybody.  (Laughs)
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.
Speaker 2: [Unclear]
Story_ID: 36943
Speaker 1: Now when you think about your parents' [Wilhelmina Hill and Arthur Hughborn Mendes Bunyan] talents, their, their motivations, their looks, their dispositions, who do you think you take after?
Speaker 2: My father, my father because he was a very strong personality.  My mother died when I was fifteen [years old] and she died in Wisconsin and she had been sick for three years before she died with cancer, with breast cancer.  And she died in 1960.  So the very early years of my life I was, I was of course very close to my mother but because she got sick when I was basically twelve,  I think just before I was thirteen, those three years I spent and my sisters and my father spent taking care of her.  So it was very, very stressful and very, very difficult.  And I think those are the years when you, when a daughter really gets close to the mother and I remember things like she was a great seamstress and she taught me about clothing; how to sew, and she also was a very fastidious housekeeper.  So she taught me about housekeeping, but she got sick just as she was teaching me about cooking.  So I never learned to cook, and it dawned on me years and years ago when you know people would say "well, why don't you cook, why don't you cook?" And I would say "Oh I don't know.  I just don't.  You know I'm too busy."  And then I thought about it for a--and I said you know my mother never taught me how to cook.  And she was a very, very good cook but it's amazing how that; her death stopped that part of my development and that part of my relationship with her of course.  She also missed Guiana a lot and she died about five years after we moved to Wisconsin.  And I know that living in Wisconsin was a big, big challenge for her because as I said she came from a big family in, in Guiana and Aruba and moving from Aruba to Wisconsin was a huge, huge change.  So I think that she also probably was lonely in those years and had a difficult time and then of course sadly she also got sick.  So my first years I think my mother was the big, biggest influence but after that my father really was a huge, huge influence on me.
Speaker 1: Okay, even though he in, he was going to school and [unclear]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah because he was an example.  You know he was an example and he was very strict with us.  He, you know we were very conservative and he; I don't know how he did it but he managed to move us into a small town in southeastern Wisconsin where there were no people of color, absolutely nobody.  And yet he managed to find in the Milwaukee [Wisconsin] area, a black lawyer to be our family lawyer, Vel Phillips [Velvalea Rodgers "Vel" Phillips] and Dale Phillips--
Speaker 1: Yes [Unclear]
Speaker 2: Vel, you know the names, he found them.  (Laughs)  I don't know how he found them.  This is before Vel Phillips went into politics in Milwaukee.  She and her husband were our family lawyers.  This was back in the fifties (1950s) mind you, early fifties (1950s).  (Laughs)  My father managed to find probably one of the, the only West Indian doctor in Milwaukee (laughs), Dr. Tourney [sp.] who was a Trinidadian.  He also managed to find several Barbadians people and several Jamaicans; whoever the, whoever the Caribbean people were in Milwaukee, he found them and believe me there were probably five people:  Dr. Tourney, even Vel Phillips.  I think her family was from the Virgin Islands I believe.  But my father had this ability to do this and they would come to our house way out in Waukesha and Muskego, Wisconsin and he created, you know he built his own little Caribbean connection there in the middle of nowhere.
Story_ID: 36944
Speaker 1: Alright, so okay.  So now when you, you've got one sister?
Speaker 2: Two [Kathleen and Pamela Bunyan].
Speaker 1: Two sisters?
Speaker 2: Um hm.
Speaker 1: Okay and where are you in the line of [unclear]?
Speaker 2: I'm the eldest.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.
Speaker 2: Um hm.  We're, we're very close chronologically.  We're just eighteen months; each of us is eighteen months apart.  So we were all born quickly. (Laughs)  In Aruba. (laughs)
Speaker 1: So your household growing up consisted of you and two sisters, your mother [Wilhelmina Hill] and your father [Arthur Hughborn Mendes Bunyan]--
Speaker 2: Um hm.
Speaker 1: Anybody else lived with you like--
Speaker 2: Uh, uh.
Speaker 1: --like grandparents or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --uncles?
Speaker 2: No.  In Aruba we lived very close to my mother's sister because my mother's sister and my, my parents as well as my mother's sister and her husband moved to Aruba at about the same time.  I think both couples got married in Aruba and both had their families in Aruba.  My mother had, and father had three girls and my aunt and her husband had four boys and we lived literally down the street from each other when we were small children.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 36945
Speaker 1: Now, we always ask this question.  Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yes.  One of my earliest (laughs) childhood memories is in--playing in the backyard of our house in Aruba.  Aruba is a very, is an arid island.  It's a dry island and the backyard really was stone and dust (laughs), but we played there.  And as a little girl, probably maybe before five [years old] I had started to develop nearsightedness but I didn't know it.  My parents [Wilhelmina Hill and Arthur Hughborn Mendes Bunyan] didn't know it.  But the reason I think about the backyard was because I remember going out to play in the backyard and falling, tripping over the stones in the backyard and falling and I was always scarring up my knees.  My mother was always putting bandages on my knees and I still have those scars today.  And I remember that because it hurt (laughs) and my sisters [Kathleen and Pamela Bunyan] never fell.  So I always thought I was clumsy but when I was seven I had an eye exam.  And exactly I was in school by that time and the teachers could tell that I couldn't see the blackboard.  So I had an eye exam and they discovered I was pretty nearsighted at the age of seven; so one of my earliest memories was of tripping and falling over those stones in our backyard in our house in Aruba.  And then after that I think school because in, in the Dutch system--Aruba at that time was a Dutch possession and, and you started school very, very early.  I remember going to school and sitting in classes, in our classes in school in, in St. Nicholas in Aruba and I remember my father coming home after working at the refinery.  He had a hard hat (laughs) and I think those were, those were my earliest memories.
Story_ID: 36946
Speaker 1: Okay, now I'm gonna ask more but the, can you describe; now in, you were born in, in Aruba--
Speaker 2: Um hm.
Speaker 1: --and you were saying Aruba was a Dutch possession now--
Speaker 2: Um hm.
Speaker 1: --what, what was the language, the official language?
Speaker 2: The official language was Dutch and the schools were taught in Dutch and they still are to some--to a great extent.  But that time--Aruba has a different kind of relationship now with the Netherlands but at that time it was a possession of the Dutch and it was a part of the Netherlands Antilles.  So Dutch was the official language. Of course my parents [Wilhelmina Hill and Arthur Hughborn Mendes Bunyan], their native language was English and so they spoke English at home.  We never spoke Dutch at home; my--Papiamento which was the dialect of Aruba, my mother learned Papiamento because she worked in the hospital and she had native Aruban patients and took care of native Arubans.  So she also had to learn Papiamento, she took Papiamento lessons.
Speaker 1: Can you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: P-A-P-I-A-M-E-N-T-O.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um hm.
Speaker 1: So that's the, so that's the real language people would speak.
Speaker 2: Yes, that's their, that's their creole language.  It's a mixture of Dutch, English, Spanish, some Portuguese and some Indian.
Speaker 1: So did they teach school in proper Dutch or--
Speaker 2: Yes, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Papiamento was the language of the--
Speaker 2: Of the people. Yeah, yeah and people still of course speak Papiamento.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you speak any of it for us?
Speaker 2: Not much.  (Laughs)  I can say "bon dia," [ph.] (laughs) which is "hello."  (Laughs)  I can say "con ta bai?", which is "how are you?"  I can, you know a few other things.  I can understand it.  When I go to Aruba I, I try to speak a little bit of it and I can understand it because I have a pretty good Spanish language acquisition.  But it's, it's; it's a very, it's a very lovely dialect because it's got so many words from so many different places--
Speaker 1: Um hm.
Speaker 2: --and it's one of the, one of the few dialects that has never died out.  It's spoken basically in Aruba and Curacao, Bonaire and a little bit of it is spoken I think still in Saint Maarten and Saba and Eustatius, parts of the Dutch Antilles but it's not spoken anywhere else in the world.  But it has not died out and I think part of the reason is because Aruba had, had such a polyglot and, and a group of people.  So people did respect each other's languages and my father and mother were living there in the early part of the, the last century.  People didn't say you've got to speak this, you've got to speak that or this is the proper thing or that's not.  People respected each other's cultures as well as each other's language or you know how would you, otherwise how would you get along on, in a place that's seventy-five square miles.  (Laughs)
Speaker 1: Hmm.

Speaker 1: So just as an aside, being born in Aruba and having my formative years there really impacted my life, really had an impact on me because I saw people of all colors, people speaking all languages, people who looked different, people who cooked all different types of food and I thought that was the way the world was.  I thought that you know So and So is Chinese, So and So is Indian, So and So is Black and so and so was White.  So when we moved to the United States my family learned that's not the way it worked.
Speaker 2: [Unclear] you can see the U.S. under a different kind of eye?
Speaker 1: Yeah, and we didn't know what the U.S. was.  My parents [Wilhelmina Hill and Arthur Hughborn Mendes Bunyan] didn't know.  My father of course he, I'll tell you briefly how he got a job in Milwaukee [Wisconsin].  He was, when he was working in Aruba in the oil refinery, there were Americans working there of course and he made friends with the Americans.  One of those American guys he told, he wanted to move to the United States and that fellow put him in touch with a company in Milwaukee, the Harnischfeger Corporation.  My father applied for a job there and got a job; sight unseen, no interview and he applied for visas.  The next thing we know we got on the airplane and we flew to Milwaukee.
Speaker 2: What was the name of the company again, the?
Speaker 1: Harnischfeger Corporation.
Speaker 2: H-A-R-N-I--
Speaker 1: H-A-R-N-I-S-H-F-G-E-R.
Speaker 2: Harnischfeger.
Speaker 1: You'd better check on that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Pfister and Harnischfeger was the name and the company is still in business as, I believe as P and H.  They were a big construction company and I think they're still in business.  They build the gigantic construction cranes and if you; you may even see some of them around Washington [District of Columbia], if you see P and H, Pfister and Harnischfeger, that was the company that my father went to work for.
Story_ID: 36948
Speaker 1: And, and if I could just elaborate of that a little bit.  The, in the early '50s (1950s) of course the U.S., here in the United States the, the racial situation was much different of course than it is now, but my parents [Wilhelmina Hill and Arthur Hughborn Mendes Bunyan] did not know about racial segregation and about the social policies in the United States.  What they knew was that there was opportunity for work and for education.  So like a lot of immigrant families that's what my parents came expecting and we moved to Milwaukee.  My father, we lived actually in Milwaukee for about a year and my father wanted to move out into the country because that was the kind of place that my parents were accustomed to living in, more rural. And he bought a little house in the town of Muskego which is in the County of Waukesha, in the southwest of Milwaukee.  And when we moved out there I don't think my father had any particular expectation for how we would fit in or wouldn't fit in.  Those things I'm sure did not dawn on him because all he wanted to do was to have a home, settle in and they have a base from which to work and to raise his family.  And one of the things I learned as a young person in, in high school there was that white Americans looked at people of color, first they looked at foreigners of color, and then African Americans in a different way than they looked at each other.  So I was the first in high school and I was the only black student in my high school and the only non-American student.  So I was [air quotes] the exotic person and the reason that I was able to succeed was because I spoke English because English was our family's first language.  I think if English had not been our language, we would have had a much, much harder time.  And we lived in a nice, you know, lower-middle class neighborhood, next to a dairy farm (laughs), very simple people, very simple neighborhood but we were always the strange people in the community.  And we were always the people that other people would just look at twice.
Story_ID: 36949
Speaker 1: So I grew up being very accustomed to people stopping and looking at me (laughs) and asking questions too and so as a young girl I think I must have been 12, 11 or 12 I remember asking my father [Arthur Hughborn Mendes Bunyan], "Why do people stop and look at us and why do they ask us where we're from and how we got here?"  And my father said, "Well we're different than they are and they're a little bit shocked to see us because we're different."  And I told my father, "I think it is very rude of people to stop and stare and ask us where we came from and ask us things like did we wear shoes in the Caribbean."  And they didn't know of course where Guiana was.  They didn't know where Aruba was.  So two things happened; one was at that time in American popular culture Harry Belafonte was becoming an icon and his calypso music.  So my father would tell people when they asked where we were from.  My father would say, "You know Harry Belafonte?"  "Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."  "That's where we're from."  Now we weren't from Jamaica which (laughs) was Harry Belafonte's home.  So for years and years people use to think we were from Jamaica because we would say we're from where Harry Belafonte is from.  And then my father told me and my sisters [Kathleen and Pamela Bunyan] you have to stop expecting people to figure you out.  You have to help them figure you out.  So when they ask you where you're from, you tell them and before they ask you where you're from and who you are, you tell them.  And so I grew up with, as a young woman, with a map of the United States and South America and the Caribbean.  My father made me take the map everywhere, and I had to recite a little statement when people would ask, "Oh, who are you?"  I'd open the map, "My name is Maureen Bunyan.  I was born on the island of Aruba but my family is from Guiana.  Aruba is a small island in the Caribbean off the coast of Venezuela.  It is a Dutch island, although people speak Dutch they also speak Spanish.  They speak a dialect called Papiamento but my family speaks English because my parents are from Guiana.  Guiana, I'd point to the map, is a small (laughs) country on the northeast coast of South America and though it's part of South America, it's not part of Latin America because Guiana is a British colony.  So people speak English and blah, blah, blah and Wisconsin is up here.  So I think that my parents [Wilhelmina Hill and Arthur Hughborn Mendes Bunyan] and I and my sisters gave a whole geography lesson to hundreds of people in southeastern Wisconsin.  And--
Speaker 2: You know I was going to say that with a map I, I--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.
Speaker 2: --there was a study once that showed that most American high school seniors could not identify Florida which actually sticks out--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --on the map.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And I would imagine that a lot of people in Wisconsin, high school students didn't--
Speaker 1: In the 1950s (laughs).
Speaker 2: In Wisconsin [unclear].
Speaker 1: (laughs) You're right, you're right.  And I also learned that it was my responsibility to present myself to people and not to anticipate what people think of me but to explain and to show people who I was.  And I think that has helped me over the years because in, in traveling and certainly in my work in, in journalism and in broadcasting and public speaking, I'm, I'm a conservative person physically.  I'm a conservative person intellectually but I believe that you have, in order to communicate with other people who have to show them and tell them who you are.  You can't expect them to read your mind, and that was a big gift from my father to me.  And I think it also helped me to be more assertive and to be more self-confident.
Story_ID: 36950
Speaker 1: My dad [Arthur Hughborn Mendes Bunyan] never had any fear of other people.  He never had any fear of speaking to anybody, walking up to anybody, going any place.  He never, ever was reticent to ask a question or to go where he thought he should go.  Nobody ever could make him think, oh you don't belong there.  You shouldn't ask that question.
Speaker 2: I know some of the people I've met I guess in colleges I guess that are from the Caribbean they have a high British accent I mean and presentation of themselves you know from that.  Did your father have that kind of--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.  His nickname was the Little General because he was about my height, a little taller (laughs), about 5'7", always slender never got, put on any weight, had the most incredible posture and walked around like, "here I am."  So he was, was my role model.  He was my real inspiration and guide and he also, what he also gave me was a sense of curiosity.  Because if you have curiosity and want to know what's going on that's one thing but what do you do with your curiosity.  How do you go and find out what's going on?  How do you go around the corner?  How do you talk to a person?  How do you travel?  What resources do you have to have in order to do that?  And one of the resources is you have to be, have to have self-confidence because if you're not confident in yourself why would you go and take a chance of going around that corner.  'Cause you don't know what's there.  It could hurt you.  It could help you.  You don't know but you have to have confidence to be able to say I'm going to go and do this anyway.  So that sort of ability to overcome anxiety and fear he, he really, really taught me that.  And I think part of it is also you know people, people who are immigrants have to overcome that; otherwise you wouldn't be an immigrant, you wouldn't move.  If you thought the world was entirely a hostile place and you were frightened of it, why would you get on a plane or boat and go thousands of miles away from your home.  You'd want to stay at your home where you think you know you're safe an, and where you know everything and know everybody.  So it's that sort of willingness and ability, internal ability to take a chance and to pursue that I think is so important and that's why I-I, I really believe the-the, the whole basis of this country, which is the immigrant spirit is so powerful and so important and has to be developed and continued and taken advantage of.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  Thank you.  Thank you for that.
Story_ID: 36951
Speaker 1: Now I want to take you back to Aruba and talk about growing up in Aruba and you, you were there until you were ten years [old], eleven right?
Speaker 2: Um hm, just before.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so what was it, was there a name for your neighborhood in Aruba?
Speaker 2: We lived in a community that was built by the oil refinery.  The oil refinery was called Lago Oil, L-A-G-O and as I said it was built of course by Standard Oil of New Jersey and it was essentially that community.  It was a company town.  (Laughs)  In the old spirit or style of so many places around the world and certainly in the United States, Standard Oil built everything around the refinery.  It built the community around the refinery.  It built the hospital.  It built the schools.  It built the roads.  It put in the infrastructure, the electrical system, the water system and it built homes.  So we lived in a neighborhood called Lago Heights, which was just outside the refinery and it was homes built specifically for people, for workers who worked in the refinery and their families and of course when I was a child these were brand new homes.  The homes are still there.
Speaker 1: Lago Heights.
Speaker 2: Lago Heights, yeah.
Speaker 1: Alright, okay.  This was a new [unclear].  What kind of home were built, brick or --
Speaker 2: Poured concrete.
Speaker 1: Concrete?
Speaker 2: Concrete, un huh.  And, and so they were bungalows essentially.  They were probably I think two bedrooms, small; small homes (laughs) and, and they were great for young families starting out.  And I remember--as I said my aunt and her family were just down the street and a lot of people from Guiana who were friends with my parents [Arthur Hughborn Mendes Bunyan and Wilhelmina Hill] settled in the same area.  As a matter of fact, the woman who was my godmother was from Guiana.  She died recently in Aruba at the age of 103.  She died about two years ago at the age of 103, Mrs. Taluk and her daughters babysat for me, with me and my sisters [Kathleen and Pamela Bunyan] (laughs) when we were small kids.  And so there was a lot of Guianese community people around there as well as others but there was a little enclave you know a block or two of Guianese families.  So people were very close and our whole social life was built around that.  My father was the founder of the first Boy Scout troop in Aruba.  He founded a Sea Scout troop.  My parents as you can, you probably figure out by now were involved in scouting in, in Guiana, my family.
Speaker 1: Sea Scout that's S-E-A, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: [unclear] Okay.
Speaker 2: And when I was a little girl I was the mascot of the Sea Scout troop.  So, because my dad had no boys, I would go with him to the meeting with the C Scouts and of course I was entranced with the big boys.  They were thirteen and fourteen years old and I would go with him to the beach and they would do their beach projects; cleaning up the beach and doing this kind of stuff.  I remember they built a little hut on the beach and I helped them build the hut.  I remember that because we, it was so exciting for you know an eight year old (laughs), nine year old.  And so I you know knew the beach and knew the, the area there and I saw my father a someone who also organized people and I also saw the value of people working together to get things done.  So those were, were some of the, you know very strong images that I saw as a, as a young girl.
Story_ID: 36952
Speaker 1: Now, this is one thing that we always ask and we ask it like this.  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well in Aruba of course the smell of the sea air, definitely that.  The sights for me besides near our house and my school, on the weekends we, you went to church and all Sunday was devoted to church. And then after church before you went home for dinner you'd go for a drive and my favorite drive was to drive to the airport.  Aruba had a tiny airport then of course and I used to go, I loved to go to the airport because I would go to the airport and we would sit outside the airport and watch the planes coming in and out.  And I would make up stories in my head about where the planes came from and who the people were coming off the planes and then when people would get on the planes and they would depart, I'd make up a story about who was on the plane and where they were going.  So I fell in love with airplanes and (laughs) airports and my favorite outing was to go to the airport to watch the planes.  We also had a lot of picnics on the beach and my other favorite thing was my godparents who were living close to us had a pet donkey.  Aruba at that time had wild donkeys; my godparents managed to tame a donkey and keep (laughs), keep it as a pet.  And my other favorite thing was to go to their home and after school and ride the donkey until it was time to go home and they would take me home.  So as a little girl those were my favorite things.
Speaker 1: So there were wild donkeys that, that you know lived on the islands [unclear] [simultaneous]?
Speaker 2: Yes, donkeys and goats.
Speaker 1: And wild goats?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not any more.  (Laughs)
Speaker 1: Yeah.  What, what happened?  What happened to them?
Speaker 2: People happened.  (Laughs)
Speaker 1: Oh people.  There are too many people?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  As, as the island got bigger and certainly with the advent of you know building roads and, and when the tourism industry came in in the late '60s (1960s) and early '70s (1970s), the donkeys died out and the goats.  Once in a while you'd see a goat.  I don't think there are any wild donkeys.  I think there is a donkey sanctuary where a few donkeys are being cared for (laughs) today.  But in those days in the '50s (1950s), '40s (1940s) and '50s (1950s) there were donkeys everywhere and goats everywhere and--
Speaker 1: Did people use them?  I mean I guess they used them at one time to carry items around [simultaneous]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, people, donkeys were used for transportation.
Speaker 1: Grinding grain probably.  I mean sugar cane.
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  Sugar wasn't grown, nothing was growing in Aruba.  Small--aloe was growing in Aruba but not sugar because Aruba is, has a climate that is considered, it is considered a very dry climate and it has no top soil.  It's a coral-based geology.  So there is very little soil.  So what grows there is cactus, aloe and a lot of low shrubs.  And also because Aruba is a low-lying island with a lot of wind, there are very few tall trees.
Story_ID: 36953
Speaker 1: What was the name of your church [in Aruba]?
Speaker 2: Oh gosh.  I knew our church.  You know, I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Was it Baptist or Episcopal--
Speaker 2: We were Episcopal.
Speaker 1: --or Anglican rather?
Speaker 2: Anglican, yes.
Speaker 1: Anglican?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And my, my school that I went to; I went to two schools.  The first school I went to was Peter Boor, P-E-T-E-R, B-O-O-R and then I went to Queen Julianna, J-U-L-I-A-N-N-A.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So Peter Boor was an elementary school?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was a low level school and then the Queen Julianna was a, oh I think it was fourth grade, fifth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Another thing I remember about Aruba too is my father [Arthur Hughborn Mendes Bunyan] got one of the first cars in Aruba.  In the early '40s (1940s) cars were, had begun being imported to Aruba and I believe my father got a car that was number 201 or something.  (Laughs)  And it was a big deal of course when you actually got your car because you had to order the car and pay for it before it was delivered to the island. So it was big deal and when we left the island in the '50s (1950s) my father gave the license tag, license plate to my uncle and my uncle gave the license plate to my-to his son and his son still has the license plate on the car.  [Simultaneous]
Speaker 1: [Unclear]
Speaker 2: So if you go to Aruba today, you can find (laughs) that license tag, all those years, 60, 70 years later.  Still the same license plate.
Speaker 1: But a different car?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  (Laughs)
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  So now did you have a favorite subject in or, or teacher in school?
Speaker 2: No I don't think so.  I had a favorite teacher.  Her name; I don't know what her first name was because we never knew our teachers' first names.  We just called them "Mvrouw."   Mvrouw is M-F-R--I'm sorry,  M-V-R-O-U-W and that's Dutch for "Mrs." or "Madame."  Mvrouw Durete.  Her name was spelled D-U-R-E-T-E and I think she was my favorite teacher.  Mvrouw Durete she was my favorite teacher and I must have been probably I think second or third grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think she was the teacher who figured out that I was nearsighted.
Story_ID: 36954
Speaker 1: Alright.  So we had you in school and now Queen Julianna School [Aruba] is like a, was it like a middle school I guess?
Speaker 2: Yes, lower middle school.
Speaker 1: Lower?
Speaker 2: Um hm, um hm.
Speaker 1: And so in the Dutch system, how does the Dutch system differ from say the American system, I mean to give people here a frame of reference?
Speaker 2: In those days, I can't talk about obviously what it's like now, but it was very strict and there, also you started school at a younger age than American kids.  I started first grade when I was four [years old] and the, there was, schools were extremely structured and very, very disciplined and you started out with language of course.  And I don't recall, how can I put this without being too patronizing, when we, when we moved from Aruba to the United States to Milwaukee for example I was, my, the school that we went, the first school that I went to in Milwaukee I believe I was in sixth grade; fifth grade, sixth grade.  I can't remember.
Speaker 1: [Unclear]
Speaker 2: I was, my parents [Arthur Hughborn Mendes Bunyan and Wilhelmina Hill] were told I was too young for that grade.  I had to go back, I had to be in the grade before because of my age and they said, "No, no no".  And the school said "Yes, yes, yes."  And they insisted that I be put at the same level of the school I left in Aruba.  So I was one year, almost a year younger than all of my classmates because I had started out a year earlier under the Dutch system in Aruba than my classmates had in Wisconsin.  So I graduated from high school a year, I was just seventeen whereas all my peers were eighteen.  So I was always a year younger.  For example in, in Wisconsin when I was, when the kids in my class were learning to drive, you had to be sixteen to get a license, I was only fifteen so I couldn't get my license.  I couldn't even take drivers' ed in school.  My father had to teach me to drive because I was too young to qualify for the drivers' ed class.
Story_ID: 36955
Speaker 1: So one thing was children were expected to start their education, their formal education, in the Dutch system earlier than American kids and I don't know what's going on now, but that's the way it was in Aruba.  Also the teachers, as I remember, they were so much more strict about everything than the schools that I went to when we moved to Wisconsin.  You behaved, you, every day you sang the national anthem before school.  We gathered in the spielplatz [sp.], which is the playground at the school.
Speaker 2: So this would be the Dutch national anthem?
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh yeah.  We sang the national anthem, you had the flag, you were very conscious of the Dutch royal family.  Queen Julianna School was named after Queen Julianna obviously.  You knew, I learned, her history.  I knew the history of the House of Orange, which was the royal house of, of the Netherlands.  You studied the geography of Holland.  You know I knew the, all the stories about how Amsterdam was founded and of course about the incredible empire that the Dutch had; all the positive things about it, of course not the negative things.  (Laughs) So history, geography and language were embedded in me in those primary school experiences.  And the way I can compare it is in the U.S. when we moved to the United States language wasn't so important; English, you know, struc-- grammar and those things were not as important.  Geography wasn't, didn't seem to be as important. Literature didn't seem to be as important and I know that part of my focus on these things was also because of my family being from Guiana and, and those arts.  The arts were important to my father's [Arthur Hughborn Mendes Bunyan] family; language, speaking, reading, literature were all important too but they seem to be very, very important in the Dutch system. And the great thing too about the Dutch system, at least as I recall it as a little girl, was I seemed to have gotten a more world view from the Dutch system than from the U.S. school systems and maybe that was because all the teachers at that time were from Holland.  There weren't local Aruban teachers.  There weren't, the teachers in the school were not the Nether--not from the Antilles.  They weren't from Latin America.  They were all Dutch women and perhaps because of that we, I felt more connected to Europe or to the international community.  So I'm not quite sure but I know as a child I felt that more like I was part of the whole world in Aruba.  I felt that way as opposed to Wisconsin where I felt like I was isolated you know in a little corner of the world.  So that's the kind of impression I got you know as, as a child that there was a big world out there.  I was in this little place but all the rest of that out there was still accessible to me and in Wisconsin I had this feeling I was in a big place but I was in a small corner of it and the big place really wasn't accessible to me.  So it was kind of reverse--
Speaker 2: [Unclear]--
Speaker 1: --kind of psychology.
Speaker 2: --to some of the students in Wisconsin you represented the rest of the world.  [Unclear]
Speaker 1: Yeah, probably, (laughs) probably.  So I really valued and I still tell my friends in Aruba I really valued those primary years in Aruba.  The primary education, because I learned good study habits, discipline, focus, the importance of school and the fact that it was the ticket to your future.  It wasn't just something you did because you had to but all the families valued it.  The entire--schools were very devoted to the children.  It was a very important part of one's life and the, the child existed to go to school and not, I mean playing was fun and everything else but life was not just having a great time playing in the yard.  It was sitting in the classroom and studying and learning and I--that's been a very important part of my life.  It's had a tremendous influence on my life.
Story_ID: 36956
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so you arrived here [United States] in 1957?
Speaker 2: '56 (1956).
Speaker 1: '56 (1956)?
Speaker 2: Um hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And now, so were you excited about coming to the United States?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't want to go.  (Laughs)  I didn't want to come.  I remember that I didn't want to come because I didn't want to leave my friends and I think I had a really big crush on some boy named Hanky, (laughs) and of course my mother's [Wilhelmina Hill] extended family but we came.  We moved to Milwaukee [Wisconsin] first.  We actually almost settled in Cuba.  One of the places my father [Arthur Hughborn Mendes Bunyan] had thought about going was Cuba; however the Cuban revolution was underway--
Speaker 1: I was going to say that.
Speaker 2: --and we decided not to go.  Our plane actually stopped in Havana [Cuba] on the way to Miami [Florida] and then to Wisconsin.  But I recall that very much because my, I remember my father talking about you know we, we, I thought about Cuba.  I really thought about Cuba but also because of the language.  We didn't know Spanish, my parents didn't know Spanish; so off to Milwaukee.  Of course we arrived in Milwaukee in the fall, at the start of the winter and had no conception of what that was about; big shock.  (Laughs)
Speaker 1: It gets cold in Milwaukee and Wisconsin.
Speaker 2: Yes, big shock.  My mother had to go out and find coats for us.  It was a big, big surprise; big shock.
Speaker 1: Did you; well you had at least got a chance to see the weather change from cool to cold, so you knew it would change back.
Speaker 2: (Laughs) Yes.  And I think the other thing that was a big surprise of course for my family is that we were very isolated.  The first few years while we were getting settled I think my mother was extremely homesick.  I think she missed her family and you must remember of course the only way you could communicate with people was by mail.  And I remember when letters would come from my uncles and people would send pictures and then we would send pictures back to Guiana or to Aruba.  And I remember distinctly the Christmas cards because everybody sent Christmas cards and with long messages in them and the beautiful cards with the padding and we'd get cards from Guiana with snow on them.  (Laughs)  Because those were the only kind of Christmas cards you could find.  They all were made in England and so you'd get cards from the deep tropics with pictures of mountains with snow on them and Christmas trees with snow on them and stuff.  So my mother I know missed her culture very, very much.  She tried to cook some Guianese food which was very hard because you couldn't get the ingredients.  My cousins and some of my uncles came to visit us in, in Wisconsin and they would bring food of course, some of the Guianese food.  It was just sort of other worldly kind of experience you know knowing that your family came from the tropics, knowing sort of the warmth of the culture and then living in a place where you have to shovel yourself out (laughs) to get out of the house and where people were; you know not that people weren't nice but it was the culture in southeastern Wisconsin was people of Polish and German descent.  And so their food was much different than ours, their language was much different, their orientation was much different and of course then we were not the same color.  So we were different.
Story_ID: 36957
Speaker 1: Did you, did you make any friends in school.  Now you're in this little town which is not too far from Milwaukee [Wisconsin], Muskego [Wisconsin] [unclear].  It wasn't Milwaukee.
Speaker 2: No, no and it was the countryside.  In the '50s (1950s) it was the countryside; now it's of course the suburbs basically but it was the countryside.  So going to Milwaukee was a big trip.  No in high school I had a lot of good friends and I also had very good teachers I will say that, and good neighbors because this was the period when my mother [Wilhelmina Hill] had gotten ill and I was very depressed in high school because my mother was sick.  And I think without the help of some, my teachers and neighbors I don't know how I would have gotten through.  The neighbor who lived right behind us, Mrs. Schaffer used to cook for us and bring meals over to us when my mother was very, very sick because she couldn't cook.  I had a wonderful high school teacher, Mr. Batha, who, for whom I babysat and he and his wife were really comforting to me when my mother was very sick and dying.  And as a matter of fact I was baby -- the night she died I was actually babysitting for my science teacher and his family.  And so we did have, I did have support from my teachers and I had very nice girlfriends.
Story_ID: 36958
Speaker 1: I didn't, I didn't have the social life that they [Bunyan's girlfriends in Muskego, Wisconsin] had.  I never dated, didn't have a boyfriend in high school and this was the time when you know rock and roll was just getting started but boys didn't ask me out and I remember distinctly going to a couple of school dances and I sat on the sidelines.  I didn't like that.  Nobody would ever ask me to dance and I knew it was because I was black and so I recall saying to myself many, many times I'm not going to put myself in a position of ever, ever of being tacitly rejected by people.  I will not play a passive role.  I have to be an active person.  I can't sit back and wait for people to come to me.  I have to go to them.  And a lot of that was because I didn't really participate in the social, that kind of social life.  Now I participated in the organizations in school, in my high school.  I helped to create the literary magazine.  I helped to, the establish the newspaper, the school newspaper.  I helped to create the school pep club and we were in a high school that was brand new.  So I did take a leadership position--
Speaker 2: Now what was the name of your high school?
Speaker 1: Muskego High School, M-U-S-K-E-G-O.
Speaker 2: Okay, Muskego High School.  Okay.  So the news, the school newspaper--
Speaker 1: Um hm.
Speaker 2: --and you said the literary club?
Speaker 1: The literary magazine.
Speaker 2: The literary magazine.
Speaker 1: The pep club (laughs), the Latin Club.  I was in the Latin Club and I was also one of the star debaters and public speakers.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Did, did the school have a little radio station or--
Speaker 1: No, no, no.
Speaker 2: --nothing like that.
Speaker 1: No, no, no.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Everything-- [simultaneous]
Speaker 2: So you didn't really get a chance to be in the media.
Speaker 1: Oh no, no.  It was newspapers, newspapers.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I loved working with the newspaper.  I loved going to the printer and watching him print the papers.  I loved going on debating trips.  I did a lot of extemporaneous speaking, public speaking.  I had a wonderful coach and--Mrs. Katzor (laughs), K-A-T-Z-O-R.  I think she is still alive and I was her star pupil.  And I thank her every day of my life because she saw that I had talent and that I was quick on my feet and she pushed me and she helped me to win contests and she helped me also, I won a contest at the American Legion Post in Milwaukee.  They had a, I think it was a Fourth of July speech contest and the theme was why I am glad to be an American and I wrote a speech, my little speech and I went to the Foreign Legion Post.  I remember it's in a building on Lake Michigan and of course the Foreign, the American Foreign Legion was composed of men who were veterans of World War II, at that time veterans of the Korean War, well the Korean War was still going on, and they were all white men.  And I got up in front of all these middle-aged white men and gave a speech about being an immigrant and coming to the United States and blah, blah.  And I won first prize and I got $100.
Speaker 2: Pretty good.
Speaker 1: And, oh yeah.  In 1960 (laughs), I mean that was pretty good.
Speaker 2: That's a week's salary for a lot of people in those days, $100.
Speaker 1: (Laughs) I know I remember thinking, "This is great!  I can stand up in front of people and speak and they'll pay me."  So that stuck in my mind for a while (laughs) but Mrs. Katzor and the other folks there really, really were very, very supportive of me.
Story_ID: 36959
Speaker 1: So when you were a senior in high school now how were your grades?  I imagine you had good grades.
Speaker 2: You know I had pretty good grades but when my mother [Wilhelmina Hill] got sick I was very depressed.  And I also had a lot of stress because I was helping to take care of my mother and keep our family in one piece and I knew that my father [Arthur Hughborn Mendes Bunyan] really depended on me.  So my grades went down but I managed to graduate.  I was--I hoped to graduate in the top three of my class.  I graduated in the top ten.  I think I was number nine and that was a huge disappointment to me.  And my father I knew expected me to graduate in the top three but he was very understanding.  And I really don't know, I don't, I'm surprised I graduated in the top ten to tell you the truth because I was extremely depressed.  My graduating class was probably about 120 people I think.  But it was a big struggle.  Those years were a big struggle for everybody in my family.  As I said, my mother was sick for three years.  She had a double mastectomy.  She really suffered a lot.  In those days when people got cancer of course it was considered a death sentence and also there was a lot of anxiety about cancer.  The attitude towards cancer today is completely different.  But in the '50s (1950s) if you had cancer people thought it was contagious.  A lot of people thought that if you touched somebody with cancer you'd get it.  So people who had cancer were kind of you know shunned.  She was a nurse so she knew how sick she was and she had also worked in the hospital where she was being cared for.  So the good thing about that was that she knew people in the hospital.  But two things happened in, in my family.  One was the cost of her care; my father's insurance couldn't pay for it so my father had to go out-of-pocket to pay for it.  He, we almost lost our house. I remember a couple of times when my dad could not pay the heating bill and the electric bill.  And I remember a couple of those times because they were in the winter and in our little house in, in Muskego [Wisconsin] we had no heat and we would sleep on the floor in our sleeping bags to keep warm and we had to be very careful about how we spent money.  Not that we spent any money to begin with but my dad had to be very, very careful.  So we had a huge financial strain because of my mother's illness and I always thought, I still think to this day, you have to have insurance.  I mean we had insurance but the insurance; the hospital costs were much further than the insurance.  So my family actually almost went under because of the cost of taking care of somebody with an illness.  So today in 19--, in 2012 when we talk about medical care and insurance and blah, blah, blah, I know from personal experience what that can do; what the cost of being sick can do to a family.
Story_ID: 36960
Speaker 1: The other thing was dealing with emotional distress of it.  Because from the age of twelve to, when my mother [Wilhelmina Hill] was first diagnosed, I had to deal with my mother's fear, her physical illness, her emotional fear.  And we had many talks about how the girls, my sisters [Kathleen and Pamela Bunyan] and I were going to take care of ourselves after she was gone because she knew she was dying and how much she, and she would talk about what she wanted us to do and how she wanted us to grow up and this was all without any support.  There was no American Cancer Society and you know all these groups running around here helping you.  So we were very, very isolated and really became self, became dependent on, on each other and I learned when I, from early, at that age I've got to think for myself.  I have to think for myself and I have to figure out how to get through to the next day.  And I studied, my father [Arthur Hughborn Mendes Bunyan] and I both, studied grief, how to deal with loss and we, my father and I both, did a lot of religious study during that period to figure out you know why was this happening to us, why did God allow this to happen and so we did a lot of deep (laughs) thinking and talking.  And so I developed a sense very early that you have to explore your inner, inner life in order to survive the outer life.
Speaker 2: How did your sisters fare [unclear]?
Speaker 1: They, they were both, they were both depressed too.  I think they were less, they were more, how can I put it, they didn't realize as much as I did what was happening and because they were younger they didn't have the chance to do the sort of intellectual search that I did.  And so I think that they, for them maybe the loss was even bigger than it was for me because I was able to sort of build my own little world to help myself through the experience.  For them it was even harder.  And the impact on their lives, the impact on my life first was I became very self-sufficient.  And the impact on their lives I think were they became self-sufficient but also fearful and I had, I was fearful too.  I'm not saying I was just you know some kind of bold (laughs), bold person but I think for them they were, they were more fragile.  And my middle sister Kathleen she, she did incredibly well.  She went to work right after high school and then she went back to school.  She worked her way through college and got a master's degree at Northwestern [University].  My younger sister left high school, did not go to college but got married and had a child and became a housewife.  But it was a bad, bad experience for all of us.  It was a very, very tough experience.
Story_ID: 36961
Speaker 1: [Unclear] That's a lot of change compressed into a short period of time.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and it was very hard on my father [Arthur Hughborn Mendes Bunyan]; very, very hard because here he was a man with three girls in the middle of nowhere basically and trying to do so much.  So it was very hard.  The, I really think that the depression and the stress affected me physically and I, I might, I think about, I think my mother's [Wilhelmina Hill] side of the family always had a bit of depression in the family but I think the experience of losing my mother and going through that I really think it changed some of my body chemistry.  And after studying depression and studying you know these things over the years I came, I think I came to understand or I think I've come to understand the significance of stress on the body.  And after that, after my mother had died and as I got older in my twenties, I realized that I was an anxious person.  I realized that I was prone to depression and I knew exactly when it would start and I also fortunately learned how to manage it and I found out while my mother was sick that one of the ways to manage it was with exercise and music.  So and fortunately my father was a music lover and we grew up with lots of music and I credit music with helping me through my mother's (laughs) illness and death.
Speaker 1: What kind of music specifically?
Speaker 2: Classical music and rock and roll (laughs), both.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Classical music too because my father was a lover of classical music.  Classical music affected me in that it calmed me.  It caused me to meditate and to become introspective.  Handel, Beethoven, Bach and of course a lot of church music, a lot of and then rock and roll because rock and roll was coming into existence during my, when I was in high school.  Rock and roll helped lift my spirit.
Speaker 1: Yeah that was the age of Chuck Berry and Elvis--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --Presley--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and Fats Domino.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Rock and roll you, you wanted to dance.  You know when you dance, you release the endorphins.  You felt good.  And so I would listen to the classical music to calm myself if I was really anxious and then I would listen to rock and roll to get myself energized.
Speaker 1: Now did you have a favorite rock and roll --
Speaker 2: Oh my goodness.  Well living in an all-white community all the white artists of course that were big at that time: the Everly Brothers, Elvis of course and then the black artists as I got older.  I think probably, I loved Little Richard (laughs) and Chuck Berry of course.  I think those were my favorites.  They were my favorites.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 36962
Speaker 1: You know I'd mentioned that my father [Arthur Hughborn Mendes Bunyan] had such a big impact on my life and one of the very important things that he did to me was he taught me how to ask questions of myself; how to be introspective.  And when my mother [Wilhelmina Hill] was sick and then after she died my father and I went on a little journey, a little spiritual journey together; which I think was unique for young people and, and their parents.  I was raised in the Anglican Church and the Episcopal Church and my parents, both of them were very devoted to the Anglican Church.  After my mother died my father had a crisis of faith and he, I guess the best way to put it that he was distressed that he could not find answers to his questions, spiritual questions.  He couldn't find the answers in the Episcopal Church, from the Episcopal Church.  I remember going with him to talk to our priest, our minister in the little church that we went to.  It was St. David's Church in Muskego [Wisconsin].  And sitting with my father and the minister talking about my mother's death and the impact and what lessons we were learning and how God was at work in this process and after that my dad decided to explore other religious values.  And for about I think two years he consistently and methodically looked at other religions, other world religions outside of Christianity and outside of, obviously outside of the Episcopal Church.  And he sort of took me with him on (laughs) this quest because I was the big girl and so I sat with him at and went with him when he literally went to different churches; went to different places around Wisconsin.  And also he read about world religions because coming from you know Guiana, the Episcopal, the Anglican Church was it.  Coming from, be living in Wisconsin of course the Christian church was it.  And my dad and I studied everything from Zoroastrianism to Islam to Confucianism to Lutheranism, you know within the Christian faith and we really looked at world religions.  My father found a place where he felt comfortable and that place was in the Baha'i faith and I don't recall exactly how that happened but I do recall going with him to meetings at the Baha'i Temple in Wilmette, Illinois.  Wilmette is just outside Chicago [Illinois].
Story_ID: 36963
Speaker 1: And I do recall and I still have his [Bunyan's father, Arthur Hughborn Mendes Bunyan] books about the Baha'i faith.  The Baha'i faith was founded in the mid-1800s by an Iranian holy man named Baha'u'llah and the Baha'i faith essentially was an offshoot of Islam and the Baha'is in Iran were considered renegades from the Islamic faith and they were shunned and they were rejected and they were actually persecuted.  But they grew anyway and they spread around the world and the tenet, the basic tenets of the Baha'i faith, and the reason why they appeal, the Baha'i faith appealed to my dad were the Baha'i faith believed of course in one god, very important.  Also they believed that god has sent prophets, people throughout the ages to humanity to help us find our way and that Moses was a prophet, Jesus was a prophet, Baha'u'llah was a prophet and that the founders of the major religions were all people who were prophets.  David was a prophet.  And that the important thing was not who the prophet was, but it was what the value of their teaching was and that each of those prophets from all the religious faiths brought value.  So that in the Baha'i faith although Baha'u'llah is revered but not in the same way that Moses or David is revered or Jesus.  The Baha'i faith studies world religions.  Baha'i faith also has an international value system.  It believes in a world language.  It believes in international justice.  It believes in equality of all people and it believes that we have to work to create governments all around the world that are equitable and just and fair.  And it is not a politically oriented religion.  Also the Baha'i faith has very, very little hierarchical structure.  It doesn't have a Pope.  It doesn't have a priest per se that is teacher.  And my father found this very appealing.  So he became a member of the Baha'i faith.  Also in the Baha'i faith you cannot be born into the Baha'i faith.  You have to be taught.  And you cannot become a member of the Baha'i faith until you're eighteen years old.  So you don't automatically become a member of the Baha'i faith because your parents are.  So he liked the fact that you had to explore where you were going before you got there.  And so he became a Baha'i and for the rest of his life he was a practicing Baha'i.  He was able to go to Haifa.  The Baha'is also have a beautiful temple in Haifa, Israel and he was able to go to Haifa and of course to Wilmette and I went to Wilmette with him several times in Illinois.  And the Baha'i, the members of the Baha'i faith also were extremely diverse people.  You will find African Americans, Asian Americans (laughs), white Americans and it's a very small group of people but you will find they're extremely inter-cultural and their values are completely inclusive.  So he found great comfort in this and I have never become a Baha'i but I really, really appreciate their value system and I identify very much with it in my own life.  But this I think helped my father through an incredible crisis and--
Speaker 2: Did you remain an Anglican yourself or--
Speaker 1: Well, yeah.  I mean I don't (laughs) go to church (laughs).  I go to the cathedral once in a while (laughs), the Washington Cathedral.  But I know the Anglican liturgy, I know the (laughs), I know the whole game so to speak.  I'm not observant.  I don't observe.  But I never, I can't say I didn't, I stopped, I stopped going to church.  I really, I did but I appreciate and respect the Anglican Church, the Episcopal Church and I appreciate and respect Christianity but I also appreciate and respect the fact that having faith in a higher power is a cultural as well as a spiritual journey.  And that when you make the journey you can make it within your own culture or you can make it within another culture but you have to learn what those other cultures are.  And it's very important not to reject the other cultures and the way in which people of those cultures make their journeys.  So I, I have great respect for all of the ways in which people of other cultures pursue their spirituality.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 36964
Speaker 1: Okay now in, as a senior in high school [Muskego High School, Wisconsin] with all this having gone on and what, what were your prospects of college?  You, you, I know you were thinking about what college you might want to attend.  Did you have good counseling?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was expected to go on to college and what happened to me was I applied for college at a small school in upstate Wisconsin.  At that time was part of the Wisconsin State College System.  The college was in Eau Claire, Wisconsin and Eau Claire, Wisconsin is about from Milwaukee [Wisconsin] area probably about 400 miles I think.  So I applied and got into Eau Claire and in the fall of '62 (1962) I was supposed to go to Eau Claire.  In the summer of '62' (1962) I was waiting for my assignment for housing because at that time it was required that all freshman, I believe freshman and sophomore women had to live on campus.  And by late August I think I had not received my housing assignment and I had a very good friend in high school who was also going to Eau Claire, a white girl and she had received her housing assignment.  So I got concerned and I called the Dean of Women at Eau Claire State College and I asked you know can you tell me where I'm going to live; what dormitory am I going to live in.  And she told me on the phone that I wasn't going to live in the dormitory that I was going to, she was going to find off-campus housing for me. And I said why.  And she said, "Because the other girls in the dormitory aren't ready for you"; quote, unquote.  And I said, "Ready for me?" and she said "Yes, they're not ready for you."  So I told my father [Arthur Hughborn Mendes Bunyan] and you know he figured out pretty quickly what that meant.  My dad and I went to my high school principal and told him, "Maureen's been told she can't live on campus with the girls, other girls at Eau Claire because they're not ready for her.  Apparently because she's not the same color as they are."  My principal got on the phone in front of my dad and me and called the Dean of Women and said, Dean So and So I have a young woman here with me who is interested in going to your college but I don't know, what's the requirement where she lives.  Does she have to live in the dormitory or could she live outside the dormitory?  The Dean of Women told Mr. Halstaad [sp.], my high school principal, oh the state law says she must live in the dormitory.  And he said, "Well that's very strange because this young woman, Maureen Bunyan, told me that you told her that she could not live in the dormitory."  "Oh that must have been a mistake."  Well, I was so ticked off and my father was not happy.  I went to Eau Claire, moved up to Eau Claire and went the first two days, two nights I think it was, I lived, I went to a hotel.  Went to the Dean of Women's Office the first thing I could.  I went to her and said, "I'm Maureen Bunyan.  We had a conversation on the phone and you told me I wasn't to live in the dormitory because the students weren't ready for me and what would you like me to do?"  And she said, "Well, we're going to put you in the dormitory.  I've found a place for you."  I said, "Well, I don't think I'm ready to go and live in the dormitory."  And I told her I wasn't going to live in the dormitory because if they weren't going to have me, I wasn't going to have them.
Story_ID: 36965
Speaker 1: So I moved in, probably two weeks after I moved to Eau Claire [State College, Eau Claire, Wisconsin]. I was taking a class with a, a German language class, with a woman from Bavaria who had just moved to Eau Claire.  She and I made friends.  My German was pretty good because I'd studied in high school.  And I told her what had happened to me and she said why don't you come and live with me.  My niece has just come from Bavaria and she wants to learn English.  You and she can live together in the attic of my house and you can live for free for room and board if you help her clean the house.  I move in with Constantia, her niece.  We lived in the attic, we roomed together and in exchange I dusted the house and helped in the housekeeping.  Two things happened:  One was I defied the Dean of Women.  I established the fact that I was not going to be pushed around by whatever their rules are because their rules weren't just.  And second, I took advantage of an opportunity.  So I was able to live in this woman's house, practice my German, be taken care of and live nicely and tell the "Establishment" you know what you can do.  (Laughs)  So to me that was a great learning experience.  First, because I was always, I think my, my, I know my father and my parents [father and mother, Wilhelmina Hill] imbued this in me.  People should not be abused.  And in our family we don't take abuse if we're conscious of it.  Now if we are not conscious of it, fine but it is not acceptable to be abused.  And I felt I was being abused by that school.  However, there is always an opportunity and if you insist on being treated properly, you will find the opportunities.  If you instead say I hate you because you abused me or because you did this bad thing to me and I'm gonna spend the rest of my life getting back at you, you're not going to go anywhere.  But if you say, "Hmmm, okay.  I'm being rejected here.  But you know what, for every one rejection, there are ten other acceptances over here.  It's my job to go find out what those acceptances are."  And that experience in Eau Claire taught me I guess you know to make good out of something that I thought was bad.  I had a wonderful experience living with this family.  As a matter of fact, two years later when I ran away from home, I went to Germany and I met--
Speaker 2: Wait a minute.  We're skipping over a significant--
Speaker 1: I know, I know.  (Laughs)
Speaker 2: --[unclear] area.  Okay.
Speaker 1: I went to live with this girl and her family and with some other friends of mine in Germany.  I spent eight months in Germany but that's two years later.  But that was my first experience, first real experience with racial discrimination in the United States and this was in 1962-63.
Speaker 2: So this is Eau Claire; what, what's it called?
Speaker 1: Eau Claire.
Speaker 2: Oh Eau Claire College?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Eau Claire College.
Speaker 1: The second semester --
Speaker 2: And that's spelled --
Speaker 1: Eau Claire.  Eau Claire I think is about thiry miles east of Minneapolis/St. Paul [Minnesota].  And again there was one other girl, one other black girl.  There was a girl from Racine [Wisconsin] who also was in the school and she and I were the only two black girls in, in the school.  At that time I think the school enrollment was about 5,000.  And there was a guy from Nigeria, there was a guy from Kenya, there was a woman from Tokyo [Japan], a young woman from Tokyo and there was a Spanish girl from, a Mexican girl and there was a Chinese girl, and the reason that I remember all that because we were the only non-white students in the entire campus and we were shunned.  We literally ate all our lunches together, our dinners together.  That was it.
Speaker 2: So you all actually made a group of your own.
Speaker 1: We integrated the school.  We basically integrated the school.  And there was one Jewish kid from the Bronx [New York], Jewish American kid.  So we were you know may be at the most ten people on a campus of about 5,000 who were not white.  And there was no overt you know kind of stuff.  It was just nobody--people didn't talk to us.  You know we--I'm sure if we'd fallen over dead on the sidewalk, people would have walked over us.
Story_ID: 36966
Speaker 1: The second semester at Eau Claire [State College, Eau Claire, Wisconsin] I roomed with the Chinese girl, Jenny Chin.  She and I roomed together.  We both decided that we couldn't stand being at Eau Claire so instead of staying there for the second semester for our sophomore year we moved to Milwaukee [Wisconsin].  And we moved into the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association] in Milwaukee and we lived in the YWCA for about eight months.  She went to school.  I took a job at the electric company in Milwaukee and we got thrown out of the YWCA when they found out that we were cooking in our room because we weren't supposed to cook.  All we were cooking was rice.  We ate rice for about three months.
Speaker 2: Now did your dad [Arthur Hughborn Mendes Bunyan] know that you left school?  I mean did you--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah?  So he knew you left.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, so you basically dropped out Eau Claire and--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --moved to Milwaukee.
Speaker 1: Um hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I worked.  I don't think I went back to school that year.  I worked; I worked for about two years at the electric company.  (Laughs)  I went back to school in Wisc--in Milwaukee, UWM [University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee].  I worked part time, both at the electric company as well as at Allen-Bradley and a couple of other manufacturing companies doing clerical work.  And I worked through college about 300 different jobs.
Speaker 2: Okay.  This is 1963 right?
Speaker 1: '63 (1963) to '65 (1965)
Speaker 2: Okay, '63 (1963) to '65 (1965).  Alright so you did like go back to school.  You went to--
Speaker 1: Part-time, yeah.
Speaker 2: UWM [University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee]?
Speaker 1: Um hm.
Speaker 2: Now what was your career objective?  Did you, had you targeted journalism [unclear]
Speaker 1: Not really, not really.  I was very interested in languages and psychology.  I didn't have a journalism career in mind.  A little bit later on I did, but basically it was in print journalism not television, not broadcasting.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I'm trying to think now were there very many women on television in those days that you could, would have been a role model as an anchor or; I can't think of any [simultaneous]--
Speaker 1: I don't think, I don't think there in in, certainly not in Milwaukee [Wisconsin].  Nationally all I remember was there were a few women maybe on some of the networks but no, no, not too many.  I remember the 'Today Show' [simultaneous] --
Speaker 2: Today Show [unclear]
Speaker 1: --had Pauline Kael.  She used to do arts and movie reviews for NBC [simultaneous] --
Speaker 2: Someone had Bess Myerson right?
Speaker 1: Bess Myerson also was on the Today Show, yeah, very, very few, very few.  But I wasn't interested in television, no, not at all.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 36967
Speaker 1: You want to know why I ran away from home?
Speaker 2: Yes I do.
Speaker 1: (laughs)
Speaker 2: I do want to know why you ran; now, now, well does this represent--I guess I don't, I'm confused now because you're at, you're at Eau Claire [State College, Eau Claire, Wisconsin] and then you, you and the Chinese young lady moved to--
Speaker 1: Milwaukee [Wisconsin].
Speaker 2: --Milwaukee.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now you're not at home, you're in [unclear]--
Speaker 1: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 2: And then so, so then how do you get back home I guess to run away from it?  That's want I, I don't understand.
Speaker 1: Well I, in, I was in school [University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee] part-time and I was working part-time and in the end of 1964 I was I think, I think I had gone back to live in Muskego [Wisconsin] in, with my sisters [Kathleen and Pamela Bunyan] but I was not happy.  I think I was still depressed and in the end of '64 (1964) and I had been in, been taking some classes as I told you at UWM, no longer at the Y [YWCA' Young Women's Christian Association] (laughs) a I decided at the end of '64 (1964) I needed to see the world.  And I think it was my you know time of, what do you call it, you know when young people decide they're gotta break with the family; you know, the coming of age thing.  And of course you must remember that this was also the time when there was a huge international movement.  Vietnam [war] was underway, there was the women's movement going on, the civil rights movement was going on and for the first time you know young people in this country and all around the world had a voice.  And we young people were at the forefront of all the social change going on, not only in the U.S. but all over the world.  And I had been dating, as a matter of fact, I had dated one friend of mine, a guy from New York and he said that he wanted to go to Europe.  So I said I'll go with you.  And this was when it was okay to be a hippie and to sort of live on the streets.  (Laughs)  We took a student ship, this was a reconfigured oil tanker and essentially they put bunk beds in this oil tanker and for $500 you could get a round trip to Europe.  Now we got on this oil tanker in New York with our clothes and a couple of you know other belongings, and went to L' Arve [sp.], France and then from there we went to Paris [France] and we hitchhiked.  We hitchhiked around France and we hitchhiked around the Netherlands and then when we were in the Netherlands I decided that I wanted to go to Germany to visit my friends that I had met when I was in college [Eau Claire State College] and he said he didn't want to go to Germany because he was Jewish.  We broke up.  I hitchhiked to Munich [Germany] and Bavaria and then went to Frankfurt and found some friends who lived outside of Frankfurt near Wiesbaden in a little town called Eltville [sp.] and walked up to their door unannounced and said I'm here.  (Laughs)  They took me in.  Their daughter had been an exchange student at my high school in Wisconsin and she and I had made friends when we were teenagers.  And this family literally took me in.  I lived with them for about five months, six months.  The parents only spoke German.  They were like my parents.  They were wonderful, sweet people.
Story_ID: 36968
Speaker 1: I got a job in Wiesbaden [Germany]; couple of jobs in Wiesbaden, including one at the Air Force base, U.S. Air Force base in Wiesbaden.  I also got a job at a Mercedes Benz dealer in Wiesbaden because this was when Americans were beginning to buy Mercedes cars and they would fly to Germany to the Mercedes company or to the dealer and they would choose the car and then the car would be shipped back to the U.S.  But when the Americans came they didn't speak English, German and the German sales people couldn't speak English and they hired me as an interpreter.  So when the Americans would come in to buy a car, I would talk to them in English about the car and then I would explain to the German sales person, salesman; vice versa.  So I helped sell Mercedes cars for several months.  At the U.S. Air Force base I worked essentially as a clerk and I had; the Air Force base was segregated, racially segregated and--
Speaker 2: But this was 1964--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and this is the United States Air Force base--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in Germany.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.
Speaker 2: And it was segregated.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  The housing was segregated.  I never lived in the housing but the black soldiers and their families lived one place, the whites and their families lived in another place.
Speaker 2: They say that the U.S. military was integrated in 1948 but--
Speaker 1: Well on paper maybe.
Speaker 2: Not fully, not fully in [unclear].
Speaker 1: No, no, no.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: No, no, no and even after you know the laws were passed and you know people like Cliff Alexander [Clifford Alexander. Jr.; first African American Secretary of the Army] did so much getting it into reality was a different story.  There was resistance and I know about that because I saw it there.  And I worked with a man, my boss was a man from Alabama or Mississippi or somewhere, a white guy and I could still see his face.  He didn't want me to work there.  He didn't want me working in his office and he did not make life easy for me.  I think I worked there for about four or five months but he had an attitude that I didn't belong there because I was black and nothing else.  He didn't, my ability, my background; zero.  I was the wrong color because this was a segregated place.  So that was part of my experience in Germany.  And then I also hiked, hitchhiked to Scandinavian countries, then I went to Spain and stayed in Spain for about a month or so.  Ran out of money, had many adventures, came home, got back to New York.  I literally had a dime in my purse when I got to New York.  I had to call my ex-boyfriend who was back in New York by that time and ask him to come and pick me up at the airport because I had no money for a taxicab.  Then I had to call my father [Arthur Hughborn Mendes Bunyan] and beg him to send me money for a plane from New York to Milwaukee [Wisconsin].  My father wasn't happy (laughs) with me.  He thought I had lost my mind first, because I left and second, because I didn't communicate with him when I was gone.  So God knows what he thought I was doing and what kind of trouble I was in.  But I'll tell you it was a very important part of my life because I was able to function everywhere I went.  People were decent to me.  I felt free.  You know, I hitchhiked on the Autobahn. I, I lived in; I slept in the train station.  (Laughs)  It was and, and, and there were other people doing it.  There were other young people doing it and so it was just a great liberating kind of experience.  So I--it helped me to grow up too, it helped me to really grow up.
Story_ID: 36969
Speaker 1: Okay, so, all right, so you come back [to Wisconsin from Europe], and, well, I know your father [Arthur Hughborn Mendes Bunyan] was relieved that you were alive and--
Speaker 2: He was, he was, yeah, yeah.  And he also wanted me to settle down and go back to school, which I did.  So I came back, I believe it was the end of '65 [1965].  And I did go back to school.  I went back to UWM, University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, and my father, of course, was in school too at the same time, going to college (laughter) at the same time I was.
Speaker 1: At the same school?
Speaker 2: No, he was going, I think he was going to Stout [University of Wisconsin-Stout] at that time or maybe Milwaukee Area Technical College.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's right.
Speaker 2: When I got back to Wisconsin, I also realized that the Civil Rights Movement was underway in a big way, and I re-enrolled at the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, and I was thrown into the whole Black Power Movement.
Speaker 1: Now, what do you mean by that?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) On the campus, there was a small group of black students, not huge numbers, of course, but very, very--probably, like every college campus around the country, who were organizing.  A Black Student Union had been created.  Milwaukee, itself, was very divided.  It was at that time a very segregated city, and most of the students who went to UWM were from Milwaukee.  Milwaukee, because it--the housing was so segregated, Milwaukee had a very strong open housing movement.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Vel Phillips was one of the (unclear) housing movement (unclear), one of the (unclear) leaders.
Speaker 2: And, of course, students all over the--university students all over the world, and certainly all over this country were involved in demonstrations against racial segregation, against Vietnam [war].  And I wanted to be a part of it.  But I also realized that I did not know enough about black American culture to understand what was happening.  So I decided to read as much as I could and to hang around as much as I could with the quote "militants," unquote (laughter), to find out what this was all about.  In the process of doing that, I joined the Black Student Union.  There was a black theater group.  I joined that and several other organizations.
Speaker 1: Was the theater group associated with the school or was it--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  And I met Cheston Everett.  Cheston Everett was the director of the black theater group.  Cheston Everett was Ron Karenga's older brother.  So I learned about Ron Karenga, met him, as a matter of fact.  He came to Milwaukee.  I made friends with several of the people who were leading the opening housing movement, Father Groppi, Jimmy Givings--I don't know if you know those names.
Speaker 1: Father Groppi is a famous, yeah--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Catholic priest who really led the opening housing movement there.
Story_ID: 36970
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about Father Groppi and Jimmy Givings?
Speaker 2: Father Groppi was a Catholic priest who was extremely socially conscious, and he worked in the inner city [Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  He was white, I believe he was German, I think he was German or Polish descent.  And he essentially, focused the city and especially the media and various civic organizations and the Catholic church on this issue of racial segregation.  And segregation, of course, was house--based on housing and therefore, the school systems in Milwaukee.  And he led dozens and dozens of marches.  He challenged landlords.  He challenged the city government.  He challenged the media to report on these things, on these issues in Milwaukee.  Jimmy Givings was a, I guess you would call him a Black Power leader in Milwaukee.  He was a community organizer.  He was the head of a neighborhood group called "Northcott Neighborhood House" which was in the black community in Milwaukee.  And basically, I called Jimmy up, I called Father Groppi up, and a couple other people, and I said, I want to know who you are (laughter) and what you're doing.  And I met them and talked to them and found out what they were doing.  And I also--the other thing I learned besides that I didn't know much about black Americans and black American history, I learned that--I learned how insidious racism was in this country, how deeply imbedded it was.  I learned how important it was to be a part of the movement, and I also learned the power of the media because I read the newspapers, 'The Milwaukee Journal' and at that time 'The Milwaukee Sentinel' and I realized that in order to change society, you had to be a part of it.  You had to be in it, and you had to be out of it at the same time.  You had to be in it, taking part in whatever it was, other people were doing, helping to change, but you also had to be able to step back and observe it, and I thought, you know, I like being in it, but I think I like observing it too.  And that sort of got me started toward my career in media because I realized that one of the only ways in which you could observe and still have an impact was as a journalist.  I didn't want to be a, you know, a Father Groppi.  I didn't wanna be a, a civil rights leader.  But I wanted to study them, and I wanted to see what they were doing, and I wanted to tell other people about it.  So that piqued my interests in journalism.  And so, as luck would have it, I went to work for the Social Development Commission, which was the, part of the anti-poverty movement, the federal anti-poverty movement, and part of my, one of my jobs at the Social Development Commission in Milwaukee was to run a small student newspaper for high school kids in the inner city.  And I was the editor of this little paper, and I hired, quote, unquote, "half a dozen teenagers from different schools."  And we put this paper out in the summer of 1967 and the summer of 1968.
Speaker 1: What was the name of it?
Speaker 2: 'Summer Action '67', and 'Summer Action '68' (laughter) (unclear).
Speaker 1: That was part of the program where--
Speaker 2: That was part of the, part of the overall Anti-Poverty Program.  I did other things too.  I also taught English to adults.  I worked at the OIC, Opportunities Industrialization Corporation [Center], I think it was called.  And I had, you know, a dozen other different jobs (laughter), while I was in school.
Story_ID: 36971
Speaker 1: And the thing about that little newspaper [school newspaper in Milwaukee; 'Summer Action '67', and 'Summer Action '68'] was the editor of 'The Milwaukee Journal' saw that paper one day and asked where it came from.  Somebody got a hold of me, and he invited me in, Joseph Shoquist--he was the editor of the 'Journal' at that time.  He invited me in and said, would you like to have an internship at 'The Milwaukee Journal', summer internship, 'cause you, you know, you seem to have some kind of talent.  And, of course, I said, yes.  And I got an internship the following summer, which was '69 [1969], I believe, at 'The Milwaukee Journal', while I was at UWM [University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee].  And that internship led to freelance work for 'The Journal'.  And I did some stories.  I remember doing a story related to housing, several stories related to housing, and I did obituaries and, you know, all the stuff that young journalists did in those days.  And I said, this is, I like this.  This is good.  I think I'll do this.
Speaker 2: Okay, can you--what stories did you contribute early on?
Speaker 1: Oh, my gosh.
Speaker 2: That would be a big deal.  Can you remember your first story?
Speaker 1: I don't know remember--I know that this wasn't the first story--
Speaker 2: (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: But I remember one I did.  I don't remember--it was not the first story, also related to housing.  'The Journal' at that time had started--there's a term for it.  I can't think of it, had started doing a lot of stories challenging segregation in Milwaukee.  And I participated in a story in which I was sent undercover, so to speak, to try to rent an apartment.  And then a white reporter was sent to the same apartment, and we all, you know, we all had the same qualifications, blah, blah, blah.  And the story, of course, was when I went to get, to rent the apartment, it was already rented.  It wasn't available anymore.  When the white reporter went the day after, suddenly, the apartment was available.  And we did, that was the story I certainly remember because of the nature, its nature.  And, you know, a few other, I mean nothing terribly deep (laughter), nothing terribly profound, but that was very important to me, to be a part of that.
Story_ID: 36972
Speaker 1: And the other thing that was very important to me was just to be in 'The Journal' [The Milwaukee Journal] newsroom because there were a few other blacks there.  Larry Whiteside was a sports reporter at that time.  There were a few men.  There were a couple of women.  There was a woman at the 'Milwaukee Sentinel', Rae Moore.  She was a writer, a black woman who was a writer.  She and I made friends.
Speaker 2: How do you spell her name?  Is it--
Speaker 1: R-A-E.
Speaker 2: Okay, Moore.
Speaker 1: Moore, M-O-O-R-E.  So there were very few of us, but there were a few.
Speaker 2: Now, she was at the--
Speaker 1: At 'The Sentinel'.
Speaker 2: At 'The Sentinel', okay.  And you were at 'Milwaukee Journal'?
Speaker 1: 'Journal', right.
Speaker 2: What was the name of--was there a black paper in town then?
Speaker 1: 'Milwaukee Courier'.
Speaker 2: The 'Milwaukee Courier', okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I did some freelance work for the 'Milwaukee Courier' too.
Speaker 2: So when you were working for the 'Milwaukee Journal', how many papers were in town in terms of, I mean major papers?
Speaker 1: Just the 'Journal' and the 'Sentinel'.  They were not owned by the same company.  Subsequently, they were bought by the, and became part of the 'Journal' company.  But at that time the 'Sentinel', I believe the 'Sentinel' was independent.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The 'Sentinel'--no, I'm sorry.  They were part of the same company, but the 'Sentinel' was the morning paper.  The 'Journal'--the 'Journal' was the evening paper, I think.
Speaker 2: Okay, it seemed like they evolved that way in those days--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, there were--
Speaker 2: --in a lot of cities.
Speaker 1: -- double--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And Detroit [Michigan] is like that now, owned by the same people, '[Detroit] Free Press', and 'The Detroit News'.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  And 'The Courier', of course, was a small black paper, family owned.  Jerrel Johnson [Jones], I think was the name of the owner.  And I did a little bit of reporting and writing for them.
Story_ID: 36973
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is, so Milwaukee's [Wisconsin] in the same sort of struggles and issues are going on in Milwaukee that are going on in the rest of the nation?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, summer of '68 [1968], and you're still working on the student summer--I mean the summer project, paper.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, did--well, prior to that summer was the assassination of Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now, did--were there riots in Milwaukee?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not like, you know, Detroit [Michigan] or Los Angeles [California], but there was.  There were fires set, and there was a lot of unrest.  And it was, you know, it's a bad summer all around.
Speaker 1: Now, was it right after--was it that summer that you were hired as an intern at 'Milwaukee [Journal']--
Speaker 2: The following--later that year.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: The following summer, of '69 [1969].
Speaker 1: Oh, so, '69 [1969], okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: So, '68 [1968], of course, was an important year for me in it was, obviously, a big year in American social history because of all those things.
Speaker 1: Bobby [Robert F.] Kennedy being killed (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, and Malcolm X and then, of course, the Vietnam [war].  You know, Vietnam was in full swing, and there were lots of protests, anti-Vietnam protests in Wisconsin, not as much in Milwaukee as there was in Madison [Wisconsin].  But you might remember there was a bombing in Madison [Wisconsin] of the science building, and there were bombing threats in Milwaukee against the war.
Speaker 1: And Madison seemed to be one of the epicenters for Vietnam protests in the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --country, you know.  It reported on Madison--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, UC [University of California]-Berkeley--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.  And a lot of my male friends were, had gone to Vietnam.  Some of them were there.  I had some friends who died in Vietnam, and so it was very close to all of us.  And a lot, and then, of course, the Anti-War Movement along with the Civil Rights Movement was a lot of emotion and a lot of tension and a lot of activity going on.  So it was interesting (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Now (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --and it was, for me it was amazing because I felt like I could make a contribution, a positive contribution in some way to what I thought was social causes.
Story_ID: 36974
Speaker 1: Can you remember the, I guess, one of the early times when you consciously knew that being in the position of being a journalist, you could actually feed a story the way you wanted to or you could tell people what you wanted them to know about a certain issue?
Speaker 2: Yes, first, working, being in Milwaukee [Wisconsin] and being aware of the Civil Rights Movement there, but also watching to the TV networks' coverage of the Vietnam War, not so much the Civil Rights Movement because the Civil Rights Movement was covered, of course.  Dan Rather and a lot of reporters were in the South covering the Civil Rights Movement.  But I was, I was very aware of the power of the images of people and what, the way in which the broadcast media especially, but newspapers too, were able to explain to America what was happening.  One of my, my best mentor at the 'Milwaukee Journal' was a reporter named Frank Aukofer.  Frank--his name is A-U-K-O-F-E-R.  Frank was a white reporter, and he covered the Civil Rights Movement in Milwaukee as well as in the South.  And he used to tell me about going--he went to Selma [Alabama] and all these places.  And he would tell me about these things.  And he told me about how he had to work, as a white reporter, to understand what was happening to black Americans.  So, and I'm still friends with him (laughter).  He lives here--as a matter of fact, he was, lived in Washington [District of Columbia] for a long time.  And so I realized, I said you have to, it takes effort to understand what's happening to other people, takes effort to find out what's happening to yourself, but great effort and energy to be a journalist and to be able to observe and put yourself also in the shoes of the people you're observing 'cause you have to do both.  You can't just stand back and say, oh, they did this, they did that.  And especially, when you're reporting on volatile social issues, whether it's a war, you know, a civil war, a cultural movement, and this took a lot of energy, a lot of insight, and a lot of work.  But it's--the result and the satisfaction were so important because you were having, you're making a big contribution to your society, to your culture.  And I thought that was a very important thing to be able to do.  And then watching also the Vietnam War coverage and seeing, you know, the horrible things that were going on, that we were doing and then hearing my friends, my black friends in Milwaukee who had come back from Vietnam, and, you know, the whole thing we were all going through.  Mohammed Ali said he wasn't gonna go (laughter) to fight to kill, you know, brown people who hadn't done anything wrong to him, and all that was part of what was going on in this country.  So there was--we, it was really a moment of awakening for many, many people on all sides of the racial barriers in our country.  And the thing too that helped me a lot was, I got to travel, I made some small trips to Selma and I went to Tuscaloosa [Alabama] and some of these other places in, I think it was '66 [1966], '67 [1967] when the drive to get people to register to vote was going on.  So I also learned how important it was, how important it was to participate in the civic life of this country, and I thought this was important to report too.  So I was both observing and taking part in this thing at the same time.  But in the late '60s [1960s] is when I really thought, to be a good journalist is something to be admired and to work for because not only are you a craftsperson, but you can effect change in your own society.  And that's when I really got hooked on journalism.
Story_ID: 36975
Speaker 1: We're at 1969 now, I guess?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And so, the 'Milwaukee Journal', right.  You were there--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --from 1969 to '70 [1970]--
Speaker 2: To '70 [1970], yeah, I left in the spring of '70 [1970].  I'm sorry, yeah, spring of '70 [1970], went to New York.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you already have something set up in New York?
Speaker 2: I got into the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism, Summer Program for Minorities and Women.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is, so--okay, this is the summer program.
Speaker 2: 1970.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well, tell us about that?
Speaker 2: In 1967, end of '67 [1967]--let's see, the major riots were '67 [1967], '68 [1968].  After the Kerner Commission Report, the Kerner Commission Report, of course, was commissioned by President Johnson [Lyndon Johnson] after the riots.  And Kerner Commission, Otto Kerner was the former governor of Illinois.  He was supposed to figure out why there were race riots in the United States and what to do about it.  And he wrote a report for the president and the report was the White Paper that stated what was wrong with the American--with America (laughter) where race was concerned.  In the Kerner Commission, there was a chapter on the media in America and how it contributed to racism and segregation.  Columbia University School of Journalism in response to that report, joined with the Ford Foundation--actually, I think it's Ford Foundation initiated, the Ford Foundation, Columbia University, 'New York Times', I believe, 'The Wall Street Journal', NBC network, ABC and CBS network, decided to create a program to bring more minorities into journalism because one of the criticisms of the Kerner Commission Report was that there weren't enough minorities in the field of journalism in this country, in any of our institutions, and that this had contributed to the lack of understanding of what was happening to African Americans in the country.  So in '68 [1968] or '69 [1969], Columbia's School of Journalism started an intense four-month program in the summer.  It lasted until 1972, I believe.  I think four, five years long.  I was in the program in the summer of 1970, and I got into the program--the way the program functioned was they went around the country trying to recruit people that they thought would be eligible.  And they had print and broadcast programs.  And they were looking for women as well as minorities of all sorts.  And they went to look at newspapers--went to newspapers and TV stations and radio stations around the country, and if they saw a young minority talent, they would ask them to apply for the program.  Under the program, you were supposed to be, if you were in the program, you were supposed to be sponsored by a media outlet in your city.  I was supposed to be sponsored by the Milwaukee [Wisconsin]--by the ABC station in Milwaukee, which was WITI.  And I actually worked part time at that station for a couple of months (laughter).  And I wasn't treated nicely there (laughter).  But the Columbia program had WITI listed as one of the potential sponsors 'cause this was the thing to do if you were a TV stations.  You'd say, oh, sure, I'll help train a minority journalist.  WITI had signed up to train, that they were supporting minority journalist.  After you got through the program in Columbia, you were supposed to go to work for that station 'cause that station essentially was contributing some money to your training.  When the people at Columbia said we have--there's a station in Milwaukee that will sponsor you, WITI, I said, oh, I don't wanna go to work for them 'cause I didn't--wasn't treated well there.  And they said, well, you work it out with WITI.  So I had to talk to the news director there with WITI, and I said to him, I called him and said, I got invited to attend this special program.  They say that you are going to be my sponsor, but I'm not too keen on that and that I have to come back to work for you after I finish the Columbia program.  I said, I don't think I'm gonna do that.  And the general manager of the station's director said you have to do that 'cause that's the program.  I said, okay, we'll see.  I went in the program that summer, finished it, went back to Milwaukee.  I worked at WITI for about two months.  I think I worked there in September, October, and I quit, and I moved to Boston [Massachusetts].
Story_ID: 36976
Speaker 1: Now, did--how did, I mean what was the nature--well, I can just pretty much imagine if they'd never had any black employees before or anybody different, but what happened at WITI [television station in Milwaukee, Wisconsin]?
Speaker 2: The, there was one black girl there, a black woman (laughter) who was an editor, and I think they had a black guy who was doing sports, and that was it.  And then I was essentially a clerk, and did a little bit of helping around the newsroom.  The news director told me, 'cause I think I must have said something about, you know, I wonder if I could ever be on air.  And the news director told me, oh, no, no, no.  First of all, you don't look black enough to qualify (laughter).  Second of all, I had long hair, and he said, well, if you went on TV, you'd have to cut your hair off and put it in an Afro, and third of all, your name is not black.  I said, Bunyan.  Yeah, Bunyan's not a black name, and he said, yeah, if you were to come to work on air, I think you should change your name to King.  That's black--Martin Luther King, Jr.  And I thought this was all absurd.  So I laughed it off.  And, but when I found out that this same man had said he would sponsor a black journalist to come back and work for them, I said, well, that's hypocritical, isn't it, because here he had someone who looked like she had capability, at least in her own mind.  But he was telling her, me, I didn't qualify because of my appearance and because of my name?  I said, that's very strange.  And so when I learned that he was supposed to be my boss, I said, no, no, no.  I don't respect that guy, and I don't think he respects me.  So basically, I said to myself, and then I worked it out.  I said, you know, I don't think I'm gonna work here.  But I went back and worked there for two months until I could get another job.
Speaker 1: So did you--what did you do for two months?
Speaker 2: Basic, you know, run-of-the-mill reporting, not much, very little.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think I was on, maybe I was on the air for two or three times (laughter), but, you know, nothing much.
