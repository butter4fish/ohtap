Speaker 1: --And went downstairs to--our shower room was downstairs.  When I went downstairs, I had to hold onto the railing I was so weak.  I was sitting on the bench and coach came in and sat down beside me, said, he said, "[HM A. Paul] Moss, I hate to tell you this, but you're gonna fool around and get in trouble."  He said, "Because you didn't get in till 1:30 and you know that's again--totally against my regulations."  And he said, "You know these children's fathers come to me to get things straightened out with athletes," and he said, "this afternoon I punished you by putting you on that basketball court."  And he said, "You wanna watch yourself because you're gonna fool around"--and that's one of the things I went home and told my mother [Ida Byrd Moss] about, and that was one of the things she said, said well you going to a colored college 'cause you're gonna fool around here and get lynched.  And so that's why I went to Bluefield [State College, Bluefield, West Virginia].
Speaker 2: Did you hear about the lynching in Springfield in 1917?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes I knew about it.  My mother [Ida Byrd Moss] talked about it incessantly.  See I was--'course 1917 I was about six years old.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right, yeah.
Speaker 1: I was born in 1911.

Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm the interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Edgar Carey Lane.  Now sir, could you please state your name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: My name is Alonzo Paul Moss.  Alonzo was a minister who--a visiting minister in the Baptist church.  And Paul comes from Paul Laurence Dunbar, who was a poet in Dayton, Ohio.  And that's where I get my middle name.  And Moss of course is my dad [Robert Moss].  My dad was born in Berea, Kentucky and moved to across the Ohio River into Lockland, Ohio.  And that was where he lived with his brother.  His mother died when he was three years old, and he lived with his brother in Lockland, Ohio until he was old enough to join the National--what we call the [U.S.] National Guard.  But back in those days, it was the standing army.  And he went into the [U.S.] Army and became a figure skater.  He--when he got out of the Army he corresponded with my mother [Ida Byrd Moss].  But when he got out of the Army, she discovered that he couldn't read and write.  So she had to teach him to read and write.  And he finally ended up, they ended up with a family of seven boys and one girl.  I was the sixth of the seven boys.  And as our--the boys grew up, they were all large fellas and when they got to be fourteen and fifteen, they would leave home and go out and get a job.  But when I got old enough to finish junior high school, my mother said you're not gonna get a job, you're gonna stay in school and get an education and amount to something.
Speaker 1: Now sir, let me just--I just want to establish like, what your name is and I'm gone ask you where you were born and we'll get to your--the, the rest of the story, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: As we, as we progress.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: So, but what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I was born on May the 16th, 1911 in Springfield, Ohio.
Speaker 1: Okay, and sir what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: Now I--my final occupation was a teacher and educator.
Speaker 1: But you were an official in the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association], right?
Speaker 2: I was an official in the YMCA.  I began as a boy's work secretary.  They called 'em secretaries in those days.  A boy's work secretary and physical director.
Speaker 1: Okay, and YMCA.  Okay, now what is today's date?
Speaker 2: The date?
Speaker 1: Yeah, today's date.
Speaker 2: I finished college in 19 and 35 [1935].
Speaker 1: No sir, what is today's date?  Today.
Speaker 2: Today's date?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: This is June the 10th, 2004.
Speaker 1: Yes sir.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We are at the Heartlands Retirement Village.  I'm in the assisted living section.  I've been the chairman of this section.  We have sixty-six residents.  I'm the chairman of this section since I've been here.  I've been here for six years.
Speaker 1: All right, and this is Ellicott--
Speaker 2: Beg your pardon?
Speaker 1: This is Ellicott City, Maryland.
Speaker 2: Ellicott City.  This is Heartlands in Ellicott City, Maryland.
Story_ID: 192234
Speaker 1: All right.  Well sir, there are--before we go into depth, there are five People magazine-ish type questions we always ask and they just require a short answer.  And the first one is, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite, favorite food is chili.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Favorite color.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Blue.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Spring and Fall.  Midsummer is too humid here.
Speaker 1: That's what everybody says.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Vacation, two areas that I have visited for vacation.  One, Woods Hole, Massachusetts, Cape Cod, and the other one is Jamaica.  I've been to Jamaica twelve times.  And Jamaica and the islands, Caribbean islands, I've spent considerable time.  I've always had to work in the summer time, so I tried for the most part to go to the islands because it's usually warmer there than it is in this part of the country.
Speaker 1: Okay, and sir, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: My favorite statement is that I don't care where you came from, who you are, or how much money you have.  If you haven't done something to help somebody along, and help them live a better life, then your life has not been worthwhile.  That's my favorite statement and I use it quite often.  And I usually end up by quoting the sports saying that when the one great writer comes to write against your name, he writes not that you won or lost, but how you played the game.  That's my favorite saying to everybody.
Story_ID: 192235
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about, now you were talking about your father before we, before I interrupted you to make sure we slated this.  But can you give us your father's full name and, and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: His name was Robert Moss.  That's the only name I ever knew for him.  And he was a very, very strict discipline, disciplinarian.
Speaker 1: Excuse me, but where was he born and when was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Berea, Kentucky.
Speaker 1: Do you know his birthday?
Speaker 2: I don't have a birth date.  I don't know his birth date right off.  But he lived with my--as I indicated some time ago, he moved across--Kentucky was a southern state.  And he moved across the Ohio River to Lockland, Ohio and lived there with his brother until he was old enough to go into the standing army.  And standing army at that time was equivalent to the [U.S.] National Guard now.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you said he became a figure skater.
Speaker 2: He became a figure skater and he corresponded with my mother [Ida Byrd Moss].  And evidently he had somebody else to write his letters and so forth because when they finally met, he could not read or write.  But they were--had only met each other eleven days before they were married.  And they married and built our home at 808 West Grand Avenue in Springfield, Ohio.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you know much about your father's early life and where he went to--did he get--have a chance to go to school or anything?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think he had any early education because my mother taught him to read and write.  And so I knew nothing about his early education.  Only that what my mother had told me about him, his living with his brother in Lockland.  I knew he lived with a brother in Lockland because we had visited Lockland a couple of times in my early childhood.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What, what kind of personality did your father have?
Speaker 2: My father?
Speaker 1: Yes sir.
Speaker 2: He was very strict.  He worked hard.  He worked in a--for Bauer Brothers [ph.], and he was a cupola tender, and you know the cupola was a big unit that--in which they heated iron and he would throw this--they would throw this iron into this cupola that was very hot.  And the molten iron would come out.  And they'd catch it in the ladle and pour molds.  And that was his work.  He worked there for forty-seven years.  And during that--up until the time that he retired after forty-seven years there.  And then when he retired of course he lived with my sister [Ida Byrd Moss].  I never knew my sister very well because she was born the year I was a junior in high school.  And because I was an athlete, I seldom went home after school, so I didn't have a chance to know her.  I played football, basketball, track and tennis, and had very little time at home in the evenings when it was time to have meals with the family.
Story_ID: 192236
Speaker 1: Now you got, you've got seven, six brothers, right?
Speaker 2: Six brothers, right.
Speaker 1: Can you name them all for us from the beginning?
Speaker 2: Yes.  William, William was the oldest.  William was born in 1898, and he put up his age in order to fight in the First World War [World War I, WWI].  The second brother was Walter.  Now Walter sort of worked for the government.  He was in and out of Columbus, Ohio working in a supply operation.  And Walter got--the minute our--my brothers got old enough, they moved away from home and got jobs.  Then the next one Walter, and the next one was Tom, Thomas.  His real name was Talmadge, but we called him Thomas.  And he was--but he was mechanically inclined.  And drove one of the first tractor-trailer trucks.  And he used to talk about how difficult it was to learn to back that tractor-trailer up.  But he worked for an outfit that built bridges and he spent much time in Florida and so forth, building bridges.  And he told us one time that he drove the tractor-trailer that had the switchboard for the World Trade Center [New York, New York] on it.  And he drove it from Westinghouse [Electric Corporation] into New York [New York] when they were building the World Trade Center.  And then the next one was Arthur.  And Arthur was sort of a mechanic.  He worked for a printing company.  He--at--in this printing company, they printed metal signs.  And he worked there for years.  And what he did around home, he built a rock garden out of small rocks and he placed it in cement and made--had sort of a little rock garden and it became very popular.  People would come from miles around to see his rock garden.  That was, that was Arthur.  And then Bernard was next to me.  Bernard didn't stay at home very long.  The minute he got old enough, he moved out and ended up in California.  And he worked for one of the early airplane outfits in California.  And I think one of the things that he was attracted to because living in Springfield [Ohio], that was only about 20 miles from Dayton, Ohio where the Wright brothers [Orville Wright and Wilbur Wright] had of course invented the airplane.  And I can remember the first airplane that ever flew over our house.  It sounded like a motorcycle.  And my mother [Ida Byrd Moss] didn't know what it was and she was--liked to scared her to death.  But that was the first time we knew anything about airplanes.  But of course that was flying into what was then the Patterson Field.  And during the Second World War [World War II, WWII], they made it Wright-Patterson Air Force Base [Ohio].  And my wife [Evelyn Moss] actually worked for the adjutant general at that [U.S.] Air Force base.  And of course I ran the USO [United Service Organizations] for Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.
Speaker 1: Who was the adjutant general, do you remember?
Speaker 2: I don't know his name at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I know when she came home in the evenings, she couldn't hardly talk about anything because most of the stuff that they dealt with was secret during the Second World War.
Speaker 1: Classified, yes.
Speaker 2: So she couldn't talk very much about it.
Speaker 1: Now let, let me go back to your, your bro--did you name all your brothers for us?
Speaker 2: Yeah, then Robert was, I was next after Bernard.  And then Robert was the youngest brother.  Robert was sort of a young--he was very sickly.  And then my--they always favored him because he was sort of sickly.  And then my sister was born after Robert.  And then her name was Ida Byrd Moss.  They took my mother's name, my mother's maiden name was Ida Byrd.
Story_ID: 192237
Speaker 1: Now, tell us about your mother.  Now her name was Ida Byrd.  Can you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: Ida Byrd, her family--she says as much as I've ever known, she said that her grandparents moved to Springfield [Ohio] from some French colony someplace.  And she never--I can't remember if she ever told us what French colony it was, but when she moved to Springfield, she was--I mean she was born and reared in Springfield.  And her parents moved and they--the house that her grandparents built was a brick house which stills stands at the corner of Jackson Street and West Grand Avenue in Springfield.  And the house next to that grandparents' house, was her parents' house on one side of the street, and then when she got married, they moved across the street and built a house in which at least seven boys and the one girl were born.  That was 808 West Grand Avenue.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now how--did your mother talk about how she grew up and where she went to school and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: No.  She, I don't know, I don't--the only thing I can remember about my mother was that she was a secretary for the KP [Knights of Pythias] Women's Lodge.  That was the big thing I remember about her.  But she was very strict just like my dad [Robert Moss].  We--I came from a very strict family and you had to toe the mark or else you were in trouble.  And when you went to school, you had to get good grades, 'cause my dad said he didn't have an opportunity to get an education.  But he wanted his children to get an education.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now so you don't know much about--your mother went to school and everything in Springfield, though right?
Speaker 2: No, I don't know about her schooling at all.
Speaker 1: Okay, but she taught your father how to read.
Speaker 2: Yes, she taught my father.  Never had much occasion to talk about her--how she got her education; I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Did you ever meet any of her relatives, your grandparents or anything?
Speaker 2: Yes, I met her relatives were the Washingtons who lived in Xenia, Ohio.  And the Henrys who lived in Yellow Springs, Ohio.  And we would visit them.  My dad used to rent a horse and buggy and every summer we would take a trip to Xenia and visit the--those relatives.  That's how I knew that we had these relatives in those two areas.
Story_ID: 192238
Speaker 1: Now what was your first memory of growing up?  Do you have a earliest memory?
Speaker 2: My first memories of growing up.  I remember going to Fulton [Elementary] School [Springfield, Ohio].  Now Fulton School was about three squares from where I lived on Grand Avenue.  It was the corner of Dibert [Avenue] and Jackson Street.  And it was an integrated school, and during the early migration of people from the South into the North, it suddenly became predominantly a--in those days we called 'em, colored school.  And we had no colored teachers, but the people who were on the opposite side wanted colored teachers.  So they finally--the school board finally hired colored teachers, but they put all the colored teachers in Fulton School, and which made it--automatically they made it a segregated school.  And my mother [Ida Byrd Moss] sent me to school for the first couple of weeks, but a group came to our house, people of the protesters about putting those teachers in that colored school, came to our house to tell my mother that your old colored children will never amount to anything, sending them down there to that nigger school.  And I can remember because I was a youngster on the--playing on the floor in the dining room and heard them tell my mother that.  So my mother took me out of school and the teachers were hired for a year.  And they continued to go to school, but no--with no students.  And at the end of that when the school opened the next year, they put me from the third--I missed the third grade.  They put me in the fourth grade, so I had no third grade education.  But I finished Fulton and--
Speaker 1: Now let me just go back to that for a second.  I wanna understand what happened.  In Fulton School there were all white teachers at first, right?
Speaker 2: Originally were white teachers.
Speaker 1: And then they--then they brought in black teachers.
Speaker 2: Black teachers.
Speaker 1: And then somebody told--what was it--
Speaker 2: There was a protesting group.
Speaker 1: Was that protesting group black or white?
Speaker 2: It was black.
Speaker 1: A black group protested having--
Speaker 2: The black group.  There were two leaders in that, in that black group.  One of 'em was named James Lay [ph.] who owned the coal and ice business.  See in those early days, you had ice.  You delivered a big chunk of ice and put it in a refrigerator.  In the top of the refrigerator, and put your food in the bottom and the circulation kept your food cool.  And then the other one was name--guy by the name of Charlie Johnson [ph.].  Johnson was an early chemist.  He looked to be white, but he was colored.  And he, he and James Lay were the leaders of this protest movement.  And they are the two people who came to my house and told my mother about sending me to school because I was one of the few--my mother said she didn't care who taught her children.  She just wanted them to have an education.
Speaker 1: So they were protesting the black teachers in the school.
Speaker 2: Black teachers in the school because that made it--
Speaker 1: They thought they, they weren't gonna be as good as--
Speaker 2: Because that made that school a segregated school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we had no segregated schools in Ohio at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay.  So were the black teachers then fired or something the next year or what?
Speaker 2: They were only hired for a year.  And when that year was up, then they, they re- put white teachers in again.  And I can remember the first teacher I had was a German teacher.  Her name was Schaft [ph.], Schaft, Mrs. Schaft was my fourth grade teacher.  And eventually they closed Fulton School and because they renovated the school after those years and we had to go to school in the--during the summer we went to school in the fairground.  Now fairground was only about, about a square from that school.  And so we went, went to school in the fairground in the fourth grade, fourth and fifth.  And of course when you got, finished that, then you went to junior high school.  And Central Junior High School [Springfield, Ohio] was in the downtown area right across from the Collier Publishing Company [later the Crowell-Collier Company, Springfield, Ohio].  And we'll talk about the Collier Publishing Company a little later I guess.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 192239
Speaker 1: So you went to Central Junior High School [Springfield, Ohio].
Speaker 2: Central Junior High.
Speaker 1: Now when you were growing up--how would you describe yourself growing up?  What kind of a little guy were you growing up, and what were you interested in?
Speaker 2: Well I had to be a pretty--because of my strict parents [Robert Moss and Ida Byrd Moss], I had to be pretty straight.  And I didn't get into much trouble.  But I was, I guess a little mischievous.  I can remember when I got to junior high school one time, I did something and this white teacher made me stand up beside the wall and bump my head against the wall.  And of course you know I had a little grease on my hair because it was kind of curly in those days and she made me bump my head against the wall and made a grease spot on the wall.  Then she made me take an eraser with chalk and try to get rid of that grease spot on the wall.  I remember that in junior high school.  But in my junior high school days, I was--I learned, actually that's where I first learned to play basketball.  And after that we put up a peach basket on our coal shed.  And that's where I began to learn to play basketball.  And I played basketball in, in high school.  That's where I began, in junior high.  Then we had--there were five junior high schools in Springfield, and we played all of them.  And we beat all of them but Snyder Park [Junior High School, Springfield, Ohio].  And Snyder Park beat Central twice.  The only two games we lost during the whole year.  And--but the gymnasiums were all small.  They--I can always remember, in junior high school the gym was so small that the outside line was up on the wall.  And if the ball hit above that line, it was out of bay--out of bounds.  And if it hit below that line, you could go ahead and play it.  And in those days most of the gymnasiums were so small that the foul circle overlapped the center circle on the floor.  So that's how small the gymnasiums were.  I can always remember that.  That was in junior high school.  And then when it--of course when I got to high school, they had a regulation size gymnasium.  And so you had to learn to stretch in high school.  I was the only colored on the basketball team for four years.  And we were--we had a pretty good team.  And I have a picture of me in my uniform that's showing how I stretched the ball and how I act--
Speaker 1: It was in the paper, right?
Speaker 2: It was in the, in the--we had a picture in the high school paper about that.
Speaker 1: Okay, and were you a basketball star?
Speaker 2: More or less a star.  I wouldn't call it a star, but I was a good, I will confess I was a pretty good player.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause the headline says "Moss Does--" I mean it's got, got your name and that you beat a school in Toledo.
Speaker 2: Toledo Scott [Jesup Wakeman Scott High School, Toledo, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Toledo Scott, right.
Speaker 2: And they were one of the outstanding teams in Ohio.  And my last basket.  You didn't score many points.  If you scored twenty-five, thirty points in those days, that was a high score because in those days every--I was a center.  And every time you scored a point, you had to go back for a jump ball in the center.  And that of course was very slow and so you didn't have much of a chance to score a lot of points.  But I played in Xenia, Ohio once.  I always remember this.  I played in Xenia, Ohio.  They had a segregated school, East High [School, Xenia, Ohio] was segregated.  And Central [High School, Xenia, Ohio] was the school that we played.  And I scored fifteen of the twenty-five points in that game and they called me everything but a child of God.  And threw things at me and, and at the end of the game, they had to back the bus in under the loading dock and put me on it to keep people from--I don't know whether they wanted to lynch me or not, but there was a howling group.  And that's in Xenia, Ohio.  And I always remember that because they had to put me on the bus and get me out of there.
Speaker 1: Yeah that--it's funny 'cause a lot of people because Central State [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] and Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] are right out--well Wilberforce is right outside of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Wilberforce is a few miles--
Speaker 1: Outside of Xenia.
Speaker 2: Of Xenia, that's right.
Speaker 1: A lot of, a lot of people think that Xenia is a black town, but it's not.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: It's not true.
Speaker 2: They had a colored and a white school.
Story_ID: 192240
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, I just wanted to ask you about the lynching in 1917.
Speaker 2: Well, I knew that there was a lynching in Springfield [Ohio].  And it was the corner of I think Wittenberg [Avenue] and High Street, I think.  I think that's where the--where it was.  But see, I was only about six years old and I remember at that time, that was 1917, I was only about six years old at that time.  And I remember my mother [Ida Byrd Moss] talking about it, so I never knew much about a lynching.  But she said that there was a lynching at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, okay.  So did they say--was there any story about what happened or why?
Speaker 2: No, I never knew anything at all about it.  They didn't talk much about that kind of thing.  Because we were sort of removed and, and that was pop- I mean not popular, but that was acceptable, I guess it was acceptable in the South because it was--that's where it happened for the most part, in the South.  But it was so unusual.  That's why they talked about it in, in Springfield.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So I never knew much about it, but you know in those days youngsters didn't get involved in older folks' conversations.  So you had your own field, so you stayed there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my mother used to say, you stay in your place.  Your, your place--my place was not in adult conversations.
Story_ID: 192241
Speaker 1: --What were your favorite subjects in school, when you were in school?
Speaker 2: My favorite subject was math in school.  The--I was pretty good in math.  The--I learned figures better than I learned the English language and the English composition and so forth.  So, but I was really good in math.  Actually when I went to college [Bluefield State College, Bluefield, West Virginia] then, my major was mathematics and biological science.  And of course all through high school [Springfield High School, Springfield, Ohio] I took algebra and trigonometry and all the math studies and I was pretty good at it.  I wanted to be an electrical engineer.  But in high school they, they said there was no field for colored people in engineering, so they put me in a domestic course where I had to learn to cook and wait table and all about taking care of people.  And I never got into--got a chance to use my math education.  But I had it.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you have a favorite teacher or a mentor in school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had, the coach was one of my favorites.  Art Mansfield [ph.].  Mansfield was a very strict.  He was kind of like my parents [Robert Moss and Ida Byrd Moss].  And, but in high school, I had a kind of a weird experience.  I was the only colored on the basketball team, and there were only two of us on the football team.  And I got to be very friendly with the only girl in high school who had an automobile.  And she would take me--the football field was about a mile from the school, and she would take me to practice, and we stayed--well we were the--that was the major time that we were together when she would take me to school. But when we played basketball, I can remember the one game especially.  We played Hamilton, Ohio, and we beat them.  And we had a--the coach had a regulation, if you beat the team, you didn't have to come back on the bus; you could come back with your parents or anybody who was there.  So I--we got in the--this little girl's car and instead of coming back to Springfield [Ohio], we went into Cincinnati [Ohio].  And I didn't get home until that night at--all high school kids, just riding around.  Got home at 1:30 at night.  That was on a Friday.  And the following Monday the coach put me on the floor at 3:30 in the afternoon.  And I did not get off the floor until 8:30 that night.  And I was so tired when I got off of the basketball court, I had to hold to the railing to go down to our shower room.  And the coach came down and sat down beside me in the shower room.  He said, "[HM A. Paul] Moss, you gotta be careful about what you're doing because you know that these fathers of these children come to me and ask me to take care of athletes, and you didn't get in till 1:30 the other night."  And he said, "You wanna watch what you're doing because you're gonna get in trouble."  And after that, I kind of got pretty strict.  And I graduated from high school, and the teacher I remember most was the English teacher because I had problems with English.  And I was a little mischievous and we had a--there were about four of us who had a little crazy thing.  We went over to the entrance to the room, we stumbled with the some little crazy stumble.  And--but the teachers were never in the rooms, they would come in after the class was assembled.  But this day the teacher was there.  And as we stumbled in, she said you can stumble right back out and go to the principal's office.  And the principal had a thing that they called the jail.  And you had to stay after school was out, school was out usually 'bout 2:30 or three o'clock in the afternoon.  And you went to jail and made up minutes.  So I got--we each got sixty minutes for stumbling in that room.  And afterward the teacher was talking with me one day and she said, "You did pretty good in my class, but I failed you."  That's the only class I ever failed in high school.  She said, "I failed you because you played in my class."  And that was the only time I ever failed a course in high school. 'Course you had to get good grades in order to--in those days you had to get good grades to play on the team.  So I got good grades in everything but English.  So English has been my downfall--you see I never learned to--because I had no third grade education.  There were certain simple words that I couldn't spell and I still have problems with some of my spelling because--'cause some of them little simple words I just never learned to spell.
Story_ID: 192242
Speaker 1: So when you were on the verge of graduating from high school [Springfield High School, Springfield, Ohio], did you know what you wanted to do?  Did you think you were going to college at that point?
Speaker 2: Well, I--when I got ready to go to college, I really didn't know exactly because they had put me in this domestic course.  But when I went to college, then I was able to get more in the field that I wanted to get in.  But because I had had the training, then I went into science courses.  And when I graduated from Bluefield [State College, Bluefield, West Virginia], I got a Bachelor of Science degree.
Speaker 1: Now how did you choose Bluefield State?
Speaker 2: When I graduated from high school, I had seven scholarship offers.  My--five of them were to white colleges, as this was back in the day before there was much integration.  But I guess because I had been outstanding on that team, I had seven scholarships, five of 'em to white colleges, two of 'em to colored colleges.  One of the was to Paul Quinn College [Dallas, Texas] in Texas.  And my mother [Ida Byrd Moss] said if you go to Paul Quinn in Texas, I possibly won't see you anymore.  So the best thing for you to do is just go to Bluefield.  So I went to Bluefield.  That was very interesting because I hadn't been out of Ohio very much.  But the--I had learned to play tennis in back court, backyard courts and all of 'em were fairly small.  And we, instead of hitting the ball hard, we used to learn to cut the ball.  And in 1929, I went my first trip south I went to Tuskegee [Alabama] to play in the national tennis--Colored National Tennis Tournament.  But I drew the fella who finally won that tournament.  Fella by the name of Reggie Ware [ph.].  He was out of Roanoke, Virginia.  And he at that time was hitting the overhead service, and I had not seen much of that.  And so I don't even--the ball went by me so fast I don't even know what happened.  But I lost that.
Story_ID: 192243
Speaker 1: I came back home from that experience in the South and the next day on the next Saturday, next Sunday, I--my mother [Ida Byrd Moss] washed my clothes on Saturday.  And the next day I got on the bus and started out to go to Bluefield [State College, Bluefield, West Virginia].  I did not know where Bluefield, West Virginia was, but I knew it was in West Virginia.  So the first bus I took was into Huntington, West Virginia.  And then I had to transfer buses and go from Huntington to Bluefield on another bus.  And when I got there it was evening, late evening.  And when I finally got off the bus and took a cab to the school.  And I didn't have any idea what Bluefield was.  I know I'd left Ohio and Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] was so close, people wanted to know why I went to West Virginia.  But I didn't wanna go to school close to home.  But anyway, got in this cab and started--the cab went parallel to the railroad and then crossed over the railroad and went down beside the railroad.  And the school was on the right hand side on the side of a hill.  And I guess it's still that way.  But anyway I had to get out of the cab and walk up the hill with my suitcase, and that was evening.  And there were a group of guys standing on the outside and I asked 'em, you know, I had, had never been away from home about anything.  So I had an idea that you go to the administration building, get registered, had heard all of that.  So as I went up the walkway, these fellas were waiting outside and I asked one of them fellas, where is the administration building?  And of course they had a good laugh out of that because Bluefield was very small, and they were waiting to go in the dining room.  I learned later that there was--these were all guys were there a week before school started because they're all football players and they had a week of training before school opened.  So they told me, go over the hill by this big building on the left, and go to the next building that was on the side--up on the side of the hill, the second hill, and that was the boys' dormitory.  And they said put your things in one of those rooms over there and come back to dinner.  So that's what I did.  And after that of course the next day the coach--after dinner, the coach said everybody who don't have uniforms, get uniforms, and that was in the boys' basement.  I went and they threw out some old, an old jersey and old pair of pants, looked like they been washed four or five times.  And I said what's that for?  And the manager said that's for you to put on.  I said I ain't putting that on, I'm going back home.  So I went back in my room.  The coach came and said to me Moss, he said I know you finished one of those big time white high schools that have better equipment to practice in than we have to play in.  But he said, this is a colored college, and this is the first time it ever hit me.  This is a colored college and we don't have all that stuff.  But he said if you stay here the rest of this week and then--and if you don't like it, then I will pay your way back home.  Well that was a big incentive 'cause I had no way of getting back home, I'd spent all of my money to get there.  But anyway, I did--I finished that week. And of course then I began to meet some girls and so forth.  And things brightened up and so I stayed, I stayed at Bluefield for the four years.  I finished Bluefield in 1935 and I married--you know in college you had big sisters and little sisters.  I married one of the sisters, and her name was Evelyn Louise Harmon.  She lived in Princeton, West Virginia.  And Princeton was twelve, 'bout twelve miles from Bluefield.  But when they finished high school, they would go over to the college because that was the last year in high school.  Some of 'em would finish high school on the college campus.  But for the four years we went.  And at the end of the four years, we were married.  And I have pictures of the two of us in caps and gowns when we graduated in 1935.
Story_ID: 192244
Speaker 1: You graduated from high school [Springfield High School, Springfield, Ohio] in what year, what was it?  What year did you--
Speaker 2: In 1930.
Speaker 1: Thirty [1930], okay.
Speaker 2: In 1930 I graduated from high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, and graduated from college [Bluefield State College, Bluefield, West Virginia] in '35 [1935], okay.
Speaker 2: And in '35 [1935], I finished college, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay now what was your wife's name?
Speaker 2: Evelyn Louise Harmon.  And of course then we finally after we--in 1936 we were married.  And moved to Springfield [Ohio].  And in, back in Springfield, then before coming back to Springfield, after I finished college in '35 [1935], in September of that year school opened and I taught school from September until Christmas.  But I taught in a one-room school right across the Norfolk and Western Railway, on the way to Norfolk [Virginia] out of Bluefield [West Virginia].  And when I would go to the school where I was teaching, I was teaching the third, fourth and fifth grade, but to get to that school, I had to go down through a cornfield, climb over the fence, go across the railroad track and make the fire in a big potbellied stove.  Get that room warm before the children came to school.  And I was teaching the third, fourth and fifth grade in that one-room school.  I didn't know anything to teach those children because my field was mathematics and biological science.  So I was working harder than the children were trying to find something to teach them.  So I resigned at Christmastime and went back home, back to Springfield.  And when I got back home, the first job I had was working in a foundry.  The foundry was where my dad [Robert Moss] had worked for years.  And they--we had to shake out the molds and cut the sand and put it in a wheelbarrow and take it back to the molder's bench so that they can make molds.  And I did that from Christmas until the following July.
Story_ID: 192245
Speaker 1: And in July, the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association], my mother [Ida Byrd Moss] had been active in the YMCA and the Mothers' Club.  In July they were building a new Quonset hut type building for the YMCA gymnasium.  And I helped to build that building.  And when they got that building built, then they hired me as a boys' work executive, they called them secretaries in that--and that was my first year in the YM--working for the YMCA.  That was--
Speaker 2: Now that's--is that in 19--
Speaker 1: Nineteen thirty-six [1936].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I got married that following fall.  I married Evelyn [Harmon Moss] that following fall.  I was making sixty dollars a month and you were lucky if you got it because YMCA was very poor.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you were the boys' programming--
Speaker 1: Boys' work.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They called 'em boys' work secretary.  And physical director.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I remember the first activity we had in that new gymnasium.  We had a high wire club out of Dayton [Ohio] that came over and played basketball.  That was the first big activity.  I had gym classes before that.
Speaker 2: Okay.  How did you like--how'd you like it?  I mean--
Speaker 1: How did I like it?
Speaker 2: Yes, working with youth and--
Speaker 1: Well I liked it very much.  That was--in those days, if you had any kind of a job, you were lucky.  And most of the work around the YMCA was volunteer.  So I started--the first work I did, I volunteered to help build that building.  And course I was acquainted with everything then, and that's why they hired me because I'd helped to build the building because my--most of the work that was done, was done by volunteers.  And I was--got into that volunteer force, and that's how I got introduced to the YMCA, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, now you were part of--you worked at that Y for thirty years, right?
Speaker 1: I worked, I worked at the Springfield YMCA for thirty years.  And during those thirty years, they had always talked about building to--building a new building for the YMCA.  And I have pictures of the old house.  I don't have a picture of that Quonset hut type building, but I have a picture of the old house that housed the YMCA.  And during those early years, we--everybody was interested in the talk about building a new building.  And so we were able to get together a group of men to help raise money to build this new building.  And of course I have pictures of the folder that I developed that had the architect's concept of the--what the building would look like.  And the floor plan had a gymnasium, a regulation swimming pool, a cafeteria and club rooms.  We had two large club rooms.  And of course the executive offices.  And we completed that building in 1950 and I operated that building complete from 1950 to 1960.  I operated the building without a deficit.  When we dedicated that building, $350,000, it was paid for and everything in it.  But getting, raising the money to build that building was a, really a chore.  During the Second World War [World War II, WWII], I had been--I had run the USO [United Service Organization] on weekdays and then on Sundays I had a canteen, youth canteen.  We'd have as many as 150 children in that canteen on Sunday evening.
Speaker 2: Now what is a canteen?  What do you call it?
Speaker 1: A canteen was just a gathering that we had of children.  And canteens were popular in the, in service.  And we just named it the Youth Canteen at the Center Street YMCA [Springfield, Ohio].  Center Street YMCA was--it was founded earlier and was in the downtown area on Center Street, and moved to 521 South Center when they began to build this new building and this new house and so forth.
Story_ID: 192246
Speaker 1: And you said--I know earlier you said your wife [Evelyn Harmon Moss] worked for the adjutant general of the [U.S.] Air Force?
Speaker 2: During the Second World War [World War II, WWII], my wife worked for the Adjutant General Section of the Air Force.  It was about eighteen miles from where we lived in Springfield [Ohio].  And course we had--
Speaker 1: Wright-Patterson [Air Force Base], right.
Speaker 2: Beg your pardon?
Speaker 1: At Wright Patterson.
Speaker 2: Yeah, at that time it was Wright-Patterson.  It started out as Patterson, and then they combined the Wright Field and Patterson Field, and made it Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.  And that was the headquarters for Air Service Command.  And she worked for the Adjutant General in that setup.  And sometimes when she came home in the evening, she could hardly talk about anything because everything in the adjutant general's office was a secret, and she just couldn't talk about it.  I can remember one time when I wanted the car, we had a car then.  I bought an old Packard, a used Packard.  And I went to work with her, and I had to go back and pick her up.  And this was the early spring, and started back home.  And the snow had melted and we were on Route 40 starting into Springfield, coming from Dayton [Ohio].  And I saw something just look like a gray cloud rolling down the road in front of us.  And it turned out that this was water because the ice and snow had melted, and the thawed river from Mad River had overflowed and gone running down Route 40.  Scared, all of us were scared--had four other women in the car with my wife.  And that rolling mass just picked the car up and set it in the ditch right beside the road.  All of us were scared and of course the women--fortunately, a guy came by with a truck that had been hauling logs.  And he stopped and hooked his log chain on the front of the car and pulled it out of the ditch.  And that's how we survived that.  That was the first time I'd ever had a bad scare with water like that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's scary, that is.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And the Mad River, right?
Speaker 2: Because we knew that if--my brothers had always taught me that if the water got over the motor, then you're--it would kill the motor and you couldn't be able to drive the car, so after having that situation, we--the motor--didn't get over the motor.  And so we were able to drive on into Springfield.  And my wife used to pick up the other girls and drive back and forth to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and course I was already at the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association].  And so I stayed there most of the time.
Story_ID: 192247
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, tell us about building this new building and some of the--you were telling us a story about raising money and being discouraged there for a minute, right?
Speaker 1: To raise money to build that new building, we had a campaign.  And I want--there were two or three conditions.  If we built this new building, that we had to serve the girls from the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association].  But to raise the money, we had to have--we had regular teams.  I have pictures of the group of men who got together to raise the money.  And of course in that picture I was in the back.  And they got together and I wanted the Crowell-Collier [Publishing Company, Springfield, Ohio] foundation to--if I--the people at Crowell-Collier didn't know much about the foundation at that time, but--
Speaker 2: How do you spell that?  Can you spell it for us?
Speaker 1: Collier?
Speaker 2: Crowell-Col--when you said--
Speaker 1: Crowell-Collier.  C-R-O-W-E-L-L, Crowell.
Speaker 2: Crowell, okay.
Speaker 1: Crowell-Collier.  They printed, at that time they printed seventeen magazines.  It was one of the largest publishing houses in the world.
Speaker 2: Probably Collier's magazine was probably one of them.
Speaker 1: Collier's magazine.  And I think [The] Saturday Evening Post or some--another big magazine, but the Collier's magazine was popular in those days.  And--but the fellow who had charge of that was a fella by the name of Pete Dennerline [ph.].  And I had to go to see Pete Dennerline.  He had been chairman of my committee when I had the USO [United Service Organization].  But he wanted me to have the colored soldiers come in the USO on Tuesday and Thursday and the white soldiers come in on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.  And I wouldn't do it, I told him that I didn't work for him, I worked for the federal government and the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association].  So we had an integrated USO.  And so when it came time to raise the money to build this building, I had to go to him to ask him to underwrite 10 percent of the cost of this building.  We had all the plans and everything.  And he said I don't know whether you remember or not, but you got smart with me when you were running the USO.  He said I won't give you a dime.  And he said, I can get niggers like you for a dime a dozen.  He said I had a lot of you working in plant now, but they all work in the shipping department.  And sure enough, they did, because I knew some of 'em who worked there.  But they had the big Mack trucks that would take those magazines to the train and so forth.  And that's what most of the colored people did in that plant.  But I was so discouraged after he told me that, I went back home that night to talk with my wife [Evelyn Harmon Moss].  And I was talk--ready to resign from the YMCA.  She said you're not going to resign from the YMCA because you mean too much to these children and this community.  She said you just settle down and go back to work.  And she knew a person in the community who had hired a number of colored people and he was good to 'em.  A fella by the name of Miller.  But he had this firm that was away from--outside of Springfield [Ohio].  And, but he said he would help me.  And he headed my campaign.  And he is a person who said that whatever you need in that building, we gonna try to get it.  And when we got the building completed, dedicated on June 15, 1950, everything in that building was paid for, the building was paid for.  And I operated that building for ten years without a deficit.  And the national personnel office said, if you can do that kind of thing, then we need you in the national office, as a consultant.  So the YMCA national office moved me to Baltimore [Maryland], when the opening became available in Baltimore, they moved me to Baltimore.
Speaker 2: That's 1960?
Speaker 1: Nineteen and fifty [1950].
Speaker 2: No, '60 [1960].
Speaker 1: No, '60 [1960], 1960, 'cause I operated that building--after dedicating it, I operated it ten years without a deficit--
Story_ID: 192248
Speaker 1: Now the colored YMCAs [Young Men's Christian Association], there were thirty-seven of them that were built during that segregation days mostly.  And they were required by the--required to have a certain number of rooms where men could sleep, because they couldn't stay at hotels, they were segregated.  You couldn't stay at hotels.  So the Rosenwald Foundation would match the money that was given by the colored community to help build facilities.  And that's how these thirty-seven colored YMCAs got built.  But by the time we got ready to build the Center Street YMCA, integration had come about, and the Rosenwald Foundation had stopped giving money to YMCAs.  And they gave money to build libraries in colored colleges.  And I--Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] had one of the Rosenwald libraries on the campus there.  That's how the library got started there.  But anyway--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's the only--sir did you know it's the only building, basically that's still operational of the old campus buildings.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: It's still the only one that's--
Speaker 1: And then when Central State [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] came in, they--Wilberforce was on one side, Central State was on--when the state took over Wilberforce and began pouring state money in, then they changed the name to Central State.  And but the library still belonged to Wilberforce, and Wilberforce was on one side.  I understand since then, that now Wilberforce is clear across the road with a separate operation, a separate college altogether.
Speaker 2: Yes sir, yes sir.
Speaker 1: Central State is on one side, and Wilberforce University is on the other side.  I have some pictures of that, that were taken year before last when we visited there, yeah.
Story_ID: 192249
Speaker 1: --I just wanted to ask you about some of the key personalities and some of the sports personalities in Springfield [Ohio] that you may have run across.  And Randy Ayers's, who's the current coach of the Philadelphia 76ers, father was a young man that you coached and taught, right?
Speaker 2: We called, we called--his father we called Crud Ayers.  He was one of the tallest fellas around the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association], he was a good basketball player, and we used to play a lot of volleyball, and he was a good spiker 'cause he was--you set the ball up for him and he'd smash it--but he was good.  And when we got ready to build this new building, this was in the old Quonset type building, and we had to--Crud Ayers had a girl by the name of I think her name was Ethel Smith [ph.].  I remember her last name was Smith.  And I think her name was Ethel.  But anyway, I had the two of them, they took pictures of the two of them and they were on the front of the flyer that I developed to--when I was trying to raise money for--and I have a--the folder has their picture on the front, and on the front of it, it talks about the YMCA progress in Springfield [Ohio].  And I used that flyer when I went to--talked about the fella who--Pete Dennerline [ph.] who was head of the Crowell-Collier Corporation--
Story_ID: 192250
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask you about Davey Moore too, who was a--
Speaker 2: Dave, David Moore was the flyweight champion boxer.  His family lived next door to me, so I knew him very well.  And Davey Moore, in the Olympics he was very popular and I think he won the gold medal in the Olympics [1952 Summer Olympics, Helsinki, Finland] [sic, Moore competed but did not medal].  And later on he was fighting a professional fight and he died as a result of blows that he received about his head.  There--one of the parks in Springfield [Ohio] is still named the Davey Moore Recreation Park.
Speaker 1: That's right.  And did you know the Lytle family of Johnny Lytle who's a famous jazz musician.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I knew Johnny Lytle, I knew the whole Lytle family.  They used to live up on Euclid Street in Springfield.  That was a large family and a Lytle was always--the whole family was musically inclined.  I think they had a singing group even.  And--but they--I knew the Lytles because the youngsters all came--everybody came to the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association].  So I knew most of the kids in, in Springfield during those years.
Speaker 1: Now are there any other Springfield residents of note that, that you wanna mention that, that may have--you may have known during those days?
Speaker 2: Davey Moore and I was trying to think, the Burton, Ron Burton.  Ronald, Ron Burton was All-American at Northwestern University [Evanston, Illinois].  And his brother, Robert Burton later became the mayor of Springfield, and I think they're still, I think they still live in Springfield.  But I haven't kept up.  But I do know that Ron finished, and he went to Massachusetts, and he ran a camp in Massachusetts and he used to take--had busloads of people who--that went from Springfield to visit his camp in, in Massachusetts.  I can't think of it, but he had--he finally died a few years ago.  He had rectal cancer and died a few years ago.  I did not have an opportunity to talk with him much.  I talked with his wife when I found out that that's where he was and what he was doing.  And that's been since I've been in Baltimore [Maryland], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there anybody else from those Springfield days that you--
Speaker 2: I'm trying to think.  The only people that--in my peer group was Burton Curry [ph.], and his father was the pastor of Second Baptist Church [Springfield, Ohio].  When Curry left, then we--when his father left, then we got a fellow by the name of [C. Leroy] Hacker.  Hacker was a showman, sort of a showman.  And he had a son [Benjamin T. Hacker] that he had had problems with and asked me if I would talk with him.  And I talked him into going back to school, so he went to Wittenberg [University, Springfield, Ohio], graduated from Wittenberg and went into the [U.S.] Navy and ended up as an admiral in the Navy.  And he was very successful when we--one time when we went to the islands, he was in charge of the islands.  And I have--I can tell you things about that island.  But anyway, he ended up as an admiral in the Navy.
Speaker 1: So this is an Admiral Hatcher.  Admiral Hatcher.
Speaker 2: Hat--yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Hacker.
Speaker 1: Hacker.
Speaker 2: Hacker.
Speaker 1: Hacker, okay, Hacker.
Speaker 2: His mother [Alzeda Crockett Hacker] was a musician, and she brought the first idea of an angel choir to Second Baptist Church.  I have pictures of that church.  And I had been a member of Second Baptist Church all my life, all my--during my early life because my grandparents helped to build Second Baptist Church.
Story_ID: 192251
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)
Speaker 2: There's a famous Episcopal priest now who grew up in Springfield [Ohio], [HM] Father Richard [L.] Tolliver.  Did you know Richard Tolliver when he grew up in Springfield?
Speaker 1: I knew Powell, but--
Speaker 2: No, I'm talking about Richard Tolliver.
Speaker 1: Houser?
Speaker 2: Tolliver.
Speaker 1: Toll, oh, Tolliver, yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's the--Father Tolliver is a pastor in Chicago [Illinois].  He's a priest at St. Edmund's Episcopal [Church, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Well Tolliver, his father was the one who stopped me from deciding that being elected--I had been rather popular.  And they wanted me to run for the school board in Springfield.  And I decided I would run for the school board, but before the election, people who had grudges against the school situation, for instance, there was a fella--see we had five junior high schools.  I've talked about that.  Roosevelt Junior High [later Roosevelt Middle School, Springfield, Ohio] didn't have very many colored.  And, but there was a hangout at a filling station near that and the head of that filling station wanted it closed.  I mean the people wanted that filling station closed.  So they came to me and asked me, said if you get on the school board, I want you to vote against that location.  That was the big thing that happened.  Then other people would come, came to me and asked me, said if you're elected to the school board, you--we want you to do things for that.  And then Tolliver's father told me, he said Moss, he said I don't know whether you wanna get into politics or not because politics, you can't vote your own convictions.  He said you give up your principles to help somebody else get something passed.  They give up something to get you, help you get things passed.  And said very often there are things that you don't agree with.  He said so I don't think you'd make a very good politician.  He said you can't be a good politician and be a good Christian.  So I resigned from that and I have never been elected to anything, even as late as coming here in the church after I remarried my second wife [Elizabeth Murphy Phillips], she was Episcopal.  And they wanted me to run for the electorate in the Episcopal church.  And I refused because that was an election.  And when I came here, they appointed me as chairman of the assisted living group and we had monthly meetings here every month.  And I had to preside over those meetings.  And then after I'd been here a couple of years and a lady who wanted to be in that position said that she wanted to have an election.  So I got everything ready, and they said you will have to be elected.  I said if I have to be elected, you can forget about it because I will not be elected.  I said if you appoint me, I will work as hard as anybody who is elected to get anything done.  So then they reappointed me up until about two weeks ago, I was still chairman of the assisted living section.  And as chairman, I served on the executive council here at Heartlands [Retirement Community, Ellicott City, Maryland].
Story_ID: 192252
Speaker 1: --Now you're in Baltimore [Maryland], you bought a house.
Speaker 2: Moved to Baltimore.
Speaker 1: You said you bought a house and you're waiting for your wife [Evelyn Harmon Moss] to move in and what happened?
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.  Well, after I'd been here two years and three months, my first wife, who was returning to Baltimore from Springfield [Ohio], had had an accident on the Pennsylvania Turnpike and killed both my wife and her best friend.  I had gone to Springfield to speak at the opening of the membership campaign on that Friday.  But I came back to Baltimore early on the bus because I was the speaker at Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland] on Saturday.  And so I came back and spoke at Morgan on Saturday.  On Sunday we were waiting for my wife and her sister to come from Springfield, my wife and another girl, not my--her sister, another girl, George Wright who was my roommate in college.  And he had married a girl in Bluefield [West Virginia].  And they had followed me back to Springfield, and when it came time to come to Baltimore, they had moved to Baltimore.  And she was with my wife, returning to Baltimore from Springfield, was both, killed both of them.  That was on April the 5th, well the 6th, 1963.  And we had always had an agreement that if anything happened to one of us, that the other would go on and live our lives.  So I remarried and I married the girl who was by the name of Elizabeth Murphy Phillips, who was a member of the Murphy family who owned the [Baltimore] Afro-American newspapers.  And when I married her in December of '63 [1963], and of course she knew everybody.  So that--every time I talked about going to New York, the idea of my coming to Baltimore to get three years' experience on a corporate staff, that all went out the window because she always said that there's no Afro in New York.  So I'm in Baltimore.
Story_ID: 192253
Speaker 1: But Baltimore [Maryland] has been very good to me in--after I decided to stay here.  In 1970, I believe, 1970, the governor [Marvin Mandel] appointed me to the Board of Regents at the University of Maryland.  The Board of Regents govern five universities.  The University of Baltimore [Baltimore, Maryland], Univer--College Park--
Speaker 2: University of Maryland at College Park [College Park, Maryland].
Speaker 1: University of Maryland at College Park, University of Maryland Eastern Shore [Princess Anne, Maryland], and [University of Maryland] University College [Adelphi, Maryland] had 36,000 students overseas in Germany, half of 'em in Germany and the other was in Japan.  And I visited--I was the representative from the Board of Regents to the graduation in that Patch Air Force Base [sic, Patrick Henry Village] in Heidelberg, Germany.  I was one of the speakers.  I remember the outstanding people who were there then.  Helmut Kohl was one of the people that were in that--at the reception luncheon for that graduation class.  And then of course in eighteen years, and I served on the Board of Regents, I was secretary for two years, treasurer for two years and secretary for three years.  And that plaque on the wall there is the citation from the president of the University of Maryland after serving that time.  Governor [William Donald] Schaefer put all the colleges and universities under the university system, that he called it.  It was patterned after the university system of North Carolina.  And all of the colleges except Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland] and Western Maryland College, I think it's called McDaniel College [Westminster, Maryland] now, all of those, all the colleges, state colleges, are under that system except those two.  The University of Maryland Board of Regents fought against it, but Schaefer had more power than that board, so that board was absolved and now the University System--the idea, his idea was that each of the state colleges had to go to the legislature to get money to--for their--to support their work.  But if you put 'em all under this one head, then the one head would go to the state board to get support for all the five universities and that--all the state universities in that system.  And that's what is still in existence.  The idea before that, the colleges were fighting one another when they went to state legislature.  One of the things I remember most about serving on that, was when [R] Adams Cowley developed the shock trauma system.  He came and called me up one day and said, you're on the Board of Regents, and I hope you will go to the state board and request $36,000 to begin the shock trauma unit.  I went and I talked with Clarence [W.] Blount, who at that time was the--had the--he was--when I first met Clarence Blount, he was assistant principal of Dunbar High School [Baltimore, Maryland].  And we began--we got to be close friends.  And I went to Blount and Blount and I made the presentation to the state legislature to get funding to start the shock trauma unit.  We got the funding and the first helicopter that ever landed, the two of us were two of the people who met that helicopter.  And now that whole system has become so popular that people almost all over the world have shock trauma units.  I think [Johns] Hopkins [University, Baltimore, Maryland] was the next one after University of Maryland [at College Park, College Park, Maryland] to have a shock trauma unit.  And now when the shock trauma unit at University of Maryland was full, they used to have what they called the fly by.  And they would go to Hopkins and these other hospitals that had shock trauma units.

Speaker 1: So I've been in the middle of a lot of developments.  While I was with the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association], I integrated, of course integrated the YMCA, but I was to do three things with the YMCA.  Going back to that, I was to integrate the corporate staff of the YMCA.  I knew much more about camping than most of the people on the YMCA staff, so they made me the camp director of the--we had two, had three camps at that time.  The colored camp was Camp Druid Hill [Calvert County, Maryland].  The white camp was on the Chesapeake Bay, and that was Camp Canoy [Calvert County, Maryland].  Then we had a Black Rock Camp [Butler, Maryland].  Well, as time evolved, the Baltimore Gas and Electric [Company] built a nuclear power plant [Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Lusby, Maryland] on the bay, and that was about a mile from Camp Canoy.  They told me if they ever had a nuclear accident, they'd have to get the children out within three hours.  And finally the YMCA decided to close Camp Canoy and when they closed Camp Canoy, then they decided to develop Camp Druid Hill.  And at that--the first name was Camp Mohawk.  And then when they decide--when I first went to that camp, it was changing from Druid Hill to Mohawk.  And then when they put all the camps together, they made it Camp Kings Landing [Huntingtown, Maryland].  The name Kings Landing came from the fact that at that location they used to roll large hogsheads of tobacco down the road where this camp was.  This camp was on the Patuxent River.  And they would load those, this tobacco on on the float in the river and take it down to the Chesapeake Bay, and then on to England.  The tobacco that was raised in Maryland was a slow burning tobacco, and it was very popular.  And that's why it was popular and that Kings Landing was the name that it took.  Now Kings Landing camp, eventually I had only colored boys at the first, and then we integrated and we had colored and white boys.  And then when they made it Kings Landing, we began to take girls into the camp.  And I had a camp that where we had--we'd have 250 children every two weeks in six villages in that camp.  And that camp was developed to a point we built a swimming pool.  They used to swim in the river, in the Patuxent River.  And only time I ever lost a child, I lost it in that river.  And we finally found out that this boy had epileptic spells.  And we think after it was all over, we think that he had one of these spells.  We had a buddy system.  And they blow--the waterfront director would blow the whistle, and they had to stop and hold up the hand of his buddy.  And this boy had disappeared in that river.  And we didn't find him until the next day.  We had people from--soldiers and everybody searching the woods and so forth because this boy had disappeared.  And we found him three days later way down the river where he had drowned in that river.  It's the only child I ever lost in all my forty-seven years with the YMCA and in recreation.  But my hair almost turned white overnight when I lost that child.  But anyway, that camp now is Kings Landing State Park.  The YMCA sold it, sold it to the state.  And it's a state park now with the swimming pool and everything still intact there.  And I have not been there for the last few years, when I was on the [University of Maryland] Board of Regents, we would take trips to the eastern shore and so forth, and I was able to visit that location.  But King's Landing, I developed a Mothers' Club to help raise money to build tennis courts and so forth at that camp.  And that--Kings Landing Mothers' Club is still in existence.  These women are still together, some of 'em, and they raised money to build, to help develop that camp.  But they're still together.  And we developed, as a result, after [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] was killed, because I had known Coretta Scott [King] before that, before that.  I thought we could get her for the first speaker at the Martin Luther King Memorial Breakfast.
Story_ID: 192255
Speaker 1: Now you knew Coretta Scott [King] from Antioch College [Yellow Springs, Ohio].
Speaker 2: Yes, I had known--
Speaker 1: Yellow Springs [Ohio], right?
Speaker 2: Coretta Scott before she married [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.].  She was a student at Antioch, and we had a mixed quartet.  Professor [Charles] Wallace was tenor, I was bass, Gertrude Carter was alto and Coretta was the soprano.  And we sang all over Ohio, that mixed quartet sang all over Ohio.  So after Martin Luther King's assassination, the Mothers' Club developed the Martin Luther King Memorial Breakfast.  And we would have as many as 1,700 people for that early morning breakfast.  It's still growing, it's about twenty-eight years old.  And I thought I could get her as the first speaker.  And I corresponded with her until about three months before time for the breakfast, and she finally said that she couldn't do it.  And suggested that I get [HM] Andrew Young, who I think at that time he was very popular.  I don't know whether he was at United Nations or became mayor of Atlanta [Georgia].  But anyway, I tried to get Martin--Andy Young.  And finally Andy said he couldn't be the speaker, and he recommended [HM Reverend] Benjamin Hooks.  And Ben Hooks as you may know, was very popular in the whole movement.  And he was the first speaker for the Martin Luther King Memorial Breakfast--
Story_ID: 192256
Speaker 1: I left the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] in 1976, I believe it was.  And when I left the YMCA, I went to--one of the last things that I did in the YMCA, I tried to get the president of Community College of Baltimore [Baltimore, Maryland] as a speaker for the Martin Luther King Breakfast.  And he refused to do it.  And I told him I was retiring from the YMCA, and he suggested if you retire, why don't you come to community college and be on our staff.  And I had had--I was getting older then.  And he suggested that I take some courses, and I went to Notre Dame [of Maryland University, Baltimore, Maryland] to find out about gerontology, the science of getting old, or people getting older.  And that was one of the things that we did, we wrote a pamphlet on retirement education.  The second thing I did with community college, I taught at Jessup Prison [Jessup Correctional Institution, Jessup, Maryland], a maximum security prison, at Jessup, Maryland.  And I go behind eleven locked doors to teach prisoners.  And I did that for eleven years, teaching that and running seminars in retirement homes and hospitals for older people.  In the seminars we'd have people talk about retirement education and Social Security benefits and all of that, that was all a part of the seminars that we ran.
Story_ID: 192257
Speaker 1: And of course when I--then when I retired from the college [Community College of Baltimore, Baltimore, Maryland], I had begun to have some sick spells.  My wife [Elizabeth Murphy Moss] and I both were sick and one time we were in the University Hos--in Mercy Hospital [Mercy Medical Center, Baltimore, Maryland].  We were in the same room.  And finally she had some kind of ailment where she couldn't keep anything on her stomach.  And that got to be very difficult.  And one day she just said that--she called me Paul.  She's the one who changed me from being Al to Paul.  And she said, Paul, I'm tired.  And she went in the room and she passed away.  Well shortly after that, we lived in Baltimore [Maryland] at 4401 West Forest Park [Avenue].  A fourteen-room house that we had converted to a single-family when I remarried.  My second wife, of course she had three children, they were six, nine and twelve.  And of course they grew up in that house and they had all grown up and thirty-nine years in that house, they all had married and gotten de--all my children have master's degrees.  And they had all moved out and they, they were all over the country.  My son [Michael Alonzo Moss] is associate athletic director, University of Wisconsin [Madison, Wisconsin].  Before going to Wisconsin, he paid all the people in the Olympics [1996 Summer Olympics, Atlanta, Georgia] when it was in Atlanta [Georgia].  And when they finished there, he went to University of Wisconsin.  He is still there.
Speaker 2: So he was in charge of payroll for the Olympics?
Speaker 1: He was in charge of paying all the people in the Olympics.  And at one time he showed me a check for $67 million.  It wasn't a check, it was a draft, $67 million from the Bank of America to pay the people in those Olympics.  And when the Olympics were over, University of Wisconsin, he told me one time if he had been writing a job description, the job that they gave him at the University of Wisconsin is exactly what he would have.  Now what he--he is assistant athletic director, associate athletic director, but he's in close proximity with the president.  When they hire, when they give scholarships to the colored students, very often they are either football or basketball scholarships, and they're not enough students there.  He says there are not enough students there that for them to have their own social groups, and they go in town and get into trouble.  And that's the biggest problem he has, trying to keep the athletes out of trouble.  And then my next daughter, next oldest child is Marie.  And Marie and her husband are pastors of the Metropolitan A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] Church in Washington [D.C.].  One of the larger churches in Washington.  They have over 5,000 members.  They have so many lawyers, they have a lawyers' club in the church.  And, but Marie handled, for a long time handled most of my business here.  But after she moved to Washington, then of course I have taken over and I handle my own business here.  And Faye, Faye has been--I've had some sick spells and had to have my toe removed and in doing that, she was with me through all my tests and all the operations and so forth.  But she and her husband have a camping trailer.  And they took a trip all the way to California.  And she called me on a--they'd make stops.  She ended up in Los Angeles [California], and in Los Angeles to Sacramento [California], then to Seattle [Washington], calling me on the--every stop, the number of stops they make.  And a week or so ago she called me from Wisconsin.  They were visiting with my son [Michael Alonzo Moss].  And they're on the way back to Baltimore.
Speaker 2: So you retired from the city, I mean the colleges--what was the title of your position there?
Speaker 1: I was just a professor at Community College of Baltimore [Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And after I retired from that, I came--my wife [Elizabeth Murphy Moss] died shortly after that, and as I say both of us were sick.  And I came here.
Speaker 2: When did your retire?
Speaker 1: So this is the Heartlands at Ellicott City Retirement Village [Ellicott City, Maryland].
Speaker 2: Yes sir.  When did you retire?  What year was it?
Speaker 1: I retired in '98 [1998], yeah '98 [1998].  Because I came, I retired about, yeah about '97 [1997] is when I retired.  Because '98 [1998] is when I came here after we sold the property on Forest Park [Avenue].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So I've been here since 1998.
Story_ID: 192258
Speaker 1: Sir, we always ask this question, and that is, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: My hopes for the black community is that eventually the whole idea of separate setups and the business of being--because you're black, you are--you have less of our justice.  They have less for the--we get more--less from the justice system.  Because I watch some of the programs where some of our people have been very popular.  I think one of 'em was the one apprentice program ['The Apprentice'] where it ended up with two colored and a white person.  The--and always you can tell--just about tell who's gonna win it if it's colored and white.  I think the only one that I watch--I have a lot of time, television time now since I'm retired and sit.  I watch the television.  And 'American Idol.'  I had predicted that, that the white girl [Kelly Clarkson], it was down to two.  I had predicted that the white girl would win it.  But that's one of the few programs where one of us went all the way to win the cham--that title.  But in 'The Apprentice' program, it ended up that what is it--
Speaker 1: Omarosa I think--I mean Omarosa [Manigault] Stallworth.
Speaker 2: Yeah Omarosa, yeah, Omarosa and Trump.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Donald Trump.
Speaker 2: Yeah, had--was firing everybody.  And it ended up when I saw what the final two prizes were, where he's gonna build that ninety-story building in Chicago [Illinois], and that golf course on the east- on the Pacific Ocean.  I said, I just knew who was gonna win that one, yeah.  Six figure salary for that setup, I just knew the colored guy [Kwame Jackson] wasn't gonna get it.  So he just--my hope is that eventually we will be accepted for what we can do and who we are, rather than what color we are.  And that's my greatest hope.  That that day will come.  I don't think it will happen in your time or my time, but I know it won't happen in my time at ninety-four.  I won't live long enough to see it.  But in your time we--you may live to see the time when we are totally accepted for what we can do and who we are in this whole scheme of our present civilization.  I don't think it's gonna happen under the [President George Walker] Bush administration.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did your--well, why not?
Speaker 2: Why not?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I don't think--the pressure's on everybody.  I think the two people who are very prominent, two black people who are prominent in the Bush administration [HM Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice], I don't think even though they're Republicans, I don't think they are totally sold on the Bush administration.  I feel that they are going along because they--it's an almost have-to situation in order to exist in that setting.
Story_ID: 192259
Speaker 1: I sat up last night stupidly watching a program that had--didn't have any colored people involved, but this guy--I don't know what the name of this show was.  It was one of the stations--I think it was about fifty-six.  But anyway, this fella at a college had been with a group of people and they had set up a balloon arrangement over top of a college.  And when that professor broke the balloon, it spilled paint all over his new car.  And there were--the boy who started this thing was the son of a rich philanthropist.  And he--but when they had the hearing-- this one boy named Charlie [ph.] got to be the good friend and, and the escort for a guy who was blind.  Who had been a lieutenant colonel in the [U.S.] Army.  But he was blind.  But this blind guy put Charlie through all kind of tests, even to the fact that one time he was gonna shoot both of them.  He was gonna shoot the boy and shoot himself.  But when it came to the final hearing, then he had kept in touch with this boy whose idea it was.  He was the son of one of the big philanthropists for this college.  And when they, when he--when this came to the final hearing, the, the college--that boy who decided that--to do this trick, suggested that he didn't have his lenses in.  He had contact lenses and he couldn't see the people who were involved.  And but this other boy that had been with this blind lieutenant colonel, had gone through all these tests.  And they were getting ready to lay everything on this one boy.  And he got up and made a speech that set the whole college on fire, and indicated that they were destroying this one boy and letting the other three boys go because one of 'em had--the instigator of the thing had been the son of a rich man.  And so with the result that when he finished that, they said that they were not--they would destroy the rich man's son rather than this youngster who had been--he wasn't a snitcher, but he had been faithful all through this whole thing--
Story_ID: 192260
Speaker 1: Sir, did your parents [Robert Moss and Ida Byrd Moss] get a chance to see you become successful?  Did your parents get a chance to see you become successful?
Speaker 2: My--neither one of my parents ever saw that new building that I built.  My mother passed away in the early stages, and my dad lived to be--I think the building was under construction when my dad passed away.
Story_ID: 192261
Speaker 1: Now what would--what do you consider to be your legacy at this time?
Speaker 2: My legacy.
Speaker 1: Yes sir.
Speaker 2: Oh. That I have--in my years, I have always been a person who tried to work with children and even now I have a--the children of people who work here I call my little buddies.  You can see their pictures over there, that I give them birthday cards and so forth for their birthdays and every now and then one of the mothers--they are all children of people who have worked here, or are still working here.  And--but I would say that I have been the champion of youth.  That's been the thing I've always felt that I always wanted to be, to help children.  And all my life that's the biggest thing in my life has been to help children.  To see the biggest thing I--kick I get out of--is to see them grow up and be successful men and women.
Story_ID: 192262
Speaker 1: Sir, is there anything that you would do differently if you had it to do again?
Speaker 2: I guess this is stupid of me to say this, but if I had been paid for all the things that I have tried to do, I wouldn't be worried about money now.  And I'm really worried about money because living here [Heartlands at Ellicott City Retirement Village, Ellicott City, Maryland] is very expensive.  And I guess it's expensive for all older people.  My rent here, prescription medicine and trying to carry a supporting insurance like Blue Cross Blue Shield--my money's all gone.  When I came here, I had money.  But it's all gone.  And my biggest worry right now is what I--what's gonna happen to me in the next five to ten years if I live that long.  What's gonna happen to me.  And my children now support me.  They send me contributions to help me pay my rent and so forth.  So this is--that's my biggest wish.
Story_ID: 192263
Speaker 1: Our last question is similar to legacy, but how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As a guy who was friendly with everybody.  I'm--even though I'm the only black person in this setup, I'm friendly with everybody.  I have--in my six years I have been here, there's only been one person I've ever had words with because I'm colored.  So I got--I get along with everybody.  They know me as 'Doc Moss' and so I don't worry about, I don't worry about association because I don't go to all the social gatherings here.  If I wanna get involved in social things, I have very close friends in the area.  And you heard one of 'em on that telephone.  And I have another couple that take me out about once a month.  They take me out to dinners and so I'm just, I'm just friendly.  I have a lot of friends.  Another couple that are--I'm very close to, are Doctor and Mrs. Charles Ray [ph.].  Now Ray was on the faculty of Peabody [Institute of the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland].  And when he left Peabody, he went to Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  He was director of the choir, that choir that you see quite often with the president.  And from Howard University, and they live in Odenton [Maryland].  He has had some problems, he just had his hip replaced.  She called me day before yesterday and we had a long chat because he's now beginning to move around a little bit.  And, but they come to see me at least once a month.  They come from Odenton here.  And so I have a lot of friends that I've developed in the community.  So I don't worry about being social because I have--if I wanna get involved in anything that--I don't bring, even bring up things.  For instance, we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the--what was it--Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas [1954].  And at the table, I have six, five white men at the table.  And I thought this was something that they would be conversant with.  And so I brought it up at the table.  The one guy supposed to have a Ph.D. in engineering, his name is Winslow [ph.].  And I brought it up at the table one morning.  And he said, yes I read about that.  And that is as much of a discussion as I've been able to get out of any of them.
Speaker 1: So you like to be remembered as somebody that tries to get along with others then.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That's the big thing.  I get along with everybody.
Story_ID: 192264
Speaker 1: Well, the young fella on there is Crud Ayers.  He is Randy Ayers' father.  And he was one of the big basketball players and volleyball players in the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] that existed before the new building.  And then a girl--I think her name was Ethel Smith.  I know her last name was Smith.  And we used her because she had the long hair and we didn't have a lot of people with long hair back in those days.  But that is the origin of that folder that was developed for--to raise money to build this new building.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: The drawing of the new building, what it would look like.  And down in this left hand corner is the old house that existed before we built the new building.  Right, on the right hand side of that old house was a Quonset hut type building that housed the first gymnasium for the Center Street YMCA [Springfield, Ohio].
Speaker 2: Okay we go into this one.
Speaker 1: And this is the picture of the group.  That's taken in front of that building.  On the left there.  The picture of the group that helped to raise the money to build the new building.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: And they wanted to get me in, so I ran around, got up in the back of it.  The building cost $350,000.  They raised the money and it was paid for and everything in it before I--before it was dedicated.
Speaker 2: Use this pen to point out who's who, who's important.  Here we are.  And this is Dr. Channing--
Speaker 1: Channing [Heggie] Tobias, yes.
Speaker 2: Here you are.
Speaker 1: In the back, yeah.
Speaker 2: Right here.  And some of the other people along here you identified the first row.
Speaker 1: He was my mentor.
Speaker 2: What's his name?
Speaker 1: W. S. Smith.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And he--the building now is the Smith Moss, Smith Moss Recreation Center.  And that's the Reverend Smith who was my mentor.  He was the, the first executive, paid executive in the YMCA, Center Street YMCA.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All right, let's go to another one.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: That's my son, who's the associate athletic director at the University of Wisconsin [Madison, Wisconsin] now.  He was a captain in the [U.S.] Navy.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay, go ahead, go ahead.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was a captain in the Navy.
Speaker 2: This is your son?
Speaker 1: Yeah, my son.
Speaker 2: What, what's his name?
Speaker 1: Michael A. Moss, Michael Alonzo Moss.  And that was--what is that one?
Speaker 2: This your father and mother?
Speaker 1: That's my father and mother, yeah.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: That's my graduation picture.
Speaker 2: This is your--can you give us her name and when this was taken?
Speaker 1: Ida Byrd Moss.  And my father was Robert Moss.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: So this is Robert Moss, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And this one.
Speaker 2: That's Evelyn Louise Harmon [Moss] and the tall guy in there is me.  [HM] Alonzo Paul Moss.
Speaker 1: Here is another one.
Speaker 2: That picture is of my second wife, the first one's my first wife.  And this is a picture of me and my second wife at the bottom.  And I think the--up at the top are my grandchildren.  I don't know how many of 'em--but you have another picture of that, the one in that folder I gave you.
Speaker 1: The top are you grandchildren, right here?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: William [Moss], Walter [Moss], Thomas [Moss], Arthur [Moss], Bernard [Moss], and I'm in the back, Alonzo.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Shannon on the left, and Derek on the right, short guy.  And then the mother standing behind them.  Okay.
Speaker 1: That's me in my doctoral gown.  I don't know that those pictures are worth very much because they are-- I can't even tell you who they are.  I don't know that one.
Speaker 2: That's your father, it says Robert Moss.
Speaker 1: Yeah, see I can't see that.
Speaker 2: See it's got a round frame around it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know what to--I don't know what that record represents.
Speaker 2: It's in an article that says Veterans and Industry.  Robert Moss has held--I can't, I don't have my glasses on, has held dangerous post of cupola tender--
Speaker 1: Cupola tender.
Speaker 2: Cupola tender at the--
Speaker 1: Bauer Brothers.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right, that's him.
