Speaker 1: I'm going to ask you about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Eugene H. Dibble, Jr.] side--
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: --but we'll start with your mother's side first.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Helen Taylor Dibble.  H-E-L-E-N, Helen--H-E-L-A-N [sic.], Helen, Taylor, T-A-Y-L-O-R, Dibble, D-I-B-B-L-E.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in Tuskegee, Alabama.  I don't remember her birth date.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, figure it might have been about 1910 you think or, what do you think?
Speaker 2: Oh, I would say it would be probably 1908.
Speaker 1: Okay, around 1908, okay.  Now, what do you know about, or what can you tell us or what stories have been passed down about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace that side?
Speaker 2: Well, we had a very excellent relationship with her family in that her father and mother [Beatrice Rochon Taylor] were originally at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee Alabama], and then they went back to their home in Wilmington, North Carolina.  So, we would spend, when I say we, the children would spend--my sisters and brothers would spend the most of our summers in Wilmington, North Carolina.  My grandfather was in investments, and he had a large home on the lake in Wilmington, and then we had access to the Atlantic Ocean so, of course, that was a big enjoyment to us that every summer we would go from this type of environment and weather to a warm environment where we had swimming facilities within the river and the ocean, and what we would do is, he had a man who would take us to the ocean every day at 1:00 say, and we would spend from 1:00 to 3:30 or 4:00 on the ocean--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --then come back to the house.
Speaker 1: Well, can you give us your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: My grandfather's name was Robert R. Taylor [Robert Robinson Taylor].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, and you say he was into investments?
Speaker 2: He was investments also.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now--
Speaker 2: He was also very much into real estate.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now he's black, right?  Is he, is he African American (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, he was--he's one of, I guess, a small group of people involved in investments in those days, I guess, of black people?
Speaker 2: Well, not necessarily so.  There were a lot of people in Tuskegee [Alabama] that got involved in investments and they went to Montgomery [Alabama] and Atlanta [Georgia] to invest in houses and things but basically it was not, it was a big thing, but still they had their restrictions.
Story_ID: 627830
Speaker 1: So as far as you know, your mother's [Helen Taylor Dibble]--how far back can you take the Taylors in Wilmington [North Carolina]?  How, you know--
Speaker 2: Well, they were, I think they went back to Wilmington when we were about eight years old and they lived in Wilmington about three years prior to that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the family wasn't originally from Wilmington--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --but from--where were they from originally, or do you know where?
Speaker 2: They were from outside of Wilmington on my mother's side.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, you know exactly where or?
Speaker 2: No, I forgot the name of the place where they were from.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is a small, smaller town outside of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's right outside of Wilmington.  Actually, you could say it's Wilmington because it was almost a suburb of Wilmington.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, your grandfather, Robert Taylor [Robert Robinson Taylor], now, I take it that his son is Robert Taylor [Robert Rochon Taylor] the architect?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Here in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right, right, who was, he was a Tuskegee architect, and--who built a lot of the buildings on the campus [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and--
Speaker 2: That's correct [sic.].
Speaker 1: --then worked for the Chicago Housing Authority here in Chicago subsequently.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  He's the one that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was at the Rosenwald [Rosenwald Apartments; Michigan Boulevard Apartments, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 1: Yes sir.
Speaker 2: --he was head of the Rosenwald.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is the Robert Taylor that the Robert Taylor Homes [Chicago, Illinois] were named for?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, and from what, did you know, now this would be your uncle, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, my uncle.
Speaker 1: Your uncle, okay.
Speaker 2: My mother's brother.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.  So how many brothers and sisters did they have?
Speaker 2: There was Henry Taylor [sic.] who had a haberdashery store here in Chicago, and there was Robert Taylor, and those were the two Taylors.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, and your mother, was she, was she the youngest or the oldest or?
Speaker 2: She was the oldest--no, she was not the oldest, Bea Taylor [Beatrice Taylor Robinson] was the, was the oldest [sic.].
Speaker 1: Okay, then came--
Speaker 2: That was my mother's sister.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So then your mother came next?
Speaker 2: My mother came next.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  All right.
Story_ID: 627831
Speaker 1: I know a lot has been written about Robert Taylor [Dibble's maternal uncle, Robert Rochon Taylor], the architect.  Do you have any stories about him and--
Speaker 2: Well he did a lot in Chicago [Illinois].  He was very well respected here, and he was very instrumental in building a lot of properties around the Chicago area, especially with the Rosenwald [Rosenwald Apartments; Michigan Boulevard Apartments, Chicago, Illinois] and Ida B. Wells [Ida B. Wells Homes, Chicago, Illinois], he had some involvement with that.  And he had involvement with a building downtown.  He was active in real estate completely, as well as banking because he had Illinois Federal Savings and Loan [Illinois Federal Savings and Loan Association; Illinois Service Federal Savings and Loan Association].  He was president of Illinois Federal Savings and Loan, which they established there at the Rosenwald.
Speaker 1: Okay, you remember about the time period that they established Illinois Federal Savings and Loan?
Speaker 2: I was a kid (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  So that would be in the, in the '30s [1930s], I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was back in the forty--
Speaker 1: --forties [1940s] or '30s [1930s], '40s [1940s]?
Speaker 2: Early '40s [1940s].
Speaker 1: Early '40s [1940s], okay, all right.  Now I've read that Robert Taylor did not like the concept of the high rise projects, and--though they named them for him, after he passed away?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Is that true that--
Speaker 2: That's true, he didn't like the high rise apartments.  That's the reason all the low rises are over at Ida B. Wells.
Speaker 1: Right.  Now he used to supervise the projects at Ida B. Wells, right?  At the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 627832
Speaker 1: Are there any stories about your family back during the period of slavery or Reconstruction?
Speaker 2: Well, my family did not have sla- were not slaves and my great-great-grandpa- parents were in investments and had businesses, businesses that were very well run during that period of time and they really had no problem with this, especially on my father's [Eugene H. Dibble, Jr.] side.  My grandfather [Eugene H. Dibble, Sr.] owned most of the land in downtown Camden, South Carolina where he had investments in different types of businesses.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is in Camden--
Speaker 2: Camden, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: --South Carolina, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  That was my father's home.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, what, can you give us the name of your great-grandfather?
Speaker 2: He was Robert R. Taylor [sic. Andrew Dibble].
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now were they related to the, some of the white people in that area?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Not that I know of (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, well I'm just looking, I'm looking at you and you have like--
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: --you have, your hair's straight, you've got blue eyes and, you know, I was, and I've seen pictures of Robert Taylor, I just wondered if--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --if there was a relationship at all.
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But they were free black people--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --free people of color before the Civil War?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how they, they became free?
Speaker 2: Well, my great-great-grandfather [sic. great-grandfather] just demanded, I mean, he was a large landowner and he has successful businesses and he was able to give employment to minorities and he was always able to be very independent, and this is the same way with my parents.  I was just telling somebody the other day, they were, when--from Tuskegee [Alabama], they would go to Montgomery, Alabama to Atlanta [Georgia] to shop.  Well if my mother [Helen Taylor Dibble] went to Montgomery, Alabama, I mean, it was just like opening up a carpet, a white carpet for her because she was not segregated at all and everybody knew that she was black and, of course this was true with a lot of other faculty members of Tuskegee Institute [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  They could go to Tuskegee and were treated royally, and it was very interesting.  So we really did not witness in the South the major types of, of segregation that happened.  And not only that, which I tell everybody, that our father was a physician.  He was head of the John A. Andrew Hospital [John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital] at Tuskegee.  White people from all over the South who would get sick came to Tuskegee Institute hospital because of the caliber of medicine that they got.  No segregation whatsoever.  And it was very interesting throughout life that there on one day they had segregation and the next thing you know they're at the John A. Andrew Hospital getting medical attention.
Speaker 1: Now, I've heard that the, some of the hospitals, the black hospitals down south, treated whites but they had segregated waiting rooms.  Was that true at Tuskegee?
Speaker 2: We had no segregation, no anything.
Speaker 1: You didn't.  So white people would come and they would sit in the waiting room with black people and wait?
Speaker 2: They would stay in the hospital until they got well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean, they'd come from around the--Montgomery, Selma [Alabama], all of those small towns, Opelika [Alabama], Auburn [Alabama], and this just happened to be the case.
Story_ID: 627833
Speaker 1: I've got to go back some 'cause I was trying to find out how your family got free in the first place.  I mean, assuming that they were slaves at some point, like most African Americans--Africans brought here in this coun- to this country, to this country, you know, to be slaves.  Is there a story about how they became free?
Speaker 2: Well, my great-great-grandfather [sic. paternal great-grandfather, Andrew Dibble], as I understand it, worked for a white family, and he wasn't a slave or anything of that nature, he was paid minimum wages, and he was able to bail this white family out of financial trouble that they had and was able to not only help this particular family that he was working with, with some other families--
Speaker 1: Now wait a minute now.  Wait a second.  You're saying that he worked for them----
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and got a minimum amount of money but he was able to bail them out.
Speaker 2: Bail them out, when they--
Speaker 1: How is this possible?
Speaker 2: --when they got in financial trouble.
Speaker 1: How was that possible?  I mean, how is it possible for your employee to bail you out?  Did he save a lot of money or what happened?
Speaker 2: He showed them ways that they could recuperate their investments and was able to go in, negotiate deals where they were able to raise money.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they--
Speaker 2: It's an unbelievable story, (laughter) but that's the way it was.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is during slavery?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so there's a, I mean during the period (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There's still slavery down there.
Speaker 1: --the period of slavery.
Speaker 2: Slavery hadn't ended yet down there (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, it, yeah, I'm just trying to figure out--
Speaker 2: Yeah, this was during the period of slavery.
Speaker 1: Okay, so there's not a story where, where your family was freed by anyone or bought their freedom or--
Speaker 2: No, they weren't, they weren't freed by anyone, they were born free (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so you can't go back far enough to when they might have been slaves, or you don't think they ever were (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They never were, they never, now they--
Speaker 1: Is the story that they came here free?
Speaker 2: We have never been able to trace any heritage back to being slaves.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: That makes sense.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, when my father [Eugene H. Dibble, Jr.] was, was--on Sundays, he would leave the hospital [John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital, Tuskegee, Alabama] and he would go out in the country in Macon County [Alabama] and drive around the country and he'll take us with him and this was a big upheaval in my home because my mother [Helen Taylor Dibble] would always get upset that he had taken us after we had been to Sunday school and we were in our Sunday finest and everything.  Well, in the country, we'd get all dirty and that was the end of that suit, but my father would treat these patients, white and black, say for maybe three or four hours on a Sunday afternoon and not charge them anything.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it was quite an interesting upbringing to have that experience where we intermingled with both impoverished blacks as well as the whites that lived in this area.
Story_ID: 627834
Speaker 1: Your grandfather [Eugene H. Dibble, Sr.] was fairly well off?  He had money, right?  As an investment--I'm assuming he had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.  So your father [Eugene H. Dibble, Jr.]--
Speaker 2: He made money.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, and your father, he grew up in Wilmington [North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: My father?
Speaker 1: Yeah, did he grow up in Wilmington?
Speaker 2: No, my father grew up in Camden, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Camden, South Carolina.
Speaker 2: My mother [Helen Taylor Dibble] grew up in Wilmington, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So your father grew up in Camden, South Carolina?
Speaker 2: Camden, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: He went to Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], then when he left Atlanta University, went to Howard medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] and then he came to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and, when did you say your father was born?
Speaker 2: I didn't say.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't remember the year.
Speaker 1: Okay, well do you have a guess?  Was it before the turn of the century or, or after?
Speaker 2: Right around the turn of the century.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, did he talk about growing up in Camden, what it was like for him?
Speaker 2: He was sixty-eight years old when he died in '72 [1972].
Speaker 1: Okay, did he have any stories of growing up in Camden and what it was like?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, he had stories.  We'd go into Camden also.  We'd go from Tuskegee [Alabama] to Camden then to Wilmington, North Carolina and, well, in, also in that triangle was Sumter, South Carolina where we had a home and we would spend the summers there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did--well, so he didn't, he didn't pass down any stories or you can't remember any stories that he told about growing up?  What did he like to do or what, or--
Speaker 2: Well, when he was growing up, as I said, his father had a business in Camden, South Carolina, and he worked in the stores in Camden, and then he got exposed to the medical profession and went to Atlanta [Georgia] where he worked for a while, and then he went to medical school.
Speaker 1: Okay, but he went to Atlanta University first and then went to Howard, to medical school to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well was it, did he have, ever talk about what it was like in medical school or--
Speaker 2: He did not have a rough time of it.  He said it was just like anything else, they ran into segregation and everything but it was to the limited amount.  See, because, whites respected institutions like Howard University [Washington, D.C.], Atlanta University, Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] and they were there--never had any problems in that area.  They still had segregation and families and things could not, well I shouldn't say all families were segregated, there were those families that whites recognized who would have the freedom of going to the store in Atlanta, go in a restroom if they had to go to the restroom.  Of course, they'd have somebody standing out the door while they were in the restroom and everything and make sure there wasn't any trouble or anything but they still had the same ability to do anything a white person had to do.
Story_ID: 627835
Speaker 1: Let me go to your mother's side, well your fa- well, let's see.  We went to both, yeah, we've gone to both sides, let's see.
Speaker 2: I was mixing both in there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, we kind of mixed them both in there, didn't we?  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how did your parents meet?
Speaker 2: They met at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  They met--my father [Eugene H. Dibble, Jr.] went down to Tuskegee, and my mother [Helen Taylor Dibble] was there, and that's where they met.
Speaker 1: Was your father then teaching at Tuskegee?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Or was he in charge of the hospital [John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital, Tuskegee, Alabama] or?
Speaker 2: He went down to work in the hospital and then he became medical director of the hospital on the campus which was the major hospital with infantile paralysis unit.  And also he was at the veterans' hospital [Tuskegee Veterans Administration Medical Center; Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System East Campus, Tuskegee, Alabama] where he was director of the veterans' hospital also which was one of the largest veterans' hospitals in the country.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, was he a general practitioner or did he have a specialty?
Speaker 2: He was the surgeon--
Speaker 1: Surgeon, okay.
Speaker 2: --but also a general practitioner.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So at the time they met, he was a doctor in the hospital and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Was she a student, your mother a student?
Speaker 2: She had finished.
Speaker 1: She had finished?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now--
Speaker 2: She had been to Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee].
Story_ID: 627836
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Helen Taylor Dibble] talk about growing up and what it was like for her?
Speaker 2: Well, she didn't have any, any particular problem either because, as I said, her father [Robert Robinson Taylor] was so well respected in the area.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well I'm not necessarily talking about problems--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but, you know, what, you know, what did she like to do?  What was her profession?  I mean, she became a--what was she interested in?
Speaker 2: Well, she was, when she got married, and she became a housewife, but she also became the hostess for probably everybody that came to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] because of the relationship she had with the college and they would call upon her to be host, a hostess to dignitaries and things that would come to Tuskegee and dignitary--wives' dignitaries would come from all over the country every year in April for meetings and medical meetings and different types of things.  But it was a constant thing all year and she acted as the hostess for most of those things.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she, she acted as, yeah, you said the hostess for dignitaries.
Speaker 2: In other words she had the ability to handle them.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: That's what--she had the exposure, I should say.  Her father gave her that type of an exposure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 627837
Speaker 1: When did your parents [Helen Taylor Dibble and Eugene H. Dibble, Jr.] marry?
Speaker 2: I forgot what year.  It was in the late '30s [1930s].
Speaker 1: Late '20s [1920s]?
Speaker 2: Early--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was it early '30s [1930s], I mean, early '20s [1920s] or--'cause you were born in '29 [1929], so--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, early '20s [1920s], I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Okay, there we go, all right, okay.  Well any rate, so they met and fell in love and got married.
Speaker 2: They must have married in '27 [1927]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that's when they married.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: No, it was (unclear)--it was '27 [1927], '25 [1925], they probably married.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 627838
Speaker 1: Who do you think you take after the most, your mother [Helen Taylor Dibble] or your father [Eugene H. Dibble, Jr.]?
Speaker 2: My father.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: Probably because I spent a lot of time with him and traveled throughout the county [Macon County, Alabama] and the city and towns and things with him and spent most of my time at the hospital [John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital, Tuskegee, Alabama] working in various jobs and things.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, do you have any other brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Yes, I have a brother [Robert Dibble] in Washington [D.C.], who's a physician.
Speaker 1: Okay, just one brother?
Speaker 2: I have one brother.
Speaker 1: Okay, is he younger than you?
Speaker 2: He's younger, two years younger (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 627839
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, tell us this story.
Speaker 2: We were in Camden [South Carolina], and we all wanted to go to the movies and so my other cousins were there also, we were having a family reunion, that type.  So the young people decided they were going to go downtown to the movies.  So we went downtown to the movies, and we went in the first floor and sat down.  And these white kids came in and said, "You niggers can't sit here and can't stay here."  They said, "If you want to see the movie, you go upstairs."  And so, we got up and said, "Well, I would suggest that you go upstairs."  And by that time, somebody had gone and called the police, and they came from everywhere because they knew a race riot was setting to take place, and the guy came in proudly, the chief of police had said, "You can't mess with those people; they own the place."  Say, "You all got to go upstairs."  (Laughter) And I'll never forget that, and they went upstairs.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, so you're saying your, your family owned the theater?
Speaker 2: We owned the theater.
Speaker 1: Okay, now this is all unusual.  It's unusual that we have this much (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We owned the land and theater.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  That's, that put you in a different position than a lot of African American people in those days and now too.
Speaker 2: But I never will forget that experience.  We'd gone down there and bought all our candy and lollipops and things, came in there, ran into that.  We thought we were going to have to battle it out, but the people straightened it out right quick (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's interesting.  So, in your--well, was your theater considered the colored theater for the town of Camden?
Speaker 2: Upstairs floor was considered the colored part of it, where colored people could go.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was their signature, colored people can go upstairs. They couldn't go downstairs.
Speaker 1: Okay, but that was even true in the theater that your [paternal] family owned?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because, you know, at that time, we didn't have that much problems, but when we started to become of age, then this is when this happened and we went down there and that's when we had this run in and from then on we never had any problems.
Speaker 1: Okay, so people, black or white, could come in and sit?
Speaker 2: People, black or white, could come in and sit where they wanted to sit.
Speaker 1: And about what year is this when this happens?  What do you think?
Speaker 2: That was in the '40s [1940s].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.  Well--
Speaker 2: Early '40s [1940s].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, so your family's pretty well off is what we're saying, I guess, or fairly well off by a lot of standards.  Your father's [Eugene H. Dibble, Jr.] a doctor, mother's [Helen Taylor Dibble] got a college education [from Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee], you're at Tuskegee [Alabama], you've got a--ancestors had owned, I mean, your relatives owned a lot of property in Camden even then (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.  Um-hm.
Story_ID: 627840
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Oh, I can go all the way back when I remember getting in the car with my father [Eugene H. Dibble, Jr.] when I was a very young kid, seven, eight years old, and just as I said to you before, when he'd go out and go out into the country, he had patients all over the county [Macon County, Alabama], but there were these people that were really impoverished who couldn't afford to come to the hospital [John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital, Tuskegee, Alabama] and he would go out to see them and this is what he would do every Sunday, and it gave us great experience in meeting the kids and playing with them and social- socializing with them and everything else while my father was treating them, and it was quite an experience.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was a great thing to do.  As you look back over the years how you were able to meet these people and to get along with them and have such a good relationship with them.
Story_ID: 627841
Speaker 1: Did your father [Eugene H. Dibble, Jr.] deliver babies and such too or did--?
Speaker 2: At one time he did, but he didn't after a certain point in his life.  He was primarily a surgeon, and as he got larger staff members, he would relegate them to--.  You see, they would have a clinic [of the John A. Andrew Clinical Society] at Tuskegee Institute [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], on the campus every year.  Blacks from all over the country would come to this medical clinic, and they--it was quite an experience because this was considered one of the hubs of really socializing and intermingling and getting to know what was happening in the medical profession.  And white companies would come to this clinic and deliver papers and make presentations and, you know, bring them up to date on current activities and things.  But it was completely integrated; no segregation whatsoever.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, but the, okay, so--
Speaker 2: I can list a bunch of doctors from here in Chicago [Illinois] that came down there.
Speaker 1: Okay, but it was primarily for the black doctors?
Speaker 2: Primarily for the black doctors.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: All right.  Is this like, is this--
Speaker 2: It was a medical convention.
Speaker 1: Yeah, is it part of the National Medical Association?
Speaker 2: No, this was independent--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --completely.
Speaker 1: Completely different from--?
Speaker 2: Completely different.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, you know, you know what I'm talking about, the National Medical--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I know.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 627842
Speaker 1: You were in a very rich environment growing up, and--on the campus of Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and then not to mention the vacations to Wilmington [North Carolina] and Camden [South Carolina] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We lived on the campus.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you lived right there.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Some of the sights and smells?
Speaker 1: Sounds and smells.
Speaker 2: Sounds?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, let me say this, that on the campus of Tuskegee, se- there's no such thing as segregation.  You got to meet and greet a lot of people from all over the world and oftentimes when the president of the campus wasn't there, then my mother [Helen Taylor Dibble] and father [Eugene H. Dibble, Jr.] would act as the host for visitors and things.  Therefore, you got a tremendous amount of experience in meeting people and greeting people.  And living on the campus was an experience in which, itself, of what was going on on the campus, and then when the war [World War II, WWII] came along, my father was asked to go to the veterans hospital [Tuskegee Veterans Administration Medical Center; Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System East Campus, Tuskegee, Alabama] as head of the veterans hospital.  Therefore, we had to have two homes: one on the grounds of the veterans hospital and then one on the grounds of Tuskegee Institute.  And--
Speaker 1: Where was the veterans hospital in proximity to Tuskegee?
Speaker 2: About two miles.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Two miles.
Speaker 1: And from what I understand, there was a hospital at Tuskegee [John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital], and then there was the veterans hospital two miles away then, right?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: The two miles away was--the hospital at Tuskegee Institute that was on the campus of Tuskegee Institute.  Then there's the veterans hospital, which was two miles away where we moved and they had four thousand patients at this hospital, and they had patients coming in from all over the country to this hosp- I mean, not--all over the South coming to this veterans hospital.  Therefore, my father had to move out there and we lived on the grounds of the veterans hospital for X number of years, but he would still go back and forth to the, Tuske- Tuskegee Institute hospital and help them out also.
Speaker 1: Now, now did the veterans hospital treat black vets as well as white?
Speaker 2: Yeah, sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The white vets would rather come to Tuskegee than to go anywhere else.
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, at the veterans hospital?
Speaker 2: At the veterans hospital.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, not on the campus but at the veterans hospital.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, white veterans would come there and the black veterans would come in too?
Speaker 2: We had no segregation on the VA hospital--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at the VA hospital.
Speaker 1: So the VA was, you know, completely integrated?
Speaker 2: Completely integrated.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now there was a VA hospital just thirty miles away down in Montgomery, Alabama [Montgomery Veterans Administration Hospital; Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System West Campus], and they would bypass that to come to Tuskegee Institute--come to Tuskegee VA hospital.  We had over fifty doctors there.
Speaker 1: Fifty doctors, now that's a lot, that's a lot of doctors.
Speaker 2: I know, fifty doctors.
Story_ID: 627843
Speaker 1: Did you ever meet Dr. Charles R. Drew?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Many times.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he was a friend of your father's [Eugene H. Dibble, Jr.], and?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, a very good friend.  He'd come to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] every year.
Speaker 1: Well who were some of the other friends--what was he like, first of all, before we move off of him?  What was Dr. Drew like?
Speaker 2: He was a very brilliant doctor, well respected throughout the country, and, you know, he was an average guy, but he was very well known and was an excellent physician.
Speaker 1: Now, you've heard the story that they tell about how he died and--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You haven't heard that story?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: About the car accident--
Speaker 2: Well, I've heard that, but nobody's ever been able to prove it.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, you don't recognize that one as categorically true or false?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  Who were some of the other friends of your father's and mother's [Helen Taylor Dibble] that came to campus?
Speaker 2: Roscoe Giles [Roscoe Giles, Sr.] from here [Chicago, Illinois] was very--Walter Crump [Walter Gray Crump], a white doctor out of New York [New York] was one of the foremost physicians in the country, came there every year.  I can go down the list.
Speaker 1: Can you?  Go (laughter)--that's why we're, that's why we're taping so you can go down the list, so go ahead.
Speaker 2: There were, there were so many of them.  There was Dr. Thornton [ph.] and three or four Dr. Greens, Dr. Anderson [B.J. Anderson], Dr. Branche [George Clayton Branche, Sr.] who was there at the VA hospital [Tuskegee Veterans Administration Medical Center; Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System East Campus, Tuskegee, Alabama], Charlie Drew, Alf Thomas [Alfred E. Thomas, Jr.] out of Detroit [Michigan].  Oh, I could down--
Speaker 1: Okay, but you said they had an annual clinic [of the John A. Andrew Clinical Society] where people would come down to--
Speaker 2: Every, every, my father have a clinic every year.  And that, the purpose of that clinic was to integrate and to exchange information as to the medical profession.
Speaker 1: Okay, new, new information?
Speaker 2: New information and things of that nature.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And the ability to help and exchange patients, see different patients and recommend patients where the specialty was needed.
Story_ID: 627844
Speaker 1: You see most of the patients at Tuskegee VA hospital [Tuskegee Veterans Administration Medical Center; Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System East Campus, Tuskegee, Alabama] were mental patients, about 80 percent of them.
Speaker 2: I didn't know that.
Speaker 1: They had about four thousand.
Speaker 2: Now what was the cause of the--just various mental problems or, or any--
Speaker 1: People coming back from the wars.
Speaker 2: Okay, I know there's a condition they call, shell shocked.
Speaker 1: Shell shock.
Speaker 2: Was that what the general term--
Speaker 1: Oh, that was the general term, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But that's another very amazing thing.  A lot of these guys were, mentally, very disturbed and people would have problems with them, but we could go on the wards and get these patients, take them out of the hospital room, take them to the tennis clubs, take them to the baseball ground and they'd have a wonderful time.  We'd have to take them back and they'd go off just like that.
Speaker 2: So they'd get angry or violent or--
Speaker 1: They'd get very violent.
Speaker 2: These were primarily, what, World War I [WWI] vets?
Speaker 1: World War I and some World War II [WWII].
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  So when, but when you were a small child, they were like World War I (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) World War I, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Did they tell stories about what happened to them in the war?
Speaker 1: Oh, sure.  They'd tell you the stories and everything.  But I think one of the things that was successful in the treatment of those people were the fact that they were, be allowed to go to sports activities off the campus--I mean, off the grounds of the VA hospital and go to Tuskegee Institute [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] to football games and basketball games and things and, of course, they had to go with security and, and in veterans hospital buses and things, but they'd be just as normal as normal could be.  Then they get back to the wards they'd go berserk again.  So, interesting, and we as kids, I mean, we'd swim with them all the time.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's--so did your parents really have to kind of watch out, you know, for the patients, or did they feel any--?
Speaker 1: Well, of course there were attendants watching them all the time so, I mean, they weren't allowed to be loose.  I mean, there might be twenty, twenty-five patients with four guards, I mean, not guards but attendants but there would always be, have attendants with wherever they went who could act and control 'em.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But it was very fascinating to the fact that--a little story.  We had a grand piano in our home and I often think of this story.  My mother [Helen Taylor Dibble] wanted to put down new carpeting in the living room and so she told my father [Eugene H. Dibble, Jr.] and asked my father to get some patients to come over and lift up the piano.  This one guy who was maybe about 4'8" got up under the middle of that grand piano and lifted it straight up on his back.  (Laughter) My mother nearly went berserk.  She could just see her piano going.  I never will forget that story.  (Laughter) And they got one end of the rug moved, the other end of the rug moved and got the rug--.  Finally, they came in and brought a whole entourage and picked up the thing from him, but that was something.
Speaker 2: He just lifted it up by himself?
Speaker 1: Lifted it straight up, lifted it straight up.  I never will forget that.
Story_ID: 627845
Speaker 1: What were you like when you were a little kid?  I mean, what were you interested in as a little boy and--
Speaker 2: Playing football, tennis, basketball, horseback riding.
Speaker 1: So you could do all that on the campus [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  We had horses on the campus, cows on the campus, everything.  I had a horse that would come to my house every morning, from the barn, and be there when I came out ready to go to school, and I'd ride him to school and then he'd go back to the barn 'til I got out of school, then he'd be standing right at the, after school, waiting for me to ride him back home.
Speaker 1: Well, did you have to train him or did he just kind of--
Speaker 2: He just got, you know, I'd ridden--going through this routine with him before and then some of the people, the attendants would take the horse and take him back.  I would ride with her, but he got used to it and he used to do that every day.
Speaker 1: So he knew what to do?
Speaker 2: He knew exactly what to do.
Speaker 1: Well, what was his name?  Did you have a name for him?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Did you have a name for him?
Speaker 2: Yeah, his name was Charlie.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that horse was crazy about me 'cause I took him everywhere.
Story_ID: 627846
Speaker 1: Tell me about your earliest school memory.
Speaker 2: Well, I went to kindergarten and grammar school on the campus of Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  And--
Speaker 1: Do you remember your first day at school [Chambliss Children's House School, Tuskegee, Alabama], what it was like?
Speaker 2: Somewhat.  You know, you got all your friends mingled together and fight for seats and things and who's going to sit next to who and all that and I remember that we started a big fight in the (unclear), who's going to sit where and this teacher came through, boy, with a whip, straightened us all out (laughter).  So that was the end of that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you have kindergarten at Tuskegee or?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Everything right on the campus.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, did you go to preschool or just, or did you start with kindergarten?
Speaker 2: I start--well we had a preschool, but it was just a number of people, number of kids under two teachers.  Yeah, we had that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so could you read before you started school or did you?
Speaker 2: I was reading a little bit, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I started reading when I was about four years old.
Speaker 1: Okay, so were books a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: No, mostly magazines and things; that was my interest at the time.
Speaker 1: What kind of magazines did you like?
Speaker 2: Well, we always had Time, Newsweek and things like that in the house.  And then I got a lot of magazines on automobiles and things.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you have--now you grew up, you were born in 1929?
Speaker 2: Nineteen twenty-nine [1929].
Speaker 1: You grew up during the Great Depression.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: You know, every year of it.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: So, did you have a sense that something was wrong?  I mean, you were born into it (laughter)?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't, no, I wasn't that smart (laughter).  No, no, but I remember the woman that took care of us from the time we were born to the time we went to kindergarten and first grade.  Her name was Will [ph.].
Speaker 1: That's her last name?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: That was her last name or?
Speaker 2: No, that was her first name, Will.
Speaker 1: Woman?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she used to take care of us, and then we had another woman that took care of the girls [Dibble, III's sisters, Helen Dibble Cannady, HistoryMaker Clarice Dibble Walker, and HistoryMaker Ann Dibble Jordan].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now did you like school?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I enjoyed it.  It was a lot of fun.  You know, it was educational, but at the same time we had a lot of fun.
Speaker 1: Okay, well what was your favorite thing to do?
Speaker 2: Well, primarily going to play basketball during our breaks and playing other kinds of sports during the breaks and things, and then some teachers who really attracted your attention you got to, I did a lot of reading under some of 'em.
Speaker 1: Did--now did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: I liked chemistry.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I graduated from college [Lincoln University, Lincoln University, Pennsylvania] with chemistry degree (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So when you were a little kid, is science, you liked science better?
Speaker 2: Yeah, science, um-hm.
Story_ID: 627847
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was Dr. Carver still around on campus when you--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He lived right up the street.  He used to come to dinner at least three times a week.
Speaker 1: So what was he like?  What are your memories of Dr. George Washington Carver?
Speaker 2: He was a character.  He'd go all out in the country in that horse and wagon and look for various things.  I'd go with him and ride with him and the fellow that was driving the wagon, and he would try to teach you various things.  He was always trying--always trying to teach us something new.
Speaker 1: Do you remember learning something (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He and Henry Ford were very good friends.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you meet him too?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I used to see him all the time.  You come to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], he had to see us--
Speaker 1: What was he like now?
Speaker 2: 'Cause we were right there on the campus.
Speaker 1: What was Henry Ford like?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: What was he like?
Speaker 2: He was quite a guy, and he loved Dr. George Washington Carver, spent a lot of time with him.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And he'd bring his whole family down there.  They couldn't get over it.  They weren't coming into a segregated community.  We'd put him up right at Dorothy Hall, that was the hotel on the campus and there was no segregation there.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did, did he use some of the science that George Washington Carver developed to, for Ford Motor Company [Dearborn, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, especially his paints and things on his automobiles.  That was his great interest, yeah.
Speaker 1: So what kind of a, I heard that George Washington Carver had a very high voice.  Is there any, is that true?
Speaker 2: He did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Very high pitched.
Speaker 1: I've also heard he would talk to the plants, or he said the plants talked to him, or did he ever talk about that with you?
Speaker 2: Well, he talked to his plants, no question about that.  He'd talk to himself many times too, walking down the street.
Speaker 1: Well, did people consider that odd or did they, just part of--
Speaker 2: They got used to it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They got used to it.
Speaker 1: That's something he was going to do.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: That's something he was going to do.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, he would talk to himself.  He was a strange character.
Speaker 1: Now, I had a friend, a friend of mine was on the basketball team that toured the South, and he said he hurt his knee.  He was from Xavier University [Cincinnati, Ohio], and he said he hurt his knee and when he went to Tuskegee, George Washington Carver gave him a salve for his knee that healed it up and--
Speaker 2: It healed it up right away.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what he said.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well he always came out with something new.
Speaker 1: So, do you have any stories like that about him, about him developing something?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was, he was known for that.  As I said, he used to go out in the country all the time and see people and visit with 'em and talk to 'em if they had--he wasn't a physician but he carried all these different types of salves and things.  Joe--Henry Ford used his salves all the time.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, did your father [Eugene H. Dibble, Jr.] use products that were developed by George Washington Carver, too?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) okay.  So, he, what was his attitude about it?  The way you said it, "No, he wouldn't do it," is--
Speaker 2: I mean, it wasn't that they were good things, but my father just felt that he couldn't take the risk of treating a patient with something that had not been registered.
Speaker 1: Okay, something that wasn't a bona fide medicine.
Speaker 2: Bona fide.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 627848
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were just telling stories about George Washington Carver off camera, but you were telling me one interesting fact is that you said he had a lot of girlfriends.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, he was very well known for that on the campus [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].
Speaker 1: 'Cause I don't think he ever got married, did he?
Speaker 2: No, not that I know of.  I'm sure he didn't.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, but he had his share of girlfriends?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, so that may put to rest rumors of the two (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He would come to my house for dinner many times and he'd bring a guest with him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you said, you were saying just before we started rolling that he had a lot of strange kind of ways with--what did you mean by that?
Speaker 2: Like he would go out and pick up plants and things and walk out in the woods and pick 'em up and we'd go out in this horse and wagon and pick up various things, you know, to just, well off the beaten path.  So, he was very strange in that way.  He was very methodical though on what he picked up and did.
Speaker 1: Okay, and I was commenting about him being very humble.  Do you have any examples of his humility?
Speaker 2: You come in the door, he'd--waiting, open the door and make sure you got through, that was the type of person he was.  And he was very well respected.  And they used to have a tremendous number of whites that came to the campus and he'd spent time with them, talking with 'em and eating lunch with 'em at Dorothy Hall, at one of the dining rooms on the campus and he was very helpful to anybody he could help.
Story_ID: 627849
Speaker 1: Who was president of Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: When what?
Speaker 1: Who was president of Tuskegee Institute when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, there was, in my early days, there was a Professor Walker [ph.] who was president [sic.].  Then there was a fellow by the name of Reid [ph.].  I don't remember the other presidents.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were long after Robert Moton?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Moton had passed away--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --by that time and he, he succeeded Booker [Booker T. Washington]--
Speaker 2: I knew him.
Speaker 1: Did you?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I knew him, yeah.
Speaker 1: But he lived there on the campus even though--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they lived right at Dorothy Hall.
Speaker 1: Okay, what was Robert Russa Moton like?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head) He was a terror.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) How so?
Speaker 2: I mean, he was very informative, and yet he wanted things his own way.  You ever run into a person like that?  And he had things, and wanted his own way, and he and my father [Eugene H. Dibble, Jr.] would get into it all the time and, you know, nothing serious or anything but they had their opinions and they fight and fuss and talk the night away and go to another day.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's the way he was.
Speaker 1: Now did they, on campus did they talk about Booker T. Washington?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: And what he was like when he--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they always put Booker T. Washington up in church services and things like that when guests would come.
Speaker 1: At the convocations and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now he died in 1915, right?  Yeah, and so this is like about fifteen years after he had passed that you came along?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, so people still had fresh memories of him then?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, they, they had memories.  There was a guy there by the name of Washington who lived until he was about ninety, he died in the '40s [1940s], I believe, and he was very close friends of him.
Speaker 1: Okay, and he shared the same last name?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Washington?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any stories about Booker T. that were shared?
Speaker 2: He would go all over the campus, inspecting and always trying to see what he could do to better the campus and improve the conditions of the campus and things of that nature.  That's one of the main things that he was noted for.
Speaker 1: So he's very active in terms of walking around the grounds and--
Speaker 2: Very active.  As I say, he'd go over to the hospital [John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital, Tuskegee, Alabama] and talk with my father at length and he would talk with other people on the campus.  You know, he was always and continuing to bring up subjects of interest that could better the campus.
Story_ID: 627850
Speaker 1: Now from what you say, you were very, you and your father [Eugene H. Dibble, Jr.] were very close and you often accompanied your father on, you know, when he would treat patients out in the outlying area (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, we would--he would take us every Sunday, out in the country and this is when he would go out to see patients who couldn't afford to come into the hospital [John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital, Tuskegee, Alabama] and who didn't have the money to see him in the first place and he'd go out and treat 'em three or four hours and they'd all congregate around.  Sometimes we'd end up out there five or six hours.  My mother [Helen Taylor Dibble] would raise hell when he brought us home.  And he just believed in helping those that couldn't afford to be helped.
Speaker 1: Did he ever pass on a philosophy of service to you and your brother [Robert Dibble]?  Did he say--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, he always sort of said (laughter), we practice that today.  We do a lot for, you know, people that are impoverished and we still do that, at least I still do it a lot.  My brother's a little bit tighter than I am (laughter), but I've always believed in that philosophy, and he's the one that taught me that.
Story_ID: 627851
Speaker 1: Now you were on the campus [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] up until, I think the, was it the second year of high school, then you went to a boarding school, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you attended Monson Academy (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Monson Academy.
Speaker 1: And where is that?
Speaker 2: Monson, Massachusetts [Wilbraham and Monson Academy, Wilbraham, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was up there for two years.
Speaker 1: Okay, now how was, how was that transition?  How did you feel about going to Monson?
Speaker 2: Monson was a good experience and good exposure.  You got to meet a lot of people from a different environment.  I played basketball there, and it was a really great experience.  I made a lot of friends.  It was about thirty miles outside of Springfield [Massachusetts] and we'd go over to Springfield a lot on the weekends and over to Hartford, Connecticut.  In other words, you got a chance to see--go around and see various things and various people.  There were only two of us at the school, minorities, so--
Speaker 1: Both African Americans?
Speaker 2: Two of us, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, two.
Speaker 2: The rest were whites, and they were very nice.  They'd take us around and things.
Speaker 1: Okay, so was it a culture shock to, you know, when you first got up there or did you, or did--
Speaker 2: Oh, I was ready to come home when I first got up there, but, you know, I started playing basketball and football and got involved, and we made a lot of friends.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were there for the last two years of high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, how did your grades do up there?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: How were your grades in Monson?
Speaker 2: I was B minus, C--C plus, made some B pluses; I did well.
Speaker 1: Okay, now when you decided to go to college--I mean, well, when you were in, I guess at Monson, did you, did you get involved, you played basketball, did you do other activities?
Speaker 2: I played football too.
Speaker 1: Football too, okay.
Speaker 2: I played some tennis too.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you have, were there any special teachers or mentors there?
Speaker 2: There were three teachers there which I liked very much and they helped me a lot too.  I've got--integrated into the school and meeting people.
Speaker 1: Can you remember the names of any of them?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head) (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, but they were, what did they teach?
Speaker 2: They taught mathematics.  They taught English and one taught medical, medical--I'm trying to, it wasn't medical, it was medical drawings, that's what it was.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.

Speaker 1: Were you thinking about becoming a doctor yourself at this point?
Speaker 2: Not at that point, no.  I didn't know what I wanted to do at that point.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did your father [Eugene H. Dibble, Jr.] want you to become a doctor or did he try to push you that way?
Speaker 2: He didn't really try to push me that way, but he wanted me to become a doctor, yeah.  But (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, now how did you--
Speaker 2: I went to the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], was working in medical school, and I just got fed up with medicine.
Speaker 1: So you did that during the summer or--
Speaker 2: During the summers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I just decided I didn't want to go through that.
Speaker 1: What was it that you didn't like?
Speaker 2: Well, I think it was, at that time, it was being tied up so much and having to spend so much time as my father did, his time wasn't his own.  And I felt I wanted a little bit more out of life.
Speaker 1: Okay, so now, how did you wind up choosing Lincoln University in Pennsylvania [Lincoln University, Pennsylvania] as a, as a college?  Did you think of going back to Tuskegee [Alabama], or--
Speaker 2: No, a couple of friends of mine were going to Lincoln, and then my father got sick and that's the reason why I left at the second year, I went back.
Speaker 1: Okay, the reason why you left Lincoln was because your father--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --became ill?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, let's just talk about Lincoln for a minute before we go back.  But were the, what was your major at Lincoln?
Speaker 2: Chemistry.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And were there any major teachers or mentors at Lincoln that you remember?
Speaker 2: There was a fellow by the name of Harris [ph.] who taught me.  There was a guy by the name of Townsend [ph.] that taught me.  Those are two I can remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were, are there any stories about Lincoln?  Did you pledge a fraternity or anything or did you--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I used to get off the campus as much as I can, I went to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] on the weekends, and I really didn't want to get tied up in the fraternities because I didn't want to say I was one person's friend, not another person's friend.  I tried to make friends with all of them and, as I said, I spent a lot of time in Philadelphia on the weekends.
Speaker 1: Now did you like music?
Speaker 2: I liked music, but not to the extent that I, you know, stopped to do something, and then I'd go to Washington [D.C.] where I had friends.  So, it was quite a good experience but I didn't like the isolation of being way out in the country.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Story_ID: 627853
Speaker 1: When your father [Eugene H. Dibble, Jr.] became ill, you went back to Tuskegee [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: I went back to Tuskegee.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Helped my mother [Helen Taylor Dibble] out.
Speaker 1: So was he, was he, was he very-very--well, he must have been pretty bad off?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was having difficulty.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he wasn't able to work I take it then?
Speaker 2: On a limited basis.  You couldn't stop him from seeing his patients, and that's what, the reason why I went back to try to take him away and get him, doing other things rather than just being in the hospital constantly, every day, seven days a week which he was doing.  And my mother wasn't feeling well at the time so I went back home.
Speaker 1: So this is what, about nineteen forty what?  Four [1944] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Forty--no, '48 [1948].
Speaker 1: Forty-eight [1948]?
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, now this is--now, this is after the war [World War II, WWII] then, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, so you were at Lincoln [Lincoln University, Lincoln University, Pennsylvania] during the, during the--were you in high school [Monson Academy; Wilbraham and Monson Academy, Wilbraham, Massachusetts] and at Lincoln during the war?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was at Lincoln during the war.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 627854
Speaker 1: You got involved with the aviation program at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Advanced Flying School], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And tell us how that happened.  How did you--?
Speaker 2: Well, as I said, first, they started first with a, a guy by the name of Chief Anderson [Charles Alfred Anderson] who came down out of Ohio and--
Speaker 1: Is he the one from Wilberforce, or?
Speaker 2: Yeah [sic.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He came down and we became friends, and I'd go out and he'd let me fly on occasions, and he taught me to fly.
Speaker 1: So what were you flying?  What kind of plane did you?
Speaker 2: Piper Cubs [Piper J-3 Cub].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we'd fly around the campus, and around the town and go back out.
Speaker 1: You say, so you weren't afraid to fly?
Speaker 2: Oh, no.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I've heard a lot of people, you know, from that era say they were, they wouldn't fly and some of the soldiers wouldn't even fly back from the war [World War II, WWII] because they were afraid to fly.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's true.
Speaker 1: They would take the boat back.
Speaker 2: That's true.
Speaker 1: But you were, you weren't afraid?
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  Well let's see.  I first started working at the airport in 1941.  As a matter of fact, a woman over here on 49th Street [Chicago, Illinois], Ollie Flowers [Olive Flowers], I used to work there at Tuskegee, in the parachute room.  She's about ninety-five now.
Speaker 1: Her name is Rollie Flowers?
Speaker 2: Ollie Flowers.
Speaker 1: Ollie Flowers, okay.
Speaker 2: Olive.
Speaker 1: Olive, okay, you're going to, can you give us her phone number when this is over?
Speaker 2: I'll get it for you.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, 'cause she needs to be interviewed, probably.
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't think you will want to interview her at this point.
Speaker 1: Okay, you think she may be too difficult to do?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  But that's, but, so she was, she was in charge of the parachute room at--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, and worked at the base at Moton Field [Tuskegee, Alabama].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the Tuskegee airfield was called Moton Field, named after Robert Russa Moton--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --who was the former president of Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: All right.  So and, so you all are flying Piper Cubs and--now this is 1941 or so (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now I flew Piper Cubs out of the old field--
Speaker 1: Oh, the one on Union--
Speaker 2: --where we just had one landing strip.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Is that the one on--
Speaker 2: That was on Union Springs Highway.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  On the road to Union Springs, Alabama.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's where the first classes started flying before Moton Field got ready.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, so this is 1941 you're saying--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And now how do you, you're still in, in school at this point, right?  You're in--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: This is, so you're about eleven, right?  Eleven or twelve?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  This is why you're still--
Speaker 2: I started working when I was nine.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Just get up every morning, nine--or four o'clock in the morning, ride out to Moton Field.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so, the, the (unclear) and the Tuskegee Airmen got started.  Now they got started around '41 [1941] or '42 [1942]?  What was it?
Speaker 2: Forty-one [1941].
Speaker 1: Forty-one [1941].
Speaker 2: Forty-one [1941], '42 [1942].
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you were about twelve years old?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you were working at Moton Field?
Speaker 2: Moton Field.
Speaker 1: All right, and now the Tuskegee (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My mother [Helen Taylor Dibble] used to drive me to work every day.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the Tuskegee Airmen got started at Moton Field, but then they created another field, didn't they, after they--
Speaker 2: Yes, that was a big field.
Speaker 1: And what did they call that one?
Speaker 2: That was--I can't remember the name but there was a field before that, it was on the Union Springs Highway, which was the first field where Piper--we used to fly Piper Cubs out of.  Then there was Moton Field where the trainees and everything first went.  Then we went over to the major base at Tuskegee, at the time--at Tuskegee Air Force base [Tuskegee Army Airfield; Sharpe Field, Tuskegee, Alabama]; that was the name of it.
Speaker 1: Okay, so at the time, did you have a sense that what the Tuskegee Airmen were doing was making history?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.  Ollie Flowers usually remind you of that every day.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  She thought that was a very historic thing.
Story_ID: 627855
Speaker 1: Now you--you were--were you there when Eleanor Roosevelt came to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  She had dinner at our house.
Speaker 1: Well tell us what happened.  Now why did Eleanor Roosevelt come to Tuskegee and what happened.
Speaker 2: She came two or three times.  She first came down there and was introduced to George Washington Carver and she got very excited about that.  She had heard so much about him, and then she came back and she came back two or three times after that.
Speaker 1: Now she had a particular interest at one point and played a pivotal role in the--
Speaker 2: Tuskegee Airmen.
Speaker 1: Yeah, public acceptance of--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --of black pilots.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: What happened on that trip?  Do you remember, had they--had there been a meeting to plan this or did she surprise you or what happened?
Speaker 2: She surprised everybody.  Somebody in Detroit [Michigan] had turned her on to it, and she came down there and first she met with the president, Patterson [Frederick D. Patterson], and they went out to Moton Field [Tuskegee, Alabama] and she said that she was going to help them develop the field and bring in people to be trained, and she did.
Speaker 1: Now, from what I've read there was a historic ride that she made in an airplane, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, to--they didn't want her to do it.
Speaker 1: Okay, they, being the--
Speaker 2: Her husband [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] and family.  Oh, man, they raised Cain.  They sent the police and everything else up from Montgomery [Alabama] to stop her from doing it, and she told them all to go to hell.  She got on that plane and flew over to Georgia.
Speaker 1: So it was--I think she rode with Chief Anderson [Charles Alfred Anderson].  Did he fly the plane?
Speaker 2: Chief Anderson.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.  And this, this subsequent publicity--
Speaker 2: Well, you know a lot about this.
Speaker 1: Well, I read a little bit about it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I read a little bit about it but, you know.  So did she stay at your house when she was there that time, on that trip?
Speaker 2: No, she stayed at Dorothy Hall.
Speaker 1: Dorothy Hall, okay.  That's the campus hotel?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.  So do you have any memories of Eleanor Roosevelt, personally yourself?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she had dinner at our house two or three times during her various visits.  She and my mother [Helen Taylor Dibble] got along very well and she, she couldn't get an understanding because my wi- my mother was so calm and cool around white folks.
Speaker 1: That was a, you're saying, well okay, what you're saying has a point 'cause that's unusual in those days--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --like, you know.
Speaker 2: And she didn't make any difference with my mother.  No, no sir.
Story_ID: 627856
Speaker 1: There are older guys there that were part of the Tuskegee--that initial group of Tuskegee Airmen, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That some of them became very famous, two I know of that you knew (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Who is that?
Speaker 1: --that I read that you knew are Chappie James and--
Speaker 2: Chappie Daniel James.
Speaker 1: And Benjamin O. Davis, Jr.--
Speaker 2: Daniel "Chappie" Jame- [Daniel "Chappie" James, Jr.].
Speaker 1: --right?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., right?
Speaker 2: Benjamin O. Davis, Jr.
Speaker 1: Daniel "Chappie"--so--
Speaker 2: Well you know, Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., his family were at Tuskegee--they lived on the campus of Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].
Speaker 1: Okay, so you knew him growing up then, right?
Speaker 2: I knew him growing up.
Speaker 1: All right, now, there is, the stories you hear about him that he was a very, he was a soldier, you know--
Speaker 2: Oh, man he was straight as an arrow.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Say, as a little kid even?
Speaker 2: Straight as an arrow.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was he like as a little kid growing up having a--
Speaker 2: He was very hard to get off--I mean, he didn't want to play any sports or anything.  Oh, he was so regimented in going to school and going home and reading his books and things.  He liked to come out and watch us play football and basketball and thing, but, and he'd go places, 'cause I shouldn't say that, but he was very restrictive as to what he did.
Speaker 1: You think it's--
Speaker 2: He wasn't secure, that's what it is.
Speaker 1: Okay, and why do you say that?  I mean, what--?
Speaker 2: He was always afraid to do something.  He was a very delicate kid and whether his parents trained him like that or what, I have tendencies to think that that's what happened.
Speaker 1: Do you think, you have the sense that his father was trying to mold him to a soldier?
Speaker 2: Trying to mold him, that's right, that's correct.
Speaker 1: Do you think they were overprotective of him?
Speaker 2: Yes, no question about that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I've heard stories that he used to sit up so straight that it looked artificial.
Speaker 2: That's right, and stand straight, that's right.
Speaker 1: So did you get a chance to be good friends with him or was he just--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, he knew me very well.  He used to come to the house all the time.  Tuskegee was a very small place and everybody associated with everybody and traveled around with everybody.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now his father, Benjamin O. Davis, Sr. now, he became a general, did he not or--
Speaker 2: He was a four star general.
Speaker 1: Four star general.  He was the, he was the highest ranking black officer--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --yeah, and I think the, previously, the highest ranked man was Charles Young, was it not?  I think Colonel Young.
Speaker 2: Carl- Charles Young.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Colonel Charles Young from Wilberforce [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, so what was General Davis, Sr. like?  Was he around much when--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, he was around a lot.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was around a lot.
Speaker 1: So was there an [U.S.] Army assignment for--had he retired or was there an assignment for him in Tuskegee [Tuskegee Army Airfield; Sharpe Field, Tuskegee, Alabama] or--
Speaker 2: He was assigned in Tuskegee.  Nobody could understand why he would have gotten that assignment, but they thought that they were going to put up a [U.S.] military base there during the war and they brought him in there.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he didn't live there before the World War II [WWII] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, because I misunderstood.  I thought you said you grew up with Jr., you know, Benjamin O. Davis, Jr.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And I didn't realize he didn't come until after the war started.
Speaker 2: He came after the war started.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, he came about 1941?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: They--okay, so they were anticipating the creation of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He actually came about '40 [1940], I think.
Story_ID: 627857
Speaker 1: Now tell us a little bit about Daniel--Daniel "Chappie" James [Daniel "Chappie" James, Jr.].  You know, he had a different kind of background than--
Speaker 2: He was a different person.  He was a very smart guy and he was very knowledgeable and he got along with everybody.
Speaker 1: Now where did he come from?  Did he, was he, was he raised on the campus too or--
Speaker 2: Mostly, yeah.  That was, he was from Florida originally.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  I think I've read where your father [Eugene H. Dibble, Jr.] had to, you know, helped him out from time to time financially or--
Speaker 2: That's true.
Speaker 1: He didn't have a lot of means.
Speaker 2: He did that for a lot of them, a lot of 'em.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: Okay, so we were talking about Daniel "Chappie" James and--
Speaker 2: Daniel "Chappie" James came from a very impoverished family and he came to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and he met a lot of the faculty members as well as my father and they helped him out and got him through.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, he was older than you or about the same age or?
Speaker 2: He was older.
Speaker 1: Older, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: But he was a good friend of ours.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 627858
Speaker 1: When you came back to Tuskegee [Alabama], when your father [Eugene H. Dibble, Jr.] was ill, I mean, what did you, I mean, well, I guess I may be going too far ahead because you were there when the Tuskegee Airmen were formed while you were still a student at Lincoln [Lincoln University, Lincoln University, Pennsylvania], right?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: So you got involved over the summers, in the summertime, is that it?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay.  So, you already knew how to fly at that point?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did--was there ever a point that you actually became part of the--or in what sense can we say that you were a part of that first Tuskegee air group?
Speaker 2: Well, first was that a lot of the first group spent a lot of time on the campus of Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and spent a lot of time in my home, knew my sister [Helen Dibble Cannady], and, or least they met my sister and Thomasine Floyd [ph.] and others.  And they tried to help them out when they originally came there.  And that's how I got to know 'em.  And, of course, I met them at the airport when they'd come out to the airport.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So I'm wondering, okay so, well, I'll just take you back to when you came back to campus, I guess, from Lincoln.  When you came back to campus full time, the war [World War II, WWII] was over then, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and are there any stories from the war that we need to talk about?
Speaker 2: Well, only to the extent that when war came, of course, this is really when Tuskegee Institute Air Force base [Tuskegee Army Airfield; Sharpe Field, Tuskegee, Alabama] really came into effect and what they had done was they originally brought students down, down to Montgomery, Alabama and, of course, that didn't work out and they brought them over to the original field on the Union Springs Highway and while they were doing that, they started building Moton Field [Tuskegee, Alabama] and that was the primary base in which the students really started flying out of and being taught.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did they, did they keep the base there after the war?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so did--you joined officially, you officially joined the--was it within the Army Air Corps [U.S. Army Air Corps; U.S. Air Force] or?
Speaker 2: Army Air Corps.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  This is in 1948, then or?
Speaker 2: Forty-one [1941], '42 [1942].
Speaker 1: Well, I'm talking about when you joined, when you got involved.  Did you join the Army Air Corps at a certain point?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: In '52 [1952].
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, so that's much--
Speaker 2: Fifty-two [1952].
Speaker 1: --much later, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, '52 [1952].
Speaker 1: So you came back to Tuskegee and graduated from Tuskegee--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --before you joined the Army Air Corps?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now what--and you majored in chemistry?
Speaker 2: Well, at the end of, end of my graduation, I became a second lieutenant in the, in the Air Corps, Army Air Corps--
Speaker 1: All right, could you--
Speaker 2: --at Tuskegee.
Speaker 1: You'd been in the ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --there at Tuske- ?  Okay, now, okay, now.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.
Speaker 2: But I was inactive after I graduated and then I went in.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 627859
Speaker 1: Were your intentions when you were in school to--was your intention to become a chemist?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So what did you have in mind as a career?
Speaker 2: Well, I liked investments, and that's what I stick with.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is, now did you get the idea for this because of your family history with property and your--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So there are already people in your family who had been involved in investments?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Your, was your grandfather still--?  Yeah.
Speaker 2: My [maternal] grandfather [Robert Robinson Taylor] was, and Robert R. Taylor [Dibble, III's maternal uncle, Robert Rochon Taylor] was very actively involved in it.  Henry Taylor [sic. Edward Taylor] was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you didn't have to be introduced to that outside of the family because it was already--
Speaker 2: No, I already knew it, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now when you came back to Tuskegee [Alabama]--I mean, as a college student, who were your role models and who, who were the teachers that made the biggest impression on you?
Speaker 2: Well, my chemistry teacher was a very close friend of mine.  His name was Hunt [ph.] and then, of course, I knew all of the teachers on the campus.  It was very difficult to not--very difficult not to know 'em and it was through family that I knew a lot of them.
Speaker 1: Okay, so in--
Speaker 2: Now, (unclear) faculty members have been at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] for years.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now what did you do when--well, you graduated at, did you graduate in chemistry?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: With a minor in math.
Story_ID: 627860
Speaker 1: What did you do in the two years before you joined the, I mean, in the interim between the time that you graduated [from Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and joined the [U.S.] Air Force?
Speaker 2: The Air Force?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I went right in in July.
Speaker 1: Oh, you went right in, okay, all right.  So you graduated in '52 [1952]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, okay, all right.  So, where were you stationed initially?
Speaker 2: I was originally stationed in Texas, and then I was stationed up in Colorado and then they brought me back to Texas and I went to, down to Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you--okay, so where were you--when you were stationed in Texas, was it your intention to become a pilot?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: And what, do you remember the base you were stationed at?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Gee--
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  Was it Lackland [Lackland Air Force Base, Bexar County, Texas]?
Speaker 2: Lackland.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay, that's in Texas.  And so you didn't intend to become a pilot?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: But what did you, what did you want to do in the [U.S.] Army?
Speaker 2: Well, I wanted to complete my commitment, really, because in college I joined the Air Force, Army Air Force [U.S. Army Air Forces] at that time, and then for, when I got out of college, I went in and I had two years to spend.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you wanted to get that commitment out of the way so you could--
Speaker 2: I wanted to get that commitment out of the way.
Speaker 1: --so you could get involved in, in investments and?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now, when you were in, I guess the--were you ever stationed overseas or--
Speaker 2: I went overseas a lot, but I wasn't really stationed over there, no.
Speaker 1: And what was the Army Air Corps [U.S. Army Air Corps; U.S. Air Force] like in terms of its treatment of black men?
Speaker 2: Well, it was just like anything else.  There was segregation, but it really, there was a core group of kids that came in at the same time, and there was only one other black in this twenty grou- number group, and we stayed together the whole time while in the service and we didn't have any problems whatsoever.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the, you all were stationed together, I mean, stayed--
Speaker 2: We were stationed together, we were transferred together and the only time we were separated was when they'd send us out on special assignments and things.
Speaker 1: Okay, and this constituted the--was this all, this group like all the black men in the Army Air Corps, I mean, the officers?
Speaker 2: Say what now?
Speaker 1: I mean this group was all the, I mean, what was, describe what the group, the group was black officers, right?  Young black officers?
Speaker 2: No, there were only four of us in there, black.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you said the whole group stayed together the whole time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the other sixteen were white.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, but they kept--
Speaker 2: We stayed together.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.

Speaker 1: So this is a time of the Strategic Air Command, I guess, and the--
Speaker 2: That's when it became Strategic Air Command and rolled over into the Strategic Air Command.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the gov- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was when General LeMay became involved.
Speaker 1: So you said earlier you were assigned to General Curtis LeMay?
Speaker 2: I was assigned to him when he came in.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what was he like?
Speaker 2: He was tough.  You never knew where we were going or what we were going to do the next day and we'd go in and kind of out of the country, go in the country, you had to be armed all the time, twenty-four hours a day with him and he was a very dedicated person to the [U.S.] military and he was a very strict disciplinarian.
Speaker 1: Okay, now was the [U.S.] Air Force in those days, I guess, was primarily concerned about attack from the Soviet Union [Russia]?  Is that true?  I mean, would you care to talk about that.
Speaker 2: That's very true.  That's when it was with the Army Air Corps [sic.] and then it split off and became the United States Air Force.
Speaker 1: Right.  So did you ever, was there ever a time when you were afraid that an attack was imminent or--
Speaker 2: I always had my bags packed (laughter), so I could go in the other direction.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay, all right.  So, are there any stories from that period of time that are significant at all?
Speaker 2: I can always figure out where to go.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean, you know, it was good in the fact that under Curtis LeMay, you had to be there when he was ready to do something and then when he wasn't ready to do something, then you had some breathing room and you could get away and you wouldn't be bothered, but when he wanted to go, you had to be prepared to go with him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now at any time did you have command over white officers or enlisted men?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: How did they take that?
Speaker 2: In other words, my transition would be from the general down through me to the other officers, that's the only way I could give them directions because their ranks exceeded mine.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you actually told, you actually gave instruction to officers who had higher rank than yourself?
Speaker 2: At the direction of the general.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In other words, he liked to keep his hands on everybody.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you had a privileged position?
Speaker 2: Oh, I tried to figure that out (laughter).  It was an easy position.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So how did they take to you giving them orders from the general?
Speaker 2: All I had to do was say it came from Curtis LeMay and that was the end of that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you didn't get any negative feedback from--
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  LeMay, he was a rough disciplinarian and everybody was afraid of him.
Speaker 1: Any stories about what he would do to you if he, if you didn't obey him?
Speaker 2: Well, he would demote you.  He'd put you out the service.  He was that type of guy.  He didn't do it to many people but he did do it to a couple of people but we were able to get 'em back in.
Speaker 1: Now were you surprised later on in life when he ran for president with, well he was going to run for president with George Wallace, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: Did that surprise you?
Speaker 2: Well, it surprised me because he had such a bad reputation that I didn't know how he even thought that he could get elected to anything.  He was terrible.
Speaker 1: I see, okay.  Okay, so--
Speaker 2: The only way I got along with him was to stay away from him 'cause we would have butted heads (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, is there any stories that, any time that you ever butted heads with him?
Speaker 2: Oh, I used to disobey him all the time.  I always had my backup cards to keep me straight from butting heads with, and that was about the time when somebody else had given me an order to do this and give me order to do that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so you knew how to deal with him?
Speaker 2: I knew how to deal with him.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I learned how to deal with him.
Story_ID: 627862
Speaker 1: You were released from duty in 19--discharged [from the U.S. Air Force] in 1954 (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nineteen fifty-four [1954].
Speaker 1: Right.  And now, why did you--
Speaker 2: July.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.  How did you manage to come to Chicago [Illinois] did you--instead of--
Speaker 2: Got here from Omaha, Nebraska, I ran out of money and couldn't go any further so I had to get a job.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what did you start doing?
Speaker 2: I went down and worked for Wayne Hummer [Wayne Hummer and Co.; Wintrust Wealth Management, Chicago, Illinois], that was an investment banking firm.
Speaker 1: Okay, now that's different for most people that just have to get a job.  I mean, it seems like you have to know somebody to start working.  So how did that happen?
Speaker 2: Well that's how you operate in this society, you've got to know somebody.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So you, now who is he and tell us who he is.
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: Wayne--
Speaker 2: Wayne Hummer--
Speaker 1: --Hummer.
Speaker 2: --was a big investment bank- one of the biggest investment banking firms here.  They were very good friends of my [maternal] uncle, Robert R. Taylor [Robert Rochon Taylor], and he made the introductions.
Speaker 1: Okay, so were you the first African American ever hired by--?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There were two of us that were hired on LaSalle Street.  I was the first one and about two weeks later another black was hired.
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  Wasn't that with Hornblower and Weeks [Hornblower and Company, LLC]?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  Wasn't that with Hornblower and Weeks?
Speaker 2: With me?
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  Hornblower and Weeks.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's who the other black was hired by?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, now who was the other black man?
Speaker 2: Andy Crawford [Andrew Crawford (ph.)].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, well what--
Speaker 2: And you know he just disappeared off the face of the earth after two years and I don't know whatever happened to him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 627863
Speaker 1: Was it difficult to get started or was it, what happened?
Speaker 2: It wasn't really difficult to get started, it was difficult in getting all the rules and regulations that you had to put up with, that was demanded by the New York Stock Exchange [New York, New York] because they have ultimate control over any investment banking house.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did they give you time to, I mean, someone had to then mentor you, I guess, to get you--
Speaker 2: Somebody mentored me and gave me the rules and regulations and things of that nature.
Speaker 1: Did it take a long time to learn?
Speaker 2: No, not really.  I was in New York [New York] twice to the main office and met with some people and learned some of the rules and regulations and things.
Speaker 1: Okay, was that the hardest part of--
Speaker 2: That was the hardest part getting in the--
Speaker 1: Was learning the regulations of--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then describe exactly what you did then for--what you did.
Speaker 2: Well, I sold stocks and bonds.  And it's very unique in the fact that in those days a good year was 6 million share days whereas today, if you do over 150 million shares, (laughter) you know, you're not in business, so that was the difference.  It was a good place for a minority to be if you had tremendous contacts around the country, and within the locale, but for the ability, I mean, to have to be competitive for 6 million shares a day with the whole organization, it was very difficult because the whites had the market covered.
Speaker 1: Okay, you were working for a white firm, though, Hummer, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) White firm, um-hm.  Wayne Hummer [Wayne Hummer and Co.; Wintrust Wealth Management, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Wayne Hummer, okay.
Speaker 2: And Hornblower and Weeks [Hornblower and Company, LLC].
Speaker 1: Now, you worked out of the board of trade [Chicago Board of Trade, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --or mercantile [Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: They had offices on LaSalle Street.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right.  What's your, was there ever a time that you thought that you really didn't want to do it anymore or you thought you weren't successful?
Speaker 2: Well it wasn't that I didn't want to do it anymore, I just had to get out and make more money other places.  I have five kids.
Speaker 1: So, there was no, were there any barriers to people dealing with you?  I mean, did they, did they--
Speaker 2: No, I didn't have any barriers dealing with people, but at that time very few minorities did anything with the stock market.
Speaker 1: Right, even today there are very few.
Speaker 2: Even today, it's a limited number.
Speaker 1: Okay, were people surprised to see that you were not white?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were very nice to me.  I can't say otherwise, but as I say, across the country, doing 6 million shares a day didn't give you much room.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, I--
Speaker 2: That was people all over the country.
Story_ID: 627864
Speaker 1: Now you wrote a column for the Chicago Defender about, about stocks?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what was your, what was the thought about, you know, thoughts of--I mean, why did you do that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I wrote two columns.  I wrote a whole article on financial community and the LaSalle Street and the exposure to LaSalle Street and the potential for the future of minorities in that field, and, as I said, there were only two of us on LaSalle Street at that time [Dibble, III and Andrew Crawford (ph.)], and I think you haven't got over ten or twelve today.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you know, I suppose you did know the circle of black people that were actually trading stocks and those who--
Speaker 2: I was very fortunate in that they gave me, they allowed me to open an office [with Wayne Hummer and Co.; Wintrust Wealth Management] out in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois] in the Hyde Park Shopping Center which I had for three years.
Speaker 1: About what year is this?
Speaker 2: That was in the '60s [1960s], and it was still slow, and whites were very limited in coming into the office.  And you didn't have that many minorities that knew anything about the stock market to come into the office, so it made it very difficult.  I mean I did some business there, but it wasn't the business--I had three other people there, and they had to be paid also.
Speaker 1: So you were there for three years?
Speaker 2: Three years.
Speaker 1: In the '60s [1960s].  Did you go back to LaSalle Street?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What did you do next?
Speaker 2: Went back and did my own investments and stayed in that, bought a couple of businesses.
Speaker 1: So what kind of businesses did you go into?  I mean--
Speaker 2: I bought Jackson Park Moving and Storage [ph.], and I bought a garage at 69th [Street] and Stony [Stony Island Avenue], and I had a couple--barbeque house on 67th Street.
Speaker 1: What were the names of the--I'm interested in barbeque house names and that sort of thing--which?
Speaker 2: That was Henry's Barbeque [ph.].
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  Piggly Wiggly [ph.].
Speaker 2: Piggly Wiggly?  No, it was Henry's first and then Piggly Wiggly.
Speaker 1: Okay, Henry's and Piggly Wiggly.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And Jackson's moving and storage, that's--
Speaker 2: Jackson Park--
Speaker 1: Jackson Park, okay.
Speaker 2: --Moving and Storage.
Speaker 1: Is that different from Jackson's moving and storage?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: This was on 73rd Street.
Speaker 1: Okay, so those are two separate businesses, Jackson and Jackson Park (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 627865
Speaker 1: At some point in the '60s [1960s], you were involved with Muhammad Ali, I've been told, so--
Speaker 2: I put Muhammad Ali in business.
Speaker 1: Okay, tell us that story.
Speaker 2: Well, Muhammad Ali was down on his, I mean, he had no money, had nothing--
Speaker 1: About what year is this?  Is this when he--
Speaker 2: What year was that, Jeanette [Dibble, III's wife, Jeanette Campbell Dibble]?
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  August, around '66 [1966]--
Speaker 2: Was he in the height of his--
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  Wasn't it when you were at New Rex Garage [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Sixty-six [1966], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, now this is after he, he's already become heavyweight champion, right?  And had he been suspended?  I--you know, I guess, you know, they suspended him from boxing for not allowing himself to be drafted, remember?
Speaker 2: Ye- well, they suspended him for not being, he wouldn't go, that's right, and he was down on his rear end and we helped him out and he would come over to the garage, I had a big garage there, and he would come in the garage and go in my cash register and act just like he owned the place.
Speaker 1: Go in the gara- in the, and take money, like?
Speaker 2: And take money and then one thing led to another, and he was able to get back on his feet.  I got him a job and got him a thing in New York [New York], and that's how he got back into business.
Speaker 1: Well, what do you mean, a thing?  You got him, what?
Speaker 2: I got him a fight.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is when he came back and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It was '71 [1971] I think he came back.
Speaker 2: About seventy- '71 [1971] or '72 [1972].
Speaker 1: Okay, so who did you get him a fight with?
Speaker 2: Liston, Sonny Liston.
Speaker 1: Oh, no, that, no that was before.  That's '64 [1964] when he fought Sonny Liston.
Speaker 2: He fought him then again, too.
Speaker 1: He fought him in '71 [1971]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Fought him in Madison Square Garden [sic.].
Speaker 1: I hadn't heard about that one.  But, are you talking about--
Speaker 2: Then he fought a lot after that.
Story_ID: 627866
Speaker 1: Tell us how you first met Muhammad Ali.
Speaker 2: I first met Muhammad Ali at our garage.  He came in there and filled up his car and didn't have no money to pay for the gas.
Speaker 1: Now this is 69th [Street] and--
Speaker 2: Stony Island [Avenue].
Speaker 1: Stony Island, okay.
Speaker 2: The garage is right there on the curb, next to the funeral home.
Speaker 1: Now, Ali lived, didn't he live in South Shore [Chicago, Illinois] then, near the lake [Lake Michigan]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --around 67th [Street] and the lake?
Speaker 2: He lived over in that high rise.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, yeah, okay.  So he wasn't that far away.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, well tell us what happened.  He came in the garage to get his car fixed?
Speaker 2: He came in and got his gas and then wanted to drive off and didn't have the money, and I put my dog on him and scared him to death.  (Laughter) He left the car.  Who was that?  Vaughn [Vaughn Chandler (ph.)] took the, Vaughn took the dog and kept him from biting him.  Vaughn's the fellow that's worked for me for about thirty-five years.  He grabbed the dog and kept him from biting Ali.
Speaker 1: So did he, what kind of car was he driving?  A big Cadillac or something?
Speaker 2: Cadillac.
Speaker 1: Cadillac, okay.  Now did you realize that was Muhammad Ali at the time?
Speaker 2: I didn't know who he was, no.
Speaker 1: You just knew he didn't pay?
Speaker 2: I knew he didn't pay, and that was a mistake making him 'cause he sure came back after that and then, during his impoverished years (laughter).
Speaker 1: So what happened when you discovered, how did you discover it was him?  Did you go out and, after they pulled the dog off?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: I mean, after they called the dog back, then you discovered it was Muhammad Ali?
Speaker 2: Somebody else knew who it was and then told me who it was.
Speaker 1: So what did you do at that point?
Speaker 2: One of my employees knew who he was.  I didn't bother him, we became friends and he hung out at the garage every day from then on.  I inherited a lot of him.
Speaker 1: You say, a lot of him, who else came by the garage?
Speaker 2: We had four or five of 'em that'd come by, didn't have any money and was down on their--
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  Was it--Mahalia Jackson's husband [Sigmond Galloway].
Speaker 2: Mahalia--
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  Morris Tynes [Morris H. Tynes].
Speaker 2: Morris Tynes.  Oh, and the list goes--
Speaker 1: So these are famous African Americans in the neighborhood, or they have some kind of fame for one reason or another, and Muhammad Ali is the most famous African American in the world in those days, he's coming by, hanging out at the garage.
Speaker 2: That's right.  That's the only way he ate, coming by and getting me.
Story_ID: 627867
Speaker 1: Okay, so you would loan him money and--
Speaker 2: It wasn't a loan, he would go and eat with me (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so you'd just buy, buy him a meal?
Speaker 2: Buy him a meal.
Speaker 1: Now what had he done?  Had he failed to invest his money when he had it?  Was that it or--
Speaker 2: I think his wife [Belinda Boyd Ali; Khalilah Camacho Ali] got his money, I know she did.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is his first wife [sic. second wife], I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's what happened.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: At least I think that's what happened.  I didn't go into it, but we've helped out a lot of 'em.
Speaker 1: Now has Muhammad Ali ever publicly acknowledged that you helped him when he--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, he's said that, sure.  He didn't have any recourse.
Speaker 1: Now did you know Muhammad Ali's biographer, Dick Durham [Richard Durham]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause I know he worked over at the paper [Chicago Defender].
Speaker 2: He died, didn't he?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes sir.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He worked over at The Final Call--or was it Muhammad Speaks [Muslim Journal] then, I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I knew him.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now I'm just trying to figure, is this the end of the Muhammad Ali story.  Are we done with him now or what?
Speaker 2: Muhammad Ali was really a very good hearted person and he helped out a tremendous number of people.  All you had to do was ask him for something.  You know, when he got back on his feet and thing, all you got to, had to do was ask him and then of course he had his brother [Rudolph Clay; Rahman Ali] who was a big drain on him, but he was a good guy.
Speaker 1: Okay, so do you still stay in touch with him?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I think he--
Speaker 2: I tried to get rid of all those that were in my pocket (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Did you, did you ever advise him about investing his money?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How to invest?
Speaker 2: But at the time, he didn't have any money to invest when he start- really started coming around us, and then we got him back in the ring and that's what got him on his feet.
Speaker 1: Okay, so when you say you got him a fight, so did you promote him with your own money?
Speaker 2: No, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I brought two people in who put him back in the ring.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they provided--
Speaker 2: No, I didn't want to do anything with boxing.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you know Truman Gibson [HistoryMaker Truman K. Gibson, Jr.] here?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, sure.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause he was a boxing promoter and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He tried to get Muhammad Ali for a while, he couldn't.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you know Don King?
Speaker 2: I knew Don King.  I know 'em all.
Speaker 1: Now did you ever hang out with Ali's entourage when they would--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.  They were too much for me.  I knew 'em all though.
Story_ID: 627868
Speaker 1: You were married by then, right?  You (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you were--now, now you've been--well tell me how you met your wife [Jeannette Campbell Dibble].
Speaker 2: She came looking for me.  Just like she did there.
Speaker 1: She doesn't have a mic, either (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We met in Texas.  I was in the [U.S. military] service in Texas [Lackland Air Force Base, Bexar County, Texas] and we met down in Texas.  She had come down there for some convention or something, and I was in San Antonio [Texas], I went over to Houston [Texas] and met her and we went to the beach down in Texas and from then on it's turned into a marriage.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is in 1952 or '3 [1953] or?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  (Laughter) You better remember that.
Speaker 2: No, that was in '55 [1955], '55 [1955].
Speaker 1: I better ask you a different question 'cause I don't want to get you in trouble.
Speaker 2: Fifty-five [1955].
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 627869
Speaker 1: Now you've been a part of like the black business network in Chicago [Illinois] for a long time.  And how is it organized?  I know there was at one time it was something called, I know they had the millionaires club, there are different clubs and groups of black businessmen here.  Now talk about, can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: Well, they tried to establish businessmen having clubs and things.  They used to have a meeting once a month and a luncheon or something once a month and it lasted about three months and then they, everybody got to arguing and everything and--
Speaker 1: About what time is--what time period is this?
Speaker 2: This was back in the '50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then it went on into the '60s [1960s] and it started to do it again, to organize a group.  It never, you could never get anybody to sit down and really work out a program as to what the end results were going to be and what they were going to do, and originally the thought was help impoverished people as well as help the youth in getting them exposed and things, and we had meetings for a while from time to time, and then it just fell apart.
Speaker 1: So who would come to the meetings?  Would John Johnson [HistoryMaker John H. Johnson] come or--
Speaker 2: John Johnson would come.
Speaker 1: Dempsey Travis [HistoryMaker Dempsey J. Travis].
Speaker 2: Dempsey Travis, Truman Gibson [HistoryMaker Truman K. Gibson, Jr.], all that group.
Speaker 1: And [HistoryMaker] George Johnson?  Was he--
Speaker 2: George Johnson didn't come.  He was more of a loner.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 627870
Speaker 1: Any of the Muslim businessmen that were--let's see, Elijah Muhammad?  Any of them involved?
Speaker 2: I represented Elijah Muhammad for a while (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: I gave him, I got that house for him over on Woodlawn [Woodlawn Avenue, Chicago, Illinois], got the three houses across the street for him that he built.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you negotiated the deals that, that--?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That must have been, that's quite, now who owned that house before Elijah Muhammad got it?
Speaker 2: It was owned by a white family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now he, that must have been in the--
Speaker 2: Do you remember who owned that house?
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  Tell him about Ali's house.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was right across the street, right, from Elijah Muhammad?
Speaker 1: Yeah, diagonally across the street.  Yeah, he had a big house there for a while.
Speaker 2: I think your wife [Jeannette Campbell Dibble] thinks there's a story there, right?
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Can you tell the story?
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  Let's--when he married Veronica [Veronica Porche Ali] and you helped him to buy that house at 50th [Street] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Forty--49--
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  Yeah, 50th and Woodlawn.
Speaker 2: Fifty.
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  Uh-huh.  And you got this, the people to come in and design it and they gutted the house.
Speaker 2: I bought that house for fifty thousand dollars and--
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  Now it's worth--?
Speaker 2: Worth 2 million.
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  (Unclear) million.
Speaker 2: Right, I, all the real estate over there is, is worth a million.
Speaker 1: I bought that house for him for fifty thousand dollars.
Speaker 2: So, you basically identified the house, bought it and had it gutted and rehabbed--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --for Elijah Muhammad?
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  No, it's for--
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: For Ali.
Speaker 2: --that's for Muhammad Ali.
Speaker 1: Muhammad Ali, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  So this would have been in the--
Speaker 2: Muhammad--Elijah Muhammad bought a new--built a new house.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So this would have been in the, in the late '60s [1960s], early '70s [1970s] or?
Speaker 2: Late '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: Now did the businessmen ever come together and form a organization (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, could never get 'em together.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  What about Seaway Bank, Gene [HistoryMaker Eugene H. Dibble, III]?
Speaker 1: I founded Seaway Bank, too.
Speaker 2: Okay, well tell us, tell us that story.  How was that done?
Speaker 1: The bank came up for sale, and I was out there one day and so I said, no, I wasn't interested in it.  And then next day I was talking to somebody and they said that they might be, want to put a group together, so I went back there and got a thirty day temporary agreement on the sale of the building.  And I got some people involved in buying it, they went into it and opened the Seaway National Bank [Seaway Bank and Trust Company, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Now, Seaway was, was it the first black bank in Chicago [Illinois]?  I mean, well it couldn't be the first but--
Speaker 1: Seaway was the first.  No, it wasn't the first, it was second.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The first bank [Guaranty Bank and Trust Company] was there on Stony Island [Stony Island Avenue, Chicago, Illinois].  What's that, right across from the garage?
Speaker 2: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  I don't remember the name.
Speaker 1: I know the building you're talking about 'cause it's, it's empty now, yeah.
Speaker 2: Right across from my garage.  Yeah, that was the first and I put Oscar Williams [Oscar S. Williams] in there, in the bank.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you set that one up too?  Or--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, the one on Stony?
Speaker 2: The one on Stony Island.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that was before Seaway?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was before Seaway.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know there were other black banks in the '20s [1920s] and that sort of thing but at one time Chicago had what, Seaway, Independence [Independence Bank of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Had eight banks.
Speaker 1: Eight black banks?
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: Okay, that's more than I thought.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it had three on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois].  They all fell through.
Speaker 1: I think, Seaway may be the only one left or it was.
Speaker 2: Well, the bank on 67th Street closed, and then Seaway was the last bank that stayed and it's still solid.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're thinking about Drexel [Drexel National Bank, Chicago, Illinois], was that it?  Drexel closed.
Speaker 2: Well Drexel was white.
Speaker 1: Was it?  Okay.  I thought that was black.
Speaker 2: Drexel wasn't black.
Speaker 1: So did you, did you remain on, did you have a position on the board of Seaway Bank?  You never (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I never wanted to be on the board of anything.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you just helped put it together?
Speaker 2: I put it together.
Story_ID: 627872
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, why didn't you want to be on the board of these institutions?
Speaker 2: Because they didn't agree with my philosophies.  My philosophy was making money first, and then being important second, but they had the philosophy of being important first and then making money.  That wasn't my philosophy.
Speaker 1: Can you, can you give me an example?
Speaker 2: See, I had five, I had five kids to feed, and that's the reason why I don't join any organizations to this day 'cause you get in and make all kinds of commitments and things and nobody lives up to the commitments, and then the organization--it's just like you just said.  I mean all these people were, would say they wanted to get together to do something, they wanted Al Boutte [HistoryMaker Alvin J. Boutte, Sr.] and all of them, and look at Al Boutte.  Al Boutte started out with me.  I put him in two deals, and all of them went down the drain.  He wouldn't take care of them.  I don't even know where Al Boutte is now.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he used to be in charge of Independence Bank [Independence Bank of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] at one time, right, as president?
Speaker 2: At one time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: That's where he started out, and then he opened his bank on 47th Street.  So--
Speaker 1: Well he retired, he's, he's retired that's right.  What happened to him?
Speaker 2: You think he retired?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.  But, so--
Speaker 2: How can a man retire and still not be out socializing?
Speaker 1: Well he's not well.
Speaker 2: Oh, is that it?
Speaker 1: That's part of it.  Yes sir.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: Is--one other--I don't want to miss anything here 'cause you've already surprised me a few times now with, you know, being a hand behind things I did not know anything about.  So, is that in itself something that--I mean you say you like to stay out of the, kind of stay out of the spotlight.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Story_ID: 627873
Speaker 1: So what else?  Don't, don't--'cause I don't, I confess I don't know.  What else did you do?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Oh I got into a lot of things.  I helped people open up a place out in Gary [Indiana], the Gary National Bank, bought by a black guy, did very well with it for a while and then it just went down the tubes, and he had everything going for him.  So I've been involved in a lot of things, but I always know what the end results going to be, so I just stay out of 'em.
Speaker 1: So, are you still making deals today?
Speaker 2: I still make deals occasionally.
Speaker 1: Okay, so would you consider yourself, today, like semi-retired or--
Speaker 2: I'm retired.
Speaker 1: Retired, okay.
Speaker 2: My wife [Jeannette Campbell Dibble] retired me.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).  So what was your biggest deal?  What's the biggest deal you made?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  What is the biggest deal?
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  The Ali [Muhammad Ali] fight with Frank Fried.
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah.  That was the biggest, that was the biggest money maker.
Speaker 1: Ali's fight with Frank, Frank Fried?
Speaker 2: Frank Fried was one of the promoters of the fight.
Speaker 1: Okay, he was, okay, all right.  So that was the biggest deal of all?
Speaker 2: I took in $62 million.
Speaker 1: So, well I'm not going to ask, well maybe I shouldn't ask you, or maybe I should ask you, how much did you get out of that?  How much did you make then?
Speaker 2: Well I made a very small amount, very small amount.  And probably (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But that's the biggest deal in total.
Speaker 2: And probably I couldn't do it, really be involved in it 'cause I would have had a conflict of interest at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 627874
Speaker 1: Do you advise young black people that are trying to get involved in the stock market or investing (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I tried to advise them, but it's very difficult in talking to 'em and getting anybody committed to doing anything.  I mean, there are golden opportunities out here now for blacks to really take over.  53rd Street, for example, the Hyde Park bank [Hyde Park-Kenwood National Bank, Chicago, Illinois] there, a black had an opportunity to buy that.  The deal was all put together, and just at the last minute he walked away from it.
Speaker 1: Why do you think he walked away?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I don't know, but he had the money.  He had the money and just walked away from it.  And that was seven years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay, is there any specific advice you would give people in finance now, younger people that want to get involved?
Yeah: go out and take advantage of every opportunity they can.  There's so many opportunities out here now that minorities can move into and take advantage of 'em but you're--they're too afraid to do it.  They don't want to take the risk.  There's risks involved in any investments that you take, but they just don't want to take the risk.
Speaker 1: Think people are looking for a sure thing.
Speaker 2: Looking for sure things and there's no such thing as a sure thing out here anymore.
Speaker 1: Okay, and as we sit here today, what do you think about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I understand there's a girl, a woman that just made a bid on the Seaway National Bank [Seaway Bank and Trust Company, Chicago, Illinois].  I don't know who it is, but I just heard that last week.
Speaker 1: Black woman?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  As we sit here today, what's the financial climate like?  I mean, is it, is it, do you see opportunity or do you see problems with the mortgage crisis and all that, you know?
Speaker 2: I think that you're going to see a downturn for the, for the next six months to a year but I think during this period of downturn, just like I told my brother [Robert Dibble] last night, I said, "Go ahead and buy all the stocks you can buy now 'cause they're not going to stay down.  They're going to turn around and come back.  Just buy 'em and put 'em away."
Story_ID: 627875
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: I'm too old to think about that (laughter).  I think about the whole community now (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, well, when you look back at every (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I mean--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I'm not being facetious, but I mean it's the truth.  I mean, you'd be amazed at the number of people that you help out and turn around, and they don't take advantage of it.  I mean, all of the things that are out here now that are in trouble, if black people don't have the sense enough to go in and buy, this tide's only going to go down so far and it's going to turn around and come right back up and it's going to be greater than it's ever been.  Ford's [Ford Motor Company] not putting all these people in here for nothing.  Ford's trying to expand their business here.
Speaker 1: So you're saying that we have the people that have the money?
Speaker 2: You've got the people that got the money.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause a lot of people don't think we have any money.
Speaker 2: Yeah, a lot of people got money.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But you know what?  They're happy to sit down and look at it and count it every night and go to bed.
Speaker 1: So, not taking enough risk with the money you're saying?
Speaker 2: That's right.  And you can't do that because eventually you're money's going to run out 'cause if you don't have something to compound the money that you got, you're going to fall down on the end somewhere.
Speaker 1: So is this--is your financial philosophy something that was passed down in your family?
Speaker 2: Well, not really, but I got a lot of experience from my [maternal] uncle [Robert Rochon Taylor], and this is the philosophy it is.  I mean, there's just opportunities out here all over the place.  You look what's happening right now.  You get in your car and go and drive from 12th Street to 47th Street and see how many whites you run into.  They're all over the place, all the way from State Street to Lincoln Park [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: And we're talking about in places where they weren't before, right?
Speaker 2: Where they weren't before.  They're moving here and taking over.  In five years, there won't be any black people in that area.
Speaker 1: This is the area that a lot of people refer to as the low end and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: It's the best area in the city.
Speaker 1: East Side of Chicago [Illinois], near the lake [Lake Michigan], right?
Speaker 2: That's right, and you can't beat it.  Where I live on 32nd Street, I can be downtown in ten minutes.  I can be anywhere on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] in five minutes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so we're--
Speaker 2: And it's going to do nothing but increase in value.
Story_ID: 627876
Speaker 1: When you look back at everything you've done to this point, is there, is there any major thing that you would have done differently when you look back at it?
Speaker 2: Sure, I would have gotten me a bunch of white people and put them together and taken over everything (laughter).  That's what I should have done instead of helping our brother, and that's the truth.  But there's some aggressive, young black females that are coming out here that are doing things.  Have you heard about that?
Speaker 1: I've, I have heard about aggressive, young black females, yes I have.
Speaker 2: They're all over the place.
Speaker 1: Okay, is that--
Speaker 2: You see, every night I go out and meet and talk to somebody and I learn something and you learn what's happening.
Speaker 1: Where do you go?
Speaker 2: Oh, I go all over, go all over.  People afraid to go in the streets at night, I'm right there.  I ride all up and down State Street, Wabash [Wabash Avenue, Chicago, Illinois], anywhere.  You can get along with people.
Story_ID: 627877
Speaker 1: Let me ask you, I'd be remiss if I didn't ask you about the time period when Harold Washington was the mayor of the city [Chicago, Illinois].  Was that a big opportunity that we missed, or did we take advantage of that?
Speaker 2: That was a golden opportunity we missed.  We never should have turned it back, but we didn't have nobody to replace Harold Washington.  We were all fighting against each other.
Speaker 1: So you're saying that, are you saying that his position as mayor made it possible for a lot of things to happen?
Speaker 2: Sure it did.
Speaker 1: He facilitated (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He opened a lot of doors--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but he never got the credit for it.  He gave a lot of people jobs and put them in good places.
Story_ID: 627878
Speaker 1: Have you ever considered running for office?
Speaker 2: No sir.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't want any parts of it.
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  But you did run for office.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  You told him about that already?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did.
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  You were commissioner.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was commissioner of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, no he didn't.
Speaker 2: I was commissioner of the water reclamation [Metropolitan Sanitary District of Greater Chicago; Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago]--
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were commissioner of the water reclamation--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --district?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I couldn't afford to stay there.
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  But tell them about the election, Gene [HistoryMaker Eugene H. Dibble, III].  Tell them about how you ran for election and how--you're always telling me how many votes you got.
Speaker 2: Which one?
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  When you ran for the Republican with Chuck Percy [Charles H. Percy], and you ran--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I got--
Story_ID: 627879
Speaker 1: Okay, Mr. Dibble [HistoryMaker Eugene H. Dibble, III], there are a couple of questions we wanted to ask, make sure we ask before this session was over.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I want to ask you about Muhammad Ali's encounter with the Blackstone Rangers [Black P. Stone Nation] in your store.  Now this is in the mid-'60s [1960s], I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well what happened?
Speaker 2: Blackstone Rangers came in there to rob the store--the, it was a garage and they came in to rob--raid the place and Muhammad Ali was over in the office where the cash register was, and I was across the hall in another office and I heard all this commotion out there, and I had a dog by the name of Spot who it was barking and raising Cain.  So I got up and walking and here these Blackstone Rangers were in there, going to take over the cash register, they're going to rob everybody and take over my garage.  So I went back in and got my pistol and shot it up in the air and gave 'em two seconds to get on the ground.  And that was one of the issues that we had with Muhammad Ali in the garage.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did they get on the ground?
Speaker 2: They got on the ground--
Speaker 1: And what did you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and kept them there 'til the police got there.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so you basically told the police that they tried to extort you--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --extort money from you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and this is a serious situation.  I think your wife [Jeanette Campbell Dibble] was telling us in the break that a woman next door was shot in the leg by the Blackstone Rangers, right?
Speaker 2: That's right.  They were tough out there.
Speaker 1: Do you, do you know anything about the situation--there's a story that I've heard that they took over the Oakland theater [Oakland Square Theater, Chicago, Illinois] at one point and they just took it over, just moved into it and took it over.
Speaker 2: They did, they did.  And one of them got shot and then six of 'em got put in jail around that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I remember that.
Story_ID: 627880
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  Was the blizzard important to tell 'em about, Gene [HistoryMaker Eugene H. Dibble, III]?  The blizzard of '67 [1967]?  Ali [Muhammad Ali] wasn't involved, but what happened when the--the blizzard of '67 [1967].  What did the garage do?
Speaker 2: I can ask on the mic.  What about the blizzard of 1967?  What happened?  Now that's one of the most famous weather events in Chicago [Illinois] history.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, we had a big storm and then everybody got locked in and nobody could go out and, and--
Speaker 2: But the snow was to the, over the tops of cars, right?
Speaker 1: That's right but we were able to get out and--
Speaker 2: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  What did the garage do with the firemen?
Speaker 1: Oh, we had the fire trucks and everything in there.  They had to come--move into our place in order to respond to a fire.
Speaker 2: Now this is, this garage you have, we're talking about a, kind of a big cavernous kind of garage, right?
Speaker 1: Hundred car garage.
Speaker 2: A hundred car garage, okay.  Yeah, 'cause I've been in, I've been in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 69th, 69th [Street] and Stony [Stony Island Avenue, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Um-hm, it's a huge place.
Speaker 1: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay, so the fire department used it for emergency vehicles?
Speaker 1: Yeah, they came there.
Speaker 2: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  'Cause they were snowed in at their place, right, Gene?
Speaker 1: They couldn't get into their place so they came--we let them come over our place.
Story_ID: 627881
Speaker 1: Tell me about the election in 1966 to the Chicago water reclamation district, and I think they called it then the Chicago sanitary--
Speaker 2: Sanitary district [Metropolitan Sanitary District of Greater Chicago; Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) district, right.  So, how did you decide to run, why did you decide to do that and, and what was the election like?
Speaker 2: Somebody talked me into it.
Speaker 1: Who was it?  Who talked you into it?
Speaker 2: I think it was Don Palmer [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He talked me into running and I ran and got elected by seven hundred and some thousand votes and--
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  Was it difficult?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was very difficult.
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  Why?
Speaker 2: And I spent six years there.
Speaker 1: Okay, well why was it difficult to be elected to that?
Speaker 2: Well, there was a lot of competition.  Everybody wanted to get into that position.  A lot of people wanted to have that position.
Speaker 1: Now was--Chicago [Illinois] in those days were, was described as being run by a machine, the Democratic machine under Mayor Richard Daley, Richard J. Daley?
Speaker 2: No, this was county [Cook County, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Hm?
Speaker 2: This was county.
Speaker 1: This is county, okay, but still the, he ran the county.  He had the county commissioner too, didn't he?  As from what I understand?
Speaker 2: Daley had, well Daley had most of the city and the county.
Speaker 1: It was a Democratic machine was running things.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: That's what I'm trying to establish.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And then was that your opposition or did you, were you a part of the machine when you--
Speaker 2: I wasn't a part of the machine, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  You ran off a Republican ticket.
Speaker 1: I ran on the Republican ticket.
Speaker 2: Thank you, thank you (laughter).  You act- so you were definitely not part of the Democratic machine--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --you ran as a Republican, right?
Speaker 1: I ran Republican.
Speaker 2: Okay, so your opposition was the Democratic machine?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And it was a mighty machine.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That won all the elections out here--
Speaker 1: That's correct.
Speaker 2: --for the most part.  In fact, were there any other Republicans in county office when you were in office?
Speaker 1: There was two.
Speaker 2: Two, yeah, that's--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I think by that time most of the Republicans, and especially the black ones, have been pushed out of office, like Sammy Rayner [A.A. "Sammy" Rayner] and other people who were prominent.
Speaker 1: All of them got put out.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  There was one time, there was one time when all the blacks in Chicago were Republicans.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: But that time is past, long time ago.
Speaker 1: They get all outside in the early '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: Okay, now I understand the drama of that story.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's quite a victory in the face of that kind of opposition.
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  Do you think you won because of the black vote that you, that you got, went around to all the churches, night after night?
Speaker 2: That was probably the reason because I had been active in the community.  You see, I'd been a volunteer for the American Red Cross and the Salvation Army, and I was out in the streets at night and day and a lot of people knew me, and they were very helpful to me.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they were voting for somebody that they knew--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and they knew they could trust.
Speaker 2: You see, I used to respond to all disasters as a volunteer in my younger days.
Speaker 1: So, so you wouldn't, what I gather here, and correct me if I'm wrong, that it wasn't just you personally volunteering but you would volunteer your resources as well?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Yes, sir, all right.
Story_ID: 627882
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would have done differently if you could?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess I would have made more money.
Speaker 1: I did ask you that question before, didn't I--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --and you said you would have--
Speaker 2: Made more money.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And taking care of these five kids I got (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think you said you would have organized some white people (laughter)--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --instead of--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: The other thing we ask, too, is that at this point in your life, when you look back at everything you have done, and a lot of this is hidden from people, a lot of people don't know what you've done, then when you look back on all of that, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well see I never went before the newspapers, or got involved with the newspapers, the radio, televisions, I wasn't looking for glory, I was simply out there to help somebody.  And I didn't need the, all the other stuff that goes along with these things.  But it was very pleasing to me and I enjoyed it and I was able to help people that was less fortunate than I was.  I spent a lot of time doing it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  Tell him about the lady at the post office that you see all the time.
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: There's a lady at the post office that you know.
Speaker 1: There's this lady at the post office.  Every time I come by there, she begs, and she goes there just like she goes to work, just like they're inside, she's outside.  So I give her a dollar, two dollars and so the other day I got, oh, about a month ago, I got over there and didn't have any money.  I said, "Now, you give me some money."  And she pulled out and gave it to me and gave me five dollars.  I went on in the post office, took care of my business (laughter), she said, "Now don't forget me," (laughter).  But I had a lot of fun with her.
Speaker 2: That's a great story.
Speaker 1: But she's there every day, begging.
Story_ID: 627883
Speaker 1: Tell us about your family.  Now, we always--tell us about your wife and children and--
Speaker 2: Well, you know my wife, you heard her, she's the boss here, and she gives out the directions.
Speaker 1: What's her name?  You have to give the names.
Speaker 2: Jeanette.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Jeanette, Jeanette Dibble [Jeannette Campbell Dibble].  Then I got five kids: Rochon [Rochon Dibble], Chyla [Chyla Dibble Evans], Andrew [Andrew Dibble], Gene [Eugene H. Dibble, IV] and Hillary [Hillary Dibble Baltimore], and they're all in various businesses of their own and they're all successful, so, I'm grateful for that.
Speaker 1: Do you have any grandchildren?
Speaker 2: Yes, I got a few.
Speaker 1: I'm not going to ask you to name all of them but (laughter)--
Speaker 2: I got a few grandchildren.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now were your parent- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They say I'm getting too old so I can't take 'em out to the stores and things but I'm able to sneak 'em out now and then.  I take the young ones to the--
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  Ask him to tell you about this picture.  I don't know if he can see it.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Your wife gave us this picture.  Can you tell us about this picture here?
Speaker 1: Who is this?  Oh, these are my grandchildren.
Speaker 2: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  Is that your favorite role?
Speaker 1: Yeah, they were in the motor home and we were going on a trip.  They all passed out on me.  But I spent a lot of time with 'em, taking them to various places and things.  I enjoy them.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Take them to lunch on Saturdays.  But three--what is she, three years old now?  Two and a half?  Two--I took her to lunch here at the Four Seasons the other--a couple of weeks ago on Saturday and then she wanted to go shopping.  Now, how can a kid that age know what she wants?  And what's she want some dresses for?
Speaker 2: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  I wasn't there.
Speaker 1: (Shakes head) They always got something.

Story_ID: 627886
Speaker 1: Now, Mr. Dibble [HistoryMaker Eugene H. Dibble, III], we want to go back to a little bit of history about you.  When we last talked to you, you had gone through your family history, up through your [U.S. military] service.  I wanted to ask you a little bit more about when you came to Chicago [Illinois] and how you got involved in the stock brokerage business.
Speaker 2: Well, I came to Chicago in 1954.  I had just gotten out of the service, and I decided I wanted to go into investments, so I went down and applied for a position, and I was very fortunate in being able to be retained by Wayne Hummer [Wayne Hummer and Co.; Wintrust Wealth Management, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: And that was the name of the investment firm?
Speaker 2: That was the investment firm.
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  Now is that after Hornblower and Weeks [Hornblower and Company, LLC] or before?
Speaker 2: That was first.
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  Oh, before Hornblower?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Could you spell the name of that firm?
Speaker 2: W-A-Y-N [sic.], Wayne Hummer, H-U-M-M-E-R.
Speaker 1: Thank you.  And what was your first duties or assignment when you went to work there?
Speaker 2: Well now you're going back in history (laughter).  My, my first assignment was as a broker, served as a broker as--to open up business opportunities for 'em, and after being there for about six months, they opened up a office for me in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois], which is the first time a minority had an investment office in Hyde Park, which I had for about five and a half years.
Speaker 1: Now how did you, what training did you go through?
Speaker 2: Self-training.  I was always interested in investments, I'd always done investing even when I was in the service and prior to going into service, and I guess it goes back to my grandfather and my parents' [Helen Taylor Dibble and Eugene H. Dibble, Jr.] upbringing that taught me to be interested in investing, and that was the first thing I wanted to do when I got out of the service and I got the opportunity to do so.
Speaker 1: What kind of investing were you doing prior to the time you came to Chicago?
Speaker 2: Well I was buying stocks and selling them even while I was in the service, and I was doing it on a very small scale, but I was trading.
Speaker 1: And when you opened up the office in Hyde Park, who were some of your first customers?
Speaker 2: Well, I had a multitude of customers from the Hyde Park area.  I can't think of the names right offhand, but I had a multitude of 'em--
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  John Johnson [HistoryMaker John H. Johnson].
Speaker 2: --because it was so convenient to--Johnnie Johnson was one of 'em.  It was so convenient being there in the area, a lot of people came in, both white and black.
Speaker 1: Now when you say Johnnie Johnson, were you talking about the Johnson of Johnson Products [Johnson Products Company] or Johnson Publishing [Johnson Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Johnson--Publishing.
Speaker 1: Johnson Publishing.
Speaker 2: Johnson Publishing.
Speaker 1: And how long were you an investor for Mr. Johnson?
Speaker 2: About seven years.
Story_ID: 627887
Speaker 1: Now at one point you were also a financial advisor to Elijah Muhammad?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: How did that relationship develop?
Speaker 2: Well, Elijah Muhammad called me and invited me over to his home one day, and we sat down and talked for quite a length of time, and he had a lot of things that he wanted to do and I agreed that I would help him.  One of the first things he wanted to do was to buy an airplane, and he hadn't been successful in buying airplanes, so I had some friends down in Nashville, Tennessee that had some planes, and I went down to Nashville and talked with them and was able to get a plane for him.  It was a plane that was set up for private individuals.  It was really a corporate jet, and I was able to get that for him and he bought it.  I think he paid about $7.5 million for it.  I know he did.  That's what he paid for it.  But he wanted to use it as he traveled around the country and for his associates to use and have an opportunity to be up to date in having a facility where they could go back and forth across the country.
Speaker 1: Did you help him get financing for that purchase?
Speaker 2: He didn't need financing; he financed it himself.
Speaker 1: Now you were also involved in the purchase of the mosque on Stony Island Avenue [Mosque Maryam, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: What was your involvement in that?
Speaker 2: Well, I arranged for the financing for it, and I arranged for him the purchase of it.
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  Did you select the site?
Speaker 2: The fight?
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  The site?
Speaker 2: Yes, the site was the property on Stony Island.
Speaker 1: So you arranged the purchase of that property?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I had a garage on Stony Island also, and it was a very large garage, and he came to me knowing that I had this facility and told me that he was looking for a facility on Stony Island, and I located it for him and arranged for the financing of it and for the acquisition of it.
Story_ID: 627888
Speaker 1: Was there a particular area of stock brokerage that you were involved in and certain types of stocks?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't specialize in any type of stocks, mostly listed stocks.
Speaker 1: So they were all on the New York Stock Exchange [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: All New York stocks, and American Stock Exchange [NYSE MKT] and over the counter; all three categories.
Speaker 1: When you opened your office on Hyde Park--in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois], were you there alone or did you have some employees?
Speaker 2: No, I brought in four employees.
Speaker 1: Now were you operating under your own name, or under the Hummer name?
Speaker 2: Wayne Hummer name [Wayne Hummer and Co.; Wintrust Wealth Management, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.  When you were at Hummer, did you have any mentors?
Speaker 2: Not per se, other than the fact that I first met these people on a social basis, and they actually came and solicited me to become involved.
Speaker 1: Okay, but did you have anybody within the Hummer organization that kind of showed you the ropes?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, most of the staff there and not only was with Wayne Hummer, I was also with Hornblower and Weeks [Hornblower and Company, LLC], which is another investment firm which I had interest in.
Speaker 1: And when did you go to Hornblower and Weeks?
Speaker 2: Probably three years after I was with Wayne Hummer associates.
Speaker 1: So were you representing Hummer at the same time?
Speaker 2: I was representing both of them, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you remember what year that was?
Speaker 2: That was in the early '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was it prior to ni- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Early '60s [1960s] up to '75 [1975].
Speaker 1: Okay, so maybe '63 [1963], '62 [1962]?
Speaker 2: Probably '62 [1962].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And in 1975, where did you go?
Speaker 2: I went and became--I went into my individual investments.
Speaker 1: And what was the name of your firm?
Speaker 2: E.H.D. and Sons [E.H.D. and Sons, Inc., Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: And what did that stand--E.H.D. and Sons?
Speaker 2: It's my name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where were your offices then?
Speaker 2: My office then was on Stony Island Avenue, and also I had an office downtown on LaSalle Street, but it didn't pay for me to have--maintain the office on LaSalle Street because I figured that I was isolated from the public and I went back to the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] and worked out of my garage offices.
Speaker 1: So your office was in the garage of your home?
Speaker 2: No, the garage that I had.  I had a very large garage there--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --on Stony Island--69th [Street] and Stony Island.
Speaker 1: So your--operated your investment firm out of that, that building?

Speaker 1: Now when your children were growing up, what kind of things did you try to get them involved in?  Did they travel?
Speaker 2: Well, they were exposed to travel, they traveled extensively.  We took them around, all over the place, and we tried to do that as much as we ca- could.  They've all been exposed to various types of lives from the point of poverty to success in the business world.  We never wanted to corrupt them to the extent that they thought that investments was the greatest thing in the world.  We felt that they should learn about hard times as well as the good times, and as a consequence they've come out and been very successful in their fields.
Speaker 1: Now when you say you took them from the point of poverty, what do you mean by that?
Speaker 2: If you have five kids, you got poverty.

Speaker 1: How many grandchildren do you have?
Speaker 2: Eight.
Story_ID: 627896
Speaker 1: Now what are some of your outside hobbies?
Speaker 2: Keeping up with them [Dibble, III's children and grandchildren].
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: They don't allow you time for hobbies.  They have their own agendas.
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  What's your main hobby that I always object to?
Speaker 2: Well, you object to everything, so that's nothing new.
Speaker 1: I had some information that you were into cars?
Speaker 2: I like cars, I love cars.  I have a number of cars which my wife [Jeannette Campbell Dibble] hates because she doesn't think I'm entitled to anything.  If I went to the golf course, she would complain about that, but that's life.
Speaker 1: Now what kind of cars are these?  Are these vintage cars?
Speaker 2: They're old cars, mostly old cars, yes.
Speaker 1: And how many of these do you have?
Speaker 2: About seven.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what types are they?
Speaker 2: Fords and Chevys [Chevrolet], Cadillacs.
Speaker 1: Any particular models and years?
Speaker 2: Well, they go all the way back to '50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: Okay, and what do you have that's in the '50s [1950s]?
Speaker 2: I have a Cadillac, which is in '51 [1951].
Speaker 1: What else?
Speaker 2: I have a Chevy, I have two Chevys, they're in the 2000 range, one's 1999, one's a 2001.  Then I have--
Speaker 1: What models are they?
Speaker 2: Most of them are four doors.
Speaker 1: No, what models?  Is it the Malibu [Chevrolet Malibu] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Four--Malibus, yeah.
Speaker 1: Both of them are Malibus?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what else?
Speaker 2: And I have a Ford two seater, it's a hardtop convertible.
Speaker 1: Is that a Mustang [Ford Mustang]?
Speaker 2: Mustang, yes.
Speaker 1: And what year is that?
Speaker 2: It's a '65 [1965].
Speaker 1: Okay, what else do you have?
Speaker 2: That's about all I got right now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My wife made me get rid of 'em.
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  Tell them about your Isetta.
Speaker 2: Oh, my Isetta is a car that you open from the front.  Have you seen that?
Speaker 1: No sir.
Speaker 2: You open it from the front, it only seats two people, it gets about fifty miles to a gallon.
Speaker 1: Now do you drive any of these now?
Speaker 2: Not too many, no.
Story_ID: 627897
Speaker 1: Now I understand, also understand that you like to cook.
Speaker 2: I cook when it's a necessity.
Speaker 1: Well, I heard that you are a gourmet chef.
Speaker 2: Well, I wouldn't go that far, but I'm good (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a particular favorite or specialty?
Speaker 2: I like to cook beefs, roasts and make up different dishes.
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  How about the rib business, you cook ribs for--
Speaker 2: Ribs.
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  --you did that when you had that Piggly Wiggly [ph.], didn't you?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: So you had a restaurant?
Speaker 2: No I don't have one now.
Speaker 1: No, you did at one time have a restaurant?
Speaker 2: I cooked in a restaurant, I didn't own it.
Speaker 1: Okay, and when was that?
Speaker 2: You know, I'd just go in and tell 'em I wanted to cook something, I mean it was all for personal, for friends, it wasn't anything I sold or anything.
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  Well what about the Piggly Wiggly business, honey?
Speaker 2: I had a restaurant, the Piggly Wiggly restaurant at one time.
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  Carry out.
Speaker 2: Carry out.
Speaker 1: And where was that?
Speaker 2: That was over on Stony Island Avenue [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: And what year was that--or years?
Speaker 2: What year was that?
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  Late '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: Late '60s [1960s], early '70s [1970s].  It was more of a hobby than anything else.
Story_ID: 627898
Speaker 1: I want to go back a little bit during the time that you were at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and living with your father [Eugene H. Dibble, Jr.].  During that time period, there was the Tuskegee study [Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male] that's gotten some attention.  Your father was involved in that?
Speaker 2: Well, to the extent that he knew about it.  He was the medical director of the hospital there, and he actually had two jobs.  He's medical director of the VA hospital [Tuskegee Veterans Administration Medical Center; Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System East Campus, Tuskegee, Alabama], and he was medical director of the hospital on the campus, the Tuskegee Institute hospital, and therefore we had to balance where we stayed.  Sometimes we'd stay at the veterans hospital, sometimes we'd stay on the campus, in our home on the campus.  His great thing was that every Sunday he'd go out in the country and treat patients who were impoverished and he had take us with him and, of course, my mother [Helen Taylor Dibble] would always have new suits for us and we'd go in the country and by the time we got through on that Sunday, the suits were out of style (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now were any of those patients that he was seeing, were any of those involved in the study itself?
Speaker 2: No, these patients weren't involved in the study themselves.  The patients that were involved in the study themselves came to the hospital, into the infantile paralysis unit and between the two units, that's where the patients were treated, and they had the exposure.  It was all under the John A. Andrew Hospital [John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital, Tuskegee, Alabama].
Speaker 1: Did your father talk about the study during that time period?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, he had because he was bringing in people.  You see every April, my father would bring in doctors from across the country and mostly minorities and he would have a two week clinic [of the John A. Andrew Clinical Society] in which they would participate and donate their time to.  A lot of people came from Chicago [Illinois], New York [New York], all over the country and this was his gift to the impoverished areas of Macon County [Alabama] and State of Alabama, but it was very interesting to the fact that although there was segregation in Alabama at that time, the hospital was always, always had white patients and they would come from all over the South to be treated at the hospital which my father was the medical director of.
Story_ID: 627899
Speaker 1: Now when they, when he had these clinics [of the John A. Andrew Clinical Society], were any of those clinics related to the syphilis study [Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, that was a big part of it.  The syphilis study was, as a matter of fact, one of the key people in the syphilis study was from, here in Chicago [Illinois], Dr. Drew, Charlie Drew.
Speaker 1: Charles Drew [Charles R. Drew]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What was his involvement in the study?
Speaker 2: He just had an interest in it, and he tried to help as many people as he could.
Speaker 1: Did he do (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But there were others that did that also.  Roscoe Giles [Roscoe Giles, Sr.], there were a lot of people from across the country, they came for that specific purpose.
Speaker 1: Now do you remember the nurse that was involved in the study?
Speaker 2: Which one?
Speaker 1: Eunice?
Speaker 2: Eunice, Eunice--I knew her, yeah, sure, I knew her very well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you remember her last name?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head) I'll think of it in a minute.
Speaker 1: Was it Rivers?
Speaker 2: Ms. Rivers [Eunice Rivers Laurie], yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and when did you first meet her?
Speaker 2: Oh, geez, when I was a little boy.  She was on the staff at John A. Andrew Hospital [John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital, Tuskegee, Alabama].
Speaker 1: All right.  And do you know what her involvement in the study was?
Speaker 2: Well she had a whole group of people that were involved that she brought in herself, and they would go out and visit patients throughout the county [Macon County, Alabama] and throughout the State of Alabama.
Speaker 1: You say she brought in a whole group of people, were these doctors or nurses or?
Speaker 2: Doctors, nurses, pharmacists, she had an array of people.  I knew her very well.
Speaker 1: Do you know when she died?
Speaker 2: I don't remember when, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What kind of things did your father [Eugene H. Dibble, Jr.] tell you about the study?  I mean, did you have discussions about it at home?
Speaker 2: Well, my father tried to limit his discussions when he came into the house, and many occasions, as I said, we were always with my father on Sunday when he went out to see patients and treat them for no fees or anything, impoverished people that couldn't come to the clinic, couldn't afford to come to the hospital.  We would always go with him on that as far as--
Speaker 1: That had nothing to do with the study itself did it?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, the study itself was involved in it to the extent because a lot of these people were used in the study.
Speaker 1: So some of these, these trips were to people who were involved in the study?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  He, he'd take out a staff of people who were involved in the study to meet with these people that we would go and spend time in--on Sundays with.  You see, he had, he had particular areas that he had go to, all right, on different Sunday.  I mean, he might go to Auburn [Alabama], Opelika [Alabama] area on a Sunday.  He might go to Union Springs [Alabama] area on another Sunday.  He might go to Montgomery [Alabama] area on another Sunday.  In other words, he would go where there were impoverished people and treat them for nothing.
Speaker 1: And some of those were--
Speaker 2: And he would take those people with him.  Sometime he had two or three vans of people he'd take with him.
Speaker 1: And these were doctors from the hospital and nurses?
Speaker 2: These were doctors, nurses, nurse practitioners; a whole variety of people.  And then there were people that would come around from the North, who would come to also see these patients and things.  So it was a multitude of things that were involved in the study.
Story_ID: 627900
Speaker 1: Do you remember the names of any of the white doctors that were involved in the study [Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male] that came from the [U.S.] Public Health Service?
Speaker 2: I knew a lot of them, right off hand, I couldn't give you the name but there were--Paul Dudley White was one.  He was a very prominent physician who came down all the time.
Speaker 1: Where did he come (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Walter Crump [Walter Gray Crump].
Speaker 1: Where did--
Speaker 2: Out of New York [New York].
Speaker 1: Where did Dr. White come from?
Speaker 2: I think he came from the Chicago [Illinois] area.  I'm not positive--
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  Or was it Cleveland [Ohio]?  Was it Cleveland?
Speaker 2: Or Cleveland [sic. Boston, Massachusetts], that's where he came from.
Speaker 1: And you mentioned a Dr. White.  Where was he from?
Speaker 2: From New York, Paul Dudley White.  Then there was Dr. Crump.  The list goes on and on.
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  What about the, the scientist that you went to work with at Michigan?
Speaker 2: Of University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan]?
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  Um-hm.  He was in blood, what, blood studies.  What does he do?
Speaker 2: He was in blood studies.
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  Was he Wass- Kahn, Dr. Kahn?
Speaker 2: Judge Reuben Kahn [Reuben Leon Kahn].
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  Of the Kahn-Wassermann test?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  Yeah.
Speaker 2: And was he involved in the study?
Speaker 1: Yeah, um-hm, Dr. Reuben Kahn.  As a matter of fact, I went to University of Michigan and worked for him a couple of summers.
Speaker 2: What year was that?
Speaker 1: Again, I don't remember what years they were.  They were in the '50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  Fifty-two [1952]?
Speaker 1: Fifty-two [1952], '53 [1953].
Speaker 2: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  Gene [HistoryMaker Eugene H. Dibble, III], was he involved in the syphilis study or in the clinic [of the John A. Andrew Clinical Society]?
Speaker 1: He was involved in both.
Speaker 2: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  Was he?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  He had three people that he would always bring down, three different people--
Speaker 2: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  Clinic.
Speaker 1: --to the clinic.  You'd be amazed, every year, they would have a clinic at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].
Speaker 2: Yeah, you mentioned that a little bit earlier.
Speaker 1: And they would have both white and blacks there from all over the country for this two year--two week period, which my father [Eugene H. Dibble, Jr.] would have, hold, and it wasn't originated by Dr.--what's his name?
Speaker 2: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  Dr. Forney is one, Dr. Claudius Forney from Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: He was there all the time.  No, I'm talking about the originator of this, what was his name?  I can't think of it at the minute.
Story_ID: 627901
Speaker 1: Now do you know whether your father [Eugene H. Dibble, Jr.] ever had any misgivings about the study [Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male]?
Speaker 2: He would have arguments every time he met somebody (laughter).
Speaker 1: In terms of meeting other doctors?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, they would argue all the time about it.
Speaker 1: What was his, his kind of position on the study?
Speaker 2: Well, he thought the stu- subjects--I mean, study should be continued and expanded.  He brought a lot of people down from Georgia Tech [Georgia School of Technology; Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia], he brought a lot of people down from the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan].  He brought doctors from all over for the specific purpose of discuss--of evaluating their studies.
Speaker 1: But he was, he was a strong supporter of the studies?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  As a matter of fact, he was criticized many times for having so many studies going at one time.
Speaker 1: Was your father still alive when the studies were ended?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Was he involved (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know the studies just ended, what, in the late '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: Right.  Was he involved in it up until the time that he either retired?
Speaker 2: He didn't retire, he just dropped dead.
Speaker 1: Was he still involved in the studies at that time?
Speaker 2: Not as much as he was devoted to other things.  He was devoted mostly to the development of the hospital [John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital, Tuskegee, Alabama] and the integration of the hospital to the extent that they brought in the infantile paralysis center, and expanded that and built a new building for it and, I mean, he had so many things going at one time that he couldn't devote his time to any particular subject.
Speaker 1: Now you mentioned that your father often had arguments about the study.  Who did he have those arguments with, do you recall?
Speaker 2: Various doctors across the country.
Speaker 1: Anyone in particular?
Speaker 2: Dr. Roscoe Giles [Roscoe Giles, Sr.].  He used to fuss with him all the time.
Speaker 1: And Dr. Giles was opposed to the study?
Speaker 2: He wasn't opposed, but he had limited knowledge of the studies, in my opinion.
Speaker 1: Now there were some in the record, there were some discussion about in 1945 when penicillin became available that the study continue on the untreated patients.  Did your father ever talk about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They stopped it for a while.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you remember--
Speaker 2: They stopped it.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what year that was?
Speaker 2: Forty-five [1945] to '49 [1949].
Speaker 1: And was there a particular reason they stopped it?
Speaker 2: I don't know the reason.
Speaker 1: And why was it started back up?
Speaker 2: Because they thought it would still merit, deserve further study and he would, I guess, condescend to other doctors who would come there for various meetings and things across the country that were interested in continuing the study of it.
Speaker 1: Did your father ever explain to you what the study was about?
Speaker 2: He explained it to me, but it went in one ear and out the other.  You know, I was a youngster at that time, I--(laughter).  I need some water.
Speaker 1: Now you said your father received some criticism for the study.  Do you know where that came from?
Speaker 2: People who were adverse to the study completely.
Speaker 1: Were there any public agencies that were adverse to the study?
Speaker 2: No, it was mostly individuals.  Oh, yeah, the city of Macon--County of Cook was adverse to it at a while, for a while.
Speaker 1: Was it the County of Cook or Macon County [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Macon County.  What did I say, Cook?  I'm sorry, Macon County, but he overcame that.
Speaker 1: And who, who at the county, Macon County, was opposed?  Was it the public health official or--
Speaker 2: Public health official.  He was a guy who was always resentful of the doctors at Tuskegee Institute [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and the doctors at the VA hospital [Tuskegee Veterans Administration Medical Center; Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System East Campus, Tuskegee, Alabama], and he was a white fellow, they were all minorities and he was always resentful until they finally had to get rid of him completely because he created such turmoil.
Speaker 1: Do you remember his name?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: And was he a doctor?
Speaker 2: He was a doctor.
Story_ID: 627902
Speaker 1: Do you still invest fairly heavily?
Speaker 2: Do I still invest?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well, I don't have the resources to invest.  When you have five children and grandchildren, you invest in education.
Speaker 1: Well, all your children are grown now.
Speaker 2: Oh, I got the grandchildren now.  (Laughter) They increase in numbers.  We do what we can.  We've been very successful.  We've been able to educate all our kids.  We're now helping to educate our grandchildren and we're making the sacrifices that is necessary to do it and maybe we ought to have them out doing it on their own and getting a job, but we just feel that we take them to that point and then put them on their own.
Story_ID: 627903
Speaker 1: What advice would you give a young person today who wanted to get into the stock brokerage business?
Speaker 2: Well, I would say this to them.  There's a lot of opportunities in making money in the stock market business, but there's also a lot of opportunity in losing a lot of money as you're witnessing today.  The stock market is in the dr- really deep end right now.  My opinion is that, very interesting that you ask that question because I just had a two and a half hour meeting about it and I would tell anybody today that's interested in investing if they can wait long enough now is the time to buy stocks.  Surely it might take, get a continued tip--dip for a while but it's always going to come back.
Speaker 1: Are there any particular areas of the market that you feel that are stronger than or would be the best investment these days?
Speaker 2: Well, I think in the electronic, in the electronics field with so many new products coming out today that there's opportunities there.  I think the opportunities just in investing and creating funds or giving funds to these companies that are interested in investing in 'em to the extent that--anything's a gamble but if you pick the right stocks and the right management and the right team and the potential of the corporation that they're investing in then you've got a chance, but you've got to be very careful of what corporations you invest in today.
Story_ID: 627904
Speaker 1: What kind of research do you do before you recommend an investment in a particular company?
Speaker 2: Well see I do differently than most people do. I read the newspapers and I read a multitude of newspapers and from those newspapers you're able to get a fix on what's going on every day in this society.  I mean a lot of people want to go back and research the records and do everything else but that's not going to prove anything.  You've got to be current on what's going on every day and interpret that as to how you, what you're going to do on your investments for the future.  This is a very critical time in our lives and as I was telling somebody yesterday, I said, we are six months to a year before this market's going to turn around.
Speaker 1: What kind of things do you look for in those newspapers that give you some insight as to where you want to invest?
Speaker 2: Who's investing what and what companies they're investing it in and what the potential of the company is and what is the longevity of the company and what's the history of the company and what's the prospects for the future.  It's just like people that are going out buying new watches today because they think there's going to be a revolution in the market for watches.  They think there's going to be a completely different type of watch in the market in the next three to five years.  I mean, that's just an example.  I don't seem to agree with it because there's not much more you can do with watches, I think, in my opinion.  But there are other situations where--I mean, a good example is automobile.  You're now getting cars that you can buy where you get forty to fifty gallons--I mean, forty to fifty miles to a gallon.  Two years ago that was unheard of.
Story_ID: 627905
Speaker 1: Now we were talking about how you go about looking at opportunities in terms of investments, and you say you read the papers and look at who's investing and what industries are, you know, are highlighted.  When you talk about who's investing, who are you looking at?
Speaker 2: Well, I do one of--different things.  Every day I go out and meet with people and listen to their ideas, especially in the evening.  You would be amazed through general conversation of the things that come out, what people are interested in or what people are doing and the reason why they're doing it and the reason why they're not doing it.  And this is what you've got to do is to, in addition to reading about a company, you've got to know who their empl- people are involved in or who the investors are, why they invested in it and what the potential of the company is and that's how you make your money.
Speaker 1: Now when you say you go out and talk to people, are you talking to businesspeople or--
Speaker 2: I talk to businesspeople.
Story_ID: 627906
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  And also, Gene [HistoryMaker Eugene H. Dibble, III], you are a strong advocate of talking to the man on the street.
Speaker 2: Oh, I talk to the people on the street all the time.  I stop and talk to people who I might see is in trouble.  I mean, I help them out, I give them rides, I do everything.  But you can always learn something from those people.
Speaker 1: And what kind of things do you learn from them?
Speaker 2: You know, you'd be amazed at the amount of information you can get from some of these impoverished people.
Speaker 1: Can you give us an example?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the other day there was a woman who was over, living over in the projects and she was telling me about all the problems that she was having over there and how the difficulties were and how nothing was safe and she couldn't leave her pocketbook around and couldn't do anything.  So I went back and talked to the mayor and told him.
Speaker 1: Mayor Daley [Richard M. Daley]?
Speaker 2: Mayor Daley, and I talked to Daley's assistant, really, and I told him what was going on, and I said, "How do you expect people to live over in this project, in these times and conditions and they have no security, no nothing, they are afraid to come out of their houses at night and things."  And as a consequence of that, he has done a tremendous job in putting additional security on the street.  Now he's talking about bringing in both the state [Illinois State Police] and the National Guard.
Speaker 1: Now that was the governor [Rod Blagojevich] that first mentioned that.
Speaker 2: No, this was the mayor that first mentioned it, then the governor picked it up.  You see, the governor you don't see out here.  You might see him occasionally.  If he got out in the streets and saw what was going on, he might be a better governor.
Speaker 1: Now what kind of investment insight would you get from talking to a person like this?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, you'd be amazed at talking to people what can help them and the companies that can help them and why--where they've purchased their items from and things of that nature.  That tells a lot about a person.  I mean, look at all the people that go downtown and pass up these stores to buy products.  They must do that for a reason, and I think that the problem of today is that you can eliminate all this crime that you got, you got more crime on the streets today than we've ever had here in Chicago [Illinois].  If Daley would follow what the governor said, well Daley's fighting it.  He's fighting bringing in the National Guard and these, these other soldiers to protect the communities.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I understand that part of what you're saying, but you, you're kind of alluding to the fact that you can garnish some idea of what types of businesses or investments you might make by talking with the man on the street, so to speak.
Speaker 2: That's right, but what his interest is and what he would like to have and what the potential there is if he ever got some money to buy something, and what he want to do with the money.
Speaker 1: So you're looking at their potential spending patterns?
Speaker 2: Looking at potential spending patterns, what products could be beneficial to them as the reason why they would want to buy this.
Speaker 1: So then you would look at the companies that manufacture those products?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: And that's where you would direct some of your investments?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Story_ID: 627907
Speaker 1: I just wanted to follow up on something you said during the last interview.  You mentioned that--we were talking about, you know, who's out there now and you mentioned aggressive, young black females.  Do you recall that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Who were some of those in the Chicago [Illinois] area that you think that fit into that category?
Speaker 2: Of the females?
Speaker 1: Yes sir.
Speaker 2: Well I'll tell you something.  The females are taking over the city.  Females are getting more positions today than males are getting and if somebody doesn't rise to the occasion, the male--the black males are going to be left out.
Speaker 1: Are there particular females that you've seen that you think are doing a very good job (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I can take you across the street and show you ten black women who have key jobs which they've gotten in the last two to four years in this city, and prior to that they were in the secretarial level.
Speaker 1: But in terms of say the financial industry, stock brokerage and banking, are there particular individuals you think, particularly in the black community, that stand out to you?
Speaker 2: Black individuals?
Speaker 1: Yes sir.
Speaker 2: Who stand out in the financial community?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I think I know several who are doing very well in investing their money and who are going into the arena, but I can only say that on what I'm seeing on the surface, I don't know the foundation of the whole thing at this point.  But I can say that there are some aggressive people who are out here trying to get ahead and they are trying to get--penetrate the white communities to get ahead.
Speaker 1: Are there any particular individuals that you know or you've had some involvement with?
Speaker 2: Not that I've had any involvement with, but which I watched and seen.
Speaker 1: And do you know the names of any of those individuals that kind of stand out to you?
Speaker 2: I know most of 'em by first names (laughter), I just don't know the last names.  But there's a girl over here, Margaret Rehn [ph.], I think, is her name who has been very successful in her last three years.
Speaker 1: What kind of business--
Speaker 2: Barbara Jones [ph.] over there who has been very successful in the last three years.
Speaker 1: What was her name again?
Speaker 2: Barbara Jones.
Speaker 1: Do you know what kind of business she's in?
Speaker 2: Well, she's dead now, but--she, she just died.  She was on her way down south and died on the airplane but she had built up a tremendous business.
Speaker 1: And what type of business was it?
Speaker 2: She was buying up real estate and establishing stores and things out here on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: And you mentioned a Margaret.  Do you know what type of business she was in?
Speaker 2: Margaret is buying up electrical appliances and reselling them.
Speaker 1: Anyone else you can think of?  Male or female?
Speaker 2: I can get you some names.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's fine.
Speaker 2: You know I don't pay- (laughter) I talk and I meet somebody to talk to, I mean, keep going.

Speaker 1: Just to wrap up, what are your thoughts about the future?
Speaker 2: I wish I was a young man, I'd be out here taking advantage of it, but I think the future is unlimited, and the reason why I say that, I think integration is opening up wider and wider every day.  And I was just--it's very interesting, I go down to the restaurant mostly every week to have lunch and today there were three black women in there.  Now this is the first time I've ever seen that, Gene and Georgetti's [Gene and Georgetti, Chicago, Illinois].  As popular as that restaurant is, that's the first time I've ever seen one black in there, other than Jim Compton [HistoryMaker James W. Compton] and myself, and it's tragic.  And I say to them, I say, all of the businessmen that are there and come over and speak to you and greet you and there's them, because you know, we've been going there so long, but I say, this is what our people need the exposure of, of meeting these people and going to find out about their companies and taking advantage of 'em.  I mean, I'm too old to do that, I don't want to look and see what they're doing anymore, but these are very successful and very prominent men on the, in the Loop [Chicago, Illinois], from across the city, they come there.
Speaker 1: So you feel it's a good networking opportunity?
Speaker 2: It's excellent network opportunities and I think this is what we've got to get the exposure of.
Speaker 1: Have you ever had, have you ever been a mentor to anybody in particular during your years in the--
Speaker 2: I've helped plenty people, plenty people.  I got two of them now, one I've had for, what forty years, one, thirty-seven years, Vaughn and Herman.
Speaker 1: What are their last names?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: What are their last names?
Speaker 2: Herman Lowe [ph.] and Vaughn Chandler [ph.] but--
Speaker 1: (JEANETTE CAMPBELL DIBBLE):  But Gene [HistoryMaker Eugene H. Dibble, III], he's talking about mentoring in the financial business.  Vaughn and Herman--
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, but, I know what he's talking about, but still they are from impoverished areas but they now have developed where they know how to go downtown, they know what to buy, they know about real estate now, they're interested in buying some real estate now, they're interested in developing themselves, but look how long it's taken them to do that.
Story_ID: 627909
Speaker 1: Are there any areas that we haven't covered that you would like to talk about, particularly in terms of your, your business background and your business over the years?
Speaker 2: I will say this: that the opportunities today are limited for minorities but they've got to get in and mingle.  They can't be home at night.  They've got to be out socializing and meeting with people.  They've got to be out during the day.  I go out just about every night to get the newspapers, but also I stop in the bar and there are multitude of people in there who I've gotten to know and who discuss all types of business, every night. If something happens today, the whole conversation is on what should be done about it and this is what has got to happen.  There's got to be more exposure and more taking advantage of and that's the only way you can get ahead.  These, it's just, I mean, you look at all of 'em.  You've seen 'em.  These guys are millionaires but they will talk and tell you what's going on, what's happening, what they're doing and the opportunities that are available and this is the important thing, that we as a race have got to integrate and socialize.
Speaker 1: Okay, well thank you very much, Mr. Dibble [HistoryMaker Eugene H. Dibble, III], on behalf of The HistoryMakers, we really enjoyed our conversation with you and we're going to wrap this up.  Again, thank you.
Speaker 2: Well, all I can say is it's been a hard struggle, I got no regrets and we enjoy life at our old age and all you can do is continue to do that from the--here on but for a young man like you, I'll tell you, the opportunity's unlimited and I tell the young people this all the time, don't I?  You know I tell 'em.  I tell both women and men that you can't be sitting out here on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] expect to find out what's going on downtown.  You got to know what Daley's [Richard M. Daley] saying about by midnight just like all the white people know so you're prepared to do what he's going to address and that's just the way it is.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well again, thank you very much.
