Speaker 1: Okay, what were the names of your parents?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Carrie, C-A-R-R-I-E, Carrie, maiden name was Stone, and my father was Thomas.  And matter of fact he was a Jr.  We didn't find out he was a Jr. until later on in life and my brother had been named Jr., you know, so he got really technically with two juniors, but anyway Thomas.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.
Speaker 2: Strange.
Speaker 1: Now what is the--can you give us the names of your brothers or, or sisters.  I don't know if you have any brothers or sisters.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Anyway you have a brother we know that, in, in the order of their birth.
Speaker 2: In the order of their birth, I have a sister named Cassandra.  Want me to spell that?  C-A-S-S-A-N-D-R-A, Cassandra and she's the oldest and my brother Tommy or Thomas, Jr., is second, I was third, and I had a sister who is deceased and her name was Frechettia, F-R-E-C-H-E-T-T-I-A.  My mother had a thing about, about these names, you know, and so she really, really picked 'em very, very closely.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you are?
Speaker 2: I'm, I'm the third in line.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay third person, third child.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, and is, is there any particular sig significance to, significance to the name Ausbra?
Speaker 2: My mother I, I asked her and everything she said that the name it comes from the Indians of South America, and it, it's, she said it means the seeker or the searcher, someone who is searching and seeking.  When she went to school at Coleman, you know, and talked about integration there and you know they had all the immigrants coming in 47th Street was, that was the entrance to everything.  All the immigrants came in.  One we had the Germans, the Irish, the Jews, everybody came in there and so she, this young lady was immigrant from South America and she was a good friend of my mother's and she got the name from her and so she said when, she said with this particular child I know who the name and everything else and so she gave me that name, you know.  But, I've never in all the places I've been I've never heard that name before.
Story_ID: 67146
Speaker 1: Okay. Now Professor Ford now you were born here in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, um-hum on 47th Street, forty, I remember 47th and Wabash in the heart of the ghetto, and 47th Street was the main street, you know, so it was so much different than it is now and everything else, so it was, I mean, poor, poor.  And we lived I a big huge building, you know, one of those big five-story block long buildings that had any and everybody in it and everything.  It was an interesting, interesting, interesting childhood I tell you that, so that 47th Street was it, you know.
Story_ID: 67147
Speaker 1: Okay, now where were your parents [Carrie Stone Ford and Thomas Ford, Jr.] from?  Can, can you tell me something about your ancestry in general, not just your parents, but do you know anything about your grandparents, great grandparents?
Speaker 2: The only thing I can think see 'cause I don't know that much about my father's side except for little tidbits and everything else that he would drop out and everything that he would, you know, drop to us and everything else every now and then.  And, and I know very little about his side of the family except that awful lot-- the blood is heavy on the Indian side because his sisters look like they're directly off--he had si, six sisters, and he was the only boy, and they look like they're directly off the reservation.  I mean, long hair, I mean, the whole Indian bit and everything.
Speaker 1: Where were they from--(unclear)--?
Speaker 2: Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Un-hum.
Speaker 1: What part do you know?
Speaker 2: I'm not for certain 'cause he wouldn't tell all that stuff, you know, and because he would, he, he ran away from home at an early age and everything else 'cause he never got along with his, with his stepfather and so he ran away and raised himself.  He was a, when I say an absolute fascinating, fascinating, fascinating, character; that was my father.
Story_ID: 67148
Speaker 1: Well, what did you--give us some more information on what made him [Ford's father, Thomas Ford, Jr.] so fascinating to you?
Speaker 2: What's so fascinating is that he had done everything as if he had been everywhere.  He was really, I always called him he was my tutor in a sense, and because he was in the trucking business and I would go with him on the truck and we would go out of town and everything and he had his own business and you know with his ferocious black men that, you know, believe in black enterprise and everything else and that was his, that was his thing.  So, when I would be with him on the truck it was like he would teach.  In other words, he, he had read, it seemed like he had read everything and yet he had almost self-educated.  He went to the sixth grade, I believe.  And you wonder and say how can this man be so, you know, so glib, so, I mean, he, I wasn't too much didn't know especially history.  I mean, the man was in depth and he wasn't, you know, he didn't throw it at you and everything else, but everybody who met him was all, they were always, always, fascinated and impressed by him.  There was no if, ands, or buts about him, you know, so that part and so there wasn't anything that he couldn't do.  He was smart in business.  He, he was smart with the books.  He always said I got my books, you know.  I've, I've, I've lost my books when we moved and everything else.  But, it was obvious that he was a very, very read man.  Always read two or three papers a day, always.  "Read between the lines" was his phrase, you know, and so he was fascinating.  On so many levels, he was the kind of person that you wanted to be around and that you wanted to, to, you know, just learn from and be in his company all the time.  You know, he was--he knew how to take care of himself physically.  He would fight.  I mean, he could have been a professional prize fighter he was that good.  Nobody, absolutely nobody fooled with my father, and he was that good of a fighter.  So, he had a sharp temper, but he was a nice person; don't cross him.  And so you, you got all these things playing and so he became, he really became my hero in that so much of what I know and my influence came from him.  You know like for instance now I got into field in terms of studying about funeral art and of course you dealing in the South and everything else and he could tell you story, after story, after story, after story about the South and, and everything and so I had learned so much and I'd gotten so much in school and everything else when the '60's [1960s] came along and people were talking about, you know, you know, the, the black movement and everything else and about history and everything, but I knew all that stuff because my dad had, you know, he had taught us, we had discussions at the dinner table and it was always, you know, you had to know your stuff.  And when we went to school you got it in school, so I was raised up that way, so I'm just a product of he, you know, he and my mother, I mean, definitely always said that this man really was my tutor in life.  It wasn't anything from religious aspects, you know, to the Bible to anything, this man co, could talk about it.  He was, he was so good.  For instance, he was, of course black people weren't into chess as much, but he was a checker player and people would come from all over the city to play him at checkers.  So, he would play about ten, almost five people at one time.  Mass of people.  He'd just go there, you know, boom, boom, boom, go to the next guy boom, boom, boom.
Speaker 1: Where did they play?  Where were they playing?
Speaker 2: At the house.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so all the guys that thought they were good would come and take my father on and so he'd take on five or six guys at one time, you know.  He was that kind of person that we always were just fascinated, you, you wondered "what is it that he doesn't know," so this is kind of what influenced me and everything else and so that's what made him so fascinating.  I'm, I'm sorry I'm running on.
Speaker 1: No, no, that's all right, but-
Story_ID: 67149
Speaker 1: What kind of business did he [Ford's father, Thomas Ford, Jr.]--
Speaker 2: My father interesting, my father was in, it was the broken glass business.  What they recycle now, it's recycling glass.  And he would go to the factories and he buy, you know, get it from the factories and like, you know, Coca Cola, Pepsi, you know, of course it was in glass back in those days and everything else.  And he would get it by the ton.  So, my father had his own trucks and everything, so I sat at his knee and learned business.  I mean, I call it "Business 101;" he was that good.  He was extremely sharp business man.  And so he had his own trucks and so that made him kind of stand out in the neighborhood and everything else.  And so it was an unusual business where as he had, you know a pretty, a good oppor, he made good money.
Speaker 1: How many trucks did he, did he have?
Speaker 2: He had two trucks, big trucks, you know, we call six wheelers, you know, big dump trucks.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so he was, you know, it wasn't any Mickey Mouse stuff he was big time.  And so we would go to various states, Indiana, Wisconsin, go to the big factories and pick up glass and everything by the ton, you know, truck hold, held about ten ton.
Story_ID: 67150
Speaker 1: So, he, he [Ford's father, Thomas Ford, Jr.] was from Mississippi but he didn't really talking about where he was from?
Speaker 2: No every--
Speaker 1: Did he talk about his parents at all?
Speaker 2: A little bit.  I just knew every once in a while he would say something about his mother and everything else and a little something about his sisters and basically that was all.  We knew two of his sisters.  Those were the only two that would come to see us now and then.  One sister lived not too far from us, and another sister would come up every now and then from Mississippi and visit.  Every once in a while his cousins would come up, but it was no continuous link and we were real tight or real close or anything else because he literally raised himself.  So, he ran away from home and he travelled around and, you know, had all kind of jobs and everything else.  This man was a, I said fascinating, that's not the word for him, you know, so he raised himself, taught him, you know--
Speaker 1: What age did he leave Mississippi?
Speaker 2: I guess he must have been somewhere around 10 or 12 at most, 10 or 12 something like that.  He just, he said he just couldn't take this guy and he didn't want this man to fall out with his mother and everything else.  And I don't know if the guy was slightly abusive to him or something like that, but my father said I wanted to leave before I killed him.
Speaker 1: Did he talk about how he left?  How did he leave?
Speaker 2: He just said he just one day just said, told his mother that you know hey well there's no room here for me and I don't wanna, you know, be in the house with this guy and everything else.  So, obviously he was, he was statuesque, he was muscles and all this other kind of stuff and everything else and he was the kind of person that when he told you he was gonna do something he did; you didn't have to worry about that he would do it.  And if he told you he was gonna be violent towards you he was gonna be violent towards you and usually he would be on the winning side.  He was that kind of person, so he just told her he said, "Well I just have to leave" and that's it and so he just left and so, but he gives us journeys of how he went through the South and ah I mean, but this man was fascinating.
Story_ID: 67151
Speaker 1: You know, you learn about the log.  For instance, let me, let me tell one.  One time he [Ford's father, Thomas Ford, Jr.] said that when he had run away from home that they used to have logging camps and, and you know you could kind of sign up and the pay was supposed to be good and everything else and so he said he was kind of big for his age and everything else and said that he went to this place and he signed up and all this other kind of stuff.  He said and "It turned out to be," he said, "Man this was slavery."  He said, "They had these guys you could not leave.  Once you got in, you could not leave.  They carried you out of there, you know, feet first when you left" and you know you kind of said, "You sure, dad that that kind of stuff existed" and all this other kind of stuff.  So, he said that the guys kind of liked him and everything else and they told him and said, "Man don't stay.  Once you get an opportunity we gonna kind of help you, you know leave."  He said, "If you don't leave and they catch up with you and all this other kind of stuff and everything they will kill you.  They do it all the time."  And, you know, stories like this and so he escaped.  They finally helped him to escape and then he gives us a journey of going through, you know, going through, you know, this area and everything else, you know with practically nothing, you know, and so all of these stories are interesting.  Then, we go into the, to the ghost stuff, to a house that was, was haunted and all this other stuff.  He--(unclear)--when you came, when you came and the old man started to talk man it was, you know, you just sat down and pull up a chair, man 'cause it's, it's learning time.  That's the only thing that you could stay about.  So, those kind of stories and first I said, I said "No this stuff didn't, you know, the old man was kind of putting it on.  You know, people sit around and fib."  Hey, I started doing research, I got my degree and every other thing.  I'm doing research over at Northwestern [University in Evanston, Illinois] and you read these books and everything and there it comes.  Say all this stuff was true that they did have things like this happening and then of course you get into the spiritual side and now we into in which I disagree with all the stuff that's being pushed out on people general, in general and black folks in particular the whole, the whole thing in terms of spirits and everything.  We get the wrong end of it.  We get--and--but any rate he was talking about how houses could be possessed.  He said for instance he said he was, he said, "Man I didn't have--I was almost frozen."  He said, "I didn't have any place to go and everything."  He said, "I was starving."  He said, "My feet were swelling and everything else."  He said, "I tied rags around my feet.  I didn't have any shoes worth I don't know he came into this house and the house looked like the people food was on the table, knives and forks and every other thing and all this other kind of jazz like the people had left immediately just like that, you know."  He said, "Nobody came."  He said, "I sat and waited nobody came."  He said look, he said, "I was about the freeze to death" he said, "so I went in there."  He said he ate some of the food.  He said, "I got under the mattress."  He said, "Then that's when the stuff started at night, you know, stuff moving and rattling and the bed jumping up and down and all this other kind of stuff."  I said, "Dang dad," you know, so this was--he was famous for this.  And you know when you start to get into research and you read, you know, the, all history of black people and then you find out this is, this is, this becomes it falls into what black people had talked about and everything else.  The old man wasn't crazy, you know.  He was very sane.  He said, "Look I was not gonna leave that place."  He said they, the bed up and down.  He said like somebody was there shaking it, turning it, and all this other kind of stuff.  You could hear the dishes like somebody crazy in the house.  He said, "But I wasn't," he said "I was not gonna leave, get from under that mattress."  He said, "I was that cold, I was that desperate and everything else."  He said, "and I woke up in the morning," he said, "and everything seem to be in place."  He said, he said "I got out of there as fast as I could."  He said, but these are the kind of things that, the kind of stories and he could switch from that to the treatment of black people in the South.  The old man knew how to, you know, use, know how to make alcohol.  You know he had got with friends.  I mean, he was a fascinating person.  And so all of these stories and when you start to read history you know the old man was dead on and he was not lying.  So, this helps formulate, it gives you an idea and everything else and I just became, you know, you know--and he was always up on current events, always.  You know (laughter) he was so, he was just fascinating, you know.
Speaker 2: So he's fun-- he's the kind of person it would be fun to sit on the porch with--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Oh man, that was it.  That was, that was the ultimate you know.
Speaker 2: More entertainment than the television.
Speaker 1: Oh, yep, I mean and sure enough, I mean, I mean not silly stuff or stuff like that.  Like I told you before you know Marcus Garvey was his man.  I knew Mar, about Marcus Garvey when I was, you know (laughter).
Story_ID: 67152
Speaker 1: Now was your father [Thomas Ford, Jr.] a member of the Universal Negro Improvement Association?
Speaker 2: I believe he was.  He never did say.  I believe he marched with them up in New York [New York City, New York] and everything, so he'd always been, always had told us and everything he said look he said--he always had that mind it was never--his mind was never like this, it was always spreading, he'd travel.
Speaker 1: He lived in other cities other than Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yeah because he was, you know, Pullman porter, so he got around to these different cities and everything else and you know and--
Speaker 1: He was a porter before he started his business?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was a porter, so he did all kind of, and he was a cook.  He had his own restaurant and every other (laughter)--I tell you when I say fascinating he was a great cook, great cook.  He had his own restaurant, so he always had--look he was very philosophical and he was very, very right in terms of he always was for black business and everything else and he always he had a saying down front and everything else.  I said look "I am very smart, I am very intelligent."  He said, "and that the reason I came up North."  He said, "Down South is the different is he said whites will keep you down, keeping, they'll keep themselves down keeping you down.  When you come up here, you know hey, you on your own.  You can do what you want to do."  He said, "I believe in free enterprise" he said, "and I am not going to starve, my family is not going to starve. One way or the other I will always feed them."  We never ever missed a meal.  We always dressed very well and also he was man of his word and everything and as he always said, he said, "Hey if, it's up to you."  He said, "If black people would organize and have businesses and do what they have to do we would not be in this situation.  Most of it is our fault," he said, "because you can't blame white folk for the situation that we're in."  Those were, those were his words.  He said you, you can get out of that ditch if you wanna, you know, he said it's up to you.  So, he would always, he always had a hustle, and I've only known him to work for somebody else only one time in my lifetime that I remember and that's when the business down and he had to get a job.  Other than that, he always was self-employed.
Speaker 1: Sounds fascinating.
Speaker 2: Ooh (laughter), so I--you hear Marcus Garvey.  He'd talk about what Marcus Garvey was about, you know, and he was the kind of person where he had that kind of sharp mind, not just give you stories and he give you both sides of it and everything else and sometimes we'd sit at the dinner table and everything else you had, you had to have a sharp mind.  You know, what side of the argument you wanna be on pro, con, or whatever you'd go at it, you know, and so it was always a fascinating give and take with the family and everything, you know, so it was as I said before and my mother [Carrie Stone Ford] was as sharp as he was and she had to be 'cause he was so dynamic and not domineering or dominant 'cause he was a nice, kind man, but you know that's a strong force and she was equally as strong as he was.  So, they really, really influenced, you know, me very, very strongly.
Story_ID: 67153
Speaker 1: Now, where was your mother [Carrie Stone Ford] from?  Was she from--
Speaker 2: My mother, my mother, my mother was from Wadley, Georgia, and which is fascinating.  And her background and everything else was fascinating.  As I said get, get back to history and everything else.  My mother always said, you know, the, that the way they came up from Wadley, Georgia, was, you know, people said well you know you were--go ahead.
Speaker 1: Can you spell it?  I just wanted--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Wadley, W-A-D-L-E-Y, I think it is or L-Y, one or the two, Wadley, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Is it near any, is it near any place that we--
Speaker 2: It's in from the [Atlantic] Coast.  You know it it's kind of inland to a certain extent.  A little small, small town, small town and interesting where as they had to literally almost escape from the South.  And she and my father [Thomas Ford, Jr.] always had interesting stories to say, you know, because she said that she was the oldest child and there was six of them.  She was the oldest child and you know you always work and you never go ahead and every other thing, and so my grandfather decided, you know, hey, just had to, you know, had to move North and all this other, but you couldn't leave.  They had such a grip on you, you know, and you try and tell young people today, you know, that it's not as easy to just walk off and leave.  People say well you owe us and you owe, so you tied to--(unclear)--you really is, you almost like a slave and so she said literally how they left Wadley was he left and so she said being the oldest child she was given instructions, you know, when whites come around and you were not to tell anything about your father except that he abandoned the family.  And that's what she told 'cause whites would come around and always try, you know, try and get the information out of the kids.  And so, this is how you get this thing in terms of the discipline of black children.  You know if you let that out and man somebody's gonna die, that's all there is to it and so, and they had the school the other kids all the way down that you never told what happened.  And so what he would do you couldn't send money directly to the family.  He had to send money to a cousin who lived in another town and they slightly got some money to her to kinda hang on, but she had to work in the fields and everything.  And so how they got out of, how they left Wadley was this cousin after he'd sent enough money this cousin went to another town, bought tickets to go to Chicago [Illinois] and everything else.  They had to go to another, leave at the dead of night, go to another town and catch the train at night and they had the tickets and everything.  Somebody got the tickets to them and all that.  That's how she said literally she said was escaping, and there was no other way you could have gotten out of there, no other way.  Said somebody would have died, somebody, you know, it would have been some kind of tragedy and everything else.  So, she said that's literally how they escaped Georgia.  So, we came up North and everything else.  So, her background is, you know, interesting, but the old man was he was, he was up there.  But, she was a very, very fascinating, fascinating, fascinating, fascinating mother.
Story_ID: 67154
Speaker 1: My--I always tell the students and everything else that the women in, in the family are always extremely, extremely strong, organizing and everything else, and that's my mother's [Carrie Stone Ford] side, you know, same was the old man [Thomas Ford, Jr.] 'cause he could, you know, go at something and do it and everything else.  He didn't fool around.  And she was the kind of same way and so she was a very, very great organizer.  She organized that household.  She ran it.  You know took care of us.  Everything was, she was a very, very orderly person, very, very clean, very, very orderly, and she was very, very strong and every, outside of being very, very loving.  So, you got those two forces and she was an--she was, she on the side doing the--she always said in the South that she learned how to do quilting.  'Cause you know down time during the fields and everything that's when quilting was done.  So, she was a master quilter.  So, you know, in other words when you wore out the shirt and every other thing, you know, you didn't throw it away, you know, next thing you know you see that shirt in the quilt, you know, so that whole thing of black, you know, recycling and everything else.  And so, she was a master of that.  You know, so she was one of those kind of people that you know you just watch and learn and she was loving and caring and could organize a bunch of women any place, any time.  I mean, she was just, she was his equal all the time and so she was such a strong force, and her mother [Bessie Stone] was a strong force in the church, outside of the church and everything else.  Organizer, don't stand for any stuff, you know, you know my rights are my rights and every other thing.  Don't back down off anybody if you're right.  So, she was that kind of person.  So, I had those strong forces in my life, you know.  So, she was very into--so outside of being with the quilts and everything else she went to school.  She had graduated from high school, which I rare during those days, you know--(unclear)--you dropped out of school and went to work to help your family.
Speaker 2: Did she graduate in George or, or Chicago?
Speaker 1: Here.  She went here and I'm trying to think of the school.
Speaker 2: How old was she when she came up here?
Speaker 1: Lucy Flower High School [Lucy Flower Technical School, now Al Raby High School for Community and Environment in Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: How old was she when she came to Chicago?
Speaker 1: Dang, I'm trying to think.
Speaker 2: About year would it have been?
Speaker 1: About twelve.  I can't, I wish I knew.  I can't recall off hand.  It was in the, somewhere around, let's say around 1919 or something like that, somewhere around in there.  I would say something like that.
Speaker 2: Was she here during the riot?
Speaker 1: She never mentioned it.  I, I can't recall.  She never mentioned it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: She never mentioned it.
Speaker 2: She, she graduated from Lucy Flower.
Speaker 1: Lucy Flower.  She graduated from--and then after that with the family and everything else she went to--so she was a great dressmaker.  So, I get that artistic side and everything else, you know, for certain comes, comes from her and you know how the old dressmaker was, man they, all they do is look at, at, at a pattern, look at a dress and everything else, man, boom and record it right there and she could go home and do it and all this other, so she sold on the side and that's how she helped with the income.  Hey we got four kids, man, you know.  So, at any rate that's what she did.  So, she went to school and she graduated from dress design school.  She was so, so good that the woman who owned the school--I know it was 45th and King, Saint--what was that South Parkway then 'cause it wasn't King Drive, South Parkway.  And the woman who owned the school wanted her to become a business partner with her.  She was that good.  She, she was somebody who absorbed all the aspects of it and had the business head to go with it.

Speaker 1: You were talking about your mother [Carrie Stone Ford] and we were--and your parents [Thomas Ford, Jr.] both sound like fascinating people.  Your mother was an artist of sorts as a quilt maker and--did your grandmother [Bessie Stone] live with you too?
Speaker 2: My grandmother lived down, she lived about two blocks from us [Chicago, Illinois].  And so we lived in this great big building and everything, and my grandmother had a house and so we stayed more time, as much time down at my grandmother's as we did ours because it was larger, much more freedom, and she was such a loving, you know, and of course with that discipline and everything else, you know, so, I meant they love you, but man they knew how to put down that discipline.  You know you had to say "Yes ma'am" and "No ma'am" and you know all the stuff that went along with coming up as a kid during those times she reinforced that.  You know, no back talk and everything else.  If she told you to do something, you did it, and you didn't mumble under your breath or you lost your teeth, you know all that kind of stuff.  You know and she was big in the church, so you know I had to go to Sunday school--
Speaker 1: What, what denomination was this?
Speaker 2: Methodist.
Speaker 1: Is this A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal], C.M.E.?
Speaker 2: AME.
Speaker 1: AME.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, C.M.E., I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: CME.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause it was Colored Methodist Episcopal.
Speaker 1: And then it became Christian [Methodist Episcopal].
Speaker 2: Right, and it changed and you know so--(unclear)--laughter.  Anyway she was the type of person, real strong, real, she was, she was jet black, had real long, long hair and everything else and very strong forceful loving person.  And you could see where my mother and everything, you could see that kind of the gene pool and everything else.  Organized anybody anytime, don't stand, don't take nothing, you know, stand up for your rights, all that kind of stuff; that was my grandmother.  And so she was just, just fascinating, you know.
Story_ID: 67156
Speaker 1: Did they [his maternal grandparents, Bessie Stone and William Stone] have any family stories about, about slavery in those days?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well what we would get, when I was coming up you would get the slavery stories when-let's say when the whole family got together around Thanksgiving time and everything else.  If we were good, then we would ask, you know, "How was slavery?"  And they didn't want to--it was so traumatic still, and they didn't want to talk about.  But, we were just fascinated with how you survived it, how you got over it and everything else and so they would tell us stories about slavery.  And my father [Thomas Ford, Jr.] would from the stuff that he knew, but everything was you had to kind of pull it from him because the trauma stuff had still, you know, still, was still there, pardon me, and not only that so many people in the family had been lynched and so, you know, the more you, the older you got and everything else slavery and the lynching all that stuff it, it's just part and parcel of being abused as a black citizen in this country.  And they would let bits and pieces out and everything else and then you'd understand how sometimes they could be so bitter and how they wouldn't talk about it.  I mean, sure enough lynching, I mean God, man.
Speaker 1: Can, can you remember any of those stories?
Speaker 2: Yeah, for instance one time my grandmother's cousin she disappeared.  You know during the Second War World [World War II] when blacks was getting, were able to get jobs and you know factories, other places and everything else because of the shortage, manpower shortage and all that stuff, I believe she was kind of fair, probably brown skinned I, I can't recall.  But, at any rate, she disappeared.  She had gotten a job and she just disappeared.  You know no big time job.  No, no places on the line or like that, just got a job and blacks hadn't had this kind of job and everything else, so she disappeared.  I recall vividly, and I try not to get emotional about it, but any rate (pause) that they were waiting for the telegram to come, you know, said what happened to her and we were at the house waiting for the telegram to come--I was a small kid you know, but certain things, man, you know when it comes in, you know, you know, you, you don't forget it last you a lifetime.  So, they found her.  They had kidnapped her, raped her, and beat her with a 2 x 4 with spikes in it above the head and everything else.  So I got, imagine the head was about that size and everything else when they found her.  You know they did everything they wanted to her and everything else.
Speaker 1: This was in Georgia?
Speaker 2: This is in Georgia, you know, and--
Speaker 1: This is like around World War II?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.  So, it was so traumatic.  I shouldn't have told that.
Speaker 1: Take your time.  It's something that needed to be told.
Speaker 2: But, stuff like that, you know, you remember.  It was World War 'cause it was so much with the jobs opening up here in, you know, in the North and in the South and everything else, but it was something that really, really stuck, you know.  So, you know, and, and, I mean that's one that's real, real, real, real vivid and so the more the old man talked the more my mother talked and everything else you know you heard all the stuff that they had seen.  But, it was just so--and, and it's like pulling, it had to be a certain thing that, that would trigger it for it to come out and then you could get an understanding of it and everything else why they were bitter and stuff like that at times, you know.
Story_ID: 67157
Speaker 1: And so my father [Thomas Ford, Jr.], you know, he used to talk about the stuff that how some friends they had been killed in business.  And this has been--they were, everything was moonshining and how they killed them and burned them.  You know the whole thing was to burn you after all that and every other thing.  He said "They burned him so totally and everything the only thing was left was the leather on his shoes and everything else," you know.  So, that was a trau, traumatic thing and so, so all these stories and you can understand that whole psychological thing of what hap, what had happened, you know that just depend upon the situation they start telling you something, you know.  So between that and you know and again you get the slavery with my grandmother [Bessie Stone], what her grandmother would tol, had told her.  So we, we got all of that.  So, you came up with that, that whole sense and whole feeling of, you know, kind of what it was like in a sense.  You know, they just when they told you, man, it, it just grabbed, it just grabbed your heart and just, just wrenched in there and pulled it out and so it stuck with you.  So, you had an idea that you were not ever going to be in that kind of position and they never did 'cause a lot of kids in our area, in our neighborhood, you know, during the summer they would, the parents would let 'em go to the South, you know, and visit folk.  Never, we never went South and no way.  My father said under, "Over my dead body you will go down South."  And when I was, when I was in the Air Force and I was stationed in Mississippi and my father and I, we were super tight.  We, we were, he, he was my man and I asked him, you know, I said when I came home on leave one time I said, "Dad give me that, give me the, you know address of, you know, some of your folks and everything and down there and everything else and I'd visit them and everything else."  Shoot, man, he cut me off like I don't what, man, and I, I said dang he won't say a word.  I thought I'd ask my mother [Carrie Stone Ford].  She said, she said, "You know what will happen," she said "here you are a soldier, you got on a uniform and you got to one of those small towns in Mississippi and everything else and you gonna act like you act up here and said the next thing you know you're dead."  Said and that's why he won't talk to you or give--I never did, never got, I never--that's why I don't know the towns and everything 'cause he wouldn't tell me the town let alone an address or anything, wouldn't tell me none of that, so that's all the experience that he'd had gone through.  So, I never, not in Mississippi man, never, never, visited anybody that for certain.
Speaker 2: None of that ever came out during the funeral or anything when he died.  He never--you don't remember anything--(unclear)--
Speaker 1: Unh uh.
Story_ID: 67158
Speaker 1: All right can you tell me something about Chicago [Illinois] back in--I guess you were born in '35' [1935] and you were growing up during the height of Bronzeville [Chicago, Illinois] and what it, what it was like, you know, growing up on the South Side of Chicago in those days?
Speaker 2: Interesting, interesting, interesting.  When they call it, when they call it "the black belt" they wasn't lying about the black belt 'cause it was so narrow, you know.  We couldn't go--I lived on 47th and Wabash and the school was on 47th and Dearborn, and three blocks down was Wentworth.  You were careful walking past going over to Wentworth.  The line again when I was a kid was Cottage Grove.
Speaker 1: Now what would happen if you--
Speaker 2: They beat your butt from now until.  I mean sure enough when I say got a beating, you got a sure enough be, if you were lucky.  You know, so it was always warfare on those--so it was just a narrow band, you know, and it went all the way down to the 30s and 20s [Chicago, Illinois streets].  And when they said black belt they literally meant black belt.  You was just like you were, you were hemmed in, in a sense, you know.
Speaker 1: Well, I know this sounds naive, but for the benefit of people who see this in the future well what about the police?
Speaker 2: Shoot, the police were the biggest thugs going, man.  And I--let, let me, let me put like this in, in our building to show you we lived two blocks, one block from the police station.  So, you know what went on down there and guys would pay to get into 48 Street Station, 48th and Wabash.  They would pay to get a job.  There, there was a waiting list of detectives who wanted because it was so lucrative in terms of the payoffs and all this other kind of stuff.  Not only that, you knew it firsthand because in our building, we lived on the third floor, on the fifth floor was a whorehouse.  White woman owned the whorehouse.  Sharp, I mean, it was really, I mean it was like you see in the movie stuff and everything else.  So, she had a stable of women and everything, you know.
Speaker 1: Upscale?
Speaker 2: I mean sure enough upscale.  I mean this was like going into another world.  There were times we get a little peak in the door and stuff and, and everybody wanted to carry her groceries or do something like that for her because she always paid well.  Bottom line was how they stayed in business and everything else.  The policemen were most of her clients or they brought the clients there.  So, we never had to worry about getting mugged in our hallway because man it subject to be a policemen coming up the stairs and you trying, somebody trying to mug a policemen and everything.  So, it would be Irish cops and I mean the Irish were, the Irish were the controlling element in terms of the police and everything else, you know, and so you knew what side your bread was buttered on and everything else, but you saw front, nobody had to tell you a thing.  Even like the stuff going on now in terms about the priests and everything, bu, bu, abusing kids and going out and doing all this other kind of stuff, you know.  Man that was common, you know.  You see, you know here this whole black, all black neighborhood and they run the thing and you see this white guy with a black jacket on, black shirt, and black pants and everything else and he's walking down on 47th and Prairie, around 47th and Calumet he going to the whorehouse.  So when you saw that it was common--(unclear)--you know police never bothered, never stop, and nobody ever touched him either.  Nobody ever touched those priests, you know, 'cause you know the priests would, would be on your tail and everything.  They, they know how to get who, who's doing what, so we knew at firsthand what the whole deal was like in terms of with the police.
Story_ID: 67159
Speaker 1: So, you had a, a vivid thing of it and you know it was, it was just, it [Bronzeville in Chicago, Illinois] was a very, very difficult and interesting, very difficult, interesting neighborhood.  You saw and did every,--saw people do everything to people and, and etc.  People were--when you got people jammed in like that, you know, what else can you expect.  But, my father [Thomas Ford, Jr.] always had a thing with me and my brother.  He always said this, he said look, he said "You eat well, you dress well, you know, you don't have to get me out of a tavern, you don't have to get your mother out of a tavern."  He said, "everything is straight around here and all that."  He said, "therefore you have no excuse for getting into trouble."  And he was adamant.  The old man look when I said he had grey eyes, man his eyes start dancing man you in trouble, you know, so (laughter).  He would say, he'd say look if you mess up you in.  He said if you go to jail I will not come to see you, I will not allow your mother [Carrie Stone Ford] to come to see you.  He said "and whatever time you got you gonna do it, but we will not be there."  He said, "I can guarantee you that."  He said, "So now you can understand, you see, you know what they do to you in the prisons and all this other kind--he said you are on your own.  It would be different if you wasn't raised right and all this other kind of stuff," so that kind of kept us in line, man, because the guys would--thuggish things were going on.  I mean, you got folks living all on top of people, doing everything to folk, and I've seen so many people die, being killed, and all that other kind of stuff.  It was common, you hear what I'm saying.  Stepping over a body when you leaving going down the stairs, you know in the morning to go to school.  Guys had OD'ed out there, you know, so that stuff was common.  You know the hookers and all that kind of stuff, so he always kept us in-line with that.  You have no excuse, and if you do mess up you were in, that is your problem period.  He said and we would be on the truck driving he said we go by Joliet Prison.  He said, "You see all those black folk out there?  See all those black women?  They going to see their sons and husbands and brothers and everything else."  He said, "That's a shame."  He said, "I'm not gonna be in that kind of crowd."  He says, "You mess up if you wanna."  He said, "You don't have to worry."  He said "your mother won't be there; I won't be there."  Man, so that kept my brother and I straight, you know, 'cause guys would go and break in places, man, steal, rob.  I had some of the thuggish friends that you ever wanna, that ever wanna think about.  I mean, sure enough short of being gangsters.  I mean, they were, they were that bad back then, you know.  And for instance sometimes guys would wanna go when you finish playing, a guy say, "Hey man we going and we gon' break in some stores or we gon' hold up some people and we gon' do something like this."  Man, I said, "Hey can't do it."  I guess that's why I'm not in prison now, you know, because when they got ready to do all that kind of crazy stuff and everything else, man, I said unh uh and it was nice they didn't put pressure on us.
Story_ID: 67160
Speaker 1: That was interesting, but, yeah so we're talking about a community where the black community from what I've read and what you're saying and what other folks said is jammed into a geographical area where you got all kinds of people you're living with regardless sometimes of what your economic station is your proximity to those that are doing great things and the not so great is, I mean you, you can't escape either one of them, they're there right?
Speaker 2: And they would, even the areas that were real good like you go up on South Parkway you know when we were a kid you know you kind of got a little clean going up that direction 'cause that was, that was the main strip.  I mean, it was big time, man, I mean and you know it, it was just where you went and every other thing the Regal Theater [Chicago, Illinois] and the Met Theater [Metropolitan Theater, Chicago, Illinois] and everything that was, that was the class of the class, you know, and so you kind of had to be, you know, together.  You just didn't walk in there like you would normally be dressed and everything else, you know.  So, you got all these sharp, diverse things going on, and so what they did was so many people were coming up from the South they started to cut the apartments up and then we got the kitchenettes.  So, a big apartment on let's say what we call King Drive now--you know when the white folks, the Potter Palmers and all those folk lived in.  I mean, those apartments were elegant, big ones now.
Speaker 1: Townhouses and Greystones.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  So what they would do, excuse me, what they would do, man, they would carve those fellows up where it was for one family.  Now you get about six to eight families in there.  So, that became, you know said dang, so you, people on top of people on top of people, you know, and, and sharing one kitchen.  You know, eight families sharing one kitchen, man, and one, maybe one or two bathrooms, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I, I didn't realize that until that area 'cause I'm not from--(unclear)--is that area was the, started to be developed in the '80's [1980s].  I know some people that bought those, those home to try to develop them and I found out then that those Greystones may have had ten different families.
Speaker 2: And you went up in there man, you had a talking about an eye-opener (laughter) shoot, woo, I mean you saw everything, you know, how you literally saw everything, you know, and either you grow or it just takes you under.  Well, you know it was one of those kind of things, you know.
Story_ID: 67161
Speaker 1: Can you recall some of the sights, sounds, and smells of, of Bronzeville [Chicago, Illinois], I guess as you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the sites you know, the Regal Theater was a class and then you, all you do is walk two or three blocks you know, and--I mean you put on your best clothes.  You can go to the Regal Theater looking like, you know--put on your best clothes and everything to go to see Count Basie and Duke Ellington, you know that was, that was a big thrill for us, man, that's big time, man, and lines four or five blocks long to see them.  And so they were our heroes and starts and everything else.  The Met Theater [Metropolitan Theater] had the best pictures and so that was a class act.  So, all you had to do was go about five or six blocks, man, and you know you into the all of the chitlin' circuit, I mean, all of the smells of chicken, shrimp, and all, I mean, good stuff, but it was just, it was so much on the, the visual and you know all the effects on you were, it was just tremendous.  I mean, from one end you go down the wrong street you get robbed, the other street you have no problem.  So, you had to have your wits about you at all times all the time, you know.
Story_ID: 67162
Speaker 1: Were there gangs in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Ooh God yes.  I mean now they got, the gangs are sophisticated now.  They've been trained, you know, with the Blackstone Rangers [Black Peace Stone Nation] and all them.  The University of Chicago helped those guys get they act together, write grants, hey tell it like it is and the "Defender" did a whole thing on them, man, in terms of that.  I hear Andy talk about that all the time too, but hey they helped those guys--
Speaker 1: Anderson Thompson.
Speaker 2: Yeah Anderson Thompson, man it is a whole history in terms of that.  But, they helped those gangs get organized.  That's why President [Richard] Nixon invited them to his inauguration, man.  He--the Blackstone Rangers going to Nixon's inauguration.  Something had to be going on, but in my day those guys they would die out, you know.  Half of them would go to prison, get killed, or whatever, so you got another cycle coming in and everything else.  But, they were extremely, extremely prevalent in power.  You know you had, you knew what area you had to, you existed in and what area you dealt in and everything else.
Speaker 1: Was the same games prevalent then that are--
Speaker 2: No, they've changed and everything.  They had the Four Corners, the Deuces, and I'm trying to think of some--the B's and everything, I mean, and it worked all the way up.  The each little, each group, age group in a sense for so many years had their own little gang group under another umbrella and all that other kind of stuff.  It was vicious.
Story_ID: 67163
Speaker 1: So, let me ask you about school.  What school did you go to?
Speaker 2: I went to Coleman, Coleman public on si, 46th and Dearborn.
Speaker 1: Did you go to one school your whole--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Um-hum, um-hum, um-hum, um-hum.
Speaker 1: And what, what was Coleman?
Speaker 2: Interesting 'cause a lot of teachers my mother [Carrie Stone Ford] had had, you know, we getting 'em, you know, and but again it was such a depressed area, man.  Look 47th Street and Dearborn, it's hard giving people an idea of what it was like and everything else, but all you had to do was just--Dearborn, Federal all that area had been the incoming place for all, all the immigrants.  The French, the Germans, the Irish, the Jews, and the Italians.  Now you can imagine how you got one ethnic group after the other, you know, waves coming through.  You could imagine what the housing looked like, man, it was depressing.  Ain't no ifs, ands, or buts about it.  Places haven't been painted since eons ago, man.
Speaker 1: So, so when--
Speaker 2: Hadn't seen any paint, man.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, so when one group got enough resources they moved on.
Speaker 2: They moved on.
Speaker 1: And then--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And then you got the wave of the other, the other was coming in, so the blacks of course we were the last coming in, so again and so therefore my, like my mother and--my mother would always say and everything, you know, people talking about integration and everything, said "We went to school with whites.  And most of them could speak a little Italian, a little Yiddish, and every now and then you had a family or two that could speak a little German" because all these groups had come in and everything, you know so, it made it, made it very, very interesting.  School was strong.  They demanded a lot, you know, and the whole thing with, you know, of course you had to pass.  Man, you know it wasn't like it is today, you know, you, you couldn't--my mother always said you know "Don't bring any bad grades in unless you retarded.  If you retarded, I can understand it."  And they always say "Are you retarded?"  So, no, no bad grades ever came in, so man and they beat up on you and 'cause the teachers almost like had permission now if you weren't, kind of got out of hand they kind of pop on you and jack you up and do all--they had all kind of little devices and everything else.  So, that kind of kept you straight, which was good.  You had discipline.  And then they taught us, and we had a sense in terms of history and everything else because a lot as I said before, a lot of them had gone to some good black colleges and they had taught them African American history and they put it on us.  You [Paul Laurence] Dunbar, you know, Countee Cullen and all.  Man, we had to know those.  We had to memorize--those kids--we had to memorize those, those poets and writers when you was this big in school, man, I mean remember, I mean stand up there and memorize in front of the class.  I mean, you had to spout all this stuff out.  Man, we had the Black National Anthem we sung at assemblies.  So, it was a pretty militant setting, you know, and, and if you didn't crack, you know, they, they were on your case because they could contact and talk to your parents and everything.  "I knew your mother, don't you act a fool in my class, you know, I'll call her up."  So, people were just getting jobs, you know, in the war.  Nobody is gonna miss a day off and you halfway starved all this time to come and check on your kids.  That was almost a no, no.  So, when they threatened the kids, say well "I'mma call your mother and have her come up to school," man that was like, you know, God is gon' kill you; that's all there is to it.  You gon' die right then and there if your parent had to come 'cause they had to take a day off of work.  They just trying, just getting themselves together from the [Great] Depression.  We just getting the jobs in these factories, so therefore it was stressful.  When they came, when they came to class to kind of give you that idea, when they came, when a parent came to class they bit the shit, excuse me, they beat the hell out of the kids in front of the class, man.  "You act a fool, bam."  I have seen parents beat kids--they used to have the long window poles that you pull the windows down at top, I seen them beat the hell out of 'em, man.  Kids stand up there and take the blows, man.  I mean because they had to take a day off of work and you knew that and you were raised better and --(unclear)--was a no, no.  And what you gon' be a dishwasher? Like me?  You gon' be like me and so all those kind of things and so we--
Speaker 1: Was the--was the schools more disciplined then?
Speaker 2: Oh gosh yes.
Speaker 1: In terms of, okay.
Speaker 2: So, teachers kind of halfway knew everybody and you know knew your family and all that.  They lived in the neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Was there a high dropout rate like it is now or?
Speaker 2: Well, when people a lot of times, especially in high school, it would happen that when people could, you know, you get the jobs and jobs would come much more plentiful and everything else.  And, and again the pressure of your family and other stuff people would, you know, drop out and, and you know go on and work in the factory 'cause they had everything, steel mill, stock yards, all that kind of stuff.  You know, going to all the kind of factors and everything else going and so you could kind of halfway readily get a job, you know, when they start to open up a little bit.
Story_ID: 67164
Speaker 1: Now what kind of young man were you in school [Coleman Elementary School]?  Were you a good student?  Were you friendly,--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --shy, or what, what kind of per, person were you?
Speaker 2: Kind of in between.  Good student.  I always had--that was mandatory at home, you know.  There was no such thing as you bringing any--it can't even be borderline.  You know if you supposed to get 100 on a test, you get a 100 on the test, you know, and you know you gon' catch it.  So, they always stayed after us on that because they said--it always became important.  So, I was always a good student in school.  Even in Sunday school you had to be good.  My grandmother [Bessie Stone], you come, and that's why, you know, when you talking to students today and everything they figure that you talk about spiritualism in Africa and everything else.  I said "I know the Bible too."  I said "I had to know it, you know, if my grandmother didn't go to church or something like--you didn't go to, to the movies unless you went to Sunday school and/or church."  And the movies was it 'cause we didn't have television, you know, so that was it.  So, it was, you know--people say "You too sick to go to Sunday school, then you don't go out for the rest of the day.  You don't do anything but stay in the house."  Now that was sudden death.  Everybody gone to the show, everybody eating popcorn and carrying on and all that kind of stuff and you locked in at home just because you didn't go to Sunday school plus you had to be good in Sunday school 'cause my mother and grandmother would catch you on what was, what was, what was, what was the sermon about, what was the lesson about.  You had to give them a detailed explanation and everything, break it down, analyze it and everything else.  So, you know, you caught it, so actually you, you it, it forced you to be a good student.  My father [Thomas Ford, Jr.] was great in math, you know.  Having problems in math and everything else he could figure the problems out in his head.
Story_ID: 67165
Speaker 1: Well, what did you, what did you think--what were your aspirations as a child did you, did you--what did you want to be when you grew up?
Speaker 2: I wanted to be earlier, I wanted to be really in high school is when it started to formulate and kind of come in and everything else.  And I wanted to be, I wanted to be an architect.  I really wanted to be an architect.  But, we were good enough, but the math wasn't there.  That was the whole thing.  I was a good math student and everything else, but when you start getting up there to the higher stuff and everything else, you know, it start to kind of fail a little bit, you know.  If we probably had had tutors and were in a better situation, I'd probably been an architect today.  And so I loved the art.  I was great in drafting and all that.  So, all the stuff around the art, architecture and everything else I've always loved.  I've just, just ate it up, you know, just, just a given for me and everything.  Always good in biology, zoology and all that stuff.  And so my sisters went in because in terms of art I guess I wanted to be--to kind of give you an idea my sister was great in art and the whole thing was my mother [Carrie Stone Ford] and them said you know "Why you wanna be an artist, you can't make any money, you gon' starve to death and all that kind of stuff."  So, they went into medicine, you know, so both of them became medical technician.  My sister was, you know, director of a blood bank and everything else, all that kind--you know way up the ladder and all that kind of stuff, you know, but the force, the family forced them into-whereas a boy, you know hey you can kind of, yeah you (laughter), but you not, you aren't dumb, you know, you know you can kind of make your way much better than the girls.  We can kind of put the, put the muscle on them and everything, you know. And so that's how I kind of gravitated--my father [Thomas Ford, Jr.] wanted me to be in business and I always said I used to tell my wife [Thelma Ford] this all the time I said, "Every now and then I would think about it," I said, "we would have four or five homes by now, I mean some sure enough big time homes and everything 'cause my father had connections and things were opening up for blacks in business and all that kind of stuff and I would have been in it 'cause he taught me well."  But, I told him one day I said, "Look" I said, "I appreciate you helping me and going with you and everything else," I said, "but I, I like books and I like art and every other thing and I'm good at it."  I said, "You know what do you think?"  I thought he was gon' fall out.  I thought he was gon' really hit the ceiling and everything else.
Story_ID: 67166
Speaker 1: He [Ford's father, Thomas Ford, Jr.] was so calm and cool about it when I told him I wanna be an artist 'cause I found out I could carve.  I could take a piece of wood, man, and whatever image I could, I mean really good at it, you know.  And he saw me and everything else and he said--I said, "Dad I went to the--(unclear)--and I was good in whatever I did, you know, classes and stuff."  And he said, "I tell you what," he said "if that's what you wanna do and I know you love books and everything else," he said, "that's what you wanna do and everything else go on and do it."  He said, "I trust you."  He said, "but you know something," he said, "one thing I can tell you this," he said, "I know you will be good at whatever you do he said but remember I taught you how to make a living.  You will never ever starve."  He said, "You got a brain, you saw how I used mine.  We never starved, we never went without or anything like that."  He said, "Now I expect the same thing out of you," and that's the way, that's the way it went down, you know.  And I was so proud of him and everything, and he never ever threw it back up in my face, you know "Well, you know see things are kind of tough, what's up?" like that, you know, and never did.  You know, he was always in my corner 100 percent, man.  So, that, that, that part, that was great.  My mother [Carrie Stone Ford] was, of course, the same way.  You know how mothers are, "Hey go on and do it" 'cause the gift ran in the family, but it's not something that you just threw out I gotta be an artist 'cause everybody's good at it.  It just ran in the family, but the brain part all that, it was just a kind of balance.  You could be what you wanna be in science or whatever.  One time they thought I was gon' be a chemist.  I was, I always had a chemistry set and stuff, you know, so all that kind of good stuff.

Speaker 1: DuSable High School now when you were there you had, you were there during the heyday at DuSable?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: From what I've read, that time period and the--this would be in the early '50's [1950s] can you just talk about--now, now DuSable was named--who was it named after?
Speaker 2: Jean Baptiste Point DuSable--
Speaker 1: Okay he was?
Speaker 2: --first black settler [of Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: And in Bronzeville [Chicago, Illinois] is it true they're only really two black high schools, Phillips [Wendell Phillips Academy High School] and DuSable--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Phillips and yeah 'cause Phillips burned down [on January 28, 1935] and that's how they--and DuSable was supposed to have been this big 'cause it was a new school and everything else and they just had to stop, building was gon' be much larger than what it was and so everybody moved from Phillips because the building had burned down from Phillips to DuSable.  See, and my mother's brothers went to DuSable, so I wanted to go.
Speaker 1: I never knew that the, the original Phillips High School bur, burned--
Speaker 2: Burned down, yeah.
Speaker 1: I didn't know it.
Speaker 2: That's a new one there than the one that sat on 39th [Street].  So, that was the whole thing was and I wanted--it's like people going to college and everything, I wanted to go to DuSable.  That was the place to go 'cause it was, not only was--it was challenging, it was fun and you know, but it was the kind of school where as--'cause it is a wider range of people that you came in contact, but all these folk as opposed to my neighborhood on 47th Street, these people from the 50's and all down in those areas and everything they were go getters, man, I mean a lot of those people, you know, smart in class and it was the whole atmosphere there and where the teachers would press, press you and everything else.  Excellent, excellence was the name of the game and if you wanted anything you kind of trifling, you know, "What you gon' do with your life?"  You know everybody was going away, going to school, U of I [University of Illinois], and all these other kind of places, so you wanted to be somebody when you got out of there, not just stop after you got out of high school get a job, so it was that upward mobility and that you could be something.  We had Captain Dyett in terms of music.  All the great jazz musicians just about they came out of DuSable, man.  DuSable yeah--
Speaker 1: Captain Walter Dyett.
Speaker 2: Captain Walter dy, dy, Dyett.  Most of the--
Speaker 1: Can you spell his last name for us?
Speaker 2: D-Y-E-T [sic, D-Y-E-T-T], I think it is.  Yeah, D-Y-E-T, I believe it is.  Walter Dyett and he was so demanding and everything else that the band was superior now not excellent, superior.  And if you wanted superior, you know, he talked about you and your mama and every other, everything, but a physical beating you got.  You know, so you had--and it was the competition, so you know you had Gene Ammons.
Speaker 1: Were you involved in a band.
Speaker 2: No my uncle was involved the band, you know so you kind of--(unclear)--all the stories and everything were true about Captain Dyett, you know he--
Speaker 1: So go ahead and name the people, I'm sorry I didn't mean to cut you off.
Speaker 2: Gene Ammons, you know--Gene Ammons came through there, Nat King Cole to name a few.  Matter of fact, Nat King Cole came back to and did a performance for us in school and everything, you know, so all the heavies, anybody who wanted--Dorothy Donegan, anybody who wanted to be somebody, man, was in competition in the band and everybody was fighting for a position and all this other kind of stuff, so it was nothing but excellence there.  So, all the way through it was the De La Salle [Institute] for black folk, man, because like the Irish had De La Salle, we had DuSable.  [Chicago] Mayor Harold Washington went there, the first police chief, you know, we could do the whole list in terms of the people that went to school were doctors, lawyers, I mean, people of the highest scale and everything else.  People just had that thing.  You know when you meet somebody "What you doing with yourself, man?"  Well you know, you feel bad.  You say, "I didn't have a degree or I'm going to college, I'm not going to college" or something like that.  It was that kind of, you know, do it, you know.
Story_ID: 67168
Speaker 1: So, you know this is--I mean it [DuSable High School in Chicago, Illinois] was just a great place to go.  It became so famous they had the Hi-Jinks at DuSable.  People say why was it so important.  The Hi-Jinks, man, everybody got dressed up and when it was about four days, I think Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, and the students put it on, they earned money.  It was a top drawer performance and everything.  I'm not talking about nickel or dime stuff.  This was the kind of stuff you could almost see at The Regal [Theater].  The students put it on because there was not enough money for musical instruments.  So the money that--
Speaker 2: Okay, now this is a show--
Speaker 1: This is a show that--
Speaker 2: --that students give for the general public.
Speaker 1: That's right and they call it the Hi-Jinks.
Speaker 2: To raise money for the school.
Speaker 1: To raise money for the school, so the money went back into the instru, to buying instruments, 'cause we poor folk, man, we can't afford all that kind of stuff and everything else.  So, it went back into that, you know.  So, the band was always su, I just said, superior, you know.  So, that's how they got their money and it was the biggest attraction.  Man, you, you, I mean that's, that's part of your year going to the Hi-Jinks.  Your mother went, your aunt, your uncle.  People lined up for a block to get into the Hi-Jinks, man, every night of the week that it ran.  And you say "Woo, so I wanted to go to DuSable," you know, (laughter), and that's the way it was.  And I always, and I always teased my, my--I used to tease my wife and always tell her--she went to Parker.  Parker was kind of, it was just barely had a few blacks in there and you know they thought they was such ritzy and all this other kind of stuff, you know, and I always tell her I said, "Look we have a camaraderie and that's true it still is.  Camaraderie about people who go to DuSable High School; we stick together.  There's like a clique and everything else."  I said, "You went to [Francis W.] Parker High School.  You guys can't even get enough people to hardly have a reunion."  I said "We have a reunion, man, you gotta--if you don't get your tickets early, you don't get in."  I said, "This the way it is" and so and I used to tease her and all that; she would get so mad at me, you know, I said, said "You and your middle class stuff."  I said we must, we were poor, I said but and that's the difference now because I had so many friends and that's why I won't go back there now 'cause it hurts you so bad.  Friends who, you know, taught at DuSable.  You know, we got our degrees and everything else and it's such a drag to see what has happened to that great school and everything else.
Story_ID: 67169
Speaker 1: You were talking about DuSable High School [Chicago, Illinois] and how special it was with Hi-Jinks and the other factors of Dusab, I mean other important aspects to DuSable, and can you talk about some of the other students there that you ran into and, and what were they doing and, and--I think you named a few of 'em, but, but what, what, what was some of the other outstanding students or students that were friends of yours that were at DuSable?
Speaker 2: For instance, let me give you the name, DuSable was the black basketball team to go down state and compete to get down to the final [in 1954] and everything else.  And these guys were the elite 'cause we put them up there on that pedestal and they deserved it, man, the first ones to go down there, go down state and all this other kind of stuff.  They gave me an award.  And so what they did was to show that, that camaraderie, pull themselves together as a group and they would give awards out to people who were doing outstanding things in the community.  The graduates of DuSable.
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Man, I mean I was so proud I didn't know what to do.  And, and 'cause I ran track, you know, and nothing glamorous like basketball, you know, but here I was an athlete also, but again the recognition and what they did and how they did it and everything else.  And it kind of gives you that idea, you know Lumpkin and you know the Brown brothers and all those guys.  Man, they still around teaching, doing their thing and everything else.  You know, the community means something, so--
Speaker 1: What was the name of the team?
Speaker 2: The DuSable Panthers they were called.  I mean, they were just awesome, and nobody, you know, fast breaking and all the stuff that's popular in basketball now and everything else 'cause they always--
Speaker 1: Can you name the starting five?
Speaker 2: Ah man, I've forgotten.  You know, let's see [Paxton] Lumpkin, [HM Charles] Brown, [Shellie] McMillian, said Lumpkin, Brown, McMillian.  I'm trying to think--and one of the fellows lived across the street from me.  I'm trying to think, Bobby [Jackson], I'm trying think of Bobby's last name.  And it was somebody, it was somebody else.  I'm trying to think of his name.  It, it escapes me now, but at any rate- [Karl Dennis]
Speaker 1: --(Unclear)--
Speaker 2: But yeah, oh but I mean Chicago when they went down state and played, man, the whole South Side froze, man, I mean.  That was like when Joe Louis would box.  You know you could (laughter), when Joe Louis would box we were kids the South Side would totally freeze.  You could go outside on 47th Street as busy as it was lay out in the middle of the street and nobody run over you.  Everybody's at, at a radio.
Speaker 1: Similar to when [Michael] Jordan played in those championships.
Speaker 2: There you go and that was the same thing, man, and when, when DuSable played, man, there was not a sole out.  Everything was just as clear, the streets, but ever, even the dogs went inside, you know.  Everybody's checking out 'cause that was the first time we'd ever gone down there, you know.  Mount Vernon [Township High School, Illinois] and all those other places always never, never could get anywhere, you know.  And after that, the flood, you know, door opened then.
Story_ID: 67170
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know there have been books written about it and somebody will probably do some tele program soon or later, but you had Walter Dyett in the, in the band, you had some of those great entertainers, the DuSable Panther basketball team going on then, and what other outstanding aspects of DuSable can you remember?
Speaker 2: I, I know we were good in biology and all departments were relatively strong.  People kind of beat up on you, I mean tough, I mean it wasn't now, you know, give you a pass and all this other kind of stuff.  They really taught you how to, how to study and everything.  I, I remember they were, they were so touch on us in biology and everything that when I went to University of Chicago [in Illinois] and everything I, I would think I said man you think how tough exams could be and everything else, but I said, "Look one thing for certain it kind of prepared me at DuSable for a good old head whipping what you were getting at the University of Chicago."  But, I was ready for it.  It wasn't where, it was something where they, you were blown out of the water and you'll sink.  You know, you just had to kind of get your act together and be much more of a disciplinarian and all this other kind of stuff.  You know, really take care of business, but DuSable had prepared us enough in biology.  I mean it, I mean it was furiously tough, and man I was, I was top of the mile, man, you know get, getting A's and all that kind of stuff.  So while I wanted to go and you know I thought I said well if I don't be an architect maybe I can be a biologist or maybe a zoologist or something; I was that good in it, you know.  So, it was--they had all the stuff going and everything else, you know.
Story_ID: 67171
Speaker 1: Who, who were some of the outstanding teachers at DuSable [High school]?
Speaker 2: I know it was a Mrs. Brown.  I can't think of--she later on became principal.  And it's kind of hard--and aah man--it was so many and names are kind of slipping away man, you know.  Ah why'd you ask me that one (laughter)?
Speaker 1: I know that I, you know, just, I mean, if you can remember some, but I know you had one outstanding art teacher didn't you?
Speaker 2: Of course, [HM] Margaret Burroughs and she was, she was it, man, she was, she was totally, she was--I remember people used to stay 'cause she was the first one to wear a natural and stuff and she always encouraged us and encouraged us when we, you know, took classes in art and everything else.  Matter of fact 'cause you didn't teach in those days, you didn't teach about Africa.  You could teach about Picasso who was influenced by Africa, but you couldn't teach about Africa.
Speaker 1: Margaret Burroughs you said she wore a natural?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she later on wore a natural.
Speaker 1: You mean she didn't press her hair?
Speaker 2: She didn't press it, so it was and man that was unheard of.
Speaker 1: Yeah, in those days all--
Speaker 2: All the black women pressed their hair and so hers just to be natural and everything else.  Pardon me, they would look at her--I've seen her go down the street and almost stop traffic.  Everybody looking at her and carrying on and everything else, look at it now.
Speaker 1: Why, why do you think that, you know, it's it would be so, considered so outlandish to wear your hair natural?
Speaker 2: It, it it's though--you know we, we brought into that whole thing in terms--I, I--that whole thing in terms of loving yourself and you know and, and your features and everything, your nose and your lips and all that kind of stuff.  We've just been taught so, so strongly that our features, you know, that they are ugly in a sense.  Our hair is ugly, so therefore you gotta straighten it and everything.  And that was a ritual, you know, in my building.  Man they, people burned so much hair on a Saturday night 'cause Sunday you gotta go to church.  Man, you had to hold your nose going in the hallway 'cause the smoke from burning hair, from curling that hot curling iron.  It was so strong in the hallway you couldn't hardly see.  This is, I swear, it was that bad, man, so we had bought into that whole thing.  But, my father [Thomas Ford, Jr.] was always (laughter) he said "If you ever put any of that kind of stuff in your head or any stuff like that he said I'll kill you.  You will not step foot in my house" 'cause the whole thing was to do your hair like Nat King Cole had it all slicked down and the performers and we call 'em a conk or whatever they called, you know, and for all that heavy grease and stuff.  So, that was the in thing.  You had to look like something and somebody else instead of being yourself.  Margaret--it was challenging that whole thing of that you were beautiful and you have to be proud of yourself and everything else and where you came from.  And my father was always in the bag.  He always said that.  He said "You watch my word," he said "one day we gon' be looking in Africa and studying Africa and all this other kind of stuff."  He said, "Africa is gon' be the end thing in terms of black folk."  He said, "You watch what I'm saying."  And Africa back in those days, man, was a no, no.  We were ashamed of ourselves, and here Margaret came along and you know she here studying Africa.  She--'cause you got--if you taught Africa, you got fired 'cause it was not in--if it was not in the curriculum and you deviated from the curriculum and they found out you got fired on the spot; you hear what I'm saying.  Margaret would, she was famous for this, Margaret would put a student on the door to warn her if the principal or somebody or one of the administrators was coming and she would teach about Africa and--
Speaker 1: And this is even in DuSable High School?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And so when the principal or somebody came to the door and everything they had a signal that they would give and then she would stop and change and, and get on one of the European artist or Picasso or somebody like that, you know, and that was all acceptable, anything but your culture.
Speaker 1: So, we're really talking about a war almost, I mean, a battle going on within the black high school.  It's named after a black person teaching black students.  A war about whether we should even talk about Africa.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we'll so many black folk was just, you know, brain washed into that whole thing, you know.  That you gotta be something else, you know, especially it come down to culture and stuff, you know, and so there, there you go that war is right.  It was a real sharp contrast and everything, but some teachers were pretty hip or either they take you aside and say certain things and all this sort of stuff, like in language class or something like that, maybe be a little different, you know.  Like sometimes he Spanish teachers were pretty cool and say "Hey man you come from, your culture is rich you don't want people to talk down on your culture.  Never back down off your culture.  We don't back down off us, off ours, we're from Mexico.  We know you came from a rich culture."  You know it kind of make you, kind of you know hey (laughter) folk you know pulling your coat in any kind of way that they can, under the table, behind the table, or whatever to get you to be, you know, what you ought to be an everything, you know, which was, was cool.  So, I mean, so I, I wouldn't trade going to Coleman and every once in a while you would always say "Thank God for Coleman and thank God for DuSable" because it, again one of those molding things that helped you to be what you, what you really were destined to be, you know.
Story_ID: 67172
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now tell me about your graduation, I mean your last year in Du, DuSable [High School in Chicago, Illinois] and what you--what, what were your aspirations?  You said you wanted to be an artist.  When you, when you graduated from DuSable did you still have that on your mind as being an ar, architecture or an artist or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, at first for awhile I worked with the old man [Thomas Ford, Jr.] and you know that was before and I said shoot.  And then it was time that everybody had to go in the [United States] Army.  You know the Korean stuff came on.
Speaker 1: Now you graduated from DuSable in?
Speaker 2: '53' [1953].
Speaker 1: '53' [1953].
Speaker 2: And see that was the tail end of the Korean War and everything else, so they were still inducting guys and everything.  So, I knew I was gon' have to do some time and everything.  So, I said well--that was again my father was trying to put my sisters through college and everything, so I knew wasn't that money left for me.  They were trying to build a home.
Speaker 1: Where did they go to school?
Speaker 2: Roosevelt.  Both of 'em graduated from Roosevelt University [Chicago, Illinois]   And Roosevelt was, hey Roosevelt was in, man.  Roosevelt was, it was, it was the thing to go, the thing to go 'cause Roosevelt had one of the most dynamic faculties in terms of Africa and African American studies, man.  Some of the stars there, man, you know, and so--
Speaker 1: --(Unclear)--
Speaker 2: Frazier, not Frazier, I'm trying to think of his name who did with, with the, in, in the Sea Island I'm trying to think.  He, he did the whole dictionary in terms of the Sea Island Book.  I'm trying to think of his name.  What's his name?  Ooh shoot, did the whole thing of the Gullah stuff and everything [Lorenzo Dow Turner].  He did the with the whole book because before then they were saying that, you know, blacks didn't, you know, it wasn't a language that we had, you know, we were really broken English stuff from somewhere.
Speaker 1: --(Unclear)--
Speaker 2: I can't think of this guy's name.  Let me see who else was there.  He went on, went on to Stanford University and he wrote a book, "Black Folk Here and [There]"--
Speaker 1: St. Clair Drake.
Speaker 2: St. Clair Drake.  St. Clair Drake 'cause my sister had him, my brother-in-law, you know, so I get the, I get all their papers, man, you know, get the reading list, man, and, I mean St. Clair Drake and one of the other brothers went on to Columbia University [New York City, New York].  I'm trying to think of his name, on the tip of my tongue.  I don't know what's wrong with the thinking buzz today, but anyway it was--
Speaker 1: Charles Hamilton.
Speaker 2: Hamilton, Charles Hamilton.  So, they had the stars there and they would invite the African brothers to come in and lecture, man, it was so, that was, oh now that was, that was like being in Heaven, you know.  So, I was at the Art Institute [School of the Art Institute of Chicago in Illinois].  My sisters were--you know I'd come back from the Service 'cause that's where I went to school because I got the GI Bill of Rights, you know.
Story_ID: 67173
Speaker 1: Can you talk a little bit about your, your, your Service?
Speaker 2: Yeah in the Air Force and all that kind of stuff.  I was glad to get out that's for certain, you know (laughter).  I dealt with and part of my whole thing was when I was in it was I was in Armament and our thing was atomic bomb, loading, arming, and doing all that stuff and studying about the bomb how to, all that kind of stuff.
Speaker 1: Now this was in--you were stationed in Mississippi.
Speaker 2: I was-Mississippi.  I been, hey so many places, Mississippi, that was in Utah, that was in Utah.  I went to Denver [Colorado], the special school for that and all that kind of jazz, you know.  Stuff that you can't still not even supposed to talk about--(unclear)--fighting and stuff man, but anyway--
Speaker 1: How do end up joining the Air Force?
Speaker 2: I said I wanted to get enough money so when I got out it would pay for my education.  It will pay for it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but why the Air Force other than the Army?
Speaker 2: Then Army black guys, hey man say "If you, if you behind the eight ball, say if you don't have this going for you, you in trouble."  They were killing--guys were going into the Marines, you know, and all that kind of stuff and the Army and everything they were, you know, it was always was just bad news man, especially it was at the end of the time in Korea, and they were still fighting and talking, fighting and talking and everything else.  In high school, they always told us, man, at DuSable, they stopped classes and said man "I don't care how dumb you are don't drop out of school.  I don't care if you, you can't even speak don't drop out of school 'cause you know what's gonna happen" and then they started calling roll of the guys who did it and they brought them back in a box.  And that kind of brought it home to you and everything.  So, hey man, going to the Air Force was an easy choice, you know, so I said hey I have my, part of my education paid for and everything else which was true.  All of it kind of worked out right, you know.  So, that part of it, you know, Uncle Sam did a thing, you know.
Story_ID: 67174
Speaker 1: Okay, well I'll get off the Air Force now and you go the money, you're in, so you come back and you go to the Art Institute [School of the Art Institute of Chicago in Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yeah, I went to, I went to interior design school first and I stayed there for a year and I said aye it was okay.  I was good at that and all that kind of jazz I could leave that out.  I was good at it.  And then I went to the Art Institute and I saw what they were doing and I just quit.  I was about the graduate from the, it was Ray-Vogue art school [now the Illinois Institute of Art-Chicago].  I said shoot later for that stuff.  I went to the Art Institute, man, and that was, that was, that was it.  That was a whole new warp.  You know, of course, they didn't have that many black students there.  You know, that's a Harvard [University in Cambridge, Massachusetts] of the art school, you know, it, it was, and I loved it, man, and, it was my cup of tea.  I was really, really good at it, you know.  And I think one of the great things that happened we had a strong camaraderie and we organized ourselves as black students there, and it was only about 30 something or 40 something.  We armed ourselves and we, we kind of did a thing.  We had an organization and we, we supported one another and all this other kind of stuff.  You know and it has continued on, you know, down through the years now as I can understand.  But, I think one of the greatest things that happened there was, of course, you are superbly taught in terms of the art area, but I ran into a professor by the name of Whitney Halstead.  Whitney was a critic and all this other kind of stuff, and Whitney taught, taught African art.  It wasn't called "African Art" in those days.  Sad to say it was called "primitive art," and that hurt to the bone.  And he would also try to explain it 'cause there was no other name.  Just call it what it was supposed to be called.  But, anyway, he was straight.  Whitney was white, 'cause we had no black teacher.  I never had a black college teacher, never.  Nobody even come close, not even an assistant come in and read something.  Nu, nothing like that, none period.  And this man loved Africa and loved the art.  He loved New Guinea and all those places.  And he just took us on, I mean he just opened the door for us, and we were looking for somebody like that.  And so we and the course was extremely difficult.  Matter of fact it was called "primitive art."  We had Native Americans.  We had the islands, you know, Melanesia, Polynesia, etc., and we had Africa.  And we had all that stuff within one year.  It was, it was a killer, it was a killer of a course and black students bonded together.  We always felt that it was a sin to graduate from the institute and not have that man's course.  I don't care how difficult it was.  It was supremely difficult, and that would, you would be armed when you got out and whatever phase you went in art and in life and everything else that you would be armed culturally and everything else and it was so right.  We just had the whole thing.  If you didn't--we didn't hardly want to talk to you if you didn't have this class.
Speaker 1: Now what, how do you spell his name exactly?
Speaker 2: Whitney Halsted, H-A-L-S-T-E-D [sic, H-A-L-S-T-E-A-D], Whitney and he was--and look he just became--you know and he was cool.  He was tough, cool, you know and all this other kind of stuff and so he really became a real good friend.  So, it was difficult getting in on the college level and everything else and he gave me recommendations to get at Chicago State [University in Illinois].  He gave me a dynamic rec, recommendation, so I just loved the man as difficult as he was and everything.  One time I was sick and I apologized for getting a B plus out of this class.  I said "It will never happen again," you know.  So, we was just tight, man, we were bonding, you know, and 'cause he was feeding us about Africa, which was new, man, and he was just, it was something else and so when I came here to Chicago State and I said I gotta get into a funeral art and I wanna do this and everything else and I applied to become a National Endowment of, of the Humanities fellow, and Whitney wrote one of the--it was, it was a dynamic, obviously a dynamic recommendation and everything else and I was one of, I think they only give 124 out in the entire United States, and I got one, you know, so I had some strong people backing me and everything else. So, I brought back a ton of slides and we became real tight after that, you know, but even, I mean tighter after that and everything, you know, but he influenced, you know, my life, you know in terms of my career and everything.
Story_ID: 67175
Speaker 1: So, it became I think pivotal, you know, so now when I went to Africa I was ready, armed, and [HM] Margaret [Burroughs] helped me too.  She was, she was the one who just, she just said "You will change, you will not be the same.  When you come back, you will be a different person.  Africa is gon' change you that much in terms of your art work, your philosophy.  Everything that you do now from now on if you got your wits about you and you just let a little of it seep in and all this other kind of stuff."  So, she was terribly, terri, she was right on, you know, and so--
Speaker 2: So, you basically stayed in contacted with Dr. Burroughs all this time.
Speaker 1: Oh yes, yes, yes, we're still very, very, very, very close, very, very close.  Matter of fact I owe her a phone call now, you know.  She wants me to go work at committee, I mean, these kind of folk I like being around and people that see me come in and out of my life and everything else.  She goes to the prisons and teach, man, and so she tried to get me to go with her the Stateville [Correctional Center in Crest Hill, Illinois] and all up there.  I said, "Margaret that's a little too much for me," but and anyway that's the kind of person she is, you know, and, and she still going.  She said you, "You don't retire, you know, you know artists don't retire.  You know you just keep on working and everything else" and again she's right.  So, the connection has been just like this, you know, all since that time, you know.
Story_ID: 72571
Speaker 1: Well, let's see we were talking about your finishing up at the Art Institute [School of the Art Institute of Chicago in Illinois].  Is there any, any particular memory, that that sticks with you about, about your finishing up at the Art, Art Institute and like what did you do right after you came out the Art Institute?
Speaker 2: Good, good memories and everything else.  You know, hey it was, they had their quota system.  I keep telling people, "They can get mad at me" and I tell 'em in a second, "They had their quota system and every other thing.  I just happen to be one of those who fit into the quota system, and I got through and everything else," I said, "but we couldn't get jobs on the college level."  Art Institute is the Harvard [University] of the art schools.  --(Unclear)--ifs, ands, or butts.  Let's fast track to where you're going, you know what I mean.
Speaker 1: Don't you have a Masters Degree from--
Speaker 2: Yeah I got a M.F.A. from there.  That's, that's it.  You know the M.F.A. is, hey that's like same as having your doctorate 'cause you can't get a doctorate, you know.  So, that is the same, I mean, that's, that's like having a doctorate from Ha, from Harvard, okay.  And we couldn't get jobs, man.  All our white classmates and everything were getting jobs at DePaul [University in Chicago, Illinois], Loyola [University in Chicago, Illinois], and all the other places and everything else, and we couldn't.  So, we had to go into the public school system [Chicago Public Schools and Gary, Indiana Public Schools], so I did a couple of years (laughter), a couple of years at a public school system, then I went to Indiana and did a couple of years, and then I happen to get a chance my brother-in-law was doing recruiting and he was down in Southern University [and A&M College in Baton Rouge, Louisiana] and he asked me, he said "I know the guy who is the chairperson do you want to come down there and it's a possibility of getting a job," and that's how I got the job at Southern.  But, the whole thing is we were frustrated and can you image people like [HM] Margaret [Burroughs] and all the guys and women before them who that you couldn't get anything.  The best education there is, we had to go the University of Chicago [in Illinois].  You couldn't go any place else to do your academic stuff, no place else.  You couldn't come to Chicago State [University in Illinois], you couldn't go to Loyola, couldn't go to DePaul.  You had to go to the University of Chicago.  So, we have, hey you got, got, got the best there is, you know.  And so we couldn't find a job.  So man, so I finally got, got down to Southern University and you know and then the next thing you know you start talking to other people that's the only way that we got into that door was everybody kept saying you gotta have some experience, where as it would take our white counterparts from the Art Institute and let them in, experience or no experience, you know.  And so we went down there and I was saying to my friend, Keith Morrison.  Keith is a dynamite guy now 'cause he went on to Maryland, U of I [University of Illinois] and Maryland.  He's out at California now, top drawer.  Well anyway, Keith went to Fisk [University in Nashville, Tennessee] and with [HM] David Driskell down there at Fisk, you know.  So, he went to Fisk--
Speaker 1: --(Unclear)--The HistoryMakers--
Speaker 2: Right, top drawer.  So, he went to Fisk and I went to Southern University.  He came back within about a year or so, and I did the same thing.  Hey, Southern was, hey had its ups and its downs and it just wasn't--I don't know I knew I had a better shot in terms of my career as an artist and everything else in, in the north.  The apartment was absolutely positively A number one plus.  These guys were, I mean they were awesome artists, man, you know (laughter).  You know and it was Frank Hayden, you know people, guys like that, you know, I mean top drawer, man, doing art, art work for the Pope and folk like that.  I mean, come on now, you know, so--talent and everything was there, just it's, I mean, it's a love/hate, sometimes hate relationship with, with scholars, you know and artists sometimes at some of the black universities.  But at any rate, bottom line was I did a year there and from that I was able to come here and that was because the black students had rioted at the old campus on 68th Street.  They had rioted there and locked the administrators in and they were looking for warm black bodies who qualified, and I was one of the first ones who walked through the door and applied, and it got me, man.  It grabbed me, suck me up, man, didn't even want to look at my slides and everything else.  And the woman here was great who was the chairperson and she just grabbed me and say "Hey do your thing in terms of African American studies and African studies and I know you're strong in that and all this other kind of stuff; do your thing" and that's how--it just opened another world for me and everything else, you know, with, with this help from the Art Institute.  It was, hey it was just a whole other world, man.  So, I was just happy to be here and everything else and to do my thing and so there you go.
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: That was '69' [1969].  That was '69' [1969] and '71'[1971].  In '70' [1970], I went to--I was here for a year and I became the first, first scholar, if you can call me that, or whatever you wanna do, the first black, the first person, the first professor at Chicago State [University] to become a National Endowment for the Humanities fellow.  Nobody else had gotten one.
Story_ID: 72572
Speaker 1: So, I got that [an National Endowment for the Humanities fellowship] and then I was off to Africa, you know, doing my thing in terms of researching funeral art, trying to--
Speaker 2: Were you excited about going to Africa?
Speaker 1: Ooh God that was--I had gone to Heaven.  That was it.  That was totally it, man, and it was so much, it was enough money where I took my wife [Thelma Ford] and my son with me.  He was about that, so you know hey the money was good and every other thing, but I had reached--man that was Heaven, that was it, man, going-[HM] Margaret [Burroughs] had helped me.  Everybody had primed me and all this other kind of stuff, man, and that, that opened, that opened the door.  Man, the major door was open.
Speaker 2: What was your first glimpse of Africa like?  Can you remember the first time you ever--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: It was hot (laughter).  The first time we got in--
Speaker 2: --put your eyes on Africa?
Speaker 1: The first time we landed in Senegal man it was so daggone hot thought we were in an oven, man (laughter).  It was hotter--look I think it was, it was on par with New Orleans [Louisiana].  New Orleans is one hot place in the summertime, man it was like--it reminded me of New Orleans it was so hot.  But, anyway, it just became a love affair.  Man, it's just like--the smells and the colors and the sounds and everything else opened you up.  [HM] Margaret Burroughs had told me.  She gave me--I had phone numbers, names, addresses, and every other thing, you know, and other that we didn't know anybody.  And so I was visiting professor at various universities, you know, so that, they would be my base and I'd go out and study the funeral arts so when I see it in the Sea Islands or in Georgia, South Carolina, Mississippi, I, I could almost tell what ethnic group that they came from.  So, I can, you know I'm, that good at it now and everything else, you know.
Speaker 2: You know there was a time when I was told this in school by a professor who actually was on loan to my school from Central State.  He's a religion professor and he told us there are no African survivors amongst blacks in the United States; there are none.  He said if you think there are he said you're, you're crazy.
Speaker 1: Well I--
Speaker 2: And, and this, and, and I, you know, I, I tried to contradict him, but at the time I didn't have a lot of information, but I, I said well I know you're wrong, but, but did you, what did you find?
Speaker 1: Yeah, but, that had been that whole notion that people had been into that whole bag that said our, our culture had been destroyed, and that is not true, you know, and that is not true.  The language had, you know, the Gullah language and everything else.  That was proven, man, you know they didn't exist.  Wrote a text book on it, you know.  Broke it down and everything else.  Black scholars became proficient in it enough in the African language and know about how the Gullah got started, everything and they did survive because all--
Speaker 2: The Gullah and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: The Gullah, yeah the Sea Islands of Georgia and South Carolina, you know.
Speaker 2: Can, can you spell that for, for us?
Speaker 1: Gullah, G-U-L-L-A-H.
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah.
Speaker 1: And we used to call 'em Geechees when we were kids 'cause you know you couldn't understand 'em man.  They had a whole different thing, you know.  Said "Where you from?" --(unclear)--I know several 'cause I can't understand you know 'cause still that African dialect and stuff coming through 'cause they were isolated to a certain extent.  You know, so the whole thing was, and this was my whole point and I always kept to it and everything else, I said, "Hey our culture still exist and everything and you find it all the time.  Go back in the back country and everything else, man, it's like being--close your eyes, man, and you swear to God when you look at those graves and the markers they put on there you would swear you were in, in Ghana, Nigeria, or you were in the Congo, one of the two, exactly the same.  There are always modification 'cause we're never a stagnant people, and this is what makes it so interesting and really exciting.  It is not a dull drab thing because death is not death for the African as it is for us.  We got a whole different mindset and when you're dealing with death in Africa and dealing with the cemeteries you talking about living things because it's a spirit.  And see black folk here we try to, you know, get them to understand that man.  When you go visit in Africa and you go to a cemetery you are literally visiting a live entity, you hear what I'm saying, and if you don't have yourself straightened together you do not go 'cause it's the worst thing in the world to bring somebody who is not respected, who is not honorable.  That's like bringing, you know, that kind of person into your home.  You never ever do that.  So, it's a whole lot of stuff involved in it.  So, it's like a door--death can be a door to that African psyche, how we think, how we feel, and even in the United States.  I found that out through the years.  But, it, it was a fascinating, fascinating, fascinating 'cause hey we lived, we had a house and all that kind of stuff, you know.  We were on campus and I mean it was everything that you could ever ask for out of a trip.  We were there over a year, and it was--
Story_ID: 72573
Speaker 1: Did you spend most of it in the Senegal?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  Ghana, Nigeria, and the Congo.  And of course we were up in Ethiopia.  We were in Kenya and all that kind of stuff, you know.  But, it was, the whole experience was so broadening and, and it just, it just changed my whole life, you know period.  You know, so, that was, that was the opening.  So, here I come back to Chicago State [University in Illinois], man I'm rocking and ready and you know and pulling the students and doing all this other kind of stuff and turning 'em on, which I did, but I, I think I was almost starving, you know around here because who can you get.  You know you talk to a lot of the guys around here, you know, and sometimes they come and "Mr. Ford you know all about this stuff, man, and you know I teach a little about Africa and everything and I never been there and I don't know I'm just teaching it from the text book and all that kind of stuff."  You know, we can't hold a conversation, you know, what can we talk about, you know, he's, he's almost an idiot, you know.  And so this is how I think that what happened with me going over to Inner City Studies and just by a fluke I just took a little part-time job and it happen to be that the school sent me over to Northeastern [Northeastern Illinois University Center for Inner City Studies in Chicago, Illinois] and they said, "They got a little opening there won't you go over there and teach 'cause you a specialist in African and African American art and nobody has one."  So, I was, you know, I was, I was a commodity, man, you know, and so from there, from Northeastern, north campus they sent me, 'cause I was, I'm into the African thing all the way, they sent me to Inner City Studies--(unclear)--you'll find some folk there who really in, course he did me a favor.
Speaker 1: Now, now when was that?
Speaker 2: That was, ooh, that was in seventy, '77' [1977] or '78' [1978] one of the two and, and from there that was the next big huge door to open in my life period, hands down.
Story_ID: 72574
Speaker 1: This is Northeastern [Northeastern Illinois University Center for Inner City Studies in Chicago, Illinois] --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Inner City Studies.
Speaker 1: --Center for Inner Studies.
Speaker 2: And Center for Inner Studies.  So all the heavies were there, you know.  Anderson Thompson, [HM Jacob H.] Jake Carruthers, you know, [HM] Conrad [Walter] Worrill, you know, Starks.  I mean you name it, man, they had--it was all-star lineup, you know.  What's my man from South Africa--
Speaker 1: Satolli.
Speaker 2: Satolli, man, I mean God, you know and I had met Satolli early and everything else and he just blowed me away, man.  He and I hit it off just like this 'cause Satolli had blown away some white scholars at a conference and so he and it hit it off, you know.  And, so--at any rate I was--and I came there and they welcomed me with open arms.  Man, they really--and they were talking about pour libation and pour li, I mean it was that African spirit from the inside.  I mean, you gotta know what you're talking about and everything and these, these guys were into it, man, and I just, I told my wife [Thelma Ford] I said they don't have to pay me I just go over there and teach the course for nothing, you know, 'cause, you know  Andy's down the hall, Jake is here.  So, sometimes I'd let my class out early or either we take our breaks so I could listen in on Jake's class.  Man, you got these giants, man and, and Jake is, you know, he's a giant's giant, you know and I'm look man said talking about in Heaven, I'm past Heaven now, you know 'cause I'm around and, and this they just totally influenced my life totally and everybody else and it has never been the same since.  I think, you know, I'm just thankful to the career that has happened this way, you know, and, and Jake just said, "Man you gotta come on"--and see he has been that type of personality, the type of spiritual personality that when I'm around him he opens my mind.  Like if I have, if I'm working on something and I'm kind of stuck on it I get around Jake he has those kind of, that kind of energy and like it opens my mind up and solving.  The very first piece that I did for, for the center do it for free, you know.  I got the studio, I got the energy, and I got every other thing, you know, and, and that's that African thing coming back again.  You know, Center didn't have any money.  I gon' do it for free, you know, I'm gon' give it to you guys.  Everybody look at me and say you sure you, you right, you know, you just gon' give away something.  I said I'm blessed, you know, I got the studio, I got the ability, I know how to work all of these materials, and I, I just wanted, I just wanted to see what's on the inside.
Story_ID: 72575
Speaker 1: And you are known for these public works of art in black institutions.  I think more than anyone else in the city [Chicago, Illinois] right now you're known for these major installations in the black institutions from Chicago State [University in Illinois], you know mostly black schools, basically is a state school and it's mostly black.  Northeastern's Center for Inner City Studies [Northeastern Illinois University], the--(unclear)--, you go the Tree of Life here in Chicago State.  You got--
Speaker 2: eta Theater [eta Creative Arts Foundation].
Speaker 1: eta Theater in the lobby there.  That's the first thing you see when you go in the eta Theater, your work.  I mean, how do you, is that, I mean is that kind of work more important to you than exhibiting and, and--
Speaker 2: I try to play one off on the other, you know.  Sometime, you know, you--sometimes it just gets into you that you, I want something, do something big.  And if somebody comes to me 'gon, you 'gon give me some money, you know, and commission me to do something, then I'll go on and do it.  --(Unclear)--commissioned me to do work.  I've done big old huge plaque for them, you know, and all that kind of stuff.  So, I, I've, you know, its, it depends upon the time.  The artist need to eat.  You gotta have money like everybody else you know, but all of it pays off one way or the other.  I grow by doing and everything else and for the very, very first piece that I gave I had talked to Jake and everything else.  Man, I had worked on part of it.  I said, "What am I gonna do with the rest of it."  Shoot, man, I started talking to [HM Jacob H.] Jake Carruthers and that, that started that whole spiritual thing with him and then it seem like my mind just opened up and I knew how to solve the whole thing, Larry, the whole thing, and I solved it right in there.  We were talking and Jake said "What you gon' do?"  I said, "I got it already Jake, solved the whole thing."  And then from then on it just took off and so when I talked with him and I always try if I do something for Inner City Studies or something like that I always try and get him to come over.  You know, if not Jake and if he's tied up or something like that I get Yvonne [R. Jones, Director of the Kemetic Institute], one of the two, you know.  And they-it's, it's like the, it's the old African way.  The priest has to come in, has to sanction it and everything else, and you get that spiritual energy of running through and these are the things that you learn in Africa from being there and doing.  And they a part of it and this is why I'm so happy that we in sync.  Does it make sense in what I'm saying to you?  We in sync and that whole spiritual thing and, and Jake has always said, you know, said "The more you learn the more, the strong you gon' get" and every other thing, and there you go.  You know, so I got a sabbatical I went there, I mean, it's just one great thing after the other and that man is just, you know, and, it has inspired me in terms of more scholarship, to read more, to learn more, and everything else.  And you now when you're around people like the giants, living walking giants and I always tell my students I say "Hey these are folk you gotta go and touch 'em and say hey man I, I done, I've touched one of the great individuals in this, you know, in this country and in the nation, man.  I said go up and say something to him.  Get his autograph or something like that.  He is that outstanding."  [Anderson] Andy Thompson the same way, so when you, when I interact with them--and I keep telling people "a lot of time when you, when you around folk those people who up there on that level that energy feel is feeding and everything else and you, you're feeling and pulling in off of that energy and everything else" and man I go back and do great things.  Man, I just, I'm just turned on, you know, and this is, and it has shown in my work, you know all of it is just, just, I mean it's just, just taken off and everything else, you know, and so every now and then I say hey it's time for me to do a big piece for, you know, for them or something like that.  But, hey I give because that's the African way.  They ain't got any money, you know, so I give it out.  I do it until sometimes it takes me six months.  You know, that six months that I could have been working on something else, you know, but that's the way life goes it's a trade off.
Story_ID: 72576
Speaker 1: Said "sometimes you work like AFRI-COBRA," you know, and stuff like that.  You know, which is an honor, I mean, that's hey, that's, that's saying something.  You know, but we all went to school together and that, those influences and looking at one another's work.  Artists always look at other artists work, shoot that how you grow and everything.
Speaker 2: We were rolling in the middle of this, but you were talking about AFRI-COBRA, which is a black arts collective group that do public art--(unclear)--City of Chicago, and you were saying that you knew a lot of those fellows--(unclear)--later who was a member of NCA [National Conference of Artists]--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Right, right.  NCA got me started, of course, you know in Brazil and everything else, but the AFRI-COBRA is so strong, you know, they are the integral part in turn, 'cause they're so important in the city.  We should have written a book about this.  And we keep saying this over and over and [HM] Margaret [Burroughs] said that all of us who got all this knowledge and everything why isn't there a book about that, the arts, the arts in terms of Chicago [Illinois] and everything.  It should have been--you know we--Chicago has fed New York [New York City, New York] and Los Angeles [California] so many times it's a shame, man.  So many great artists came out here, you know, and went to New York and did their thing, but they were educated and trained here, and we needed to do it, so in my class I always, the AFRI-COBRA I give an exam on them in a minute.  You know, people got to know 'cause I think they're that important.  The same with Dr. Burroughs and the south side community art center, other groups, and other people who have come along and everything else, you know.
Story_ID: 72577
Speaker 1: Okay, and so your, it's in, you're in the late '70's [1970s] now at the [Northeastern Illinois University] Center for Inner City Studies [in Chicago, Illinois] you're excited about what you're being exposed to, this, the, the cultural organization has been informed that the Center for Inner City Studies were you are part of those, I mean during that time I know that [HM] Dr. [Jacob H.] Carruthers formed the Kemetic Institute--
Speaker 2: So, I'm a member of the Kemetic Institute and ASCAC [The Association for the Study of Classical African Civilizations] everything else, and they pulled me into that.  So, I kind of standing on the side line and that's the great part of it, you know, you know.  [HM] Conrad [Walter Worrill] said "Man come on in and want you to be this, and, and a workshop.  I want you to do this and do that and everything" and I said, "Man they ain't my, you know, you guys are the sure enough scholars," you know and "That's alright, you know, you a scholar," you know, and all that.  And, that's how they pulled me into that.  Hey, man and I've just loved every minute of it and everything.  You know, so I'm, I'm, you know, I'm a member, you know, and, and I, I just love it 'cause it just feeds, feeds and feeds.  You know, when I stand in front of my class or in front of anybody I can rap with the best of 'em, you know, and, and the students know this and this is why my classes are always, my African and African classes, man, they're always jammed pack and I have a great reputation on campus, man, and I know it.  They call my class and they write and didn't say anything to them about it.  They have a nickname for my class.
Speaker 1: What is it?
Speaker 2: They call it the "class of life."
Speaker 1: Oh really.
Speaker 2: Every--when they write down their evaluations in class by and large somebody gon' write down there "This is not just African art, this is the class of life."  And I never said anything to anybody like that.  It's just over and over and over you get that, so it's kind of got that name, so, the class is a jam because I'm giving them what Jake and them have taught me and what I know.  I mean, all of this stuff coming together, Larry, and coming together and, when I give it out in class and everything else I work the hell of 'em.  I kick butt going and coming; they like it.  You seem 'em change their clothes and their manners.  Got some, saw my students over with, you know, in Jakes class and Andy's [Thompson] class now, you know, so that's the great thing that I feel and that I like so much and I know you don't want to hear this right now I may be a head of you, Larry, is that what I like about at a black institution, you know, like, you know, we could have been at DePaul [University in Chicago, Illinois] and all those places.  I was offered a job.  DePaul would have hired, hired me over the phone, man, you know, but I'm here at Chicago State [University in Illinois] and these students need what I am giving them and that's the great thing too, you know, because I'm giving and telling them about life, the problems that we have, the religion, the philosophy, and I can go from, from Egypt or Kemet all the way down to the Congo to South Africa, you know, hey I read the stuff, you know and look who I run with, Jake and all the rest.  I try and keep up with 'em as best I can, you know, but I, I been enriched and I've grown and I'm pass that stuff on to the students, and they love it, man, they love it.
Story_ID: 72578
Speaker 1: Yeah it's an interesting thing about the way you speak of your, your work and your experiences you--many artists talk about their vision on something and what they're creating and you, of course, you, your work is unique, their yours on a level, but you, you always speak about in, in a collective way like you're part of something bigger, I mean, you know, you, you've done more talking about the influences of other on your than you have about what you, your own, you know--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: It's, it's that--I, I think it's that African thing, man you know it's that, the collective is as so, so very important, you know, and matter fact it was like the first piece that I did for Inner City Studies [Northeastern Illinois University Center for Inner City Studies in Chicago] I had one name on it, and they renamed it.  I, I didn't get upset 'cause hey shoot does it work.  Fine, that's probably the way it was meant to be.  Sometime it has two names.  I said I could care less, but it's, it's the feedback, the input from other folk, which is so important, and this is a problem that we have so much in Western culture and Western art.  You know, everything is "I" and, and I keep drumming it and drumming it, and drumming it into those student's heads and everything else.  The whole thing is the community, the collective us and Africa.  That's why we in trouble now.  That's why the continent's in trouble 'cause people doing all these crazy things, and it's all about I and forgetting about everybody else and its un-African.  And it's not gon' straighten out, and we're not gonna get the continent straightened out until we get our whole thing and get back on like Jake [HM Jacob H. Carruthers] said, "We get back to fundamentals."  And when we get back to fundamentals, things are going to straighten out and things can happen.  And I just keep saying this is part, this is why we have problems.  You just don't have to look at Africa, you can just look here in the United States and see part of our problem here.  We don't own nothing.  We don't want to do anything.  We just falling apart.  We got more money.  We got more, we got better jobs and everything else, and we are worse off than we ever were.  I said we let the family fall apart and once you let that family fall apart and the collectiveness in terms of the community fall apart you got deep troubles.  I said and real deep, and I started giving examples, and they say "Hey Ford I agree with you.  You right there and everything else."  And this is the whole thing that we gotta understanding.  I said, "Look we went through slavery.  We went through the middle passage and went through slavery, and we didn't fall apart.  Look at us now,"  I said, "just look at us now."  We in pathetic shape, and you know when, when you deal with Jake and the rest of 'em you got statistics.  You can, you can drop all that stuff off and that's what Andy [Anderson Thompson] does, you know man Andy drop all that stuff off, he say hey get an understanding.  This is time to talk, the right talk and get ourselves together as a people, whereas we are not used by every ethnic group that comes along and this is our problem.  Everybody has used us, and that's why the continent is in that shape.  Everybody wants something from us without paying.  I said and that's why we're in that shape, you know, and, and then their eyes get bigger and the next thing you know they reading the African books, they getting into it and everything else and wanna hold a conversation and then the spiritual stuff comes up and all this other kind of jazz, which makes it interesting, you know, and so you making people, you making real human beings out of real African people.  And this is what I love about teaching here is that I can, I can touch somebody, you know.
Story_ID: 72579
Speaker 1: Okay, now I know you had two, you had three, well you had a profound ex, experience in African with humanities fellowship [National Endowment for the Humanities fellowship] and I know you went, in 1987 you went to--was that your first trip to Egypt?
Speaker 2: Yeah that was my first trip.
Speaker 1: Yeah, tell us about that and I know that was--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) They say, "Can you find words for it? Can you be descriptive of it?"  You just can't.  It's just, it's just--you feel like this and you feel like an ant with the colossal pieces and art work and how well it's done and, you know, and then the more you study it and everything else you just--I am always at this, this the juncture and I know people don't like to hear me say "You really wanna get down on your knees in front of those art pieces" because it, it, it inspires so much, you know, its, it has so much spiritualism.  It's done so fantastically well and everything else.  So, when you run into a person who is a master's master you have to give him respect.  And the African way is you get on you--in Brazil in other places we call it "thrown down."  You know throw down means you flatten all the way out (laughter) and everything else.  You wanna get on your knees in front of those pieces because they're just that great.  And this is what, it just turned me on as an artist, man, and it's, it's a never, it's unending because the more you study, the more there is.  Perfection and beauty and you know it's, it's--I, I don't know it's just--I don't have all the words for it.
Story_ID: 71329
Speaker 1: We were talking about your trip to Egypt in '87' [1987] with the Association for the Study of Classical African Civilizations [ASCAC] and the impact that trip had on you.
Speaker 2: It was, it was just so unbelievable, and I had Andy [Anderson Thompson] and Dr. Thompson, and Yvonne Jones were our guides and of course we had, you know, the Egyptians had other guides there and it was just, just open as another world.  It just opened my mind, man.
Speaker 1: Where did you go in Egypt?
Speaker 2: Oh, we went Karnak.  We went across to the, across the West Bank, and you know to Hatshepsut, and we went all around, and went to all the major temples and everything else.  I mean, we, we hit all the big spots and you know what was so nice too is that one of the fellows with us had, had a camera and he filmed and we got a chance to see, you know, and did a good job in a lot of the large tombs and everything else and that, I think that was great.  And then of course Andy took us down to--and Andy said that's always, you know, just super important we went down to Aswan.  And then, you know, with you know with the Aswan brothers and the Nubian brothers and everything else and then we had to, it was a town they had adopted and we all bought notebook paper and school paper in all, you know the whole business--everything that they asked us to bring, everything that they wanted us to bring--they, they told us what to bring, you know, Band-Aids, you know and all this stuff that they wanted, not what we wanted to give 'em and everything and that was very, very moving.  It was very, very important.  We in contact with the people, not there just as you know, quote, you know "visitors" looking at the--(unclear)--and we're interacting with the people and everything and it was, it was totally something else, you know.
Speaker 1: Did you have any--in terms of that kind of personal contact, did you have a chance to really go into the homes of people--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --is there any, any particular rich memory of that, that you can?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and, and one of, one of the times, you know, we went, stopped off at some of the villages and everything else and we talked to the people and they came back to the hotel.  Then, we had a lot of strong interaction then and everything and that was very, very moving, man, 'cause they were after a little help.  And so what we did was we went in our suitcases and took some of the stuff that we had for our village that we had adopted, that Andy and them had adopted, and we split it up and gave it to them.  And, and, Larry, it was very, very, very moving because they had been uprooted from a lot of their homes because of the flooding of the dam and everything.
Speaker 1: This is in Nubia, correct?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and it was interesting 'cause we got to meet some of, you know, the chiefs and everything else man and, and to have a chief bow to you, hey that don't happen; that's the opposite way around, you know what I mean, and they were up against it.  And we, our hearts went out because they were uprooted and they were having problems and they did them like they do the Native Americans here move you and the hell with it, you know, tough stuff, you know, and that was a part of the problem.  So, we had some strong identification things going on with them.  And then we had the Nubian wedding we went to, and that was interesting also.  We were the guests of honor, and we had on our, what do you call it the long gown and--I'm trying to think, on the tip of my tongue, but anyway--
Speaker 1: Jellabiya.
Speaker 2: Jellabiya.  We had the Jellabiya on and everything and so we had a--we were the guest of honor and everything else.  It was very, very interesting.  Very, very interesting.  I mean, those kind of things that it's not just you go to a wedding and everything else and you know you got a chance to interact and sit around and talk with them.  Most of them, a lot of them speak English, you know, and, and I think one of the interesting things and you find this all over, all over West Africa and in the Congo a lot of times, sometimes they look at you and keep staring at you and say that you are one of the relatives who is returning and everything else.  Interesting, happens often, often, often.  'Cause I had, a lot of times they said I had that spiritual energy and I identify a lot with folk and everything.  They kind of tend to kind of adopt me and you know make me their son and everything else.  But, people looking at you and they, they start laughing.  And you say, "I wonder what they laughing at, what are they saying, and what's going on and everything else.  That's so and so, and so and so."  "Man, they pointed you out, you one of the relatives that has returned."  'Cause you know that reincarnation thing, you know, woe, interesting.  I won't go into all that, Larry, but it's some, some interesting stuff.  We don't wanna be here the rest of the night and everything, but some interesting stuff.  So on that, on that line it was, it was, it was just a great, great, great trip.
Story_ID: 71330
Speaker 1: Okay, you even went back again a year after on sabbatical.
Speaker 2: Right and so I got a bunch of money from the university [Chicago State University in Illinois] and I got a lot of the equipment, camera equipment, film, and all that kind of stuff just loaded down.  And my wife [Thelma Ford] went with me and Andy [Anderson Thompson] helped me.  Andy, Jake [HM Dr. Jacob H. Carruthers], everybody helped, man, it was just, just a family thing.  So, they planned out my whole day.  So, we were there, what was it, four months, I think it was, four months.  And so we went from one end to the other, man.  It was, it was, it was just awesome, and so I had enough--what was so interesting about that I had enough film.  I filmed enough places and did enough work that it's enough for about two or three people.  If I ever get a grant (and I have to apply for it, I'm so busy doing other things), it's enough work for two or three people for over a year.  It's that much stuff, I mean, just bins of slides, I mean, good stuff you know.  No garbage, you know.  And so one of these days we'll do that, so you know we help with research and everything else for people who need it.  So, that, that was a great, great, great, great, great trip.
Story_ID: 71331
Speaker 1: Now how did that trip [his second trip to Africa in 1988] influence your art?  Now, your, let's talk about your art.  You're a sculptor and what are your favorite materials?  What materials do you use?
Speaker 2: I--it, it-like I said it depends.  You know I like the bronze.  I like all the--I like the bronze. I like the plexiglass, and I like what we call the mixed media.  And I use that extensively.  You know any kind, kind of cloth or, you know any kind of fabric, whatever.  You know, I, I use all of that and I guess I have developed a way of putting things together and everything else, and it, it just, I don't know I'm, I'm restless while I'm there 'cause it's so much, you now, the feeding into the brain and everything else and plus the spiritual, of course, is, it's an attachment.  So, it just helps me--I just come back with tons of ideas and directions that I wanna go.
Story_ID: 71332
Speaker 1: Now, we're in a unique position today to do something unusual that we don't do.  We've got two pieces directly behind you that are on camera and I think we might even be able to focus on them, and, and perhaps you can tell us about those.  Because you're an artist, you know it's hard to talk about art without looking at it, but, you know, and the ideas that go into the art work.  So, maybe if we can maybe talk about the piece to your left over your left shoulder.
Speaker 2: And that's Oshun 'cause that's from, that's from the Bra, Brazilian thing 'cause I recall it and that's after Dr. Anderson Thompson.  You know he coined the phrase the African-Brazilian Connection.  And I've gone to Brazil doing stuff and I've become very, very influenced by that also and they work together.  And that is we call an Orisha called Oshun, and Orishas are aspects of nature, and they're saints really.  And Oshun was, was the Oshun River, and she was very, very, very, very powerful, very, very beautiful.  She had curative properties and everything else and so that's a sculpture.  So, they have colors.  Each Orisha has colors, foods, and everything else that relates directly to them.  And they come out, and they, they come out dancing, they come out dancing and this is what she's in a move position of moving forward because she's in a position of dancing, and dancing brings in the spirit entity of that, of that particular Orisha and other Orishas, and this is how the ceremony really starts and everything else.  So, and you will see orange and with her being the Orisha in terms of the Oshun River, and I was at the Oshun River when I was in Africa and everything.  Matter of fact I used to hang around all the time, you know.  A beautiful town, Osogbo [Nigeria], but at any rate this is where she's from, so she was very beautiful, and she was also vain.  She was, she loved to look at herself and everything else.  So, a lot of times she has a mirror, and you'll see that in the hand.  And so she was very, very important and very, very powerful.  She has the beads in front of her face.  It's called a veil of beads and only those who are associated with and those who are associated with royalty have the right to wear the veil of beads in front of the face.  Literally what it does is protects the, the viewer from what we call the spiritual energy of the person or the ashe.  That a king's ashe is so powerful that it would harm the average person.  So, they have the beads in front of the face to protect you from seeing his face.  And so, therefore, if this Orisha is associated with in any way with royalty and everything else then therefore you will see the beads in front of the face.  So, that's the one over there and so you can see she's got her mirror in her hand, and, and she's ready for action.
Speaker 1: Okay, now there's one too over your right shoulder.  Maybe you could describe that one for us?
Speaker 2: I forgot which one is that.
Speaker 1: OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE:  You can look.
Speaker 2: I can look, okay, shoot all right, shoot.  Oh, you know what that one is that's Oshun also.  The, the, the wall piece and Oshun is, and let me mention this, Oshun is one of my Orishas.  I'm very, very involved in it and everything else.  And your Orisha is on your head.  And Oshun is, she's not the number one Orisha, but she is one of my Orishas.  So, therefore, it is only normal that you would do one of your Orishas and so she's the Orisha of love, curative powers, the water, which water is always important and etc.  So, this is what's happen, so I've used plexiglass on her and you can notice the veil of beads coming in front of the face and everything else with the gold mask, so orange, gold are her colors and everything else.  And if you look real close you can see the fish on the, on her dress, and her dress is shaped almost bell shaped and that's a symbol.  Everything in Africa means something.  So, that's symbol in terms of the first mound of the world, where the first, the first mound of earth began.  The world was surrounded with water, and what was out was this mound of earth and so therefore the skirts symbolize this mound of earth and therefore you get that kind of bell like shape and everything else.  So, that's what she has.  So, everything on there, you know, researching down to, you know, very much and I do the Brazilian thing the same way as I do the Kemetic thing is.  I'm always in touch with the priests, so when they come in town from Brazil they come in and look and you know give me a yeah or nah on it and everything else and matter of fact they, you know, gave me a, you know, go ahead on all the stuff that I've done.  You know, they read the shelves and they tell you whether you can go on and do the work or not.
Story_ID: 71333
Speaker 1: Now, both of these works are mixed media with a variety of different materials being employed, you know, to create the affect and most of the work that I've seen is mixed media.
Speaker 2: And I love it--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --Africans were so great at it.  Look how we influenced [Pablo] Picasso, blew him away, you know, through a painting and all of a sudden they do a fake nail and then somewhere over here they do a real nail.  They opened the whole field, and this was-ours, this was the African thing.  They opened the whole field and later on we start to calling a collage and montage--(unclear)--, but Africans were the ones who did it, you know, and this was so great.  Now, we can kind of take it, we take it for granted and everything else, you know.  In Europe when they did, the ballet, a young lady in ballet position and with her tutu on and everything else.  In the old days, they did the whole thing out of bronze, the tutu and everything else when they started seeing, when Picasso and them started seeing Africans and everything else, what did they do, they put the real tutu around the, around the bronze work and everything else.  So, we've opened the world's eyes and so I'm still working in that thing and I feel so, it's, it's just a part of me.  I just like it and everything else.  And I like bronze because it's as close to gold, gold, and you know the symbolism in terms of gold, richness, you know, excellence, the creative energy and force of the universe and all that.  So, I like to use it and I like to, I like to sand it so (I call it "Florentining" it, and I like to sand it so that it reflects the light, so everything is dancing.  And this is the way that I see it, especially 'cause I'm, I'm great, I'm great in terms of dreams and in visions, and stuff like that.  And when I see that world or I go into that world and everything it is always really, really, really bright and alive.  The colors here in this, you know, in this consciousness is they're so drab and everything else, but that, they always, the colors are super bright, super strong, super alive.  And I try in everything that I do to, to give out that feeling and everything, and it's the same way as you hit Africa.  You know, the first thing time you get off the plane you wanna get your sunglasses and get all, you know, all that 'cause the light is bright and it's alive.  It's not filtered and stuff as we have it here, so I'm always trying to get that reflective quality where everything is jumping and it's dancing and that's that symbol, that, that energy from the creator and everything.  So, that's why I like to use it, and the plexiglass is because it gives that, again it gives you that sheen and, and it's contemporary, but yet it, it, it's doing something else for you.  So, I just continue on with it and I, of course use all kind of variations and everything else, but I find it very, very interesting and so much, and, and so alive, you know.
Story_ID: 71334
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now most of the works you describe are works inspired by your trips to Brazil and maybe by some trips to West Africa as well, you know with your Orishas and--(unclear)--.  Now when did you first go to Brazil?  Can you tell me about that experience?
Speaker 2: We went, when was that '85' [1985] or was that eighty--I think it was eighty fa--I'm trying to think it was '85' [1985] or '87' [1987] when we first went to Brazil.  NCA went and a bunch of artists and everything else and--
Speaker 1: --(Unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, sponsored it.
Speaker 1: --for those who are looking at this--
Speaker 2: National Conference of Artists, it's a black organization.  It's a national one and--
Speaker 1: It was founded by?
Speaker 2: [HM] Margaret Burroughs (laugher).  She was one of them.  Margaret and a whole bunch of, you know--I think [HM] David [Driskell] was in.  We was back there in the back--a whole bunch of, I mean some, some--
Speaker 1: The memberships are all the black artists that are prominent in these universities and cultural institutions--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right, and they come together and we--and they wanted to have--we have a conference and everything else and the con, this time the conference was supposed to meet in Brazil.  We were supposed to have a show, an exhibit, a joint exhibit with the Brazilian artists.  Larry, oh, oh, these guys were bad.  Woo, I mean, you know you say wow where have you guys like they were on another planet they was so, I mean, outstanding with color.  It was alive, different ways of saying and doing everything.  We were, we were just blown away, and so the exhibit was great.  The joint exhibit was great and they loved us and we loved them, and it became a love affair.  So, Ramon Price and I have been, you know, back and forth all the time.  So, we made connection and also Dr. [Anderson] Andy Thompson.  So, all of us got connections there and we'd go and it, it's, it's like Africa and that's the great thing that I want to emphasize because they kept their African culture.  When they brought 'em over and everything else, they hid their what we call Orishas or their gods behind the, the, the Catholic saints and so it became very, very easy to do.  So, when they said that they are worshiping or honoring a Catholic saint, it's actually an African saint.  So, they held on to it and it's like being in Africa.  You know, if you know about the Orisha like going to Nigeria.  You know, you, you know the colors, you know the forms and the shapes and everything it's like a code and when you understand that code it's as clear as it can be, and the influence--
Speaker 1: Now, the Yorubas are originally from--
Speaker 2: Actually and this is where we get the connection come in.  Actually Yorubas, all of them state that they, they really migrated from what we call lower Nubia and all that area around in there.
Speaker 1: All the way in the West Indies.
Speaker 2: Yeah, all the way there because, and it's always been their tradition.  They always said that they migrated.  Matter a fact one time I had, I had the grandson of the only Ile-Ife in my class.  Man, he gave--I just turned him loose and said you know, "Just gon' and talk" and every other thing.  He gave a blow by blow description in terms of the migration from what we call lower Egypt or around that area, Nubia, Sudan area, around that area, all the way over the West Africa.  Blow--telling everything that happened along the way.  It was awesome, awesome.  So, that tradition and they can tell you about that tradition and which place they came to when they first migrated into Nigeria, because these cities that they first occupied, these large settlements became the holy cities because seniority is very important.  Like for instance, Ife.  Ife is a holy city and was supposed to have migrated there first, although they migrated to other places.  Supposedly Ife was the very first one, so that's the holy city.
Story_ID: 71335
Speaker 1: Okay now do you think, I mean, I mean, you've been to Egypt and you, you been to Nubia, and you've been to Yorubaland in Nigeria and, and to Brazil where Yoruba tradition is still going on.  Is there a connection, you think between the aspects of life called--(unclear)--Egypt and the Orishas?
Speaker 2: Yes it is.  I mean, just like all they did is change a little bit, you know, you know, you know when we call Isis.  You know Isis becomes Yemonja, you know the mother, the mother.  So, she sits on a throne in, in Kemet and, and in Brazil 'cause she's called Yemonja Brazil she became "the mother" because of the middle passage.  And she became even more important there in Brazil than probably in Nigeria, but she still became that, that, that, the title, "the mother," and the same is what we call Isis.  So she--Isis sits on the throne and Yemonja is the mother of all.  She's the mother of the ocean because they--and again the whole thing is running through because they said that when they were doing the middle passage and everything else they thought that maybe the gods had abandoned them and that this was their darkest moment and every other thing and they said they looked out on the water and you could see the porpoises and mother fish jumping out, and they said no that you know that our gods have not, have not abandoned us and you see there that's a symbol and sign.  So, always now you see with the Yemonja you see almost like a mermaid in Brazil.  The fish big time, big time, big time there.  And so she is literally "the mother" because of the deep knowledge, the depth in terms of the sea.  Olokun is big in Nigeria.  Olokun is supposed to be, is the dark, the farther or lower part of the ocean, the knowledge and everything else.  She is the top part of the ocean, so therefore we still got the mother thing going all the way through, and the same where as all the other natures and everything else.  You know you get them going always.  It's like exchanging one name for the other.  They still are a mother are of the, of, of nature and that's the thing.
Speaker 1: Do you think it's important for young artists today to, to learn how these--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I think so.  I always tell my students, you know, "Know what you're doing.  Even if you're gonna break the rules at least know 'em," you know, and every other thing.  Nobody is gonna stand over your with a stick and beat you on the head if, if you do it, I said but it is incumbent upon you because it's your culture.  Your ancestors came from the culture and everything you should know.  There is no excuse.  Even if you break the rules and everything, you should break 'em with some knowledge and have some respect and you should always honor them and respect them even before you start to work.  I said, "These are the things that hold us together.  They are part of our culture, and we have to continue to do the same thing."  I would not dream of, and I kind of got them in that mood in terms of it.  You know, I said do a little saying--for instance I got popcorn back there on a plate and I'm working on with one of the Orishas called Omolu.  Omolu in Nigeria is a smallpox and then turn into a curative thing of AIDS and everything.  It's fighting disease after awhile, okay.  One time it's giving out, next time it's fighting and everything else and curing.  Okay, Omolu likes popcorn and so I give, I have to give out--and so when you eat the food that is the favorite of the Orisha, when you eat the food you ingesting some of that spiritual element and quality of that Orisha.  We did the same thing when they brought us here to this country.  The food their calling in, the food is, is like a code name.  The African foods that we brought were favorite foods of our gods and everything.  We brought it here to us, with us to the United States.  So, when whites were eating it they were eating part of our, part of our saints, you see what I'm saying.
Speaker 1: Really soul food--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Soul food, there you go right on the head, right on the head and everything else.
Speaker 1: And matter fact, and there were a lot of time, I remember the first beginning, you know, back in the early '70's [1970s] and if you said something like this, you know, people say, "Ah Ford you crazy, you know that stuff ain't true."  White scholars came out and said the same thing.  [Robert Farris] Thompson at Yale [University in New Haven, Connecticut], all these other guys they come and put the stamp of approval on it and then people gonna believe 'cause a white scholar said it.  So, there you go, Larry, it's one of those kind of things.  But, again the connection is there, and we have done enough interesting homework and so I always pass out stuff.  You know I pass out, you know, "Hey this is, this is the African saint.  This is the European saint.  This is how they equate.  This is the food they eat.  These are the days that they honor it."  All this other kind--all the way across.  My students have to know it.
Story_ID: 71336
Speaker 1: This is so rich.  I wanna change gears for one second.  I think, I don't wanna leave out the activist side of what you've been involved in, 'cause I know you're an activist as well as an artist and you're an artist/activist and in this sense I know you're involved in two things that I know about that were very important.  One was the creation of the African American [Visual] Artists Roundtable and the other one was the roundtable's challenge of the city's [Chicago, Illinois] big art show, which put you on the cover of Newcity and some others, now you were written about in the [Chicago] Reader and other publications--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Paid the price for that too (laughter).
Speaker 1: --that.  Can, can you discuss first the roundtable and then the, the struggle around the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: The whole thing in which artists are trying to do now, which we had done and we've always said early before artists on the North Side tend to get together and they organize, they understand how this art world work.  They understand the mechanism and every other thing. They get the lawyers.  They get everybody else and they hold together as a group, so therefore they get the lion's share of the money.  All the goods that are to be had in this artistic world they know how to get 'em.  They know how to press the right buttons.  We on the south side have done almost just the opposite.  Instead of being advocates for and every other thing we done just, you know, hey we want to sell some art work, but it's more than that.  You gotta be involved in it.  You gotta stand up and fight for it.  You gotta go to meetings that nobody wants to go to, and all that.  We have to be like they are if we are gonna survive, and that's what the roundtable got started 'cause [Chicago Mayor] Harold Washington was the mayor then and Harold told us up front, you know, Harold said, "Man you guys got, won't you guys get together.  Man sitting up there in the office and you guys sitting down and the white artists over there getting all of, all of--they got the whole meal.  We don't even have a crumb.  See those guy got it all.  Won't you guys get together, and that's what started us together.  It's too bad we didn't hold together and everything. 'Cause I ran out of energy.  I tried to be an administrator and an artist and you can't do them, you can't do both of them.  One of these days, we'll get back together, but we did some great things and that was good, and but again it, it can, more things can be done, but we gotta do the whole package.
Story_ID: 71337
Speaker 1: For example, what--give me an example of the kind of thing that you'll [the African American Visual Artists Roundtable] do 'cause I know about the hotel.
Speaker 2: Yeah we go the hotel thing.  Then we would--we, we go to meetings and man, we, we battled, you know, we, I mean, when people doing you wrong, you know, they had the big--you know sometimes they would have exhibits and man would exclude us and you know we gon' stand up there? Look, now you got an arm to battle and state claims that need to be stated.  Before that, you know, we didn't have that staff and so when you do that then people will think twice before they do these crazy things.
Speaker 1: Briefly, can you describe what happened at the hotel?
Speaker 2: The hotel happened basically was they had said that--they were renovating the hotel and they needed art work and everything else and it was open to the community.  It was not open to the community.  It was a done deal.  Mat, matter of fact it was so open to the community that they got their artists from, of all things, California, 18th Street gallery in California, now that's open all right.  So, we found out about it, we read in the paper and then we applied and we fought them and we got the Urban League on our side and I'll be more about the Urban League, but at any rate, the Urban League helped us, tried to--they educated us, and we became sophisticated enough and every other thing and we battled them, made a presentation and everything else, and we jumped over the--.  This is I think is one of the nails in the coffin, the gallery's control.  Owners go to the, to the galleries, the galleries got their, their artists and they, they parcel it out like that.  So here we are asking the hotel don't go to the galleries, you go directly to us.  So, that's the way the rub comes in, you know, and, and you know a lot of folk were awfully made about that deal.  So, they dealt directly with us and so we had to become much more organized.  I think got a, almost have a B.A. in business now, you know.   I had to learn so much, you know.
Speaker 1: So, you all got commissions--(simultaneous)--artwork for the--
Speaker 2: We got commissions for artwork throughout the entire hotel.
Speaker 1: Which hotel chain was this?
Speaker 2: That was Hilton Hotel, downtown [Chicago, Illinois].  We did a schematic.  We did a study of the whole place where art should go, what kind of flow it could.  They didn't think we had those kind of brains, and so we outsmarted 'em and they--
Speaker 1: But you'll M.F.A.s--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Look I keep telling my students I don't care what kind of degree you got or whatever we were all four professors, Ray Price was the chief curator of DuSable Museum [of African American History].  All of us were full professors.  Everybody got degrees up to you know what, and they still thought that we didn't have it.  They really thought we were stupid.  And matter one thing I give 'em credit for when we finished with our presentation and Urban League helped us down to a tee.  Man, we practiced this stuff.  They stood up and gave us a, a an ovation man; we were that good.  So, we got commissions throughout.  It was somewhere around $90,000, almost $100,000.  That's a lot of dough, man, you know (laughter), but again it gives you an idea of what you can do if you kind of get together and organize and fight and every other thing and struggle.  But, you gotta have it on a firm foundation.  It can't be just for money, can't be just for I, it's gotta be for the collective we.  And you find that on the north side, you know, hey they fighting for us, but they come together and they came together when the [Chicago Mayor] Harold Washington, Harold Washington dead they got the, they got the library there and everything and they divided that library up like a fat cow.  I was never so hurt and crushed in my entire life the way they did that, that library.  I went to a meeting and they told me I couldn't speak.  Okay, I won't get into that.
Story_ID: 72587
Speaker 1: So, we were talking about your activism and the price you had to pay for--
Speaker 2: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: --the price you had to pay for activism--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --as an artist--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Aah.
Speaker 1: --you, you have raised some hell in the city [Chicago, Illinois] and they've kind of flagged you.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, oh yes.  I think the biggest--and, and the thing happened was it was over the Harold Washington Library and everything else.   And we heard about the meeting and everything else where they were dividing up the artists, show this, who we gon' select for that and every other thing and I, and I asked if I could come.  They said "Yeah you can come, but you can't say anything," and I was pissed off with that; excuse the language).
Speaker 1: Why did they say you couldn't say anything?  What was the, what rule were--
Speaker 2: You aren't on the committee.
Speaker 1: Oh, so this is a committee meeting?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: To discuss artworks that were going--
Speaker 2: Going in the Harold Washington Library and every other thing.  So--
Speaker 1: And where there any black people on the committee?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, and I don't wanna go--what's this big time--(unclear)--what's this guy's name.  He was really, really-, no, no Richard wasn't out.  I'm trying to think of his name.  He's really, really big.  He's as big as Richard or bigger.  I'm trying to think of his name.  He's up in New York now, I believe.  I'm trying to think of his name.
Speaker 1: OFF-CAMER MALE VOICE:  Hold it, hold it, sorry.  If you look down too much it--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Okay, it rubs it, oh okay.  Now, I'm trying to think.  But, at any rate I'm trying to think of his name.  Now, I'll think of it in a few minutes.
Speaker 1: But, that's okay, we--well--so, so they--it was somebody from New York was on the committee?
Speaker 2: No, he's from Chicago.
Speaker 1: He's from Chicago?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, um-hum, got his rep here and all this other kind of stuff and very, very big, very, very important and everything else.
Speaker 1: --(Unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, I, I was, I was sitting there, man, and was watching this I said "I don't believe this stuff," 'cause I know the Latino guys, you know, and we, we talked and so we had a little rapport going.  I didn't have any rapport going with the white fellows, but at any rate, the people who were there were the gallery owners.  I mean come on, this supposed to be a committee meeting and they invited the gallery owners who were there.  They were--I have never been at this age, you know when you get, you know something that hits you like that it hurts you so bad and here, you know, of course our strong connection with [Chicago Mayor] Harold [Washington] and everything they were dividing that library up like a cow.  And "Did you get this?  Oh, I got a person who could take this and you know my man could, could do that and everything else.  I'll drop what I was after, you know, your man could take this like a-" this was the way they were dividing it up , man, and the Latino guys, they went and cut--they were smart, sharp, and they got what they were supposed to get out of it 'cause they said, "Okay you can get, in other words you got what you want, my man, I got my man over here to get this and I can get this."  Where were the black artists?  Nowhere to be found and what they did was say okay now we haven't forgotten the black artists.  We gon' invite, you know, some, some of the big time black artists in, you know.  But, my whole thing like that--
Speaker 1: From out of town.
Speaker 2: From out of town.  My whole thing like that you do not go up to New York [New York City, New York] and get commissions and run over those ar, artists in New York.  They will have a fit.  Why can, why do we have to--we have enough accomplished black artists here in this city that you can pass out those things.  So, at any rate not only did they do that they said nothing, nothing was happening, we weren't gon' get anything.  Then, and I shouldn't name her name and all this other kind of stuff, and this is where one of the committee members and I and everything else we fell out over this, and we had, we were on a talk show and we went head to head and every other thing and I really told her off and everything else.  She had the audacity to say--I said "Not only did you do that, you invite, you know, Jacob Lawrence and other folk."  I have nothing against you Jake and all this other kind of stuff.  Norman Aliki (ph.), great artist, Aliki, "Hey but we live here in Chicago.  This was our mayor.  We supported him.  We worked for him and everything, and you mean to tell me we can't get some of it?"  I said, "Not only that what you've done is-"
Speaker 1: We have Artists for Washington.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had a big old, big old organization, Larry.  None of us there.  Nobody in the room.  Those guys were--and I said--I almost had a heart attack.  I had to talk to myself.  I said man you about to get a big, you about to have a sure enough heart attack 'cause I was so mad.  And then not only that [HM] Margaret Burroughs wasn't on it.  And I had this particular person, I'm not gon' name her name and all this other kind of stuff, and we got on talk radio and she had nerve enough to say something.  "Why isn't Margaret on it?"  Okay, we in Chicago are not big enough, but the guys on the North Side, the white guys on the North Side are big enough.  The Latinos are big enough, but we aren't big enough as black artists being, okay, cool that's--(unclear)--, "What happened to Margaret Burroughs?"  She said "Well you know something?" and I could have jumped through that telephone--
Story_ID: 72588
Speaker 1: I hate to be violent and everything else.  If I could have jumped through that telephone, and I hate to li, loose my composure and everything, she said that [HM] Dr. [Margaret] Burroughs did not have the ability, and I got the tape.  "She did not, she could not design well enough.  She was not a good enough artist to be in the Harold Washington Library."  And I told her, I said I, "How dare you.  She was teaching art when you and I were running races and jumping hopscotch and doing all these other stuff and, and what an insult to this woman.  What a grand insult."  I said, "You ought to be a shammed of yourself," and I went on and called her some other choice names and every other thing that I had to say.  But, that's the kind of stuff that we were dealing with, and the only way that they have any of the murals and the other stuff in there is that they felt bad because Raymon Price and I were talking and everything, and he called 'em up and got on their case a little bit and everything else.  They were doing the whole thing without even--the family had not even seen the plans of the library.  I was gonna be or ask the family to be involved in it or to stay anything to the family about the whole thing.  And that's how Ramon [Price] got into it and all this other kind of stuff.  These, that's from the inside, and so this was how I fell out because I was raising and acting--I told her that I (laughter), I said, "We picking them and we doing all this other," but see and that was an unsmart move by, by, threatening them the way that I did.  In other words, don't threaten unless you really got the forces to back it up, and so that's one of, and so of course I paid for it and everything else.  They would never, I would never have a piece of artwork down there in the Harold Washington Library, and they let me know that too, you know.  So, at any rate the bottom line was they got Jacob Lawrence and got the other folk in there and they got the whites and the Latinos.  The Latinos told me, this is my right hand, the Latinos told me said, "Look Ford you know something, said you guys are not organized.  We are organized.  We are gonna get our share in that Harold Washington Library or it won't go up or it won't open.  And we know how to carry out our threats.  You guys don't."  Said, "We gonna get ours" and they certainly got their share and more.  And the guy told me, said, "Ford I feel," I'm--he said "Ford I feel sorry for you guys."  He said, "Because you aren't, you deserve it, and you aren't gon' get it." He said, "But that's the way it is.  If you aren't organized and you aren't together you don't get anything 'cause we gon' get ours," and they certainly got theirs and that's how that Harold Wa, that's how the Harold Washington thing went down.
Speaker 2: Now--
Speaker 1: And let me get one more last thing.  We asked them okay--this is how they can do you.  We asked them, "So give us the, the, the percentages of white artists versus black artists, where they came from, if it is a gallery connections, and all this other kind of stuff, Freedom of Information Act."  They told us we can that Freedom Information Act and shove it.  Get a lawyer.  We ain't got any money.  --(Unclear)--that's that whole old corporate thing, you know, string you out, take you to court, pull all that kind of stuff.  How can you, how can you win on a deal like that.  That's what they told us.  We wrote 'em.
Story_ID: 72589
Speaker 1: I, I suppose, I mean I--do you think it really would be difficult to rally the black community around something like art, I mean--
Speaker 2: Yeah, almost impossible, almost impossible.  We been--
Speaker 1: Are there, well, you know, what, what do you think is the reason?
Speaker 2: I--we just not art oriented nothing.  If it was music man, if it would have been some of that rap stuff down there, you know, we probably, hey man, it a been jammed down there.  You follow what I'm saying because it's the end--
Speaker 1: Do you think it is because we don't see it as a business or?
Speaker 2: We don't see it as a business.  We don't, we don't understand how much money there is in it, and it is, there are, it's just awesome amount of money.  This is why we were trying to in terms with the hotels.  I used to always tell, tell the people in the group, said "Can you imagine if we can tackle, do some of these new buildings that go up and everything else, can you image how much artwork goes into these offices.  Even if we got a little one or one and half, two percent of something like--if we got that, man, we could, we all could be, have summer homes and everything else like some of the guys on the North Side have."  I said that, it's that kind of money in it.  If we got as black artists and we were organized and got one and a half percent, not ten percent, one and a half, five percent or whatever, we could be in fat city.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're talking about the percent for art laws
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --that require that a certain percentage be used for park public artist supposed to be pulled from a pool of, of a general pool of people--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --includes everybody that, that wants to be involved in it.
Speaker 2: That's right,
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Woo, I mean, but it's the money is just, is just unreal.  And we even tried to deal with, with, with some of the galleries.  Man, they cut our throat so, told us like, "You guys aren't artists.  We like a few of you," and then the few that they said that they liked they jerked them around and everything.  It was a very, very, very bad experience, and nobody got anything 'cause they were just playing the game.  We got some black artists for trying--
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yep.  I mean it's engrained and it's as deep and engrained as it possibly can get.
Story_ID: 72590
Speaker 1: Okay, with that, that in mind and with all that you've learned in, in this life in art, what, what do you see as, as your legacy to future generations?
Speaker 2: The only thing that I can, that I can say is that you know I've, I just tried to, you know, do the best that I could and tried to be a good African man/artist and work within as many principals as I could in terms of African culture.  And reason I'm saying that is because that is what has lasted is that, that our, you know, what we think of and believe as a people in Africa has endured.  Yeah, I mean, we under the gun now, but we aren't totally out of it and we been under the gun before, and we have survived everything.  And I think we, if you got your principles correct and you're working for the interests of your people, showing them and guiding them and helping them like a priest would do, but again being beautiful, we are beautiful people and we like beautiful images.  And if I've done that then I'm, I'm happy 'cause I've worked within the principles of, of, of a good African artist and from the time of Norma (ph.) everybody else they've work with, an artist were involved.  They were concerned and they had a, you know, they were on a high level and we just lost so much.  So, I just try and do the best that I can and, and you know it's hard putting--how can you sum up yourself.  I think that's a very, very difficult thing to do, but hey do your best and maybe I've influenced somebody and I have students who say "Yeah man you've done this for me" and all that kind of stuff and I'm appreciative and I'm proud of it, but I just hope--you know that there are others out there and, and I'm still going strong, you know.
Speaker 1: Is there anything that you would do differently or you, which you would have time to do?
Speaker 2: Not, not really one thing, Larry.  I think it's just been, it's been almost picture book.  I mean, I, I, maybe I, I, I'm, I'm almost a workaholic and so I put all the time and all the energy in it and every other thing and I, I couldn't ask, I mean, you supposed to be much more critical of yourself, but I couldn't ask too much more.  I've given it all and I've gotten it back, and I'm satisfied, you know.
Story_ID: 72591
Speaker 1: So, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Somebody who tried and somebody who lived within the principles of mother Africa, you know, and hey and that's it.  It's an African man.
Speaker 1: Do you think your mother [Carrie Stone Ford] and father [Thomas Ford, Jr.] would be proud of you?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, oh yes indeed, yes.  I always tell my sisters, and I used to tell my sisters and my brother, I said "Hey made my career, I mean, I mean, you know I'm just nothing but an out, outcome of what they just poured into me and the rest of the family and everybody else and stuff," you know, somebody, you just hope people are proud of you and everything and they all live long enough to say, "Hey proud of what you're doing, just keep on doing it," and I think they would be, I think they still are proud of me, you know, 'cause hey I haven't given up.  I could walk or gone someplace else and done something else and all that kind of stuff, but Larry, I think I'm the most, the happiest and the blessed person around.  I just couldn't ask anymore.  Yeah, I eat every day, I got good health, you know, I'm still hanging in there.  I got a great job.  The university [Chicago State University in Illinois], you know, tolerates me and loves me off and on and all that kind of stuff, you know, so what can you, you know, actually you can't ask anymore, you know, and, and I don't know.  You know it's just, hey, I'm satisfied and I wish I could have done some bigger monumental piece.  I used to dream of doing pieces two and three blocks long, you know, great big fellows, you know.  That's what I prob, you know, on, on, on the model in terms of the guys in Kemet, the grand, the stuff that's great stuff, you know, that as, as Jake [HM Dr. Jacob H. Carruthers] would say, "Stuff that last, stuff that last for an eternity," that's what I would, you know so-everybody--here we are we still looking at the pyramids, still admiring the great work.  We still admiring the temples and the tombs and everything else.  When you want to do work that's gonna influence and, and stand out like the pyramids and other things that's saying something, man, I mean, you, you in some heavy, heavy, heavy company, and that's what I wanted.  We still trying to phantom, like Jake said, you know, the deep African principles of spiritualness.  We haven't even tapped that yet, and Jake keeps reminding us of that and everything else.  And it's so far, so much more deeper we have to go and that's the only thing I can regret maybe sometimes I say I could have gotten into this business and could have learned more and everything at an early age, but that's the way it worked.  I did the best with what I could when I could, and I met the right people.  And to end the whole thing you know, sometimes I get chills or goose bumps I said what if I hadn't met Jake and Andy [Anderson Thompson] and [HM] Margaret [Burroughs] and all these other folks, you know, where would I be?  Yeah, probably making some money at some other university, you know, but not being that spiritual person and going in the direction that I'm going in now.  I'm so, I could, I could hardly wait to get to work in the morning.  Here I am supposedly retired, emeritus man, and I come in there like a regular job, man, because you know you, you'll lose it if you don't, you know, and, and that keeps you alive.  It keeps you invigorated, and people say "Why you wanna work so hard, why don't you cool out?" and I'll end with this and I tell everybody I say, "I say I'm not tired, I said because when I come here and I work on the Kemetic stuff and I work on the Orishas from Brazil, I said I'm meditating.  That's my time with the creator, and I feel good."  I said, "Man, that, that spring in my step and every other thing," I said, "You can't ask for anymore than that."  I said, "When you get that feeling you know that you've reach," I said, "and that's why I'm happy to get here every day because they lay out the stuff for me and open my mind, open that spiritual eye, man, and I can, I can do some, some, I think, some great things, you know, and there still is yet to, a lot more to come."  So, I'm happy every day, every morning, I'm, I'm happy to get out.  I always time it to see how early I can get her and since my wife [Thelma Ford] has passed away and everything stay late.  Man, if, if I had a, if I could have a bed here I think I would have one, man, it's, it's that, I'm that in tune with it.
Story_ID: 72592
Speaker 1: You, yeah we didn't talk about your wife.  What was your wife's name?
Speaker 2: Thelma [Ford].
Speaker 1: Thelma, and I know she passed away recently.
Speaker 2: It's almost a year now.
Speaker 1: And you have a son.
Speaker 2: A son, Rangi and a daughter Maji.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so neither one of them in the art business, not interested in it.  They far away as you can--my daughter is a good writer, but she didn't wanna get into it and every other--she is supremely good.  You know one of these days I hope that she will go on and take--when I say good you hate saying that about, you know, about your kids and everything, she has got the gift.  I said, "Why don't you gon' and one of these times you ought to start writing short stories" and if she, when I say really, really, really gifted like your son, that's the way she is.  But, you know, she's doing her stuff in the corporate world, you know trying to support her family, but hey that's cool.  Everybody's doing fine, man, and no complaints.  I just every time I get a chance, you know, and I'm, I'm taking off going to--and they push me dad gon' and go on back to Brazil or go on to Africa or wherever and everything else, so Africa is, you know, is such an integral part in terms of our lives still, you know.
Story_ID: 72593
Speaker 1: OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE:  Go head now and we wanna know when and where this was taken.
Speaker 2: I think it was taken here at Chicago State [University in Illinois].  I'm almost for certain.  It's probably-
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: It was taken, I think it was probably before some art show, I believe.  That's when about 1980 something like that.
Speaker 1: That, that, that was about 19-
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: About 1970, I think about '78' [1978] or something like that.  And that was in the study and I was welding.  It was, and it was an African, it was an African head mask like thing, and one of those kind of pieces that, you know, you wish you had back.  I could have sold that for ten times the amount of money that I sold it for (laughter).  But, anyway I, I enjoyed the piece and so it was, it was, I think it was a nice picture and so the weld, the whole welding thing and I like people to kind of see that you know--
Speaker 2: Homage to the ancestors and that's at Inner City Studies [Northeastern Illinois University Center for Inner City Studies in Chicago, Illinois] and I, I think one of my favorite pieces because you can in that, you know, that I use mixed media 'cause I welded it first and then put the wood and put all the mixed media on afterwards, you know, so that aluminum in the background and everything else is on wood and, and plexiglass and then media on top of that plexiglass.  So, it's about three layers going on it, and it's--I just love--everybody loves it and still at Inner City Studies and everybody--it, it really speaks to the building and it's, it's, you know, I, I think is one of, one of those pieces that you said that, you know, that it, it kind of did something for you in the community; I think that's the one.
Speaker 1: A big huge dedication and that's Dr. Don Bailey on the left and that's [HM Dr. Jacob H.] Jake Carruthers, Dr. Carruthers on the first.  In the back is oh, shoot, what's his--Ramsies (ph.), Ramsies the second.  Okay, Ramsies the second and his wife in the background back there.  You see I, I swirled the bronze, the, the aluminum so you hide--it, it reflects the light and everything else, so different angles, you get different kind of lighting effect on it in which I like about it and, and a lot of times early in the morning it has a real, real interesting affect with that light coming in, in different ways.
Speaker 2: So, we did the Tree of Life here at the university.  They commissioned me here at Chicago State and that's still up over at the administration building.  And that's [HM] Dr. Dolores [E.] Cross, the president of the university, on the left and [HM] Professor Haki Madhubuti on the right, famous, famous writer, poet.  And so we are, we are dedicating the piece, and we had a huge, huge, huge crowd and we poured libations for the first time here at this university, at the university.
Speaker 1: You can see the size of it, you know, in relationship to me, and, and it turns out nice.  So you can see what I'm talking about in term--it looks like its got a light around the face and everything else, and that's that reflective quality of it, you know, when the light hits it in certain ways it, it, the whole thing just lights up.  I had a lot of fun with it, and everybody still loves it.  And again all bronze and mixed media.
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE:  Do you ever get to specify the lighting that they install?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I always try, I always ask them if they can put a spotlight up on it 'cause it, it, the light bounces and does all kind of interesting things on it.  So, they put a special track lighting up there and so it, it really is, it's affective.
Speaker 2: Theater complex, complete theater complex, the largest one, African American one in the City of Chicago and they commissioned me to do it in three panels and it's about 30 feet long and about 12 feet high.  And it, and you can see it's got the spotlights on it and everything else and so it really turned out, turned out very, very nice.  And so that's their logo and I had to deal with that.  It was already there established and hid there and so all I did was dress it up and use my style, and you have the Wings of Horus and I use the Egyptian thing with it or the Kemetic thing with the wings, which mean, somewhat in terms of leadership and authority so the area around in here these are the wings and I've just opened it up around here and come in there so Horus, the leadership and qualities surrounding, the leadership qualities surrounding eta [Creative Arts Foundation].
Speaker 1: African Temple of Chicago commissioned me to do the piece, and you can see that gives you a good idea in terms of, in terms of the scale and it's a lectures pod, a podium and so I, I think it's very, very effective.  It has Bronze and it's mixed media with plexiglass and gold and everything else.  I think it works very, very well.  It's an outstanding piece.  Everybody always likes it.
Speaker 2: Did you identify--(unclear)--
Speaker 1: [Yvette] Jones is on the left and Rosetta Cash is on the right and their masters in terms of the, the Kemetic language and everything, the Kemetic, the ke, ke, the whole Kemetic culture.
Speaker 2: They commissioned me to do the piece on-
Speaker 1: OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE:  --(Unclear)--do lower left or--
Speaker 2: Upper right.
Speaker 1: OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE:  Okay upper right.  Oh, is that similar to the one--it's similar, but different from the one that's on the--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: It's a carryover, so it's called "Bird from the Bend of the Niger River."  They fell in love with that thing.  I mean it actually was supposed to go when you come into the, when you come in the main entrance on Michigan Avenue [Chicago, Illinois] and they were afraid that people would, with the, with the luggage would hit it and everything else, and so we put it, they put it upstairs in the gallery and it's called the Steven's gallery I believe it is.  It's the international gallery.  So, they just love that piece.
Speaker 1: OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE:  What year was this taken do you know?
Speaker 2: Ooh, shoot, when was this--
Speaker 1: Late '80's [1980s] right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Farrell Advertising they needed a sculptor, and it was a real coup for me, you know, 'cause only the real, real big international sculptors, a guy like [HM] Richard Hunt and other people, so--and you know the sponsors of course is, you know, the, the liquor, but that's all right they did a nice job.  They had all the art work out and, and it turned out nice and it was in all the populations, "Essence", "Jet", "Ebony", man, and every, all those national publications.  So, I have a whole book--(unclear)--done, so they, they really, you know, really liked it.  And every now and then they'll pull it back out and run it again, you know.  So, it was a real coup, you know, for me.
Speaker 2: That one was called, "Oya and Oshun Dance for Life."  That's the Yoruba thing, you know, and two dancers and they're dancing because Shango is alive, and that's polished, welded and polished aluminum.  So, it, it's still on campus.  It's, it's gotta be cleaned, but it, you know, it was really sharp then 'cause it's all mirrored all on the inside there and everything else.  So, it really turned out nice; I liked it.
Speaker 1: This is on the Chicago campus?
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE)
Speaker 1: This one, oh I did, Juju Man from Nigeria.  That was at an international show in, in Atlanta, and it was  well received, Juju Man of--and so it's aluminum and, and brass and bronze, and it really is a very, very unusual piece.
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE:  Do you know the date for this?
Speaker 1: February 21, 1986.
Speaker 2: That one is at--it's called Mut.  She's literally the mother and it's at the Kemetic Institute [Chicago, Illinois], and it's a combination of materials.  I got, I think I got everything in the world under there and in it and wire-based strong, steel-wire base under it, and it's been built up with plaster and then it's got the gold mask and with all the decoration.  It's a big piece.  It's almost if it had been floor length it would have been life size.  It's half life size.
Speaker 1: OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE:  When was it taken?
Speaker 2: When was this one, about a couple of years ago now, yeah.  This was one was done, it was done about 2000 I believe it was.  So, it's a big, it's a--
Speaker 1: And the man next to me is named Champion.  He's, he's our guide and he got his name from being the fastest climber up the pyramids.
Speaker 2: He, he's an Egyptian?
Speaker 1: He's an Egyptian, so yeah--so we are, we are in Cairo at the Giza Plateau and we've been all around and all in the tombs and everything else, what normal people never ever see, you know, so he's got all the inside connections.  So, we're taking a little tea break and the rising of the sun is coming up and everything.
