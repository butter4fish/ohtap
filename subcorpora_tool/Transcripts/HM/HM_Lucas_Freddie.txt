Story_ID: 10301
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about your mother starting with her name, where she was born and how she grew up, that kind of thing.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Mom [Frances Berry Hill] was an only child.  She was born April the 25th, 1908 in Lynchburg, Virginia in the front room of that home in Lynchburg at 906 8th Street.  Her parents were Nathaniel Fred Berry and Cora Corinne Cox Berry.  She was doted upon by her parents and grew up knowing that she was absolutely the most special person in the world.  But somehow she was not spoiled and people have often spoken of that throughout her life or throughout my life to me about her.  She went to the public schools in Lynchburg, Virginia.  She graduated from all of her classes throughout her degree-bearing years with the highest grades and therefore was valedictorian of all of her classes, including one questionable one from Oberlin [College, Oberlin, Ohio] when supposedly, the way I have heard it, she finished number one in her class at Oberlin in the music department, however, was not awarded the prize, number one prize that they tended to give at that particular time.  My brother [Talmadge Layman Hill Jr.] and I took her back to her sixtieth anniversary and tried to find out about that and we never were able to get any information during the three days we were there that allowed us to know finally, once and for all, that she had been its valedictorian also.  But I got away from the story that you asked me to tell about her life.
Speaker 1: No, just tell us a little bit about her growing up and what you know about her background, that kind of thing.
Speaker 2: Interesting background.  Her mother, Cora, was born to Frances Cox, Frances Jones Cox.  And from what we can tell, my brother and I, she and Mr. Cox were not married when Frances, when Cora was born.  And whether they actually married we don't know.  So we have seen in the records that have been kept because we had after the death of our mother to do some closing of her estate.  And we found out a lot about when the property had been obtained, from whom it had been obtained, how much it had cost and who paid what the cost of the property was.  And my great grandmother who was Frances Cox, Frances Jones Cox had been reared on an estate in, in Lynchburg or in the surrounding area of Lynchburg and we're just not sure--though we knew she lived indoors inside the "big house", we are not sure of just who the--what happened, what the relationship was.  And since the colors of other people came down, we have ideas of what happened.  My grandmother, Cora, was a little ashamed of this and this is one of the secrets that was not discussed.  After her death, her husband, my grandfather from, for whom I'm named, he went by N. Fred Berry though I have told you his first name was Nathaniel, shared with me the facts that I have told you already.  And that there were other relatives who we're not associated with and whether it was on the side of my grandmother and her mother or on their side I'm not quite sure.  But there was never any indication that there were other than one cousin and one second cousin, etc., in all of our lives.  But I do have the sneaking suspicion there's another set of Joneses that we know very little about.  Mom finished the high school there.  They were of course segregated schools and went on to Morgan, Morgan College it was at the time.  She was sixteen when she went to Morgan.  She was--lived with two friends or roomed with two people with whom she became quite close all of her adult life.  And I think there is only one of the three remaining alive today.  The--they together came to Howard University [Washington, D.C.] and were inducted into Delta Sigma Theta sorority, then returned to Morgan [State College, now University, Baltimore, Maryland] and started the chapter Alpha Gamma at Morgan, so that was a special something.  They went against the tide.  There wasn't AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.] on the campus at that time but they went against that tide and, they and a few others.  Mom was a music major and her, as her mother was an organist at the church in Lynchburg, Virginia, though her mother was a principal of an elementary school.  Mom took the music, was the organist at Morgan also, sometimes played before she had graduated but she graduated and went on to Oberlin and spent four years at Oberlin, finished in June and married that next August--that same August of that summer.  The--she married my father whom she met at Morgan.

Speaker 1: What was your father's name?
Speaker 2: And his name was Talmadge, T-A-L-M-A-D-G-E, Layman, L-A-Y-M-A-N, Hill.  He having been born in New Jersey, East Orange, New Jersey and his dad was A. A. Hill--had a grocery store.  That's Anselem Artis Hill, but he always went by A. A.  People referred to him if they didn't say 'Deacon', because he was a deacon in a Baptist church in Orange, New Jersey.  They either--knowing him well they called him A. A. or Deacon Hill.  His wife, Deacon Hill's wife was Eliza Ann Tynes Hills and she and three of her siblings had grown up in an area of Virginia called Tynes Corner.  When the Tyneses had received their however many acres and a mule it was subdivided for each of these children.  For some reason that I've not figured out yet and perhaps it was indeed for better pursuits, A. A. Hill and Eliza Ann Tynes Hill married and moved to New Jersey where they remained the rest of their lives with very few trips back that I understand that they made.  In any event, Talmadge Hill was sent to Morgan's [Morgan State College, now University, Baltimore, Maryland] pre-college program and was there ahead of my mom, Frances.  And, but was in her class when they, when Frances arrived.  They started out together in the class of 1924.  They finished in '28 [1928].  Mom [Frances Berry Hill] went to Oberlin [College, Oberlin, Ohio] until '32 [1932] and they were married in the summer of '32 [1932], had my brother, Talmadge L. Hill, Jr., in '33 [1933], followed by a daughter named Eliza, Cora Eliza Hill who lived about a month before she died of pneumonia.  That was, those two births took place in Baltimore, Maryland.  And with the death of my sister and the next pregnancy, my mom was instructed to go to Lynchburg, Virginia to her mom and grandmother and await my birth.  And my mother said I was due the first of December.  And because all the exercise she ever got was getting down into the bed or getting up from the bed and sitting in a rocking chair that she thought I would never come.  So I was born in January, six weeks later came back with her to Baltimore.  Mom and dad were very fortunate.  They lived right on campus.  My dad had gone, wanting a law degree, had gone to NYU [New York University, New York, New York], but at that time needed to afford the course work.  So after a semester he came back and was offered a position as assistant professor of whatever they--instructor, not that.  He was an instructor first, an instructor.  And I think he may even have been an assistant instructor in the biology department where he had most of his major at that time or when he was in school, and to work with the football team and the basketball teams that a new coach had just come, Coach Eddie P. Hurt, to take over.  His name was Edward Paulette Hurt and since I had a boy's first name I always teased him about Paulette.  But he was a great gentleman.  He too has passed.  I don't know (unclear)--the--my parents lived on the campus so they didn't have to worry too much about where they were going to stay as many people did because you think of '32 [1932] and they, '29 [1929] the had the stock market busted.  '32 [1932] was gearing up for the First World War.  Was that right?  No, no, no they were past the First World War.  Well they weren't quite gearing up for the second one.  But anyhow, they were just coming out of the, with the stock market bust and so there was not very much money.  In fact they used to talk about how little money they made but they said they, that the college told them that they made up for it in housing that they paid next to nothing for.  The heat and the electricity was all provided so they really only had to buy food and take care of their clothes.  And they roomed on the second floor of a home on campus and on the first floor was another couple that was there, an older couple.  My mom said that that lady had been very helpful to her because she couldn't iron shirt one.  But she did so poorly ironing with crows in the collars and men did not like that at the time when you didn't have had the correct amount of starch or too much starch that my dad gave in and decided from then on the shirts would go out.  So she told me whatever you start doing in the beginning be sure that's what you want to continue.  I liked that.  So she made--didn't necessarily try to get rid of the little whatever was in the, the crow's feet or something in the shirts but went forward that way.  And to my knowledge she never did another shirt again.  Not during my lifetime.  But anyway they lived there for a number of years and then moved to their own apartment on the campus, a third floor of a three story building and there we remained until I was thirteen years old and they were going to demolish that building and put a gymnasium in its spot which they did, the Eddie P. Hurt Gymnasium.  And then there was a stadium that was behind our building.  We could sit on our fire escape and watch if it were raining, something going on because many of the black schools, colored schools came out to have their commencements and their football games, etc., and their track meets at Morgan Stadium and that was always a fun time with one exception.  We learned after one dreadful event to be cautious.  We kept, my brother and I--our bi--bicycles downstairs so that we didn't lug them up and down and there was enough room.  But the front door was always open and after a particular game and it could have been any kids anywhere, we'd get on the porch and wait for rides or what not, someone then decided to see about these bikes and the bikes disappeared.  My dad said, "Well we bought those bikes once.  That's as much as we can afford to buy."  So the rest of my life I did not have a bicycle, did not ever get another.  No grandparent gave us one or anything.  And I made the poor decision then that I did follow through with the rest of my life when I said my children won't have that problem especially if it was not their fault that this happened.  I would at least find a way that they could work off the, the cost of the bike.  But it didn't matter, I didn't get a bike again.
Speaker 1: Ms. Lucas if you will, tell me a little bit about your ancestors.  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Well I can go only back to I guess my great grandparents and only knowing about the, the man in the--the Coxes on my mom's side.  You had asked about--.
Speaker 1: Your ancestors.
Speaker 2: --about the ancestors.  And on my mother's side I think I can, can safely say that we would go back and try to find out the Cox family and we could go back to the deed for instance and know that it was a Cox who had purchased the, the home for my grandmother and sold it to her for a dollar.  My grandmother, my great grandmother sold it to my grandmother for a dollar and her husband Nathaniel Fred Berry.  And then they in turn sold it to my mother for a dollar so that it sort of went that way.  And then my brother and I ended up giving it back to the city in--because it became a part of the historic area of the city of Lynchburg for them to be able to deal with whatever they wanted to do.

Speaker 1: What can you tell me--actually what is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: My earliest memory?  Whether or not someone told me this or I actually can remember this, but I can remember being on the first floor of this three story apartment in the living room of Dean George Grant and his wife Margaret and they had two sons and a daughter who were some size then.  I was a--at three or four I was a flower girl in the daughter's wedding.  I remember that of course at five, four or five.  But I think either I was told this or I remember when I took my first steps.  I remember the people saying, come on, come on you can do it.  Come on.  And I remember the feeling, that's what I remember the feeling of sort of moving on my own and moving on my own and the applause.  I moved and they applauded.  I remember that.  I believe I remember it.  Maybe somebody told that to me.  That's--you ask me about the earliest.  To my knowledge that's--that particular incident I do believe I remember.
Speaker 1: And what was your family life like growing up?  What was a typical day like in your house?
Speaker 2: A typical day?  My dad [Talmadge Layman Hill] was very strict and, and I (interferes with mic)--and well see it's authority figure, whatever the adjective would be.  And he tended to require your presence at breakfast, dressed. And you had your eight glass, your eight ounce glass of milk and I swear to god it was more like twelve.  I don't drink milk now because of having to drink milk at home definitely at breakfast and at dinner.  But before school at--before I went to school, at lunch too and I would say I got so full of the milk I can't eat anything else.  But anyway, and you stayed there--it could get warm, it could turn to butter but you learned early just get it over with and be done.  And so we had the milk that we had to have.  He was not as concerned about the water because we tended to turn around and drink the water anyhow, but the milk we had to have.  And it used to come in bottles with the paper type tops on them.  You take that top off and then pick up, unplug whatever the sealing, sealer was and pour the milk into your glasses.  And we had the Green Spring Dairy bring this milk as long as I, until they finally stopped and I was probably in college at that time.  And so we could get bread, milk from Green Spring Dairy, cream if they wanted the little bottles of cream and butter, those things you could purchase and order them and have them come regularly.  They could leave them outside your door and no one touched them.  And you could get--and then you'd take your bottle, write what you'd want and stitch the note in the top of the bottle and set it back outside the door and they would come and get it and, and fulfill your order.  That's something else that's interesting that's not done of course anymore.  I guess it's just impossible to do.  Too many people evidently.  And it sort of got rid of some of the drivers and their jobs.  And so you stop and you think about all of the various jobs that went away with certain kinds of actions that people had.  You got to know those people, they got to know you.  They asked about, well how was graduation from junior high school?  And did you wear that dress you've been crying over?  We had to make our graduation dresses in junior high school.  And if you know what a gusset is you'll understand why parents were just so disturbed about these girls making these dresses.  A gusset is a triangle that's placed under the arm.  Now why any teacher allowed us to pick a pattern that had a gusset which would give you some flexibility under your arm so you had the gusset that did that.  This--well not a diamond, not a triangle, a diamond shape.  Well you should have seen that white material by the time all of us had scooted and pushed and pulled and what have you, it was just terrible.  And most parents did exactly what my mom did, eventually took that, had it cleaned, had somebody she knew sew that gusset in there and send it on back to school.  And we either all either looked like 'who-shot-john' going down the aisle but it, it, it got done.  But the milkman would know that that was going on you see.
Story_ID: 10304
Speaker 1: Tell me what holidays were like in your house and other special occasions?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Every other year we went to one home or the other of our grandparents' homes for either Christmas or Easter.  So if we were in Lynchburg for one Christmas we--that meant Easter was in New Jersey and then the next year we would reverse it.  My dad I told you was fairly stern and yet you could get around him so easily, you know.  He would give off this being you know strict, etc.  But you know you try to give your reasons for things and if you could come and explain your case and that's what it got to be, I think he always felt since he never went back and got a law degree that he was practicing his law on us.  But if you could explain your case to him then you know he would consider it.  Now when you would go to my grandparents' homes, either one, but particularly my mom's, who were a little younger especially my grandmother than my father's parents who were a little older than my grandmother, because my granddad was probably in the same category with my grandfather [A.A. Hill], with my father's parents.  Their table life was I think, that's where we all really congregated.  We either sat at a huge table in the, and this was a huge kitchen.  It was an L of the house because they sort of added on.  At first was one part then they added another part, then they went this way and then they went up.  And so there was this huge table that they would sit, we would sit at for our meals and on special occasions, Christmas dinner, or a birthday dinner or something, then we went into the dining room which had another huge table and we would just sit there.  We could sit there for hours but they would have stories that would be told, the same stories I'm sure year after year and you would laugh as hard or, or harder.  My granddad was a great [Nathaniel Fred Berry], the one for whom I'm named, Fred was a great story teller and he would love to just get back and make anything that might happen a story.  And we would end up just sitting there crying.  And then we would leave that table and go into the parlor as they called it and we would have a--he'd put up the card table and we would play pinochle or they would play pinochle and my grandmother [Cora Cox Berry] never felt that she was a good bridge player but they would play bridge too from time to time.  As we grew up we learned to keep score and then we finally got to play the games with them.  And my grandmother never liked for my mother or for myself or my brother to lose and she'd say, (unclear), how would--if he would trump something, why would you do that?  He said, "Cora, I'm playing the game.  Now you won that last game.  The children should have an opportunity.  Say, well let them learn the game," and it would go on and on.  But he would, he would do things like that.  You asked about being there, we would have, we had set hours of going to bed and I--they had set rules.  My brother could go and play basketball on the YMCA court which wasn't too far from the house but I wasn't allowed to go around there.  Only thing I could do was go to Sunday school where there were other children or finally to the, what is it, the youth groups and we then participated in every church youth group there was in order that I could go do something.  Otherwise you sat and you read.  They had plenty of books and you had an opportunity to take a selection and they brought a series for my mom that I have not found since.  And so I said that I was on behalf of my own kids going to come up and try to do something similar since I couldn't find "Marjorie Dean High School Freshman" [book series], [Marjorie Dean High School] Sophomore, Junior and Senior and then College Freshmen, Sophomore, Junior and Senior.  And I think they had one where she married the first year or something or leading up to a marriage or something.  And I've looked for that kind of series and they did have other series but not "Marjorie Dean".  So I thought we've got to come up with our own "Marjorie Dean" and do our own little story about them being freshmen, sophomore, etc., something.  So I was trying to get my daughter to model something after Hillary and her life.

Speaker 1: Can you just briefly describe your block or your community?  Describe that for us.
Speaker 2: When I grew up?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: All right.  It was Morgan Park [Baltimore, Maryland neighborhood] basically.  That's where I had blocks that I could, could look at instead of a campus.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the name of the street?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, Overland Avenue, 2503 Overland Avenue we were.  And one block north of us on the opposite side of the street was 2406 Overland Avenue and residing in that home was the founder of the Afro [American] Newspapers, Mr. Murphy.  And he has a grandchild in the helm now and, that's just an aside.  But a block and a half from us was, the cross street was, cross street was Montebello Terrace and on that block lived [sic] Bishop Love, one of the premier bishops at that particular point in time of the Episcopal church.  And then there were--I was just naming those two juxtaposition.  Many of the professional people in Baltimore [Maryland] at that, at that particular time moved to, not all of them but some of them moved to Morgan Park and across from us directly was a physician and next door to him was another physician and across from that person were two other homes and they were physicians.  We were the only ones that weren't in that category.  The--we--I--the house which was not necessarily next to us because there was a street that ran there, but it was only like a pathway.  Well one car could get through there.  And we don't say alleyway because it connected Overland with Ivy, another street.  And the president of Morgan's [ref. to Morgan State College, now University, Baltimore, Maryland] house was built there, his home, the college home was built there.  And so you mentioned Amy or someone mentioned Amy to me earlier well that's where they lived in our backyard or lawn, could, could look diagonally across the face of theirs in that area so you always kept everything neat because of that.  Anyway, dad [Talmadge Layman Hill] wouldn't have let it be otherwise.  He would--.
Speaker 1: What was--?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry [moving chair back into frame].
Speaker 1: What was it like growing up in Baltimore in the '40s [1940s]?
Speaker 2: Now I just never lived in Baltimore that way.  My parents kept us pretty mostly out on the campus or out at Morgan [State COllege, now University, Baltimore, Maryland].  My brother had a little bit more freedom and he would get to go to Pennsylvania Avenue and with his buddies to see the movies or something.  It was rare that I had a chance to go there.  We did a--one of the reasons that the women in Baltimore banned together, decided to bring in the Jack and Jill was to give us more activity and so we had a lot of different activities.  And as the group expanded you had a--all age groups and so you went from one little group and you would go into the next as you got older and you'd go on that way so that you had a cadre of folk with whom you were always having something to do.  But we didn't often go to town except for planned events.  But most of the black events were held at Morgan.  This is what segregation does.  I mean so when they wanted a bigger place to go you went there and you had whatever.  And so we didn't miss many of the activities and we were fortunate having the--either been brought up on Morgan or close to Morgan.  You name the scholar, you name the entertainer or you name the politician who was black in particular who didn't come through Morgan to speak to a convocation or what have you.  And at that time those people couldn't live in hotels, they were housed with families on the campus.  Then after whatever presentation they made formally whosever home it was at, you get a--they were staying, you'd get a chance to go there and sit around and listen to them talk on and on and on.  I mean you know, the sleeping car porter guy, A. [Asa] Phillip Randolph, I mean just some of the stories and the things that you heard.  And oh, I know who else lived in our neighborhood in Morgan Park, was W.E.B. Dubois.  Of course he, his granddaughter, I don't think she has the property anymore, no.  But they did live there, the wife and daughter even when he was away.  And her name was DuBois (unclear).  When her mother married they gave her the first name DuBois.  But you know we, we would listen to these folks.  You'd have a chance--we didn't realize at the time but we were there listening to people who were perhaps if we truly paid attention we could have gained so much more.  But you know when you throw something on the wall something sticks, you know.  It may not be much but something will stick and I think that was what most of the parents, there weren't but a couple of us on the, kids on the campus anyhow, and you were told to sit and be quiet and listen whether you wanted to be at whatever this was or not.  But that went for the recitals that people held and the whatever concerts.  I mean all the you know--if, if oh what's the, the school in the south that always sent their band, their choir?  It was a fundraiser for them?  Isn't it terrible?  This happens, Alzheimer's, but anyhow whatever--we'll talk about something else and I will recall and I'll interject it.
Story_ID: 10306
Speaker 1: Tell me what sights, sounds and smells remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh wow, well my dad [Talmadge Layman Hill] was a coach and I can tell you all about locker rooms.  And until I was eleven I used to go in while they were strapping the boys and the guys and what not and never ever thought anything.  And all of a sudden one day I was told I could not enter.  I, but I always come down when they're getting ready to get their uniforms on and all of this.  And finally dad had said young ladies you are now--now as if all of a sudden eleven I'm now a young lady and you just don't do that.  I was always with the boys anyhow cause I didn't have anybody else to play with but my brother and/or the football team.  So then they sort of sheltered me off to the, the cheerleaders who were mostly girls.
Speaker 1: What sights and sounds remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well the sight and sound of the, that is one of the things.  Other sounds of course is hearing the organ because we often would hear our mom practicing and we would be with her, that's her babysitting.  While we did homework she'd practice whatever she was doing because they also gave concerts.  And we had a creek at Morgan [State College, now University, Baltimore, Maryland].  I remember our creek that ran behind the campus and we were told never to go there which meant go.  And they could tell we always wondered but they could tell.  We had little thistles on us when we'd come back and of course we got spankings that we could now send our parents to jail for having given us.  But, but we would get our spankings but it never kept us truly from trying to get away with going to where we weren't supposed to go.
Story_ID: 10307
Speaker 1: Tell me about your elementary school years.  What was the name of your elementary school and who were some of your teachers there?
Speaker 2: Well the very first elementary school I can't even remember it's name, but I ran into someone in Baltimore [Maryland] who when I mentioned this he said he had grown up in Wilson Park.  I said oh, I went to the first grade in Wilson Park.  He said you did at that little white school?  I said yes, the one that had four, two or three classes in--cause one was an office and teacher's room or something.  And you all had all classes?  He says, "You did?"  Well we came in from wherever they came and they were there.  Anyhow he is a guy that I got to get that information for you.  He is a guy that had all sorts of civil rights history down pat.  We were attending something with the Brown v. The Board of Education [Topeka, Kansas] sort of discussion and he happened to be, had been there.  But anyway it was a, a small, not quite one room school house but that's where I remember getting my first shots for school.  We were taken there and my mom [Frances Hill Berry] had me by the hand, it was about six or eight long New York blocks from where we stayed on the campus and we walked up there and we walked back.  And we went to the--I went to the first grade there and my brother [Talmadge Berry Jr.] was in the second grade.  And then we transferred to another school where I started second grade and he the third.  Now I don't remember, all I know that was Wilson Park Elementary School but I don't think that--it had another name because this gentleman remembered another name.  And I don't remember anything else but the shot, being in this classroom and my letters.  We had letters that we were doing at, at the first grade we were doing letters.  And you had pages and pages of doing these letters.  And then the, the circles and the--and they made you do this over and over, that I remember.
Speaker 1: What kind of student were you?
Speaker 2: So-so.  I always had to work hard for whatever I got.  And the only reason I guess I worked hard was to get that applause at the end you know.  And my brother was the kind that is very thoughtful, studious, just innately intelligent.  I have a son [C. Payne Lucas Jr.] very like my brother, much like him and I have a daughter very much like me.  And I would always have to tell Hillary [Lucas] that, don't worry, when whatever it is that you get, when you get it, you've got it.  It does not mean that you have to get it in ten minutes and it may take ten hours or guess what, it may take ten years.  But if you're serious about something and you like it and you want to go over it you can get it.  And so if you studied a little longer at night than your brother did on his assignments, same thing, it happened to me so I know.  Don't feel that you can't get it done.  He could take his homework and be done everything in an hour and I'd still be struggling at midnight let's say.  He used to come in to explain something to me which was helpful.  But it used to get on my nerves that he was through and now he's coming to help me to get through and I still didn't understand whatever it was he was trying to explain, you know.  But if I didn't get it then you just keep working on it and get it.  But on thing someone used to say that, and I don't know whether it was my dad [Talmadge Layman Hill] or my granddad meaning his father [Anselem Artis Hill], about foundations.  Whatever it is you get a good foundation, and therefore I kept thinking you've got to keep doing this to get a foundation.  And they would always talk about this foundation.  I kept thinking if I don't get this foundation, god knows what will happen to me later.  So sometimes it's not bad telling kids things like that.  You never know what gets into their mind.  In my mind it was god, if I don't have this foundation and you know I could see this wobbly something or other and 'bloop'-- falling in, that's what would go through my mind and that would help keep me there.  And, and you, you can do okay if you work hard, does not mean you have to be brilliant.  And I, I truly think my brother was brilliant.  My son is really brilliant.  And yet, that doesn't make him as well rounded as some of the rest of us. (laughs)
Speaker 1: At this time in your life during the elementary school years, did you have dreams and aspirations and if so, what were they?
Speaker 2: You know, now I should lie through this part of this,but I truly didn't have that many dreams and aspirations.  I always told people that I--since everyone told me I was such a tomboy anyhow I said, "Oh I'm going to be a physical-ed teacher."  My dad was a coach so why couldn't I be a physical-ed teacher.  And I didn't particularly care for all of the physical educators that I had come in contact with, so I was going to change the world.  We're going to do things in physical education that they're not doing now.  Team sports are great--I could, where as I got older I could tell them.  But how are you going to find ten other people to play a game and then eleven others to play against you, you know if you're playing football say, but, I'm not playing football.  But I'm saying if they were playing (unclear).  I used to go through saying that.  And I said--and of course black schools didn't have any money for the gymnastic equipment and so forth.  Even the dance and you had very little space and splinters in the floor and you don't want to have on, on your, on tennis shoes.  I mean you can't dance in tennis shoes.  I mean you know, I'm sure you can do some be-bop stuff but you couldn't do some of the things that you liked to do.  And I used to say I was going to change the whole way of, of looking at physical education and I found out about orienteering.  And I used to say what a wonderful thing.  Why can't we do orienteering and, and make projects out of that.  And not only is it a life skill that one could have but you're also having the exercise of being out, if you got to climb or whatever these things are you could still do.  Oh, I went through a lot of things like that.

Speaker 1: Did you and your family attend church?  And if so--?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.  Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --what were those experiences like?
Speaker 2: Well sure, we attended the Baptist church in, in East Orange, New Jersey with my grandparents having us in tow.  And one experience that I won't forget there, I was all of twelve and thirteen and thinking I was very cute looking.  And I went outside of church after it was over and I held my mom--my mom [Frances Berry Hill] was holding my hand for some reason.  She didn't want me to go visiting with others, to stay there and meet some of these ladies.  And she said something and I was hugging and saying but mom, I, mom, something what I was going to do.  The next thing I knew, bam, this back hand and here she plays the organ anyhow and you can imagine how much force.  I had--now you can't see red but you're talking about somebody who had to have turned maroon.  I was so embarrassed.  I will never--and she said that later, she knew I'd never--she never missed a beat of her conversation.  She kept right on, bop and kept right on talking over me.  And there I was and I was mortified.  I won't forget that.  We attended church twice a day in, at our grandparents' when they had two day, two times a day services and went home, had a huge dinner and then you rested a bit and went back to church again for the evening service.  In Lynchburg [Virginia] we had a choice because my granddad was a, was a Baptist and my grand mom was a Methodist.  And so generally speaking we went to the Methodist church but on occasion we would go with papa to his church and (unclear).  And they were only a block away from the house in two different directions so that it was simple, we'd all start out and then veer wherever and then we'd come back.  Maybe we'd meet them.  Maybe we'd meet back at home.  In Baltimore [Maryland], we always attended the Morgan Christian Center which was nondenominational but originally it had been a Methodist AME founded church.  So we went there every Sunday.  They started Sunday school when they had my brother and me.  So we had some Sunday school classes there for a couple of years.  The students who had professed an interest in religion and wanting to go on into the ministry were usually the ones that worked with us in, in our Sunday school classes.  And the minister was a person whose name I put on a list.  He is not with us but his son perhaps could give many stories about his father and his father and mother's background, that kind of thing and how he was able to know and bring so many fantastic speakers to Morgan.  He was one of those who did that for the community.

Speaker 1: Ms. Lucas what was the name of your junior high school and what was junior high school like for you?
Speaker 2: The name of the junior high school was the Booker T. Washington Junior High School [Baltimore, Mayrland].  All of my schools represented people in black history.
Speaker 1: What were those years like for you?
Speaker 2: Wow, they went by quickly but I was just then beginning to really reach out and know there were other folk and doing different kinds of things.  And I think we got into volunteer activities a lot more.  We were older and, and we (unclear) we were beginning to feel we weren't little babies anymore, little toddlers or little kids that we felt some person.  When I went there the interesting thing is because as I told you my brother was smart, who--innately so, he went over to one high school and I went, was scheduled through this junior high school to another high school on separate sections of town.  But where we lived they were able to do that.  And the reason was so that I wouldn't have teachers saying, why aren't you like your brother, etc.?  So they thought well I've had some of that in elementary school.  See if we couldn't go out different ways.
Speaker 1: Who were some of your friends in junior high school?
Speaker 2: Well one of my best friends, and it's interesting how you keep these people right along was a guy that I met on the very first day.  I was a mid-year student and because of that I--and he too being a mid-year student, we were to be able to come out in the spring so that we could go to college in the fall.  We, we were thinking that even down in junior high school.  But we met in the, in the principal's office where they sent us since we didn't have a class to go directly to when you went to that school.  He was from Washington and was sent to live with his uncle and aunt.  His uncle was a bishop in a church and, and I don't know the faith.  That's why I stopped before I went on saying the wrong thing.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: Sanders, and I have his name down there, Dr. Elijah Sanders.  He now goes by Eli, one of the first black open heart surgeons that we had in the States, period and he was doing a lot of work for others, as well as for blacks.  And now he's moved on into stress management for black men in particular and aging issues.  So he's sort of carving out another kind of career.
Speaker 1: How did you spend your time in junior high school?
Speaker 2: Well, well doing what we all had to do you know.  But you know I was sort of thwarted from what happened before school and after because took us and hour and a half to get there and then I'd have to leave immediately after school and take the hour and a half to get back out to Morgan.  So you know you jam packed a lot of things in during that time. So our lunches, we did a lot of our meetings through the lunch period or before a particular class and the ending of another we'd sort of sandwich in little meetings or whatever.  The girls would get together, we'd go to the bathrooms and we'd talk about the boys, that kind of thing.  We did you know most things I'm sure kids do now except we didn't walk home.  I didn't get to walk home with people.  I went to that fiftieth anniversary reunion a couple of years ago now.  And one girl came up to me and said you remember you used to sit on my stoop before you got, caught the bus.  I couldn't remember.  And of course I said why yes?  I mean why would I not tell her yes?  At that--you know I told Payne, I said I tell you know I'm just blank here.  But you asked me those friends, Eli was one.  He was the first one and that's why I think we remained friends forever because of being (unclear) there we didn't know anybody else basically but each other.  I had a few other people because I had met the kids who were in the Jack and Jill so I would know some of those persons but they weren't all in my class at any one time.  So you had a few, just a few.  Marsha Mills she is now and she married another minister's son, Damon Mills and they are together in California.  But we became very close friends in high school, in junior high school.
Story_ID: 10310
Speaker 1: Speaking of high school, what was the name of your high school and what were those years like?
Speaker 2: Frederick Douglass High School [Baltimore, Maryland] and they were great.  They could have been better I know, but I was not allowed to date so I don't say great the way a lot of people might.  But I had fun because I was beginning to feel even more independent.  They had lots of different clubs and I joined a number of them.  Again, you did those little clubs in between times and all.  I was beginning to get to stay a little later because then I could get home as long as, not during the winter when the days were short but during the spring and fall I could stay later for things and do things after school and then get home.
Speaker 1: And what kinds of activities were you involved in, in high school?
Speaker 2: Well you know mostly athletic kinds of things, the volleyball and the basketball.  We took swimming at the YMCA and I'd go do that.  Then we had, we--I was a member of the, I was always a member of somebody's honor society.  They met and we had some of the social service groups that were around, were affiliated with the YW, that was a big thing.  The YW isn't as big in school even when my daughter came through as they, it was before.  And so Y teams was, was big.
Speaker 1: And what kind of young lady were you developing into?
Speaker 2: Well I became early on a tomboy and stayed a tomboy.  When there would be little Jack and Jill picnics and you'd pick up sides and you would play you know and you'd play touch football and you'd go around and touch, the little girls would go oh, you know, I was the one running and touching.  Consequently I taught my daughters [Therese & Hillary Lucas] about, listen.  I was always the, the lanky, the athletic, not really--I wasn't built athletically, but those kinds of things I tended to do.  I could climb a tree.  Well we had all those trees out there and if I was going to have anybody to play with I'd better climb.
Speaker 1: Who were some of your teachers in high school?
Speaker 2: Oh, Mr. (Taft?) Scott I won't forget.  He was our Latin teacher and I've often wondered whether the gentlemen who is the basketball coach that was here then went down to, did he go to, where did he go North Carolina?  Where did he go?  I don't know, whether that was his son or not because he looks very much like him.
Speaker 1: Why did you like him so much?
Speaker 2: And if not son, it could have been grandson really.
Speaker 1: Why did you like him so much?  Why, why--?
Speaker 2: You know I guess because he--well a black man standing up there teaching Latin, always just amazed me.  And he did it in such a way as to not only create the interest in it and keep us going but you know he doesn't poke fun.  None of our teachers--well some of them but they weren't necessarily fun-fun.  You knew that that was the teacher and you were the student.  Nowadays I walk into a classroom and I have from time to time with certain groups and I'm not sure whose the teacher and whose the student you know because they all dress alike, this absolutely was not the case.  Shirt, tie up to here you know, whatever always.  And always it would be Miss Hill, take your seat.
Story_ID: 10311
Speaker 1: Were you thinking about going to college at this time and--?
Speaker 2: I always knew I was going to college.  I grew up on a campus and that was a given.
Speaker 1: Did you have dreams and aspirations?
Speaker 2: You've asked me that and I guess--(simultaneously).
Speaker 1: In high school did you?
Speaker 2: In high school were they developing?  You know I had no big dreams.  I, I was not going out to save the world.  I didn't know--.
Speaker 1: So how did you--?
Speaker 2: --about the world to be saved and I was very protected.  I think about those days and I was just before the, the sit-ins, I was just in the group before you know--Baltimore [Maryland] was big on these things, but this happened just after I had left Morgan [State College, now University, Baltimore, Maryland], when Morgan students had started sitting in at the canteen in--not canteen, what do you call it, Hechts [department store], little counter, little refreshment counter and stopped, started boycotting in the little shopping center near Morgan.  Well that happened after I had left by a year.
Speaker 1: How did you make the decision to got to [University of] Maryland Eastern Shore [Princess Anne, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Oh that was--.
Speaker 1: And what year was it?
Speaker 2: I went to [University of] Maryland Eastern Shore in '58 [1958], September of '58 [1958].  And it was only because I had applied to teach at Morgan and they refused to hire me.  They refused because they thought it would not be good to have two parents already on the staff and one specifically in the area of physical education, that that possibly wasn't the best thing.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry Ms. Lucas, let's go back to college. So tell me a little bit about how you made the decision about where you would go to college and what those years were like.
Speaker 2: Now those were years that were wonderful years and possibly because I then began to get, to be a little bit older.  They were allowing me a little more opportunity to do things.  I lived at home still.  It was, the decision was sort of handed to me.  At that time in Baltimore, in Maryland and perhaps other states, if you selected a major that was not a major at Morgan, Bowie [State University], Maryland State--Eastern Shore, what other, can't think of any other black college.  Was that college there?  Can't think of any other, any other black colleges, they would pay your tuition, room and board to send you away from Maryland.  So many of my friends went to, to many schools and you would find them coming up with you know airplane technology, I don't know.  You know anything that, engineering, Morgan wasn't teaching engineering at the time, anything just to have their college education paid for.  I wanted to go to Wellesley [College].  There's a long story behind that because that's one of the places my mother should have gone when she finished Oberlin [College] to teach and that job was handed to someone else.  So I always wanted to go to Oberlin--to Wellesley. And my dad [Talmadge Layman Hill] said he was not going to even assist in any of the additional costs because I could go to Morgan and get this education right there, you know.  But more than anything he said that I was sixteen and that I should take two years at least at this black school because the friends I'd make at a black school--and he did allow that I could go to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.]--that the friends that you'd make at a black school would be friends that you'd have for the rest of your life.  He said so you know after two years if you still feel this strongly then we'll look at sending you to another school.  Of course at the end of two years I had all my friends, I was entrenched where I was and, and so I stayed where I was.  I, I really feel as I told my husband that I had no calling out there.  And no one was pushing me to do anything in particular.  In fact, my grandmother's expected that I would probably find a husband, marry and not work again.  And that's sort of something in the back of my mind that I had heard and they felt, my grandparents were very involved on both sides, that they had kept us, especially me protected enough that I should never be out in the "real world".  They didn't really want me out there.  They would probably say, "Did she know that?"  That's what they're saying to each other up there.  But you know, and you get kids can hear things or feel things and figure them out and I thought my brother [Talmadge L Hill Jr.] was the one who always wanted to be the lawyer so I thought, go to law school.  Not me, but for him.  And he would end up going to law school.  I think deep down and I don't know if Payne [Lucas] even knows this, he may know it but the one thing I really wanted to do that I didn't do and was on my track to doing it but for one thing was go to med[ical] school.  And I had all but four hours in biology to do that.
Story_ID: 10312
Speaker 1: So Ms. Lucas we were talking about, you were thinking about going to medical school.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: What year was this and what happened?
Speaker 2: Well actually it was in the fall of nineteen, 1955.  I finished in June, '56 [1956].  It would have been the fall when a lot of people were getting applications together to submit them for graduate school.  And my good friend Eli Saunders and I had said--well Eli had always talked about going to med school from the day I met him until he's become a physician.  And he had said--well you know, we had most of our classes together anyhow you know we'll go to med school.  So we both applied to University of Maryland and YU was another one that I had applied to, I think just those two.  And I was also one of a group of people that Morgan [State College, now University, Baltimore, Maryland] had identified in our freshman year as hopefully other black institutions did and hopefully they still do, by means of our aptitude scores on whatever tests they give, they gave them and they give now.  And we were worked with say once a month by various professors about challenging us into things that we could do when we left Morgan.  And out of this group you know we had Fulbright Scholars and we had Woodrow Wilson fellows and, and all sorts of people.  And one of the names I put down on the list if we could get to him, he's in a wheelchair but still living was our Fulbright advisor at Morgan who had been recognized in the late '50s [1950s], early '60s [1960s] as having the most Fulbright students of any black school.  And I think it would be interesting as to how he got involved in that, how--he became very active in the whole Fulbright program after the fact as he became--left Morgan and then they sort of tapped him to work--(unclear)(simultaneously).
Speaker 1: So you received a Fulbright scholarship?
Speaker 2: So I received a Fulbright from Morgan.  I went to the University of Oslo in Norway.
Speaker 1: What year was this?
Speaker 2: '56 [1956]--'57 [1957].  I left on June 10th, graduated on June 6th, left on June 10th.
Story_ID: 10313
Speaker 1: And what was your experience like abroad?
Speaker 2: As with college, I, I learned one thing, people are just alike everywhere but our experience started with the boat when we left.  We went by ship over and, and other Fulbright students were going to other places in Norway and/or other places in Scandinavia.  If they didn't get a ship going directly to, to, to Sweden they might stop in Norway and then go on to Sweden or something.  Anyway, so our experience started on shipboard so by the time we got to--and I met another good friend at that time that we became close friends.  And it was a, and we became close by the time we got to Norway, went for the summer program and then the rest of the season, the rest of the academic year.  I stayed, we stayed in what they called "studentbyen(s)" which was a student hotel basically, student apartments, I'll put it that way, in one section of Oslo.  And you took a tram which was your streetcar there and you had your own little city, and byen means city, so it was a student city, wonderful place to be, fantastic.  I mean just all youths, I mean just exhuberent and what have you.  And the, the Fulbright program personnel in Norway did not have us stay in the same apartments together so we were split up everywhere.  There were five people to an apartment in this studentbyen.  We had small rooms with daybeds and we had one larger room as a kitchenette.  And between two sections of the apartment was the common area which proved to be the living room or so and then at the back of that living room area you had your shower on one side and your toilet, they were always separate, on the other.  And you'd come out to one telephone and you'd pick up the phone.  Well I got there and I tell you, most people spoke English but not my roommates.  Not anybody spoke English so there I was and I tell you, I could not take it.  And I would go across the hall where there would be another Fulbright student in another apartment and everybody spoke English over there and I'd come back and I'd go into the common room and I'd have to have my ordbok, which was a dictionary, out and I was struggling through this.  I came in one day and I said, "Gee I am picking up on my Norwegian.  And I looked up and I said wait a minute, I'm listening too much.  And I--and this girl was just rattling away in English on the phone to somebody in either Sweden or Denmark or somewhere and I just stood there.  And so when she got off, she finished this conversation which was about inviting somebody to come--she had happened to have been the president of a council--they didn't have a president of the student body.  They had, already had a president of an organization and they voted a president so they were called president of a council president, that's what she was.  And she was arranging for something.  And anyhow she got off the phone and called the others that were there into the kitchen, 'cause you could get your coffee and they had this big laugh at my expense.  They had all along been able to speak English and understand everything I said about them.  But they said they did it to help me learn it quicker, Norwegian quicker.  And if they allowed me to learn their language then maybe towards the end I would give them some of the colloquialisms that we had in our language.  But they had made a pact that they were going to see if they could keep from, you know, slipping and speaking English so that I would have to speak Norwegian.  And come to tell you that I learned Norwegian better than the people who went there in the language who were taking you know another kind of Nordic this, that or the other.  We had one of these little brainy kids from Harvard [University] on this (unclear) oh and he just knew so much on the boat.  I can remember him.  I thought, oh god is this what it's going to be like.  And he, what he knew and he had been practicing his Norwegian and what not and of course you know I had a dram of, of Norwegian [laughs].  And then we had people who were from the Midwest who themselves had family, knew some Norwegian anyhow.  And I, I learned skol [cheers] quick.  But to make a long story short, I have never appreciated any effort more than the effort they did because I did learn to even tell jokes in Norwegian.
Story_ID: 10314
Speaker 1: So let's talk about your years at [University of] Maryland Eastern Shore [Princess Anne, Maryland].
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: What year did you go there to teach and--(simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: I was there in '58 [1958] by way of having picked up a masters at Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania] , a scholarship from them.  And that's why I didn't go on to med school because I, I was already that far ahead I felt in a career and short sighted in terms of the fact that I could have started at any point along the line and gone on.  So that's I guess in my mind while it is something back there I've always wanted to do.  And Payne [Lucas, husband] even at one point he may know, gave me the opportunity when I was at the Penney Company to, to make a decision about going on back to school that we could probably afford to do that if that's what I wanted to do.  And I of course again was not that driven and didn't take him up on that and said oh it's too late and you know why don't I just do these kinds of things.  And I had gotten into some interesting things there so that makes--(unclear)(simultaneously).
Speaker 1: So you did meet your husband at--?
Speaker 2: At Maryland State [now University of Maryland Eastern Shore], very well done.  And he was a returning senior or, yeah he was a senior the year I met him.  He had been in the Air Force and had interrupted his career, his education to go into the air force and then he came back after four years and was completing it.  And I was told by several young professors, not young professors, young assistants, staff on the campus, oh you got to meet this guy whose a graduating senior, etc., etc.  Well I said, I see.  Oh they've got to be kidding I thought to myself.  And since we were right down there with nothing else to do we chaperoned all the dances and what not and that's where I met him at one of the dances.  And he came over, introduced himself, asked me to dance and so we danced.  And one of the things that I remembered was that he--I had asked him about himself and he had no problem.  I said and where are you from and not only did he give me where he was from he told me about his mother or his siblings, his dad, what they did, where they had been, where they hoped to go and all of this business, all of this (unclear).  But of course somebody was playing, a band was playing so that went on for a while so that's when I met him.  The next time I saw Payne was at a, at an induction into Alpha, Alpha Gamma--what is it?  I've forgotten the names of the honor societies now, the general honor society.  And they had those people on staff to come and participate if we were members already.  I hadn't been a member Alpha Kappa (unclear) Alpha Gamma (unclear), I can't even think of it anymore that's terrible.  It wasn't Beta Kappa Chi and it wasn't Phi Beta Kappa, it wasn't--well anyway so we had to interrogate them on papers they had to write and I have to admit the paper he wrote was something on Africa.  And I remember saying oh let me look at this one.  There were two or three guys and read through this paper.  Well then we had to ask them questions and Payne would, of the three of them, Payne would ask--be asked a question by someone else and he would answer it and other guys, etc.  And when I asked him a question he would look at me as if to say, what is this physical education teacher asking me a question about whatever I was asking?  Well of course I sat on the other side and I said, "This nigger thinks he's not going to answer this question.  I am just going to keep at--and I just kept badgering him back with questions."  Finally, he decided that you know his body attitude, he finally turned around as if let me get this over with and he would say dadah-dadah, you know which is all he had to do in the first instance you know.  I was so pissed I didn't know what to say.  So afterwards we had a little punch and crackers and cookies and something and we chit-chatted and then we were disbanding and I was headed back up to the campus room that I had when he walks up to me and said can I walk you to your room, back to your dorm or building?  And I said I'm headed this way if that's the way you're going you may join me, you know, kept walking.  That's how it started.  And he got halfway up there and he says you know one day I'm going to marry you and I said you have--this is what I said it to his face.  I said you have got to be kidding.  So who had the last laugh?  I went back I said you cannot believe that this guy is a senior, has not even begun to think about what he's going to be doing and has asked me to, no told me he was going to marry me.  Yeah, so that's how that, that's the other part of that story.
Story_ID: 10315
Speaker 1: And tell me a little bit about your experience after you left [University of] Maryland Eastern Shore [Princess Anee, MAryland]?
Speaker 2: Wow, let's see.  I stayed there four years because I was a believer that you start something and you sort of see your class through. So the class of '58 [1958] I saw through to '62 [1962].  I had great experiences there and indeed I was nominated by the dean and the faculty for a Danforth grant and was interviewed with I don't know how many other people here in Washington, D.C.  The dean came up here with me.  He and the other deans of whomever else came with their candidates, met with various people and then we met with various people and then I was fortunate enough to receive a Danforth.  So I had, I had wonderful relations with my associates there and with the students who one day, having them in the gymnasium they had a stage and I was running a little late and had a putt-putt.  My friend and I from Bermuda got putt-putt bikes [scooters] and so we were putting around campus.  That, that was much as I ever--oh I'm sorry.  That was much as we ever did out of ordinary but that was big on a very conservative campus especially with conservative blacks, you can imagine.  So I putt-putted up and got off the bike, set it up and I dash up the steps and I walk, there's not one student anywhere.  And I must have exclaimed like, oh my god or oh, something, you know.  And I said oh and I carried on a little bit then they pulled up the drapes and they were behind on the stage.  And they said "Surprise!"  You know I could have killed them because my heart had said--I could just see the, the people that, that were in the know around the campus saying, you lost your class.  But they were almost my age anyhow and it was something trying to, to be their teacher and not be their friend because it's so easy to, to go over and be a friend.  But on occasions like that they sort of let you know that hey, we're here, we know, it's all right.
Speaker 1: Tell me about the summer of 1964 that you spent at Southern University [New Orleans, Louisiana].  What was that like teaching at Southern during that, during the summer of 1964?
Speaker 2: Well it was--I went back, it's fall--not fall it was February through August, through early August, the second semester there.  Someone went out, fortunately for me, someone went out on maternity leave and I had been in Iowa and was grad--graduated in February from Iowa and it was cold.  And I had had enough of cold weather.  And I went to the, one of the offices there on the campus that helped graduates to find positions.  And there had been a woman, who I should put her name down if her name hasn't already been there, Jewel Prestige who was the youngest Ph.D. from Iowa.  Yes, University of Iowa [Iowa City, Iowa] at that time ever.  I think she was, maybe she was just twenty one having finished-- (unclear) (simultaneously).
Speaker 1: What were your experiences like on the Southern campus?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well she met me--well she called there.  They called her to find out if there were any positions.  She called back to the, the University of, of Iowa to indicate that yes by way of pregnancy and this pregnancy leave of absence there would be a position that she had learned about.  And I said I'd take it ,sight unseen or anything.  She met me at the plane when I arrived there and became a dear friend.  Her husband also a dear friend and her children have grown.  She's got large grand children now.  But I admired her because she was a woman which you need to know came from a very deprived background of a number of kids, the oldest one in her family and went on to do what I just--the youngest Ph.D. and went on to head up their department of, I want to say English but she did something other than English.  It wasn't sociology--(unclear)(simultaneously).
Speaker 1: How did you enjoy--what were--?
Speaker 2: But the people were great.  I think--what I've always had to say throughout this, I have always enjoyed the people.  When people say, ask me, well how did you like something, I always--it, it evolves to be what the relationships were with folk, just plain folk.  And if you allow people to be whomever they are, they will be.  So whether it was being in Norway or being at Penn State or Iowa or later on when I was overseas with my husband in Niger or Niger, whichever pronunciation you want, I found their students to be students, young merits to be young merits, it didn't matter.  They were just people.  And we had, I had a wonderful time in all these experiences and I, I think that's why I feel guilty because I went through a lot of this period, I went through a lot of this period in wonderful kinds of environments without much of the stress that a lot of my brothers and sisters went through.  And, and I think I feel guilty that I was not caught up in enough of this or a lot of this or any of it.  At the points where I was, it wasn't taking place.  And, and I, and back to my college days I mean I wrote a, a letter to the president at Morgan when he had thrown every sorority and fraternity off campus.  And I wrote a letter indicating that he ought not throw off those chapters that were not involved in whatever, the whole list of things, you know.  I mean that, I would do whatever happened at the time.  That happened, you reacted.  Now I don't know if some, if I would have been a Rosa Parks if they walked down and told me (unclear).  If I had been tired I'd have probably said (unclear).  In fact, that's what my parents worried about more than anything else.  They often said they could see me getting into a situation where I had been accustomed to doing something and now I'm being told not to do something.  And when I went to Southern they were truly concerned about my being at Southern cause they thought that if anything--right now things were fine for my life, that's all they're thinking about my life and was I going to survive the unrest in the states.  And they were concerned about my brother and being a black male and the fact that he, you know he was tall and all that.  We could just see his head being blown off and what not.  So when--(unclear)(simultaneously).
Speaker 1: Did you get involved in any activities like that at Southern?
Speaker 2: At Southern, no.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: No.  I was there from February to August of, February to August of '63 [1963], February '63 [1963] to August '64 [1964] because I married right after that.
Story_ID: 10316
Speaker 1: After you married your husband, C. Payne Lucas, you moved to Africa.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And what was that experience like?  Was Africa what you had expected?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  He had told me enough about Africa and I had gone back and read a lot about it and I had gotten reports from the Peace Corps to read about Africa.  It was a new experience.  Now I do like new experiences.  I enjoy whatever that is.  And I, as I said I was anxious to go and see what it was like.
Speaker 1: What did your parents think?
Speaker 2: Oh they, I had already taken a trip around the world by freighter so, so they were accustomed to my doing things you know that were unusual.  So that was, they didn't have a problem with my going.  My dad [Talmadge Layman Hill] when I had been teaching at Maryland State [College, now University of Maryland Eastern shore, Princess ANee, Maryland] had gone for the United States Information Service to, not Lesthoto, to Lorenzo Marx (ph.) and taught coaching, basketball workshops and that kind of thing and setting up their, their organization like the CIAA or MEAC, what is--yeah.  So he had done that for a year.  So he was, he knew, he had been on the continent of Africa, not necessarily where we had been, we were going or Payne had been so that was not a problem.  And I had already gone away in Norway so they had, they felt that they you know.
Story_ID: 10317
Speaker 1: And you worked for Job Corps?
Speaker 2: And when I, Payne and I came back, I looked for positions in my field so I wrote to the Department of whatever they call it, public schools and you know told them I'd make a great director of physical education.  And of course they saw--and in fact, this guy he used to run was in charge of the Department of Physical Education and Recreation.  It begins with--I can't think of, Dr. what's his name.  I can't think of it, I can see him, handsome man.  With Indian black skin and slick black hair who was really, really.  Oh I thought if kept talking his name would come to me.  It begins with an L.  I can't think of it, but anyway they said, well have you ever taught in the public school system?  You know it's one thing to teach four years and half a semester and a summer in some place but have you, you know--well do you think you, you know you've worked with this kind of--of course I didn't have the experience for that position.  But that just lets you know what I thought.  So, I--(unclear) (simultaneously).
Speaker 1: But you did go into public relations?
Speaker 2: Well I went into OEO and OEO which, was the Office of Economic Opportunity had at its helm the wife was the mayor of the District of Columbia at that time, Vanetta (ph.) Washington there, Walter Washington's first wife.  She was very much like my dad, very stern individual and no one seemed to be able to know her well.  But she did many things that were helpful to assist blacks grow, including me.  There were others but including me.  And she would ask me to sit in on meetings with her, take notes for her at meetings, that kind of thing.  Her meetings were advisory boards where they would have groups from corporations and academia and voluntary organizations discussing the programs at these women's job corps centers.  And one time she had me sit in on--and I would do that.  And one time she had me sit in on a meeting and they were dealing with the budget and where the supplies and ordering those supplies and so forth.  So I said to her, I said Dr. Washington, I said I don't think is something I, I should be sitting in on.  I could--before I could even go on, she said listen, a lot of these little white gals in here don't know a damn thing about what's going on.  They know--I said, cause I had said well I don't know what a--she said but that's how they get in here.  They put their little pencils to paper.  You don't have to say a word, put your pencil to paper, listen and learn.  And I never asked her again about the things she had asked me to do.  Then she got so that she would say, I'm not going to be able to give this speech at X, Y, Z.  Would you go there and speak on my behalf?  At one of those I met, someone came up to me who was from the JC Penny Company and we chatted.  And then I went on and caught a cab.  And someone ran up to get into this cab with me which was someone in the personnel office at OEO who said they just talked with somebody from the Penny Company who wanted my resume and data and she was headed back to get it.  And she said, and look at this, here I am in the cab with you too.  That's why I said I had to get this cab.  And I mean that just shows you how that happened.  So I got hired by the Penny Company but not after having Mr. Penny himself interview me.  So, and so I, and somewhere I have a book of his which is autographed.
Speaker 1: And you were there for almost ten years?
Speaker 2: Well not quite ten years.  About eight years.
Story_ID: 10318
Speaker 1: What was the culture like in the late 60s [1960s], early to mid 70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: Well at that time we were a small office and it was, the culture would shown me.  They brought you in here, shown me and I was again pleasantly surprised that the man who hired me who was a vice president had himself been a coach.  He had been a coach in Texas somewhere.  He had hired somebody else who had been a coach, another white guy in Utah.  I had, I've always met up with these people from different states and you know.  And, and discussing this one time I said you know I'm just interested in why you brought me aboard and basically gave me an MBA in, in what they did and how they trained you for the first six to eight months really.  I said why did you think--cause I was curious.  This is, this George Stone who had hired, basically was the one to hire me though Mr. Penny had to finally say yes or no.  And he said well I'll tell you, when I looked at that resume and I saw that your dad had been a coach and for how many years and where and that you had gone Penn State under Dr. Lowther (ph.), I, I don't know whether (unclear) I couldn't remember his name, but it's one of the names, Dr. Lowther, he said I know she's going to be a good team player.  That's what he made his decision on after of course he had been in some of the meetings I had been with Dr. Washington and he had heard me deliver whatever speech I had to deliver, etc.  And, so I've talked to groups and I've had to talk to young people and tried to explain to them you never know whose out there watching you or why.  I said and then when I got, was offered this position and they interviewed me extensively.  I met so many different groups of people.  I went there.  And so one time when they came here I said instead--my husband, they wanted my husband to join us, to join you and your wives at some, they had some meeting, I said why don't you all join us for dinner?  And so we took them to Eddie Murphy's when there was the Eddie Murphy's on Georgia Avenue.  He's not there anymore but you know and they had of course there was pig feet and, and all of the black foods were being offered on the menu.  Of course there were spare ribs which I figured they'd get spare ribs.  Well I was so surprised I must admit when not only did they take pig feet and chitlins and everything imaginable ordered you know among the group, wives included for this menu, this meal, but I just couldn't hold it back and I asked them.  I said well I have never met people who enjoyed this food so much and they didn't just pick at it, they ate it.  And if they were lying as Payne and I said they--we were flying.  But they ate it and they, they finger licking good kind.  They said look, we're from Texas.  We eat everything about the pigs and the cows that you can have so you were right down our alley.  We've been trying to find a place like this.  So that sort of helped, it sure--though I did talk with several people about joining Penny's, including the guy, Berkley Burrell (ph.) who was the president of the National Business League at that time and had a cleaners on Georgia Avenue and cause I was looking for somebody who knew something about business you see.  My granddaddy had died and my dad certainly didn't go back to run the grocery story so I did have a, a tie at home.  Then anyhow, I talked with Coontz (ph.), Elizabeth Coontz who had the NEA position at that point.
Story_ID: 10319
Speaker 1: How did you end up leaving Penny's and going to General Motors?
Speaker 2: About four years into the Penny Company I realized that I would either have to go to New York and it would have been I guess Texas where they have since moved or I would have to find another role in that company.  So I said to them that I wanted to become a lobbyist knowing full well that that would keep me in Washington.  Payne traveled quite a bit and it, we had made a pact Payne and I, that one of us would be at home.  And it looked like I would be the one, since his, he couldn't make the decision as regular and keep his career going if he said he was never going to travel.  So I said I would try to keep the home base.  At least we would be, I'd be in the same country you know and close enough to get to a school or something or other.  Anyway, again people fine and I had wonderful staff at different places who resolved lots of issues when it came to children that sometimes I never knew about.  But anyway, anyway I stayed here and they allowed me to become a lobbyist and indeed I had been so skeptical I think I voiced the fact I wasn't sure that I was going to have the opportunity to do it.  And my boss came back, this is Gene Rowan (ph.) at this point and he said, guess what, GM--GM--guess what JC Penny has decided?  We're going to make you our first lobbyist, female lobbyist.  They had had men.  He didn't say black, but I was the first black corporate lobbyist who was female here in Washington.
Story_ID: 10320
Speaker 1: Just briefly tell me how you made the transition from JC Penney's to General Motors?
Speaker 2: Oh there are so many stories I could tell you about corporate America especially in Washington, D.C.  But I will restrain myself.  But I can let you know that the Penney Company was fantastic in the opportunities they provided. The rest of the community had to sit up and take note as to what Penney's was doing and one of the best persons there that I can recall in the lily white Chamber of Commerce who befriended me from day one was the Sears Company representative and head of his office.  When I walked into an all white room for a meeting there were people who did not want you sitting by them and there were no seats otherwise not by someone.  So I took a deep breath, started to walk towards the seats when this gentleman stood up and said, "Oh Freddie come over here.  I've got a seat for you."  This was the Sears guy.  I'm representing Penney's so there wasn't anyone from Penney's.  From that moment on he seemed to let others know since, Phil Knox was his name, since he was a senior, that you know this is an open society, an inclusive one and I wanted just to comment about Phil Knox of Sears.  Anyhow then the, the General Motors Corporation decided that they had to respond across the board to an EEOC [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission] case that they had had, right, GE [General Electric], GM [General Motors] and some other group (unclear) was Westinghouse.  I don't know the other--Sears itself was one, had certain obligations that had to be fulfilled.  They had looked around and because I had been involved with the Clean Air Act on behalf of the JC Penney Company in position to much of what they were saying for the auto industry, they decided that they wanted to see who this person was.  So at an NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] dinner or yes it was an NAACP dinner, they called the Washington office of Penney's and asked if I could join them at their table.  And Penney's had to go on to the NAACP program fundraiser in New York where they were headquartered so it made sense that I wouldn't be at a Penney table.  So I did go and Payne [Lucas, husband] accompanied me.  The whole time I was basically asked questions about the Clean Air Act and I gave them down the country as to why they weren't cleaning up their cars and this, that and the other, why poor little companies like Penney's had to be where they were and struggling with pollution given off by these autos.  And so finally the one guy said, "Okay, Dr. Lucas tell us, now what do you think we should do?"  Now I knew better than trying to tell somebody in their own field what to do and I, I looked at him.  I said "Do you know something?  I have no earthly idea what you need to do.  I only know that we're not responsible," and I went back into our line.  And then it wasn't long after that, that they offered me a position and I again discussed it with not only Payne but several others and we decided, okay let's give it a try.  I was very comfortable at the Penney Company, could have stayed right there, gained much more time very quickly.  This was a reach but it was something else.  I felt that General Motors would give me the opportunity to stand solely on my own as a lobbyist.  At Penney's, they still remembered that they brought me in and they gave me about six to eight months almost MBA training so to speak and sent me to the various divisions, etc., etc.  You couldn't buy that kind of education with the, and the time and the money and the on-hand service that they gave me.  And yes, I felt a little guilty that you know after all of this and having had these opportunities, not knowing what might come in the future that people sort of laid out there for you to move over to General Motors.  But again in the back of my mind it was stay in Washington, D.C.  So I --and yet it was going to be a good, decent promotion.
Story_ID: 10321
Speaker 1: And what kinds of issues did you work on as a lobbyist?
Speaker 2: Oh, initially for the [JC] Penney Company I did environmental issues.  I didn't touch anybody's toes whatsoever.  When I went to the--and I couldn't take those issues with me because they were basically the, the opposite position to those positions at General Motors.  I used to say they did that on purpose.  But in any event I took the human resource issues and at first I said typical, I've got these human resource issues only because they're going to talk about personnel issues.  Well little did I know that after--they also gave me a few weeks of training, etc., and visits to different places, that we--I dealt with the finance committee and that most things went through the finance committee.  And I keep coming back to my good friends in the finance committee.  So I dealt with such issues as health, one of the biggest items in the company, pensions, another big issue in the company, unemployment comp.  We often had to be involved with our, our personnel being off.  The unions would take them out, all of those issues.  Plant closings, my god we started to have these plant closings.  That was one of the ugliest issues that we had to deal with.  And there were other issues also but the major money makers were the ones that I listed.
Speaker 1: What was like working on the Hill [Capitol Hill]?
Speaker 2: Oh wow, that was fine.  I had went to, back with the Penney days, went to a Clean Air meeting, I was there.  And a gal came up to me who represented the, the textile workers.  And she said, "Listen, I just want to say one thing to you," and she said, "always remember to be a lady and you will do fine on the Hill."  And then she went off her way and did her number you know and I often thought about it.  She just took me aside and said that one thing.  And it, I think it's because you go into the demographic national, the club, Democratic club or something and the guys are over here talking--they're mostly men you know they're being you know men.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But you can be a lady and you can still get your points across and you can smile and say oh no and still get your points across.
Story_ID: 10322
Speaker 1: So in your more than twenty five years of lobbying and working on--.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --working on the Hill [Capitol Hill], what are some of the biggest changes that you have noticed?
Speaker 2: Oh wow!  One, seeing so many women in roles of responsibility in the various offices and on the committees, that's the biggest.  Before it was just male dominated in terms of power, positions and female dominated in terms of the subservient roles.  It's altogether different at this point.  And the number of young people seem to be the same but the numbers of, of the sexes have evened up thank heavens.
Speaker 1: What about African Americans?  Have you seen an increase in African Americans?
Speaker 2: Not as many as I would like to see.  There, there is an increase definitely but not as many as one would expect to see.  And sometimes I think it's because the African Americans have struggled so hard to get a college education that they're ready to get out and earn a living, pay back whatever they need to pay back to their family and pay back for these student loans.  And they want to move on and get into the regular work-a-day world.  The salaries still, unless you're in a top position, are very, very small but you're there only for the experience.  And if you run with two or three people as I know folks do, you can live in a wonderful place for hardly any money but you got to be willing to share space, etc.  And there are ways to do that to get the experience.  That's the one thing that a lot of our people don't know.  And had we had the time I could have told you one assignment I had for [JC] Penney's was to work with the black managers in far out locations because these stores are in podunk places many times and to try to get black people into them means that they're going to have to leave usually another very urban area to go to a very small area.  And the adaptation for the spouse whether it's male or female is greater than it is for the person who's doing the work.  And so many times I had to specifically work with some of the ladies to talk with them about why their husbands were out learning out all these codes and what they were doing in their shelf work life and all of that, for--they'd be out from like seven a.m. or earlier to seven or eight or nine at night.  And they're sitting there in podunk with nothing to do.  And it was trying to help them understand that once they could get over this hump that things, there would be some light at the end of the tunnel that was a concern.  And it's the same thing with these young people on Capitol Hill.  If we can get our African Americans to realize if they can put a year, eighteen months to two years in, that this opens up a world of opportunity that they never otherwise might have the opportunity to experience.  Everybody doesn't start off at a top position but you can start off at a very significant and, position in terms of the future.
Story_ID: 10323
Speaker 1: And during this time your husband [C. Payne Lucas] was also leading a very prominent career--.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --heading Africare.  How were you balancing you know the work life issues especially since your husband was traveling--.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --out of the country so much?  How were you balancing that?
Speaker 2: Well staying busy always helped.  I think that had a lot to do with it.  We always talked about what we were able to do and what might not be--we might not be able to do also.  We tried to get them in decent schools and I had them in Catholic schools because of other Peace Corps people.  Dale Lewis, and my husband  may have mentioned this, got us into the first elementary school that our children went to.  We learned that that was a--had enough structure that was good for them because so many places have (unclear).  So you go around and you think my god how can they even concentrate on something when indeed they need a little bit more structure and they can have less structure when they get out of here.  Anyway, it wasn't as difficult as I think about it now as I look back as it was going through it.  But it's over with so you think no it wasn't so bad because you got through it.  But it takes a lot of coordination.  And I like to feel that many times I was working to pay the baby sitter.  We had someone live in five days a week and they would probably be gone on the weekend but could stay the weekend but were not responsible for the children.  That allowed me with the late hours, both at the [JC] Penney Company and at General Motors if I could not get home because there were breakfasts to be to, there were dinners and receptions to go to and you just couldn't up and leave.  And many times we were planning them.  I had planned a lot of those for people and had people come in from out of town to attend these meetings so our schedules were just hectic like that.  We were very fortunate with the babysitters that we had and one from another family member who came and stayed with the--that, one of those things.  So it was not someone they were not aware of generally speaking.  We had our disasters too.  We had someone that I got from a very reputable source, an aunt of this particular woman who headed up a national organization who was an alcoholic.  And when we discovered all sorts of bottles in the room, the day she came back my husband met her at the door with bags packed and bus fare home with a two week salary.  She never came back into the house.  This other woman, the niece called me and said you could have told me.  I said listen it was too late then but if anyone should have told anything, you should have let me know she had a problem.  But we had remained friends you know and all, but that was an experience that we didn't--you know cut your losses as soon as you can once we found that out.  We don't know what might happen.  She might be out of it and the kids light a fire somewhere.  I mean you know, you think of the worst scenario and all.  But otherwise we had some people who were very good.  In fact I said hmm, has she taken my place?  That's how good they can be.  But the children know who mom and dad happen to be and I give Payne a lot of credit because he spent some time with them when he was here.  The weekends were just totally devoted to them and thank God we didn't have the beepers and the, and cell phones that we do now have because we could get away on, over the weekend and there would be people on call and he would check in perhaps from time to time.  But there were, we would--you name every ride up and own the East coast we'd been there.
Story_ID: 10324
Speaker 1: And how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: It would be just great to be remembered.  Just to be remembered as someone who has perhaps been a loving and loyal wife, who has been a caring and devoted mother, who has, whose been a real friend to people who she considers or I consider to be, them to be my friends, that I have tried to give when I could and to share what I had and to just be me.  And I've allowed--and not allowed, I've said to people after they have come into my home that the latch key stays on the outside, just use it.  If we don't bring you to our home, that's something else.  But I don't have to say that.  But they bring people into our home it's to enjoy this.  And if [C.] Payne [Lucas, husband] showed you any of the pictures we'd had ambassadors and their wives.  And we've had the, the limo driver and his wife, you know what I mean.  So if you come you may find all sorts of people mingling around together but one thing we've learned that some of those limo drivers for some of these countries come back next time as ambassadors.  They're here learning the language. So you never know who's out there and this goes for where you are at any time.
Story_ID: 10325
Speaker 1: And what do you think about your husband's [C. Payne Lucas] work with Africare, his legacy with Africare?
Speaker 2: Listen, he's got a legacy that, that's--that's one in a million.  People could not, would kill for it but they couldn't ever get it because they're not him.  He's--you've heard this probably from numbers of others but he's a very special person.  Only thing I've said about him, you either like him or you'd hate him and I've always said thank god most people like him.  But he will tell you exactly what's on his mind and he doesn't sugar coat it.  It's very factual and you can take it to the bank.  And if that's what you want to hear, then ask.  If you don't want to hear that, don't ask.
Speaker 1: Did he change your perception or ideals of what Africa is like?
Speaker 2: Probably so but I, I don't know that I had the romantic view.  Because in his letters to me he always talked about the, you know there's no romantic view here.  Tarzan's not swinging from trees and this kind of thing.  So I sort of knew that was the case.  But recall I had taken this trip around the world by freight and one of the places we stopped was in Egypt.  Of course Egypt you know you say we (unclear) talk about Egypt and it's the Northern most and, and you think--oh and we also stopped at Algiers.  But, but see I had felt the climate and I had lived abroad and I knew that you're either going to have snow eight months of the year or you'll have sun twelve months of the year.  I mean the other thing would be the people and I come back to that because you can be anywhere and survive if you're enjoying being with the people you're with.  You can make everything else happen and that includes in Africa.  We had the most wonderful life in Africa.  We had a boy that French call servants, boy, cause they usually are boys and we could never do that.  And while we were providing a family through this gentleman, you see how I say, with--he was old enough to be somebody's grandfather, with, with a livelihood, we knew it was taking care of him and many, many others, I always called him Motha, Mot--Motega, Motela, Motela (ph.) by his name.  He has a name, you know you can still have someone help you and call them by their name.  They are somebody.  Well, you do that and you finally impress other people that you can do that.  It's all right to do that.  And we would bring all sorts of people in and one time we had a--no Japanese were there but we had a Japanese, dress like a Japanese-any-way-you-can party, sat on the floor, had our, our what do you call the sticks, the chopsticks and what have, rice and what have, had a great time.  Then another time we had--one thing I do admit that we had I wish we had not had now was very bad of me.  We had a bonfire.  You know wood was scarce in some places.  But I was not really, truly thinking.  When Payne got home I already had my bonfire built so we went ahead with the bonfire but it was something I would--we never did again.  But I didn't get taken to task for it at that point and I, I regret having done that.  But generally speaking I worked with the administrator of Niger and we put on various field meets and I mean you take what you have.  Plus I had classes for, fitness classes we called them now.  We called them exercise classes then, but I couldn't get the African ladies to join in the classes with the people they called Westerners, the Westerners.  So I had to have two different classes because the African ladies did not want to disrobe in front of the Westerners.  But they would disrobe with me and just them.  So we did that so I had those kinds of classes.

Speaker 1: Of all your accomplishments, which are, what are you most proud of?
Speaker 2: What am I most proud of?  I think, I--you know this is going to sound strange but the day that my son [C. Payne Lucas Jr.] walked down the aisle of the University of Baltimore [Baltimore, Maryland] and got his diploma after a very checkered career was the day I felt most proud.  I said we've gotten our oldest child educated.  He has a way to fend for himself other than by natural wits and charm, which he has.  But I knew he had something he could take the bank.  And I've been pleased to say he's, he's been doing that which is fine.  That's one of the things that, that thrills me.  I've talked early on about rearing children and you wonder had I been at home and not had babysitters and I did everything, would we have had a teenage you know experience with our son that we had?  I mean everything we thought he should do, he wanted to do the other.  We knew what his academic life was like and what he could do and he chose to do it only when he absolutely had to and that irritated me.  When his sister got a degree from college ahead of him, that's truly what inspired him.  Said let me go back here and get this degree.  And not only did he go to University of Baltimore but he, just to finish as quickly as he could, he took courses at the University of Maryland and, and Morgan State, went to them all so he could get out.  He was working around the clock so he could finish which showed us that if he really wanted to do it, whatever, he could do it.  And so that's one thing.  The, the other is seeing Hillary [Lucas] come into her own.  Our daughter has felt that she was the, not the pretty one and she's beautiful I think.  But we went through a period of time where she thought she was the ugliest person and then she got a skin color thing going and she'd say that I, and you know I'm not, if I am you are, was light and she was dark, her brother was--I said where are you getting this from?  Look at the whole family you know.  But she's gotten over that thank god.  We've gone through the black is beautiful phase with her.  And it's not, it was a whole group of people that just, one of those things that somehow we've got to un--help our kids know that color really doesn't exist.  And you've got to deal with whatever it is you happen to be because I've seen some girls like the one I mentioned to you that went, that looked just like white and could have passed if she wanted and chose not to, who had all sorts of problems.  So you know this is just a lot of stuff that I'm, I'm hoping--I don't think we're through and beyond it, that we did get beyond it.  But I've seen her grow to get the position that she had at the White House and to do what she had been doing.  She can walk into stores in antique shops and places now and spiel off these names of I don't know what.  These artists with you know, Spanish speaking or Italian speaking names and (unclear) they come right off her lips and oh, look there's a--I don't know what heck she's talking about.  But we look at it and she explains it and, and that always intrigues whomever is in the store.  Is it over?  I'm finished.  But whomever is in the antique shop or whatever to say well where did you learn this or how do you know this?  And then she says, well I bought for the President and his wife their gifts for foreign leaders, etc., and had to take care of those, and she did.  I mean thousands of dollars for a gift for someone and--or there was something that someone would suggest to her and it was too much she would write them to say I'm sorry.  So I see, I saw her get that and to perform beautifully in that position.  And then I've seen her come back and take a position now that that administration is out, in another area in the hotel business and seen her grow in that.  So when you look back that's my legacy.  You want to know the final and third person we've not talked about is Therese Raymonde Lucas.  And while she was expected not to live the first hour, she's still with us today.  And Payne says will probably see us into the grave.  So we--while she, as long as she keeps with her air and keeps slowing down her--and keeps her pace fairly slow, we can, we can handle that, so those three are the legacies.  Two of them, one is expecting a child, my son and his wife and she has had a son. So we see that you know it will go on.  That's it.
