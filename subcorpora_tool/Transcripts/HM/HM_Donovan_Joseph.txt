Story_ID: 304488
Speaker 1: Now I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Phillip James Donovan] side and we'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes.  She was Willie, W-I-L-L-I-E, Virginia, like the state, Jones, J-O-N-E-S.
Speaker 1: All right, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born--some people are still debating and disputing, but she was born in 1908 in Sussex County, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right now what do you know about your mother's side of the family in terms of the ancestors?  First of all, how far back can you trace the ancestors on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: Well I had an Aunt Ninny [Watkins (ph.)] who was my mother's aunt, my great-aunt, who was keeper of the family Bible, in which was annotated the births, the dates, the places.  So that even if the courthouse burned down, we knew who we were.  She was with us for, until age 108 in Petersburg, Virginia.
Speaker 1: You know that's the historic site of the siege of Richmond [sic. siege of Petersburg], where black soldiers, you know, played an important role in that siege and--
Speaker 2: You betcha.  And I learned some of that from Aunt Ninny, among other important things, like the date of my mother's birth.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the last battle of the Civil War--Petersburg.  Okay, so how far back can she trace your family?
Speaker 2: Oh man, Aunt Ninny could take us all the way back in 19--from 1979, 1978 when she was 101 years old, back to her birth date.
Speaker 1: So--but how far though did the Bible trace the family--I mean history?  Did she--
Speaker 2: Well on my mother's side there.
Speaker 1: Yeah on your mother's side.  How, how far back could she go to--
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-eight [1978], she could go back to 1878.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Aunt Ninny could (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, so there's no, there's no record going past 1878.
Speaker 2: Not that I know of, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there a tradition in your family that your, your family were slaves or free or, or any stories about the Civil War or Reconstruction?
Speaker 2: Not that I paid a lot of attention to.  But yeah, there is some recognition that there was such a thing as a Civil War.  And that on my father's side--
Speaker 1: Well let's not--I want to stick to your mother's side first and then we'll go to your father's side.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: But on your, on your mother's side is there any stories about whether her people were slave or free or what occupations they had?
Speaker 2: No, they were, as far as I can recall, were not slaves, but they were agrarians, they were farmers on my mother's side.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right so there's no tradition of them having been freed from slavery or anything like that they--
Speaker 2: No, but some of my mother's brothers were sharecroppers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Whether or not their fathers had been slaves, I do not know.
Story_ID: 304489
Speaker 1: Did your mother grow up in Petersburg [Virginia] herself?
Speaker 2: Yes, until about age sixteen when she left Virginia, Suffolk County [sic. Sussex County, Virginia], and went to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Now did she talk about growing up in Petersburg, what it was like in Petersburg (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no.  She wanted to put all of that behind her.  So when she went to Philadelphia, she didn't wanna be Willie Virginia [Jones] anymore.  She wanted to be W. Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay, so I take it she had some schooling in Petersburg, and--
Speaker 2: Oh indeed she did.  Mom, as she told me years later, went to sixth grade formally.
Speaker 1: And that was all in Petersburg?
Speaker 2: Well I prefer to say Sussex County.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause it was, yeah--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I'm not sure that it was Petersburg.  Oh, it was Yale (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, around--Yale, Virginia?
Speaker 2: Yale, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Sussex County.
Speaker 1: Okay Yale, Virginia.
Speaker 2: Yale.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was anything but (laughter).
Speaker 1: So she, so she had aspirations, you know, to--above being, you know, involved in farm life and that sort of--
Speaker 2: Indeed, indeed, indeed.  As a matter of fact, when she went to Philadelphia, she was kind of adopted by a physician, whose name I can't recall.  But I know of him.  And she was nanny and housekeeper, loved his library.
Speaker 1: Now was this a black physician?
Speaker 2: Yes sir.
Speaker 1: All right.  And so you've forgotten his name at this point?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't recall his name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I once knew it, but it wasn't all that important.  What was more important to me was her residency and work with them.  Her interest in the library.
Speaker 1: So what did she end up doing for a living?
Speaker 2: What did black females do?  She didn't become a teacher, she was--became a seamstress.  Demonstrated amply during the Second World War [World War II, WWII], in the war effort.  She sewed uniforms and neckties.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When the war was ended, she said, "I don't want to or need to scrub anybody's floors for a living anymore."  And so she (laughter) went full into her seamstress talent discovered.  She made slipcovers for sofas and chairs and she made garments and she bought crepe paper and made flowers, carnations for Mother's Day (laughter), gladiola, such.
Story_ID: 304490
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  And part of this is still in dispute, too, but I always knew him as James Phillip Donovan.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His place of birth was Dover [Delaware], no not Dover.  Georgetown, Delaware.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: On the 29th of May of 1910.
Speaker 1: Okay, and--
Speaker 2: Now his given name was Phillip James [Donovan], and many people referred to him even until today as Phil.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he liked James Phillip, J.P. Donovan, if you will.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what do you know about the ancestors on your father's side?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Through my father's mother.
Speaker 1: So through--back to your grandmother [Estella West Hayman].
Speaker 2: Yes, my grandmother.  The other lady who I didn't yet refer to was my great-grandmother on this side of the family.  We'll probably get to that.
Speaker 1: Well, yes, is that, is that the farthest back you can go, your great-grandmother on your, on your father's side?
Speaker 2: On my father's side, yes.  I can go back to my great-grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know her name?
Speaker 2: Yes.  She was Agnes, A-G-N-E-S, Agnes Roberts that was her married name, not her maiden name.  She was a lady who was the teacher of English in Camden Normal [Training] School [Camden, New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Her husband was Amos Roberts.
Speaker 1: Now what's the story on her family?  Are there, are there any stories about--I mean how far back do they go?  I mean in terms of--
Speaker 2: Oh, my Lord.
Speaker 1: Had the family always been in New Jersey or had they--
Speaker 2: Well they--
Speaker 1: Or Delaware or had--'cause I know--we know there was slavery in Delaware.
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah, but they were not slaves in Delaware.  When they left Delaware they went to Camden, New Jersey.  And there my great-grandfather met my great-grandmother in Camden.  And she was from--
Speaker 1: Was he from Delaware, too?
Speaker 2: No, no.  They were as I recall, always northeast coasters.  Great-grandmother grew up within and derived from a family of educators, which is how she became later teacher of English at Camden Normal School.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which was then itself segregated.
Speaker 1: All right, so she was a black teacher in a segregated school?
Speaker 2: Yes she was (laughter).  Short, little tiny woman with tight hair.  When I knew her, it was graying, but it was not yet white.  But in that lady's small stature was a heart of a giant, wonderful woman.
Speaker 1: Now how far back does she go?  I mean what would you project would be her birthday?
Speaker 2: I wouldn't know.  I wouldn't even hazard to project, but let's see.  I was eleven years old when she died at age eighty-seven.  So very much in control of her mental faculties.
Speaker 1: So 18--late 1840s [sic. 1860] I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I would, yeah I would agree with that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, late 1840s (unclear).
Speaker 2: I could count the numbers but I, I didn't pursue mathematics, I pursued (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Well some, anybody, any scholar looking at this or any, anybody who can count can probably figure out (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh certainly.
Speaker 1: --from what you said.  If she died when you were eleven, you were born in 1936.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: That would be 1947.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And she was eighty-seven, so we, we're looking at 1840 I guess, right?  Eighteen forty [1840] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes, somewhere in there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, for her birthday.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 304491
Speaker 1: Where did she [Donovan's paternal great-grandmother, Agnes Roberts] go to school to get the kind of education that it would take to teach at--?
Speaker 2: I really have no idea precisely, but I know that some assistance was given to some members of my family on my father's [Phillip James Donovan] side, through the Quakers.  And my father's mother, my grandmother, was a servant in the Haddon, H-A-D-D-O-N, Haddon household in Haddonfield, New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The town was named for them I suppose (laughter)?
Speaker 2: You betcha.  Yes, Haddonfield was named for them and they resided in Haddon Heights.
Speaker 1: That's H-A-D-D-O-N.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay Haddon Heights in Haddonfield.
Speaker 2: Yes sir.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they were among the most wealthy in--
Speaker 1: So this was your, this was your great-grandmother that worked for them?
Speaker 2: No, that was my grandmother.  That was my father's mother who served in the Haddon household.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You were asking about the education, where did my great-grandmother, where was she educated.  And that was long before my father's mother came.  My understanding was that there was a great deal of help in educating some among us by the Quakers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Some people still refer to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] as Quaker town (laughter), which it once was.
Speaker 1: Quakers were very much involved in the Underground Railroad, and--
Speaker 2: Indeed, indeed.
Speaker 1: --In black education.
Speaker 2: Indeed. Um-hm. Raising the standard and keeping and protecting the lives.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any stories about all this interaction with the Haddons that are passed down?
Speaker 2: Oh yes sir, sir.  My father's mother, Estella [West Hayman].
Speaker 1: E-S-T-E-L-L-A?
Speaker 2: Yes sir.  Hayman, H-A-Y-M-A-N, her married name.  Her maiden name if there's any interest was West.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: W-E-S-T.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the Underground Railroad some years ago when I was doing a television show in Philadelphia called 'Black Edition,' there was a lot of concern that due to some gentrification, the station of the Underground Railroad might be co-opted and destroyed.
Speaker 1: One of the stations, you're saying.
Speaker 2: One of the stations, 5th [Street] and Lombard Streets in Philadelphia, which also was right around the corner from Mother Bethel [A.M.E.] Church [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Now is this the station that William Still operated out of (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes sir.
Speaker 1: All right.  We interviewed [HistoryMaker] Charles Blockson four years ago, very much involved.
Speaker 2: Indeed, Charles Blockson was on our show as well.
Story_ID: 304492
Speaker 1: Now what happened, it was in jeopardy of being torn (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.  There were some people who were pretty much in favor of taking over, buying out or running people out of Mother Bethel [A.M.E.] Church [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's--now the property is--tell us, it's situated close to the water, right?  It's not too far from the water.
Speaker 2: Not too far from the water.  Not too far from the Delaware River, about five blocks west of the Delaware River.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Underground Railroad building is a house?
Speaker 2: No, it's a, it's a location because at that--I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: There's nothing right now?  At 5th [Street] and Lombard [Street].
Speaker 2: There is a historical marker there (laughter).  But, as I understood it, when the railroad operated, the station was not a building as such.  It was a place where people got off of the Underground Railroad and found refuge in open homes where they could be fed and clothed and seen, and protected.  'Cause many of them, if you recall, and I'm sure that you do, ran away from with the aid of some other people who thought this is not right, referring to slavery, enslavement and such.  And so many of them were conductors on the Underground Railroad.  The rail, the path to freedom.
Speaker 1: So, some of your family members were involved in the Underground Railroad?
Speaker 2: Yes sir, yes sir.  Some of them were beneficiary of that, okay.  They were protected.  They were no longer in slavery, they tasted freedom.  They got educations, became in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and Camden, New Jersey, among the educators and the writers and so on, and so on.  So on my father's [Phillip James Donovan] side of the family, there was more knowledge and appreciation for education and the arts.  On my mother's [Willie Virginia Jones] side of the family there was a great appreciation for the environment and the soils and the--
Speaker 1: Now who are some of the people on your father's side that were involved in education?  You just give some of the names and--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well I told you his grandmother's name, Agnes [Roberts]--it's gone from me that quickly.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Roberts.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Other than she, there weren't that many.  Her, her husband, [Amos] Roberts, could only fulfill his aspirations in education by being the choir master at the church (laughter), superintendent of the Sunday school.  But at that time he was not invited nor welcomed by the educational institutions at that time.  He was a bright man, he was a brilliant man.  And the one thing that he always used to say, and I'll never forget it.  Every time we would visit them, and we did that often, he would say, "Learn all you can."  And if we told him we did or we would, he never asked to see the report card.  He would listen to you and know that you somehow got something.
Story_ID: 304493
Speaker 1: Now, did your father [Phillip James Donovan] talk about growing up in, in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and what it was like for him?
Speaker 2: Well, yes.  Actually he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or Camden [New Jersey], rather.
Speaker 2: Well, he left New Jersey when his mother [Estella West Hayman] was a servant in the Haddon household.  The Haddon family (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now how old was he?  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: He was sixteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: At one time he assisted his mother as a waiter in that household.  And his mother and some among the Haddons determined that Phil could do more than be a servant.  And that in order for that to happen, Phil would need an education 'cause he was highly intelligent and very quick with his mind.  And they saw to it that he would attend Friends Select School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  Private school in Philadelphia, still exists today and it's still very private.
Speaker 1: That's a Quaker school.
Speaker 2: Yes sir.  And he was encouraged, as he told me and I later checked out and learned that he was recognized by the then-headmaster of Friends Select School, whose name I don't think I ever knew.  And--
Speaker 1: He was recognized how?
Speaker 2: By his ability and desire to learn and know.
Speaker 1: Did he receive some kind of recognition or something in terms of--
Speaker 2: Not that I'm aware of, not there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But my [paternal] great-grandmother [Agnes Roberts], when he had gone probably as far as he could go or was allowed to go at Friends Select, my great-grandmother insisted that he become a cadet at Bordentown Manual Arts and Military Training School [Bordentown School; Manual Training and Industrial School for Colored Youth, Bordentown, New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then a very prestigious--
Speaker 1: Prep school, was that what it was?
Speaker 2: Yeah, manual arts and military training, and my dad became a steam engineer and received his certificate.
Story_ID: 304494
Speaker 1: --You were just mentioning off camera--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that your [paternal] grandfather [William Hayman] grew tomatoes for Campbell Soup Company.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Describe those tomatoes.
Speaker 2: Well my grandfather was a truck farmer, and New Jersey being the Garden State, so called, then and even now.  He, his principal crop was tomatoes.  Large, juicy beefsteak tomatoes.  And the variety is still known today as beefsteak tomatoes.  His principal crop moved to Campbell Soup from Chesilhurst, New Jersey up to Camden, New Jersey.  And of his five trucks that operated daily, loaded with beefsteak tomatoes.  They knew Mr. [William] Hayman [ph.] was coming, his name, and that there would be a dock for his trucks available the minute they arrived.  So while his peaches and other crops went to the canning house or the jam factory, his tomatoes went to Campbell Soup.  Campbell Soup made their reputation on tomato soup.
Story_ID: 304495
Speaker 1: You said your father [Phillip James Donovan] had a certificate in steam engineering.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now is, now did he become an engineer?
Speaker 2: No sir.
Speaker 1: Okay, what did he end up doing?
Speaker 2: He ended up working WPA, Works Progress Association [sic. Works Progress Administration] or--
Speaker 1: Administration.
Speaker 2: --Administration, authority, whatever.  When we were very young, we, his children were very young, he did WPA and we never had welfare, didn't need it.  After the WPA, he hauled coal.  He drove a tractor trailer for a local coal company.  And did that until coming down a mountain one day the truck jackknifed.  And he said, "That's enough of that" (laughter).  So he continued to pursue opportunities to exercise his certificate and do the work he was good at doing.  His whole time at Bordentown [School; Manual Training and Industrial School for Colored Youth, Bordentown, New Jersey], he was the chief steam engineer, as a cadet and as a student.  Well, shortly after the WPA and the coal hauling, the Second World War [World War II, WWII] came along.  And my father went to volunteer as a graduate of Bordentown Military Training and Manual Arts [sic.].  But because he was a single surviving son, he had no brothers or sisters, and he had four little children, he was not accepted into military service, into the then it would have been the [U.S.] Army.  So instead he went to work at Scott Paper Company in Chester [Pennsylvania].  And he presented himself and his credentials and was not hired as a steam engineer or any engineer of any sort.  He was hired as a laborer to load boxcars with thirsty fiber towels (laughter) in the war effort.  And he and others like him of color with outstanding credentials, worked as mules loading boxcars.  But my father had access to some other people at Scott Paper Company who could recognize that they had real talent that they were not using.  So some people went out and they hired some women who were left behind by their husbands who were at war overseas.  And my dad helped train some of them to do the steam engineering that he was now permitted to do.  And we still had then and still have now, very firm belief in educating and what we're doing now is trying to look back and remember and recall because I believe, and my children [Joelen Donovan-Gray and Vernon Hemsley] now believe, that if you don't have a sense of your history, you might not get where you're going or think you're going.
Story_ID: 304496
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents [Willie Virginia Jones and Phillip James Donovan] met?
Speaker 2: Oh yes (laughter).  I told you my mother left Yale, Virginia and went to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] where she was taken in and, and hired indeed, by the doctor's family.  And she did not continue her formal education.  In Yale, Virginia she went to about fifth grade, but she insisted that her children, me for one, did the homework after the study done, did the chores.
Speaker 1: Now I was asking how your parents met now.
Speaker 2: How they met.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I don't wanna get you in it yet.  This is pre-you.
Speaker 2: Okay, my dad was in the Haddon household, my mom was in the doctor's home.  And when they had time off during the summer, they used to go to the beach.  I was about to say Johnson's Beach [ph.], but it wasn't.  It was a little beach in New Jersey, close to, within easy proximity for both, and they met there on what was even at that time, the black beach.  And they were--people knew some other people that you know each other and they met and they dated and they liked each other and they eventually married.
Story_ID: 304497
Speaker 1: Now can you describe your mother's [Willie Virginia Jones] personality and your father's [Phillip James Donovan] personality and, tell us, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: It's hard for me to say because I was offered from each of them the best that was in them.  And I appreciate it.  My father could bake loaves of bread and make the rolls, and I can bake some rolls.  My mama made the biscuits (laughter).  And when she would dare to play, try to make the rolls, man them boys would be so hard, we'd be squiggling around like pucks (laughter).  But she could make the biscuits and my daddy never could.  He could, man he couldn't make the biscuits.  If she made biscuits, he would make the gravy.  My dad was keenly aware of, given a certain attitude and support, one could learn higher things than baking loaves of breads and making biscuits.  So my mama kept the house and looked after the kids, and my daddy went out to get the wherewithal to make all of that possible.  So some child growing up, and I told you part of his family tree is agrarian.  Man, I learned very early in my life that if you're gone raise tomatoes, you have to get the weeds out 'cause the weeds will produce no fruit, but they will take the nutrient from the soil.  So I learned how to pull weeds (laughter), pull of my shoes after a rainstorm and walk barefoot pulling the weeds down from the roots.  And at the same time, at the same time, I went to Sunday school and I read the Bible and I learned some stuff, and so my learning appetite if you will, was triggered by my father's example.  By then I knew about Friends Select [School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and I knew about Bordentown [School; Manual Training and Industrial School for Colored Youth, Bordentown, New Jersey], and I knew that at that time some things were not going to be forthcoming.
Story_ID: 304498
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?  The first childhood memory, an earliest one.
Speaker 2: Lord, yes.  I remember crawling around on the floor in Chesilhurst, New Jersey while my mom [Willie Virginia Jones] was preparing dinner on the big old cook stove.  And she also had a tub of water heating to do laundry.  And little Joe [HistoryMaker Joseph Donovan], always curious, went to pull up on that hot stove, and his mom smacked him clear across the room.  And so even today I tell my children if I see you crossing a railroad track and a train is coming, I will break your leg before I let you get out there in that path of danger.  Earliest childhood memory.  And I still have a little mark on my body from having been burned on a hot stove.  Not that cook stove, but another hot stove in the house.
Speaker 1: Well did you finally learn to stay away from (laughter)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) When you don't know what fire is, you might stick your hand in there, but you won't do it again.  Or, you likely will not do it again.
Speaker 1: Well you had two chances now, so.  You've probably learned, you know.
Speaker 2: Three strikes you're out.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: I don't like striking out.
Story_ID: 304499
Speaker 1: Now can you describe the neighborhood you grew up in?  Did you grow up in the same neighborhood continuously, or did you move around a lot?
Speaker 2: Well, we were in Chesilhurst, New Jersey from the time of my birth in Camden [New Jersey] until age eight.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When we then moved to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] because my father [Phillip James Donovan] was at Scott Paper Company in Chester [Pennsylvania] and missed his family.  He couldn't always come back because gas was rationed and travel was limited and in the war [World War II, WWII] effort frequently he was working double shifts.
Speaker 1: So did--what, what part of town, Philadelphia, did you live in?
Speaker 2: West Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: West Philadelphia, okay.  Now let me ask you.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now to describe the neighborhood for us that you grew up--I mean beginning in New Jersey.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I guess and tell us about some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?  What did you see, what did you smell, what did you hear, okay.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  In Chesilhurst where our nuclear family was, was my [paternal] great-grandmother [Agnes Roberts], my [paternal] grandmother [Estella West Hayman], my Aunt Rose [ph.], my Uncle Mile [ph.], my Aunt Helen [ph.], my Uncle Dan [ph.], and we didn't have any cousins there 'cause none of them had offspring.  We were the only children in the family.
Speaker 1: Could you spell Chesilhurst for us?
Speaker 2: Yes, C-H-E-S-I-L-H-U-R-S-T.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: After Lord Chesilhurst [ph.] (laughter).
Speaker 1: A popular person of New Jersey history, I guess.
Speaker 2: Whatever, maybe somewhat William Penn (laughter).  Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what were some of the sights and sounds and smells?
Speaker 2: Oh man, the sights were the farms bearing fruits and vegetables we as a community in Chesilhurst, we were largely agrarian, or agricultural workers.  That meant that, you know, we go picking and the farmers, my [paternal] grandfather [William Hayman] being one of them, the farmers knew each other.  And sometime if they had a heavy crop, they'd say to my grandfather, "I need you boy over here," and so on.  Well that's the way farmers do, even until today they, they help each other.
Speaker 1: So you were, you grew up in rural New Jersey.
Speaker 2: Yes, that was rural.  Yes we were, yeah we were farmers, but we were gardeners in the Garden State, if you will.
Speaker 1: Yeah, a lot of people when they think of New Jersey, they think of like an urban kind of setting, not unlike the drive that Tony Soprano makes from New York, his home, you know every week on 'The Sopranos.'
Speaker 2: Well today, today sometimes we call places like Chesilhurst a suburb.  But because of its principal population being of color, it is not regarded a suburb as is Haddonfield [New Jersey].  It tried to become a bedroom community with a growing metroplex.
Story_ID: 304500
Speaker 1: So most of your neighbors are black, other black farmers that lived around?
Speaker 2: Well no, we were about fifty, fifty.  We were black and Italian and, and, and, and German, Hoffman [ph.].  One of my finest childhood friends was Bernie Hoffman [ph.].  I wasn't really welcomed in his house, but he was welcomed at mine.  So he would get on his bike and ride up there (laughter).  And, and that was great, that was great.  Sights and sounds and smells.  Back then in Chesilhurst [New Jersey] you had a garden.  But you also had some chickens, and you had some pigs, and, and you had an outhouse.  Talk about smells.  My lord, okay.  On the brighter side of the smell, in the spring of the year when trees would blossom, you could smell the aroma in the air.  And you knew that later was going to produce the apple tree apples, cherry tree cherries, peach tree peaches.  And you could smell the soil when the freeze was thawing and the fields were being plowed, soil's being turned over.  Man, what an aroma.  When you had worked hard and you could go to Atlantic City [New Jersey] in Pop Pop's [Donovan's paternal grandfather, William Hayman] car.  Man, you could smell the [Atlantic] Ocean, still can (laughter).  So yeah, Pop Pop was a farmer and he worked hard.  He was up every morning before the sun came up.  And he'd take little Joe [HistoryMaker Joseph Donovan] out with him 'cause Joe would, he worked.  Joe loved to work, still do.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were a good worker.
Speaker 2: I didn't become an engineer.  I did become an optician in high school [Edward Bok Vocational School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Now I don't wanna get you that far yet.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Let's, let's go to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] now.
Speaker 2: Philadelphia moving to West Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: And how did you adjust to that?
Speaker 2: Okay because, you know, home was always home and wherever, you know.
Story_ID: 304501
Speaker 1: Did I ask you how many brothers and sisters you have already?
Speaker 2: I have three sisters and no brothers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have adopted brothers within organizations and places I've been.
Speaker 1: Now where do you fall in the family?  The three sisters, are they--
Speaker 2: Okay, I am the third of four.
Speaker 1: Okay so you're the only son.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My two senior sisters are, and I, are separated by two years between our birth.  Our youngest sister is three years younger than we.
Speaker 1: Now did your sisters kind of take care of you?  Being the only boy in the middle of all those sisters.
Speaker 2: No, those three sisters as women sometime will, would gang up on that little male thing.  Man them girls kept my nose to the stone.  Every which way I turned.  But if I led the way in learning to ride a bike, one of 'em wanted me to teach her, and I did.  One of 'em wanted to be my roadie as I called it, sitting on my crossbars with the little one.  And then the middle one would get jealous 'cause Anne [Donovan] was the oldest and Joy [ph.] was the youngest, and I was the only boy.  And she was left out (laughter).  So I'd offered to take her for a ride on my bike since she didn't wanna learn how to ride it.  But she'd have to go get all gussied up and put on her crinoline, her poodle shirt and be admired by those who were looking because she was privileged, wasn't everybody who could take my time on my bike.  So yeah the pecking order was that man, at times them chicks would gang up on me (laughter).  But we survived.
Story_ID: 304502
Speaker 1: So how would you describe your personality growing up?  What kind of a young man were you growing up, as a little kid and what would people say about you?  What do you think they would--how would they describe--
Speaker 2: Well I was extremely sociable and I always, always until today, can get enough for me and have some to share, and I love to do that.  That's part of how the [National] Association of Black Journalists [NABJ] was born.  Some of us had some stuff that we could share.  Some of us needed security of numbers and needed some clout.  West Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] was the first time that I was in close proximity to some Jewish people, some Irish people who were different from my New Jersey community.
Speaker 1: So your neighborhood in West Philadelphia was, was that integrated (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yes sir, it was.  It was thoroughly integrated.  And one block from where we lived it was almost all Irish.  One block down from where we were it was almost all colored.  The block that we lived in was black, Irish, Jewish, some blacks from the higher echelon, if you will.  Not many from the lower echelon in our block.  But we all knew each other, and we liked each other.  We just kind of got along.  My Jewish neighbor, one of my best childhood friends, was a Jewish kid.  And I learned bagels and lox from his house where we would frequently eat.  He learned black eyed peas and hog maws from my house where he would often eat.  So we were--
Speaker 1: He's not supposed to, you know, not the hog maws.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) They, they were not what do you call--
Speaker 1: Kosher.
Speaker 2: They were not Orthodox.  They were not Orthodox.  But yes they ate kosher foods and bought kosher when they could.  Sure, I'm trying to think of the cracker, unleavened is a--it'll come.
Speaker 1: I know I know what it is, too, and I can't think of it.
Speaker 2: Matzo.
Speaker 1: Matzo, yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh man, I got to love matzo balls (laughter).
Story_ID: 304503
Speaker 1: So yeah we had a very integrated and a very tight community [in West Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  Such that when one guy came in and was going to open a bar a block from where we lived, the men in the neighborhood said, "Not here."  And they went in there on its opening night and they ordered their shots and beer--a round.  And he served them reluctantly.  And when they finished, he'd pick up the glass and break it.  And they say, "Bring me another one" (laughter).  Tore him up.  And because of the protests and others who agreed that it was not a good idea for us to have a bar there, which would not only be a detriment as we saw it to the neighborhood, but would also be a, a monument to bigotry.  We said, "No."  So he closed and he went his way and instead we got a little grocery store there, which later put in a soda fountain, which later I worked in.
Speaker 2: What was the name of it?
Speaker 1: Well let's see, the first people who had it were the Growlniks [ph.], and they were followed by the Polands [ph.].  One of their daughters, Dotsie [ph.] went to Hollywood and became an actress and whatever.  And the Polands were followed by--
Speaker 2: So what did they call the store, though?  What--did it have a name?
Speaker 1: They called it Store (laughter).  And yeah, it, as I recall, had a little plaque under the Pepsi[-Cola; PepsiCo] sign which was a big store sign.  The name of the proprietor was first Growlnik and then Poland.
Speaker 2: So it just changed with the name of the proprietor.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 304504
Speaker 1: Was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, you betcha.
Speaker 1: So what church did you all go to?
Speaker 2: Oh Lord, in Chesilhurst [New Jersey] we went to Grants A.M.E. Church [sic. Grant A.M.E. Church] where my [paternal] grandfather [William Hayman (ph.)] was choir master and superintendent of Sunday schools.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what about in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: In Philadelphia we went to a church from my mother's [Willie Virginia Jones] background.  My mother's background was Baptist.  And so when we went to Philadelphia, we went to Mount Olivet Tabernacle Baptist Church [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Okay, Mount Olivet Tabernacle.
Speaker 2: Yes, Baptist Church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Pastored by the Reverend Marshall [L.] Shepherd [Sr.] whose name you might--
Speaker 1: Well the name, it sounds like a good name for a pastor, Marshall Shepherd.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) The shepherd.  He was, he was a shepherd.  He was a prominent minister with a significant congregation.
Story_ID: 304505
Speaker 1: Did you have a significant role in church [Mount Olivet Tabernacle Baptist Church, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] as a youth?
Speaker 2: You betcha.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: On Sunday, Sunday was church day, even though they had prayer meeting night and choir rehearsal night and this and that.  For me, Sunday was church day.  Start with Sunday school, then went to morning service, and then it went to getting out from a service that started at eleven [o'clock] sometimes at two o'clock in the afternoon if the preacher got all fired up, you know.  And then we'd go from church and take off our Sunday clothes and put on our more casual clothes and go to Woodside [Amusement] Park [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and ride the rollercoaster (laughter) and go in the fun house.
Speaker 1: So this is a major amusement park was nearby?
Speaker 2: It was at that time, yes.  Yes, it was--I mean it no longer exists today, but yes it was major (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, so, Woodside Park.
Speaker 2: Woodside Park.
Speaker 1: Right there in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Yeah, right outside of Fairmount Park [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] which was public land and this was privately owned.  And it had Crystal Pool, but us colored people couldn't go to Crystal Pool.  Couldn't get in the pool (laughter), out of the question.
Speaker 1: Now was Crystal Pool that real huge pool [sic. Concourse Lake, Centennial Exposition grounds, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Well it was then, okay.  It would be like a backyard pool today by today's standards because today we have within the megalopolis of theme parks something called water adventure or whatever, water slides and--
Speaker 1: Okay.  No, I just thought it might have been that huge one, but I guess it's not.  But there was one back in the day that was, that was really huge even by today's standards in the Philadelphia area.  I've seen a photo of it with people standing around it.
Speaker 2: No, well that would not have been it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Although it did occupy about a, about a half a block.  I don't know how that would reduce to, you know, acreage measure, whatever.  But yeah it was very large.
Story_ID: 304506
Speaker 1: What did you like to do when you were coming along?  What were your favorite pastimes and things to do?  Did you like TV or radio?  Well TV came along a little later, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But radio and TV and movies and--
Speaker 2: Well I liked, I liked radio.  I like radio so much that I even learned how to repair a radio.  'Cause in the old days our radio, our family radio at that time was GE [General Electric] or Emerson [Radio Corporation], I'm not sure which.  But a resistor would come loose or a capacitor would come loose and my dad [Phillip James Donovan] used to--bang (laughter)--and it would re-establish the contact.  Well Joe [HistoryMaker Joseph Donovan], curious, I've always been curious, okay.  I wanted to know.  I turned that bad boy--I took him out of its case, turned him upside down, saw what was hanging, saw where it belonged.  Got a soldering iron and put it back and no more--bonk (laughter).
Speaker 1: No more smacking.
Speaker 2: That's right.  No more pounding on, okay.  Sometimes even today some things respond better to a pound than they do to observation, understanding (laughter).  What did I like to do?  I have always liked to help, and I still do today.  I'd pick up the old newspapers and the rags and take 'em to the junk shop in my homemade wagon.  And we would join--
Speaker 1: Did you make it yourself?  Did you make the wagon yourself?
Speaker 2: Yes, from an old baby carriage (laughter) and a box.  And it was hard to steer 'cause, you know, it didn't have a steering apparatus.  It had my rope, which I could pull this way and pull that way.  Same way you drive a mule (laughter).  Yee-haw (laughter).  But yeah I'd get my little money from junk shop and go on back home.  And when I had to go to the store the next morning to get the milk and the buns, my mom [Willie Virginia Jones] loved sticky buns, okay.  And she'd go to get her purse to get the money.  I'd say, "Mom, that's okay, I got it, I got it."  And so I'd get two quarts of milk, one for the family and one for me.  There came a time when I had to spit in my milk (laughter) so they wouldn't sneak my milk while I was away from the table.  So yeah, we've been blessed in so many ways for so long.  I loved to share the blessing.  Milk, yeah, y'all got one, I got one, too.
Story_ID: 304507
Speaker 1: Was music a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.  At nine years old my interest in music came from the school and through Duke Ellington and Cab Calloway.  My father [Phillip James Donovan] taking me with him to the Earle Theatre [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] to see Duke and Cab and his sister Blanche [Calloway] and others.  And one of my father's friends was Wendell Barnes [ph.], a trumpeter who had his own little band.  And we'd talk a little bit about music and I always liked drums, man.  Find me patting, drumming and so on.  I was asked by my father if I wanted to make music and I said, "Yeah."  I asked for drums and they said no drums for Joe [HistoryMaker Joseph Donovan].  "You're not gon' have any drums, you pick something else."  But I had been impressed by I can't remember exactly the name, but there was a saxophone player, had this great big saxophone with the loop up top.  I later learned it was a baritone sax, said, "That's what I want."  They said, "You're too little, you can't handle that."  And, oh, we'd keep talking and I'd keep harping and messing with people and one day my dad came home with a trumpet.  Oh man, little old trumpet, it only has three little keys on it.  No man.  But his friend Wendell who was accomplished and making money after he left Scott Paper [Company, Chester, Pennsylvania], then they'd go play some gigs, you know and get paid some duckies [ph.] and all the chicks would gather round during the break, you know.  Chicks were drawn to the boys in the band like a magnet, okay.  So anyway, yes, I got some trumpet lessons originally from Wendell Barnes, my dad's buddy.  And then later through my elementary school's [Belmont Elementary School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] visiting music teacher (laughter).  They had a whole circuit which they did.  Like circuit ministers.  So anyway yeah, she, she was my first formal trumpet teacher.  And she liked some of the potential which she saw because I had and have today a fairly good ear for pitch, okay.  And I have kind of natural for rhythm.  And you can see it even as we speak.  I mean I--and so I did my music thing throughout elementary and through [Mayer Sulzberger] Junior High School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and then got to high school [Edward Bok Vocational School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and was doing other things.
Speaker 1: So you didn't continue to play the trumpet?
Speaker 2: No, not in the band and not in the orchestra in high school because there were some other concerns, if you will.  Number one I had a full-time job in high school.  I worked from four to midnight.  Did my homework on the job or before I got there.  Kept my averages okay. Okay.
Speaker 1: You sound like a hard working young man.
Speaker 2: Well I've always, and still do--I enjoy hard work.  I enjoy doing something with the time you're given.  And then I believe in a good night's rest.
Story_ID: 304508
Speaker 1: Where did you start school?  Now you started in--
Speaker 2: Chesilhurst [New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Chesilhurst, and what was the name of your school?
Speaker 2: Oh, it didn't have a name.  It was Chesilhurst school (laughter).  And it went, it was a two-room school, and it went from--we then called it beginners through grade eight.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And after that you would graduate to ninth grade and what was the called the regional high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, but you, you left when you were eight years old, right?
Speaker 2: Left Chesilhurst when I was eight.
Speaker 1: Third grade?
Speaker 2: Third grade.
Speaker 1: Third grade, okay.  So what was your grade school in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Belmont Elementary School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], which when we went to enroll me there, they wanted to put me in fourth grade instead of third grade and my mom [Willie Virginia Jones] objected loudly because some people didn't think it was good to skip a grade.  But what I found was I was just repeating Chesilhurst.  We were way ahead of them, miles ahead.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did, did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: All of 'em.
Speaker 1: Favorite teachers?
Speaker 2: Yeah, two of 'em.  One a algebra teacher and homeroom teacher who I met in junior high school.
Speaker 1: What was the name of your junior high school?  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Sulzberger, S-U-L-Z-B-E-R-G-E-R.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: After a former mayor and judge in Philadelphia.  Its full name was Mayer, M-A-Y-E-R, Mayer Sulzberger [Junior High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So who was your favorite teacher there?
Speaker 2: My favorite teacher there was my homeroom teacher, who also was my algebra teacher.  Her name was then Mrs. Nellie Wolf [sic. Ms. Nellie Wolf], and she later became Mrs. Nellie Gaylord.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The name that sounds exactly like someone [Nellie Gaylord] who's here today (laughter).
Speaker 2: How about that?  And her counterpart, no I should say one of her colleagues, was James H. Hyde.  He was an English teacher.
Speaker 1: H-Y-D-E?
Speaker 2: H-Y-D-E, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he's now crossed over, he's passed on.  But he was the first one to really recognize that Joe Donovan [HistoryMaker Joseph Donovan] knows the word, he knows how to read it, he knows how to pronounce it, he knows how to spell it, he knows how to use it.
Story_ID: 304509
Speaker 1: Did you pay attention to the news when you were coming up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, sure did.
Speaker 1: I just wondered, did your family get the black papers or any other papers?
Speaker 2: Well yes, we used to get the [Philadelphia] Afro-American [Afro American Newspapers], the Pittsburgh Courier [New Pittsburgh Courier], and Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]'s own [The Philadelphia] Tribune.  And when I was ten and a half, I put my age up and I started to carry papers.  The Evening Bulletin [The Bulletin].  And when I got my wagon, my Bulletin wagon, I'd pick up my Bulletin papers and serve my route, and I would carry with me the Pittsburgh Courier, the Afro-American, The Philadelphia Tribune and The Philadelphia Independent then.  So yes, I read the headlines every day and I turned the pages every day before I even got to the sports page.
Speaker 1: So you kind of kept up with what was going on then, yeah.
Speaker 2: I was taught from a very young age that learn all you can because knowledge is power.
Speaker 1: Now did you identify with the newscasters on the radio?
Speaker 2: Certainly did, yes.
Speaker 1: And who were some of your favorites?
Speaker 2: Well I said to--well I didn't say his name before, but one of the ones was Stuart ["Stu"] Wayne, W-A-Y-N-E on KYW [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  He would not only deliver the news, but he had another show, noonday show called, 'Lunch Time with a Punch Line.'  And you would get light semi-classical music and you would get the news and you would get the weather and you would get the time.  So we knew, 'cause we had him on the radio, we knew when we had to leave to go back to school after lunch.
Speaker 1: Okay, Stuart Wayne.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I later worked with one of his sidekicks, Bill Bransome with whom I grew up listening to and Bill and I worked together at KYW, an all-news radio station in Philadelphia, premier station in the nation.  We were, we were the top.
Story_ID: 304510
Speaker 1: Now what high school did you attend?
Speaker 2: I went to Edward Bok [Vocational School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], B-O-K, vocational-technical [vo-tech] high school.
Speaker 1: Vocational-technical high school.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they wanted me at vocational-technical high school so that they could retain their accreditation as a high school and issue a diploma and not a certificate.  So we had two other vo-tech schools, [Murrell] Dobbins [Vocational School; Murrell Dobbins Career & Technical Education High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and [Jules E.] Mastbaum [Area Vocational Technical School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  But they were not accredited.  So they needed people like me who could carry a college prep load successfully in order to keep their accreditation.  At the same time, when I left Mayer Sulzberger Junior High School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], I could have been, and likely would have been, accepted at Central High School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], the top academic school.  And from there, I probably could have earned a scholarship, further education, whatever.  Instead I went to Bok and at the--by the advice of a counselor who was a part of the system to collect a paycheck and hold the prestige and whatnot.
Speaker 1: So a counselor persuaded you to go to Bok but--and when you look back, you should have gone to Central probably.
Speaker 2: Certainly should have, and probably would have.  So I went to Bok anyway.
Story_ID: 304511
Speaker 1: I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) How did you do at [Edward] Bok [Vocational School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 1: I did wonderfully well.  I--and we done okay.
Speaker 2: Were you an honor student?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And more than that, I was an optician.
Speaker 2: In high school?
Speaker 1: Yes sir, a dispensing optician.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's the bottom line of a long story.  When I went to Bok I said, I wanna be a cabinetmaker or a tailor.  And they told me all those were full.  But did I ever think about watchmaking and, and optical mechanics and you know, "You're a colored boy.  You wear glasses," you know.  "How many colored people you know wear glasses?  You can--we can teach you to do that.  What time is it?  We can teach you to do that.  Watchmaking and jewelling, oh man, unheard of, especially among your people."
Speaker 2: So they had big plans for you.
Speaker 1: Racial steering, okay.  What they didn't tell me, was that if you open an optical shop, because the major optical laboratories won't hire you because you are of color, when you open your doors, you gotta plan to be in business for two years before you break even.  Nobody told you that stuff.  And so it all worked out well.  In fact, I used to make my own glasses--I made my mama's [Willie Virginia Jones] glasses.  I made glasses by order.  I filled the optometrist teacher's prescriptions with school district materials on school district time.  And I helped to train some of the post-graduates and veterans (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well that's, that's quite a skill to have, I mean--
Speaker 1: Oh it is, it is.
Speaker 2: But you had like--what did you, what did you want to be in high school?  What did you envision yourself being?
Speaker 1: Well when I went there, I said, I want cabinetmaking because I was good in [Mayer Sulzberger] Junior High School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] in wood shop and enjoyed it, okay.  And my mom was very proud of the stuff I made in wood shop and took home.  I mean, "Joe [HistoryMaker Joseph Donovan] made this."  And then I wanted tailoring because my mom was a seamstress and I had learned how to make little vests that I wanted to wear myself (laughter).  So yeah, cabinetmaking or tailoring, and they were full, and I got steered into optical mechanics, which turned out not to be a bad thing at all.  Just wasn't as good as it coulda or woulda been.
Story_ID: 304512
Speaker 1: You said you had a full-time job in high school [Edward Bok Vocational School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You stopped playing the trumpet because you had a full-time job (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: What did you do full-time?
Speaker 2: Well, I started out (laughter) working from four to eleven [o'clock] as a dishwasher in Liggett's store in the Suburban Station [Penn Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And I stayed with them for a little over a year.  And when I left them, I was short order cook on the counter.  And somebody else was washing the dishes.  But I was that person's supervisor, 'cause when I was washing the dishes, there was no such thing as a cup on the counter with lipstick on the rim.  There was no such thing as a fork with residue between the tines.  So on my shift I had someone reporting to me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you did this--
Speaker 2: I did that for just over a year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I went to Albert Einstein Medical Center [Einstein Medical Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and signed on in the dish room and washed dishes there.  It was a lot bigger job than the one I had at Liggett's.  More volume, more everything.
Speaker 1: So did all that--you know working full-time, did that affect your ability to participate in high school activities?  I guess it would have to.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah it did.
Speaker 1: Couldn't--were you involved in any clubs or any of those kinds of things in high school?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I did, however, I used to buy my season book to the football games and the basketball games.  And when I could get some time, I would go to the important games, okay.  And in the interim, I would take my, my ticket from my passbook and give it to somebody who didn't have one.
Speaker 1: So that probably increased your popularity a little bit?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it did.  I'd always been a little, you know, choosy about my people, okay.  I love 'em all, I just don't like 'em all, okay.  So I very much believe in, and ascribe highly to birds of a feather flocking together (laughter).  Ask a crow his opinion of a starling (laughter).  Yeah, yes I maintained my interest in sports, but I also maintained my interest in the overall.  You see I was committed to the season pass because in high school the athletic association was responsible to raise its own money for the extras.  And they still are today.  Little League, the same way, you know.  So yes I've always wanted to do what I consider to be my part.
Story_ID: 304513
Speaker 1: Your senior year--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did you have any prospects for going to college your senior year?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, yes sir I did.
Speaker 1: And what was your advice about that and what did you end up doing (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well I had my mother [Willie Virginia Jones] and my eldest sister [Anne Donovan] pledging to whatever means necessary.  They were gonna see to it that I got to college.
Speaker 1: Okay, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I refused.  I did not apply, was not offered any scholarship anywhere, okay.  And I was again counseled by some folks who you know, profiteered from the public school system, I was again, you know, counseled and steered in some other direction.  So after graduation, I checked out some things and decided I didn't want to try to enlist in the [U.S.] Air Force at that time because we're talking about, I believe it was Korea.
Speaker 1: So, so this is when you graduated is what year?  Nineteen--
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-four [1954].
Speaker 1: Fifty-four [1954], right.
Speaker 2: June 1954.
Speaker 1: All right, and you said, the Korean War was still going on, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was either--
Speaker 1: Taking off?
Speaker 2: --still going on or it was coming up to a full involvement.  No, no, no.  It had cooled off somewhat, and I was having contact with some people who had fought in Korea and came back with their lives. And--
Speaker 1: There was still a U.S. occupation force in Korea (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: There still is now today, Germany.
Speaker 2: Yeah. It was, it was something else.  So I decided I didn't want to enlist right then.  That I'd work for a while.  And I had, you know, some very good jobs 'cause I had a good work record and people spoke and thought highly of me and people had been willing to help along the way.
Speaker 1: Now did your optometry skills in high school, did they translate to a, to a job anywhere afterwards?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) School of hard knocks.  The optical companies used to come over to [Edward] Bok [Vocational School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] to recruit students who were veterans, post-graduate students and regular school students.  And having been blessed with my name, Joseph James Donovan [HistoryMaker Joseph Donovan], two saints and an Irish behind, on occasion when the recruiters would show up, they'd send for me.  Man, I was the top of the pile in that shop.  And I'd go down there, there would be someone who would ask me, "May I help you?"  And I'd say, "I'm Joseph Donovan, you sent for me."  "Oh we sent for you?  Well that was a mistake."
Story_ID: 304514
Speaker 1: Were you able to use your skills in optometry for a living--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you said that--
Speaker 2: I never got to optometry, I am an optician, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay. So you make the glasses, you can make the--
Speaker 2: I studied--yeah, fill the prescription like the pharmacist and I came, I learned that skill under an optometrist who used to--after he left the school district job, go back to his home and office and practice his optometric craft.  He was a doctor and he'd do his refractions in his own private practice.  And he would bring the prescriptions to [Edward Bok Vocational] School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and hand them over to me to fill with school district materials (laughter) while he was collecting a school district paycheck, while he also had me assisting him as a teacher for post-graduate veterans under the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944] and regular school students who were there like me.  And was happy to do it.  And he also had me dispensing, his sitting people down, sitting patients down who came to us from the Department of Welfare, Catholic charities, and some school program, which I don't recall the exact name of right now.  But yes, we would have adults and children come in there to be--with a prescription to be filled.  And I likely would get some of those prescriptions and grind and polish the lens and mount the lens, and they would have a ready date, and they'd show up on the ready date, and I'd sit them down and I'd take their papillary distance to properly center and so on.  And yes, I was a dispensing optician from halfway through eleventh grade through my senior year.  I never got a job doing that and race, indeed, was a factor.  No ifs, ands or buts about it.
Speaker 1: Okay, what--
Speaker 2: So after I worked for a year and I reconsidered the [U.S.] military, we had then selective service and you had your draft card.  I was 1-A and I didn't wanna get (laughter) drafted into the [U.S.] Army.  I didn't wanna be a poundy grounder [ground pounder] we called them, okay.  So I looked into the [U.S.] Air Force and I was told by the recruiter how thrilled he was that I was an optician and, "We need opticians in the worst way. And if you come in here," (laughter), "you probably won't even have to go through all the basic training.  We'll put you right to work."  He lied (laughter).  They had no optical activity in the United Sates Air Force (laughter).  That was the Signal Corps of the Army and the [U.S.] Department of the Navy.
Story_ID: 304515
Speaker 1: So what did you do in the [U.S.] Air Force (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh man (laughter), some of this, some of that.
Speaker 1: Where were you stationed?  Where did they put you?
Speaker 2: Well my basic training was at Sampson Air Force Base in Geneva, [Seneca County] New York.
Speaker 1: So is this in '56 [1956]?
Speaker 2: Fifty-five [1955], October of '55 [1955].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I enlisted in the United States Air Force.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And did my basic training there and left there shipping to Ardmore, Oklahoma.  And was there for a year and then was on orders (laughter) for shipment to Burtonwood, England; Keflavik, Iceland, neither of which came off because they were red, I was redlined because of a concern about race.
Speaker 1: Okay now what happened?  What's the story?  What did you--what kind of trouble did you make in that situation (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Well actually, no it was not of my making.  But I was, I was cut orders, again, because of my name.  And they did not have a racial profile.  But when they found out who indeed I was, I was redlined off the orders.  First to Burtonwood, England because they were having some upheaval there among disparate people.
Speaker 1: In the Air Force itself?
Speaker 2: In the Air Force, yes, yes, yes.  That was shortly after [President Harry S.] Truman ordered the integration of all of the [U.S.] Armed Forces.
Speaker 1: So even by the, even by the--
Speaker 2: By 1956--
Speaker 1: Mid to late '50s [1950s], it still was a struggle to fully integrate (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You betcha, you betcha.  Segregation, discrimination for those who would hold still for it.  Some of us just wouldn't do it.
Speaker 1: So, I think a lot of people when they read historical timeline and they say, they see that--say slavery was, you know, I mean the Emancipation Proclamation was signed on this date or Truman integrated the [U.S.] Army on this date in 1948.  They think it happened on that date.
Speaker 2: It happened.
Speaker 1: But it doesn't have an--
Speaker 2: No sir it does not.  And has not.  Civil Rights Act [of 1964], yes.  Act how, when (laughter)?
Speaker 1: So it's still a struggle beyond--it goes beyond the signing of the document or a passing of a law.
Speaker 2: Certainly.  Now is the time.  Now is the time to stop the nonsense.
Story_ID: 304516
Speaker 1: So what did they [U.S. Air Force] do?  They, they couldn't send you to--they found out you weren't the one they wanted to send to England.
Speaker 2: That's right, so they sent me to Stephenville, Newfoundland [and Labrador, Canada] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Thriving metropolis.
Speaker 2: Which, when I reported in on my orders [at Ernest Harmon Air Force Base, Stephenville, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada] (laughter), the first sergeant read me the riot act.  Told me he wasn't gonna have any upheaval, and so he was gonna put me in a room with three big white guys.  So (laughter), okay.
Speaker 1: So were they, were they, were they threatened by black people that actually tried to make them live up to the integration of the [U.S.] Army or what?
Speaker 2: They were threatened a couple of ways.  For example in, in Newfoundland [and Labrador, Canada] the black airmen didn't call white females "goofy Newfies."
Speaker 1: What now?
Speaker 2: Goofy Newfies.
Speaker 1: They didn't call them that?
Speaker 2: Did not call them that.  We called them by name.
Speaker 1: Now they were called goofy Newfies by the white airmen?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now why would--explain that to us.  We don't--see, people don't really know what that's about.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, there are those who believe that because of a calcium deficiency, okay, a lot of Newfoundlanders lost their teeth.  More prevalent among the females 'cause they bore the babies.  And some of 'em didn't make too nice an appearance.  And some people derisively referred to them as goofy Newfies--goofy Newfoundlanders--goofy Newfies.  But some other people who knew a little bit about what poverty is and what deficiency is and whatnot, referred to those people with some understanding and respect as other decent human beings.  And so it became a good many of the limited number of women, females there found themselves drawn towards people who understood, respected them and cared for them.  Who also, by the way, had access to the PX, post exchange (laughter) and the commissary.
Story_ID: 304517
Speaker 1: And these are the jobs a lot of the black people, soldiers had, I mean airmen [with the U.S. Air Force] had with the PX [post exchange] and the commissary and so forth?
Speaker 2: No, no.  Those are private operations [of the Army and Air Force Exchange Service] across the [U.S.] Armed Forces, okay.  They're commercial entities, as is the airmen's club and the NCO [non-commissioned officer] club and the officers' club, those are all private enterprise.  Yes?  Yes.  So some of our fellow airmen who were not people of color didn't like it very much because some of the people of color were attracting more female attention than they were able to.  And so when I got there in October of 1956, there were people lined up, one group on one side of the main street in town [Stephenville, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada], the other group on the other side of main street in the town off the base [Ernest Harmon Air Force Base, Stephenville, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada], okay.  Ready to have at each other.  So--which is why when I arrived in October of '56 [1956], first sergeant said, "I'm not gone have any stuff outta you, or I'm going to put you in a room with three big white guys."  And it worked out okay.  Fine, I, you know, everything worked out okay.  I went into supply, and I'd done that in Oklahoma.  And I'd gotten my rank as airman second class [airman first class (A1C)] when I reported in overseas.  And ran the supply room and learned a lot and this and that and earned my airman first class three stripes as soon as I was eligible and before I left there in October of '58 [1958], I had been (laughter) commissioned as a staff sergeant, noncommissioned officer with minimum time and grade.
Story_ID: 304518
Speaker 1: Well what happened after the [U.S.] Air Force?
Speaker 2: Oh man (laughter).  Well, I had earned my G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944] with the education benefits and whatnot, okay (laughter).  And while I was in the Air Force I had taken some college courses under the U.S. Air Force Extension [Course] Institute, USAFE [sic. ECI].  And when I went to take my G.I. Bill and my credits to enroll at Temple University [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], I was told that my high school [Edward Bok Vocational School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] diploma carried no weight, and my credits from my USAFE course administered by a major university, okay, carried no weight.  And I would have to enroll in Temple [University] High School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] in order to be considered for admission into Temple University.
Speaker 1: So they didn't recognize a degree from a public high school in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right.  That's exactly correct.  Fully accredited, indeed.  And I helped make that possible.
Speaker 1: So what did you do?  What did you have to do?
Speaker 2: Well I, (coughing), please excuse me.  I took a job driving a yellow cab.  I enrolled in a course called photogrammetry and cartography, which is interpretation of aerial photographs and map making.
Speaker 1: Now where did you enroll in this course?
Speaker 2: At Bok.  Back to Bok as a post-grad and now an Air Force veteran (laughter).  And I also undertook the study of the sale of real estate.  So I was a training real estate salesman heading toward becoming either a broker or enrolling in Penn State College of Optometry [Pennsylvania State College of Optometry, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Salus University, Elkins Park, Pennsylvania] to become an optometrist because I already was an optician hitting dead ends here, there, okay.  And driving the taxicab (laughter) from five to two A.M. getting about two, three hours' sleep, you know, a night.  But when you're twenty-three, you can do that, you know (laughter).  You can stand on your head, you can bounce, bounce high.
Speaker 1: Well some can (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) If you're determined and deliberate, you can do it.  Most people can do it.  Right now, you know, I'm sure there are times when you take a power nap, twenty minutes, forty winks.
Story_ID: 304519
Speaker 1: You're driving a taxi.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You're going to [Edward Bok Vocational] School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And, and selling real estate.
Speaker 1: Selling real estate, yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: And I decided I wanted to get out of that because I found myself in a position where I was being encouraged to engage in what was then in 1959 blockbusting, which you might have heard about.
Speaker 1: Yes.  Can you just describe what that is so that people never heard of it know what it is (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  My broker under whom I was training, okay, suggested to me that I go into a certain neighborhood, knock on some doors and tell them we were looking for people to represent in the sale of their homes.  And the impact was that my black face was very distinctive and word gets around.  And people begin to panic.  And the For Sale signs go up.  And so you buy low and then you sell high.
Speaker 1: Now what I've heard, in some instances, is that real estate companies would take a house, you know, buy a house from one white resident in a neighborhood, maybe, and put a whole lot of black people in that house.  I mean a mother with maybe fifteen kids or something.
Speaker 2: Fifteen, yeah.
Speaker 1: And let 'em just run around.  And then have you knock on every door and say, "Aren't you ready to sell your house?"
Speaker 2: Yeah, well some of that was true.
Speaker 1: Was that--how did your company operate?  I mean how did they do it?
Speaker 2: "Why don't you go over here and get us some listings," okay?  "Knock on some doors, cold call."  And then word gets around that there's this colored guy, if you will, "We know how that works.  We know how they are."  So you know people get panicky.  You're talking about the real value of their home, their largest investment.  And so some of 'em will give you a listing and some of 'em will go to somebody else and give them a listing and the neighborhoods were largely up for sale.  And you buy 'em low and sell 'em high, often to unqualified buyers of color, so that you could repossess it or foreclose it in a year or two.
Speaker 1: And then sell it to somebody--
Speaker 2: And sell it to somebody else.  And so the neighborhoods, some of the neighborhoods which once were prestige neighborhoods, declined and got to be known as slums with slumlords who rented to a single mother who had no income and fifteen kids.  They owned it, but they wouldn't live in it; they'd rent it and they would be--they became slumlords.  And [HistoryMaker] Charlayne Hunter-Gault wrote a book about that called 'South Streets' [sic.] some years ago. It's a wonderful book.  Great piece of work.
Story_ID: 304520
Speaker 1: You refused to participate in this [blockbusting], or didn't--
Speaker 2: That's exactly correct.  I said, "This is not the business for me."  And I learned that some of the four--a group of people called the 400 Ministers of Philadelphia.  Ministers of color were putting pressure on the Evening Bulletin [The Bulletin] and The Philadelphia Inquirer and the Philadelphia Daily News and said, "Yeah, we got some coloreds, they run the elevators, sweep the floors," and this and that.  Said, "Hey," they said, "It's time for something more or other."  And pressure was on, so I got hired by the Philadelphia Daily News.
Speaker 1: Now had you--did you have a history--had you written for anyone else (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, but I had gone to The Philadelphia Independent, a black newspaper which is now defunct.  But I went there for a job, and they published once a week.  And I was told because of my lack of experience and this and that, that there was nothing there for me.  And I even offered to sell ad space for them, but they were fairly elitist.  And it kind of broke my heart.  I mean they, you know I lost my--temporarily lost my drive and momentum.
Speaker 1: But you were hired by the Philadelphia Daily News--
Speaker 2: Yes sir.
Speaker 1: Now that's one of the, that's one of the big dailies in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: You betcha.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you were hired and you were never--you really didn't have any experience in journalism (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no.
Speaker 1: You had experience in real estate at that point, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And well what, what--how did you persuade them to hire you?  Or how did they--what was the rationale?
Speaker 2: Well before I--when I was first discharged from the [U.S.] Air Force in California in 1959, I applied to Aero General [sic.], maker of airplanes--Aerojet [Engineering Corporation; Aerojet Rocketdyne] for a position as a nomenclature writer, writing the design, the specifications and whatnot of the various tools and devices which they would employ in their major work.  I was considered for a similar position in Philadelphia at the--not [U.S. Army] Signal Corps, but the maker of clothing for the [U.S.] Armed Forces.  Whatever.  Anyway, that, that was a very substantial position and I knew I could do it.  Heck, I'd been doing it, okay.  Unfortunately, when I applied for that I was in California.  And when I got back to Philadelphia and to the interview stage and it became apparent that I was Joseph J. Donovan [HistoryMaker Joseph Donovan], someone of color, that door closed, too, and that was federal.  And I was mad as a wet hen (laughter).  As mad as a wet hen.  So then that's when, when I found out what the ministers were doing.  And after my real estate, cab driving, photogrammetry and cartography, okay, when I learned, because I did participate--was a member of and participant with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and the Urban League, and I have a, you know, pretty good sense of what's going on.  So I said, now it's time, you know.  So I talked to some people and was introduced to some other people and ended up being welcomed and interviewed and hired at the Philadelphia Daily News.  First in display advertising, not as a reporter, in display advertising.  We were able to do a good job there.
Speaker 1: Okay now what, what year is this?
Speaker 2: It's 1960.
Story_ID: 304521
Speaker 1: Okay, now display advertising--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Had you had any experience in display advertising?
Speaker 2: Nah.
Speaker 1: So how did you get--I still--the question is still you know, why would you--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: You see the, the dilemma here, 'cause on one hand you, you have good training that you're not able to use, 'cause people won't hire you because you're black.  Then here comes Philadelphia [Daily News]--
Speaker 2: Well they never said because I was black.  They, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, that's the implication.  And then, and then with the Philadelphia Daily News--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you're hired for things that you've never been trained to do.
Speaker 2: That's exactly correct.
Speaker 1: And what, what's the difference?  I mean what happened?
Speaker 2: Well in the interview before I was hired into ad detail, display advertising, I had spoken with a big mahoff in their art department who thought that he saw some potential in my attention to detail, and I have a memory kind of like an elephant.  I'm blessed with that, I'm thankful for it.  But he put on the pressure that I should be hired to take the proofs of the ads from the composing room back to the advertiser who were major department stores and advertising agencies and such and so on.  And go over those proofs with those folks, make whatever corrections need be made, if any.  Bring them back to the composing room at the Philadelphia Daily News, and put them into production for the next press run.  Had a good time doing that.  And was making good money (laughter).  And was offered by some of the premier advertising agencies to, "Leave there and come over here with us."  Nothing turned away, but being invited, wooed if you will.  Some of 'em were very tempting, but I chose to stay at the newspaper, so I did ad detail for eight months.  And then the Daily News needed a librarian.
Speaker 1: About what year was this?
Speaker 2: Sorry?
Speaker 1: About what year was this when they needed a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, that was still in '60 [1960], but coming up rapidly on '61 [1961].
Story_ID: 304522
Speaker 1: You were librarian for the Philadelphia Daily News, 1961.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right now you moved from being in display advertising to kind of editing and copying, looking at mistakes, to working in the library (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, exactly.
Speaker 1: How did, why did you choose that, or did they, or did it choose you?  Or how did it--
Speaker 2: The library?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: The sitting librarian was aging and the managing editor wanted a more active library.  And that's when I crossed from advertising to editorial.  I was in the library for about a year and a half, and when the Bay of Pigs Invasion came up.
Speaker 1: That was 1963 [sic. 1961], I guess.
Speaker 2: I believe it was.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: The writer writing the story both from wire copy and whatnot, correspondence, pickups from other journals, I went through a whole bunch of clips and I did a whole backgrounder leading up to the Bay of Pigs Invasion.  And the managing editor and others liked it so well that they published it intact.
Speaker 1: Now that's something.
Speaker 2: But they weren't able to give me a byline 'cause I wasn't a reporter.  But I was credited as being a contributor to our Bay of Pigs coverage.
Speaker 1: Now well what happened?  It seems like that would have to shake things up a little bit around there.
Speaker 2: Well indeed it did.  Six months later the Daily News had one colored reporter, and his name was C. Lester Fuller.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now Lester was an accomplished reporter, had been with The Philadelphia Tribune, the black newspaper, the old and famous Philadelphia Tribune.  And Fuller had some people on the editorial staff and high up in the editorial staff all shook up.  He spoke with a distinct southern drawl, and they would ride him.  He lost it and got fired because of it.  So they needed another colored reporter, and there I was (laughter) in the library, able to write, able to make contacts, which could be reliably trusted.  I became the Daily News' second reporter of color.  Now I was called the police reporter.  Police reporters chase fire engines and cop cars.  But by my own urging, I was able to speak to some folks about how our coverage of some, in some areas was sadly lacking.
Story_ID: 304523
Speaker 1: A black reporter will usually be assigned to cover black stabbings and shootings and so forth, was that it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh no, no, no, no, but it was a police reporter chasing fire engines and cop cars.
Speaker 1: But all over the city [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] or just in the black community?
Speaker 2: Well, all over the city.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Philadelphia Daily News, as I said, was a tabloid and had a pretty good circulation.  But little credibility in the black community.  So when I got on board as the police reporter, it wasn't long before I was being given general assignments that covered the elderly; that covered the minorities; all of them.  That covered some facets of education, public education.  And we were able to develop contacts who would keep us right on target.  And we were allowed to tell it like it was once the word got out that Philadelphia Daily News was earning its repu- was earning and building a new reputation as a credible journal.  So I stayed on the police beat, but I covered and handled general assignments.  I wanted to be a political reporter at city hall, but it seemed they weren't quite ready for a person of color on that elite staff.  So I stayed where I was and kept doing what I was doing.
Story_ID: 304524
Speaker 1: And in 1970 I left the [Philadelphia] Daily News and went to KYW Radio [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Now how did this come about?  I mean how did you end up, you know, going to KY--
Speaker 1: KYW?
Speaker 2: KYW radio.
Speaker 1: Yeah, a lot of that was due to the formation, founding, growth, urging harassing, haranguing broadcasters in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] that it wasn't quite enough to have one reporter of color to sit by the door.  And there were a number of people who were interested in me.  Metromedia [Inc.], Westinghouse Broadcasting [Company; Group W], three television stations each of them took a swing at me or, you know, the word gets out, you know.
Speaker 2: Why did you choose KYW?
Speaker 1: I chose KYW because they were, number one, all news, all the time.  That was our credo.
Speaker 2: Now was that the--it had to be one of the first stations to adopt that, that format, right?  All news, all the time.
Speaker 1: We were the only one at that time.
Speaker 2: I remember in the late '70s [1970s] WBBM in Chicago [Illinois] adopted all news, all the time.
Speaker 1: We had WIND in Chicago.
Speaker 2: Was that all news, all the time, too?
Speaker 1: Yes.  And--
Speaker 2: So you were a general assignment reporter with them, or did you have your own show?
Speaker 1: Well I started out as general assignment based on my reputation, my earned reputation at the newspaper.  And I later became education reporter, and then education editor (laughter).  And through that medium was how I was recommended for consideration as a Ford [Foundation] fellow in educational journalism.
Speaker 2: Now when was this?
Speaker 1: That was 1976.
Story_ID: 304525
Speaker 1: Now we're not going past the founding of NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists] are we?
Speaker 2: Well it's, NABJ, the founding of NABJ started when I was at the newspaper [Philadelphia Daily News] in the, in the last year I was at the newspaper.
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy [1970]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And we had a--
Speaker 1: This is National Association of Black Journalists.
Speaker 2: Well no it wasn't, it didn't start out that way.  We had several people of color being represented as if they were token.  They were not given the juicy assignments.  And some of them were divided.  So thirteen of us got together over at Lee Cultural Center [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  Oh no, I missed a very important part.  Yes, on a Saturday about thirteen of us got together at radio WIP's [WTEL, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] conference room.
Speaker 1: Now where is WIP?  Is that in Philadelphia [Philadelphia]?
Speaker 2: Yes, that also is in Philadelphia.  It's opposite Rittenhouse Square [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], which is a cultural site, historic cultural site.  But we had to stop meeting in any of the facilities like that because some people saw us as radical and threatening and some people bugged and, what do you call it when you slide somebody in?
Speaker 1: Saboteur.
Speaker 2: Infiltrating.
Speaker 1: Infiltrating.
Speaker 2: Yes, to feed back what we were saying doing about.
Speaker 1: Now how did you--I mean were the--all thirteen of the people involved in the news in one form or another in the City of Philadelphia?
Speaker 2: Well now and that was why we had to have a long discussion about what we were going to be known as.  So we said because we had some public relations people who weren't getting the kind of work that they could have been getting, and they were communicators because there were some public information officers and some governmental entities, like the main post office and the [U.S.] Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] and so on, that we needed to band together as a group of communicators.  And we became known and worked as the Black Communicators Associated [Inc., Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Story_ID: 304526
Speaker 1: Black Communicators Associated [Inc., Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Yes.  At one time there was some discussion as to whether or not we ought to call ourselves RATBAG, Radio and Television Black Action Group.  And we had, had to have a whole lot of discussion because we didn't wanna be seen as, or operate as elitists because there were problems in most of the news outlets, newspapers as well.  I was still with the newspaper.  So we worked closely through the community and through the ministers and civil rights leaders and other people who were not of color, but were very, very keenly interested.  See, after the riots, everybody wanted to know what in the--what are them people doing?  And we were very successful in telling our story about the community in the community and beyond.  That's why in 1970 when I left the [Philadelphia] Daily News I went straight to KYW [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] which was all news, all the time.  And I was able to as a general reporter, be able to cover the waterfront.  I mean by that big story, little stories.  And I was able to do one of the most important things, rather than spot live reporting, was able to do series reports that could run three days, five days, whatever, whatever it took.  It was one of those series, 'Why Can't Johnny Read?' [ph.].  For Pete's sake.  That was Johnny and Jane, they weren't doing so hot.  And that was not limited to the black community or the City of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  This was a phenomenon clear across the country.  Then I became Ford [Foundation] fellow after that premise.  We went (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay to discover the--I mean to further explore why--
Speaker 2: Yes, indeed.
Speaker 1: The education was failing to--
Speaker 2: Indeed, to live up to its--okay.
Speaker 1: So when did you get the Ford fellowship?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-six [1976].
Speaker 1: Okay, now in the meantime was, was, was--has NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists] been founded yet?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, NABJ went from Black Communicators Associated [1967-1968] to the Association of Black Journalists [ABJ] in 1970--1973.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And born in Philadelphia from our initial meeting and so on.  And--
Speaker 1: So was it just--did it--when did, did it become national?  It was the Association of Black Journalists, but when did it become the National Association of Black Journalists?  Was it at the same time, or--
Speaker 2: About the same time, yes [founded in 1975].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, so this is about 1973.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.  So--well you said off camera that some black people involved in journalism in those days were actually fired from their jobs.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Because they--
Speaker 2: Attended meetings, were looked at as members and conspirators, if you will.
Speaker 1: Who were the offending papers that did--that fired these people?  I mean who were they?
Speaker 2: One was the Evening Bulletin [The Bulletin], very conservative paper.
Speaker 1: In which--what city?
Speaker 2: Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: Philadelphia, Evening Bulletin.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  While no one was fired by the Daily News, I took my share of razzing and ribbing and so on.  Same thing happened at The [Philadelphia] Inquirer.
Story_ID: 304527
Speaker 1: What were the issues that prompted black people to pull themselves together around, you know, to close ranks?  Because some would argue since--well weren't you all in heaven?  You finally had jobs in the white media and once, you know, this is, you know this is your time to, you know, fulfill this dream of being out here in the, in the larger world.  I mean why would you close ranks and pull all the black journalists together?  What was going on?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Because some people were--dared to participate with this group of radical blacks.
Speaker 1: I mean why were you considered radical because you came together?  I mean why would you--
Speaker 2: Well this was if you recall, this was during that era when the civil rights marches were going on.  When Detroit [Michigan] had its riot.  When Washington, D.C. had its riot.  And--
Speaker 1: This is a little bit after that, though.  This is like '73 [1973].
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You know, right when you formed the National Association [of Black Journalists (NABJ)]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But the riots were in the '60s [1960s], late '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: Yeah, but the [Civil Rights] Movement was still alive, as you have noted, and properly so.  Because we have the Civil Rights Act [of 1964] doesn't mean that public accommodations the next day opened their doors.  So yes, it's evolution, the civil rights struggle was at its peak.  [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was in and out of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and [Ralph] Abernathy and [President James Earl] "Jimmy" Carter [Jr.] was president, getting some stuff done.
Speaker 1: This was '76 [1976], yeah, he becomes president (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, '76 [1976], yeah.
Speaker 1: In '73 [1973], I think you had the last year of [President Richard Milhous] Nixon I think, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Before he resigned and then--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Seventy-three [1973] was--
Speaker 2: And the issues even--involved in the Voting Rights Act [of 1965].
Speaker 1: Did you go, did you go to the convention in Gary [Indiana]?  The National Black Political Assembly in Gary in '72 [1972]?
Speaker 2: No, not at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay, but did that '72 [1972] convention influence you all at all?
Speaker 2: Oh absolutely it did.  It absolutely did.  'Cause some people who covered it relegated three paragraphs to it.  And there were much larger issues.  And as I say, you know, all through it, there was all of this unrest and demanding of civil and equal rights.
Story_ID: 304528
Speaker 1: Weren't the places that were integrating black people saying, your interests are the same as our interests?  If you're a black police officer, your interests should be that of the police department, right?
Speaker 2: They were saying--
Speaker 1: Or the newspaper.  I mean the Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] evening news [Evening Bulletin; The Bulletin]--
Speaker 2: [Philadelphia] Daily News.
Speaker 1: Then your interests should be that of the, of the evening news, right?  Isn't that--
Speaker 2: Yes, but you had a larger responsibility.  A journalist must keep the journal.  And to do that, you need--you must have people who will take the necessary risks to get the story.  You see, during the urban riots in Philadelphia, for example, and my firsthand coverage of that, there were those in the black community who said, "Why should I talk to you?  You work for the man."
Speaker 1: And they're assumption is your loyalty is with the paper, right?
Speaker 2: You betcha, you betcha.
Speaker 1: That overrides everything, you're with the man.
Speaker 2: "You guys are plums," okay.  "You guys have plum jobs."  But some of us did not and would not move out of the principally minority community.  And we went to the schools and urged the children to learn to read and to write and we showed our faces in places where our faces hadn't been seen before.  (Laughter) When George Wallace was campaigning to run for president, or to get the nomination to run for president, he went to a principally white section of Philadelphia called Fishtown [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and held one of his meetings there in a white church with an all-white audience.  And I walked in from the Daily News with my color intact and my hair tight and I walked right down the center aisle and sat in the first pew, the deacon's bench in that church.  And got to work with my notebook and my pen.  And Mr. Wallace's campaign speech changed from decrying black power and boosting white power, to recognizing that most colored people are just good, hard workers and had been denied and they were looking right at me to see how much of that I was getting.  I got it all and reported it all.  Later in life George Wallace, after he had been shot, came on our show, 'Black Perspective on the News.'  When he could no longer stand on his own, but with the aid of a specially designed wheelchair, if you remember.  And we were able to attract a good many people from government, politicians, educators, factory workers and unionists like 1199c [SEIU Healthcare 1199] founded [sic.] by [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.], okay.  And we were able then to portray a black community, which some people looked at with sheer disdain and hatred as a place where most people who banded together did so for their own protection, as we did in forming the Association of Black Journalists [ABJ].
Story_ID: 304529
Speaker 1: That era saw the development of a number of organizations from '68 [1968] on, National Black Police Association [NBPA].
Speaker 2: Certainly did.
Speaker 1: African-American Patrolmen's League [sic. Afro-American Patrolmen's League], the black firefighters in major cities formed unions.  [National Association of] Black Social Workers [NABSW], [Association of] Black Psychologists [ABPsi].
Speaker 2: Indeed.
Speaker 1: [National Alliance of] Black School Educators [NABSE] that was formed in Michigan.  But there's a lot of--all these organizations were formed by black professionals that had so-called good jobs that were you know--
Speaker 2: Well in order to adequately and fairly cover the events to be published in the newspapers, picked up and carried by radio and television, 'cause they all read the newspapers, we had to go do a whole lot of research starting all the way back from [A. Philip] Randolph and the [Brotherhood of] Sleeping Car Porters and, and the [International Brotherhood of] Teamsters and the CIO [Congress of Industrial Organizations; American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO)] and up and around and about.  And during that same era, when [President John Fitzgerald] Kennedy got into office and was able to encourage and help to author the Mental Health and Retardation Act [sic. Maternal and Child Health Retardation Planning Amendments of 1963; Community Mental Health Act of 1963)].  And when [President] Lyndon [Baines] Johnson followed him, some of the funding for the Mental Retardation Act was dropped and--or significantly cut back.  And people were being what they called mainstreamed, being thrown out of the institutions out into the streets.
Story_ID: 304530
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Now let's talk about the founding of NABJ [sic. Association of Black Journalists (ABJ)] in terms of the--who were the--some of the founders?
Speaker 1: Okay.  David Valentine [ph.], a radio reporter at radio KYW [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] was one of the early participants and among the founders.  There were about thirteen of us.
Speaker 2: Was there a principal individual that pooled everybody together or agitated everybody to be involved?
Speaker 1: Well we got to that point, but first we did the regular meetings and we were working on a constitution and some bylaws.
Speaker 2: But, wait a minute now.  Let's go back to that question.  Was there someone who got on the phone and started calling people first?  Whose idea was it to even pull the people together?
Speaker 1: Well Lenny [ph.], my lord, WIP [WTEL, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Well just give us a clue and somebody can research it, you know, give us a good clue.  Where were they?
Speaker 1: He was at WIP.
Speaker 2: WIP?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Metromedia [Inc.], Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now he wasn't a writer or a reporter.  But he was WIP's person of color who they could send out to cover an event as if he were.
Speaker 2: And his name was Lenny?
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh my goodness.
Speaker 2: That's okay.  Lenny's good, I mean there's only one of them there (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's right.
Speaker 2: So if somebody does some research, they'll be able to find.
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 2: So he, he initially, as far as you know, was the person that initially contacted people.
Speaker 1: He contacted me and we in turn contacted some others.  'Cause generally we knew who was having a real hard time, 'cause we chose not to separate ourselves as black newspaper people versus black radio people and black television people, okay.  Many of them were the stars and they were elite, they were way better than we were.
Speaker 2: Or they were getting paid a lot more (laughter).
Speaker 1: Some of 'em weren't getting paid a lot more.  I had been offered position.  I told you the three TVs sent the word out and I did audition tapes for them.  CBS, who I eventually went to work for in Philadelphia.  WPVI[-TV, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] which is CapCities' [Capital Cities Communications] station now and an ABC affiliate.  KYW-TV [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], of course.  And the funny thing about it was that even those who wanted me didn't want me badly enough to pay me well enough to leave my newspaper job [at the Philadelphia Daily News] to go to work for them.
Story_ID: 304531
Speaker 1: But in terms of the people that founded NABJ [sic. Association of Black Journalists (ABJ)].
Speaker 2: Yes (cough).
Speaker 1: Who were some of the others and what were their issues?  I mean what pulled people together?
Speaker 2: All right.  Austin [W.] Culmer [Jr.], C-U-L-M-E-R, was a public information officer at the main post office in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], the only man of color in that whole facility.  And he was a founder.  He was one of the group who came together.  Maurice Sampson [ph.] who had a black advertising firm, which could not place its ads in some of the major daily newspapers; had no access, no entre.  Edith Huggins [Edie Huggins], then a television weather girl at CBS Philadelphia [WCAU-TV, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And then there were those who we very much wanted, we wanted Malcolm Poindexter who was TV at KYW-TV [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Did you get him?
Speaker 2: No.  He and some other folks had to agree to applaud what we were doing and trying to do and would support us they said, but they couldn't go to the meetings and they couldn't join.
Speaker 1: Because they were afraid--
Speaker 2: Of losing their jobs.  And one person did directly and acknowledged by the television station as being fired as too radical.  And that had a chilling effect for some.  So we continued to meet and strategize and draw bylines, make contacts and so on.  The organization grew.
Story_ID: 304532
Speaker 1: Now the forming of all these organizations (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --some of which we've mentioned and many, many more we haven't--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --raise a serious issue of cultural identity.
Speaker 2: Indeed.
Speaker 1: They--that issue is raised.  And there are some that would say that black Americans just happen to be darker people and they, you know, your way out of any bad situations to integrate long enough if you, if you get--if you're persistent enough, you'll be accepted as some kind of American, or accepted as honorary white or something, and that's enough.  Then there are some who would say well I think, I think maybe the employers that were looking at this were saying like are these black people saying that they're part of a people, a group that has interest and has a distinction that's different from the majority of white people here?  Is that what they're saying, you know, by forming a group?  And if they are, then what are the implications of this?
Speaker 2: Well some of it does indeed, the cultural end of that.  There's two different worlds at that time.  If the majority community sneezed, the minority community had pneumonia and nobody was dealing with that.  And so yes, it was necessary to meet and discuss and strategize and pull together.  Now there's huge competition in media about who breaks the story, who's got the story and so on and so on.  We [members of Association of Black Journalists (ABJ)] didn't compromise any of that.  But some of us became known as being able to lead and other reporters started to follow us.  Reporters who were not of color.  And then a guy named Claude Lewis, who was a--became a columnist at the Evening Bulletin [The Bulletin], had considerable weight and was able to finally syndicate his column.  [HistoryMaker] Chuck Stone, whose name you might know, which you surely know.  Chuck became a columnist at the Philadelphia Daily News just before I left the paper as a reporter, as a writing reporter and general assignment reporter.  Chuck came in after his term with Adam Clayton Powell [Jr.], became a columnist at the Daily News, which then had become a Knight Ridder newspaper.  And he was published in other Knight Ridder newspapers.  And we thought, boy that is something.
Story_ID: 304533
Speaker 1: Yeah, [HistoryMaker] Chuck Stone.
Speaker 2: So Chuck Stone came in as you were leaving, you said.
Speaker 1: As I was leaving the newspaper [Philadelphia Daily News].
Speaker 2: Okay, so that's about 1976 (unclear).
Speaker 1: No, I left the newspaper in 1970.  That's the year I joined KYW [Radio, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Oh okay.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Let's see.  Yeah, okay.  So you left the newspaper in 1970.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  So Chuck Stone came in.
Speaker 1: And Chuck came in about '73 [sic. 1972], I guess.
Speaker 2: Okay, and Chuck Stone, he was a--he got a lot of--as a columnist I guess with that kind of exposure, he got a lot of national attention.  I remember--
Speaker 1: Indeed.
Speaker 2: He was an early guest on ['The] Phil Donahue Show' several times.
Speaker 1: Yes.  Chuck Stone as a columnist was able to do some things that we as reporters and writers and journalists could not do, as you know.
Speaker 2: Was he the--one of the first black columnists?
Speaker 1: At Philadelphia Daily News, yes, absolutely.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So he could say things that you call couldn't say--
Speaker 1: You betcha.
Speaker 2: As a news reporter.
Speaker 1: Yes, as a columnist, you can.
Speaker 2: Okay, he can give his opinion.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I think--was Carl Rowan writing his column in those days?
Speaker 1: Carl Rowan indeed was, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.  But in those days it wasn't that many.
Speaker 1: No there weren't that many.
Speaker 2: Like there's not too many now.
Speaker 1: That's true.  Claude Lewis became a columnist at the Evening Bulletin [The Bulletin].  I might have used his name before.
Story_ID: 304534
Speaker 1: Did you all have several points in an agenda that you wanted to accomplish with the National Association of Black Journalists [sic. Association of Black Journalists (ABJ)] when it started?  Did you have like a, like a five-point--these are the things we want to do (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Mission statement, yeah.  When we became Association of Black Journalists, we had a new set of bylines, bylaws.  We had a revised constitution, and we had our duly elected officers.
Speaker 1: Who was the first president?
Speaker 2: Who was the first president?  As I recall it was [HistoryMaker] Acel Moore.  Acel will be in here on Wednesday.  And Acel by the way, years after we got together, became a Pulitzer Prize winner because some of us within that organization started looking at Ford Foundation [New York, New York] and its fellows.  And we started looking at the Pulitzer organization.  And we started looking at the Edward R. Murrow [Foundation]--I believe it's foundation.
Speaker 1: Why?  I mean in what sense?  I mean for money or support or what?
Speaker 2: No, for--it's best described and I, I don't really have a real clear understanding of how old it is and all of that.  I simply don't remember.  But the Edward R. Murrow Award is in broadcast journalism, broadcast journalism.  And I am a holder of one of those from KYW [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] as we covered the nuclear event at Three Mile Island [Dauphin County, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you started, okay--
Speaker 2: But I was trying to name some more names.  Lenny [ph.], Lenny, Lenny, Lenny--
Speaker 1: Three Mile Island was in 1976, right or--
Speaker 2: Seventy-eight [1978] [sic. 1979].
Speaker 1: Seventy-eight [1978]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you received the Edward R. Murrow Foundation Award for--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's called the (laughter)--it's Edward R. Murrow Award--isn't that something?  I've got a block here (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's okay. That's okay, everybody can find it.  I'm sure anybody wants to find that will find it, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it resides at KYW.  There were four of us named in that award.
Story_ID: 304535
Speaker 1: But when you say that you started--that the group [Association of Black Journalists (ABJ)] started looking at the Edward R. Murrow Foundation, what was it looking at it for?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Because some people who were of color who had done some wonderful work.  Their work wasn't reviewed or considered.  It's like the book that was in the--on the curb side that was published in 19, 18, 1920, the Tulsa book.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Some things that should have been published at some papers never saw the light of day.  Papers put them on the spike.  And in newspapering, that means they own the story and you cannot give it away, you can't sell it (laughter), you can't make them print it.
Speaker 1: Was it, was it quite common for the articles of black journalists in those days to be, to be--
Speaker 2: Spiked (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Put on the spike as you say?  Be spiked.
Speaker 2: Yeah it was common, it was common.  And even worse, and I experienced this myself, I had a rewrite person change a quote.
Speaker 1: A quote?
Speaker 2: A quote.
Speaker 1: Well the quote is something that shouldn't--you can't change a quote, can you?
Speaker 2: No (laughter).
Speaker 1: That seems like that's unethical.  But a rewrite person changed a quote.
Speaker 2: And he did not get fired.  And he did not get fired.
Story_ID: 304536
Speaker 1: We had a big hotel across from the--Divine Tracy Hotel in West Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], Father Divine [Reverend Major Jealous Divine] et al. and so on and so forth.  Well across the street from the Divine Tracy was the remnant of an old, prestigious hotel which had been converted into a retirement and nursing facility.  It was an old building.  One night it caught on fire.  Of the more than five hundred residents, one person died.  The thing went up like a tinderbox.  And I was covering, as were many of the rest of us.  But I found the fire commissioner, fire marshal, I'm sorry.  I said, "How could this go up like that in a matter of minutes?"  I mean they were striking alarms like firing a machine gun.  One person lost their life.  The fire marshal told me, he said, "You know," he said, "this is gonna really take some investigation.  I was in the place a couple of weeks ago and I didn't get much past the lobby.  But it looked like a well maintained business to me--building," he said, "to me."  As part of what I wrote, and dictated to rewrite was that fire marshal Joe Doyle [ph.] said, "I was in the place a couple of weeks ago and it looked like a well maintained business to me.  This investigation is really gonna take some time.  But boy isn't it something how all five hundred of those people got out of there and only one person lost a life."  That was magnificent.  So when the quote came out in my story--my byline story along with the rewrite person's byline, it read, "I inspected the place a couple of weeks ago, and it looked like a well maintained building to me."  Left out was, "I didn't go much past the lobby."  "I was in the place," not inspected the place.  He had a whole lot of explaining to do to his boss, the fire commissioner and others, okay.  Insurance matters and all the rest of that stuff (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's a change that--one word that makes a lot of difference.
Speaker 1: And so my story ended up on the spike.  But you can't do that as a rewrite person.  You cannot change a quote (laughter).  In radio, I have to say, "And Mr. [Larry] Crowe, in his own words, says," or I can take a clip off of a tape and play it as part of a story, as you know.  In television we do voiceovers and, you know, all the rest of that stuff.  Recognizing that, it could not wait any longer than we waited to get together to ensure that, that the media was going to simply tell it like it is.  You asked me earlier what was my favorite, that's it: tell it like it is, and we were able to do that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And more, we were able to cause it to be done.  And we were able to teach some people how to do it.
Speaker 2: Through the Association [of Black Journalists (ABJ)].
Speaker 1: Yes sir.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 304537
Speaker 1: We got a federal grant one year because we wanted to round up some young black kids from the public schools and assign them as interns with us, the black reporters through the Association of Black Journalists [ABJ].  And we got a bunch of kids.  I had five assigned to me.  And every time I called roll from wherever my location was, my five kids were in it.  Some of 'em got to meet then [John] Cardinal Krol, the archbishop of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: That's spelled--how do you spell that, Krol?
Speaker 1: Archbishop John Krol, K-R-O-L-L [sic.].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Who didn't always have nice things to say about the minority community.  They were able to meet the mayor and the governor and the--
Speaker 2: Mayor Frank Rizzo?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Mayor Frank Rizzo (laughter).
Speaker 2: I'm sure you had a wonderful relationship with the Rizzo administration.
Speaker 1: Well Frank Rizzo and I came to understand and respect each other.  One time somebody did a--what do you call a story that pokes fun at--it's similar to a column, but--god, I'll say it in a minute.
Speaker 2: Satire?
Speaker 1: Satire.  One of The [Philadelphia] Inquirer's writers did a satire on Frank Rizzo.  Frank Rizzo was so offended that he caused the roofers and the plumbers and some other really bad guys to try to shut The Philadelphia Inquirer newspaper down.  To keep the trucks from hitting the street.  And when that didn't work, Frank Rizzo brought suit against the writer, his newspaper, bah, bah, bah.  I was a reporter at the time and we went to sit in on that trial.  And reporters generally had the run of the courtroom.  We sat in the jury box.  And Frank Rizzo went into a tirade about the media and said, and I quote, as I remember it very well, "There's one reporter, only one reporter in this room who can be relied upon to be fair and impartial.  And I don't know if it helps him or hurts him, but it's Joe Donovan [HistoryMaker Joseph Donovan]."
Speaker 2: Well that's an interesting remark.  Some people in the community that, you know in the black community would consider that a kiss of death or something, you know, but--
Speaker 1: He said, "I don't know if it helps him or hurts him, but in my dealings with him, he's been imminently fair."
Speaker 2: Okay, that's quite a complement, I guess.
Speaker 1: And I said some things about Frank Rizzo that Frank Rizzo didn't like.  See when I was a police reporter, I told him that, "Look if your police beat up anymore school children demonstrating, and I'm there to hear what you said when you gave that command, I'm gonna publish it."
Story_ID: 304538
Speaker 1: The high point was when we [members of Association of Black Journalists (ABJ)] first started to meet, and we all had our jobs there.  Some of us wondered why there was only one of me there.  And broadcasters and editors alike said, "We'd hire some more but we can't find any qualified."  So we said, "We will find some for you."  And then began to be recognized as a force which had its target and was not gonna be turned around.  That's why we got the federal grant to have the summer [internship] program for the youngsters and at the same time we were actively recruiting other blacks, some from black newspapers who had applied to the major newspapers and been turned down.  We were able to go to Lincoln University [Lincoln University, Pennsylvania] and get our station at least as one, to donate our old tape machines for the students in radio, television at Lincoln University would have something to work with and on.  And then we were able to get a group from KYW station [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], including the news director and managing editor to go up to Lincoln with us once every month as visiting professors, so-called (laughter).
Story_ID: 304539
Speaker 1: I wanted to backtrack a little bit to ask you about a book that was a major work by another black journalist.  There's probably some, several, but the one I remember I mean that really had a tremendous impact in the early '70s [1970s] was a book called 'The Choice[: The Issue of Black Survival in America]' By Samuel F. Yette [HistoryMaker Samuel Yette], Y-E-T-T-E.
Speaker 2: That one I don't know.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I'm surprised.
Speaker 1: He teaches journalism now at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The book had a tremendous impact on people in the early '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: 'Souls On Ice' [Eldridge Cleaver] had a whole lot of impact.  Remember that one? Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I remember 'Soul,' yeah.  But 'The Choice' was by a journalist, that's why I--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And he was a reporter for Newsweek.  He talked about how he got picked up by Newsweek because he was black and they sent him out to the riots and, you know, he started with the Dayton Journal-Herald [The Journal-Herald; Dayton Daily News], I think, as a news reporter.  Then he ended up at Newsweek and then he, you know, now teaches at Howard.  But I just wondered if you had any comments about that.  Was he a member of--was he a founding member?
Speaker 2: No.  No, I would certainly have remembered his name.
Speaker 1: Do you remember Lu Palmer [HistoryMaker Lutrelle "Lu" F. Palmer, II] from Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right. Okay, he passed away last year.  [HistoryMaker] Vernon Jarrett?
Speaker 2: Vernon Jarrett, yes he was a Ford [Foundation] fellow on the board of the Ford fellowship thing that I was--became part of with [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Paul] Brock.
Speaker 1: Mr. Paul Brock, right.
Speaker 2: Mr. Paul Brock.
Speaker 1: Tony Brown.  I know Paul Brock was producing 'Tony Brown's Journal' at one time.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What about Tony Brown, was he a part of--
Speaker 2: No, he was not a card-carrying, participating member, but he attended every convention we had.
Story_ID: 304540
Speaker 1: Now did the National Association of Black Journalists [sic. Association of Black Journalists (ABJ)] appeal primarily to the black journalists in the major newspapers, the white-owned papers?  Or did the black press participate at an equally, you know, high level.
Speaker 2: As you know, we are a strange people in many ways.
Speaker 1: Our situation is certainly strange.
Speaker 2: Well, it relates to some people who get in would rather not see others in.  Some people pull their brightest children out of the public schools and send them to Catholic schools.  And, those who can afford it, even to private schools because some of our schools are so ragged and so understaffed and now we've got the, the dope stuff out of control in this country.  So that we had to do a whole lot of working with the movers and shakers.  Walter Annenberg was one of them.  Walter Annenberg then had The Philadelphia Inquirer, which he inherited from his father [Moses Annenberg].  And Walter Annenberg and his philanthropy founded the Annenberg School of Communications [Annenberg School for Communication] at the University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: They also--they fund a lot of documentaries.  Quite a few projects, Annenberg (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You betcha, you betcha.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they [Annenberg/Corporation for Public Broadcasting; Annenberg Learner] funded the Ali Mazrui's Africa television series ['The Africans: A Triple Heritage'], for instance.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: Quite a few other things.  But I was asking like what was the participation of the black-owned papers, like the [Philadelphia] Afro-American [Afro American Newspapers], the Pittsburgh Courier [New Pittsburgh Courier], the [Chicago] Defender.
Speaker 2: They did not participate with us.
Speaker 1: [New York] Amsterdam News.
Speaker 2: And would not participate with us in the early days, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they would not, or were they not invited?
Speaker 2: They were invited, but they did not choose to participate.  Some of 'em said we were too radical, others said we were stolies [ph.].  Others said we were the black elite.
Speaker 1: So have things changed since those days?
Speaker 2: Oh indeed, sure.  One of our past presidents of the Philadelphia ABJ [Philadelphia Association of Black Journalists (PABJ)] was a former columnist and editor at the oldest black newspaper, The Philadelphia Tribune, right up until we, within the organization--(coughing) excuse me--were able to impress Pamela Haines to consider leaving her editor's position at the black newspaper to come and be an editor at KYW Newsradio [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  She also was a regular participant on the panel at 'Black Perspective[s] on the News.'  We used the 'Meet the Press' format, if you will.
Story_ID: 304541
Speaker 1: Can you tell us now, how did, just, I guess to move away from NABJ [sic. Association of Black Journalists (ABJ)] for a minute.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You--we before we came, we kind of backtracked to NABJ, you mentioned this Ford [Foundation] fellowship in '76 [1976].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And this preceded 'Black Perspective[s] on the News,' right?
Speaker 2: No, that was after.
Speaker 1: It was after.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: So let's go to 'Black Perspective on the News' then.  How did 'Black Perspective on the News' get started and--
Speaker 2: Again, our group and, and others who we had picked up as allies went to the public broadcasting station, WHYY[-TV, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Now what year was this?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy [1970], 1970.  The same year I went to radio station [KYW, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Okay now--all right in 1970?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Okay, 1970, all right.  And WHYY agreed to--
Speaker 2: WHYY.
Speaker 1: They agreed to--
Speaker 2: PBS Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: In Philadelphia.
Speaker 2: We were able to convince the vice president and general manager that we had a show that we wanted to air.  We wanted to air half hour show, 'Meet the Press' format, because even though some of us were in major media, we were keenly aware and became keenly aware and would press our point that there is a black perspective on the news.  And it could attract people like then U.S. secretary of agriculture whose name was Schwab [sic.], to come on the show and face our panel because there were funds being cut back that were impacting small black family farms far more severely than anything else.  So that is, is the caliber, okay?  We also had--
Speaker 1: Now did you have a regular set of panelists?  I mean how was the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was a regular panelist.
Speaker 1: So it started in 1970.  Who was the host and what was the panel, and--
Speaker 2: At the time that we first started doing it, we had three different hosts.  Reggie Bryant was one, and Reggie was among the founders of Black Communicators [Associated Inc., Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  I was offered the show to co-produce and to co-produce and re--and main--and retain or maintain as a regular panelist on 'Black Perspective on the News.'
Speaker 1: Okay so you were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There were five of us who were regulars always.
Speaker 1: So did you co-produce it?
Speaker 2: No (laughter).
Speaker 1: But you were a regular panelist.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I was offered to take the show, my Westinghouse Broadcasting [Company; Group W] people told me that I needed to read my contract, which I had with them, which essentially said things like they owned all of my time, all of my work product and every thought in my head.  And they said, "No, you can't do it."
Speaker 1: You could appear on the show, but you couldn't be the host.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Story_ID: 304542
Speaker 1: --Else was on the show ['Black Perspectives on the News'] that we might know?  You said Reggie Bryant was one of the hosts.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You were on the show, you were a panelist, and you mentioned a young lady from the--
Speaker 2: Pam Haines [Pamela Haines] was a regular panelist from the black newspaper.
Speaker 1: The Philadelphia Inquirer, right?
Speaker 2: No, The Philadelphia Tribune was the black newspaper (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tribune, I'm sorry, my fault.
Speaker 2: That's it, that's okay.
Speaker 1: And who else?  Was that it?
Speaker 2: Those are the ones that come immediately to mind.
Speaker 1: Did you have guest panelists that would come in?
Speaker 2: Oh indeed, sure, sure.  But the distinction was that all of the hosts and all of the panel were black.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were they all from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: No, we had a couple from Camden, New Jersey, from the Camden Courier-Post.  We had Jim McDonald [ph.] from New York [New York] participate with us.
Speaker 1: Who was he with, Jim McDonald?
Speaker 2: He was with Public Broadcasting [Service (PBS)] in New York.  I'm trying to remember its call letters and, and--
Speaker 1: WNET [Newark, New Jersey]?
Speaker 2: I believe, yeah I believe it was.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I believe it was.
Story_ID: 304543
Speaker 1: In any event, we were able to take the show on the road from time to time to different places and do a 'Black Perspective[s on the News]' from there.  One such series we did took us to Boston [Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: WGBH[-TV, Boston, Massachusetts], yeah.
Speaker 1: WGBH loaned us their facilities to do the show.  Went out to Los Angeles, California; San Francisco, California, went to--oh we were all over the place (laughter).  But because of what we did, okay, what led to taking the show on the road was that, that WHYY[-TV, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], PBS [Public Broadcasting Service] in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], found that the show was so popular that it actually generated ratings and had a share.  And then it was offered to other PBS stations.  And at its high point, 'Black Perspective on the News' had 107 PBS stations airing 'Black Perspective on the News.'  Pretty heady stuff.  The only show coming out of Philadelphia, WHYY PBS with that kind of reputation, appeal, acceptance, if you will.  Public broadcasting stations always need good material, and they're supposed to be public broadcasting stations.  And so we, the Black Communicators Associated [Inc., Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] before we became the ABJ [Association of Black Journalists], okay, were able to move in some circles among the broadcasters, remind them of their responsibilities and we learned--sure we got some camera people, cinematographers who happened to be black.  We got them on board at Westinghouse [Broadcasting Company; Group W] and at CBS and at ABC.  And some of them were so good that we were able to pull film in those days that would illustrate a black perspective that we were talking about, okay.  We could show the tenement housing that people were living in which helped to spark the urban riots.  We were able to absolutely show some of that stuff.  And at the same time we were able to show some blacks in business doing so well with large conference rooms, very nice offices and holdings and such.  So that through ABJ and others who joined in with us and so on, we were able to help change the attitudes of some people who were uninformed.
Story_ID: 304544
Speaker 1: Just having lived through that era, and I was a young man in those days, in the early '70s [1970s], or the mid-'70s [1970s].  It seemed like we were in a golden age of communication for some reason.  We had like mutual black radio, we had 'Black Perspective[s] on the News,' Tony Brown's, I mean 'Black Journal' [sic. 'Tony Brown's Journal'] was on television.
Speaker 2: All of that came later (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We had Black World [Negro Digest], [The] Black Scholar magazine, Black Books Bulletin.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: You had 'Black News' [WNEW-TV] out of New York [New York].  The, the black newspapers were doing pretty good work.  You know a lot of--[HistoryMaker Lutrelle] "Lu" [F.] Palmer [II] had his radio show ['Lu's Notebook'] in Chicago [Illinois].  I mean it just seemed like there's a lot--a golden age of information about what was going on worldwide.  Even Jet seemed to have more information about what was going on, hardcore political information than they ever had before.  Do you share that--do you think that's true?
Speaker 2: Yes, those were the heady days.
Speaker 1: Black Enterprise started up then.
Speaker 2: Indeed.
Speaker 1: All the different black magazines that are no longer out were cranking up then.  Encore, I think.
Speaker 2: Well yes.  But please remember and recall if you will, the major corporations and institutions if you will, which profess they--an interest in equal and civil rights.  When you went in their waiting room, there might be a Jet magazine.  There might be an Ebony magazine.  And that was as much as they knew about the black community.  Now if you go and you find Black Enterprise, okay.
Speaker 1: So you think things are better now than they were then in terms of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Certainly they're better, certainly they're better.  You see if all the children see are singers and dancers, entertainers that may be the limit of their view of the world.
Speaker 1: Well one might say that today that's what we see pretty much (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) See a lot of it, don't we?
Speaker 1: (Unclear) I don't know if it's better.  I mean are you sure it's better now?
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm absolutely certain it's better because also at the same time we have 'Tony Brown's Journal' on the air.
Story_ID: 304545
Speaker 1: In Chicago [Illinois] it's ['Tony Brown's Journal'] on at 5:30 in the morning.  Nobody sees it.
Speaker 2: Interesting thing about--oh I didn't tell you yet about 'Black Edition,' Edition.  Some people called it Black Addition and Subtraction, derisively.
Speaker 1: Okay Black Addition with an A?
Speaker 2: Edition, E-D-I-T-I-O-N.
Speaker 1: Edition.
Speaker 2: Edition.  I was co-host of that show with Malcolm Poindexter.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's--was that local Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: That was yes, local Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: And that was on at the same time?
Speaker 2: No, we started out on Saturday afternoon.
Speaker 1: I mean it was during the same years or was it earlier?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah that was after I went to KYW radio [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] in 1970.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the show with its magazine format for television gained such wide acceptance among the viewers who were black, white, (laughter) red, yellow, red and yellow, black and white, have very wide appeal and did generate ratings even though it was a lead-in to the then five o'clock news.  No, six o'clock news, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it was actually on before the, the six o'clock news.
Speaker 2: On before the six o'clock news.  We were a lead-in to the six o'clock news.
Speaker 1: Well that's what I was referring to when I said that 'Tony Brown's Journal' in Chicago was broadcast at 5:30 A.M. (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Five o'clock in the morning.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 5:30 A.M.
Speaker 2: Well when we first--
Speaker 1: Black--what's the one with [HistoryMaker] Julian Bond.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's on at 5:30, six o'clock in the morning.  It's--I mean doesn't have a prime time--it seems to me that black issue-oriented broadcasting is on so--either real early in the morning or real late at night.
Speaker 2: And that's a part of the challenge facing the NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists] today.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's one of the challenges you have to deal with.
Speaker 2: Oh indeed, indeed.  We started out airing on Saturday at ten o'clock in the morning.  Who the heck is looking at television ten o'clock Saturday morning except the kids and the cartoons, with the cartoons (laughter)?
Speaker 1: But it's better than 5:30 a.m.
Speaker 2: Well, yes.  But, as we grew and start to generate ratings and a share, then we went to primetime as a lead-in to the six o'clock news.  Primetime on Wednesday we aired.  A little half hour.
Speaker 1: Now how long did you stay on the air doing that?
Speaker 2: Four years with that.
Story_ID: 304546
Speaker 1: Tell me, now, 'Black Perspective[s] on the News' is no longer on.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: And neither is the show you just described or any (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Neither is 'Black Edition.'
Speaker 1: Not even with another cast or crew of people.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: It's just, it's off now.
Speaker 2: Gone.
Speaker 1: And can you discuss, you know I mean why did those shows--is there something to take its place now?  Are there shows to take the place of those shows?
Speaker 2: With 'Black Edition,' 'Black Edition' was dropped off the air but under some pressure from some people who said, "If you want your license to broadcast, you better, 'cause the airways belong to the people.  You have a responsibility."
Speaker 1: The FCC [Federal Communications Commission] had rules that compelled stations to carry--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --public interest broadcasting--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --at one time, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But those rules are not in place anymore, right?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And one of our own [HistoryMaker Reverend Benjamin Hooks] under President [Richard Milhous] Nixon was named to the FCC and became its chair, and began to dismantle the licensing requirements that broadcasters must use the people's airwaves in the people's interest.  And broadcasting at that time was evolving more toward blood and guts and accidents and mayhem.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And if you were black, the way to get on television was go hold somebody up, go rob somebody, this, that or the other thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Or hit the mayor's car with your car and run (laughter).  That will get you on television.
Speaker 1: In Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], it might get you more than that.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) At one time indeed it did.
Speaker 1: In those days, yeah.
Speaker 2: At one time it did.  But some of us who were reporters of color and columnists of color, when we caught the police doing something they shouldn't have been doing, we told it, told on 'em.  I was one day suited as I am now, had been down to the Philadelphia waterfront and (coughing) returning to the station which was five blocks from there, walked through what was called Society Hill [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], which had been gentrified.  And there's gentrification going on right now under our very noses.
Story_ID: 304547
Speaker 1: A gentrified neighborhood [Society Hill, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], upscale, decidedly upscale, which began five blocks around the corner from Mother Bethel [A.M.E.] Church [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], which used to be the stop for the Underground Railroad.
Speaker 2: The blackest part of town at one time, yes.
Speaker 1: The oldest black-owned piece of real estate in the country.  And so a part of our 'Black Perspective[s] on the News' and 'Black Edition' dealt with how some people were just taking away the history, uprooting the people.  And we went through that period in housing when we used to build high-rise projects, keep 'em all together (laughter).  And later we found that was no way for kids to grow up.  Bill Cosby grew up around the corner from one of the oldest public housing projects in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And Bill Cosby created 'Fat Albert [and the Cosby Kids'].  Bill Cosby's doing some really fine television work.  And Bill Cosby is also causing a whole lot of controversy when he says, you know, some of the victims are, are responsible for their own fate.  'Cause as a people, we, some of us, many of us, still have a tendency to outgrow ourselves and our community.  Sometimes we forget where we came from and how we came.  It's part of why we're doing what we're doing right now.  I don't want it forgotten.  That there was an organization began about thirty years ago, yeah, little more than thirty years ago, that said we're going to get a better shake.  And it was the 400 Ministers in Philadelphia that was putting pressure on The [Philadelphia] Inquirer, the [Philadelphia] Daily News and the [Evening] Bulletin [The Bulletin].  And that pressure that four hundred respected ministers were putting on was nothing widely reported or known of, okay.  But it did make it possible for me to go to the Philadelphia Daily News as a display ad coordinator, and later become a librarian and a writing reporter.  There were reporters who didn't know how to write, who weren't good at that.  So they had to call in on deadline and give their story to rewrite.  I wrote my own.  I wrote my own and I phoned it in to a rewrite man who changed a quote in it (laughter).
Speaker 2: What you're saying, your point was--is that the--a lot of people who got important jobs in media, a lot of black people that did, owed it to the agitation from people in the community--I mean, grass roots (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well some of it--some of it was agitation, but not a lot.
Story_ID: 304548
Speaker 1: I'll tell you, I said to you before, and I'm going to say it again 'cause it is very important.  There were people in the black community in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], which before I went to the Philadelphia Daily News, only bought that tabloid newspaper to see whether the figure in Nancy's ear was a six or a nine as they played their numbers (laughter).
Speaker 2: I never knew that was an issue about--
Speaker 1: Which had nothing to do with what the number was.  And if too many people hit the number in a certain location, they changed the number.
Speaker 2: By 'Nancy' you're talking to--about the comic strip (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The comic strip 'Nancy,' yes.
Speaker 2: The Ernie Bushmiller comic strip 'Nancy.'
Speaker 1: Yes, yes (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.  Some black people will say, "What are you talking about?"
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So we were able to through coverage of a community, earn its respect and they started buying the paper for other reasons than to see what the number was gonna be.  They started buying the paper 'cause they could read themselves, about themselves and see their pictures when they had not hurt anybody, not killed anybody, not held anybody up, not hit the mayor's car and run, okay.  And, and that same thing spread to the larger community.  We were a respected journal.  We became a respected journal.
Story_ID: 304549
Speaker 1: Tell us about Westinghouse [Broadcasting Company; Group W].  What happened--now, when did you go to Westinghouse?
Speaker 2: Went to Westinghouse in 1970.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay so you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) After ten years at the [Philadelphia] Daily News--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I went there in '60 [1960].
Speaker 1: All right, so, 1970 you were at Westinghouse and that's when--that's W, that's Y--
Speaker 2: That's KYW [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: KYW radio, okay.
Speaker 2: All news, all the time.
Speaker 1: That's the Westinghouse station.  And you were there until 1970--
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-eight [1978].
Speaker 1: --eight [1978], okay.
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-nine [1979].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then you went to CBS.
Speaker 2: And then yes, I left them and went to CBS.
Speaker 1: Was this a local affiliate in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Yes, CBS-owned and operated station WCAU[-TV, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], Channel 10.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I went there as assignment manager instead of assignment editor, 'cause the money they had to pay me, they didn't pay assignment editors, so they had to create a new classification.
Speaker 1: Okay, you were there from 1978.
Speaker 2: Seventy-eight [1978] 'til--
Speaker 1: I think, you said you left to join the EPA [U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And when was that?
Speaker 2: That was, let's see--
Speaker 1: Was that before the [President Ronald Wilson] Reagan administration, or--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Reagan was 1980, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it would have been 1980, yeah.
Story_ID: 304550
Speaker 1: So what did you do for EPA [U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]?
Speaker 2: I was its regional Superfund information officer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And was this a national level job or local?
Speaker 2: Regional.
Speaker 1: Regional.
Speaker 2: Six (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Regional, right.
Speaker 2: --there's ten EPA regions.  The Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] region where I was had jurisdiction over Superfund in six states and the District of Columbia [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: This was from 1980 to what?
Speaker 2: Eighty [1980] 'til '90 [1990].  I stayed with them for ten years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now was this--how was working for EPA different from working for the other media?  You know you were involved in--
Speaker 2: Working for EPA was different in that I was no longer, according to its bylaws, permitted to be a participating member of the Association of Black Journalists [ABJ], closed to journalists only.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, but in the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I was no longer a working journalist.
Speaker 1: But in the beginning the association included all kinds of PR [public relations] writers and--
Speaker 2: You betcha, you betcha.
Speaker 1: So it was closed up by that time to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you see the thing that is to me troublesome and has been since its inception, when we went from Black Communicators Associated [Inc., Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], and became the Association of Black Journalists, and rewrote the bylaws and the constitution and whatnot, voting membership was limited to working journalists.  And the other communicators could participate but they couldn't vote.  They had no real rights.  They were not being represented against the powerful and racist attitudes which were not only prevalent in the media, that's why the black social workers had to get together and so and so on.  That story we know well.  But yes, I was sorry to find that I could no longer participate, not even as a nonvoting member 'cause I wasn't a journalist anymore.
Story_ID: 304551
Speaker 1: You were there [U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)] from 1980 to 1990.
Speaker 2: Yep (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean, why did you leave journalism as such? I mean, what was it--
Speaker 2: I left CBS [WCAU-TV, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], which was my last media job, because as assignment manager, and some other management policy divisions, or positions I should say, I had a lot of professional concern.  There was a lot of racism.  I had a lot of professional concern about that.  And we talked and we talked 'til people got tired of talking to me and then we had to go to CBS [Building], which we called Black Rock, in New York [New York].  And somebody explained to me in certain terms, "Joe [HistoryMaker Joseph Donovan], we don't disagree with you.  We won't argue with you, though.  But it is not going to change.  So why don't you just tuck it in?"  Didn't disagree with me.  Didn't disrespect me.  But wouldn't argue with me.  We couldn't even have an argument.  And it's those kinds of things that NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists] has to--that's part of the challenge ahead of us, dealing with stuff like that.  So I said, "Well, you know I will exercise others of my options," and I went to EPA and became the regional biggie in Superfund because first of all the Superfund was very new and people didn't know much about it.  But they did know about hazardous waste sites and they did know about polychlorinated biphenyls being (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What are those now?  I mean you're telling me something that people know about, but I don't know what one is.
Speaker 2: Polychlorinated biphenyls is an insulating material, outlawed now, outlawed now, we don't make it any more like we don't make DDT any more.
Story_ID: 304552
Speaker 1: Polychlorinated biphenyls--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --are a manmade chemical additive to oil to make it fire resistant.  It was most commonly used on utility poles with the electrical lines running past, until such time as it was found that lightening could strike those boxes, break 'em open, release this PCB-treated oil, and it was hazardous.  It causes cancer in laboratory animals.  Has long been suspected as a carcinogen of human beings, cancer causer.  So it was outlawed, but because we have such a stockpile of it, a lot of its sitting in old abandoned warehouses in minority and other poor neighborhoods, leaking materials.  Then they had the Superfund [U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)] which was to clean up the hazardous waste sites across this country.  And I was information officer for region three, so that when we went to Huntington, Virginia--Huntington, West Virginia, there was somebody who would go to the minority community and the other poor communities, both there and in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and we'd do it in New York, we'd do it wherever, okay.  So because I am a communicator and retired journalist, I know what community relations is and community relations was mandated in the Superfund Act [Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980].
Speaker 2: Okay, so I get a picture now.
Speaker 1: By law.
Speaker 2: Okay, I get a picture of what you did.
Speaker 1: And a lot of people didn't know what community relations was, they thought it was public relations and they thought it was citizen participation.  It wasn't either of those things.  It was a whole new discipline.
Speaker 2: Well what is it?  What would you say it is?
Speaker 1: It is community relations.  It is not public relations, but it involves the public.  It is not, oh, it is not public relations, it is not citizen participation.  It is an activity which requires a community relations director to go, for example, to Las Cruces, New Mexico where there's some hazardous materials and whatnot.  People are upset and aroused.  So you go into the community and you assess the community and you talk to the undertaker and the minister and you get to know the community and you visit churches and so on.  And then you call an information meeting so the people can understand what they're facing.  The nightmare of that was I'm sure you remember this one, Love Canal [Niagara Falls, New York].
Speaker 2: Right.  Right, in New York.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, Love Canal.  And now they're selling houses in Love Canal once again, but they can't get what they used to get for those houses.
Story_ID: 304553
Speaker 1: You were there [U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)] until 1990.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Then in 1990 you went to Waste Management [Inc.].
Speaker 2: Yes sir.
Speaker 1: Now what was your job title at Waste Management?
Speaker 2: I was director of community relations, corporate director of community relations for the entire corporation.
Speaker 1: And so what did you do (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And our principal work was collection and hauling of trash to be incinerated or landfilled.  I was its first director of community relations and its first corporate person of color.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And corporation consist of 144 operating facilities in forty-eight states.  I was based in Lisle, Illinois, and our principal offices were in Oak Brook [Illinois].
Speaker 1: That's near McDonald's headquarters, right?
Speaker 2: You betcha.
Speaker 1: So Waste Management and McDonald's are in the same neighborhood.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes sir, yes, neighbors.  And became good neighbors because patterning after their McDonald's Hamburger U [Hamburger University, Oak Brook, Illinois], we worked together with the University of Illinois [sic.] and developed a Landfill University [Lisle, Illinois] housed at one of the colleges and developed a chair so that our young landfill managers could better learn how to operate in this confused world when you said trash people thought the garbage barge (laughter) sailing the high seas with its contaminated cargo, which when they couldn't find a place to pull into port to get rid of it, they sailed to Haiti and began to offload that stuff in that impoverished nation.  And that makes people mad, and it makes 'em scared.  So somebody's got to communicate.  And it's got to be somebody who has integrity and can be believed.  And that's why I was sore about not being able to be an active participating member, voting member, or even welcomed.  So challenges still ahead of us as a people.  Gentrification impacts our old folks and our young folks and will for generations to come.

Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: (Pause) That we will recognize and support our leaders, male and female, of color.
Speaker 1: Is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: Actually yes, I would have stayed in mainstream media.  And I would look to maybe get a PBS [Public Broadcasting Service] station and become its vice president and general manager, and get some real good stuff back on PBS.  Stuff that other PBS stations might pick up and carry as they did 'Black Perspective[s] on the News.'  But that takes some real doing.  The PBS radio station in Washington, D.C. is off the air, for Pete's sake, jazz station.
Speaker 1: It's off the air?
Speaker 2: Off the air.  We still have ours here in Atlanta [Georgia], on the Clark Atlanta [University] campus.  And Morris Brown [College, Atlanta, Georgia] is now discredited and almost shut.

Speaker 1: Likewise when you look back at everything you've done to this point, what would you consider today to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Being one of the founders of the Association of Black Journalists [ABJ] 'cause, Mr. [Larry] Crowe, we turned the media activity nationwide, and turned it upside down and shook it.  Black journalists did that.  We communicated.  That was our work.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA INTERRUPTION)

Speaker 1: Do you have children and grandchildren?  I think you mentioned that at one point.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell us about your family.
Speaker 2: I have one ex-wife [Helen Richardson] and one soon to be ex-wife [Wanda Lawrence] (laughter).  Of my first wife and my union were born--well she brought one child into our marriage who was then four years old, and three years later our daughter [Joelen Donovan-Gray] was born.  She's now thirty--born in 1970, she's now thirty-five.  And she and her husband [Walter Gray] have two children [Giana Gray (ph.) and Aaron Gray (ph.)].  My first two grandbabies.  I have the--I have three stepchildren with my second wife, two girls and a boy.  The youngest of whom is forty-two and the eldest of whom is forty-five.  And among them, they brought, brought nine more children into the family.  So I have eleven grandbabies.  And part of what I want to leave when I cross over, is knowledge that I had some work to do, and joined with others and formed a na- what has become a national organization [National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ)], of which I am fiercely proud.  Pleased to have been part of it coming together.  And so we call that legacy.  See in the old days, we used to just have the griot.  You remember the griot.  Well that was before we got into newspaper, radio and television.  And with the coming of the computer, now we can publish books.
Story_ID: 304557
Speaker 1: Is there anything we haven't asked you that, that we need to talk about before we ask our last question?
Speaker 2: Well one very important book has yet to be written about all the stuff we've talked about here.  There's been snatches here and there.  I once had a publisher committed to publishing a work that I had written.  And they were good to me.  I mean, you know, I got my advances and I was able to do my first edit and so on and so on.  As you may have picked up by now, I can become very wordy, and my book was too long.  And I couldn't for the life of me figure out how to not say something that I'd already said, you know.  How do you do that?  I couldn't figure it out.  So I destroyed it, and they allowed me to keep my advance.  I worked real hard on that.  It was called 'The Magic Word' [ph.].
Speaker 1: Was it about black journalists?
Speaker 2: No, no, it was about (laughter) G.I.s in the United States Air Force who didn't know what would happen when they called someone of color the N word.  That was the magic word.
Story_ID: 304558
Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would love to be remembered as a professional communicator, seasoned over thirty years, who did what he could and would, should is no longer in my vocabulary.  For many of us it is a whipping word.  So I want the young people coming along to develop some initiative, some courage, and some real industry.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We don't have a black astronaut on Discovery [space shuttle] or at the [International] Space Station, but we did have a black female.  You had to look long to find her name.  Do you remember her?  [Mae] Jemison (laughter).
