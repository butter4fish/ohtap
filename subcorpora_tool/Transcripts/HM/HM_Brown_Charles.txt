Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Sir, could you please state your name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My name is [HistoryMaker] Charles Brown, C-H-A-R-L-E-S, B-R-O-W-N.
Speaker 1: Right.  Now do you have a middle name?
Speaker 2: I have a middle name, yes.  My name is, middle name is Edward, E-D-W-A-R-D.
Speaker 1: And do you have any nicknames?
Speaker 2: Sweet Charlie Brown.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: February 24, 1936, Canton, Mississippi, which is about thirty miles from Jackson [Mississippi].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm retired.  I'm what do you say a mommy, daddy.  I have two teenage--two teenagers, a boy Ryan [ph.] who is nineteen years old just recently graduated from high school and I have a daughter Rosalind [ph.] who is fifteen years old and going into her sophomore year in the public schools here in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now in terms of occupation, would you say that you worked in athletics, is that what you would say?
Speaker 2: Well, I had several, several occupations.  Primarily when I attended school, I was a physical education major, changing that after my second year to general education because I found out I wanted to be a teacher.  And that is what I've been leaning toward you know throughout life.  I came out of the armed services, the United States Army and I went into the school system.  Found out that I didn't wanna be confined, but I wanted to teach.  So I did it in a different way.  The YMCA of Metropolitan Chicago was making a decision as to whether or not they were going to stay in Chicago in the in-house capacity, the buildings, where they would program the youngsters or whatever program they had on an in-building situation.  And they found out that they was not gonna work in that way so they formed a group called the "detached workers."  That was eight guys, eight or nine, that were placed throughout the city.  Not much training, there was no books on it.  But some of the program had been started in New York City [New York, New York] but we would reach out to the young people in the community and I hate to stigmatize our operation so many people they called us gang workers but like I said that would be a stigmatism and not real description of what we did.  We were more community workers because there was no way that you could operate with these young people without working with the entire community.  So we worked with the young people in the community organizing them in positive programs, also to hopefully steer them you know back to education and whatever program was necessary that you could do, you could--to keep them from the negative activities because most of all our programs were operated in areas where there were high crime, low-income, low social economic groups.  So the families that we are--that we worked with you know they're the ones that needed it most so that's why we were there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I just wanted to get a description of what you did for a living--what you did for (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was my beginning.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was a very early beginning.
Speaker 1: We're gonna get in the interview.  But I just wanted to get a one word description of what your occupation was.
Speaker 2: Okay, well I couldn't do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's impossible.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is August 31st, 2004.
Speaker 1: And where are we at present time?
Speaker 2: We are at The HistoryMakers' house.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Nineteen-- 1900 South Michigan [Avenue] in Chicago.
Story_ID: 269922
Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions that they make me ask everybody, and they're warm-up questions and they only require a short answer and the first one is sir, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: (Laughter)  What is my favorite food?  My favorite food I can't even eat any more.  I'm allergic to chicken.
Speaker 1: Allergic to chicken?
Speaker 2: And fish.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's all I ate for fifteen years.  I guess that was the reason.  And you wanted a short answer, but I'm sorry, that, that, that's my answer.
Speaker 1: That's odd.  But do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Oh summertime.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last question is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Well the one that I try to adhere to and I think of and this is off the top of my head.  I was coined by Chicago [Illinois] disc jockey years and years ago by [HistoryMaker Holmes] "Daddy-O" Daylie.  And I always remembered it, he would say, "Live it and love it and make the best of it."  And I find that if you apply that to many situations you can get through them no matter what the issue.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 269923
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about your family history.  I'm gonna ask you about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Reginald Robinson] side of the family.  But we'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Ruby McClure Brown, R-U-B-Y, M-C-C-L-U-R-E, B-R-O-W-N.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Canton--date of birth first is July 11, 1915, Canton, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what do you know about her side of the family?  How far back can you trace your ancestors on that side?
Speaker 2: On my grandmother's side which is on my mother's, my mother's mother, I can only go back to what I've been told and that's to Canton, Mississippi when she was a young lady.  My grandmother was black; my grandfather on my mother's side was white.  He was a farmer in Mississippi and he had several children.  My mother had three, four brothers and three sisters.  And if that's all you wanna know about my mother's side, that's about as much as I can tell you so far as my ancestors are concerned,--
Speaker 1: Now, hmmm.
Speaker 2: --but my grandfather on my mother's side he was a farmer in Mississippi, but he relocated from Iowa to Mississippi.  And he's a very strong, strong influence on my mother.  He provided her with very strong educational background.  She attended Madison County Training School [ph.].  She was the oldest of her family.  She basically was a mother to all of her brothers and sisters.
Speaker 1: Okay now your, your grandfather you said he, he was white and he was from Iowa (cough)?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Are there any stories about, about him because I know it must have been--must not have been easy for him to--
Speaker 2: No it wasn't.
Speaker 1: --go to Mississippi and, and have black children in Mississippi you know so.
Speaker 2: No it wasn't because he had white children and black children.  And that was difficult.  Eventually he moved to Chicago [Illinois] where he died with my mother and us and his nephew.  We were always a, a family a very close family.  And from the time that we--what I can remember, we never separated the black part of our family from the white part.  We were a family period.  And I was only six months old when I came from Canton, Mississippi to Chicago.  So I didn't know very much about the situation in the South except what was told to me and what I learned in Chicago.  Of course I learned more about racism in Chicago than I ever did in the South because I wasn't there but I found that the racism here was different.  I never went back to Canton, Mississippi until the 1970s.  So I really had no experience in the South as a young person.
Story_ID: 269924
Speaker 1: Now did your relatives talk about Mississippi?  Did they compare it to Chicago [Illinois] or talk about--
Speaker 2: All the time, all the time, all the time.  We talked about the experiences that they had as young people and the situations they had to deal with, with my father [Reginald Brown] and his father-in-law, which was my grandfather, and I guess you have to understand that my father, my mother's [Ruby McClure Brown] husband, was the favorite son of my mother's father and from the descriptions that I get now, you see the two--my mother and father were the oldest in each of their families.  My father was the oldest of fourteen children, seven boys and seven girls.  My mother was the oldest in her family.  So basically they were like the mom and the pop of each of their families even though they had strong parents on each side and I was fortunate enough to know both my mother, my mother's mother and father and my father's mother [Ida Brown] and father [Hugh Brown], fortunate enough to have had a little experience with all of my grandparents.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you remember any stories they told about life in Mississippi or that you remember that they passed down?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah there were many stories.  I don't how to pick any one of them out because as a situation arises I can reflect on well this is the kind of thing that my mother and father told me about but just to pick one out of the sky.  If there's any that you can think of I can tell you and relate a story to it.  But.
Speaker 1: Is, is there a story about how they--why they left?  Is there a specific reason why they left?
Speaker 2: Well the reasons was that they were constantly the tax, the taxes, the taxes.  And you know the joining of black and white at that time was not accepted in Mississippi, no parts of Mississippi.  So gradually they were pricing my grandfather out of his land, taxing him out of the land in whatever way they could take it, they would.  And gradually they, they--and an incident came up with my uncle where he--you could not tell he was not white, he was not white.  He was the oldest brother of my mother and he was killed in Mississippi and that brought about a situation that was unbearable for the family to stay.  So my mother and father moved here but they didn't move here as a result of my mother's brother being killed, he was killed after he went back to Mississippi just to visit.  And old situations that had been stirred when upon his return resulted in a shootout and he was killed.
Speaker 1: Hmmm.  So.
Speaker 2: I can't, I can't go into the details only because I don't know all of them and particular I only hear the stories you know that were told to me.  You know when something about you know if, if you really wanted to we, we talk about it and we try to smile about it, a very serious subject but he shot the sheriff.  He killed the sheriff.  And he was hunted down and killed.  But it was not a criminal act.  It was something personal between the sheriff and he and a woman.  That's the only thing that--the only story that I got.  But he was not, he was not hunted as a criminal.  This was a personal fight that I think was between the sheriff and he and it resulted in both of their deaths.
Speaker 1: Hmmm.  So it's--
Speaker 2: So that's the kind of story that you might be looking for to see why they left.  It wasn't because of that it was because of the pressure that was put on my grandfather and eventually he moved here and lived with us.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean most people--I mean there's usually like something negative in Mississippi in those days that would make black folks move north, which many, many did.  You know I just--we always try to fish around for a specific story 'cause it makes it more real (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well if anybody were to use the story, it was because of the pressures that were put on my grandfather and that was something that was something that was an extension of the kinds of situations that he had to deal with.  But being a young man, a young fiery young man that you know was a strong character and strong minded and I guess that was the result of it.
Story_ID: 269925
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Reginald V. Brown, Jun-- Senior.  R-E-G-I-N-A-L-D, Vanderbilt, V-A-N-D-E-R-B-I-L-T, Brown.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Vanderbilt's an interesting middle name (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Very interesting.
Speaker 1: Do you know, do you know you know he got that?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I don't, I don't know how he got that but I know that in the, in the South years ago the names of English people were given to black people and they adopted by.  Many black people because they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I think of Vanderbilts a very rich New Yorkers you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --super rich.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah I think that, that emanated from England somewhere.  Much of many of our names came that way.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you think it was an attempt associating with wealth you know with Vanderbilt, you know what I mean?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  (Laughter)  No my dad was a hard working grass roots guy and he had nothing to do with his name.  I think maybe it was probably his father [Hugh Brown] or his mother [Ida Brown] but no.  He named his children you know he has, he has a junior.  There's a junior, my brother, my oldest brother Reginald [Brown] Jr., Leroy [Brown], [HistoryMaker] Charles [Brown] and Herbert [Brown].
Speaker 1: Okay is that all your brothers?
Speaker 2: Those are all four boys that my mother [Ruby McClure Brown] and father had.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Those are the brothers.
Speaker 1: And you're the--?
Speaker 2: I'm the third child.
Speaker 1: --third one okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now can, can you give us your father's date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Canton, Mississippi, 1905, I believe.
Story_ID: 269926
Speaker 1: Now what do you know about the ancestors on his [Brown's father, Reginald Brown] side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: To his mother and father.  That's about as far as I can go to his mother and father.  My--his mother was Ida Brown.  His father's name was Hugh Brown.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did, did you get chance to meet them and--?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I knew both of them.  You know the, the grandmother she never left Canton [Mississippi].  She came to visit a few times in Chicago [Illinois], but the grandfather eventually came to Chicago and actually worked in Chicago for a while with my father.  My father he came in and he worked as a steel worker.  He got many of his brothers and his father jobs out at the steel mill.  I guess where many of the black migrants choose, choose the North you know started work in the steel industry.  And my father he ended up--he, he died while he was a employee of Inland Steel [Company, Chicago, Illinois].  He worked there over twenty years--
Speaker 1: Hmmm.
Speaker 2: --and like I said many of his brothers did work there and his father for a while until he went back to Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Now do--are there any stories from that side of the family about, about life in Canton or, or why they moved to Chicago?
Speaker 2: No, I guess they were following big brother. 'Cause like I said he was more or less the, the not only the big brother like a father to all his brothers and sisters.  You know being the oldest of seven boys and seven girls and also being a very hard industrious kind of a person like he was, he was, he was a leader.  He was a leader of all his, his brothers and sisters and when they wanted to--something or they wanted to get some advice or some money or whatever else, they would come to Buddy.  That was one of--that was his nickname.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you say your mother [Ruby McClure Brown] had a chance to go to school.  She, she went to Madison [County] Training School [ph.] down there?
Speaker 2: Well my father didn't, he, he didn't get to high school I don't think.  He had a great deal of commonsense.  I think my mother just did go to--in those days you went to one school, one building, one room and then if you were fortunate enough you go to what they call training schools.  And she--her father sent her to Madison Country Training School [ph.] which taught all the ways of the life you know.  Things we call economics and also taking care of home, the home and also basics, living skills.  And that was what the training schools consisted of.  And she's proud of that education.  And it took her a long way and it provided the basis for my mother and father's law:  You will go to school.  That's no option.  All of her children will go to school.  And that's the reason for all of my, myself and all of my brothers you know.
Speaker 1: Now is there a story about how your parents met?  Did they ever tell you how they met?
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't think there's no way that they, they could describe it other than living in Canton it being such a small town there's no way they could not meet.  (Laughter)  So no, there was no real incident you know nothing under the cherry tree or nothing like that or just a matter of having so many people and I guess they picked each other.
Story_ID: 269927
Speaker 1: Well what's your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I wish I could tell you that, I, I can't, but, so many of them, so many good ones too.  My childhood was spent as I remember on, in, in, in the park, the park.  The park were a big memory because I think we can say we, we try to go back to our roots and basically I have gone back to my roots.  Because being the director of the Windy City Senior Basketball [League] which is over fifty basketball league, I find myself programming over 150 to 200 men in a basketball league that's operated in the same place where I enjoyed most of my childhood, within the same two or three block area.  And all of my good memories from my childhood emanate from that area.
Speaker 1: From Washington Park [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: From Washington Park.
Speaker 1: Chicago [Illinois].  Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm still there.
Speaker 1: Now describe this park for those who have never seen it, be those who have watched this tape but never seen Washington Park.
Speaker 2: Well Washington Park has gone through quite a change since my childhood.  Washington Park has, has spread out and many of the buildings that were there are changed.  But my biggest memory would be going and coming from Washington Park swimming pool.  I was born in 1936.  Washington Park swimming pool was constructed for the 1936 Olympic tryouts.  And if anyone remembers the 1936 [Summer] Olympics [Berlin, Germany], I'm sure not many do, but they had swimming stars like Buster Crabbe, Johnny Weissmuller.  These were all people that have gone on to be successful in movies and other areas.  But this is--
Speaker 1: And both of them played Tarzan.
Speaker 2: Both of them played Tarzan you know.  And Buster Crabbe I think he was, he was the guy in the space--the guy that was he--in outer space.  I, I think, I think (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah he was in a lot of things.  He was in Flash Gordon I think one time.
Speaker 2: Flash Gordon, that's, that's the guy.  He was--
Speaker 1: He became Lash LaRue, he was--
Speaker 2: Yeah he was Flash Gordon and that's the one I--that sticks out in my mind, Lash LaRue and Tarzan.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Well this is where they had the Olympic tryouts.  My mother [Ruby McClure Brown] and father [Reginald Brown] were avid swimmers and I guess it rubbed off on all of my brothers because they all got their scholarships from college for swimming and the experiences that we had not only there in the swimming pool but in the park itself because we lived two blocks away from the park.  It's like getting up in the morning, having breakfast and looking--and that's why I guess summertime is my favorite time of the year.  Because when school was out, you got up, you did your chores and you ran straight to the park.  And you might be there until its dark or sometimes afterwards.  Because the things we did in the park then are not allowed now because the park close at eleven.  As long as you didn't have a disturbance oh the neighborhood would--and the hot weather, you might have a band, you might have a--you're gonna have a ballgame in the day time.  Always had a softball Chicago-style 16-inch and nobody never heard that across the country, a 16-inch softball?  I took one to Seattle [Washington] with me when I went to college and everyone laughed, what is that, a mini, a mini soccer ball or what?  But anyway you know the story you've--if you're from Dayton [Ohio] you know they never had a 16-inch softball.
Story_ID: 269928
Speaker 1: Those kinds of memories they stay with you, they stay with you because those are good times.  You know nobody had to worry about anything, you know.  No robberies, you know, you could sleep in the park [Washington Park, Chicago, Illinois].  No one ever bothered you.  You didn't have to worry about someone doing anything wrong.  And then--
Speaker 2: Everybody says that.  They all say that, that's (unclear)--
Speaker 1: It, it was, it was, it was an experience that I guess is long gone, but it's just too bad because the park was a sanctuary for children, old people, anybody, anybody.  And, and it was--it just changed, it just changed.  The shrubbery that was down South Park [South Parkway] at that time is now King Drive [Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive] you had two rows of it and in the middle of it, we call it the Burma Road because anyone that ever traveled through that aisle that was through the shrubbery and the shrubbery was higher than any six foot man, so no one could see in there.  And let's say that you were being chased or you were chasing.  If you knew the road, you were all right because you could matriculate through there at a very high speed.  If you didn't know the road, you might get a face full or bush.  (Laughter)  And we would play games you know in and out of the Burma Road and if you didn't wanna travel the Burma Road, they had open fields.  They had a lagoon and which they still have the lagoon, but they had the boathouse.  And the boathouse had boats that you could rent and if you heard the story about Albert Einstein when he was at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] as a young person, you could see him out there with a pole and a line on it and no one knew there was no hook on it.  He was thinking.  And he wasn't gonna be disturbed because he was fishing so called.  They hear this story.  And so lovers, so potential lovers you know would go out and you rent a boat, and then if a young person you wanted to pick up a couple of quarters, you go work at the boathouse.  If you aspired to be a part of the [Chicago] Park District staff, you would practice and become lifeguard which all my brothers became at Washington Park.  If you wanted to just have fun, just go to the park, go to the park.  Because it was so hot no air conditioning you know.  You had ice boxes.  No refrigerators.  And so life was easy and if you wanted to fish, you fished.  And there was so many different things to do.
Speaker 2: So now just for the record, Washington Park we're talking about is a huge park.  It's not just like a city park of so many square blocks.  It's like a huge park that stretches through the South Side [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: It goes all the way from 61st Street [sic. 60th Street] to 51st Street, from King Drive to Cottage Grove [Avenue].  And then the Midway [Plaisance] which is a part of the University of Chicago extends itself all the way from Cottage Grove to Stony Island [Avenue] and the lake [Lake Michigan] immediately running into connecting with Jackson Park [Chicago, Illinois].
Story_ID: 269929
Speaker 1: What are some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: I gotta go back to Washington Park [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I gotta go back to Washington Park because all of the, the, the sounds in terms of what you would listen for to you wanna go to the park you find out well where is the noise coming from and what are they doing usually some kind of a ballgame.  If it was let's say the Bud Billikens Parade [sic. Bud Billiken Parade] or the picnic you know that you're gonna gather with your people because there's gonna be a basketball game out there on South Park [South Parkway; Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive].  You wanna be a part of that.  You gravitated toward your own activity and you know the, the fireworks and all of the things that went along with those kids of holidays you know, holidays were, were things you look forward to the movies you know.  Because the--you know there was only like one or two televisions in the block you know and it usually got crowded but there was that Saturday afternoon movie with ten cartoons and you know three features, two chapters.  People don't know what I'm referring to when I talk about chapters.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Chapters are series, series of a, a serial--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --which might take you know eleven or thirteen before they reach their conclusion.  They had a suspenseful ending every week.  So you had to go back the next week to make sure you found out what happened to the, to the good guy and whether the bad guy won.  Those are the things you look forward to in the movies, you know.  The feature films were usually a two or three cowboy or we call them shoot 'em ups and then the love stories, and then the war stories.  And then you had to look at the news on the newsreel, which was a part of the movie house.  So those are the things that jump out at me right away.
Story_ID: 269930
Speaker 1: We're at Betsy Ross [Elementary] School [Chicago, Illinois] now.
Speaker 2: Yeah Betsy Ross located on 60th [Street] and--60th to 61st [Street] and Wabash [Avenue].
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Neighboring schools were Saint Anselm [School, Chicago, Illinois] and Saint Edmund's [Episcopal School; Chicago International Charter School-Washington Park Campus, Chicago, Illinois].  So we had the catholic schools here and the public school you know right next door, across the street.  Natural rivalries but we're all part of the same community.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And you know in those times there were no, no gang rivalries just sibling rivalries and everyone knew everybody and still to this day we have our reunions from high school and grade school.
Speaker 1: Now where'd your family live (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well we lived at 58th [Street] and Prairie [Avenue], which in proximity to Betsy Ross, three, four blocks, everyone walked to school everyday, no busing then in those times.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well how did you like school?  Did you, did you really like school?  Or did you?
Speaker 2: School like I say wasn't an option.  It wasn't a like or a dislike.  It was a part of your everyday liking, everyday living.  It wasn't anything that you had to make a decision on as to whether you liked it or not.  It wasn't that kind of a deal like I said it was no option.  And so when you made a decision on whether you liked this teacher or that teacher or this--what is your best subject--you see my family was-everybody participated.  My mother's [Ruby McClure Brown] sister lived in the room down the hall from us.  My grandmother lived on the first floor.  Our Saturday and Saturday night and Friday night activities may have been a movie but then after dinner on Fridays I'd say the Chicago Tribune or whatever the Chicago [Illinois] paper was at that time, Chicago American, [Chicago] Daily News, it was the [Chicago Daily] Times and it was the [Chicago] Sun and I think the Sun and Times came together [Chicago Sun-Times] and they would have these little quizzes, test your facts and test your horse sense.  We would save them up for the week.  And everybody after dinner would get together and we'd ask the questions that came out of the paper and the winner the one that got the most answers would get some kind of makeshift prize that was created by all the people there mostly my mother, whomever.  My aunt was very influential in that.  Just to keep you sharp because the questions were worldwide.  Also they might have pertained to health.  They might have pertained to just the facts of living.  You know, "What do you do with mothballs?"  And no one realizes that you can use mothballs to deter squirrels from eating your tomatoes.  You know these odd kinds of things that--questions that you don't--nobody would even think of nowadays but I find myself saving all of these.  And so they stimulated you as a young person. I think that's kind of missing today because of television and we had to listen to the radio, which stimulated your sense of understanding. You had to listen.  And you didn't just listen to general topic you had to listen to what was not said when terms of people giving answers.  So you, you, I guess you were better educated let's put it that way.  'Cause the education wasn't just when you went to school because it was a continuum.  At home it started; the school continued your education.  My life skills were learned at home.  My book skills were learned at school and then, they were, they were joined together by the family.
Story_ID: 269931
Speaker 1: Now in the neighborhood you lived in, now in those days--I know a lot of--well black people went to one of two high schools in those days, right, either [Wendell] Phillips [High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] or DuSable [High School, Chicago, Illinois] for the most part?
Speaker 2: Well, basically my entire graduating class went to Englewood [High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: There were three of us that went to DuSable.  My brother, Herb [Herbert Brown] and I and I believe there was another fella oh yeah four.  Jerome Pias [ph.] and Jonathan Whitehurst [ph.] as I remember.  I know that Jonathan is no longer with us, he passed away.  But we lived across the alley from one another and we all went to DuSable.  Of course we all went to DuSable because my oldest brother [Reginald Brown, Jr.] went there.  He went there because of the swimming team.  You know and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --we were on the borderline because they had districts.  You went to the high school in your district.  And we were in more in the Englewood district than we were in the DuSable district and we were kind of out of the way too far west for Hyde Park.  And Hyde Park [High School; Hyde Park Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] was predominantly white, few black.  Parker High School [Paul Robeson High School, Chicago, Illinois] was also there on 69th Street and Stewart [Avenue] or Normal [Avenue] and that was a little bit of a stretch but DuSable was 49th [Street] and Wabash [Avenue].  Englewood was at 63rd [Street] and Englewood, Stewart.  But we were kind of on the border and it wasn't really strict--they weren't strict about what high school you attended during those times but most of the blacks went to DuSable, Dunbar [Vocational High School; Dunbar Vocational Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] or Phillips.  That's where the predominant population of blacks lived in Chicago [Illinois] and that was between 31st Street or 35th Street to 55th Street.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Cottage Grove [Avenue] to State [Street].
Speaker 1: Okay--
Story_ID: 269932
Speaker 1: What was your favorite subject in school?  In grade school [Betsy Ross Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois]?  Or did you have one?
Speaker 2: Oh I had, I had biology.  Biology.
Speaker 1: In grade school?
Speaker 2: In grade school.  In grade school, we learned about, we learned about the body.  Because many of the questions we had was about the body, but body and plants, plants.  My mother [Ruby McClure Brown] she's a--like I said comes from the father who's a farmer.  And we were farming, (laughter) even in the City of Chicago [Illinois] from the day I can't--since I can remember, we've always had a garden.  My mother's had a garden and still to this day she has a garden.  And she still does many of the same things, canning.  She puts her own tomato--makes her own tomato sauce.  As a matter of fact she's home doing it now.  And we do just so many of the same things.  All of the foods in the summertime, vegetables, they come from the garden.  So biology and I don't if they called it biology in, in grade school, but it was the study of the body you know and the plants and animals.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was basically my main interest at that time that I can remember because athletics are not really in my younger grade school years.  Athletics wasn't a part of it even though it was a kind of thing we all involved ourselves with, sports, but--
Speaker 1: So everybody played in the park but there was no organized activity of such huh?
Speaker 2: --not so, but we did ourselves.
Story_ID: 269933
Speaker 1: Now when did you first get involved in organized sports activity?  Did you get involved in grade school [Betsy Ross Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] at all?
Speaker 2: Well it was the softball because sports were not allowed in public schools other than softball, the 16-inch you know variation.  And you had to be on the patrol boys to, to even play softball.  So I became a patrol boy.
Speaker 1: Now I don't know if they even have these anymore--
Speaker 2: And you have must have been in the seventh grade, excuse me.
Speaker 1: --yeah.  That was a big deal in those days being a patrol boy.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: I don't think they have them in a lot of places now.
Speaker 2: Oh no, they have them in the city.
Speaker 1: But did you get--
Speaker 2: The city hires all the patrols--
Speaker 1: Do they still have?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah 'cause I know they have the ladies that the, the guards out there.
Speaker 2: They have the ladies and the patrol boys are supervised by the city provided patrol ladies.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But they still have some patrol boys and girls who are just there as a you know a representative of the school.  But the actual control of that corner or that cross way is conducted by an employee of the city.
Speaker 1: It used to in those days the boys would control the corner.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah we did.
Speaker 1: And you'd have a flag.  Did they have flags in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No they didn't have the flags then but you did and you didn't walk out in front of a car.  You held the students on the side until there were no cars coming then you allowed them to cross.  And like you said it was a big deal to be a patrol boy.  You had to be on the honor roll.  You also had to make sure that you were like perfect attendance.  There were quite a few stipulations in order to become a patrol boy and you had to maintain that status.  Because everyone else--it was competitive.  Someone else wants your job.  They want your position because maybe they want it for different reasons, but my reason, my rationale become a patrol boy I wanted to play softball.  (Laughter)  And the only ones that could play was patrol boys.  So I was able to stay on the honor roll but I was able to maintain my perfect attendance and do all of whatever was required, required you know to do that.  The other activities that I involved myself in was the school elections.  We learned about politics and when you got to the sixth grade you could run for the class president.  And even in the younger you know grades like that or you could run for different offices.  And so I got involved with making signs and campaigning and doing all those things that you know they do now in city hall.
Story_ID: 269934
Speaker 1: Now, was, was your family or did your family talk about politics in Chicago [Illinois] a lot?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  Yeah.  You know the alderman in those days was the big guy.  The alderman and the ward committeemen, my mother [Ruby McClure Brown] and her sisters, they worked on the polls.  You know they worked, they look forward every year to getting the--that, that five in the morning when you set up the polls and, and also they were affiliated with the alderman to find out just what was going on in the neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Now the alderman at that time was [William L.] Dawson, right?
Speaker 2: Dawson was in the--he was more or less located further north of us.  But Dawson was very big.  He was the black alderman you know in Chicago.  He and [Ralph] Metcalfe [Sr.], they were the big guys in the black community.
Speaker 1: So who was your alderman in those days?
Speaker 2: I can't remember because we had several in, in, in our area because we were just on the outskirts of Dawson's area.  Dawson was more like 47th Street to 35th Street.
Speaker 1: But you were a little, little further south yeah, and west (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was further south on 58th Street and our alderman he was affiliated with the--well they only had like I say Dawson he kind of commanded the black aldermen in Chicago even though our alderman was black, Dawson was kind of the figure head leader.  Because in those days the way Mayor [Richard J.] Daley had politics set up in Chicago, each, each godfather or boss of this area were the ones that would speak to him on what their needs were.  And that pie which was split was given out from city hall to that leader and then he would dispense you know whatever portions of that pie was to be given to the rest of the constituents.  That's the way Chicago politics worked then, that's the way Chicago politics works now.  But as I see it you know it was a--it's, it still says the city that works you know maybe it works a certain way but it still works.
Speaker 1: So now did grade school politics work the same way or (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Well no, not quite but I guess you had to adhere to the system that you were most familiar with and I guess maybe I did.  I don't realize, I don't, don't remember.  All I can say is that during the time that I was a young person, all we could do was what we saw.  And what we saw was a guy that was took the leadership in whatever activity it was.  Whether it was in sports, whether it was in organizing a picnic or whether it was in just being the smartest or the leader in the class.  You know when you found out who that person was, that's the person that you affiliated yourself with or you aspired to be.  Now I don't whether that's changed.
Speaker 1: Now did you get elected to offices when you were-- when you got involved in?
Speaker 2: I got, I got some offices.  I think for one term, one semester and they did the elections every, every semester because you have to remember when I was going to school the year was broken in half.  And even if through high school [DuSable High School, Chicago, Illinois] our years were broken in half into semesters.  I was playing on my high school basketball team and we had the team that was supposed to win the state championship but we lost two of our starters in mid-year graduation that we had to get two new players.  But that same system was--
Speaker 1: Oh so you can graduate in January?
Speaker 2: --in January, yeah.  That was when we lost two of our best players in January.  So that was what the system that we operated under when I was in grade school and in high school.
Story_ID: 269935
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers in grade school [Betsy Ross Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] or any, or any mentors in the neighborhood when you were growing up that you remember in particular?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  The teachers were the ones that provided the biggest impression on me and it's strange how at my age I guess we can remember most of our impressionable teachers.  You remember their names, you remember their subjects.  You know I remember Ms. Bowse [ph.], she was my English teacher at DuSable [High School, Chicago, Illinois].  I remember Ms. McCloud my geography teacher.  I remember Ms. Fortune [ph.] who was not even my teacher but she was the, I guess the secretary or clerk in the, in the school.   These are all DuSable teachers.  And I remember Ms. Tate [sic. Margaret Taylor].  Everyone won't remember Ms. Tate by that name, but they do remember [HistoryMaker] Dr. Margaret Burroughs.  She was my art teacher and she's now the founder of the DuSable Museum [of African American History, Chicago, Illinois].  Well, these teachers all had positive impressions on me as a young person because Ms. Perkins, Harriet, Harriet--Ms. [Mary] Herrick, Ms. Herrick, she's a great--I guess she was a historian and very, very well-known not only in Chicago [Illinois] but nationally.  But she was, had a great, great impression on me as a young person, before, during and after because I knew of her from my brothers before me.  And all through school she would encourage us and afterwards we would go by.  She was the kind of a person that you just don't forget.  All of these people.  Ms. Evelyn Carlson, she was the principal of DuSable and during the time that we were doing so well, of course you never forget your coach, Coach [Jim] Brown.  But then we, we still together.  So.
Speaker 1: How old is Coach Brown now?
Speaker 2: Coach Brown has got to be somewhere in his eighties, late eighties.  Let's see if I'm, if I'm sixty-eight let's see that makes Coach Brown 78, 80.  Yeah he's in his eighties, he's in his eighties.  I remember my grade school principal Ms. [Lois C.] Morstrom.  I still have my grade school scrapbook with her picture.  When she retired she said she was going to live in the San Fernando Valley [California].  And during that time in grade school we had newspapers.  I still have my grade school newspapers.  In high school we had the DuSable Dial newspaper.  I--you know you wanted to be on the newspaper staff.  You wanted to learn how to, how to write.  You wanted to learn how to get a story.  You wanted--and I became a photo advocate.  Everything had to be, I had to get a picture.  From the time that I was nine, ten years old I got my first camera with a subscription to the Chicago American and boxed camera and I've had cameras every since.  I never ever gone professionally but I was always an amateur photographer and found out that the best way to describe something is to take a picture and I've always tried to do that.  So the activities were innumerable.  You know you had unlimited interest.  You know anything you thought you wanted to do, which my mother [Ruby McClure Brown] and father [Reginald Brown] always told me.  You can do whatever you wanna do if you really wanna do it.  You put your mind to it and you work hard.  So the kinds of things that we did then in the areas of interest you just couldn't say one but if you found out that you were interested in something, do it.  My dad would say do the best.  Be the best.  Be the best at it whatever you do.  You know I heard it said many, many times since.  I heard Harold Washington you gonna be the best janitor, be the best janitor you know.  Best ball player, be the best.  And if you put that in your mind that you're gonna be no one can stop you but you.  You're the only that can hold yourself back because if you really want it, you're gonna find a way, you're gonna find a way because you can always find out why you can't do something.  But little bit harder when you're going to find a way.
Story_ID: 269936
Speaker 1: Now, at DuSable [High School, Chicago, Illinois] now you went there because your brothers were swimmers and swam there right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: You said that's one of the reasons why you went to DuSable?
Speaker 2: I went there because my brother went.  We followed my brother, same old philosophy that I just described.  Hey he's the leader, we follow him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So at DuSable now had you--now how old was DuSable at that time as a school?  Was it?
Speaker 2: Well DuSable was an extension of [Wendell] Phillips High School [Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].  Matter of fact it was called New Phillips [High School] the first two or three years and it did not get the name of DuSable until two or three years after its construction in let's see I can tell you the exact year but I didn't want to make a mistake on that.  It's--I can tell you that Nat King Cole was in the first graduating class and he did not go to DuSable all those four years.  It, it emanated from I guess the people that were sophomores at Phillips went over to DuSable and then in two years they graduated and that was like in, in the '30s [1930s].
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Forties [1940s].
Speaker 1: Okay now when did you start playing basketball?
Speaker 2: I started playing basketball the summer before I entered high school.  My oldest brother [Reginald Brown, Jr.]--
Speaker 1: So you were about thirteen I guess?
Speaker 2: --Yeah.  My oldest brother was responsible for me becoming interested in basketball because the YMCA Wabash Y [Wabash Avenue YMCA, Chicago, Illinois] historical building now which was the place where many basketball players were, were started in the black community the only place you could pay inside organized you know big--and so I would go down to the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] and I was called a spotter.  Spotter is the guy who sits at the table and identifies his members on his team and tells the score keeper who fouled and who scored the basket because we didn't have numbers on our t-shirts, if we had a t-shirt at all.  You were just identified a player and so doing that at the YMCA my brother was on the team that won their YMCA championship and then the YMCA would go out and we play in their district and then they go from the district to the region and then they go from region to the city to see who won or played the city championship.  And then you go throughout the Chicago [Illinois] area for the state.  Well they went to a pretty high level and I would travel with them doing the same thing on the road you might say with them as I did down at Wabash Y.  And timeouts, halftimes, between quarters, I started bouncing the ball, taking a few shots here and there and I gotta became interested and then that summertime I went at it out in the park [Washington Park, Chicago, Illinois].  And you had to learn to, to whatever you had to learn you had to learn real fast, had to learn how to play because the next year I was going in high school.  The first thing I wanted to do was go and play basketball.  Well I really was gonna go swim but when I found out what the coach's rule was, the swimming coach said Coach [Bill] Mackie said, "No.  If you are going to swim that's all you can do here."  You know the story.  I, I went upstairs in the gym and I tried out for the juniors.  During that time, the juniors were anyone 5'8" and under no matter what year you were.  Seniors was anyone five--over 5'8" no matter what year.  And fortunately I had an opportunity to play under both systems.  Juniors and senior systems as well as the fro/soph [freshmen/sophomore] varsity.  Fro-soph varsity is you, you know first and second year you play fro-soph after your third year, if you have not attained enough skill or gotten good enough to play with the varsity, then you can't play anymore because you can't play because you're a junior you can't play fro-soph ball.  And I grew a couple of inches after my sophomore year going into my junior year and I was on the varsity.
Story_ID: 269937
Speaker 1: So we got you making the varsity team at DuSable High School [Chicago, Illinois].  Now this is what year now about 1953?
Speaker 2: Well starting the '50 [1950], '53 [1953], '52 - '53 [1952-1953] season that was my junior year. And having grown a couple of inches, our high school then we had a coach by the name of Art Scher.  Now Art Scher was a white coach but Jim Brown came in as his assistant and Jim Brown came in as his assistant year before when I was a sophomore playing with the juniors.  Well we were supposed to have a pretty good team that year so Scher told Brown "I'm gonna take the juniors and they're gonna win the city and you take the seniors 'cause the seniors are not supposed to be that good."  It turned out that the seniors went to the quarterfinals in the city and the juniors went to playoff game and the section and lost.  That following year when I became a junior, Coach Scher transferred to Sullivan High School [Chicago, Illinois]. Coach Brown then became the head coach, basketball coach.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then that's when we went to--we won the Illinois Tech [Holiday Basketball Tournament] tournament.  We won the city championship 1953 and we went downstate and we were finally defeated by LaGrange [Lyons Township High School, LaGrange, Illinois] which went undefeated as the state champion in '53 [1953].  'Cause many forget about the fact that DuSable went downstate two years in a row.  What they remember is the controversial game and the state championship in 1954 against Mt. Vernon [Township] High School [Mount Vernon, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Right, now we're, we're, gonna get to that.  I don't wanna rush us to yeah okay, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm not gonna get into that but you see I had to learn how to play basketball very, very quickly.  You know going back to where we started in the story and not realizing you know that there all kinds of ploys and approaches and the philosophies to the game.  Again I subscribed to the way which I was brought up.  You followed your leader.  And if your leader made a mistake that means you made a mistake with him but my mother [Ruby McClure Brown] and father [Reginald Brown] also taught me that you follow someone until they lead you wrong and you're not gonna knowingly go somewhere with someone doing--if you know they're wrong.  You as a team member are supposed to help your team and if you know your team leader is doing something wrong, you go to the team leader and you help them.  Well to all of us young men at DuSable at that time, Coach Jim Brown was the leader.  And he did every--he could not do any wrong.  And he had a good philosophy.  His philosophy was conditioning.  And he felt as though if you were in better condition than the other guy, even if you didn't have as good a skills you would outlast him.  So he would practice us and practice us and practice us.  We would full court press.  We would fast break four games every day, four full games.  So when it came to the time when we would play our regular season game, one game, oh in the second half this is when the game started for us.  But then you watch your opponent with his hands on his knees, trying to suck up some oxygen, that's when you were recognizing that this is when you're going to take advantage.  So that philosophy held over and it proved to be very successful.  You know we lost two games in the [Chicago] Public League--one game in the public league in two years.  You don't count the games at the end of season against the [Chicago] Catholic League because that was the mayor's game.  We never did win one of those.
Story_ID: 269938
Speaker 1: We [DuSable High School basketball team] played against the [Chicago] Catholic League two years in a row down at Chicago Stadium [Chicago, Illinois].  Winners and losers got the same thing.  But in those days the Catholic League could not play against the [Chicago] Public League.  The Catholic League was not allowed to participate against in the state tournament.  And they had some good schools.  And they were able to play in the fifth grade.  Basketball, football anything they wanted to.  So it was some jealousies there you know but if you didn't go to Catholic schools you couldn't play.
Speaker 2: So they were more--
Speaker 1: And they could not play in the public system.
Speaker 2: --would it be fair to say that the Catholic schools had exposed the kids to organized basketball earlier and--
Speaker 1: Sad to say it's a fact.  It's a fact.  They were able to do the things that we could only dream about doing.  And they would travel.  St. Elizabeth High School [Chicago, Illinois] would go throughout the South every year and those guys would come back and tell us how they went to Tennessee and down in all through the southern belt playing against high schools throughout the South and all we could do was salivate and wished we were there.  And so.
Speaker 2: So what--was there as many basketball courts available in those as, as it is now?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Did you have like a basketball court in your--at Betsy Ross [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] when you were in grade school?
Speaker 1: No basketball courts.  Not at all.
Speaker 2: That's something that people would be kind of shocked to hear now.
Speaker 1: No, no basketball courts.  You, you had one court out at Carter High--Carter grade school [William W. Carter Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] outside on gravel and there was no paved courts like it is now.  We played in Washington Park [Chicago, Illinois] all tennis courts and they made one court a basketball court with chain nets and I guess they changed it--changed to the strings or I guess they took the nets off altogether.  One guy left his finger hanging up in the net when he had a ring on and so most of them didn't have nets.  We would get our own nets and take 'em down each day.  (Laughter)  You know because they wouldn't be there the next day.  But no there was not hardly that many, only in the playgrounds.
Story_ID: 269939
Speaker 1: I was just going to build up to this on the way up, did you have any basketball playing heroes when you were a kid?  Did you, were there any black players or any players--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: I mean at all that you looked up--
Speaker 2: Nathaniel, Nathaniel Sweet--
Speaker 1: --as a basketball--
Speaker 2: --Nathaniel "Sweetwater" Clifton, DuSable [High School, Chicago, Illinois] alumni.  And he was the first black player to play in the NBA [National Basketball Association].  I think they signed the same day as another guy who actually signed but I think Sweetwater was allowed to play first.  But you see Sweetwater is not only a basketball hero, Sweetwater was a softball icon in Chicago [Illinois].  I saw him and many people would see him on--at 71st and South Park [South Parkway; Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive] King Drive at Meyering [Park, Chicago, Illinois] playground.  You could not see the field or the people that were lined up around 72nd [Street] to 71st [Street] Calumet [Avenue] to 60th [Street] and King Drive when they played in the evenings out there because Sweetwater would come to bat and there's a fence all the way around from King Drive to Calumet, that's a block.  The outfielders would back up to the fence and I saw him hit a ball over the fence from King Drive to Calumet on a fly and hit the building.  And so whenever he went to bat, it was like Babe Ruth or Hank Aaron you know or, or right now Barry Bonds but you now this guy was a--he was known for softball before basketball.  But he also played with DuSable but won the Christmas tournament at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] long before the Illinois Tech [Holiday Basketball] Tournament which was the biggest tournament in Chicago for the Christmas season.  You know almost every school in Chicago would participate in the Tech tournament.  Well they did the same thing at the University of Chicago when Sweetwater in the '40s [1940s], '43 [1943] I believe it was that DuSable won it and he was playing.
Speaker 1: Okay so he was like ten years ahead of you?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  He was about just about ten years ahead of us and he was a, he was a, he was an idol, an idol and happy to have met him you know before and after.
Speaker 1: Now did, did you remember meeting any of the--I know there's a team at [Wendell] Phillips [High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].  I don't, I don't know I may be --Phillips with Charlie Gant and a man named [William] McQuitter?
Speaker 2: All of those guys Charlie Gant became a coach over at Englewood High School [Chicago, Illinois].  McQuitter they all, all these were guys that were like five to ten years ahead of us you know during that Sweetwater era and they all would come and affiliate themselves with whatever basketball tournaments and wherever basketball was you know you knew the name you may not known all about their history but you knew they were basketball players.  The same way that [Claude Henry K.] "Buddy" Young was at Phillips High School and he went on to play with the New York Yankees football team that people don't know anything about because that was a central football league [sic. All-America Football Conference] or something.  And all of these teams that were you know playing football like the Chicago Hornets and the Chicago Rockets [Chicago Hornets] and even the Los Angeles [Dons]--this is before the NFL [National Football League], but we would watch them at Soldier Field [Chicago, Illinois].  And when there was so few blacks participating in sports on a professional level, it was easy to identify and get a hero you know whether it-- whatever sport it was.  My all favorite spectator sport has always been football.  Even though I, I you know basketball was my, my life, but football was one which I wanted to--I just, I wanted to play football.  But I was always too narrow.  (Laughter)  And I could be broken in half so easily.  (Laughter)  Almost did a few times you know but I went out for football at DuSable--
Story_ID: 269940
Speaker 1: What did you want to play, I mean what position did you want to play?
Speaker 2: End, of course, to catch the ball.  And I was the one that was the slim target that every linebacker dreamed of cracking and breaking his ribs and his back and it almost happened and Coach [Jim] Brown told me, he was the coach, football coach also.  After, after catching one ball and you had to play offense and defense during those days and I tackled a guy who was about 220 pounds and I was about 135 and his stomach and his chest landed in my face or that cardboard helmet we had to wear then and the coach said, "Charlie [HistoryMaker Charles Brown] I think you better put your stuff up because basketball practice starts next week."  And I didn't argue one bit with him.  Not one bit.  "Oh thank you Coach, I'll be glad to do that."  So it was a, it was a no brainer you know.  It just, just a dream in my own head to play football but my body said no, you will not play football because I only became 170 pounds after I got into college.  I was like 100.  And the reason why I know my weight because I wanted to do everything.  I was in Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana] with Milt Campbell.  And Milt Campbell became the decathlon champion in the [1956 Summer] Olympics [Melbourne, Australia].  People don't remember that 'cause they remember the first--they thought the first black guy to win the Olympics championship (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Rafer Johnson.
Speaker 2: --Rafer Johnson, no Milt Campbell was before him.  Milt Campbell was before Bob Mathias.  And no--you know it, it wasn't publicized.  He didn't get the endorsements.
Speaker 1: No he didn't because I never--
Speaker 2: You never heard of Milt Campbell?  Milt Campbell was the decathlon--Olympic decathlon champion the first black in the United States.  And he was also the state championship wrestler in, in New Jersey.  He won the state championship and swimming on the same day that he won the wrestling championship.  He won the wrestling championship and then he ran over to the other side of town and he won the state championship in swimming.  And he did it on the same day and so Milt and I, even though we didn't live in the same dorm, he--we would wrestle and this was a strong guy 'cause he played football for Indiana University.  Well Paxton Lumpkin who was my roommate at the time signed me up for the intermural wrestling tournament at Indiana U.  And each dorm would have their champion and you wrestle with another--against another dorm.  Unbeknownst to me he signed me up.  Now going back to how I knew what my weight was, I was a 168 pounds so I to wrestle in that class.  Well, I didn't go to class for like two days 'cause you had wrestle five matches in one day.  And mistakenly the guy that was monitoring it did not check the fingernails of my opponents and I ended up with four scratches across my face and four across my, my body here and you know what sweat does to a open wound.  And I wasn't about to go to class but anyway long story short, I won the 168, 168 pound championship for my, for my dorm and that was the weight that I carried up until my junior year in college.  I began at 185 I guess after my sophomore year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I stayed that way.
Story_ID: 269941
Speaker 1: Let's just take you back to DuSable [High School, Chicago, Illinois] in 19--now when you--I was asking you about some, some of the heroes, sports heroes around town and stuff but when, when you started playing basketball, now you just, just started as an eighth grader, I mean what were the, what were the skills that you had to work on the hardest?  I mean what, what could you do you know at that time?  I mean what was your best skill in that?
Speaker 2: My best skill was shooting always.  And I was known for just a long shot.  I had one shot when I started.  It was a hook shot.  I took the ball and turned my back to the basket because I was too small to do anything else.  When I learned how to shoot the jump shot, it was just coming into being.  There was no jump shot, that was a one hand push and a jump shot it was something that was unheard of.  I think someone said that a guy by the name of Hank Luisetti was supposed to have originated the jump shot, that's arguably you know true but we don't know.  But I had a one handed push shot after learning how to hold the ball on the bottom with one hand and then pushing it away with the other.  That was my shot.  But then after realizing you can get your shot off a lot faster if you were on the run and you stopped and jumped and shot it.  And so I developed this shot along with many guys who were experimenting with it at the time.  A guy by the name of Ed Spears [ph.], he was a teammate of ours.  He's one of the three people that graduated in my junior year at half season.  That January graduation that was the year we were--we did win the city championship with three new members coming up from the, the bench.  But Ed Spears had what we considered the, the most perfect jump shot ever and he could hit it eight, nine, ten, eight out of ten easily.  Eddy was a--also a neighborhood of mine.  He lived in the next block and we're still friends.  But Eddy would shoot what we call the rocking chair jump shot.  He'd get up in the air and he'd sit down.  And he'd shoot the ball as if he was sitting in a chair.  And it was one of the most--it was the prettiest shot that you wanna see.  And he was a nervous kind of guy.  But when he jumped up in the air he looked like he just relaxed and it looked like he was looking at television, just shooting the ball.  Well he opened up the [Illinois] Tech [Holiday Basketball] Tournament with like four, five, six of these in my junior year.  He's still known and he still shoots that shot.  I think he's almost seventy years old but he can still shoot that shot.  It still looks good to me today as it did way back when.  And I have some footage a couple of years ago we played a, a rematch, a fundraising game against [Theodore] Roosevelt High School [Chicago, Illinois] over at Roosevelt.  And I got him on film shooting that shot.  I can use that same film and reflect it all the way back to 1953 and you couldn't tell the difference between the guy.  So that was my favorite shot was the jump shot--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and that was the shot that Coach [Jim] Brown said "Son if you don't have to drive to the basket, if you don't have to dribble the ball and you can make seven to eight out of ten from right here, why bother."  And his favorite saying was "Shoot the ball son, shoot the ball," that was it and maybe slap the hell out of you.  (Laughter)  And then you'd go and do what Jim Brown said.  You know, but that was his saying and even now many of the guys they get together and they look at each other and use that term, "Shoot the ball son," you know so you can see jump shot without a doubt, without a doubt.  That was a favorite shot.

Speaker 1: Now what position did you play?
Speaker 2: Well let me tell you, I have to go back to the beginning.  When we learned how to play basketball, everyone had a position sure on the program, you're a guard, forward or center.  There's no such thing as a power forward, point guard or two guard or stuff like that, none of that.  You were a guard, forward or center.  But what you did you analyzed your opponents' weaknesses and that's what you went to, their weakness.  I'm maybe six feet tall, 6'1".  If I had another opponent who was my size, I got real long arms and I could jump, our center he'd go after the forward or move on the other side I take my man down in the hole or the pivot and we'd keep plugging it and keep plugging it and keep plugging until a defense made an adjustment or a change.  Then once they made a change, we would change to exploit the weakness in another area of the defense.  That's the way we played ball.  So you learned how to play all positions.  You learned how to pivot, you learned how to hook, you learned how to drive, you learned how to defend in the hole, you learned how to defend the forward, you learned how to defend the guard.  That's the way we played basketball.  But to describe my position and my size, I was a forward even though no one my size would ever be described as a forward because I'm just barely 6'2".  I wasn't--I was always listed as 6'2", but never made it.  I never made 6'2" even the [U.S.] Army when I was maybe about 6'1" point, six one and a quarter, something like that.
Speaker 1: How tall were most of the players in those days?  I mean were they--I mean how, how tall was your son at DuSable [High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Shellie [McMillon] was barely 6'4", 6'5" barely.  And he was the tallest guy.  We had a guy by the name of Edsel Parks, we called him Tex.  Tex was about 6'5" maybe.  But that was tall in those days.  That was tall.  But those guys played seven feet.  They would jump and they would play and compete.  I never played against anybody a forward that wasn't my size.  I was always guarding or being guarded by guys 6'5" to 6'8", 6'9" and higher.  So I was accustomed to playing against guys much larger than myself all the time.  Then when I went to college, I was what you call a guard forward.
Speaker 1: Swing man?
Speaker 2: Yeah guard forward.  I would play guard if it was necessary or forward whatever was necessary.  I would go inside most of the time.  I was one of those rebounding guards because I would bring the ball down or I would most of the time I didn't even wanna bring it down.  I'd just get the ball across the halfcourt line.  Couple of dribbles, give it to the other guard or throw it up ahead.  That was my forte because I wanted to make sure if the ball was in my hands, the man that has the ball unless he's driving, unless he's hogging the ball, unless he's controlling the game, he's the last man that's gonna get the shot.  But if I threw the ball ahead of me and ran to get up, catch up with the play, I have just as much chance to get a shot as everybody else.  Most of the time I would get it because the man that passes the ball usually is the man that has the open shot.  It's like the man taking the ball out of bounds, no one hardly guards him.  He's the man that's gonna kill you if they look for him.  Because the man that is especially if they're pressing, if the defense is pressing, the man is out of bounds the man that's guarding him goes to double the ball when it comes in.  So take the ball out of bounds and run to the open spot and hope you get it back.  I was always the guy to take the ball out of bounds.  I wanted that shot.  And in those days guy would say how many points did you get?  And we were taught forget that because here is a guy we would call those the most selfish ball players.  I got my forty-three but they lost.  He's talking about his team.  They lost I got my forty-three but they lost.  And that's the kind of guy everybody wanted to get away--the guys who came up under the philosophy that we had.  And Coach [Jim] Brown would--he didn't care how many you scored.  You win the game first then you count your points.  Never be caught at the table counting up how many points you have.  That was a no-no.  I see guys doing it all the time but it's a no-no.  That's the selfish guy.  That's the guy you don't want on your T-E-A-M you know.  Because he's going to risk the win and the loss for his own selfishness.
Story_ID: 269943
Speaker 1: Who was on the team?  Who was on the team, the legendary team that went downstate when you played downstate?
Speaker 2: Well the first year we went down state, we had--I wasn't even starting.  I never started a game until my senior year in high school [DuSable High School, Chicago, Illinois].  It was Paxton Lumpkin, Bobby Jackson, Curly Johnson, Shellie McMillon, and Dennis Burns [ph.], [HistoryMaker Charles] Charlie Brown, Karl Dennis, Edsel Parks that's Tex, and I can't remember.  That's eight.  That's pretty good for the '53 [1953] team.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Now the '54 [1954] team was Paxton, Shellie, myself, Bobby Jackson and Curly.  That was the starting five up until the half season.  Then after the half season, there was Paxton, Shellie, myself, Karl Dennis and McKinley Cowesen.  McKinley Cowesen was a sophomore, a tremendous sophomore.  One of the best players at a young age as you ever--he became coach of a--he went to DePaul [University, Chicago, Illinois] and he became the coach at DuSable High School and he, you know he died of cancer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that was our starting five when we went down state in 1954.
Speaker 1: Now, now what kind of--were you all undefeated when you went downstate or had you lost a game?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-four [1954] we were undefeated, undefeated when we went down state.  We only lost that one game.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The year before we lost to I believe it was [Wendell] Phillips High School [Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] at DuSable.
Speaker 1: Who were the other team--some of the better teams in the, in the [Chicago] Public League then?
Speaker 2: Oh well you have to consider just before that '52 [1952], '51 [1951], '52 [1952] [Theodore] Roosevelt High School [Chicago, Illinois] won the city championship but they were not considered the best team.  They beat Tilden Tech [Tilden Technical High School; Edward Tilden Career Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].  Tilden Tech was leading them and a guy from Tilden with about thirty seconds to go went and took a shot that didn't even drawn iron.  And that's what I'm wondering what came over him?  Well Roosevelt got the ball and a guy by the name of Neal Miller, "Mookie" Miller who's on our senior--in our senior league [Windy City Senior Basketball League] now, he was fouled with about eight, nine seconds to go and they won by one point.  He made both free throws.  Well McKinley High School [Chicago, Illinois], no such thing as McKinley High School now I think the roof blew off during a tornado or something.  And all the kids went to Crane, Crane [Technical] High School [Richard T. Crane Medical Prep High School, Chicago, Illinois].  And if you remember any names in basketball, Leon Hillard who was one of the dribblers with the [Harlem] Globetrotters later on, he was playing with McKinley High School at that time, also Tilden Tech, tremendous, all boys, three thousand boys.  Two schools in the city public league were all boys.  Lane Tech [Albert Grannis Lane Technical High School; Lane Technical College Preparatory High School, Chicago, Illinois] and Tilden and each of them boasted more than three thousand.
Story_ID: 269944
Speaker 1: What was the season like that, that year?  Who were--we were talking about who the rivals were for DuSable [High School, Chicago, Illinois] in '54 [1954].
Speaker 2: In '54 [1954] that was the last year we, we knew that our rivals would be coming primarily in the--from Tilden Tech [Tilden Technical High School; Edward Tilden Career Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] which that time was all-boys on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: You said three thousand boys in the school.
Speaker 2: Over three thousand boys in one school.  The North Side all-boys school was Lane Tech [Albert Grannis Lane Technical High School; Lane Technical College Preparatory High School, Chicago, Illinois].  They were predominantly a football dynamo.  But Tilden was all sports, wrestling, basketball, football.  They dominated and they were right across the tracks from DuSable, DuSable being on 49th [Street] and Wabash [Avenue], Tilden Tech being on 47th [Street] and Union [Avenue].  So we were, we were rivals in more than one way because Tilden Tech had only two black guys playing with them, Bobbie Blackstone [Robert Ray Blackstone] and Tony Banks.  We were all friends throughout you know.  They were all the guys that we grew up with.  Well when we had our midyear graduation in our junior year, they came to DuSable and indicated, "Well you know what's happening with, Spears [ph.], Randall [ph.] and Grant [ph.] are gone.  Now you young punks are gonna get your comeuppance."  We beat them by forty and that was our first game after graduation.  Well you know when you sell wolf cookies sometimes you gonna have to eat 'em.  So it was a time for us to you know to you know sell a few.  Bobbie Blackstone was still there in his senior year.  Tony Banks went on to Wake--to Lake Forest [College, Lake Forest, Illinois].  And we went through the, the, the district that year pretty good.  [Wendell] Phillips [High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] was always a powerhouse.  Dunbar [Vocational High School; Dunbar Vocational Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] did not have a big Dunbar gym that they have today.  Dunbar was called a cracker box.  And the cracker box was a gym that you could get a rebound here, take one dribble and shoot a jump shot full court.  They had no stands.  They could only allow twenty people to thirty people in the gym when they looked at a game, very select audience.  (Laughter)  And it was a very small gym.  We scored over 100 points because it was a quick shot from one end to the other.  And those guys were considered a real, real strong opponent at the time.  Well John Leonard [ph.], DuPart Sanders [ph.], the guys that went to Dunbar were the same guys that we would play all summer.  Well now that's South Side strong--strongholds of basketball.  Englewood [High School, Chicago, Illinois] was always good.  They had Willie Jones went on to play with Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois] and many other colleges and, and the Detroit Pistons later.  I guess Shellie [McMillon] joined him in Detroit [Michigan] when he went into the pros after Bradley [University, Peoria, Illinois].
Speaker 1: This is Shellie McMillon?
Speaker 2: Shellie McMillon, yeah.
Story_ID: 269945
Speaker 1: We all went to college 'cause Jim Brown was good at seeing to it that we all got into college.  Paxton [Lumpkin] and I went to Indiana University in Bloomington [Indiana].  Curly [Johnson] and Shellie [McMillon] went to Bradley [University] down in Peoria [Illinois].  Bobby Jackson went to Northern [Illinois University] up in DeKalb [Illinois].  Karl Dennis also went to Northern.  I am not sure where all the rest of the guys go but I'm sure if I thought about it I could tell you each one.  But those are the ones that have come to mind that went to the major colleges because at that time blacks weren't attending major colleges at division one.  Division one didn't have blacks playing and even when we went to play, the unwritten rule across the country among all the division one coaches, you played one black, two max.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you don't play more than two unless you're losing.  And so was the case when Paxton and I was in Indiana, the other two blacks were Hallie Bryant who went on to play twenty-five years with the [Harlem] Globetrotters because he couldn't play in the NBA [National Basketball Association] and Wally Choice, Montclair, New Jersey.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: And I can remember being a part of a, a game against Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan] at that time Julius McCoy who was All American in football and basketball at Michigan State.  We were losing like seventeen points and Coach [Branch] McCracken put in all four black guys.  We caught up and I think we took a three point maybe two, three or four point lead.  And he jumped up on the floor in the middle of a fast break and called time out.  And there was mass substitution.  All the blacks came out.  And we won the game, but it was a very obvious move that we had worked our butts off to get to get to this--to take this lead back from a seventeen point deficit and then we all came out.  So the rule was adhered to.  And you know you can talk to some you know white coaches now today they, they talk about this unwritten rule among division one coaches.  And until the guy [Don Haskins] down at UTEP [Texas Western College of the University of Texas; The University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, Texas] who won the NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association] championship and he received a lot of pressure because they, they said that he had an all black team.  And Carl Nicks in the--from Englewood High School [Chicago, Illinois] was on that team.  No Carl Nicks I think he was with Larry Bird down in Indiana State [University, Terre Haute, Indiana], but there was someone else I think from Chicago [Illinois] on the UTEP team but anyway that was considered to be an all-black team which it wasn't not all-black, but it was primarily black.  And they were like the first ones to win the NCAA championship.  And he was criticized for using mostly black players.
Story_ID: 269946
Speaker 1: My experience in that in college was playing in a NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association] tournament in Kentucky when I was with Seattle University [Seattle, Washington].  Well we ended up playing Kentucky [University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky] who was coached by Adolph Rupp.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was known as the whitest team in the--
Speaker 1: Well he'd said--he made the statement that no blacks will ever play for him.  And then later on he said he couldn't win without 'em.  And this is, this is in, what is this SportsCentury I see it on television?  He, he came to that conclusion said I can't win without 'em.  So he, [Tom] Payne, I believe Payne was the first black guy to go down there.  I'm not sure who it was but--
Speaker 2: No first was a seven-foot guy that he brought down and he knew the guy had a lot of problems--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --the theory down in Lexington [Kentucky] that he brought this guy out because he knew he wasn't gona succeed--
Speaker 1: Un huh.
Speaker 2: --because he had character issues you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So this guy ended up messing up.  He said well see I told you, you know--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --they can't play.  You know.
Speaker 1: Un huh.
Speaker 2: They had other, other issues.  He can't coach him and all that kind of stuff.
Speaker 1: He want to illustrate issues other than basketball.  Well that time we were in the elevator Jeremiah Tax, I'll never forget his name.  He's a sports writer with Sports Illustrated had an altercation with Adolph Rupp.  Jeremiah Tax was Jewish and he had no problems in expressing his disdain for Jews as well as blacks and Rupp said something and well we got off the elevator, Rupp is fixing himself up picking himself up.  This was the same year and the same tournament that Seattle University played against Kentucky for the NCAA Championship and I didn't--wasn't even aware of all of this while I was playing.  I knew that there was an all-white team, but nothing unusual about that.  But we had just played the semifinals against Kansas State [University, Manhattan, Kansas] that had Bob Boozer on it.  And I don't remember them having any other black players other than Boozer but we beat Kansas State soundly.  Because we had a guy by the name of Elgin Baylor and I, I put Elgin Baylor up against anybody.  To me he was the best player that I ever played against or with.
Speaker 2: This was in Seattle when you were--
Speaker 1: Seattle University, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And when we went up against Kentucky, Elgin had three broken ribs in that game against Kansas State.  We weren't gonna tell anybody about Elgin's broken ribs but little was known to us the Kentucky doctor was the one that treated him and wrapped him up with tape.  And he went out on the court and the first thing the Kentucky did was ran straight at him and banged him right in the ribs.  Somebody knew something.  He got three fouls early, real early.  Okay that took away his inside defense.  And we played the weakest zone that you could ever see.  It was a--you know we were whipped because they had hit some shots, really nice shots but we lost our big gun.  He was not the fire power that he was and looking at the film which I got forty years later, 'cause that was the first game that was televised on the NCAA that year, I learned that later on.
Speaker 2: Now what year is this?
Speaker 1: 1960 [sic. 1958].
Speaker 2: Sixty [1960] okay.
Speaker 1: We played against Kentucky in, in Kentucky and it was a, it was a game where I think we lost maybe double, twelve points something like that.  But the game was never really dominated by anyone.  And even though Elgin had a very, very poor shooting percentage, it was unlike him.  You know the shots that he was missing and we, we knew why he was missing them because he was hurting and you shooting your jump shot or any kind of shot when your ribs hurt it's kind of hard and we knew he wouldn't show the pain, but he, he was showing it.  He was hurting, he was hurting.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Baylor went on to be one of the greatest basketball players of all time yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) To me he--to me and he was voted the top fifty greatest and he stands to me among the top ten.
Story_ID: 269947
Speaker 1: And you mentioned Bob Boozer.  I mean I remember watching Elgin Baylor in Cincinnati [Ohio] use Bob Boozer as a catapult to go to the basket.  He would grab--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --his shoulder and launch himself off.
Speaker 2: Yup.  Well we did the same thing to Bob Boozer when he came play with the [Chicago] Bulls.  Well it wasn't the Bulls it was the [Chicago] Zephyrs and the, and the Zephyrs and the--
Speaker 1: The Chicago Zephyrs.
Speaker 2: --and it was another name.  But it had two--
Speaker 1: [Chicago] Stags or something?
Speaker 2: --no, no anyway I can't think of it, [Chicago] Packers.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: The Packers and the Zephyrs and then they became the Bulls [sic.].  They were playing down at the, at the [International] Amphitheatre [Chicago, Illinois] and that's the new--you know that was the Packers.  The Zephyrs was when they were playing over on Wabash [Avenue] right here on Roosevelt [Road].  That was the--
Speaker 1: The [Chicago] Coliseum [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: The Coliseum.  They used to play in the--where the rodeos.  I used to go see the rodeos down there.  Well anyway Bob to, to us was like the [Walt] Bellamy.  You know Bellamy came to Chicago [Illinois] and played with Chicago [Packers].
Speaker 1: Right.  He played with the Zephyrs with Walt.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, you know what Wilt Chamberlain did to him.  His introduction was the first five shots he took.  You know he had a real good jump shot and the first five of 'em went back the other way.  And Wilt told him, he did a [Dikembe] Mutombo.  You know it was longest Mutombo ever, ever was mentioned or known about but Wilt did this uh-huh.  He, the first five shots that Bellamy took went back the other way and The [Big] Dipper [Wilt Chamberlain] was a--you know he was a great player but people didn't give him credit for the kind of defense not if Bill Russell was around.  'Cause you know Bill Russell was the greatest defender.  'Cause Bill Russell says, if you don't get the ball after you blocked the shot, the block, it wasn't any good.  And Bill was, he was the master.  He was the best.
Story_ID: 269948
Speaker 1: And all of these guys you see, these were guys that you were affiliated with because by blacks being so constricted it made for a closer knit.  I'm playing ball in the NIBL, National Industrial Basketball League, this is after Seattle [University, Seattle, Washington].  Denver Truckers, Wichita Vickers, Peoria Caterpillars and on you know these are teams that were AAU [Amateur Athletic Union] when the AAU dominated the basketball scene.  Well you go to the national tournament in Denver [Colorado] and it was one or two blacks on each team.  Well R.C. Owens [Raleigh Climon Owens] who you remember was the [San Francisco] 49ers.
Speaker 2: He was a wide receiver for the 49ers--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --it was an alley-oop play.  Yeah
Speaker 1: He and Y.A. Tittle created that.  People don't realize what R.C. Owens was one heck of a basketball player.  He was my roommate and we played with the Buchan Bakers out of Seattle [Washington] which was also a part of the NIBL and he could jump.  Well that's the reason for the alley-oop invention.  And we would go through a town like Wichita [Kansas] well, we went to a town and then we go to this big fancy hotel downtown.  We get a knock on the door and the guys says, he's a, he's a porter, he says, "You guys staying here?"  And we said, "Yeah, we, we're staying here."  He said, "No blacks ever stayed here before."  Now I got my antenna up and I mean what am I supposed to look for?  Oh he said, "Don't eat here."  Now you know I'm not gonna eat there right.  So we walked downtown hopefully to get a nice place.  Waitress walked by five or six, seven times.  People come in and they order.  Now R.C. from Santa Monica [California], I'm from Chicago [Illinois] and I know where it's at.  And he's gonna stop the waitress and tell her that he wants to make an order.  So the waitress gets paranoid and defensive, hey I just work here.  I can't wait on you.  I said, "R.C. let's go."  Now you got three or four guys big guys standing there at the door and being from Chicago I always make sure I got some form of protection.  You know I'm not gonna be out nowhere with nothing so, not a gun.  No 'cause we didn't deal with guns then.  But anyway R.C. wants to find out from the manager.  I said, "R.C. if they serve it, I'm not going to eat it so let's go."  We back out of the place like a wild west movie and fortunately for us by the time we go back to the hotel, there's Cleo Littleton only black on that team.  He knows what situation we are about to become a part of and he was trying to get down there to let us know, hey come to my place.  I got dinner ready for you, soul food, good food, meet his family.  So reciprocity when you go he comes to our place you know Seattle wasn't like that 'cause Seattle--I, I look at Seattle as a pretty liberal city country city.  And one of the reasons why I liked it and I stayed there for a while but when you go to Bartlesville, Oklahoma, Jamaco Saints was an AAU Team.  They went down there to play and in Bartlesville you got to come in at night and you got to leave before breakfast.  And they were not gonna let the white guy--I mean black guy stay with the white guy so Jack Mathis who was white coach and owner Johnathan Woenick [ph.] he, he canceled the next you know trips there.  And he eventually got out of that league.  Because I'm, I'm confusing two stories you know because NIBL was when I was with Buchan Bakers but when I came back to Chicago and my brothers were part of the Jamaco Saints, Herb [Herbert Brown], Reggie [Reginald Brown, Jr.] and myself, we never played together, just Reggie and I, and Reggie and Herb.  But no, all three of us never played together but you know Bartlesville was a part of that NIBL scene and some towns like that you, you, you did not, you did not stay with the white guys. That can be extended even to the time when Elgin Baylor was playing with the [Los Angeles] Lakers.  If you notice in the paper when he went down to New Orleans [Louisiana], he could not stay with the team.  And this was in the NBA [National Basketball Association] as late as '61 [1961] or '62 [1962].  Elgin said if he couldn't stay with his team, he wasn't gonna play with his team.  And he was boycotting the game.  Many of these issues came to the front when the media started publicizing them and many changes were taking place.
Story_ID: 269949
Speaker 1: During that time our country was going through a social change anyway, and having been a part of that social change in 1954, when we [DuSable High School, Chicago, Illinois] went downstate, we were able to experience much of this in Champaign, Illinois at the state tournament.  So Coach [Jim] Brown had kind of prepared us for much of this because he was one of the first coaches if not the first, to take our black team out to suburban schools and play against them and stay overnight.  Gave us the experience which prepared us for what some teams might have gone through in the form of shock when they go down state and get this big, big stadium because many guys had never played with more than three or four hundred people in their own high school.  And it also helped us in our later years when we went to college because when you performing before seven, eight, and ten thousand people you know, you don't notice 'em.  You don't notice 'em, you don't even hear them you know.  I, I, I, I look back--my brother Herb [Herbert Brown] who became a very, very good--one of the best most successful coaches in the Chicago Public League, Herb was on our basketball team as a reporter.  Herb could play.  He went on to play later on with [Chicago] Jamaco [Saints], but because of that rule in high school he never played in high school or college.
Speaker 2: 'Cause he, he was swimming too?
Speaker 1: He was swimming.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But I could hear his voice and he was like a coach in the stands whenever I do something, he would yell.  But I knew his voice.  I was tuned in.  I as turned in.  He was a breaking to the left or you know over play to the left, over play whatever instructions he would give, I could hear him just as clear as if we were laying in the bed next to one another.  And so I was able to block out all of what others would have as instructions and focus on what I was doing on the floor.  Focus on the instructions from the coach and then try to exploit the weaknesses of your defense.  So it was a, it was a kind of thing where I was, I was married to basketball really in a way and absorbing all of these things from a young age in terms of the pressures that society would give you.  Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana] 19--Indiana University versus University of Missouri [Columbia, Missouri] never will forget this one.  Nineteen fifty-five [1955] Columbia, Missouri, six, seven thousand people in the stands.  Very close game, last minute or so, Wally [Choice] and I underneath the basket rebounding, get the ball, throw it out, Hause [ph.], get the ball.  Throw it out Hause. We rebounding, our guys are shooting, white guys jumping on your back, referee don't call nothing.  And you jump on theirs, beep foul.  So Wally and I would really get beat up bad.  And Wally told me, "Charlie [HistoryMaker Charles Brown], don't jump."  I'm down at the court, I said wait a minute, looked at him all of a sudden, ball comes down, we get the rebound.  There's a guy from Missouri laying on the floor swosh everybody's gone to the other end.  You get a cry, "Kill them niggas," from six or seven thousand people, people don't know what fear is.  That's fear.  (Laughter)  That's fear.  You gotta get a police line.  We won the game by one.  Get a police line that gets you through to the locker room.  You can't go back to your hotel.  They pack your bags for you and send them to the airport where you got a charter plane and you got about two thousand people at the airport waiting for you.  And you gotta get a line to go to the plane to get on.  And I heard a comedian say and shouting these invectives at you and throwing stuff.  Ah man, now you talking about experience in terms of dealing with the pressures, basketball game ain't nothing, nothing 'cause you know you got a friendly opponent on the team, on the floor and he can't do anything because you got a monitor out there with a whistle.  But you got nobody monitoring that crowd and that mob that become a crowd--I mean that crowd it can become a mob.  And having gone through that, I thought well--this is before [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] now you know.  It's kinda scary but you mature fast, real fast.  And you learn how to handle yourself in the pressure situations.

Speaker 1: And I guess that's what kept me survive--I was a survivor on the street when I became a street worker or a detached worker with the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] in dealing with the gangs two or three o'clock in the morning and these sometimes are rival gangs.  I think that experience was transcending when you're meeting what is considered your guys' opponents.  Cobras, Vice Lords, Imperial Chaplains and they all come together and you there in the middle and you gonna mediate.  Who you for?  Who you against?  Because you gotta take a side as far as they're concerned.  And you gotta convince them 'cause you're on nobody's side, you're on all their sides.  Well lessons learned if you transcend then from one situation to another you will survive.  And I think that helped me to survive on the street being able to deal with all these situations that came up.  Some of them were a lot more personal.  I describe one was you know with a bunch of people but they are a lot more personal interactions, racial that you know you had to deal with which helped me later on to not deal with interracial things just to deal with your brothers and your sisters supposed to be.  Because you look at me, I had to deal with black and white.  I'm yellow, right. So what I'm looked at by some is if I were in Africa I'm a mulatto but I'm looked at the same way here in America.  And I had to deal with it based on walking that fine line to make sure you don't offend anybody also you don't want to hurt anybody but you also are not gonna be stepped on and you not gonna be hurt.  So looking at all these experiences that take you from "A" to "B" to "Z" if you survive and you get from one to the other, it's because you, you didn't step in something or didn't do anything wrong, but you don't have to anything wrong all the time.  You can do everything right and still get hurt.  And I learned that and I saw a lot of situations where that happened.
Story_ID: 269951
Speaker 1: We never did get on tape what happened at the game, the championship game in '54 [1954] but we've been a lot of other places which is all right (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well you know.
Speaker 1: But, but what, what happened--
Speaker 2: Well you can boil the game down to the last four minutes and seven seconds.
Speaker 1: You were playing Mt. Vernon [Township High School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Mt. Vernon was playing--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --against DuSable [High School, Chicago, Illinois] and DuSable was undefeated.  Mt. Vernon I think had won more state championships than anybody and Mt. Vernon at that time had one black on the team, Al Avant, and Chicago being the all--first all-black team.  Not only the first team from Chicago [Illinois] but the first all-black team to reach the championship game down state.  And I think Shellie [McMillon] had fouled out.  I think McKinley [Cowesen] had fouled out.  I think Karl [Dennis] had fouled out.  Well anyway it was a lot of us with four fouls.
Speaker 1: Three of the starters were wow (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah we were heavily, we, we were heavy on fouls even after half time.  And so Coach [Jim] Brown said the famous line, "Shoot the ball son."  He says I think the score was 67-67 with four minutes and something left in the game.  He says-- I took a shot, ball went in, beep whistle blew, no good.  I looked at the ref [referee] well we had just gotten a player written up the game before just by coming and asking the referee a question.  Brian Dennis went and asked him a question.  He didn't say anything or question a call, he just questioned the referee.  Well he did long write up on account of that.  Coach Brown he disciplined us very, very--he was very strict in terms of don't say anything to the referees let me do the talking and he's very strict on that.  Okay.  After the first traveling call, Coach Brown called time out.  "Charlie [HistoryMaker Charles Brown] I don't want you to fake.  I don't want you to dribble.  I don't want you to do anything.  Shoot the ball son, just shoot it.  Don't anything but just shoot it."  And I did.  And it went in.  And this is about 25, 30 feet from the basket.  After the ball went in beep, no good, traveling.  I said, "Coach, what can I do?"  He said, "Just shoot the ball."
Story_ID: 269952
Speaker 1: On the second call when the referee called traveling I said, "Coach [Jim Brown] I didn't travel, I didn't step, I didn't do nothing."  He said, "Shoot the ball son."  Next time down, they were just trying to get the ball to me and once they gave it to me no matter where I was I shot.  The ball went in again.  Same thing happened.  Then I just shrugged my shoulders and said, "Coach I don't know."  Well now coach was frustrated at that time I'm sure.  But--
Speaker 2: I think it was a three tremendous shots in a row.
Speaker 1: Three shots which would have put us up by six points.  There was no three point shots in that time.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: If it were three point shots that would have been nine points because none of my shots were within that arc.
Speaker 2: That's what we've heard.  I mean from people that described your shooting and you would turn around and shoot from--
Speaker 1: Didn't matter.
Speaker 2: --almost anywhere (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Didn't matter as long as I'm two or three steps over half court.  It did not matter.  I felt comfortable in the shot because as long as I could get the shot off, it didn't matter to me.  In other words they talk about me like the guy that shoots.  They say he's got no conscious.  I didn't think about it.  And if I thought about it I, I didn't have a chance to make it.  So I just went unconscious when it comes to precious situations I felt like hey the only time that you can win is when you score more points than your opponent.  And the only thing I can think of doing was shooting the ball and put it in the basket.  So after that I know I got a foul called in the last few seconds of the game and at that point in time I thought we had kind of lost it because with eleven seconds to go, Mt. Vernon [Township High School, Mt. Vernon, Illinois] was leading 72-70.  And guy by the name of [Don] Richards was on the line and he had two free throws of which he made both.  And here was a guy I believe he averaged like four points a game.  I remember Richards had glasses look about that thick and he was trying to look up and he couldn't see the scoreboard, but he scored 24 or 26 points against us.  And here's a guy that you never expected.  Now we knew Al Avant was their big gun and he was a good ball player.  Had a guy by the name of [Larry] Whitlock I believe but Avan was the one that we were trying to put up most attention to.  We didn't have very good defense.  We thought we did but our game was pressing and stealing the ball before they got it down to their end.  Once they got it down to their end it was just like any other team, they could score on us but we were never able to apply that kind of pressure because the foul trouble we were in.  We conceded that but we still felt like we could outscore them.  And I personally felt like we were gonna win.  But when the shots were called back and they were getting free throws and with eleven seconds to go this guy made two free throws.  That meant the score was 74 to 70 and with eleven seconds to go I think one of our guys was trying to rush the ball and threw it down.  It wouldn't have made any difference even if it'd gotten down to the other end and went in the basket we would have lost the game, but someone got fouled.  I think I fouled the last time.  Guy made two more free throws that mean the game was 76-70 but 76 the last six points by Mt. Vernon was scored on all free throws.  Maybe I know who the last four points were scored by free throws.  I can't remember because the tape does not show how the 72-70 score came about.  Because I looked at the tape and it says 67-67 with four minutes and ten or eleven seconds left.  The next time we see the tape that eleven seconds to go with Richards on the free throw line and the score is 72-70.
Speaker 2: Now this is a tape of the film that was shot of that game back in 1954?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: The Illinois High School Athletic Association [sic. Illinois High School Association, IHSA]?
Speaker 1: I have the original film and it still does not have it on there.  The film--the tape was taken from the film.
Story_ID: 269953
Speaker 1: Your baskets weren't good because you were called for traveling or something?
Speaker 2: Right, traveling three times in a row.
Speaker 1: And all you did was shoot it, you just shot, you didn't even jump (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, let's give them one travel, which I wouldn't because I was taught to shoot the ball.  Forget about the dribbling, the faking.  Just shoot it.  I wasn't a dribbler so I wasn't gonna about to try and drive around anybody so I just shot it.  Now the people that were at the game [1954 Illinois boys state basketball championship] and they were telling me how you guys were job and you got cheated.  I never used the word cheat.  Number one I'm an official, I'm a basketball official and maybe my motivation in becoming an official may have come from that experience.  And cheat is a strong word.  But the guy that refereed that game is John Fraser and it's funny how irony comes around.  He was banned from officiating for life three years later.  And he refereed in the tournament at Seattle University [Seattle, Washington] was participating in and that's where he got caught.  And I was red shirting with Seattle University at the time, Oklahoma City [Oklahoma] basketball tournament--Oklahoma City tournament.  And even though what he was--when he was caught fixing games I don't think it involved Seattle University's team a game that they played in but that was the tournament that he was caught fixing games.  Now here's a guy that was a proven pedophile.  Now you must as a basketball official sign a statement that you have never had a felony and you're not a pedophile.  You never been arrested for molesting children or crime of that nature.  And every year we must sign that statement.  Then that rule were not in effect.  He'd also been to prison and all of these things were documented later on and I believe the first thing I said was when I learned of it, I said, three years too late.  And not to say that he cheated because I never have said it.  I never will.  But I let the other people tell me.  That's what they tell me because being a part of it and being in it is like you know being in the forest you can't see it.  You can't see the trees.  But when other people tell me about that incident or that game they say oh man you guys you were taking the game away.  I, I, I say okay if you say so.  And that's how I leave it.  But I learned more in that one loss than in all the thirty-two games we [DuSable High School, Chicago, Illinois] had won that year.  Because you learn how to deal with adversity and life as it is not as someone's gonna paint a picture for you.  Because in life it's not gonna always give you peaches and cream.  And if you can't deal with the bad times, you in trouble because you gonna have some.  I don't know anybody that grow up through life and not have any bad times or the experiences that they couldn't control.  And sometimes you, you're not in control.  You gotta go with the flow.  You gotta be able to deal with it and roll with the punches.  And like I said those experiences transcended can be a prize to use in other circumstances in other situations that you again might not have any control over.  I try to teach the young people nobody said life was fair.  Nobody ever told you you were gonna get the best of everything but you better learn how to deal with it whatever it is.  Because that's the way it is.  And doesn't mean that you have to be a bad guy to get what you want.  And you don't have to be a gangster.  You don't have to be a drug dealer. You don't have to be a drug dealer to get what drug dealers what you think they have 'cause that's short lived.  Be the best at whatever you can be.  And hopefully you're gonna pick something that's gonna be positive and above all educate yourself.  Because if you educate yourself, then you don't have to follow somebody.  You can take the leadership.  You be the one to determine your destiny and you'll be able to determine what's right and wrong for you.
Story_ID: 269954
Speaker 1: Now you had a sort of a struggle in order to get an education.  You did something to your knee in high school [DuSable High School, Chicago, Illinois] right?  Was it in high school that you messed your knee up?
Speaker 2: I messed it up in college.
Speaker 1: In college.  Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: No, no, no I messed it up during, during the, during the summer when I was you know going to college [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana].
Speaker 1: Okay because you were saying that they, the doctor told you you probably wouldn't be able to play any basketball--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --but you needed to get your scholarship to be able to go to school right?
Speaker 2: Right.  Right and showed him.  He says you but you know I didn't even bother to get the operation on my knee until after college because you know I told you about my professional experience?  This is the time when they had many eastern pro [professional] league, they had a Midwestern pro league and a North America pro league.  And I played in the northwestern--north, North American and, and the Midwestern pro league.  And during that time you could make some good money on the weekends playing basketball.  But I can--I came back to Chicago [Illinois] I came back to work with the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] and I told you about this detached workers program where we went out into the areas of the city you know where the high crime and so forth.  But on the weekends I was playing basketball.  And this knee got to the point where I couldn't, I couldn't just do anything with it.  So I had to get an operation.  The guy that operated on me Ted Fox who operated on Willie Galimore's leg, Willie Galimore was Willie the Wisp.  Chicago Bears' halfback, one of the best in the NFL [National Football League]. I figured if he operated on his leg, that's the guy I wanna do mine.  This was before arthroscopic surgery.  So after he operated on me he says, you will not be able to play basketball any more, you will not--you'll have to learn--I had to learn how to walk without a limp because it was so much they had to take out of my knee.  There was no more cartilage and it was bone on bone, which it is now.  And he--when he told me I wasn't able to play I says, "I gotta, I gotta, I gotta play basketball.  You're not gonna tell me I can't play basketball."  Whatever I say you fix my knee, I'll do the rest.  You know I say that's between you know God and I.  God tell me whether so I went ahead and I told you I made All American what I did was I made all, all pro in the league and that's been the pro league that I played with and the knee I just stopped playing for two years afterwards.  That's when I told you I realize I had been hurting for ten years and didn't know it.  And I stopped.  I rehabbed my knee by swimming every day.  The leg got stronger then I went back to started playing basketball again professionally on the weekends, working with the kids at the YMCA during the week.  Then using that basketball as a programming tool 'cause we were--I had station wagons.  All the guys that worked at the Y had station wagons.  I'd pile my station wagon up with 12, 13, 14 kids and when I play the game they went to the game.  I'd wear my [Chicago] Jamaco [Saints] coat, jacket when I was playing with Jamaco.  I'd take 'em to the Chicago Stadium [Chicago, Illinois], we'd go into the stadium.  Hey I'm programming these kids.  Got the cooperation from the people from the stadium.  They let them in and I went to everything.  Stock car races.  But I am now rehabbing my leg during this time in this interim period and then like I said I went to work in the week after a year or so I went back and started playing ball and I had made my leg stronger.  So strong that I could really, really play hard and even though I knew the knee was you know not like it was, but I could maneuver and I could, I could let's say I could perform adequately.  But I don't--I say to anybody that have a knee operation will never be the same, never.  I looked at some of the greatest Elgin Baylor after his knee operation, he was voted to come back player of the year.  But he was still never the same, never the same.  No matter who it is.  Think of anybody who had a knee operation in sports.
Speaker 1: Well it's true, yeah.
Speaker 2: Never the same.
Speaker 1: That's the one weak link in every sport I guess is that knee.
Speaker 2: The knees, the knees.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Football, basketball, tennis you know any track player we can forget that.  You know I wanted to be a high jumper, but no, no way.  No kind of way.
Story_ID: 269955
Speaker 1: When did you last play professional basketball?
Speaker 2: That was with the Holland Oilers up in Holland, Michigan and that was in that North American pro league [sic. Midwest Professional Basketball League], which eventually became part of the ABA [American Basketball Association].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is like around 1970 I guess, 1968, '69 [1969], '70 [1970]?
Speaker 2: I would say in the '70s [1970s], in the '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Three point shot came out in 1972.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I believe in college and the ABA had used it before 'cause they were using a colored ball, multicolored ball.  Yeah, about 19--not like that it was even later than that because I was still playing I never did stop playing like now.  I played up until the last two years.  I still play senior ball but not on that competitive level that they're playing with me in the pros.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now you worked in the--with the, the gang inter---well you say gang intervention is a reduction of it but it's a--
Speaker 2: The YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association].
Speaker 1: --YMCA yeah.
Speaker 2: YMCA detached workers program is a former title and I worked as first a street worker then I was a supervisor of the workers in the area when the program grew into then the jobs program which is nationwide.  You know then the government was funding these programs directly.  Then the city's manpower organization began to take the money that was funneled to the cities and distributed among these serving organizations like ours and then I became the, I went into a training program with the--one of the food store chain here in Chicago [Illinois] and matriculated through the middle management and then became the community relations manager, then after that going out working as a private business man myself.  And then, and then after that, semiretired really.  And going into senior basketball I, I fully retired from what you say, working as conventional people do and devoted most of my time to senior basketball.
Story_ID: 269956
Speaker 1: Have you ever been engaged in scouting or anything like that for teams?
Speaker 2: I was with the Boy Scouts [of America].
Speaker 1: No, no I mean scouting the (laughter)--
Speaker 2: You got it, that's a different kind of scouting.  Okay I know what you talking about.  No, what I've done is, I've try to help young people to get into schools and that's an ongoing effort of mine and it's not affiliated with any school.  It's not affiliated with any sports program, it's not affiliated with any professional organization.  It's something that I've done because I think I'm attached to the young people of Chicago [Illinois] for since high school [DuSable High School, Chicago, Illinois] because my roots go all the way back to people that I went to school with, their children, their grandchildren and now some of their great-grandchildren.  I remember refereeing, which I still do and I put most of my attention to the middle schools now because I figure that's the key age.  If you get a child before fourteen years old, thirteen, fourteen is the age where they start to change and determine what's gonna happen, what they're gonna be.  And if you get them before that and you can institute some positive changes within that individual, you have a chance to mold the character and you have a chance to determine or help determine what the outcome is gonna be when they become an adult.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That's my experience and I find if to be true over and over, year after year after year.
Speaker 1: Now we live in an age now where awards for sports are much greater than they ever were before--
Speaker 2: You tell it.
Speaker 1: --on a certain level.
Speaker 2: Man.  You telling me.
Speaker 1: But you gotta get to that level before you get those rewards and you know there's so many people that are close to being on that level are or, or can play on that level but just don't have--can't crack that top group you know to get the money.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Is it tougher now for young people than it ever has been do you think in terms of being involved in sports and being successful at it?
Speaker 2: I'd say yes only because of the numbers.  That's what makes it tough.  It's tougher because you got more people trying to reach that pinnacle even though the base is a lot broader you have more teams, more professional sports, more activities that they can aspire to be at the top of but you got more people--
Story_ID: 269957
Speaker 1: --Way more people, it's the reason I started the senior basketball league [Windy City Senior Basketball League] in high school [DuSable High School, Chicago, Illinois].  It was George Orwell's '1984' you remember that book?  Do you remember somewhere in there it said about in the '80s [1980s] that the population of the United States was gonna be more over fifty than under fifty because the Baby Boomers were gonna flop?  Well I'm just a little bit ahead of the Baby Boomers and so I'm realizing what am I gonna do when I get to be over fifty.  'Cause first thing when we were growing up we didn't even believe we were gonna live past fifty.  We thought fifty was it.  Hey fifty, who's gonna be fifty the heck with that.  You know ain't nobody planning past fifty but then after I got older, thought about it and I said well I know I'm gonna be doing something and I found out after going through the corporate experience and, and independent operations and so forth so what will I be able to do?  And what do I like?  Well first thing I said is what I like.  I liked basketball.  Well how you gonna do that?  Guy called me up and said hey, you played against us in high school and you beat us and it happen to be a fella by the name of Michael Artman [ph.] and he was like at that time president of Chicago Public Schools Alumni Association an organization created by he and some others to help to support the public school achievers you know independent of the public school itself.  And he was the guy that I had scored the record number of baskets against in the [Illinois] Tech [Holiday Basketball Tournament] tournament, Christmas tournament.
Speaker 2: What was the record though?
Speaker 1: Seventeen baskets.  No free throws.  And his teammate also had scored seventeen baskets the year before so his teammate and I share a record that'll never be broken 'cause there's no such tournament any more.  And his teammate is also part of our senior league and so "Moose" Malitz, Jerry Malitz that was the guy that I shared a record with.  We had this rematch.  He called me up and says he wanna rematch.  This is thirty-five years later.  And I said okay.  So we decided we were gonna raise funds and give them to each of our schools and this rematch took place in 1987 over at Whitney [M.] Young [Magnet] High School [Chicago, Illinois] where we had all of the original cheerleaders from both schools.   The only person that was missing was Edelcup [ph.].  That was their coach 'cause he was--he had gone--he had passed but our coach Jim Brown was there and the criteria was everybody had to be fifty and if you were in '54 [1954], 18, 19, this is 1987 everybody was fifty right?  So we had like ten coaches on each side.  A lot of guys weren't playing any more.  About fifteen players and we filled up Whitney Young High School's gym.  We were able to give each of our schools you know a couple $1,000 for their athletic department and this fella and I said, boy this is fun.  We're gonna do this again.  And we did.  Only we did it one time over at [Theodore] Roosevelt [High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Story_ID: 269958
Speaker 1: They had a tournament down in Florida, Fort Lauderdale [Florida].  It was called the men's masters [Masters Championships].  At that time it was sponsored by the AAU [Amateur Athletic Union].  The City of Coral Springs [Florida] in Ft. Lauderdale since taken over and they independently operate the whole thing, biggest tournament in the country along with one up in Buffalo, New York.  Well they were going down at this tournament, first tournament, and they called and said hey you wanna get on our team and go down there.  I said yeah sure.  You had to be fifty.  Two weeks before the tournament something came up I couldn't go.  Well they went down there and they told me what the experiences were.  He says well the other team had seventeen points before we scored a basket.  I said oh maybe I'm glad I didn't go.  But after that the next year I went with them and that's when we started to build our own team.  Then we would go and play in these thirty-five and older tournaments, played out in Skokie [Illinois], other suburbs and so forth 'cause we couldn't find people over fifty so we had to play in the thirty-five and forty year old tournaments.  And then I said why don't we get our own league over fifty?  And Mickey [ph.] said, "Charlie [HistoryMaker Charles Brown] you crazy you know we not--how can we get over that many guys over fifty."  I says, well I tell you what, it's eight of us.  If each one of you become a captain, you remember how we used to do it on the playground and it doesn't matter what city you're in whether you're in Dayton [Ohio], Chicago [Illinois], New York [New York], Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] or whatever, you get on the playground and everybody pick their men.  I said well you gotta team, you gotta a team.  I says we're gonna start out with eight teams and each one of you are gonna be a captain and neither one of you can play on the same team.  And they said well, where are we gonna get the players?  I said I'll get the players.  I said but each one of you have to do one thing.  'Cause we was gonna have--it we're gonna have an organization everybody can't be doing the same thing.  And he said well whose gonna--I said I'll run it.  I said I'll be the director.  He says now okay they said now this is going on for a few months and I'm still being called the little crazy man because I got this stupid idea that we can have a senior basketball league with fifty and over.  Well the rules were not all generated at the same time.  But as we begin to get closer and closer to the actual beginning of this league I had formulated some rules.  And having been a phys ed [physical education] major and also I have an organized work with the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] and program you know thousands of kids, I had some experiences in putting programs together.  Well, I signed each one to certain tasks making Hughes [ph.] the communication center.  He has a law firm down on 180 North LaSalle [Street].  All communications and so forth will come through you.  We get ready to get in touch.  Doc Hughes you'll be the business manager you know.  He's had some connections with Wilson [Sporting Goods Company] and some other sporting aids.  Another guy was gonna be the treasurer.  Whatever monies we generate we need money for tournaments or whatever you can control that and solicitations and all of that.  And then we had some very good sponsors.  Freddie Rosen [Fred Rosen] who owned Sam's Liquors [Sam's Wines & Spirits, Chicago, Illinois] supposed to be the largest liquor store in the world, he was one of our sponsors as well as a player.  He played.  But then we had Rich Melman who owned Lettuce Entertain You [Enterprises, Chicago, Illinois] and he was our original sponsor.  As a matter of fact our team was a Lettuce Entertain You basketball team and that is what we had the name of our league was the Lettuce Entertain You Basketball League [Windy City Senior Basketball League].

Speaker 1: We were talking about the Lettuce Entertain You basketball team, that was the first version of, of the?
Speaker 2: That was the first version of the Chicago [Illinois] fifty and over basketball team.  And it was the beginning of the Windy City Senior Basketball League because originally we were known as the Lettuce Entertain You Basketball League and Lettuce Entertain You basketball team.  That team is the one that represented Chicago in tournaments throughout the country and many tournaments throughout the world.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So when we began the league the guys wondered where are the players coming from?  Well I'm the busy little spy who would ask everyone we played against how old they were.  And if they were forty-eight and up I'd take name, address and phone number.  I got all the data.  So I figured in a year I'd be able to let anyone forty-nine, because as long as you were gonna become fifty within the calendar year, you're eligible to play in all of the tournaments international and national tournaments.  So I used the same rule for the league.  And actually by the time I got the league started, most of the people were over--were fifty any way because it took a year or more--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --to get it started.  From the eighteen to the now what is twelve teams or ten men on every team and each team goes over the ten man limit attrition level in our age you know various reasons, getting hurt, changing jobs and family situation, structure might change.  Well anyway we formed this league and we started playing 1995.  But in 1990 actually '91 [1991], '92 [1992] I said well the way that we can give this a real test 'cause we been going to all these tournaments all over the country I said let's have our own tournament.
Speaker 1: Oh you mean the 2001, 2002?
Speaker 2: No 1990.  Nineteen ninety [1990], '91 [1991].
Speaker 1: Okay so the league started in--
Speaker 2: Ninety-five [1995].
Speaker 1: Ninety-five [1995].
Speaker 2: The tournament started before the league.
Speaker 1: Oh early, oh okay.
Speaker 2: That was the test.  The tournament was the test because we been traveling to all these other tournaments from '87 [1987] on, three, four years.  And I said why don't we have our own tournament in Chicago?  We got all the venues in the world.  Chicago is a big place.  So all the tournaments we went to I would give them the fliers for the third weekend in August in Chicago and it will be called the Windy City Invitational.  That was the first one.  Thereafter it became the Windy City Shootout.  And I said to all the guys this will be our ID.  The third weekend in August Windy City Shootout then we started with Windy City Shootout I.  And I went to Rich Melman and I said we'd like to have a national tournament and I want your help.  He gave us the biggest jumpstart you ever wanted to see.  At that time he owned The Pump Room [Chicago, Illinois] and much of The Ambassador East [Public Chicago Hotel, Chicago, Illinois].  He gave us a party inviting all of the participants from Chicago and all the cities.  We had Toronto [Canada] and I think it was only about four, five or six teams.  But he had a tremendous party there.  And maybe they drank, some food, Doc Hughes [ph.] had gotten sweatshirts from Wilson Sports [Wilson Sporting Goods Company].  We've gotten balls from Wilson Sports also.  Key chains from Wilson and all the other kinds of paraphernalia that added to the--they just enhanced our entire operation that's all.  It was--and everyone throughout the country got the word right away.  Go to Chicago's invitational.  It is the very best.  From then on we have continuously mushroomed.  The tournament has grown and grown and grown where we have four divisions, now we have five.  Fifty and over, fifty-five and older, sixty and older, sixty-five and older and we have an exhibition game with all seventies.  And the cities are represented from coast to coast.
Story_ID: 269960
Speaker 1: Y'all been doing this for almost fifteen years I guess now (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well we just completed Windy City Shootout Roman numeral XIII.  We just completed last year in June of this year our tenth season in the league [Windy City Senior Basketball League].  But you see we were in existence like three, four years before that.  We were organized but, but we weren't formerly structured with names.  All we were was the Lettuce Entertain You basketball team.  We didn't have a league and we didn't have a tournament.  But now we are Windy City all the way.  And Rich Melman he's still sponsoring us.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what venues do you all use, mostly [Chicago] Park District venues?
Speaker 2: Park district, Chicago Park District.  We have used Solheim Center [Moody Bible Institute, Chicago, Illinois] in the past.  We've used a set of other centers, but home base is Washington Park [Chicago, Illinois], Ogden Park [Chicago, Illinois], Avalon Park [Illinois], Nichols Park [Illinois], park districts on the South Side.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I say Washington Park and I keep centering on that because I'm back to my roots you know.  And they say how do you get all of these people to come to the South Side of Chicago [Illinois] and I say we're the ball.  I say we go back to our roots in one way or another.  And whatever attracts you when you were a young person if you enjoyed it I look at it as the same way that I--I, enjoyed it.  So if they still enjoy it and they can still do it, 'cause that's the difference between us and the guy sitting up and looking at television, they're talking about what they used to do and what they did we're talking about what we're doing.  We're not sitting up in a rocking chair holding our grandson, our great-grandson telling them about what grandpa used to do as he watches television and as he watches the [Chicago] Bears or the [Green Bay] Packers or the [Chicago] Bulls or the [Chicago] White Sox or the [Chicago] Cubs.  He's telling his kids about what he's doing now and his kids are going to the game with him saying look at what grandpa is doing?  So that's the difference between us.  And when we talk about the experiences that we have had, we can take our families to Florida.  We can take our families to Toronto [Canada].  We can take them to New York at the Buffalo Masters [Basketball].  You know these are the kinds of things that separate us now from the guys that used to do it.  I'm talking about what they used to.
Speaker 1: Yeah some of this--it's interesting culture around the basketball old guys playing basketball.  I, I still try to play myself but we got a set Tree [ph.] has over Kennedy-King [College, Chicago, Illinois] we gathers mostly older people together to play and then there's Bob Hambric and Pitman [ph.] they play and Scottie [ph.].  Some people used to be great ball players like Hambric or, or Cliff Washington [ph.] or somebody but then there's some that never really played until they got grown.
Speaker 2: Well you know--
Speaker 1: Still aren't playing.
Speaker 2: --it was very strange in our league.  We look at that as a fact that none of us have possessed the same skill levels in sports but the funny thing about it is that guy that's continued to, continued to keep himself physically fit and kept doing it.  He may have been that last man on the bench but the all-star who was the big name and the big letter man who did not do it or can't do it any more, he cannot perform as well as this guy that was on the bench that kept on doing it.  We have a rule in our league.  Every player on the bench must play a minimum of five minutes per half.  Now the game is forty minutes right.  That meant he's gonna get his ten minutes.  We all have to pay a entry fee therefore if he pays the same amount as you did he should get some compensatory time for his entry fee and that does not mean that during the tight games he can't play.  Because if you don't want him in at crunch time, captain or coach, give him his minutes early.  But he deserves his minutes.  Makes for a very competitive league and it also provides the league with some equity in terms of no one runs away with the league.  No one team runs away with it.
Story_ID: 269961
Speaker 1: It behooves them to have good reserves huh? Or good guys on the bench?
Speaker 2: Well we balance the teams out when we put them together.  We have a draft.  There's not a real draft like the NBA [National Basketball Association].  We have so many sixties so many fifties, 55s and we go we compose a team based on skill level.  If I have two "A's," "A" ball players "A" being the best, "A," "B," "C" then I must have two "Bs," I must have two "Cs" or three "A's," three "Bs," three.  We only wanna have two "A's" on any one team.  Like a ball player like a Mickey Johnson formerly with Chicago Bulls and the [Milwaukee] Bucks.   And he's still playing very, very competitively.
Speaker 1: Yeah he was a--
Speaker 2: So you know we don't wanna put another Mickey Johnson on the team with him.  So we spread it out.  We put a Lloyd Batts on the other team.  So that that offsets that Mickey Johnson then we put another guy who's a Harvey Catchems [ph.] on another team form--another NBA player and no three "A" players are gonna be on the same team.  We also put that guy like I just described that was only on the end of the bench, we put him on that team with that "A" player and then we got some guys who couldn't hardly make the real team who just wanna play.  Then we make sure that no two or three of those guys are on the same team either.  So I have to take all the weight for that and when everybody's angry with me I know I did a good job.  We want him, we want this guy, we want.  Hey and they say well why can't we have him.  I recruited him.  I brought him into the league [Windy City Senior Basketball League].  I said yeah but you can't make the assignments.  We drafted him.  I say yeah you did, but the other guy he had a big offer.  Ain't no offers, nobody does anything.  I do it and I have to take the weight for it.  So every team in our league is balanced to as much degree as we can.
Story_ID: 269962
Speaker 1: I have to ask you this, this is extraneous to what I would usually ask.  But the U.S. Olympic team just lost for the first time in international competition lost, lost the [2004 Summer] Olympics [Athens, Greece], well it wasn't a controversy because I know the Russian team won the '72 [1972] but there was a--they kept putting the clock back and it was a--
Speaker 2: Yeah well we know the story about the Russian team.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And then--that wasn't, that wasn't the same situation that we have today.
Speaker 1: Yeah today though we sent--
Speaker 2: Today they lost.
Speaker 1: --young stars out there, supposedly under one of the better coaches in NBA [National Basketball Association], Larry Brown, and they lost.  They got defeated by Argentina and Lithuania, you know what happened?  Do, do you have announcer's name do you wanna spend time talking you know.
Speaker 2: Well it's easy to analyze that especially you call that a before and after.  Before team play and after team play.  This is after (laughter).
Speaker 1: So they, they weren't playing team ball you say?
Speaker 2: Hey they never gonna learn to play team ball, nobody learned, nobody plays team ball.  What is incentive in the NBA now?
Speaker 1: Money yeah.
Speaker 2: The money.  How many ball players that make the big bucks went to the Olympics?  We didn't have your best representatives there.  Do you remember when no pros were allowed to participate in the Olympics?  We had true teams.  Nobody wanted to do anything but win.  And you can't turn off that mentality just because you go overseas.  After what they have learned from the time that they were able to step on the court, my son's gonna be a millionaire because he can play ball.  Therefore, the mentality is you must perform individually as much as you can.  It's not a, it's not a knock against any individual ball player, it's a knock against the whole system.  Our system does not denote team.  Team after me.  I first, then team.
Story_ID: 269963
Speaker 1: On that note, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Young men primarily.  Young men and women but since I am in, in touch with mostly the boys even though I do a lot of girls, I referee for the girls and I see the girls.  The girls and you can see I can correlate this with the girls in the Olympics also.  More team with the women than it is with the men.  Look at the difference, look at the success.  The success of the women and I, I think the girl that they interviewed after the Olympics put it so well when she talked about they had more experience on the international scene than the men.  She could have even put it another way.  They have more team played than the men.  My hopes and dreams for the young African American in America today is to go back to how we got to where we are.  Go back to all of your great leaders and what was the one thing that was prescribed most?  Education.  Education.  What's the biggest thing in real estate?  Location.  Location.  And to get further ahead in the world and this country is education, education, education.  You educate yourself.  You make sure that you know it.  And that does not mean you always have to attain a degree to show it.  I saw too many of them bought.  I'm talking about real education.  Learning your craft.  Learning how to deal with the world.  First you gotta deal with yourself.  Get rid of the ego.  Get rid of that.  Get rid of all those distractions that are gonna prevent you from reaching your goal and set your positive goals, set them.  And let everything that you do help you to reach and achieve that goal.  That's my dream for the African American is to seek out these positive goals and take all of the necessary steps to achieve them.  That's what I'm trying to teach my children and that's what I'm trying to teach all the children that I come in contact whether they be young men or women.  You see this is something that we have to have.  Many of our leaders who so called leaders-- many of our leaders they have a different agenda.  And you can apply that same thing that happened to young basketball players to some of our leaders too.  "I" "me" before team.  The team's concept is gone in our society and it's an "I" "me" society.  No one is willing to take the steps without renumeration, recuperation of some kind and until we learn what the whole big picture is and I guess it goes back to our Christianity you know.  What, what, what is we serving God, a man or who?  Are we serving "I"?  That is the thing that I think we must look at in a perspective that's going to help not just "I" but "we."
Story_ID: 269964
Speaker 1: When you look back on all the things that you've done in life, working with youth and in sports, is there any major thing that you would change?
Speaker 2: Oh, you're coming at me with some big ones now.  Because I'm trying--you trying to--I'm trying to reach out and nothing jumps at me right now but there's so many different things because first thing that comes to mind is the education.  We have to change that because I look at I look at all of the bright eyed goals that supposed to be instituted.  Let's say when the lottery came along.  Didn't somebody say 80 percent of all monies generated by the lottery is supposed to go to education?  I don't see how our education system is struggling for funds if 80 percent of all of the money that was generated from the lottery go to education?  Something went wrong somewhere.
Speaker 1: Well you know how it was explained to me?  They said they had a budget for education already for so many dollars.  They took that money someplace else and spend it on something else.  Then they took--put the lottery money in that same budget line item so the amount has never been increased it's just that all the lottery money goes into education budget.
Speaker 2: And education budget then replaced by lottery budget.  Okay.  Well I'm glad you explained that to me because--
Speaker 1: That's because I wondered the same thing you know.  I mean it's, it's a horrible thing you know.
Speaker 2: That's horrible, that's terrible.
Speaker 1: But is there anything in your life that you would change you know if you had to change it?
Speaker 2: Or going back?
Speaker 1: Yeah right.
Speaker 2: Don't look back.  What did Satchel Paige say, don't look back somebody might be gaining on you no.  I, I, I try not to, I try not to.  I, I would change, I would change I, I can't change it.  I don't even think about that--
Story_ID: 269965
Speaker 1: Let's not even deal with it then.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Let's go on to this next question and that is when you look back on everything you've done so far, what would you consider at this point to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Oh I've definitely because it's been, it's been given to me.  My legacy has been determined by the developments of what has happened to all these old men that I've dealing with for the last eighteen years or so the senior basketball.  That's obviously gonna be my legacy but what I'd like to be, I'd like to have it come through my children.  What happens to them?  What are their achievements you know?  What will they be able to say their father did for them?  That would be what I hoped to be my legacy would be my children.
Story_ID: 269966
Speaker 1: How many do you have?
Speaker 2: I have Ryan Brown [ph.], who's the youngest boy, he's nineteen.  I have Rosalin Brown [ph.] who's the youngest girl, she's fifteen and I have Rolland Brown [ph.] who is thirty-five.  And then I have a grandson, who's Justin [ph.], and he is two years old May 30 [2004] this year.
Story_ID: 269967
Speaker 1: The last question is similar to legacy but a little different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As a person who gave of himself.  Who wanted to be remembered by not what he achieved but what he was able to help others to achieve and a person that was hey just a guy that grew up from a you know the ghetto, humble you know background and hard working parents [Ruby McClure Brown and Reginald Brown] and the guy that hey he wasn't Sweet Charlie Brown [HistoryMaker Charles Brown], he was a, he was, he was Little Charles, that's what they called me in the neighborhood.  He was Little Charles that got along with the rest of the guys and hey when you ask him to get something you know it wasn't no problem.  And that was it.  Good guy, that's all.  One of the guys in the neighborhood wanted to be remembered as not the egghead not the guy that you know too hard to get along with.  I, I was always the guy that everybody could get along with.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Well thank you, sir.
Speaker 2: Hey, thank you.
