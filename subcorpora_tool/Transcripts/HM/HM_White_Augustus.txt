Speaker 1: This HistoryMakers [The HistoryMakers] interview is being conducted with [HistoryMaker] Dr. Augustus A. White III, one of the, if not the, most foremost orthopedic surgeons in the world.  The site of the interview is at the home of Dr. White, 10 Brenton Road, Weston Massachusetts, and the date is April 21, year 2005.  The interviewer is [HistoryMaker] Robert C. Hayden and the videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Mr. HistoryMaker, Dr., would you state your full name for me and spell your name?
Speaker 2: It's Augustus A. White III, and Augustus is A-U-G-U-S-T-U-S, A represents Aaron which is A-A-R-O-N, White is W-H-I-T-E, and then the Roman numeral three.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What year were you born and where were you born?
Speaker 2: I was born in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1936.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And how would you describe or define your occupation?
Speaker 2: My occupation I would describe as one of an academic orthopedic surgeon and by academic I mean to imply that the career path includes in addition to surgical care and care of patients, it includes a substantial amount of teaching, substantial amount of writing, substantial amount of research, and it's a combination of those things that usually applies the term academic surgeon.  My area of specialization within orthopedics and within surgery was spine surgery, and so that's the way I would describe my, my career.
Story_ID: 307791
Speaker 1: Now, you carry all this out with various positions or titles and affiliations.  Would you provide the titles that you now hold and your affiliations?
Speaker 2: Sure.  Currently, and I, I should've--the academic component of this career in recent years as I've phased out of clinical care and surgery has shifted more toward the educational side of things.  And I mention that because my current titles are, I'm master of the Oliver Wendell Holmes Society at Harvard Medical School [Boston, Massachusetts] and I, I will explain that.  I'm professor of orthopedic surgery at Harvard Medical School and I am the Ellen Gordon professor of medical education [Ellen and Melvin Gordon Professor of Medicine and Medical Education] at Harvard Medical School.  Actually, I, I should correct that and say Ellen and Melvin Gordon, parenthesis, the Tootsie Roll [Tootsie Roll Industries, Chicago, Illinois] people.  These are some very generous benefactors of Harvard Medical School who gave an endowed chair and they have done a great deal more than that for Harvard Medical School, and it's just nice to identify them.  Everybody knows Tootsie Rolls.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so, so I'm professor of, of medical education.  And so, in, in, in--let me go back to the society.  Our medical school is a large school with about 160 members per class and in order to take a large school and make several smaller schools, it has developed what they call societies, and there are five societies of Harvard Medical School and they all have names of prominent alumni, et cetera.  And Oliver Wendell Holmes was the first dean of Harvard Medical School and the father of the Chief Justice, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.  And this particular--the, the societies then have groups of about forty students per class in each, each society and there are two other senior professors that work with me in my particular society, a, a staff administrator, an educator with a master's degree type education level, and together, we are responsible for mentoring, advising, nurturing if you will, problem solving, inspiring, whatever we can do to enrich and protect the development of the careers of, of these young students who are starting medical school and going through the whole four years.  Also, we have about one-fifth of the curriculum that we (cough) sort of are the ambassadors of or we interface between the medical school and the teachers of these very specialties.  For example, as master of the home society, I am responsible for radiology, for surgery, and for obstetrics and gynecology, and we meet with the course directors and the course leaders and the teachers from periodically to look at organizational structure, educational objectives, problem solving, enrichment, et cetera.  Of interest also right now, the medical school is undergoing curriculum reform wherein we're looking at the way students are educated and we're sort of reviewing the whole spectrum of challenges of, of student education, and this gives me an opportunity to participate and be involved and hopefully make contributions in that area.  Also, something that I think we've--have discussed in the past, there's an opportunity--I, I chair a committee in the medical school.  Actually about ninety people volunteered and involved in the committee and they're probably a nucleus of about twenty who are working closely in what we're calling--what is, in fact, culturally competent care education.  And this is a very important mission and a very important opportunity.  Because as you know, there are thirteen groups of people in our society who receive slightly inferior and even substantially inferior care because of their particular group identity, and culturally competent care is--addresses this so that our medical students are educated in a way that they are sensitized to this and they're careful when they're dealing with someone of a culture other than their own to, to adjust and make certain that they pay appropriate attention to this so that these--this is part of the reason we have these health disparities.  It's not the only reason, but it is a substantial part of it. So this is a, a tremendous opportunity and, and, and I--I'm happy to have a, a--an energetic group of talented faculty to work with in an institution that is supporting it as much as it can right now and we're seeking additional support to go forward with that.  So that's, that's sort of my current--well, other aspects of my current professional life involve some outside consulting.  I, I serve on a couple of corporate boards, orthopedic related companies, and I serve on some not-for-profit boards and that keeps up some of my activity.  And then I'm committed to, to complete several texts and I have several writing commitments, so that kind of keeps me going also.  But it, it, it makes for a stimulating opportunity and I, I enjoy all of these things and so that's kind of the current status of my--
Speaker 1: Well, thank you for that introduction.  And we're gonna talk about some of your publications later on in our--in our conversation.
Story_ID: 307792
Speaker 1: Before we go on with the so-called more formal part of the interview, we have some kind of warm-up questions, People magazine type questions--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --human interest questions.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So that people when they listen to you in your HistoryMakers [The HistoryMakers] interview also have this side of your personality, okay?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: What is your favorite food, Dr. White [HistoryMaker Dr. Augustus A. White III]?
Speaker 2: New Orleans [Louisiana] gumbo I would say (laughter).  And it's actually the only thing I know how to cook, that plus coffee and things.  I shouldn't brag about that, but actually one of my good colleagues and friends from, from my work life, Joe Henry [Joseph L. Henry], who may well be in this category that we're working on here, but Joe Henry is from New Orleans.  He was dean at the--at the Harvard Medical School [Boston, Massachusetts] for a period of time, dean at Howard medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] for a while.  Anyway, Joe Henry has absolutely the best gumbo in the world.
Speaker 1: I have been to his gumbo parties--
Speaker 2: All right, so you--
Speaker 1: --so I know (laughter).
Speaker 2: You fully understand what I'm talking about.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And, and he's actually provided the recipe and I, I joke with my friends when I say that, you know, when I, I do it, I, I don't have any delusions that I'm doing it as a gourmet cook.  But I do it the way you would do a, a chemistry laboratory process.  You just follow--you just do what--you, you don't think about it--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you don't have any emotions in it, you just follow it step by step.  And it's such a great recipe that it comes out terrific.
Speaker 1: That's--
Speaker 2: And I'll say this, I even had the courage to invite Joe for some of it when he was in town some years ago and Joe, of course, as most people from New Orleans think they make absolutely the best of whatever it is, there's no question.  So I was very careful.  I never asked him what he thought about it and I was--I just waited to see what he was gonna say, and he asked for another bowl.
Speaker 1: Is Joe still living or did he pass?
Speaker 2: Joe--as far as I know, Joe is still living.  He lives in San Francisco [California].
Speaker 1: Oh, does he?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And I have not heard any--in fact--
Speaker 1: The reason I ask 'cause I guess I haven't seen or heard about him in so long and so I was--
Speaker 2: No, I think he's okay because--
Speaker 1: I know his wife passed.  I know that.
Speaker 2: Yes, that's correct.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: And he remarried.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I'm pretty sure that if he had not--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, if he was not around--
Speaker 1: You would know.
Speaker 2: --I would know about it.
Speaker 1: You would know, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But, yeah, so it's--and I like a--I have a whole lot of enthusiasm for a lot of other foods also I must say, but if you say favorite, then I'd, I'd go with that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: I would say the fall, yeah.  I love the colors.  I, I have conscious and subconscious memories of, of football in the grass and the dirt and, and, and it's that time of the year for football, which I enjoy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Speak of the colors, what's your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Gosh, I don't know if I really have a--
Speaker 1: Do you have a--
Speaker 2: --favorite color.  I--no, I don't know.  I guess blue.  I do like blue a lot.  But, yeah, I guess that would be it, yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I go to Sweden a lot and I enjoy Sweden a lot.  I like to be in the--in, in Florida in the wintertime.  I don't do it as much as I'd like. My favorite city in the whole world is San Francisco.  And so--but, I, I don't really plan vacations.  I, I plan as many business trips as I can and--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: --and I surround it with a day here and there.  I guess I would say Sweden because over the years that's where I've gone on vacation more than anywhere else now after all these years.
Speaker 1: Well, you received a Ph.D. there--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and later on--and I'll talk--we wanna hear about that experience.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, last warm-up question.  Favorite phrase or saying, do you have one?
Speaker 2: I tend to say, "Life is as it is."
Story_ID: 307793
Speaker 1: Family background.  We wanna explore your family background so that we have a context and we have a foundation through which to look at your socialization as you grew up and moved into your adult career and so on, and we should start really with your mother, so would you--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --give me your mother's name, tell me when she was born and, and where she was born?
Speaker 2: Yes. Her name is Vivian Dandridge, her maiden name, White, and she was born in Woodstock, Tennessee, and I'm terrible with dates, but she was born 1912.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's correct, yes.
Speaker 1: All right.  What has she told you--what did she tell you about her growing up years in Woodstock?  Did she share childhood memories with you?
Speaker 2: Some.
Speaker 1: Her child--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.  She--not in a--in a--in a bragging way at all, but just kind of as a matter of fact way.  Her sisters were school teachers and she was the youngest of thirteen children, several of whom did not survive early childhood and infancy, infancy.  But I guess, three, four, five, six, eight or so did, and a couple of them were school teachers, two of her older sisters were school teachers.  And she kind of hung out at the school long before she was supposed to.  And as a result of that and whatever else, whatever talent and aptitude she may have had, she ended up being way ahead of herself in school and--two years or more ahead.  And she just talked about that a little bit and in some ways I guess it was a, a disadvantage, you know, because she was kind of not as mature and socially a little different. But, but she got along okay and she kind of learned to survive.  She'd tell me a little bit about--not a lot of anecdotes, but talk about her father [Sidney Dandridge] some, and, and her other sisters.  She enjoyed school.  She liked to play around, play a lot, and she--at that time, there was not much in the way of organized athletics or anything like that, so she didn't, didn't do a lot of that.  But she--while I don't remember a lot of the specifics, she reflected a, a warm, positive family experience with--I mean, she never complained about anything or, or seemed disappointed, you know, mistreated or, you know, didn't like her sisters or her sisters didn't like her or anything like that, so it, it, it came over as, as a positive kind of thing, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did she have an occupation of work--during your childhood and teenage years, did she work?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did.  She didn't work until--my father [Augustus White, Jr.] died when I was about eight years old and after that, she, she--up to that point she had been a, a home keeper and a mother and so forth.  And after that, she did look for work and ended up working herself as an English teacher in a--in a middle school and then subsequently in a high school, and also as a librarian.  And she also did some coaching.  She liked coaching youngsters to--in oratory and reciting poems and reciting other soliloquies and things of that sort.  And this was something that--and, and she did it in a--in competitive basis around the, the community.  She also did a little bit of--that, that was a popular time in Memphis [Tennessee] when people were doing a lot of amateur acting.  They actually produced a number of plays the way you might do it as college students or graduate students.  These were postgraduates and there was a era of several years, I don't know how long, maybe eight or ten when a number of people did various plays.  And she did some acting and then some directing, and she'd help direct plays at her high school, too; there's extracurricular plays that the students were doing.  She enjoyed teaching a lot.  She enjoyed young people a lot and she, you know, collected a few, not a lot but a few, what should I say, stepchildren in addition to me along the way and I, I was friendly and knew some of them, some of them I didn't, but she--
Speaker 1: Where did she prepare to be a teacher?
Speaker 2: At LeMoyne [LeMoyne Normal and Commercial School], what is now known as LeMoyne-Owen College in Memphis, Tennessee.  Both she and my aunt who was also a school teacher--well, I had two aunts who were school teachers.  One I, I knew and lived longer than the other one, but the, the one that she--that taught that I knew the best went to Lemoyne also.
Story_ID: 307794
Speaker 1: Tell me about her mother and father, your grandparents on your mother's [Vivian Dandridge White] side.  You mentioned her father briefly.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell me their names.
Speaker 2: Yes.  The father was Sidney Dandridge and the--my mom's mother was Van Pelt, Lenora Van Pelt.
Speaker 1: Could you spell that for me?
Speaker 2: V-A--V-A-N, P-E-L-T.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: Van Pelt.  And--I'm sorry, it's Lucy, Lucy Van Pelt [Lucy Van Pelt Dandridge].  I don't know why I said Lenora.  Lenora [Lenora Goodman White] is my paternal grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, my--I guess the, the--my mother's father was kind of an interesting character in that he--his father was a doctor and his mother was a I guess you'd call mulatto and the father was Caucasian.  And my father was allowed to, to live and be in the home with his biological father.  I'm not sure quite where his biological mother was, but he lived in the home with the biological father, the doctor, and his wife.  And at about age fifteen, somehow his half-siblings, I don't know how many there were but there were more than one, sort of learned about him and learned that his mother was a woman of color.  And they, I guess, I don't know what the level of ridicule or whatever it was, but he just left home at age fifteen and ended up--I don't know how he got from point A to point B, but ended up being a rather successful businessman, and entrepreneur as his life developed.  And he, he had several businesses.  He had a, a cotton gin and he had a, a store, a blacksmith shop, and a number of businesses.  And actually I--I'm not a, a, a good historian, but I learned somewhere along the way, I heard someone say that a lot of people who were, were children, biological children of whites through these kinds of relationships would one way or another kind of set 'em up in business.  And I never heard that connection through my own family and I never thought about it.  But it may well have been that kind of thing because I don't know where you get the wherewithal to develop all these businesses if you leave home at age fifteen.  But be that as it may, that may be some of that--some of that history.  On the maternal side, I, I, I don't know the specifics other than--I mean my grandmother, other than she was clearly part Native American as well as African American and--at least had features suggestive of that.  And people that--my, my daughter now asked me, you know, what tribe dad, don't you know that, you know, all the things I don't know I wish I did know, but I've been advised that if it was in Tennessee, the odds are overwhelmingly that they were Cherokee, so--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that's, that's that background.
Speaker 1: Good.
Story_ID: 307795
Speaker 1: Tell me about your father, his name, and when he was born and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --where he was born.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My father's name was Augustus A. White, Jr.  He was born in, in Holly Springs, Mississippi.  And his dad was--
Speaker 1: The year?
Speaker 2: Year would--I, I think 1901.
Speaker 1: All right.  Thank you.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I don't know a lot about his dad [Augustus White, Sr.] other than he was a--he was--he had a store.  He had a general store in the town and he ran that store and he had two sons, my uncle who ended up living and working in Chicago [Illinois].  And his, his wife was named Lenora Goodman.  Her--that was her, her maiden name and then my grandfather married her.  And don't know so much about her either other than I think there probably was some mixture of African American and, you know, whatever else as it--as it was during those--during those days.  So that--that's essentially my father's two parents.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did your father share with you stories about his growing up years at all?
Speaker 2: My father was a very, very hard working general practitioner in Memphis [Tennessee] when there were just a handful of doctors there.  He was a house physician at, at Terrell Memorial Hospital [Memphis, Tennessee] along with a, a Dr. Watson [Dr. N.M. Watson] who was the head physician there for a number of years.  And I, I, I spent a lot of time--my dad would put me between his knees and talk to me and advise me and tell me what I was supposed to do in a very warm and loving way, but we didn't hang out together very much; there wasn't much time for that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And so I, I heard not much about his experiences.  I, I learned--
Speaker 1: And you said that he passed when you were eight--
Speaker 2: Eight years old.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  And, and I, I learned more about him from his brother, my uncle, and other people that I met from time to time over the years, so I, I, I feel like I, I know him and know what he was like and, of course, from my mother [Vivian Dandridge White] also.  So--but I, I never directly had him share or tell me much about his childhood.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Where did he study medicine?
Speaker 2: He studied at Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee]--
Speaker 1: At Meharry.
Speaker 2: --medical school, yes.
Speaker 1: What year did he graduate?  How far back--
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh, I'm terrible with--he--I think--wait a minute, I did look--I was--'36 [1936], '46 [1946], I think forty--let's see, '34 [1934] probably in that--in that range.  I should remember.  I, I, I learned that he was same class at a different school but of, of a distinguished African American physician and, and happily a mentor and friend of mine over the years and that's Dr. Cobb, Dr. Montague Cobb [William Montague Cobb].  They--I--Dr. Cobb pointed out to me at one point--Dr. Cobb, as you know, is a phenomenal historian among many other things.  But he pointed out--yeah, well I graduated the same year your dad from medical school, so I, I remember that.  And anyway, he--he's quite a guy.  I think--I think--
Speaker 1: During our break, I wanna ask you about something regarding Dr. Cobb, very specific of which I don't think you're aware of my relationship to him--
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: --but we can talk about that so we should later (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Good.  Good.
Story_ID: 307796
Speaker 1: The fact that your father [Augustus White, Jr.] was a physician and, of course, you were eight years old roughly when he passed, but was his profession in any way influence your decision later on to become a doctor?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think must have.  I think it had.  I--it, it was kind of interesting.  You know, I, I had friends whose fathers of course lived longer and, and, male friends, and, and I guess at some level, most fathers and sons--I mean, I, I don't know if everybody does, but they go through this evolutionary process of, of competition and challenge and maturation and that kind of thing.  And, and I didn't experience that, but what I did experience and, and I remember it very well, and it was--it's, it's a bittersweet kind of experience, mostly sweet.  But my dad had a really fine reputation in Memphis [Tennessee] and as you probably know in the South when elderly people meet young people, they say, "Hello, boy, good day, how you feeling?"  And the next question is "What are you gonna be when you grow up, boy?"  And, you know, you know that.  And so, so of course I heard that.  And it--and it was, "You gonna be a fine doctor like your daddy?"  You know, "Your daddy was a fine man," you know?  And, and even without that context, my friends who knew him from time to time, they'd just see me around, I'd be playing with some of the kids and they'd say, you know, your dad was a fine man.  Your dad was a good man.  He was such a good doctor.  He was a good man.  And, and so I didn't have him to compete with, but I had his reputation to compete with (laughter).  And, but anyway, it, it was--so it was a source of I think inspiration and, and competition.  And, and having said all that, though, I mean he never said "I want you to be a doctor."  My mother [Vivian Dandridge White] never said, "I want you to be a doctor."  But people did say, "Are you gonna be one" (laughter), you know?  And, but I really think that I was sort of one of these kids and, and they're--you know, legitimately have--they're a lot of--a lot around.  I don't know about your family, your daughter, but, but I was one of these kids that at five or four or whatever thought I wanted to be a doctor, you know?  I really did.  And it just seemed natural.  I, I just felt like that.  And, and there would always be a couple of other things when the people would ask me, you know, grown folks would ask me.  I'd say well I don't know I wanna be a doctor or--and the other two things would always change, but the doctor would always be there.  And the other would be things like, at one point I wanted to be a private detective and at one point I--somehow I heard that sanitary workers earned a ton of money and I don't know where I got that idea, but I--but anyway, that was on the list for a while.  And then just--a teacher, teacher was on there a lot, and that was there.  At, at one point I wanted to be a math teacher, and--but anyway, I believe that it was just--as I said, I think a lot--I work with students all the time.  I think a lot of people for whatever reason, whatever they--complex genetics or personality variables are, they think they wanna be a doctor, and that's what they wanna be, so that's kinda--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the story there.
Speaker 1: Do you have any siblings or did you have siblings?
Speaker 2: I do not.  I have not had any (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You were the only child.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Only, only one.
Story_ID: 307797
Speaker 1: What are your earliest, farthest back memories of growing up in Memphis [Tennessee]?  How far back can you remember?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember--it's funny you mention siblings.  I remember very well--we lived in the hospital [Terrell Memorial Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee].  We had an apartment in the hospital and I didn't have any siblings and I remember--what I remember most is being very lonesome.  There were no kids to play with, you know?  And, and I would go out in the hospital grounds; there was a, a large lawn with two or three tiers of hills right in front.  And I'd go out there and walk around there and, and--you know, that was--that was fun.  That was okay.  And actually my mom [Vivian Dandridge White]--I was always--well, pretty obedient.  She, she conditioned me to stay away from the driveway where the ambulances came in, so I stayed away from there.  And I would just be very comfortable out on this field.  And there was a, a little boy about my age who lived about a half a block away up the street and occasionally I would, you know, get to play with him.  He would come by, his mom would bring him by, whatever.  And--but I remember going out and, and kind of trying to get his attention, so I yell down the street hoping that he'd hear me or something and, and 99 percent of the time he didn't.  And I had playmates, you know, and my mom would occasionally--you know, we'd kind of organize it and I'd meet the other playmates.  But I, I remember it, it--I always thought, boy wouldn't be nice if I had a brother right here or something to, to play with.  So that would be--those would be some of my early recollections.  And being around the hospital.  You know, I could--again, I knew where I could and couldn't go.  So I used to walk around and, you know, I remember the x-ray machines made a ton of noise that they used.  I'd go down and hang around the x-ray department in the hospital, look.  And so that, that I, I, I remember very well.  And--yeah.
Story_ID: 307798
Speaker 1: Other earliest memories of growing up in Memphis [Tennessee], living at the hospital site [Terrell Memorial Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee] was interesting.  What else do you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --remember as a--in those very early years?  Anything--
Speaker 2: Well I--
Speaker 1: --else stand out?
Speaker 2: I enjoyed--I had--you know, I got--as I got a little older I had more and more playmates and friends to, to play with and enjoyed that, some friends that I kept for many years.  And that was--that was--that was fun.  That was enriching.  I went to a little bit--a little bit of time at private school, then I went to public school most of the time.
Speaker 1: Where did you start your schooling?
Speaker 2: Well I--let's see, Potts kindergarten [Ms. Potts' kindergarten, Memphis, Tennessee], I guess.
Speaker 1: Potts?
Speaker 2: Potts, P-O-T-T-S, kindergarten.
Speaker 1: Is that public or private?
Speaker 2: It was private, yeah.  And then I went--I ended up going to Manassas, which was one through twelve, Manassas High School which--in Memphis.  And that's where I had most of my--you know, up, up--all the way up until I left to go to, to prep school.  And, and--yeah, I had good time at--in, in high school and went back and forth, bounced around between, you know, fighting off the kids with, you know, some of the in-group issues that we have about skin color and that kind of thing, and--
Speaker 1: How many years were you at Potts?
Speaker 2: I was--well, I was--I would say a year and a half or something like that, yeah.
Speaker 1: So you were five or six as this was--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --very early on?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  This was before.  I mean, this was even preschool.
Speaker 1: Oh, preschool.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  Right.  And, and I ended up going to Manassas starting in the first grade.
Speaker 1: That was elementary school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: Public?
Speaker 2: Public, yeah.  And I would've been five then because I, I started a year--a full year ahead of myself, which is--so, yeah.  So I was bouncing around there.  And then I, I, I liked school.  I had fun in school and had some good teachers.  As, as you well know, the segregated schools in the South, whatever they may have lacked in terms of economic support and resources, to a large degree, that was compensated for by the most dedicated teachers you can ever imagine.  I mean, that's an amazing--I mean, they were so committed and I mean it was almost like--the, the, the gunpowder for revolution was--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --was education, you know?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And they, they lived that.
Speaker 1: I heard the same thing yesterday from Dr. Ken Elan [ph.].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He told me the same thing.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So--anyway, so that was nice.  That was enjoyable.  And, and, you know, we worked hard and so forth.  And, and--
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers that stand out in your mind today that were influential in your early schooling or anybody in particular?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I would say so.  I mean, I think--I, I remember having a very good English teacher, I thought, who was able to help tremendously with understanding English from a analytical or in terms of grammar and syntax and that kind of thing.  I thought she was dedicated and clear.  We had a, a, a--one of our male teachers was very positive and I got to know him a bit.  He was the art teacher.  I wasn't that much into art, but, you know, he was kind of a role model in a sense and--Walter Guy was his name.  The English teacher was Miss Boyd [ph.].  But I, I, I hate to name some without naming all because they were--so many were really very, very good.
Story_ID: 307799
Speaker 1: And then I had an interesting kind of experience at a young age in that I got involved with boxing at age ten and it was--in, in Memphis [Tennessee], Memphis had some unique characteristics.  And the sports in Memphis were football, which was overwhelmingly a huge a sport and they had track, which was not very much--very well developed, and then they had--they had no basketball.  But they had boxing and boxing was really a big deal, and it went from antweight, which was like 60 pounds all the way up through heavyweight.  And it was kind of modeled after the Golden Gloves, and the competition was pretty good.  It was pretty good.  And it turns out as an interim I, I, I had a--I had a stepfather who was a boxing coach at one of the other schools.  So anyway, I ended up getting involved with that a bit and, and it was a--it was an interesting experience because I kind of--you know, it was very helpful to me 'cause I said I was having these little--people to get off my back, you know, and, and, and that kind of thing.  And that was an evolutionary change and, and it got me interested in sports and, and appreciating sports and the value of sports and so forth.  Anyway, that, that Memphis--oh, the other thing about that experience was that there was kind of an understood and inclusive teaching of history, African American history.  And--for example, in one of those grades, I heard a wonderful lecture by Mary McLeod Bethune who was brought to our little high school to speak to us, you know?  And I heard jazz concerts with people that included Hank Crawford, you know, the jazz concerts.  And, and just several outstanding musicians who came through and, and, and all the college--the, the bands in this high schools were like--they, they could jam.  It was like jazz bands, you know, really good musicians.  And so that was culturally--I mean, no one was necessarily--well, I don't know who was thinking about it, what they were thinking, but it, it didn't seem like it was, okay we're gonna present in your culture, it was just part of the process, you know, and--but it--I--it, it was very enriching and it, it, it added enormously to, to quality of life, you know?  Because I, I really came to understand and enjoy this early, early on.  And, so anyway, that was part of that experience and, and was fun.
Speaker 2: Manassas [Manassas High School, Memphis, Tennessee] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --took you through how many grades?  How long?
Speaker 1: Up through the eighth grade.
Speaker 2: Eighth grade.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, up through the eighth grade.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: And, and, and I, I don't--you know, I remember going to school and having fun, playing sandlot football, and as I said, the, the, the boxing was, was pretty well organized (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What kind of student were you?
Speaker 1: I was I would say A minus student.  Generally, there'd be two or three of us would be at the top of all these little classes, you know, and I, I would generally be in that range.  I, I was pretty impulsive, so I used to get--I didn't get such good grades in conduct, you know, 'cause I just didn't have--you know, I wanted to have fun and I'd do stuff, so--
Story_ID: 307800
Speaker 1: By grade seven and eight [at Manassas High School, Memphis, Tennessee], were you still living in the hospital [Terrell Memorial Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee] accommodations?
Speaker 2: No, no.  We had--we had moved out.  I, I think at around age five, we moved into a regular home and lived with my mom [Vivian Dandridge White], my dad [Augustus White, Jr.], and my dad's mom [Lenora Goodman White], and a, a very special aunt who was--who lived to be 104 and was very sharp, she had been in education, and one of these just very sweet, elderly, wonderful ladies.  So that was--that was that family and, and that was--that was--that was fun.  That was good.
Speaker 1: What was that neighborhood like?  How do you remember the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: It was kind of a--it was--I guess I'd say middle class neighborhood in, in black community standards in the South.  Yeah, it, it, it was--it was that way.  I think, you know, that--there was a businessman on the street and, yeah, I would say sort of middle class, yeah.
Story_ID: 307801
Speaker 1: So you finish grade eight at Manassas [Manassas High School, Memphis, Tennessee].  What was next?  Where did you--
Speaker 2: Next, I, I--a huge, huge change in, in, in my life, I'm sure a life changing event, I guess.  But I ended up going to what was then Mount Hermon [Mount Hermon School for Boys], now known as Northfield Mount Hermon school [Gill, Massachusetts] in Massachusetts, in Northern Massachusetts starting in the ninth grade.  And that was--that was--that was a very interesting, different experience.  I had probably not said more than two or three words to white people in my whole life before going there and then all of a sudden, I get of this train and here I am.  I was there with a, a, a close friend that I had grown up with in Memphis [Tennessee], had gone with me there, and his mom actually went with us on the train up to the school.  And the, the two of us were roommates the first year.  He was actually--even though we were the exact same age, he was a year ahead of me.  He was two years ahead of his age and a brilliant guy with a photographic memory and just fantastic student.
Speaker 1: Well, how'd you happen to go to Mount Hermon, I mean what--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was the--
Speaker 2: That's a very good and reasonable question.  Well, to the best--here's, here's the way that it happened.  Northfield Mount Hermon was probably the first, certainly among the first, very much among the first New England prep schools to have students of color.  And believe it or not, I would be probably the second generation, maybe even the third generation of people who went to the school.  It turns out that, that my friend's father was the professor of biology at, at LeMoyne-Owens College [LeMoyne College; LeMoyne-Owen College, Memphis, Tennessee].  And being among African American scholars and, and college professors, it was kind of known--if you were in education, you kind of knew that--you kind of knew about Mount Hermon, I guess.  And, and because my friend, his son, was so brilliant, he was thinking, well, my goodness, we gotta send him to the best school we can send him to and we're gonna send him to that prep school that, that takes--that takes black students.  And so it, it was known that he was getting ready to go, he was getting ready to do that.  And I was in the kitchen with my mother [Vivian Dandridge White] and my aunt, and as I mentioned, my aunt was in education, and she was avid.  She was a very--I think if she had not been in the South or she'd been somewhere else, she'd have been a, a judge or whatever.  She's a, you know, and it was all in education.  It was all history.  She taught American history, actually.  But anyway--and my mom--and they were actually cooking dinner, and I was just wandering around the kitchen, you know, and saying, yeah, Walter's [ph.] gonna be going away to school and, and, and say, yeah, yeah, he's gonna go to school.  And there was kind of a long pause, and my mother said, "Well how would you like to go to a school like that?"  And there was another long pause, and I said, "Yeah."  And then they began to put it together.  My--and, and we didn't have a whole lot of readily available resources, but my aunt helped put together with my mom.  And then so we applied to several schools and, and there was a Quaker school that I can't remember the name of it now, but we applied there and applied to Northfield Mount Hermon.  Now, one of the things about Mount Hermon is that all students, every student worked ten hours a week and--which is a marvelous educational experience in and of itself, and you did serious work.  I mean, you had to do what you had to do, what you're supposed to do.  And so that's--that was--that saved a lot of money, you know, in terms of overhead, so the school was not as expensive.  The school also had an interesting policy.  It had two tiers of, of tuition.  If you were--came from a family with lots of wherewithal, you paid a slightly different tuition.  Everyone else paid, which was a large portion of the student body this other--at this other rate, and I was able to get a scholarship.  So that combination--and my mom made a lot of sacrifices, too.  She--I, I, I know that.  Anyway, I was able to go.  So Walter and I went.  Walt's mom--Walter's mom rode up on the train with us and, and obviously my folks realized that, again, if, if whatever good education, the best education you could get would be helpful.  And so that was the way that happened.  It turned out the education at Mount Hermon besides being academically very, very helpful, there were a lot of other messages that, that came out of that experience.  There were a lot of other very valuable educational exposures I think.
Story_ID: 307802
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Did you find it a quote, end quote, culture shock when you first got there [Mount Hermon School for Boys; Northfield Mount Hermon, Gill, Massachusetts]--
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: --and how did you feel?
Speaker 1: --again, very, very interesting question.  In retrospect, I can recognize the cultural differences, but I, I didn't--I didn't go there with any either academic or emotional expectations that this is gonna be shocking, this is gonna be different.  You know, I went there with the idea that I wanted to succeed and there were gonna be things to do.  And, and I, I tended to focus on the things that were to be done and the things I wanted to do.  And while there obviously was bias in the environment compared to the environment I was coming from, you know, it was--it was heaven, you know, I mean.  And I--you know, in the--in the--in the South as a kid, you pick up a lot of savvy from listening, listening to the older people talk, experiencing the world as you experience it.  And, and so, kids have a lot of street smart or I call it southern smart or whatever you wanna call it, black smart, you know, whatever you wanna call it.  So I was--I had that kind of background and, and I wasn't obviously looking for trouble.  And, and, you know, most of the people there by far were, were straightforward people.  I mean, the school has a, a religious background or, you know, belief in brotherhood, brotherly love and, and that kind of thing and mutual respect and--so for the most part, it was not a problem.  Now, in retrospect--and also, there were some incidents.  I mean, there--clearly, there were some incidents.  And, and, and--but I learned to deal with them--I mean, that environment allowed me to learn to deal with them in a way that I think has been enormously helpful to me all the rest of my life, you know, in, in many, many, many different ways.  But--and, and it was interesting too because other, other kind of middle class black kids who came to the school had their own orientation and, and we're, again, reasonably sophisticated about these minors, having been around their folks and listening to them and that kind of thing.  So I didn't experience a lot of culture shock, I really did not.  I--as I said, I learned a lot of new things.  The, the, the items, you know, as you can imagine as, as things evolve, there were individual professors who, who were probably bigoted, you know, there were some.  And, and they would--you know, occasionally, a remark would be made and, and, and we'd kind of get together and support one another and talk about it, and--but there were no, you know, sit-ins or demonstrations.  It was not that era.  It was--you know, it was the '40s [1940s] (laughter) and the early '50s [1950s].  It wasn't the '60s [1960s] of course, so--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But there was--there was a handful of, of students who did well, you know, both on the athletic field and, and in the classroom--
Story_ID: 307803
Speaker 1: What was your work assignment [at Mount Hermon School for Boys; Northfield Mount Hermon, Gill, Massachusetts]?  You said everybody--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --worked.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What did you do?
Speaker 2: Interesting.  And, and the, the good thing about the work, too, is like, like the outside world, if you did a good job and you worked hard, you, you kind of got--you know, you moved--you get--you got the better jobs.  Everybody had to work to get the better job.  My first job was cleaning toilets; that was my first job.  And that was--you know, wasn't the best job.  Wasn't the best job.  And I had a racial incident around that as a matter of fact.  And, but anyway, that was my first job.  And I--what I wanted to do, I learned--I mean as, as I saw the jobs and I looked around, was to be a waiter, and there were several reasons for that.  One is I knew I could satisfy my appetite in that position 'cause I was in and out of the kitchen the whole time.  The other thing is I--part of the culture in the South that I grew up in, waiters, that was a very respected--I mean the--a respected job and you, you earned as much money as anybody else in the community basically if you were a professional waiter, if you were really good and you worked in--so it had a sense of sophistication, and I had learned some of that, again, sitting around listening to the adults.  And, and the other way--the other thing was you had a lot more free time because you had to be at the dining room to eat anyway, so if you're waiting tables, you're, you're paying your dues and so, so anyway, I aspired to that and, and while I had a lot of trouble with my supervisor in the toilet cleaning job, I was--managed to be a substitute waiter and, and learn my way around the dining room, so ended up getting to be a waiter after the--after my first year.  And then I moved on up and I got to be a faculty waiter, which is, you know, the elite waiters, and you--it--it's very nice.  And, and, and, and again, I was bringing all this basic professionalism from my southern heritage and they thought--you know, they thought it was the greatest thing in the world, you know?  Faculty members wanted to sit at my table, you know, and--because it, it was fun for me to do.  And actually, that even--being a waiter--I, I worked as a carhop in the summers too, but I think being a waiter has helped me as a caregiver, a service provider, as a physician, you know?  I mean, some of that stuff spills over and, and, you know, I'm, I'm comfortable with that, I enjoy it.  So, and then even they had head waiters also, and head waiters, all you had to do is you put on a nice white coat and you just walk--the dining room was a very long dining room, about two or three basketball courts in length and the tables were all--and you just kind of walked back and forth and supervise and observe things.  I was not a head waiter but I got invited to be a substitute frequently when the head waiters weren't there, so I would--they would ask me and I'd do that.  So--but that was a good evolutionary process, you know?  If, if, if you do the right thing and do it well, you know, you can--you can move up, whatever your color is, you know? So--
Story_ID: 307804
Speaker 1: What was your best or favorite subject at Mount Hermon [Mount Hermon School for Boys; Northfield Mount Hermon, Gill, Massachusetts] in terms of your academic (simultaneous) --
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --program?  What did you kind of gravitate for--towards and hold onto?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I--well I liked the biology.  I, I certainly liked the biology because you relate it to medicine.  But the other thing I liked, we had to take, they called it Bible, but we had to take some course each semester in either Bible or religious studies, and I really like the religious studies.  I really kind of got into the--philosophy is too strong a term, but, you know, it bordered on philosophy, but discussing the religion, the concepts of religion, the different religions, and understanding of religion and all that was fun, I liked that.  But clearly I'd say the biology was, was the thing I liked most, but I did enjoy also religion.
Speaker 1: Backing up just a little bit--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and then getting into the sciences, was church life a part of your life growing up in Memphis [Tennessee]?  And if so, what was your church like?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Well, I--my maternal grandmother [Lucy Van Pelt Dandridge] went to church.  She was, you know, one of like the female deacons, deacon--you know, that's not the right term, but you know what I mean.  Most other people would know what I mean.  And she, she was the most avid churchgoer in, in our family.  And I would go with her a lot to church, and I, I liked it, you know, it--I'd be up with the little--the kids and we'd joke a little bit and, you know, we'd, we'd wonder who's gonna shout that day and what's it gonna be like, and--but I, I liked the music and, and I, I liked the oratory.  I've, I've always admired good speakers, good orators.  And, and so I enjoyed some of the sermons and trying to listen to that.  And, you know, I didn't have any kind of depth of religious feeling.  It was--it was--it was emotional and, and--you know, and I went and, and, and that was--that was sort of it.  My mother [Vivian Dandridge White] actually was Episcopalian and she in, in, in her adult life went to church a fair amount.  And, of course, at Mount Hermon, chapel was part of it.  You, you were required to go to chapel on Sunday and, and once a week Wednesday, Wednesday evening.  And one of the wonderful things about that was I learned--we had a phenomenal organist in, in the school, and, and he played Bach [Johann Sebastian Bach] and, and a lot of wonderful classical music.  And we also had a choral group that sang religious music but also sang classical music, you know, Beethoven's [Ludwig van Beethoven] '9th' ['Symphony No. 9'] and things like that.  And that was very enriching; I enjoyed that immensely. I ended up--
Speaker 1: Were you in the group?  Choral--
Speaker 2: I finally got in--I got in the choir, yeah.
Speaker 1: You did.
Speaker 2: I did--I, I was not in the elite, you know, the elite singers, never did any solo, but I, I, I finally made it and not everybody made it.  You, you had to try out a while.  But, but the--and I enjoyed the sermons.  I heard Howard Thurman.  I heard--he was there several times during the four years I was there and those kinds of things, of course, very inspiring.  And James S. Robinson was there a couple of times, and, and so that was--that was wonderful.
Story_ID: 307805
Speaker 1: You know, I didn't establish this, but for the record because some people might not know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Mount Hermon [Mount Hermon School for Boys; Northfield Mount Hermon, Gill, Massachusetts] is located in what city?
Speaker 2: In Greenfield--I'm sorry, it's in Northfield, Massachusetts [sic.].
Speaker 1: Northfield.
Speaker 2: It's north of Greenfield.
Speaker 1: Northfield, Mass [Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Northfield, yeah.  And, yeah, it's right up almost into Vermont, as far north as you can get in Massachusetts--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and, yeah.  And it's about fifteen miles north of Greenfield, Mass, which people know.
Speaker 1: Did you play football at Mount Hermon?
Speaker 2: I did, yeah.
Speaker 1: You did?  Oh.
Speaker 2: Yep.  I did.
Speaker 1: What position?
Speaker 2: I played end, yeah, end and defensive halfback also, yeah.  Yeah.  And--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Anything else you wanna say about Mount Hermon before we graduate you and--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.  I guess, I, I would say it was--it was a lucky and wonderful contribution to, to the quality of my life and I'm, I'm very grateful for it.  I enjoyed it.  I grew.  I learned a lot.  In addition to football, I, I, I had the--in fact, I'm--since you asked about sports, I--I'm, I'm happy to report to you that I'm in the Northfield Mount Hermon Athletic Hall of Fame (laughter).  But I, I was--for getting--started getting varsity letters in, in football, wrestling, and lacrosse, and, and I was captain of the football--I mean, of the wrestling team.  And I think religion-wise, you know, it, it taught me, you know, the, the--I think I came away with what my view are many of the positive aspects of, of religion and understanding of people, appreciation of people, respect for people, appreciation for music, and I think it just had--I, I think it just had a good, positive exposure, you know, a group of ideals and, and, you, you know, you learn that not everybody always reaches all ideals and that's, that's what's human about us.  But, but at least you have a, a good frame of reference and, and, so it was, was a good, good opportunity.
Story_ID: 307806
Speaker 1: I don't think I have anything else to say about it.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you graduate from Mount Hermon [Mount Hermon School for Boys; Northfield Mount Hermon, Gill, Massachusetts] in what year?  Nineteen--
Speaker 1: In 1953.
Speaker 2: Fifty-three [1953]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And what was next?  What came next?
Speaker 1: Next, well, I, I went to, to Brown [Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island] after that, and that was--that was a very positive, wonderful experience.  It was the right, right school for me in so many ways.
Speaker 2: What did you major in at Brown University?
Speaker 1: I majored in psychology.
Speaker 2: Psychology?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: What are your most memorable experiences, both positive and maybe negative at some point at Brown?
Speaker 1: Well, let's see.  I don't know if I, I--I'll, I'll worry about the negative later.  Gosh, I don't know, one positive experience after the other.  I, I could just--I don't know where to start, I really don't.  First of all, my roommate was--continues to be a close, lifelong friend.  He was the first peer of mine that I ever actually respected and looked up to, you know.  I mean, he's, he's just a fantastic guy and--I don't know how many--whether you're supposed to name people?  I--so far I haven't named--
Speaker 2: Oh, I think it's important to name people--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --who are important--
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: --in your life, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, his name is Ted Parrish and--
Speaker 2: Tiff?
Speaker 1: Ted Parrish.
Speaker 2: Ted Parrish?
Speaker 1: Parrish.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And he kind of growing up I would say in the slums of Springfield [Massachusetts].  He was maybe a year older than I was, he was.  And he had a tough life, you know?  His father, loving father, but, you know, his father had difficulties with, with, with--it was just a very, very difficult family life.  His mother was living elsewhere and it was very tough for him on a day to day basis.  But he had innately just so much strength, so much character, you know?  It just--it was--he just eluded that everywhere.  And he was--we, we were both pre-meds together.  We both played football, freshmen football together, and we were--you know, we were very close, good friends, very, very competitive, but I just was constantly awed by his, his integrity, his character, his strength, his ambition.  And, you know, whether he came from difficult background or not, it didn't matter, but it was more impressive to me.  I mean, I--it was the kind of stuff that, you know, having come from, from a prep school, you know, where all this is, is embedded in you and then to see that you can--you can get there from a very different background and very different environment.  And then we had a lot of fun together.  And as I said, we're, we're friends to this day.  And, anyway, so that was that.  I had the good fortune and, again, I--naming names, there, there was a coed at Pembroke [Pembroke College, Providence, Rhode Island] who was just a wonderful, delightful lady that I enjoyed, you know, and we, we were--
Speaker 2: What was social life--
Speaker 1: --good friends together.
Speaker 2: --like for you in Providence [Rhode Island] at that time at Brown University (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh--
Story_ID: 307807
Speaker 1: Well Providence [Rhode Island] was, was not the town it is today by any means, and we pretty much, you know, went through Providence to get on the train and get off the train, and, and that was really it.  There was no--you know, if you mean by social life in terms of is there a black community?  Were there African American girls to date or and that kind of thing?  I think it was no, no, no, no.  That is--I, I think that's fair to say.  I don't wanna be unfair to Providence.  I mean, there were--there was a, a, a distinguished family there, was a funeral director and so forth, and, and all.  But there wasn't, you know, certainly not as I knew it in the South where, you know, there's a whole community and a village in the finest sense of the word.  So that was different.  And, and the, the social life, generally there were--there would be four or five guys entered in each class, African American guys, and there would be two or three African American women admitted to Pembroke [Pembroke College, Providence, Rhode Island] on a regular--pretty regular basis.  But Brown [Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island] offered a, a, a terrific education, pre-med preparation.  It offered opportunity for sports.  It, it, it was a--it was a good environment.  I mean, it's a--it's--it's, it's a good--a good school.  I had a unique experience, which again had an impact on my life of being asked to join a quote, unquote, white fraternity [Delta Upsilon Fraternity] and being the first on campus and the first nationally in the fraternity, in that particular fraternity.  And there was a lot of discussion within the fraternity, the undergraduates and the alumni in the city and the town, and, and, you know, whether or not they were gonna quote, unquote, do this.  And then I had to think about whether or not quote, unquote, I was gonna do this, you know?  And it was a very important challenge to me once I decided to do it, not to lose my credibility, my contacts, and my friendships with brothers who chose not to do that or did not have the option to do that or whatever it may be, and I--that was important to me to, to do both of those things.  And, and, and I did, and it was--it was a growth experience I think.  It, it helped me in a lot of ways I believe just in terms of working with people, understanding people, taking risks, you know, being able to, to, to take a challenge and hopefully meet it, but recognize that things could go south or could go wrong.
Story_ID: 307808
Speaker 1: What was the name of the fraternity at Brown University [Providence, Rhode Island] that you were invited to, to join and you decided to, to, to join?
Speaker 2: It was Delta Upsilon [Delta Upsilon Fraternity], yes, and it was a well-respected fraternity.  It had often times the highest academic average and it was a--it, it has--unlike some of the other fraternities, it had no secrets and it's motto was Dikaia Upotheke which is Greek for, justice our foundation.  And there were some interesting iterations and--as referrals to that because that particular chapter, the Brown chapter, was actually censured in one of the subsequent early national meetings for having committed an unfraternal act, which was that of inviting me to join.  And some of the debate related back to this--the motto of the fraternity about justice being the foundation.  The, the brothers in the Brown chapter were courageous by standards of what was going on at that time, and as I said, they, they conferred with local alumni, one of whom was a superior court justice in Rhode Island, Judge Perkins [Fred B. Perkins], who was I think a member--if not a trustee, a member of the Brown Board of Fellows at that time, and he was supportive of, of their decision to, to make this and do this.  However, the national was not.  I mean, there--as you would imagine, there are many southern chapters of the fraternity, and as, as things evolved, I ended up serving as an officer, I was rushing chairman, and then I was pledge chairman, and then ended up being elected president and delegate to the convention, the national convention in the summer, which was to be held at Middlebury College [Middlebury, Vermont], and--
Speaker 1: That's in Vermont?
Speaker 2: That's in Vermont.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.  And interestingly, during the course of the summer that I was home, I got a letter, you know, saying, well, are you planning on coming to the convention, you know?  And I wrote back and said, oh, yeah, I'm planning on coming.  And then I got a phone call saying, "Well, you know, we're a little worried.  We don't want anything to happen at the convention, and there may be some stress and some difficulty, and we're just concerned about that," and I didn't respond.  Then, someone called and said, "You know, we don't want anything to happen and we're, we're concerned about you.  And, and would you consider--have you considered withdrawing?"  So I said, "Well, it's not for me to withdraw."  I said, "I didn't elect myself.  I was elected by my brothers and I'm committed to represent our chapter, so I, I--it's not for me to withdraw.  I've--I, I--yes, I intend to be there."  And, and I said, "And, and some of my brothers are coming with me also."  And I, I think that frightened whoever was, you know, whoever was orchestrating this, this communication channel.  And then they had someone to call me who was a brother in the fraternity at another--in another chapter who had gone to Mount Hermon [Mount Hermon School for Boys; Northfield Mount Hermon, Gill, Massachusetts] who had been my floor officer when I was a sophomore at Mount Hermon and who was probably the only person in Mount Hermon I didn't like (laughter) and he was supposed to call me up on a buddy-buddy phone call to sort of soft--you know, in--coerce me in a friendly way not to go.  So he talked to me a while and, and, and that didn't work either.  And then maybe another two or three weeks went by and we're getting toward the end of the summer, and I got a telegram saying the 1956 national meeting of Delta Upsilon fraternity has been cancelled, and so that, that was it.
Speaker 1: That was it?
Speaker 2: That was it.
Speaker 1: And they cancelled it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  I think one of things amidst whatever or whoever was nervous about what and whatever was motivating whom, I think when I said, yeah, and my brothers are coming with me, I guess they thought I was coming with an army or something to--but--
Speaker 1: What were the--what was the reaction to the Brown chapter Delta Upsilon, what was their reaction to this--
Speaker 2: A lot--a lot of--
Speaker 1: --decision?
Speaker 2: --a lot of anger, a lot of anger.  I mean, they were very--they were more angry than I was.  I mean, I--and it ended up--in the short term, they sent--they sent an adult, you know, centrally hired national secretary of the fraternity about, oh, somewhere in the late fall after this to come around and quote, unquote, explain it and apologize and justify or whatever.  And he, he tried to explain it on the basis of, you know, they didn't want anything to happen to me and didn't want any incidents and so forth and so on and they figured that was the best way to resolve it and so forth.  But, yeah, the, the--a lot of my brothers were, were, were quite, quite angry.
Story_ID: 307809
Speaker 1: And then the, you know, the, the rest of the story as they say is that Brown [Brown University, Providence, Rhode island] ended up partially because of this and for other reasons withdrawing from the national, the, the Brown chapter of Delta Upsilon [Delta Upsilon Fraternity].  And then they re-engaged again.  And then they withdrew a second time, and this time, a Judge Bullock [Terry Bullock], who was the national Delt--grand president, came to Brown to explore why Brown had, had withdrawn.  It turns out, this time, there was an African American dean of students that he was talking with who happened to have been in the fraternity after I'd been in, also happened to have gone to Mount Hermon [Mount Hermon School for Boys; Northfield Mount Hermon, Gill, Massachusetts].  Anyway, he said, "Well, you know, part of this goes all the way back to the incident when you guys cancelled the national convention."  And one thing led to another and the discussions and cont--contr--conversations between Judge Bullock and, and I'm, I'm blocking on my friend's name now, but--it may come to me, but--and Brown ended up expanding to other local Brown alumni and then getting me in the loop and Judge Bullock says, "We are now an international fraternity and we, we are proud of our diversity and we wanna make this thing right.  What can we do?  We wanna re-visit this."  And it was interesting.  I, I talked to some of my brothers, I listened to them, and they tried to think of what we could do to, to--what would be an acceptable way to make this right.  And we came up with a thought, and actually I ended up talking to my friend, Alvin Posad [ph.] about this, too.  And, anyway, we came up with the idea that subsequently Brown had developed what they call investment in diversity, which was a special scholarship fund and I believe the first one in the Ivy League that was sort of generated by and, and led by African Americans with the idea that they would encourage them, not just African Americans, but all the community to contribute so that we'd have scholarship funds.  And this is, of course, before the [U.S.] Supreme Court started talking about special funds for African Americans.  But, anyway, that, that existed and we were raising funds for that.  And we thought, well, if the national made a contribution to the scholarship fund, that would be a nice way that they could support diversity at Brown and they support diversity as part of their agenda, that that would be--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --something to do.  And we passed it around, you know, and the fraternity agreed, Brown agreed, the national agreed, and Judge Bullock agreed, and they said, "Well, we wanna do more than that too, and what we'd like to do is to honor Dr. White [HistoryMaker Dr. Augustus A. White, III] by bringing him back and asking him to speak and awarding him the highest award we have in our fraternity that we give every four or five years or, or--I, I forgotten what the schedule is.  I don't think it's every year, anyway, if, if he would be willing to do that" and so forth.  And this guy, Bullock, is really--he--I, I--you know, I like him.  He's--he was very straight, very sincere, and we talked about it and so forth.  So, anyway, I did up--ended up accepting that and going back and, and making a, a presentation and so forth.
Speaker 2: What year was that?  That was some years later, right?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, many years.  Oh, yeah, many years later.  That would've been probably in the mid-'80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I have in 1986--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --I believe.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, thirty--about thirty years later.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  And it, it was a--it was a good rest of the story I think.  And, and, you know, one of the things that's interesting to think about and talk about, and Ruth Simmons does this so beautifully, is the evolutionary components of diversity.  You know, diversity has a--an evolving concept, it has an evolving reality, has a changing way it's practiced and, and, and where it's going.  And I think it--I think that's exciting and that's kind of an iteration of that I would say.
Story_ID: 307810
Speaker 1: You graduated from Brown University [Providence, Rhode Island] in--
Speaker 2: In 1957.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and what came next?
Speaker 2: I went to--I went to Stanford medical school [Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California] and that was fun and nice.  In fact, I'm going back to Stanford medical school and another--speaking of evolutions or diversity, in another--at, at the beginning of May, Stanford is doing a review of different phases of diversity in its medical school as part of an alumni reunion program, and they've invited me to be on a panel to talk about one era, i.e., I guess I was the first African American student to graduate from Stanford--
Speaker 1: You were?
Speaker 2: --medical school.
Speaker 1: Medical school, yeah.
Speaker 2: Medical school, yeah.  And so it's gonna talk about that and hopefully that will be constructive.  Stanford celebrated the entire university diversity a couple years ago, and it was a beautiful celebration.  Stanford has done very well in sort of the four major areas of Asian Americans, Native Americans, African American, and Latinos in terms of numbers and distribution and, and kind of cultivation of their diversity and celebration of it I think has been very good.
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about the four years at Stanford medical.  What was it like academically and, and otherwise?  What stands out in your memory about medical school?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm, I'm--I think Stanford's a fantastic medical school.  I, I, I--it was--I almost felt guilty.  We enjoyed it so much, when I talk to colleagues in other medical schools, I'd almost feel guilty.  There were only sixty people in the class.  We spent the first two years on campus at Palo Alto [California] and then the other two years traditionally would be in San Francisco [California], and our class was a transition class where Stanford was moving the whole school from San Francisco down to Palo Alto, so we ended up going to San Francisco for a while and then coming back to Palo Alto because the school really had moved down.  Stanford had some fantastic professors and I guess in part because it was a small school and in part because of who they were and, and their commitment to education and to students.  It was just a very enriching, terrific opportunity to learn medicine and how to practice it.  And I had the good fortune of having some specific good mentors, Dr. Victor Richards, who's a, a hero of, of everybody.  I mean, every--he was in that era.  He was just a fantastically virtuoso, wonderful surgeon, but just a great human being who--
Story_ID: 307811
Speaker 1: At what point did you make a decision about your--
Speaker 2: Specialty?
Speaker 1: --specialty surgery and then even within surgery?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Had you made a decision during medical school [Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California] or did that come afterwards?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, it, it, it--it's kind of--it, it, it was a fun evolution.  First of all, I, I, I thought--there was a time in my life during my pre-med, pre-med days at, at Brown [Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island] when I was majoring in psychology that, that my purpose in life and my reason for going to medical school and for being a doctor would be so I could be a psychiatrist, and that was what I thought I wanted to do.  And, and as it turned out, in the summer between college and medical school, I had been working as a lifeguard most of my college days, and I went back to Memphis [Tennessee] and I went and sat up on my lifeguard's chair in the sunshine and feeling very good, looking around, and started thinking about all those fantastic scholarly, inspiring, academic speeches I heard during commencement week at Brown and I'm sitting there on the chair, and I'm saying, you know, I can't sit here another summer (laughter) and, and do nothing but sit on this chair.  I gotta do something.  So I started scuffling around town, and lo and behold was so lucky through a couple of my family friends, I guess.  They had just opened E.H. Crump Hospital [Memphis, Tennessee], which was a brand new hospital for black people in Memphis and, and they--because I was a pre-med student and, and got accepted to medical school, whoever the powers to be were gave me a job and it was a fantastic job.  It was working as a scrub nurse in the operating room, passing instruments.  I mean, it just couldn't have been any better, you know?  And so I took the job with great enthusiasm and it was on-the-job training, you know?  And the nurse [Ophelia Rice] who trained me or was--her--among other things, her--she was best known and her claim to fame was that she was dating Elvis [Elvis Presley] from time to time, whatever that means.  Anyway, she taught me well and, and then I kind of started working--I still wanted to be a psychiatrist, but I, I looked around and the--it was--obviously, the action was in surgery and I was excited about that.  Not only that, the surgeons that seemed to be having the most fun seemed to be the orthopedic surgeons.  You know, they seemed to enjoy their work so much and I was watching them.  And, of course, the surgeons were from Campbell's clinic [Campbell Clinic Orthopaedics, Memphis, Tennessee] which is one of the most outstanding orthopedic clinics in the world, happens to be in Memphis, and so these were fantastic guys coming through, a few of 'em household names, a few of 'em I even got to know later, you know, through the back door or through the front door or whatever as, as professional colleagues, but at that time, they were guys that I was helping in the operating room.  But be--that--that's another thing.  But anyway, so--but still, surgery and, and--it was a secondary interest.  I still wanted to be a psychiatrist.  And I thought part of my reason was that I thought being, being black as it is, I was gonna be able to help black people a whole lot more.  So I ended up--got to Stanford and my heroes in anatomy lab, loved anatomy, my heroes, one had been a surgeon and--so again, surgery is growing, and psychiatry is always still what I wanted to do.  I couldn't wait to have a psychiatry patient.  I finally got on a psychiatry clerkship and I was gonna be assigned my first patient.  And I listened, and listened, and thought and thought, and I couldn't wait to get to the patient.  So I finally got to the patient.  It was an African American woman who was schizophrenic.  And I was supposed to--I met her, you know, in the institution on a--sat on this park bench, and I just couldn't wait to get there and save this lady and make her sane and so forth.  And so I jumped in with all my enthusiasm and naivety, and trying to talk to her and trying to do one thing, and just got nowhere, you know.  I mean, I could've been--you know, being black didn't mean anything.  In fact, being, you know, a student, nothing meant anything anyway.  So that changed my perspective a lot.  Interestingly, though, sh--very shortly after this, we went into an era where it was almost like only black psychiatrists could treat black patients, and every--there was this very distinct coupling of the two, but that hadn't occurred yet.  This would be in 1960, '60 [1960], '59 [1959], '60 [1960], in that era.  Anyway, so my--and then as my interests continued to wane in psychiatry and I thought about all the other--all the anatomy and biochemistry and all these things I was learning and I wasn't gonna be using it, that I probably would go ahead toward surgery.  And then, then, as I said, the heroes that I saw for me were surgeons, and then particularly orthopedics.  So that was--that was the way I evolved.  Dr. Don King, Dr. Richards [Victor Richards] was the general surgeon who inspired me tremendously and then Dr. King, and then a neurosurgeon, Dr. Hanbury [John Hanbury] were just--and they--as I said, it was a small school, so they really took personal interest in the students, so that's the way that changed, yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm
Story_ID: 307812
Speaker 1: So you finished medical school at Stanford [Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California].  Did the internship come next?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Or what came next?
Speaker 2: I went directly to University of Michigan [University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor, Michigan] where I believe I was the--I think I was the first black house staff there, but it was a great medical center, fantastic medical center.
Speaker 1: It was the University of Michigan--
Speaker 2: Ann Arbor.
Speaker 1: --Medical Center?
Speaker 2: University of Michigan, which is in Ann Arbor [Michigan].  The, the medical center is--
Speaker 1: Okay, that was--
Speaker 2: The University Hospitals they're called.
Speaker 1: And that's where you went for intern, okay.
Speaker 2: That's where I did a--did an internship, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  In Ann Arbor?
Speaker 2: In Ann Arbor, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  And, you know, internship, you're in the hospital twenty-four-seven one way or another.  If not, you're sleeping somewhere.  But, it was--it was--it's a great, great medical center, no question about it.  I enjoyed it.  I had exposure to the great George Zitomer [ph.] who at that time was a young attending, very young attending, and, and I had excellent junior resident, who was sort of your immediate supervisor and--David Kline who went on to be a outstanding neurosurgeon, but he was--I was lucky to have him.  He was a great teacher and, you know, really was able to get me on the right track and be a good role model and direct me appropriately, and teach me specifically, so I, I got a lot, lot from that.
Speaker 1: How long did the internship last?
Speaker 2: One year.  I was there for one year, yeah.
Story_ID: 307813
Speaker 1: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And what came next?
Speaker 1: And then I left there [University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor, Michigan] and went back to San Francisco [California] to continue my enthusiasm for Dr. King [Don King] and Dr. Richards [Victor Richards].  I did a year of general surgery in that program and Dr. Richards was the general surgeon and Dr. Don King was the orthopedic surgeon.  Again, I worked with Dr. Hanbury [John Hanbury] also.  And they were just, again, terrific role models, very inspirational.
Speaker 2: Was this a continuation of internship or was this now residency?
Speaker 1: Well, it's one year of--residency.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: One year of general surgery residency.  That was the way it was done at that time.  And I--and I went to Presbyterian medical center [Presbyterian Hospital; California Pacific Medical Center] in San Francisco where the professors who didn't want to move to Palo Alto [California] who had their practices and couldn't--didn't--couldn't move in a sense, stayed there and Presbyterian medical center became--the old Stanford Hospital in San Francisco became Presbyterian medical center, and that's where these surgeons were and that's where I worked as a house officer as a resident with them.
Story_ID: 307814
Speaker 1: And what came next?
Speaker 2: Next, I had the good fortune of going to Yale [Yale New Haven Hospital, New Haven, Connecticut] to be an orthopedic resident under Dr. Wayne Southwick, who was my sort of--I was fortunate in having a number of mentors over the years and of many different types, and he was my primary orthopedic mentor and career mentor, you know.  To this day, he's, he's, he's sort of like an uncle or father to many--most of his residents really.  He's, he's a phenomenal leader and, and mentor in that regard.  And, happily, I was able to be a part of, of that--one of his mentees as it were.
Speaker 1: And you were the first African American surgical resident at Yale?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Is that true also?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: And that was what, how many years?  Was that a year?
Speaker 2: I started in 1963 and I finished in 1966, three years of orthopedic residency there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What extracurricular activities did you have during internship/residency years?  I mean you--I know you have a lot of interests, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --what else were you doing?
Speaker 2: Well, the thing that I picked up and really got into and enjoyed immensely for a number of years was tennis.  Really, that, that was my, my joy.  I--the other thing, I guess, would be jazz.  I had the good fortune of, of a friend that I met, came to know when I was at Brown [Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island] who had box seats at the Newport Jazz Festival every year, and so I, I, I got to do that, and then I, I enjoyed jazz from, from the time I was in, in the eighth grade or whatever in, in Manassas [Manassas High School, Memphis, Tennessee].  But over the years, you know, when I was living in San Francisco [California], I would get a chance to do that.  So I would say tennis and jazz probably are my--that's probably it, my hobbies, yeah.
Story_ID: 307815
Speaker 1: Once you completed that surgical residency at Yale New Haven Hospital [New Haven, Connecticut], what came next?
Speaker 2: Well, I had the pleasure of, interesting sabbatical and experience with Uncle Sam in the--in the U.S. Army Medical Corps.  And, you know, two and a half weeks--I finished my residency, went to Fort Sam Houston [San Antonio, Texas], and two and a half weeks later, I was in Saigon [Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam] in a little tent, in a little bunk waiting to be deployed to my assignment.  And that was the beginning of the most unique and possibly the most influential year of my life.
Speaker 1: Did you do surgery?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  I--a ton of it.  One year--I worked in what would be a MASH [Mobile Army Surgical Hospital] Hospital, which means you get acute injuries right out of the field, right off the helicopter, and it also served as an evacuation hospital, which means that we would take care of the patients, stabilize them, get 'em ready, and ship 'em to the Philippines.  And it was an experience.  I mean, I--you, you can't--it's hard to talk about it in, in, in a--in a succinct manner.  I'm, I'm quite comfortable talking about it, but it's hard to condense it.  So I, I don't know what, what parts of it to share with you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How did you feel about the Vietnam War?
Speaker 2: Well, I was--I made a choice, first of all, to not try and get out of it, I didn't say to get out of it 'cause there's no way you know whether you get out of it, but I decided not to try to get out of it.  And the reasons are, are a little bit weird, but they're real.  It had to do with two things.  First of all, I knew that I would be going there not to kill people, but to try to save people and help people as much as I could.  And I was like a race horse, you know, trained in, in the gates ready to go in the sense that I had this fantastic, I thought, educational experience of three years of orthopedic residency, and I wanted to go out and do orthopedics, you know, and I thought, my goodness, what better place and where would it be more needed.  And the other one may sound a little corny, but it's real.  I thought about the fact that one way or another, during the Second World War [World War II, WWII], people who contributed, I, I benefited from that.  And I, I, I felt like, you know, payback.  I'm, I'm willing to, to go do what I can in this situation to help.  In terms of the--you know, did I--would I support the war or not support the war?  I, I--I'd go back and forth, mostly non-support, back and forth, back and forth.  So when I got to Vietnam and answered that question, I read, I talked to the troopers, you know, out of the combat field, I read, I talked and read, I listened and observed.  And, again, I went back and forth a little bit.  This is crazy, we're against, we're crazy.  About halfway through the year, it got more and more clear to me that this is not a good decision; it's not the right decision.  We're making a terrible mistake.  We don't understand what's going on.  At least, we're not--we don't seem to be understanding what, what the game really is.  Our hospital among other things took care of Viet Cong prisoners who were wounded.  So I got a chance to talk to some of them.  Now, most did not speak English and I didn't speak Vietnamese, but some spoke English.  And I got a chance to hear firsthand, you know, when they're getting better.  You're, you're taking care of 'em, you sit down and you talk to them.  And so that was kind of a corroboration of opinions that you read and, and all.  And basically, you know, I mean, I don't know how much we need to get in the discussion, but basically the Viet Cong were people who, their circumstances were such that they couldn't be pushed down.  They couldn't be any lower in terms of their quality of life.  And whatever they did, they couldn't go any farther down; they could only go up.  And what motivated them was what they viewed as a chance to go up or a chance to resist what they saw as unnecessary oppression, aggression, and they were fighting for their country, for their political ideologies as the case may be.  And it was--it was a no-brainer for them.  And they were well-equipped.  They were--they were clever and it made sense to them, you know?  They didn't view it in the paradigm of them being Communist puppets or anything else.  They view it as fighting primarily nationalism for their country, secondarily for what they believed in, what they thought was the way they wanted to live what their life was.  And then I looked at the strategies and I read as I said lots of books, talked to people.  It turns out, my commanding officer, I was very lucky--I'm very, very lucky in many ways, but there's a fellow named John Fagan, and we're friends to this day.  He was the first West Point [United States Military Academy, West Point, New York] graduate they ever let go to medical school, and he's kind of a pivotal guy and he's a big hero.  I mean, they got five or six hundred doctors now going to West Point.  But, anyway, John was my friend, advisor, mentor.  He also happened to be an orthopedic surgeon.  He was the CEO of the hospital and we, we worked together.  So I had a chance to bounce a lot.  So, so anyway, I ended up not supporting the war politically at all--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: --and thinking it was a mistake and the wrong thing to do.
Story_ID: 307816
Speaker 1: Part of your time [during the Vietnam War], you were working in a leper colony?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Were you assigned to that or was that by choice (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was by choice, yeah.
Speaker 1: Say a little--
Speaker 2: Not assigned at all.
Speaker 1: Say a little bit about how you had that choice--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --and what that was like.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, it's something--it was in some ways luck.  I mean, I inherited it in a sense.  When I came in and got settled, my first commanding officer was a guy named Tony Ballard who was an orthopedic surgeon who was a CEO of the hospital.  And so I showed up and, "Reporting, sir," and here I am, let's--yeah.  So in the course of doing my work, Tony Ballard said, hey, you know, I've been going out a couple of times--there's, there's a leper colony over the hill out here and, you know, when you're not busy, maybe you may wanna go out there and see what they're doing and see what's going on, and maybe you can help them, you know.  And I--you know, he, he was interested in hand surgery, he said--and a lot of lepers need surgery on their hands and so forth.  And so he said, I'll go out with you a couple--why don't we go out?  So, you know, there were times when we had a little free time, things were not busy, and there was other coverage also, and so we went out.  He was in a non--he said--he said it's in a--not in a secure area, but nobody's bothered so far (laughter).  So anyway, I went out and I looked at it, and the, the nuns were all excited and so happy, hoping they'd have some help.  And, and it's a fantastic place, beautiful place.  Anyway, it was a tremendous need.  The nuns were there, they wanted to work, they wanted to help, and, so I, I, I said, yeah, this looks like something we could do.  And then we looked around and there--a lot of people volunteered, you know.  We--the, the two of--John Fagan and myself, primarily me because John had to run the hospital, were kind of the ongoing core element the whole year that I was there, but a lot of people helped.  You know, anesthesiologists came out and helped us as we needed it, nurses--there was one nurse, Major Pinkowski [ph.] who was always with us.  She'd prepare whatever.  We tell her what surgeries we need, she'd actually sterilize the instruments, the, the, some of the, the, the corpsmen [in the U.S. Army Medical Corps] would load it up and they would help us.  And we got pretty--and they fixed up an operating room.  They got some generators--the [U.S.] military gave 'em some generators so we had lights.  And we, we, we were--I, I wish--I mean, I had pictures, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna present this at Brown [Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island] Monday, actually.  I'm gonna put some slides together.
Story_ID: 307817
Speaker 1: You know, we worked hard out there [in the leper colony in Vietnam] for a year and, and as I said, with a lot of help, a lot of other volunteers, and I think we provided a lot of service, did a lot of procedures and care.  But in the bottom line, the final analysis, I really wonder who got helped more, the helpers or the helpees.  And, and, and just as an example, the very last day, we told the, the--of course, the sisters that I, I was leaving the country, I finished my tour of duty and so forth, and we went around and, and made rounds on the wards, and then the sister says, "Well, we'd like you to come down over in this particular area and just have a seat."  So I sat down and they said, "Just relax."  And, and then people started coming from all different exits of, of the, the, the hallway and the different rooms and the different corridors.  And some of them were on crutches and by the time they all got together, it was maybe thirty people there.  And they were all patients who were in various stages of recovery that we had operated during the period of time.  And then one of the patients and one of the people who lived in the colony kinda walked down in the front.  And, and very kind of broken English but clearly said, "We want to thank you and your group, and Dr. White [HistoryMaker Dr. Augustus A. White III], we want to thank you.  And, and we, we want you to know we think you are a good"--and, and he was--he was groping for words.  He couldn't quite--he wanted to compliment me.  He wanted to say something good about me, but he couldn't quite get the words and he wasn't quite getting it there.  And finally, he said, "You, Muhammad Ali," and that was his way of trying to thank me, and I'll never forget that.  I, I mean, it just blew me away (laughter).
Speaker 2: Isn't that something?  Yeah.
Speaker 1: And I'm a--besides, I'm a great admirer (laughter) of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, of Muhammad--
Speaker 1: --of his anyway, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but he didn't know that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But, but it--somehow that was his way.  You know, he knew I was American, he knew I was--but, he, he, he couldn't--
Speaker 2: That's fascinating.
Speaker 1: But it, it, it just said so much about Muhammad Ali--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and just the whole communications, but, but just--
Speaker 2: That's how--that's how great you--
Speaker 1: --an expression of appreciation (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's how great you were.
Speaker 1: --that I just never had--
Speaker 2: That's how great you were.
Speaker 1: Well--but, I mean--
Speaker 2: Muhammad was the greatest--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --and you were the greatest.
Speaker 1: But I'll, I'll never forget that.  But he was--
Speaker 2: That's fantastic.

Speaker 1: You were--finished your [U.S.] military service, what year?  When were you discharged?
Speaker 2: I finished--well, I had finished that year, then I came back--that would've been '67 [1967] in Vietnam and then I did a year in, in Monterey, California [Monterey County, California], Fort Ord Army Hospital, and so I was there until '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I finished my two years with Uncle Sam in 1968.
Speaker 1: You received a Bronze Star [Bronze Star Medal]--
Speaker 2: I did, yes.
Speaker 1: --for--
Speaker 2: Well, I think it was a combination of my work in the leper colony, which interestingly, the military viewed it--I mean, not just in this way.  I mean, obviously, from a humanitarian point of view, but, but the official military take on that was that this was a counter insurgency.  In other words, the good will of what, in my military uniform and with military equipment and personnel what we were doing to help these patients, which indeed we were doing, was good will.  And part of the military strategy when you're fighting an insurgency is to not just shoot at the people, but, but try to get the population to think you're a good guy and you're doing some good.  So in the context of that, the humanitarian part, but really, frankly, more important the counter insurgency part of it, that was a major contribution as the military saw it.  The other part of that is, the other part of my I guess the, the Bronze Star, was I, I went--they called into the hospital one day and they said, "We have a trooper up on the mountainside out here and that was outside the compound, outside the secure area, and he needs some medical support to get him down off the mountainside.  He needs to be evaluated and prepared in a way that we can get him down, and, you know, we want some volunteers to do it, and preferably we'd like you to be a doctor."  So I guess I was in a good mood or feeling strong or stupid or whatever, but I thought, okay, I think I can--I, I can do that.  And I knew something--being an orthopedist, I knew something about how to splint people, you know, and, and, and they thought it was either a dislocated hip or fractured hip.  And so I said, okay, you know.  So I, I, I--the troopers got me and the, the--they got the radio contact or whatever, put me in a Jeep and took me out, you know, to the bottom of the mountain and said, "Okay, Doc, go that way."  So I, I ran over to the first guy, you know, and he said, okay, Doc, come on.  And he ran up the mountainside and I'm running behind him, and he went up, I don't know how far, let's say seventy-five or a hundred yards, and there was another trooper there, and this trooper stopped and said, "Okay, come on, Doc" (laughter).  So I was like a baton (laughter).
Speaker 1: Like a relay race.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  So there were about three or four of these guys.  Finally, I got up to where the person was and, and was able to help to splint him and, and, and they did have a stretcher they--there.  And, and it--you know, I--this brings up a--an aside.  But the real heroes in Vietnam were the nurses and the helicopter pilots, and they were phenomenal.  Anyway, the, the guy had to bring the helicopter in on the side of the mountain.  He couldn't land it, but he had to bring it in.  The mountain comes down this way, here I am with the splinted, got the guy settled down and splinted, and ready to be evacuated off the mountain.  The helicopter had to come in, it couldn't land because of the slope, so it just had to hover.  And then what we had to do was to take the guy (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Lift him.
Speaker 2: --and put him up into the helicopter.  So we, we were able to do all that, but as, as the helicopter was hovering, I looked over the side of the mountain, and I could see the blade was about only a foot and a half from the side of the mountain, you know?  And this is how good these guys were.  I mean, he, he, he came in there and did that, we got the fellow on, and it was--it was a successful evacuation and so forth.  So that was part of, of, of that volunteer effort that, that was--that was recognized, and that's what that was.
Story_ID: 307819
Speaker 1: What came next in your--in your life and career?
Speaker 2: Well, again, thanks to my mentor, Wayne Southwick that we talked about, he had applied, submitted my record and work as a resident and so forth and, and resources at Yale [Yale New Haven Hospital, New Haven Connecticut] and the, the goals of Yale to have the NIH [National Institutes of Health] support me on a fellowship to go to Sweden to, to study orthopedic biomechanics.  And it turns out that the, the premier professor in the world at that time in orthopedic biomechanics was a fellow named Carl Hirsch, Professor Carl Hirsch, at University of Gothenburg [Gothenburg, Sweden], in, in Sweden.  And Professor Hirsch was doing a lot of superb research wherein he was looking at mechanical scientific analyses of orthopedic related items, in this case the spine.  So I, I went to do research there and it was a wonderful experience.  I mean, Professor Hirsch was not just an outstanding scholar and, and, and leader, and director and mentor for research, but he, he was--he took an interest in me and was very kind and helpful to me during the time I was there.
Speaker 1: Would you spell his last name for the record?
Speaker 2: H-I-R-C-H.  C-A-R-L, H-I-R-C-H [sic.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he's a well-known professor in, in, in Sweden.
Speaker 1: Very quickly, what was the nature of your research?  Getting down to it.
Speaker 2: It was analysis of the mechanics of the thoracic spine in man, and the thoracic spine, as you know, is the part of the spine that goes from the lower neck to the mid back, and that's the part where the ribs are connected.  And that's the part where scoliosis, curvature of the spine, most frequently begins and most frequently exists.  It can exist in other parts of the spine also.  And what we did was using, using electronic displacement gauges, we took a number of thoracic spine specimens and segmented them in two vertebrae at the time and studied very carefully the complete scientific motion, precise quantitative motion of the spine as it moves in the natural way so that we can understand fully, both for the purposes of understanding scoliosis.  Where it goes wrong, it gets askew and its--becomes a deformity.  And other diseases of the spine, trauma, fractures, tumors, surgical changes, but primarily the scoliosis was the major reason for studying this.  And it had not been described before in a precise quantitative manner, and my job with the help of the resources of this laboratory and Professor Hirsch's guidance and, and, and all was to, to do this analysis.  And it ended up, we, we published it as a separate supplement to Acta Orthopaedica Scandinavica [Acta Orthopaedica].  And then one has in Sweden, in order to get one's degree, disputation the same way, defense we call in the U.S., the same way we do in the U.S. except there, it's, it's, it's more formally structured and it's called a disputation, and they have three professors to oppose you.  And you dress up in black tie and, and white formal attire with tails.
Speaker 1: Do you have a--you have a picture to show us of that, don't you?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And, and then the three professors go after you for as long as they like.  And you have to nail your thesis up on the wall of the auditorium two weeks before this happens so that when the professors finish, anyone in the audience can challenge you and you have to rigorously challenge this, and that's the Swedish tradition of disputation.
Speaker 1: Did you mention the institution that you did this research at?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It--it's--it was--it's University of Gothenburg--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --in, in Gothenburg, Sweden.  Now, Professor Hirsch moved from Gothenburg to Karolinska [Karolinska Institutet, Solna, Sweden] in Stockholm [sic.] just as I was finishing my thesis, so I actually went to Stockholm [Sweden] for my disputation.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: So my degree actually comes from Stockholm University, Karolinska, rather than from Gothenburg.
Speaker 1: That was a year program?  A year research or more?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a year and a half.  I was working full-time during, during that period to, to get that completed.
Story_ID: 307820
Speaker 1: Now, you met another very special person there.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes, yes.  There was a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tell us about that.
Speaker 2: --a young student who was studying languages, German and other languages in school in University of Gothenburg [Gothenburg, Sweden].  And part of the system there allows students to be trained minimally to do certain procedures in the hospital that a nurse might do in our hospital, but it's very focused training and it's not professional nursing by any means, but it's doing blood pressures and, and other charting activities and so forth.  And there was a, a student there by the name of Anita [Anita White] that I had the pleasure of meeting and, and so I was sort of minding my own business roaming through the hospital and we met, and, and ended up spending our time together.  She came to the U.S. after some period of time and she's now the mother of my three daughters, and my wife.
Speaker 1: Good.  And when were you married?
Speaker 2: I was married in 1974, yeah.
Speaker 1: Where?
Speaker 2: In Madison, Connecticut, small town there.
Speaker 1: Why Madison?
Speaker 2: Madison.  Well, I was living in Madison--
Speaker 1: Oh, you were?
Speaker 2: --and I was--I, I came back--after Sweden, I was on the faculty at Yale medical school [Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut] so I was commuting from Madison to New Haven [Connecticut] and, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --working in the orthopedic department.
Speaker 1: I didn't know you--
Speaker 2: Working under my mentor [Wayne Southwick], actually.
Story_ID: 307821
Speaker 1: I didn't know you went back to Yale [Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That wasn't--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in your record.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I went, went from, from Sweden, came back to Yale and started, had--part of my mission, Dr. Southwick [Wayne Southwick], was for me to come back and start an orthopedic biomechanics laboratory at Yale and had the good fortune of being able to do that.  And that lab is still ongoing.  A, a very good friend of mine named Dr. Manohar Panjabi was in Sweden at the time that I was finishing my thesis there, and he consulted with me, helped me complete my thesis in terms of his engineering; he's an engineer.  And I was able to find some funds when I got back to Yale, and I went back to Sweden to ask him if he would come and move his family and come and, and work with me at Yale, and I wanted--told him we wanted to get some biomechanics research going.  And he had the courage to come.  I said, we have no guarantee but more than one year salary, but we'll work like mad to get some grants and try to get things started, and with the help of some people at Yale, the Sadler twins [Blair Sadler and Alfred Sadler] who were able to give us a little seed money, and Dr. Southwick, we were able to get the lab started, and we worked together there for many years, and we did the textbook together, the 'Clinical Biomechanics of the Spine' [Augustus A. White III and Manohar M. Panjabi].  And so that lab is ongoing and Dr. Panjabi is a continued friend and colleague and collaborator.
Speaker 1: And would you spell his name for--
Speaker 2: P-A-N-J-A-B-I and Manohar is the first name, M-A-N-O-H-A-R.
Speaker 1: So this 'Clinical Biomechanics of the Spine,' that was published when?
Speaker 2: Well, the first edition was published in 1978, I believe, and the second edition was in 1990.  And we're working now on the third edition.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was a book that we dedicated--Dr. Panjabi is Indian and we are both admirers, both of us both admire Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and both admire Mahatma Gandhi, so we ended up dedicating the book to them and to our respective families.  But that was a, a, a really nice synergy and felt, felt good to be able to, to do that.
Story_ID: 307822
Speaker 1: Where did you go to next?  What was the next step?
Speaker 2: Well, after--at, at Yale [Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut], I was invited to, to look at a job here in Boston [Massachusetts] and ended up being recruited to start the first academic department of orthopedic surgery at Beth Israel Medical Center [Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts] and at Harvard Medical School [Boston, Massachusetts].  Wouldn't be the first department at Harvard Medical School, but it'd be the first department of Beth Israel.  And it was part of the Harvard Medical School combined orthopedic department, and also with a mission to--well, I--it sort of was my own mission, but to start another laboratory this time in collaboration with Dr. Wilson Hayes, we started the orthopedic biomechanics laboratory at Beth Israel Hospital, which is still operative and ongoing.  And, and so, so that was my job.  I served as chief of orthopedics at Beth Israel and as a spine surgeon, working here in the greater Boston area and at, at Harvard Medical School as a--as a professor.
Speaker 1: Did you have a private practice or were your patients seen through the hospital?
Speaker 2: Well, I saw all of my patients in the hospital, but it was essentially a private practice, year.  I mean, I saw patients just as, as if I were not in the hospital, but I, I was--had the other responsibilities, administrative and educational and research responsibilities.
Speaker 1: When and how did your affiliation with Harvard Medical School begin then?  'Cause you came as--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --at, at BI [Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts] first, right?
Speaker 2: Well, it was combined.
Speaker 1: Oh, it was combined.
Speaker 2: The appointment was initially all combined.  The, the Harvard Medical School part that I described now where I sort of shifted--I, I--when I was at BI, I was working--the whole time I've been here working for both Beth Israel and Harvard, but my activities then were clinical and hospital related at the Beth Israel, but I was still at that time professor of orthopedic surgery, but the difference and I, I think the reason you ask me that now that I'm no longer doing clinical practice, I'm working only in the area of education and related activities, the consulting (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --activities that we--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --spoke about.
Story_ID: 307823
Speaker 1: I'm interested, as you know, in, in publications and books and so on as a writer.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell me about 'Your Aching Back:  A Doctor's Guide to Relief' [Dr. Augustus A. White III, M.D.].  That's been a pretty popular book, has it?
Speaker 2: I think it has.  It's, it's, it's done well.  It's--it has for me a couple of interesting origins.  One of my good friends from college [Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island] named Barry Merkin who's been sort of a peer, friend, and mentor for a number of years in a--in a number of ways, has been a very successful businessman, is now in academics.  In fact, he was the first clinical professor in, in the business world, and that is the idea--in, in medicine, we have what we call clinical professors, which means that you, you become a professor not necessarily through traditional academic routes, i.e. research and writing, but you become a professor based on extensive clinical expertise and experience and then you move in that way.  Well, relatively new in the business world, there's the traditional academic track, but very new, and I believe Barry may have been the first.  I know he's the first at Kellogg Business School [Kellogg School of Management, Evanston, Illinois] in Chicago [sic.] where he had done so much work in the publishing business and then subsequently in the manufacturing business; he'd been an outstanding CEO for a company named Dresher [Dresher Inc., Bedford Park, Illinois].  So the dean at, at Northeastern--Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois], rather, brought him in as a clinical professor.  Anyway, Barry was in the publishing business and we were talking at one of our early reunions at Brown [Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island].  And he said--he had had some trouble with his back and we talked a little bit, and he said, "Have you ever thought about writing a book about back pain for lay people?"  I said, "No."  He said, "Well, you know, I'm, I'm listening to you and I know what questions need to be answered" and so forth.  Anyway, he said, "Why don't you think about that," so I did.  And I started actually dictating when I was coming home from work, which is not a particularly good idea and I don't recommend it, but I did it.  I don't do that anymore, but nevertheless, I started dictating answers that I had given to patients.  And what I realized was that back pain is so complex even for those who deal with it from a clinical point of view, that patients are very confused and, and just explaining things to them helps them a lot because at, at least you get rid of the anxiety component of what's bothering them, they feel a little more confident when they understand things.  So I started kind of giving my answers in, in the dictaphone.  And, and the book is designed just that way, to be patient accommodating, patient friendly, patient comforting, and educating, of course.  And so we began to sort of put the whole thing together, but that's the origin of that.  And, and I've sort of enjoyed doing that and it's been--it's been fun.  I try to include a little humor and try to make it as interesting as possible (laughter) to read.  So that's, that's the story on that book.
Speaker 1: Well, some years ago I thought I was gonna need a copy of this but somehow my back straightened up (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I'm glad--I'm glad you don't.
Speaker 1: But is your book still in print?  Is that--
Speaker 2: It is still in print.
Speaker 1: It is still in print?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And actually, that one we're committed to, to do a revision on also.
Speaker 1: Who's the publisher?
Speaker 2: The publisher--the first publisher was Bantam [Bantam Books, New York, New York].  The current publisher is Simon and Schuster [New York, New York], and it is still in print and still available.
Story_ID: 307824
Speaker 1: You have several other books, 'Back Care' [Augustus A. White III] is that similar to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's a--
Speaker 1: Is that a popular book?
Speaker 2: --a much smaller iteration of 'Your Aching Back: A Doctor's Guide to Relief' [Dr. Augustus A. White III, M.D.].  Yeah.
Speaker 1: And tell me about your other books.  You have 'Biomechanics in the Musculoskeletal System' [Augustus A. White III and Manohar M. Panjabi].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, that's, that's--
Speaker 2: That's done with Dr. Panjabi [Manohar Panjabi].
Speaker 1: --done with Panjabi also.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And that book is, is an attempt to be educational.  What it does is it describes a number--one of the things that, that we sort of were involved with, Dr. Panjabi and I on this back book, 'Clinical Biomechanics of the Spine' [Augustus A. White III and Manohar M. Panjabi] was sort of bringing two disciplines together, clinical orthopedics and mechanical engineering.  And really, orthopedics in a sense is the clinical science of recognizing, understanding disruptions of the biomechanics, the mechanical functions of our body and fixing it.  And our body really is--at some level, it's a machine, you know, it's, it's very mechanical.  So that was that book.  But there are many engineering terms and concepts that are important to be understood by orthopedic surgeons, by physical therapists, by scientists who are doing clinical research in orthopedics, and what we wanted to do in this particular book is to bring those terms in a way to the reader so that they could use them effectively and easily.  So we take the key concepts and we explain it in kind of a, a lay orthopedic narrative way, and then we explain it in a, a more sophisticated way, and then we explain it in a mathematical way.  So you have three levels of sophistication with diagrams and analyses, and it's all geared to be pedagogically useful.  It's, it's not an attempt to do anything else.  And Dr. Panjabi and I worked together to, to do that--to do that book.  There's another book called the--called 'Idiopathic Low Back Pain[: Symposium Proceedings]' which is something that we edited.  I worked with a fellow named Steve Gordon [Stephen Gordon] who's a scientist at NIH [National Institutes of Health], and this was a result of a, a, a symposium, international symposium on low pack--low back pain that we did back in the '70s [sic. 1982].  And that was bringing all of the major fields, the neurologists, the neurosurgeon, the orthopedic surgeon, the bioengineer, the, the former colleges, and bringing all of these different aspects, the surgical indications, surgical techniques, the pain specialists, the, the socioeconomics of back pain and to sort of bring them together to try to improve clinical understanding at a scientific--in a scientific way--in an evidence based way on low back pain, so that was what that, that book was about.
Story_ID: 307825
Speaker 1: Dr. White, [HistoryMaker Dr. Augustus A. White III] is there anything that you'd like to add to this interview conversation that I haven't asked you about?
Speaker 2: Well, I think we talked a little bit about the, the value of, of diversity in, in, in our society and, and in the world.  And I think it's, it's worth mentioning that the world is, is much more global due to improved communications and due to increased economic interdependence and environmental interdependence, and there's a great need I feel to--for people to understand one another and appreciate one another, and be able to communicate with one another for so many reasons.  And, and I think the concept of diversity in a way begins to encompass that.  It begins to say that, that we must learn to respect and understand ways in which we are different and to respect and understand and exploit the ways in which we are the same.  And I, I feel that, that this is an opportune time to do this, and I think that in, in the context of medicine where we have different cultures, a, a doctor may be a Caucasian male doctor and may be relating to a, a, a lesbian Latina woman and, and these are two degrees of difference of cultures.  And without any insight, understanding, concern, empathy or knowledge, this doctor may express conscious or unconscious bias and may provide inferior care to that individual, or it could be two scientists trying to work together, or it could be attorney and his client.  It could be--or it could be someone in a diplomatic relationship or in a business deal.  I think diversity begins to look for and address structures in which that communication can be maximized and the most good can come out of it, and the least amount of misunderstanding or missed opportunities can, can be taken out of that or can be--can be achieved.  So I guess I don't--I guess I just would encourage all of us in whatever sea of influence we have to utilize our influence and to try to think positively and constructively and collaboratively across our differences, and there are plenty of differences, and there's plenty of wasted opportunities if, if we don't manage those differences in the best possible way.
Speaker 1: Do you want to say anything more about healthcare disparities and the work that you've done in that area or any of your concerns?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that it's something that is gradually coming to be recognized more and more as something that we need to allocate some resources to addressing, and I hope that will happen and, again, I hope that people who can impact on that will do so.  But there are quite a few groups of people.  I mean, I--women, there's a start, and that includes our mothers and our sisters and our daughters and our friends as it were, elderly people, Native Americans, African American, Asian Americans, Latino people, disabled people, poor people, obese people, gays, lesbians and bisexuals, prisoners, certain immigrant groups, all of these groups of people experience health disparities because in part of conscious and unconscious bias or lack of training to attend to appropriately addressing whatever differences of perspective may be existent.  So I, I, I think that it's important that we all work on this, particularly those in medical education and those in medicine.  But I think those who have resources and who have political influence and who have other opportunities to address this, I would encourage to do so because it--it's not--it's not an easy task to change.  It's hard to change behavior.  We don't have a lot of faculty members who have had the experience and the knowledge and the ability to teach this, so that's one of the things that has to be done before we can really do it very well, so I think it's an important area.
Story_ID: 307826
Speaker 1: Dr. White [HistoryMaker Dr. Augustus A. White III] how do you feel about the way that you have lived your life so far?
Speaker 2: Well, I think we talked a little earlier that I'm in the middle of a move and attempting to organize and get rid of things I don't need to keep.  And in that process, I've been--since been living--reliving my life, actually.  And I'm--I feel happy and, and very fortunate.  I, I feel--I really do.  I think it's been--it's been a happy and gratifying life.  And I really have no complaints.  I've, I've, I've--it's, it's been a joy.  I--it really has.  You know, it, it--it's been a lot of hard work, but I, I guess I like hard work, so that's, that's not a problem.  So, yes, I, I, I guess it's been a joy, it's been a privilege, and I'm very grateful and, and appreciative of, of, of the, the experiences that I've been able to have and, and the good fortune that I've been able to have, and, and the good people that I've been able to encounter.
Speaker 1: Is there anything you've done that you might have done differently along the way?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so.  I mean, I, I, I certainly will say that, you know, there are--there are some missed opportunities, things that I, I might've accepted or, or done that I, I for some reason didn't do and I don't know what would've happened if I had and if, if things would've been a lot better if I'd done it.  There are a few of those along the way, and--but I don't have regrets about it because the--I don't know what would've happened if I'd gone down one fork of the road, but the fork that I took is okay.  And it is possible, though, that the other fork somehow could've been better, but it also could've been worse.  So, I don't agonize over it, but yes, there are a few of those, sure.
Story_ID: 307827
Speaker 1: What do you still wanna do that you have not yet done?
Speaker 2: Right now, I think I, I just wanna try to get some of these writing commitments completed and sort of relax and, and, and have fun.  I, I guess I have--I do aspire to sort of trying to write about some of my experiences, not to offer any great--I don't aspire to offer any great literary masterpiece, but just, just a narrative to, to, to put there for whatever constructive value it may have along the way.  I think I'd like to do that.  I, I don't know.  The schedule's kind of crowded.  I don't know if I'm gonna get there or not, but the answer to your question is, yes.  That's the answer to that question.
Story_ID: 307828
Speaker 1: Tell me about your three daughters, their names and what they're doing today.  And then, more importantly, how are they carrying on, I'm sure they are in some way, your values and, and your life and the things that you've been trying to do?  Tell us about that part of your family.
Speaker 2: Okay, well let's start with that last question, carrying on my values.  I have a daughter [Alissa White] who's working in Stockholm [Sweden], who lives in Stockholm.  I think I mentioned to you she was the first Swedish women's pole vaulting champion there and was the record holder there for several years.  She ended up having a couple of surgeries.  She had a fatigue fracture--
Speaker 1: A what fracture?
Speaker 2: A fatigue fracture.  It's a stress fracture, a fracture of her lower leg, and ended up having to have a couple of operations, and finally that healed, and she's back competing again, and she's ranked fourth or fifth in the country now, still enjoys doing it.  But she just got a very nice position with Cushman and Wakefield [New York, New York], which is a large commercial real estate company.  She did a, a, a master's degree, master of science in international business, international business--international economics and business from the Stockholm School of Economics [Stockholm, Sweden].  But I--she was here visiting and I--you know, I, I have kind of an agreement with my girls that--you know, that if--I realize they're not gonna do everything I tell 'em, but if they'll just listen, let me have my day in court and then make up their mind afterwards.  So I said, you know, you have this new position and so forth and I'd just like to run through a few do's and don'ts on your new job if, if you'll allow me to do that.  So I, I thought about it before meeting with her and written a few notes to myself and we were just having lunch together.  So anyway, I went through my list.  She waited very patiently; I went through my list.  And when I finished she said, "Well, dad, you've already told us all those things.  You've already taught us that." And it really made me feel, feel good (laughter).  And so that was fine.  So you asked me about what, what influence--
Story_ID: 307829
Speaker 1: But (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) How old is she, this daughter?
Speaker 1: She's thirty.
Speaker 2: And her name?
Speaker 1: Her name is Alissa, Alissa Alexandra White.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And so she loves Stockholm [Sweden].  She likes the U.S. also, but somehow when it's all sorted out, she likes her life in Sweden better.  I think as a--as a pole vaulter, the society and the way things work better support her and allow her to continue to compete much better than she'd ever be able to do in the U.S. just because of the way the system works.  You know, if, if, if you're a professional athlete, that's fine, the U.S. works fine.  But if you're a competitive athlete but you're not, you know, not getting paid for it, there--there's a club system and there's a system that, that supports you for your expenses, the training facilities, and all those kinds of things; that's a big part of it.  But she likes--she's fluent in Swedish and she likes the Swedish culture and so forth.  So that's most of what she's doing and she's happy and she enjoys it.  She went to Middlebury College [Middlebury, Vermont] and, and then to graduate school [Stockholm School of Economics] in Sweden.  So that's that daughter.  The middle daughter is Atina, Atina Andrea White, and she is currently in graduate school at Lesley University [Cambridge, Massachusetts], and her study, she's getting a master's degree in intercultural relations.  And it's kind of--the way I think of it is kind of the paradigm of international relations, but rather than focusing on the political, the economic and the geographical, that kind of approach, it's--and the historical, it's more related to the cultural aspects.  And she's not sure how she's gonna utilize that, but it's what interests her.  She looked around a lot of areas.  She spent some time on a, a, a leadership, fellowship program in Kenya.  I'm blocking on the name of it, but it's not Outward Bound but it's a--it may come to me, but she spent some time doing that and she spent some time sort of driving across the country and traveling.  And she's working part-time for Abt Associates in, in Boston [Massachusetts] now, but most of her time is, is graduate school.  It's, it's just a part-time position at Abt.  So, we'll see.  I'm not sure what her next activity will be, but she's--she went to Brown [Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island].  She was a graduate of Brown.  She majored in organizational behavior and management.  So that could be combined perhaps in a good way with intercultural relations or something like that.  So that's, that's her.  By the way, they, they--the, the first one that I described, Alissa, the older daughter is--besides pole vaulting, she was very active in soccer and other track events and, and still likes a lot of sports.  She does deep, deep, deep diving, deep sea diving and tennis and golf and so forth.  Atina is a skier.  They all ski but Atina is--likes skiing a lot.  And she's more interested in dance, though, than competitive athletics and she, she enjoys dancing but hasn't done it in any formal way.  And then the youngest is Annica [Annica White] who also is a pole vaulter and actually went to UVA [University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia] as a track scholarship there, majored in economics.  And I mentioned she worked for The Partnership, which is not-for-profit organization in Boston, sort of designed to improve diversity and race relations, improve Boston--help Boston improve its image in terms of diversity and race relations, and it has been very successful.  As you know, it's been--part of its mission is to capture and support and keep some of the diverse students who are educated in our one hundred plus colleges around and, and leave immediately, but to keep them in.  And Annica was in those--some of those programs and is actually working there and enjoys it very much, and embraces the mission of the partnership very nicely, and hopes to go on to graduate education at some point after a year or so more.
Speaker 2: Well, I see many reflections in their interests and their achievements and their ongoing activities in, in what you've done.
Speaker 1: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I can see the reflections, you know?
Speaker 1: Yeah it is there.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I don't know if that's good or bad.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean, certainly I--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I want them to have their own explorations but they, they seemed to have done it spontaneously, so hopefully it works for them.
Story_ID: 307830
Speaker 1: One last question, how do you want to be remembered?
Speaker 2: That's a--that's a tough one.  I didn't anticipate that one.  Well, I think as a guy who worked hard and tried to make a contribution who hopefully among that contribution, some, some expressions of, of, of good will that maybe helped some people besides patients, helped some other people in their journey in and around, well other African American people sort of navigate the system as it exists, navigate their, their life and hopefully I've been able to encourage some people along the way to do that and hope I've been a, a good parent, a good dad, a good, good husband.  Been willing to take some chances and, and, and try to meet some challenges, and basically hopefully had some joy, had some fun along the way.  I think--I think I would stop there in terms of remembrance, that's a lot to remember.  But I think one of the things, one of my philosophies is that I believe in working very, very hard but I also think that compatible with that and, and part of the mission ought to be to have some fun in the process, you know, in the process of work.  I think fun outside work is, is great also, but I think it's important to pay some time and attention to having fun doing the work.  So I, I guess that's--it's not very succinct but I guess, something like that.
Speaker 1: You said it.
Story_ID: 307831
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  And tell us about that.
Speaker 2: On the right is my grandmother, Ms. Lucy Dandridge [Lucy Van Pelt Dandridge], who was a, a very friendly lady.  She used to always say in order to make friends, you must first show yourself friendly.  And she'd sit on the front porch of her house and people would come by and speak pleasantries with her, and she was well liked.  And actually, she practiced a little bit of alternative medicine I learned in retrospect.  Sometimes she'd have some things to give people to make 'em feel better when they came by to see her.  So that was my grandmother.  She was substantially part Native American.  I don't know the exact history, but as you can see from her parents, she was.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: It's my grand aunt by marriage.  She's the mother of a very--my uncle, Doc Jones, by marriage, who was a, a, a great friend and mentor to me, and that's his mother, very nice lady.
Speaker 1: This is my dad [Augustus White, Jr.] and his mom.  Many years ago, I--it's hard to know.  It's probably while he was in medical school I would guess.  As we said, he went to Meharry medical school [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] and was a general practitioner.  And that's Ms. Lenora Goodman [Lenora Goodman White], my grandmother, and his mom.
Speaker 2: This looks--this looks like my mom [Vivian Dandridge White] and dad flirting together and they were probably either newly married or just before being married in that picture.
Speaker 1: The person on the left is my dad's father and I don't know who the person is on the right.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  His name?
Speaker 1: His name is Augustus A. White [Augustus White, Sr.].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: This is another picture of my grandmother that shows her at a earlier age I think than the previous one.
Speaker 2: This is our, our family prior to the youngest daughter being born.  We were still living in Connecticut at this time.  The--my wife, of course, on the right and on the left is Alissa [Alissa White], our oldest daughter and then Atina [Atina White], the middle daughter.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  And this was taken when approximately?
Speaker 2: This was taken probably in 1976 or '77 [1977], '76 [1976] I would say.
Speaker 1: This is during a, a, a delightful trip that the--we had with the whole family traveling in Europe in France.  And we've had some nice vacations together as family.  And we usually spend the summers together in Sweden, but this time we had an opportunity related to a medical meeting I think to travel in, in France for a period of time.
Speaker 2: This is our home in Memphis [Tennessee] where I grew up in my, my early childhood with my family, my dad who's knees I'm sitting between and my mom, of course, lived there and then my grandmother and a grand aunt.  But this is the front steps of our home in Memphis.
Speaker 1: Right in the very middle of this picture, I am occupying and this is, as you can see coming in, Camp Atwater [North Brookfield, Massachusetts], where I, I believe a number of our HistoryMakers have had a sojourn along the way.  It was a very nice experience to be there.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  What year was this?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  This is where?
Speaker 2: This would be in I think 1948 is, is the best guess for that.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  And where is Camp Atwater?
Speaker 2: Camp Atwater is in East Northfield, Massachusetts [sic.].  And it existed for many years.  I, I understand it's been revived but it was a season for girls and a season for boys and a nice camping experience.  It was right on a lake and you learned to swim and camp, and quite an experience.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Where are you in the picture?
Speaker 2: I'm right in the middle.  I can point to it.  Well, just so you know, right there in the stripe shirt.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: You see it?  The gentleman to my left is J.R.E. Lee, III.
Speaker 1: This is a yearbook picture from Northfield Mount Hermon [Mount Hermon School for Boys; Northfield Mount Hermon, Gill, Massachusetts] in 1952 and just during happy years as a senior getting ready to graduate.
Speaker 2: And this is at Northfield Mount Hermon right immediately after graduation, sort of came home and brought my cap and gown just to have a permanent picture of that graduation experience.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  All right.
Speaker 2: This is a, a, a PR [public relations] picture from my Brown [Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island] football career where I played offensive and defensive end over the course of my four years at Brown.  Actually, I was playing varsity just three of those four years and starting during the last year.  And a couple of highlights of my athletic career, one is had the privilege of receiving the class of 1910 trophy which is the senior letterman with the highest academic average on the team, and then I got a letter of invitation for--from the Chicago, Chicago Cardinals [Arizona Cardinals] to be invited to their camp to try out for their team.  I, I didn't accept that invitation.  I thought I'd do better to just stick with medicine.
Speaker 1: Ready?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Ready.
Speaker 1: This picture is, is sort of a fun picture and in, in a--in a good way depicts what Stanford medical school [Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California] was all about, and that is we, we had fun in addition to the serious business of, of learning to be the best doctors we could possibly be.  I served as president of the student body there at, at Stanford medical school during my senior year and this is just kind of a publicity shot to show that, with my classmates making fun of me.  Happily, I'm having the opportunity to go back to Stanford in May of 2005 to participate in an alumni reunion as a panelist, reviewing some of the progressions of diversity at the medical school.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Is that curled too much?
Speaker 1: This picture brings back fond memories of work together at a leper colony in Vietnam where there was a possibility to collaborate with and work with a group of the sisters in the leper colony.  The one to the far right helped us a lot because she'd had extensive experience as a nurse looking after lepers.  We had some experience with the surgical and rehabilitation aspects of it, but she was very helpful to us in terms of knowing about some of the natural problems with the disease.  But it was a, a, a real opportunity to be of service to a large number of patients in that leper colony, which was beautifully run and looked after by these nuns as well as some of the patients who lived and worked in the leper colony.
Speaker 2: This picture was actually taken in my apartment where--that I lived in in Sweden when I was doing research there.  It was a tremendous opportunity there to get some close exposure to the revolution.  I'm--admire and respect Malcolm X.  While I was there, though, Bobby Seale, came to speak in Gothenburg [Sweden], and actually because my apartment had some room, I was able to share that with him and his--a small part of his entourage over the course of about ten days when he was in Gothenburg, and interesting conversations with him at that time.  I gained--I already had respect but I gained more respect for him.  He was in a tight spot because in order to maintain his leadership to some sense, he had to be more radical, but he was wise to recognize that the, the, the dominant society was not ready to accept any more radicalism from the Panthers [Black Panther Party], it was just ahead of the Ohio State [sic. Kent State University, Kent, Ohio] tragedy, but yet it was hard to maintain his leadership and the same time protect his following and he wanted to pull in his arrow a bit at that time.  He navigated through that as best he could.
Speaker 1: This gentleman to my right is Dr. Wayne Southwick, distinguished professor of orthopedic surgery at Yale University [Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut] and well regarded and recognized internationally as a spine surgeon.  It was my good fortune that he took an interest and, and mentored me over the course of my orthopedic career, has been a, a, a dear friend, colleague, teacher, and a source of friendship to me and to my family, and I've had the pleasure of being friends with his family also.
Speaker 2: Eight [1978] or '79 [1979], I--I'll say '79 [1979].
Speaker 1: Do you wanna hold it?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Well, it's not gonna stay.
Speaker 1: It was taken in Atlanta [Georgia] in 1979 at the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons meeting.  Beginning to your left is Dr. Phil Wiltz [ph.] who was kind enough to organize a, a nice reception wherein I had the opportunity to present our book the 'Clinical Biomechanics of the Spine' [Augustus A. White III and Manohar M. Panjabi] to Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] family.  This is Daddy King [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.] as he was affectionately called to the immediate left of Dr. Wiltz and his grandson there holding the book.  The book was dedicated to Dr. Martin Luther King and to Mahatma Gandhi by me and the co-author, Dr. Manohar Panjabi.  On my immediate left is my mom and to her immediate left is Dr. Joe Hoffman [ph.], a distinguished orthopedic surgeon, as is the gentleman to his left, also a distinguished orthopedic surgeon in Atlanta.
Speaker 2: Okay.  This picture in a sense represents part of the joy and--of my professional life, which included an opportunity to be visiting professor in Japan on several occasions.  Here, I'm in the home of my host, the gentleman in the middle and his wife to his immediate right, and my middle daughter, Atina, who traveled with me, she was nine years old at the time.  And they, they actually dressed her, as you can see, in formal full dress kimono style.  We had a delightful experience there.  This gentleman was very kind to, to, to meet Atina's request to eat at McDonald's while she was there and he managed to find one whenever she needed something to eat while I enjoyed the magnificent Japanese cuisine.
Speaker 1: This picture is in some ways representive--representative of the current activities of lifestyle now and work in medical education.  The gentleman on the left, to the right of the picture as you look at it, is the dean of Harvard Medical School [Boston, Massachusetts], Dean Joseph Martin, and we are in the main reception room and faculty meeting room of Harvard Medical School.  The lady in the middle is Dr. Ruth Simmons, president of Brown University, and she was invited by our academic society to spend the day at Harvard Medical School.  It's unusual I think for a president to spend a whole day in one medical school, particularly the medical school of a different university.  Dr. Simmons was magnificent as an educator, discussing issues of mentoring and professionalism, which we are working on at Harvard Medical School at this time to the best of our ability including diversity and the important element of culturally competent care education.  So this was quite a celebration for us with Dr. Simmons and Dean Martin.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of the early part of professional activities at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center [Boston, Massachusetts] and Harvard Medical School where I, I worked when I came to Boston [Massachusetts], was recruited to Boston for this particular position.  It just--symbol--symbolic of orthopedic surgery, the musculoskeletal system, the mechanics of the system, the spine as you see in the upper left-hand corner and the leg and the--also the skeleton of the spine.  And most of our clinical work and research work related to diagnosing the malfunction of the musculoskeletal system and intervening therapeutically to try to help patients with problems in that area.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  What year was this?
Speaker 2: This would be 1990, 1989.  I'm sorry, let me change that.  It would be 1979 or 1980.
