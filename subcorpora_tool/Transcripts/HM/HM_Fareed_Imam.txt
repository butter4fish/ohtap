Speaker 1: Before we go into depth there are five lightweight warm up questions we always ask and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My favorite food is salmon.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color, I guess it would depend on whether you're talking about clothes, a vehicle.  I would say probably the earth tone colors, beige.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: I guess the favorite time of the year for me would be the observances that we have in our religion called the eid, I--I'm sorry, E-I-D, eid.  And, there are two of them and those are my favorite times of the year.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: No I don't (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: (Pause) No I don't.  No, I wouldn't say I have a favorite one.
Story_ID: 639311
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Samuel Hood, Sr.] side but we'll start with your mother's side first.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Yes my mother's name was Minnie, M-I-N-N-I-E Burts, B-U-R-T-S Hood [Minnie Burts Hood].  Her maiden name was Burts.
Speaker 1: Okay and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Oh.  Her date of birth, (pause) you've got me stumped now.
Speaker 1: Well, you, if you can just get us in the ballpark, that's, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's 19--I know the year, it's 1914 [sic. 1915] but the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --actual date I can't recall right now.
Speaker 1: Okay and where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in South Carolina, Greenville, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay now what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace that side, and--?
Speaker 2: I can't go very far because of my parents' age at the time I was born I never had an opportunity to know my grandparents on either side, my father's or my mother's side.  So I can't go very far in terms of who my grandparents were, great-grandparents.  I have done some research on it recently and I'm getting to know and learn a lot about my ancestors but at this point I can't go very far particularly on my mother's side.
Speaker 1: Okay, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But the Mays is there, the name of the family, M-A-Y-S and sometimes it's spelled M-A-Y-E-S.
Speaker 1: So this would be on your grandmother's [Lula Mays Burts] side, on that side (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  Correct.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Your grandmother's side were the Mays.
Speaker 2: Mays.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, well, can you tell us like what they did for a living, or what they--?
Speaker 2: Mostly sharecropping, farming, along that line.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Are there any stories passed down about, you know, any of the struggles that they had or accomplishments?
Speaker 2: No, no stories that I'm aware of in terms of their struggle except that, you know, obviously, the racism that they encountered in South Carolina, Piedmont, Greenville County but Piedmont, South Carolina that most African Americans during, during their time experienced but no specific details that I can, I can share with you about things that they encountered.
Speaker 1: Just a general sense that it wasn't a good place for black people.
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, no.  South Carolina--in the, you know, the South was during, during that time--you're talking about the 1800s, late 1800s.  It was a very troublesome time for most blacks or African Americans and most of us received--we were living under Jim Crow laws, we were living in fear of our lives--they were living in fear of their lives for fear of being hung or killed or anything for some of the most ridiculous, ridiculous things, you know.  So my family, my relatives, my ancestors were no exception.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now did your mother talk about growing up at all having stories that she shared with you about growing up or going to school or any of those things?
Speaker 2: No.  No, she never did and I guess I just never got around to asking about those kinds of things.  How did you grow up, what was it like and just never got around to asking those questions particularly of my mother, I think.  I got a little bit from my father but my mother; I never got around to asking her too many questions about those things.
Speaker 1: And, did she--I know some parents particularly in the last generation would really object to children asking about, you know, those kinds of things.  Was she like that, or (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't think she would have objected to me asking those questions.  She probably would have welcomed those questions--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --but I guess, it was, the fault is on me or the blame is on me that I never got around to really inquiring.  In hindsight obviously I should have. She's deceased now--she's passed.  So, whatever I find out at this point it would have to be through my research or through talking to my older siblings.  I have brothers and sisters who are much older than me who can perhaps share some of those stories with me.
Speaker 1: Now do you know how much education she was able to get down there?
Speaker 2: My mother went to the eighth grade, eighth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what did she do for a living?
Speaker 2: She was a laundry worker.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She retired from a laundry here in Norfolk [Virginia] after I think about thirty, thirty years or so.
Story_ID: 639312
Speaker 1: Now let me go to your father's side.  Can, can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes my father, father's name was Samuel Hood, Sr.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: January 29, 1912 and he was born in Piedmont, Greenville County, South Carolina also.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now where is Greenville, South Carolina in relationship to say Charleston [South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Well it's further up than Charleston.  Charleston is south of it.  It's probably closer to, I would say, maybe Columbia [South Carolina]. It's closer to Columbia certainly that it is to Charleston but it's--
Speaker 1: It's more towards the middle and north of it.
Speaker 2: Right.  North of Charleston and I would say probably north, northwest probably, northwest of Charleston.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, why- what do you know about your father's side of the family? How far back can you go with them?
Speaker 2: Well, on paper I can go a long ways (laughter).  I know that his father's name was William Foster Hood [William F. Hood] and his mother's name was Elizabeth [Elizabeth Derumple Hood].  Her name was Derumple, D-E-R-U-M-P-L-E, Elizabeth Derumple and she married my grandfather on his side, William.  And my brother's, my brother is actually named after my, my grandfather.  My brother who is deceased also, his name was William.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: William Arthur [William A. Hood].
Story_ID: 639313
Speaker 1: Before we started you, you showed me a paper that, that showed me the Hoods fought in the Revolutionary War.  There was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --an ancestor of yours.
Speaker 2: Yes, back- one of my [paternal] great-great-great-great-grandfathers' name was John, and, John Hood, and he had some sons and some of his sons fought under Andrew Jackson [President Andrew Jackson] under his leadership in wars during that time.
Speaker 1: So they were talking about the Revolutionary War.  There's a set--one started fighting in 1777 or something was that in the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  In the 1700s--
Speaker 1: --in the 1700s?
Speaker 2: I don't recall the exact date but the 1700s.
Speaker 1: And he was discharged around 1791?
Speaker 2: That's--yeah.
Speaker 1: And, now was he, so did he, was he considered a free person of color in South Carolina after the war or did they--'cause sometimes you would fight--if you were a slave you would fight and you'd be freed and then--but a lot of times they double back on their promise and they wouldn't free them.  So I don't know--
Speaker 2: My research thus far shows that he was free.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So far my research shows that he was free and he did this voluntarily, he wasn't forced to serve in that war under the leadership of Andrew Jackson, he did it voluntarily.
Speaker 1: Well, this is his son.  This would be the other--I mean a great-great-grandfather (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Grandfather's son.
Speaker 1: Yeah the son of the one who served in the Revolutionary War.
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.
Speaker 1: So this might imply that the one that served in the Revolutionary War was free because of his service.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Or may have been free already, I don't know (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes and again I'm just drawing conclusions because I don't, I can't prove that one way or the other at this point, I can't prove it.
Speaker 1: But the one that volunteered for Andrew Jackson, we'd have to assume that he was free or he couldn't volunteer.
Speaker 2: I'm assuming--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --that he was free, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was his--the one that served under Jackson, what was his name?
Speaker 2: Now that again I have that research on paper (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --but to give it to you off the top of my head, I can't give it to you.
Speaker 1: No that's all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He served in the Creek War, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Under Andrew Jackson, okay.  What--any other stories from that side?  Now what did they do in the 1800s, you go way back.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I actually traced the history all the way back to, I think Ireland on my father's [Samuel Hood, Sr.] side and I'm still studying that history.  That's why, that's the reason I can't give you all this off the top of my head because I'm actually still studying and trying to digest that history and I know that there is some other family members on my father's side, great-great-great-grandfathers who served in other wars but again to be, to give that to you right now and regurgitate it, I'm just kind of lost for it because I'm--all of this is documented on paper.
Speaker 1: Okay so there are no stories or anything from the 1800s, from the days of the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: --Civil War or any of that.
Speaker 2: No, I, I, I don't-- No.
Speaker 1: Okay and--
Speaker 2: No stories were passed along to me.
Story_ID: 639314
Speaker 1: As we get up to when, where your father [Samuel Hood, Sr.] was born in nine, 1912, I mean, is there anything leading up to that we need to talk about?
Speaker 2: Well, he, he was born as I said in Greenville, South Carolina [Greenville County, South Carolina] and he also worked as a, on, you know, doing farming work, sharecropping and things like that and when he did move to Norfolk, to Virginia, I know that he worked in several job occupations.  On one, at one point he worked for at the time what is called Norfolk Southern now but it was called Norfolk and Western railroad [Norfolk and Western Railway; Norfolk Southern Railway].  He worked there for a number of years and I don't know all of the jobs that he held but I do know that he finally became a carpenter for Norfolk City school, school board and he retired as a carpenter for Norfolk city schools [Norfolk Public Schools].
Story_ID: 639315
Speaker 1: I just want to go back a little bit to, back to South Carolina.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You were tell, telling me before we started that there's in that town--is it in Greenville?
Speaker 2: Yeah
Speaker 1: Where there's a whole street named Hood [Hood Road].
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-uh.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: The county is Greenville County [South Carolina], I think and it's, the town is called Piedmont [South Carolina] or the city is called Piedmont and I was--some years ago I was grown, I was an adult and just wanted to because I was born here in Norfolk [Virginia] and my older siblings were born in Greenville County and so there were thing that they were exposed to that I obviously wasn't exposed to.  So I was just really taking a trip to, further south down to Georgia but I wanted to stop in South Carolina and, you know, kind of get a, get a taste of my roots and my family history.  So I inquired of my mother [Minnie Burts Hood] and father [Samuel Hood, Sr.], you know, where could I find our relatives and they told me, you know, Piedmont and they told me there was this street there called Hood Street [sic.], it's named after my family.  And, so I went there and kind of looking for directions and I stopped at this little post office.  The post office was run by one person, older Caucasian gentleman and I asked him for directions but the way I asked for directions, I asked him did he know any of the Hoods, Charlie Hood [Charles Hood], Prelo Hood [Prelo Hood, Sr.] those are my uncles and he said, "Oh yeah, everybody knows them.  Everybody knows Charlie and Prelo and them."  I said, "Where can I find them," and he said, "Go across the railroad track and go about a mile and you make a right at such and such street and a left at such and such a street and when you get back over there," he said, "just ask anybody.  Everybody over there," he said. "In fact you're going to get to Hood Road," and I did and when I got to Hood Road I discovered that nobody else lived on that street and I think it's the same today but my family.  On both sides of the street that's all that lives on that street.
Speaker 1: That is a big family.
Speaker 2: Yeah we have a large family, we really do.  We have a large family.
Speaker 1: And a lot of property concentrated in one place.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah they had a lot of property and they still today own a lot of, lot of land down there in Piedmont, you know.  I'm not sure how it's being used at this point but they, they, they did own and still own quite a bit of land.
Story_ID: 639316
Speaker 1: What did your father [Samuel Hood, Sr.] say about growing up?  Did he have a chance to finish school or go very far in school?
Speaker 2: No.  My father, I think went--had a little less education than my mother [Minnie Burts Hood], maybe a year or so less than she did and as I told you she went to the eighth grade.  She had an eighth grade education and his was probably less. I know it was less, I don't know how much less.  But my father--I just recall him talking about hard times, you know, not only in South Carolina but hard times for blacks--African Americans in this city in Norfolk [Virginia] and wherever blacks were found--living at that time.  And I recall him and as children we used to laugh about it.  You know, we used to laugh about some of the things because by the time we had gotten into our teens and he used to tell us how much things cost when he was a little boy or back in the day he would tell us, you know, he could go to, you could go to the grocery store and take three dollars and you would have so much food that you would need--you didn't own a car so they had to call a cab or something or find someone who had a car to bring that grocery home because it was too much to carry in your arms, three dollars and for us that was, that was just something to laugh about.  I mean we just had a ball laughing, we laughed until we could, couldn't laugh anymore.
Speaker 1: Now did he tell you all that he grew up during the Depression [Great Depression]--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --when nobody had any money?
Speaker 2: Well, we figured that out later on (laughter).  We figured out later on that's what it was but at the time we were being told it was just hilarious because we were saying, "Three dollars?  Three dollars?"  You know, and we were looking at what we could buy at that time with three dollars, a dollar and he would saying that--he was just giving this picture that it went much, much further.  So it just seemed kind of hilarious to us but as I got older I began to realize the implications of the things that he was--had said to us about how difficult it was, how hard it was and the labor, the labor that he had to endure in terms of the wages that he made.  You know, he talked about working for fifty cents and my mother, I do recall my mother talking about working in the homes of white people here in Norfolk in the section that's called Larchmont, right now.  Larchmont and Edgewater, and I do recall before she started working at the laundry, I recall her going to work, you know, walking to work and doing house chores for white people who lived in the neighborhoods called Edgewater and Larchmont here in Norfolk.  Now, it is not too far from Old Dominion University [Norfolk, Virginia], where Old Dominion University sits now.  At that time that area was pretty much a wooded area.  It wasn't developed like it is now as a university.  So I do recall that and I do recall being somewhat, I would say, saddened by learning, about learning the amount of money or lack thereof that wages that they were making and the long hours that they working and I think I shared with you earlier that my oldest sister [Lomena Hood Johnson] who is seventy-six now so she's twenty years older than me, actually.  Twenty years older than me, my oldest sister and she actually helped to raise me in the absence of my--I shouldn't say in the absence of my mother because my mother was, what I intended to say was my mother was working all the time and my father was working.  So she was like a second mother and she helped to raise us, you know, while my mother was at work.  So, when I looked at that, I looked at the number of hours that my mother and father had to put in in labor and the small amount of money that they were making.  It was, you know, I guess I was saddened by it, you know.
Speaker 1: Is there a story that your father tells about why his parents [Elizabeth Derumple Hood and William F. Hood] moved to Norfolk in the first place?
Speaker 2: No I never, I never--
Speaker 1: Or did they move or was it just him?
Speaker 2: He moved.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He moved. His parents never migrated here to Norfolk.  They--as far as I know, they, when they deceased they were there in Greenville [Greenville County, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: So, did he have a story about how--why he came here?
Speaker 2: If he did, if he told it, I never heard it, you know.  Again, I would assume that my older siblings would know those stories and, because they were children.  I don't even think I was born at the time, so, and the fact that they never shared that with me.  I never inquired, they never shared it with me.  I have no, no knowledge or recollection of, of why he moved from South Carolina to, to Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, I, I can assume that it had something to do with employment, you know, but I'm, I'm not even certain of that.
Story_ID: 639317
Speaker 1: Is there a story that they tell or, or do you know how they met, how, how your parents met?  Or did they meet--they probably met in South Carolina.
Speaker 2: They met in--I know that they married in South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: How they met is beyond me but I can say that my mother [Minnie Burts Hood] and father [Samuel Hood, Sr.] remained married for over sixty years and my father--I never saw, never once saw him raise his voice, not once.  He was a person who could endure a lot of pressure.  He never, I never saw him get emotional.  My mother had Indian [Native American] in her blood, I do know that and my mother was a little more fiery.  She was a, as I called her, a straight shooter.  I never called her that in front of her face but behind her back I can say that she was a straight shooter.  She was a person who talked straight, she didn't, she didn't pull any punches, she called things like she saw it.  And my mother might be in an emotional state, you know, she might be upset about something and her expressions would come out in an emotional way and my father would sit there just like water running off a duck's back, it was like she wasn't even talking.  I never saw him hit her, to my knowledge he never did.  I never saw him raise his voice and I do know that, you know, he had a past like anybody.  I'm not saying that he was perfect man but he had a past of drunkenness, being a drunk and gambling and that kind of thing.  But--and I just vaguely recall some things as a child, you know.  Seeing him in a drunken state but for the most part of my life what I saw is him as a church person.  Around the time when I was a child is when he had begun to stop drinking.  And he stopped drinking and he started going to church--attending church and he became a deacon in the church, the treasurer for the church and well respected, well respected and well loved among church people not only the church he attended but throughout.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what denomination was he?
Speaker 2: He was Baptist.
Speaker 1: Now when you think about--when you consider your parents' personalities and their talents and their dispositions who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I think in terms of patience and in terms of temperament and pressure--being able to take pressure, it's no question I inherited that from my father, no question.  I'm thankful that he had those characteristics and those traits because in the field of work I'm in as a religion leader having to deal with people and I don't, I don't just deal with people of my faith tradition, I deal with people in general because of other things that I'm involved in in the community.  I need those traits and when I tell people I have for example been to the doctor and the doctor have asked me, "Are you under any stress?"  And I say, "Stress?  What are you talking about?"  It was like a foreign word to me and it's because the amount of pressure that I'm able to endure, and I don't, I don't mean to make myself any more than what I am but I do know that I can endure more pressure, more weight, more--I can juggle more than one ball at the same time and I know that in observing some other people they don't have that level of comfort when it comes to a lot of pressure.  A lot of things being on you at one time and I, it's no question that I inherited that from my father.  What I inherited from my mother was calling things like I see it and sometimes you know, you can be so direct and too direct, sometimes too direct.  But you can be so direct sometimes that sometimes people's feelings get hurt a little bit.  So I have to borrow from my father's side (laughter).  I have to borrow a little bit from him to keep from being, you know, being too offensive to people when you, when you, you know, when you, when you say something to them.  So, so those are traits that I inherited from both of my parents.
Story_ID: 639318
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yes, I have a lot of early childhood memories.
Speaker 1: What's the earliest thing, the first thing you think of all those memories?
Speaker 2: Giving my oldest sister [Lomena Hood Johnson] a hard time.  When she was babysitting us and I recall doing something that I regret and we both laugh about it now.  But I was a kind of mischievous child in some respects and I recall we had a little, little play handgun, little guns, you know, like boys born at that time, toy gun and I took the gun and hit her on the head (laughter).  I got in trouble obviously about that but that was a, that was a, something that we talk about now, my oldest sister and I, we talk about it and she talks about what she wanted to do to me but because I was her little brother she couldn't.  And, I would say in terms of the oldest memory that, that's probably it the thing that really kind of jumps out and outside of that is the memories of being with my brothers, my brother [William A. Hood] who was just a couple of years older than me. He's deceased now and my nephew who is six months younger than me.  And we all, my family all sing when we were coming up.  My mother [Minnie Burts Hood] had a good voice; my father [Samuel Hood, Sr.] sang bass; all of my family sing.  So we had singing groups like a lot of kids did during those days imitating The Temptations and Four Tops and different groups.  So, we had, I have a lot of memories of us rehearsing and practicing and at some point I went out and started my own band and travelled to Engelhard, North Carolina, different places, you know, singing songs like James Brown, some of his tunes and dancing and what not in nightclubs and I also recall the area that I told you that we grew up in was called Lambert's Point [Norfolk, Virginia].  It's the area--
Speaker 1: It's called Lambert's--?
Speaker 2: Lambert's--
Speaker 1: Lambert's Point, okay.
Speaker 2: Lambert's Point.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's the area where in part Old Dominion University [Norfolk, Virginia] occupies now but when I was growing up, Old Dominion University was just a couple of buildings, just a few buildings.  And, so much of that area where ODU is now was woods and we used to play, you know, in the woods.  You know, like just running through, making traps, booby traps, and just, you know, just having a good time and there was just, you know, we built little, little huts out there, you know, out of, out of sticks and things like that, you know, imitating things that we saw on television.  But they were fond memories of being with my brother and my nephew and of course I have another brother who is Samuel Hood, Jr.  He was a little older than us so he didn't, he didn't play with us, you know, he was a little older than us but those were some of the memories that I have grow, growing up.
Story_ID: 639319
Speaker 1: What are some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up [in Norfolk, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Say that again now.
Speaker 1: What are some of the sights, sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Some of the smells were smells of food.  What I mean is farmland.  My father [Samuel Hood, Sr.] had a garden.  It was about almost a block, a whole, almost a block maybe a half of block in size but we just called it a garden and he used to till the soil and plant corn and cabbage and different, different things, snap- string beans.  And, so, you know, growing up we hated, we hated having to go with him and pick corn and pick green beans and things like that but we had to do it because he told us, "Boy, come on and go with me and do this."  That's one smell, you know, the earth, the earth smell.  Another smell is the, is the smell of sawdust.  My father was a carpenter as I said.  So I remember him coming home from work every day and we used to run to meet him.  We used to run.  We used to--actually, my brother Bill [William A. Hood], Bill is older than me and my nephew who's six months younger than me, we used to race each other.  My father, he never drove, never drove a car so he would catch the bus to work and when he--two, three blocks down the street we saw him, we knew what time he got off work and we'd be in the yard playing and we can anticipate him coming and he always saves something.  He carried a lunch bucket with him, with him to work every day, a black lunch bucket and he always kept something in there and I guess was not so much because he didn't want to eat it but he just got a joy out of perhaps us running to him every day when he got off work.  So he would keep an apple in there or something sweet.  He always carried sweets, some kind of snack or half of a sandwich or something.  So we would run and meet him and whoever got to the bucket first, that's who got the goods.  So, you know, we enjoyed that, we enjoyed that challenge every day.  And, that was a--so meeting him immediately we could smell, I could smell the sawdust in his clothes from the work that he had been doing and on weekends like Saturdays if it wasn't go work in the garden and help him pick string beans or shuck corn or whatever, it was come and go with me, he would put up sheetrock, you know, or put some studs up, some two by fours and I recall hating that--disliking it.  And, as I got older when I had to, you know, provide a living for myself, I recall resorting back to that and I recall saying I wish I had paid attention, more attention when I was a little boy and I wouldn't have to now because I used to have to go back to my father and say, "Daddy, how do you do this, how you say you build a corner, you know, how do you do this, how do you cut a angle on a two by four?"  And, now, mind you, you know, my father was a carpenter who worked--the tools that they had are not as sophisticated as the tools we have today.  So they didn't have miter saws where you can just plug it up in the wall and put it on forty-five and then cut it with electricity.  You know, a lot of things had to be done by hand; you just had to know what you were doing.  So, and the tools, and I remember him having one of those drills that you cranked up like wind up like that, you know.  I think I've still got it somewhere as a keepsake.  But the smell to get back to your question that was one of the smells sawdust and sheetrock, the earth those are just some of the smells, coal because we had coal stoves.
Story_ID: 639320
Speaker 1: I remember we had at one point an outhouse unlike kids today, you know, we had, we had the outhouse, you know.  Not for a long period of time in my life, but, in my, in my years but as a boy I do recall going to the outhouse, you know, to use the, use the toilet and, so those are smells too.  Those are experiences that linger and coal because we had to shovel coal.  We got a coal stove--a pot belly coal stove and then we graduated to an oil stove.  And, we had wood and coal, we had to cut wood--as a boy I had to cut wood with an axe and shovel coal and then we graduated to the oil stove.  And, the oil stove was another smell, oil and my father used to, he used to work on the carburetor of that oil stove.  I remember many days, it would get clogged up, he would just take it apart, fix it, put it back together, take the, take the pipes and get a vacuum cleaner or something, a stick or something and get the soot out of the, out of the pipe, get it unclogged and put the oil in there, put a match to it, next thing you know we got heat again, you know.  So, those are just some of the smells that I have from childhood.

Speaker 1: You have how many siblings now, you know?
Speaker 2: That are living?
Speaker 1: Well, no.  The whole family (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, it was seven of us all together.
Speaker 1: Yeah, seven all--okay.
Speaker 2: It was seven.  Yeah, it was four, four boys and three, three girls.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where do you fall? You're the youngest?
Speaker 2: I'm the next to the youngest (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Next to the youngest.
Speaker 2: I'm the youngest boy--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and I have a sister who's a couple of years younger than me.
Speaker 1: Okay did you want to name them all, for us or--?
Speaker 2: Doreen, Doreen Hood Britt, she's married now her name is Britt, her last name is Britt.  Then myself, I'm next in line and then older than me is my brother who is deceased, William Arthur Hood [William A. Hood], William Arthur Hood, we call him Bill and then next to him was Samuel Hood, Jr., we just called him Sam Jr., Samuel Hood, Jr. and then older than him there was twins, Bobbie and Robbie--Bobbie Hood and Robbie Hood [Robbie Hood Griffin].  My brother Bobbie, I was just looking at the obituary the other day and just realized that he was, he was like forty-one years old when he, when he passed.  He died on Christmas day in 1975.  He had a twin named Robbie.  Robbie is still living, Bobbie is deceased and then the oldest is Lomena, Lomena Johnson [Lomena Hood Johnson], she is seventy-six years old; she still resides here in Norfolk [Virginia].

Speaker 1: Where did you start school, what was the, was the name of your first school?
Speaker 2: My first school was J.J. Smallwood [John J. Smallwood School, Norfolk, Virginia].
Speaker 1: J.J. Small- okay.  Was J.J. Smallwood [John Jasper Smallwood] a local educator or politician, black person?
Speaker 2: He was a politician.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I want to say governor or something yeah J.J. Smallwood--John Jackson Smallwood [sic.].
Speaker 1: Now, was the, were the schools integrated when you started, school?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this was like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: --a colored school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was, it was, it was all black school, my elementary school.  Now, then I went to James Madison Junior High School, they call it middle school [Madison School] now but it was called junior high school at that time, James Madison--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and then I went to Maury High School, Matthew Fontaine Maury, Maury High School [Matthew Fontaine Maury High School], all of them are here in Norfolk [Virginia] and when I went to Maury High School that's when integration had began about a couple of years prior to me going to Maury is when integration had started, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So I'm going to take you back to grade school, though.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now, did you like school?  Did you like going to school?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did and my subjects, my, that I liked the most were science and English.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I liked, I liked spelling and I liked science because of the, the research intrigued me.  So I liked school.  You know, I, again, I was known to be a little mischievous at times so I got in trouble and during those days, you know, when you got a beating the teacher could beat you as you know and I got a whipping by my teacher, a whipping by the principal one time and they would contact your parents and let them know and then when you got home you got another whipping.  So that's the way it was and my most vivid memory was being whipped one time at school, I don't know what I did but I recall getting a beating and being put behind what they call a stamp box.  They had these boxes that they used to, we used to sell, used to buy like savings bonds and things.  You know, they had a little, a little program where you could--it was a pretense program but it was like buying savings bonds and stamps.  And, so it was a little--
Speaker 1: You mean like the trading stamps for, that--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that you could take to the store and redeem them for prizes and--
Speaker 2: Stamps like post office stamps, like post office stamps (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --postal stamps and, but they had made this box in the, in the, in the classroom out of cardboard and made it look like a post office window or something--supposed to have been a post office.  But that's where you sit when you got in trouble.  It was like the dunce corner so to speak but I remember being set behind it.  That was humiliating, you know.  It was a humiliating thing to get whipped in the classroom then to be put behind there and then when I got home I got another whipping.  So, yeah, so, elementary school that's, those are some of things that I recall from being in elementary school but I did love, to answer your question, I loved, I liked going to school and I liked, I loved English and I loved science.
Story_ID: 639323
Speaker 1: Now, were the teachers, all your teachers black?
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In, in the beginning I guess?
Speaker 2: Yes, they were.
Speaker 1: And, the--did you have any favorite teachers there?
Speaker 2: Mrs. Shropshire [Helen Pope Shropshire], she's still living and I run into her now occasionally because she's very active in the community and by me being active in the community we run into each other and it's amazing for me to be able to tell her, well, she knows, I mean, she knows of my level of activity in the community here and, but I just like reminding her, "You remember you were my teacher." I like reminding her of that, "You used to be my teacher," and she'd say, "Oh, shut up boy. Don't--."   She don't want nobody to know she's that old.  And, there was another guidance counselor, her name is--I can't recall her name but it will come back to me in a bit but the reason why she jumps out at me because not only did she help to provide some type of stability and guidance even though I didn't always adhere to it but in the long run over the lifespan of my life, some of the things that she shared with me and taught me and words that she imparted, it came back, you know, I will recall all those things.  And, her brother, when her brother, her brother was an imam like myself and when he passed, I had no knowledge that her brother, that he was, she was his sister, had no knowledge of that until he passed.  And when he passed the family contacted me and when she told me her name, Perrier [ph.], Perrier is the family name but I can't, I'm trying to recall her first name, I can't pull it up right now.  I said, "You, did you used to be guidance counselor--teacher at Such and Such?"  She said, "Yes."  I said, "You were--," and I, even though she was a guidance counselor, I consider her a teacher.  I said, "You used to be one of my teachers." She say, "Oh, I did?" She say, "What's your name?"  And I told her and she said, "Yeah, I recall, I recall you, I recall you."  So, I don't know, I lost the question now--what the question was.
Speaker 1: Well, just your favorite teachers (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, so she was one, she was one of my favorite teachers.
Speaker 1: So, you went off from Smallwood School [John J. Smallwood School, Norfolk, Virginia] to James Madison [James Madison Junior High School; Madison School, Norfolk, Virginia], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, that's a middle school, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's like middle school, James Madison would be called (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Junior high school.
Speaker 2: --junior, junior high at that time. It's called middle school now.
Speaker 1: Now, when you--by the time you started junior high, did you envision yourself going to college or something or what did you think?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't, I really didn't.  I never thought about college. I didn't, you know, and I can't say that I was being driven, or, to go in that direction because I wasn't, truth of the matter is I wasn't.  I wasn't discouraged but I was not, it was not like it was something laid on me very heavily.  You know, you have to go to college, you have to go to college, you have to go to college, no, it wasn't.  So, I did, I did attend college, Old Dominion University [Norfolk, Virginia] but not for a long period of time, just some college credits, you know.
Speaker 1: I don't want to get you there yet.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We'll go back to that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: I just wondered if you were thinking about that in those days.
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Thinking about--
Speaker 2: I, I wasn't.
Speaker 1: And--
Story_ID: 639324
Speaker 1: What, what were your thoughts as a, as a young man about religion?  You--now, you were a Baptist, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was raised a Baptist.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Well, going to church was mandatory in, in, in those days.  You know, the whole spiel of shining your shoes on Saturday night, having special clothes that you wore only to church, you didn't wear your school clothes to church, you didn't play in your school clothes, you had clothes that you played in, you had clothes that you wore to school and then you had clothes that you wore to church.  So we had those, we had to get those clothes together, have them clean, shoes shined and everything on Saturday night in anticipation of going to church on Sunday morning.  Again, as I told you, my whole family were known for singing so we sang, we had a group called the Busy Bees [ph.], that's what they called us, the Busy--
Speaker 1: Like a youth singing (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A youth singing group called the Busy Bees. That's the name they gave us.  And, in the church and this is one of things that stuck with me, I didn't know at the time, and I wasn't trying to be smart but I had a uncle whose name is Clyde [ph.] who was the, he was the superintendent of Sunday school and I recall him in Sunday school one day him talking about the Trinity, the (pronunciation) Trinity, the trinitarian doctrine and He was, you know, God the Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost, et cetera and I just couldn't put it together.  I couldn't, I couldn't--it didn't make sense to me as a, as a little boy and, you know, I raised my hand and I said--he recognized me, I said, "Uncle Clyde," I said, "I don't--." I was letting him know that I don't understand that, it didn't make sense to me, "Can you, can you explain that in a way where it can make sense to me?"  And he told me, he said, "Boy, don't question God," and I wasn't trying to be smart and I said, "Uncle Clyde I'm not questioning God. I'm questioning you."  And, but I didn't get an answer, I didn't get an answer that, to my satisfaction, I never did get an answer.  So I, you know, I let it go but in the back of my mind that stayed with me, you know, and stayed with me, and I never made a real serious issue of it but that was kind of one of the things that led me to embrace Islam in terms of the theology of, and the concept of God.  That's one of the things that I could, embraced in the religion that I have now that I could not embrace in the faith that I was raised in, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you found it difficult to be able to get an answer for questions that you had about--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Nobody was willing to give you--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --a straight answer.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My, to my satisfaction.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, yeah.  Religion I think was the question, faith.  It was Christianity, it was a Baptist church and that church is, was in Norfolk [Virginia] on--again right where Old Dominion University is now--the campus of Old Dominion. That, that church was there and it has since been torn down. They have relocated to Chesapeake [Virginia].
Story_ID: 639325
Speaker 1: Did anything happen in middle school [James Madison Junior High School; Madison School, Norfolk, Virginia] that we need to know about, I guess, or, or, other than you, your, your subjects, the, the, the subjects that you were interested in the most in grade school [John J. Smallwood School, Norfolk, Virginia] were they still the same in middle school?
Speaker 2: Pretty much science, science pretty much stuck with me the whole time.  I just continued to have, be astounded and amazed about science, you know, you know, dissecting the frog and rocks, the curiosity about rocks and how they were formed, you know, clouds, the different types of clouds, what makes it rain, condensation and things like that.  Those things intrigued me throughout my whole life, you know.  So, I would say I stuck with that, I stuck with that interest.  I didn't, I wasn't dedicated to--now, here's the thing that happened also while I was in school.  It was the--and this happened in middle school, history was the subject that disturbed me because in studying history what I was learning--what we were being taught was, you know, the Revolutionary War and, you know, the different wars and that, you know, that took place here in America and the figures that we were taught of in the history class were for the most part white people, white figures.  And, I didn't see a reflection of my people, African American people, black people in the history lessons that we were being taught and I wanted to see where are our contributions, where are the contributions of my people. I'm not, I'm not hearing that, I'm not, and I recall making an issue of that.  And, consequently, I was one of about five people--students who were selected to go downtown and present to the superintendent of schools at that time, I don't know who, I can't recall the name of the person who was superintendent but I just remember that we had to go downtown and do some type of presentation to the, to the, to the superintendent of schools, and--
Speaker 1: A presentation to--
Speaker 2: About history, about our dissatisfaction about history.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, had you been, I know about what you--how old were you then?  About what?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess I was about twelve.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, this is 1967 or so?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you were about twelve years old.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Had you been exposed to any black history via the media or anything?  'Cause I know that was a time period where, you know, I think Bill Cosby started a special called--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --'Black History: Lost, Stolen, Or Strayed' CBS broadcast.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Black shows are starting up on air and things are being revealed--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --about our history that hadn't been talked about--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --before.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, you were kind of aware of that kind of thing--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess--
Speaker 1: --in TV or radio?
Speaker 2: --if not consciously, subconsciously.  I guess those things were engrained in my, in my, in my mind somewhere, but--
Speaker 1: What kind of information is coming into your house?  Were you getting the Norfolk Journal and Guide [New Journal and Guide] or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --or any of the other black newspapers, Afro American [Afro American Newspapers].
Speaker 2: No, no, we weren't, we--
Speaker 1: Jet or Ebony?
Speaker 2: Occasionally, a Jet magazine, Ebony magazine occasionally but not on a regular basis, on a frequent basis.  We were not receiving those type of publications.  So, that's not what influenced me.  I guess, it was just a sense of something innate, you know, something inside of me, a spirit or something inside of me that said I didn't see a reflection of myself--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and I wanted to see a reflection of myself in history.  Now--
Speaker 1: So, did you organize the group that--?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I--my recollection of it, that, is that one of the, one of the teachers actually organized the group and we went and we presented and I can't say that we caused a shakeup, you know, that we caused things to change but I do believe that in time some of what we shared with the superintendent of schools, it had an effect on what was being taught in the schools at that, at that level, the middle grade, or the junior high school level, you know, in terms of history.  I believe it had some effect on them changing the presentations and beginning to share more with the students, the history, the input of blacks into the wars; the role that blacks had in these wars, you know, and in, in, in the history of this country not only the wars but in the history of this country.  So that's, that's all I, I wanted to see.
Story_ID: 639326
Speaker 1: Did any, the males in your family fight in the Vietnam War or the, or World War II [WWII] or the Korean War (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My, my, muy [paternal] uncle, my Uncle Leroy [Leroy Hood, Sr.], he's about the only that I am aware of that fought in the Korean War, World War II but the Vietnam War, I don't recall anyone in my immediate family being in the Vietnam War.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So your--would you say at that time when you were twelve you had any idea of what black history was about at all?  Or was your--now, did you have a basis for a critique of the courses in the school? I mean did you know something about black history? Had you been reading it in the library or talking to somebody that knew something about it?
Speaker 2: No, no, I was not influenced by somebody sitting down to me and telling me something about Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth and--
Speaker 1: Did you know about any of them?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, that's the point. I mean, well, I didn't know but I felt, I felt that there had to have been somebody of my ethnicity who had made some contribution somewhere.  You know, you give me all this history and I don't see a reflection of myself and my people anywhere in this, there has to be something, you know.  Now, before--while in middle school [James Madison Junior High School; Madison School, Norfolk, Virginia] I also ran for president of student body and I won.  Now, the guy that I ran against was a friend of mine and he claims that I won because nobody knew who he was because everybody knew him by his nickname and so when we were politicking he had to use his real name.  And, his real name was Willie Owens; his nickname was Do Funny so everybody knew him by Do Funny.  So when he, when he, when he's politicking he has his little sign made up and I had my sign made up.  He had, he had Willie Owens on there, I said right back to him, "Well, who is Willie Owens?" So anyway he lost and I won but he claims--to this day he claims the reason I beat him out is because nobody knew who he was (laughter).
Speaker 1: He should have put both names on there so they would know but--
Speaker 2: He should have put aka, Willie Owens, aka Do Funny.
Story_ID: 639327
Speaker 1: What happened at the school board, did they listen to you, did they do something?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but before I, I tell you that I had a little revelation, a little recollection of my mother's [Minnie Burts Hood] birthday, it was July the 19th--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: July 19, 1915.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: So, just for the record.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, the, your, to your question what happened at the school board, did they listen?  I believe they, I believe they did and I have to say it like that because I didn't receive any correspondence from the superintendent or from anybody on his staff saying that, you know, "We have listened to your complaint, your concern and here's what we're going to do about it."  You know, I didn't receive anything like that because like I said first of all I didn't organize it.  I think the fact that I was one of the most vocal persons with respect to that concern may have sparked the need, or the, to--
Speaker 1: Now, had you been elected student body president at this point (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, not at that time, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: No, this was prior to that.
Speaker 1: This was prior to campaigning (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, prior to campaigning (laughter), prior to campaigning.  And, so, it, I believe, though--but I do believe it had some impact on the officials, you know, the school officials because in subsequent years I began to see a little bit more--and, I mean to an extent it was partially expected that as time went on there would be the transitioning of society to be more concerned and more sensitive to showing the accomplishments of blacks and African Americans whether it had to do with wars or whether it had to do with the building of this country or positions that they held, et cetera, you know.  So, I don't want to overstate it but I do believe it had some influence.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, it's a big deal anytime twelve year olds are allowed to meet with the school superintendent--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and discuss something, that, that's unusual.  And, so did you have the teacher, did a teacher accompany you there?
Speaker 2: Yes, they did--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --one of the teachers accompanied.  I think it was five or six of us students and now the other students who were chosen I can't even tell you who they were at this point and, but I believe that they were chosen based on their grades in school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Their accomplishments.
Speaker 1: And this is also where the governors of several Virginia schools are closing entire school districts down because they didn't want any blacks to go to school with any whites.
Speaker 2: That, that's right.
Speaker 1: So the superintendent (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right.
Speaker 1: --this is a white superintendent, apparently, made, met with you all.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: So, this is a remarkable kind of situation.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Story_ID: 639328
Speaker 1: Tell me this now, you're twelve years old, 1960 was this '5 [1965]?  We're talking about?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was born in '53 [1953] so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Fifty-three [1953] so six, sixty, yeah--
Speaker 2: Sixty--
Speaker 1: --seven [1967].
Speaker 2: No, sixty, sixty--
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty--
Speaker 2: --sixty-five [1965].
Speaker 1: Sixty-five [1965].
Speaker 2: About '65 [1965].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-five [1965].
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  So, '65 [1965] now is a time period where a lot of Af- not only African Americans but people around the nation become more aware of the Nation of Islam.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: How aware were you of the Nation of Islam in '65 [1965]?  Now, that was the year Malcolm X was assassinated.  That was all over the news--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and some years previously they had a CBS re- I think it was '61 [1961] or '62 [sic. 1959], Mike Wallace produced 'The Hate That Hate Produced' (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'Hate Produced,' right.
Speaker 1: --about the--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --Nation of Islam--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --which portrayed a basically negative light.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yeah, I was vaguely aware of the role of the Nation of Islam at that time.  As I, as--in the, in the black neighborhoods at that time you had groups emerging, Nation of Islam, Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee [SNCC], they came along later on, you had the Black Panther Party, black liberation movement, you had all these different groups that were emerging to address oppression and racism, Jim Crow laws, et cetera.  So just be, just living in the black community at that time you couldn't help but know something about these groups but I can't say that I was at that time familiar with their teachings.  You know, it was a little later--a few years later where I became--and in, my first introduction really came from just guys in the neighborhood.  Was a couple of guys, I don't, I don't want to call their names but there was a couple of guys that were in the neighborhood who were a little older than me but they were abreast, they knew, they were familiar with the teachings of the Nation of Islam and they would just stand around and just, you know, talk about those teachings, talk about the swine as you know especially black Muslims at that time--you didn't, one of the things you didn't do was eat pork.  So, they would talk about the swine, the pork and really that's what stopped me from--that's when I stopped eating pork and I remember telling my mother [Minnie Burts Hood] that I didn't want to eat anymore pork.  My mother was--I guess, because I was the baby boy she was very open to things that I wanted to do, whatever I wanted to do she was, she was kind of opened to it.  And, so I--what I'm saying that she didn't say, "Boy, you're crazy, you lost your mind, you've been eating pork all your life."  She didn't say any of that, you know; she just kind of went along with it.  And, from that point on when she, when she prepared the food for the family she would prepare something separate for me, you know, like fish or chicken or something else, she would, she would do something separate for me.
Speaker 1: So, pork was a big part of what you all were eating most of the time.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, I mean, you know, family at that time that's what you ate, you know, a lot of.  So, but after I had told her that I didn't want to eat anymore pork. Now at that time I wasn't a member of the Nation of Islam, I had just become influenced by those teachings.
Speaker 1: Now, what did they tell you about pork that made you want to not eat it (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well the teaching at that time was that the swine was composed of three animals, rat, cat and dog, one third rat, one third cat and one third dog.  And, I mean, it just talked about, you know, from the rooter to the tooter, you know, eating that, it just a lot of, a lot of jargon and, a lot of rhetoric and, you know, our minds were impressionable, you know, at that time and it had an effect on me to the point where I said, "I don't even want to eat it anymore of that," you know.  So, I stopped eating it and as time went on, you know, I began to learn a little bit more and a little bit more and a little bit more about what the Honorable, Honorable Elijah Muhammad was teaching, may God forgive him his sins and give him paradise.  What he was teaching and what that movement called Nation of Islam was all about and I eventually became a member of the Nation of Islam.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you become a member in high school [Matthew Fontaine Maury High School, Norfolk, Virginia] or did you, or was it after?
Speaker 2: No, in 1972 I think it was, 19--around 1972 (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay. Let, le- let's--
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-three [1973].
Story_ID: 639329
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Let's go through high school.  We haven't gone through high school--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --but--how was high school?  Did you, you know--?
Speaker 2: High school was--
Speaker 1: Did you take the general course, or the business course or the college course? Which one did you concentrate on in high--or did they have that separated like that in--?
Speaker 2: No, they had some business courses.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: They had a thing called DECA, D-E-C-A [Distributive Education Clubs of America; DECA, Inc.].  I'm trying to remember what it stood for, that acronym but it was a, it was a business course and we would go to school, I would go to school half day and I would work.  And, I worked at the Virginia Pilot newspaper [The Virginian Pilot] at the time, the other half of the day in the mailroom and inserted advertisements into the paper like the, you know, the Parade magazine and different advertisements from J.C. Penney's [J.C. Penney Company] and Kmarts [Kmart Corporation], Walmarts [Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.] and whatever that you see in the Sunday paper.  That was what we had, we did.  We inserted those magazines and advertisements into the, into the paper and you got paid according to--you got so much per hour and then you got paid according to how many bundles of papers that you could do.  Some guys were obviously faster than others.  So, there was a business course that I was in, in, in high school at Maury [Matthew Fontaine Maury High School, Norfolk, Virginia].
Story_ID: 639330
Speaker 1: Maury High School [Matthew Fontaine Maury High School, Norfolk, Virginia] had been a, a all white school at one point, and--?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was certainly all white.  In fact, it was, it was the premier, I would say along with Granby but a lot of the so called movers and shakers in this city that's where they went during that time.  They either went to Granby High School [Norfolk, Virginia] or Maury High School but a lot of them went to Maury High School from the west side of Norfolk [Virginia].  People who were in positions of leadership and politics, local government, business, et cetera, they, a lot of them came through Maury High School.  So, a few years prior to me going to Maury, it was all white, you know, and it changed just a few years before I went there.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause I've been, heard a couple of stories about Maury.
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: I think Cassandra Newby [HistoryMaker Cassandra Newby-Alexander] went to Maury.
Speaker 2: Right, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what, well, what was the atmosphere like that for, at Maury for you when you were there?
Speaker 2: Well, you could still feel the tension in the air, you know.  You could still feel a sense of whites having a sense of superiority and blacks having either because it was something instilled in them or because of the racism that was still in the air, a sense of inferiority.  I'm not as bett- as good as the next person or I've got to work two times as hard to get half as much as what they have or to achieve the grades and so on and so forth.  So, it was, it was--and, during that time again you're talking about the early '70s [1970s] where these movements were still growing, they were prominent, Black Panther Party, Nation of Islam, black liberation movement.  You know, a lot of that was still in the atmosphere trying to counter, trying to counter in their own respective ways the racism and the oppression and et cetera that we were experiencing as a people.  So, I think I was attracted to the Nation of Islam because of the teaching that said that well to use Jesse Jackson's [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] word, you are somebody.  Not that that's exactly what they said but the concepts of us being a people like God--a God like people.  You know, you're the Asiatic black man, the maker, the owner, the cream of the planet earth, father of civilization, God of the universe.  So these catechisms--you had to learn these catechisms and memorize these catechisms but within these catechisms there was, there were, there were jewels of self-esteem.  It boosted, it boosted our self-esteem and--
Speaker 1: So, were you studying during high school?  I mean, any (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I wasn't.
Speaker 1: --(unclear) about the Nation of Islam.
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't, I wasn't.  Again, a lot of it just came from being in the neighborhood.  A lot of the studying, teaching--
Speaker 1: So you were--Some of the teaching was coming to you--just kind of sort of coming in--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --from out there.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: But, did you take a leadership role at all in, at Maury like you did when you were in junior high school [James Madison Junior High School; Madison School, Norfolk, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, I didn't.  When I was at Maury, I was just trying to get through, get out.  I didn't have the interest in school like I did in elementary school [John J. Smallwood School, Norfolk, Virginia].  In high school I didn't have the interest like I did in middle school or junior high school or elementary school.  When I got to high school I just was ready to get out.  I didn't, I didn't, I wasn't thinking about college at all, you know, not at all.  In fact, well let me stick with high school right now.
Story_ID: 639331
Speaker 1: What did you envision yourself doing when you got out of high school [Matthew Fontaine Maury High School, Norfolk, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I guess to be honest with you the streets had a pull on me at that time and I guess I just wanted to get out and, and be a part of what was happening in the streets, you know.  And to some extent, I did, you know, become a part of what was happening in the streets.  It had an attraction on me as it did I guess a lot of young African Americans at that time.  You know, there was the era of 'Super Fly,' and, you know, the song, the movie was out, I'm sorry, and the song too but that era had such an effect on many of us at that time that that life, that lifestyle was a kind of attractive lifestyle.  Something that you wanted to be a part of and obviously that wasn't happening in school, you know.  So, in order to be a part of that lifestyle you had to leave school and go out there and be in that world.  But in, but out there in the world there were people, there were guys who were standing around on the corner, you know, just talking and saying things about self-esteem also, you know, because the street people--I'm going, I'm going to use the term quote unquote street people for right now.  At that time were not like the kids today in terms of sensitivities.  They, even though they were in the street, they still had respect for women; they had respect for--a certain amount of respect even for authority, even police authority.  I would say far more than what young kids today, they have.  A woman was coming down the street, you know, you would hold your tongue, you wouldn't use profanity and if another guy did it, he might go, he might, he might be carried around the corner and say, "Man, didn't you see that lady coming down the street?"  You know, I mean, he would be, would be chastised for that, verbally chastised if not physically chastised.  So that was--but it was also a concern in many for dignity, to have some kind of dignity and respect as a people, recognition as a people and so with all the mischievousness that was going on, there still was this interest of having some type of dignity as a people.  So different people would gravitate to different movements whether it was Nation of Islam or Black Panther Party or Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee [SNCC] or whatever depending on where the person found themselves, the environment they found.  If they were in college for example, they probably most likely got with Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture] and that movement, you know, if they were perhaps in another venue, another area they may have gotten caught up with the Black Panther movement, you know, so, or the Nation of Islam.  So, it just depended on where you found yourself, the environment you found yourself in not only the physical environment but the psychological environment that you found yourself in would dictate where, what direction you wound up going.  So, for me it was the Nation of Islam that had an appeal.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This was while in high school, while--
Speaker 2: A little, little, little bit shortly after high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: My mistake. (Unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But I was getting some--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, the street attraction stuff was going on, and, while you were in high school.  I know that was also the era when some of the movies you mentioned, like, were starting to come out.  The so called blaxploitation movies about (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right.
Speaker 1: With, you know, but--action movies--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --black hero who was from the streets--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --victorious over, you know, white oppression on some level.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Or some, you know--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --the cops or whatever.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, so did you watch a lot of those movies as you--?
Speaker 2: Yes, I watched as many as I say the average young man at that time would.  As you say black exploitation movies as well as those that portrayed a black man championing over--becoming a champion over oppression, you know, and during that time I began to read a little bit more, you know,  and reading a little more, educated me a little bit more about history, about contributions that African Americans had made.
Story_ID: 639332
Speaker 1: Now, did they start teaching any black history in the, in the public schools when you were in high school [Matthew Fontaine Maury High School, Norfolk, Virginia] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, they did.  Yes, they did.  That's what I was saying.
Speaker 1: Did you have a course in the--
Speaker 2: So, you know--that's right because there was, it was a kind of a natural evolution I think that not only here in Norfolk [Virginia] or in the South but I think that throughout and particularly I would say throughout the South where there was a transitioning because, you know, we have to also take into consideration that there were certain things that government began to do on a national level that brought changes about.  And, certainly we can't overlook the Civil Rights Movement, Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and those who struggled to help bring about changes and, 'cause along with all the other groups I mentioned, we had that movement.
Speaker 1: How did, how did you feel, how did the people that were influencing you feel about Dr. King and the Civil Rights Movement?  I mean, he was shot in 1966--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --nineteen sixty-eight [1968] in Memphis [Tennessee].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: April 4th.  Do you remember what you were doing that day and what you, what happened?
Speaker 2: The day that Dr. King was killed I don't remember what I was doing and, you know, it's sad to say but I remember more of what I was doing, where I was when Kennedy was killed.  I do remember where I was when he got killed but when Dr. King was killed--the day he was killed I don't recall where I was and what I was doing.
Speaker 1: Was there, was there violence in the community?
Speaker 2: Not a, not a large amount of violence and, you know, that's one of the things that I've had so called intellectual discussions with some people about, some scholars of history and just some people that I respect, I respect their opinions.  And I've had these discussions with them about this area in particular- why we didn't have the degree of burning and looting that they had for example, in Detroit [Michigan] or Chicago [Illinois] or Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] or some of those cities like that.  Not just because--and what we concluded, at least what I have concluded it was not just because of the size of the city in terms of population that brought this thing--or even the degree of black, the proportion of blacks in this city in contrast to whites in the city.  I think, we--one of things we looked at was that this area has been a transit area for a long time because of the big presence of [U.S.] military here.  So, a lot of people who are here, that, it's somewhat rare, not, I wouldn't say extremely rare but it's somewhat rare to find a native Norfolkian, you know.  To find somebody, you say, "Where are you from?"  Yeah, 'cause you just go around, "Where are you from?"  "Oh, I'm from Cleveland [Ohio]" or "I've been here for fifteen years or seventeen years or twenty-one years but I'm from Cleveland originally."  "Where are you from?"  "I'm from Atlanta [Georgia]" but you would, you would be a little pressed to say, "Where are you from," and they say, "I was born and raised here in Norfolk," like myself for example.  Because it's such a transitory area because of the high concentration of military here.  You know, the largest naval base in the world [Naval Station Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia] and with all these military facilities here a lot of people they come here as a result of service in the military and they wind up some staying and, you know, building a life, establishing a life here.  But even the African Americans to some extent, a lot of them fit into that kind of mold.  So, I think that you mentioned Heidelberg [HistoryMaker Andrew Heidelberg] and them early- we talked about, you know, we know that their history and people like that who have had an impact on the history of change in education and others who have had a history having an, have had an impact on the history of oppression, fighting oppression in this area.  But by in large that's one factor, we're not, we're not going to say, "That's the only factor," but that's one factor I believe that contributed to the lack of activity that we saw in other cities in terms of burning down the stores and the establishments of business people in the community and protesting in very large and pronounced ways like we saw in some other areas.
Story_ID: 639333
Speaker 1: So when you were getting ready to graduate from high school [Matthew Fontaine Maury High School, Norfolk, Virginia], what were you, were you thinking about just getting involved in the streets, activities or what?
Speaker 2: You know, I think I had on my mind of just making money (background noise).  You know, I just wanted to--I think in my heart I've always wanted to be a businessperson and I began to think more about having an impact in the landscape and I wanted to be a businessperson.  But, and I'm saying a businessperson, I wanted to make money and when you just want to make money, you don't always want to do it--you don't always have an interest in doing it legally.  You know, you--if money is the object then legal, making it legally is not necessarily your first objective.  But at the heart of that--the core of my being I have wanted to be a businessperson.  So, I didn't have an interest in college. I just, to be honest with you, I didn't have an interest and desire to finish high school and go to college that was not, that was not on my radar screen, you know.  It was--the interest more was in trying to acquire some means, some financial means.
Speaker 1: So, what did you do with your--?
Speaker 2: Well, I wound up not doing a whole lot (laughter) in that area, you know.  Just getting mediocre jobs, you know, and later on, it wasn't until later on in my life when I had started a family that I thought about going back to college and I was influenced by a person at that time who had, who had made an impression on me as a psychologist and that was Dr. Na'im Akbar [HistoryMaker Na'im Akbar].  I was, I was influenced by--I was impressed I would say by his ability to analyze situations particularly when it came to race relations.  Blacks and whites and, you know, the psychology of people and what makes people do this and what makes people do that.  So, I--then I started thinking about being a psychologist.  So, when I did enroll in college, what I--I took courses like logic, statistics, criminology and psychology but I really was, I really was concerned about being a psychologist.
Speaker 1: Now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And then--
Speaker 1: --when was this? When did you decide to go back to college?
Speaker 2: That was--we were married and we had--I was working at the naval base [Naval Station Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia] at the time, so--
Speaker 1: And you had been out of high school for how long at that point?
Speaker 2: Let's see how many years.  It had to be a good eight years or better.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A good, good eight years or better.
Story_ID: 639334
Speaker 1: I was, I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Because--
Speaker 1: --thinking this, you know, what you did when you got, when you, immediately got out of high school [Matthew Fontaine Maury High School, Norfolk, Virginia].
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was--
Speaker 1: So, you were a member of the Nation of Islam by then, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: By the time that you--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, within that eight years.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, maybe we should talk, maybe talk about that and then--
Speaker 2: The Nation of Islam?
Speaker 1: --get you to college, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Nation of Islam.  I embraced the Nation of Islam, the teachings in 1973.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-three [1973], and I think I've already elaborated on the--
Speaker 1: Some of why, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the attraction.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  But, was there members that you knew that really shepherded you into the Nation or did you go there by yourself just--?
Speaker 2: No, I wouldn't--no, I wouldn't--no, I can't, I can't say honestly say that there is somebody that I knew--I mean, obviously persons that I knew in previous years who had--for example, I told you people who had shared things about pork who were successful in getting me to stop eating pork.  Now, these people were not people themselves in the Nation of Islam, they were just people who just knew something about the teachings and they would just stand around and just regurgitate it but they themselves were not members of the Nation of Islam, you know.  But, what they shared with me had an influence on me so that when I embrace, when I did embrace the Nation of Islam, I had already stopped eating pork several years prior to that not knowing that this was one of the things that, you know, you had to do if you were going to be in the Nation of Islam, you couldn't be eating pork among other things.  You had to clean your life up, you had to, you know, you couldn't be drinking, you couldn't be, you weren't supposed to smoke cigarettes, you were supposed to live a clean life.  You were supposed to, you were supposed to work and whoever you worked for you were supposed to give that person an honest day's work. Those were the teachings of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.  That you would you--if--he said, "If you work for a white man," he said, "you give that white man an honest day's work," you know.  And, you know, you had to be clean, shoes had to be shined, you know, you had to have the bowtie and the whole nine yards, all of that had to be in place if you were a member of the Nation of Islam.  So there was no person in the Nation of Islam, I would say that drew me, you know.  I just was attracted to the teaching, you know.
Speaker 1: Well, what--where did you go?  Tell me about your first experience of going to--
Speaker 2: To temple?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Temple was on Church Street [Norfolk, Virginia] and they had classes, FOI classes--Fruit of Islam classes and you had to go through the training, you know, the drills because it was a combination of--the Nation of Islam was a combination of a lot of things.  It was a combination of military drill, drills, it had borrowed something from Booker T. Washington, it had borrowed something from Noble Drew Ali and Marcus Garvey that movement and even Christianity.  It had some, it was a smorgasbord of ideas that had been merged into one concept called Nation of Islam.  So, it's not--
Speaker 1: Oh, you could finish the sentence (laughter).
Speaker 2: So it's not the purity of, of the religion.
Story_ID: 639335
Speaker 1: You've gone to the temple and you're taking courses with the Nation of Islam (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: FOI.
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: The Fruit of Islam.
Speaker 2: Fruit of Islam.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: And, you were just explaining to us that the Nation of Islam as you understand now--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --was not Islam--
Speaker 2: The purest, that's right.
Speaker 1: --orthodox Islam--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --at all, at all.
Speaker 2: Not at all.
Speaker 1: But, and in those days did you have an understanding of that, or did you--?
Speaker 2: No, no, we came to understand that, but initially didn't, we didn't understand that.  I didn't understand that and most of the members didn't understand that. We were drawn to the Nation of Islam for the same, some of the same reasons that I have espoused and people had different reasons as to why they wanted to come.  Women sometimes they came because they liked the respect that men showed the women.  You know, opening their car doors, treating them with respect, making sure they were safe.  Some of them liked to dress, the modest dress, some of them were looking to clean their lives up, you know, and live a more productive and prosperous and dignified life and they felt they could achieve that through the Nation of Islam.  So, we all came for various reasons, you know, but as--back to the classes, you know, there were classes for men and classes for women.  Women had the MGT classes, Muslim Girls Training classes and the other one was I believe General Civilization Class, GCC, General Civilization Class where they were taught how to cook and do things like that.  And, eventually if I can fast forward, around 1975 the son of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad--well, Elijah Muhammad, the Honorable Elijah Muhammad passed and then his son--
Speaker 1: Yeah, he passed in '74 [1974].
Speaker 2: Yeah, and then his son W. Deen Mohammed [Warith Deen Mohammed], Imam W. Deen Mohammed--Wallace Muhammad became the leader for that movement called Nation of Islam and immediately he begin to dismantle.  So, my experience being a part of the Nation of Islam was not a long and drawn out experience.  It wasn't years and years and years, it was, it was brief in comparison to many.  So, it, when Imam W.D. Mohammed became the leader for that movement, he began to dismantle it, the Nation of Islam in this respect, you know, you used to have to send--the local temples used to have to send a lot of money to Chicago [Illinois]. He stopped that he said, "Keep your money at home, build your temples, build your community there where you are."  The captains--we had cap- we had a military hierarchy just like you have in the, in the, in the [U.S.] Army or the [U.S.] Navy or whatever, captains and lieutenants, et cetera he got rid of all of that.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He disbanded the Fruit of Islam?
Speaker 2: Yes, disbanded all of that.  You know, it was kind of gradual but he did it.  That was a, it was a gradual movement towards dismantling all that needed to be dismantled and building up what needed to be built up.  So, all of that was done away with and as, and as looking back at that even when we were experiencing it, the more he took off of us in terms of having captains and lieutenants over you and, you know, you almost, you literally were forced to at that time to be, to go out and sell the newspaper, the Muhammad Speaks newspaper [Muslim Journal], the fish--
Speaker 1: From what I understand the dynamic was that you had to pay up front for the paper.
Speaker 2: You had to pay for your--
Speaker 1: And, then you had, then you had to get your money back by selling.
Speaker 2: Selling your papers, so, yeah.  So, and, but some would, some would, some would, we found out later, some would--that brothers would take the papers and put--stack them up in their garage.  A year later after everything was over with, people would go in brothers' garages and say, "Man, those are the papers you've had for the last five years. You haven't been selling papers. You've just been buying them and stacking them up in the garage."
Speaker 1: There's also, I've heard--now, I don't know if you know about this but I've heard that though everybody was opposed to or it wasn't equally--people were not equally charged to sell the paper.  Some people did not have to sell as many or did not have to carry the same load as others (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.  There were some disparities, there is no question about there was some favoritism shown to certain people and disparities here and there, yeah, that happened.  And, even from temple to temple, you know, some things that Muslims for example here in Norfolk [Virginia] in Temple No. 57 learned later that people for example in Chicago Temple No. 2 were doing--it was like, oh, you all still--they would say, "You all are still doing that?  You know, we've been stopped doing that."  'Cause they were headquarters.  Headquarters was in Chicago, temple number two.  So, temples around the country and Norfolk was designated as temple number fifty-seven.  You know, they were still doing some things that had been really done away with, you know, by the standards of headquarters.
Story_ID: 639336
Speaker 1: How did you feel about that transition because it, it's quite a commitment to be a member of the Nation of Islam--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and you've committed a lot of your life's energy to it even just for two years and now, all of a sudden you're being told that what--that it's wrong or we should go in another direction.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What was the official line they were giving you?
Speaker 2: Well, I tell you I think I felt like and I think I can speak if, for the majority, I'll go so far to say I can speak for the majority and if not the majority a large, large population of us who were members of the Nation of Islam and some of them are present right here today in this room that we felt comfortable, we felt like Imam Mohammed [Warith Deen Mohammed] was freeing us.  It was like a freedom that, you know, oh, man I don't have to, I don't have to go to class every Saturday morning or I don't have to sell fish, and I'm not made, I'm not forced to sell fish, I'm not forced to sell bean pies, I'm not forced to sell the Muhammad Speaks [Muslim Journal], you know, I don't have to wear this uniform anymore, you know, I'm free and that was the objective to free us, to, and to bring us to the religion properly meaning the Qur'an [Koran] and life example of Prophet Muhammad, prayers and peace be on him.  That was the objective of Imam W. Mohammed to bring us gradually to the religion properly as some would say orthodox Islam.  And in doing that again he was, he was, he was instituting things that freed us up.  So--
Speaker 1: I, I've heard this before from members of the Nation in Chicago [Illinois] that would say that they felt relieved.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, they did not wish any harm upon Elijah Muhammad--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --but when he passed they felt relieved.
Speaker 2: They felt relieved.  And, I mean--
Speaker 1: And, they--but, I guess people on the outside of it would have to wonder on some level like well, if everybody felt relieved I mean, and was stressed out doing some of the activities why didn't they just stop, you know?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, is it--how difficult would it be to stop (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, a person, a person in the Nation of Islam at that time and some, again many were more ingrained in it than I was.  You know, I used that--sometimes I use the expression that Imam Mohammed used, he said, "Some of you, some of you are not as shell shocked as others" (laughter) because it wasn't like I was around there for fifteen years doing that.  So, I wasn't shell shocked.  So, when I, when that relief came, it was, it was comfortable to me.  It had just been a few years for me having to endure, you know, the drilling and the, you know, the things that we had to do.  So, it wasn't a long period of time for me.  So, it wasn't difficult at all, it wasn't difficult at all and we welcomed the change.  Not only did we welcome the change I would say socially but intellectually.  When Imam W.D. Mohammed became the leader what he was sharing, the level that he took us to intellectually was on another plane, it was a whole 'nother plane and it was light years in terms of the distance from what we had been given in the Nation of Islam in terms of what he was teaching.  Those who, Muslims who lived in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], for example where Imam W.D. Mohammed had lived for a few years, people who lived in Oakland [California] where he spent some time, he lived in Oakland for a few years and obviously Chicago.  The places where Imam Mohammed had lived, they had been getting bits and pieces of that, those jewels for a long time when he, when he was in there--while his father was living 'cause you know the history was that his father put him out twice and that was because he was teaching something different than his father was teaching when his father was alive.  And, when his father called him in on the carpet then, you know, to address it and he told him he said, "Daddy, that's your God, W.D. Fard [Wallace Fard Muhammad]. That's your God. That's what you believe," and he let him know, you know, "I respect you, Daddy, and, but I just, I don't believe the way you believe."  And he, and one time he told us, he say his father told him, "Son, just don't rock the boat, just don't rock the boat," you know, and he let him go.

Speaker 1: I'm wondering now about some of the, about the Nation of Islam in terms of history and as a historian I used to wonder how they could believe the Yakub story.
Speaker 2: Um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And some of that.  You know that a lot of our, a lot of black history as you pointed out earlier is not told and we don't know but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that story, well, it just seemed like it was just--
Speaker 2: Bizarre.
Speaker 1: --unbelievable--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and bizarre.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And how--yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: You know, (unclear) I go, well, how can anybody believe this?  I'm not, I mean--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --there are people that have, feel the same way about the Book of the Mormon ['The Book of Mormon: An Account Written by the Hand of Mormon upon Plates Taken from the Plates of Nephi,' Joseph Smith] and other things, too.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know, there are other things that come across--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --come along in ways and you say, "Well, how can anybody believe this?"  But, did you think that way when you were in the Nation at all?
Speaker 2: Well, when we were in the Nation, we didn't, I guess we didn't perceive it like we perceive it now because stepping back, stepping out from that movement and away from that movement and looking back at it we say, we take the same position that you take.  You know, how could I have believed something like that, you know, and there was a time when I believed something like that but how could I have believed something like that?  Well, the Honorable Elijah Muhammad was a, was a masterful psychologist and what he did, he--a part of, a part of what he did was he used reverse psychology.  In this respect we were told or taught--I say we meaning black people, we were taught either through suggestions, through suggested teachings or overtly just outright that whites were superior and black were inferior.  Well, Elijah Muhammad, the Honorable Elijah Muhammad reversed that and he essentially gave us a teaching that said, "Blacks are superior and whites are inferior."  So, all that came along with that package became believable; you know, so it was a whole package deal.
Speaker 1: It was a, it was a vindication of a wrong, a previous wrong.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, it was, it was, the fact was it was lumped into the package that made it kind of palatable for many of us, many of us to--if it had been given to us all by itself, it might not have been, and I, we might not have swallowed it hook, line and sink.  But the fact that it was packaged in the deal, it made it palatable for us to digest it--accept it.  But as time went on and once the light came on the scene, I say the light meaning the, what, Imam W.D. Mohammed [Warith Deen Mohammed] begin to teach, you begin to say, "Hold, you know, I can't go with that anymore, I can't accept that anymore, I can't accept this teaching about Yakub graft the devil.  You know, I can't accept about how the, how the earth was created, and, you know, I can't accept these teachings anymore, I can't, I just can't accept it. It's nonsense, it's nonsense."  So, you know, we left that, we left that movement, we left that thinking, we left all of that.  The things that helped to bring dignity, dignity to us, we brought that along with us, keep your shoes clean, you know, stay nice and clean, be respectful, give a man a honest day's work for his dollar.  You know, those are things that we took from the Nation of Islam and many Muslims today who did not go, particularly I'm talking about African American Muslims who did not go through that experience, they don't, they don't have that sense of keeping your shoes clean and being dignified--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: --they would rather look like they just got off of a, a, a camel, you know, riding through the streets of Norfolk [Virginia]--Main Street in Norfolk.  You know, like they just came off the desert because they didn't go through that experience that we went through.
Story_ID: 639338
Speaker 1: There's a scene in Spike Lee's 'Malcolm X' movie where I think it kind of summarizes how black, most black people still feel about the Nation--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in terms of the things they like about the Nation.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: It's the scene where Malcolm [Malcolm X] is in the police station and he, in a dispute with a police officer, he shows the cops a Nation of Islam downstairs and these brothers all do a guide right at once.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: It's that discipline, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, a sense of power--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --from discipline--
Speaker 2: Exactly right.
Speaker 1: --that makes--and it was dignified.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right, you know.  'Cause, you know, you take a young guy off the street regardless of what his ethnicity is and you put him in the military, he gets training, it's regimented, it's regimented, it's military, drilled, drilling, it's staunch, it's fixed but that person has a sense of respect, that person has a sense of dignity, that person carries themselves in most cases with a sense of pride.  That's been instilled, instilled in them from that type of environment.  So, it's the same thing in the Nation of Islam.  That environment produced certain things--good things in many of us that we still treasure today and those things are also the things that helped, propelled us forward.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know, I think that your analogy is good except that I don't see the--you see some people change by the military but often they leave that alone when they are out of the military.  I mean you see them do things that are not in order when they leave (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: And, but the Nation seemed to--you know their whole life, I guess that's what the pressure was about (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --on some level--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --prior to exhibit--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --this discipline all day long.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  It was, it was twenty-four, seven, you know, regimen, twenty-four, seven and you had the inspectors who used to go to people's houses and check to make sure that you weren't doing this and weren't doing that and that you were doing certain things that's supposed to have been, you know.  So, it was a, it was a whole life- lifestyle that you were subjected to, you know.
Speaker 1: So, the--really trying to find a middle ground in there someplace between the two, the extreme discipline and a, you know, a more relaxed discipline.
Story_ID: 639339
Speaker 1: Did you, you think in your opinion that most of the former mem- members of the Nation go, go into orthodox Islam?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Or did--okay.
Speaker 2: No, no, no doubt about it, no question.
Speaker 1: I had the same sense, but I thought I'd ask you (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes.  It's no questions about it; I mean the statistics will bear me out on that.  Even Minister Farrakhan--what a lot of people don't know [HistoryMaker] Minister Louis Farrakhan for almost three years--when Imam W.D. Mohammed [Warith Deen Mohammed] dismantled the Nation of Islam, Minister Farrakhan himself followed Imam W.D. Mohammed and then after almost three years, he decided he wanted to go back and resurrect the Nation of Islam because he, in his view there were a lot of brothers and sisters who were still out there in the gutter, you know, deprived and needing help.  So, you know, that was his, he felt that was his calling.  So, he went back and he reestablished the Nation of Islam and of course the overwhelming majority of us went forward, you know, and when people--it was surprising to many people because these kinds of things are not known--the media doesn't publicize these things but in terms of the number of following that, and I'm not trying to pit one against the other, I'm just trying to state a fact here.  The number, the number of followings that Imam W.D. Mohammed had in contrast to Minister Farrakhan was substantially different.  Minister Farrakhan had more of an attraction--power when it, like if--for example, if he would go to a city to speak, he could fill up a football stadium, you know, but in terms of actual following, the actual following that he had and still has is, was significantly smaller than that of Imam W.D. Mohammed.  And, that's not to say that numbers are everything but I'm just trying make a point about--to build on this point about how many of us left the Nation of Islam and never went back to that movement in contrast to, you know, how many, how many stayed and in the case of Minister Farrakhan, again he himself, he followed Imam W.D. Mohammed for almost three years and then he went back and reestablished the Nation of Islam.
Story_ID: 639340
Speaker 1: There are different forms of Islam--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and, and Wallace--Imam W.D. Mohammed [Warith Deen Mohammed] had a certain form he, I think he was a Sunni Muslim, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But there were other forms.  Did you feel the need to explore the other forms too of Islam or did you--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --or even some other philosophy 'cause you are now free?  (Unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Unclear). Well, let me say this though if I can back up.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now, prior to me even accepting to be a Muslim even in the Nation of Islam I had studied, I studied on my own various faiths.  You know, I researched Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism.  I knew a lot about Christianity because I was raised as a Christian at least in the Baptist persuasion and I, what I gathered from all of them was that there's truth in all of these faiths, you know.  And, now I can't say that I understood this then or I had this kind of position or stance then that I have now but the stance that I have now is that what I believe and what I accept is that the faith of Al Islam is taking the best that we have from these other faith traditions and I see it--for me I see it combined in this faith called Islam or Al Islam, that's what I see.  Now, in terms of these various, I'm going to call them mathhabs--schools of thought that we have in Islam, you know, the Shi'ite, the Hanbali, the Hanafi, the different schools of thought.
Speaker 1: Ahmadiyyas even are, there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, even Ahmadiyyas.
Speaker 1: Those were the, I think the original--in the early days a lot of black people were Ahmadiyyas before they were (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had some influence from the Ahmadiyya movement in what we were taught in the Nation of Islam.  For example, the Qur'ans [Koran] that we were given in the Nation of Islam--I say the Qur'ans meaning the translation of the Qur'an that we were encouraged to read.  It was two; it was Abdullah Yusuf Ali and Muhammad Ali.  And, Muhammad Ali's translation of the Qur'an had some Ahmadiyya influence in it, in this translation.  So there was some influence even then that we weren't taught to read even though we were given Qur'an, we weren't really curious to read it in the days of the Nation of Islam under Elijah Muhammad, we were encouraged to read the Bible.  We were not encouraged to read the Qur'an, we were given the Qur'an.  We were told to take the Qur'an and put it on the shelf and that's what most did.  Most put it on the shelf and most never studied it, they never even opened it up, they did what they were told to do put it on the shelf in a high place.  And, it wasn't until Imam W.D. Mohammed came that we took it down and started studying it, studying the logic of it, studying the language of it, et cetera.  So, Imam W.D. Mohammed--because, because most of us and I say most of us--most African Americans who were Muslims were members of that movement called Nation of Islam and they transitioned from the Nation of Islam to quote, unquote orthodox--you know, this is a term people are familiar with but the way of the, the way of the Qur'an and the way of the prophet to put it more correctly.  We transitioned but we did it under Imam Mohammed's leadership because that was almost the only act in town at that time barring a few, you know, little movements, little people, leaders here and there.  So, now, you know, it's like the Qur'an said, "And they didn't differ until knowledge came to them."  Now, once everybody got a little knowledge now, oh, I don't need Wallace no more, you know, I'm going to go over here and I'm going to be a Shi'ite and I'm going to be, I'm going to be Ahmadiyya, I'm going to be a Salafi, I'm going to be this, I'm going to be that.  So, now everybody--you know, you're free, you be what you want to be, you accept what you want to accept.
Story_ID: 639341
Speaker 1: What I have found and what many of us have found is that under the leadership of Imam W.D. Mohammed [Warith Deen Mohammed], we were given the best teaching, the best explanation of the Qur'an [Koran] and the best explanation of the life of Prophet Muhammad bar none.  That's what we believe, that's what most of believe and accept and many of the scholars because of the esteem that Imam W.D. Mohammed was held in even by the scholars.  In Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Egypt all over the world that we know it wasn't just a repeat of Yakub's history.  Now, we are not talking about Yakub's history; we're talking about high logic, Qur'anic logic that was being imparted to us by Imam W.D. Mohammed.  So, we stayed with him and his leadership, the majority of us.  And, another reason we stayed with him because he always had a balanced approach.  He didn't encourage us toward radicalization or radical, radicalism or extremism, he never encouraged us towards--in that, in that way.  He never encouraged us to disrespect this government and the leadership of this government even if we disagreed with it; to respect the office of the president, to respect the leadership in society, to support it when we saw them trying to advance good.  He held up the flag which was offensive to many Muslims back in the time when he first became the leader.  And he--one of the things he did was he held up the American flag and he said, "If you all won't carry this flag, I will," and he got condemned by many Muslims and particularly in the African American community but the immigrant community also.  Now, since 9/11 [September 11, 2001]--after 9/11, then they start going out buying flags, you, the store couldn't hold enough flags.  They were out look- shopping for flags because they wanted to be seen not as anti-America, I don't want you to come and get me government, you know, I'm American.  You see, I've got my flag but when Imam Mohammed was holding up the flag and telling us to support this country, this nation America and not to see ourselves as outsiders of America but to see ourselves as builders of America that we have to build this nation on our own backs and that we should have a sense of, a sense of respect and dignity for this country which we are part owners of.
Story_ID: 639342
Speaker 1: I remember the change in Muhammad Speaks to the paper--what do they call it, the--?
Speaker 2: It went through several transitions.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's the World Community of Islam. It was the--
Speaker 2: That was the movement--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --but the paper itself became A.M. Journal.
Speaker 1: A.M. Journal, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, A.M. Journal.  And they went through certain transition and now it's called--well, finally it's called Muslim Journal now.
Speaker 1: Yeah, (unclear)--he was calling it--
Speaker 2: The Bilalian News.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Bilalian News.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, and, the movement, the movement was given different names, it went, the World Community of Al Islam in the West, you know, all the way up to American, American Muslim Mission--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --and then finally Imam Mohammed [Warith Deen Mohammed] dropped all the names and the last name that we had which was, I think it was ASM, it was American Muslim, American Society of Muslims, I think it was the last name we had, MAS we had two, Muslim American Society.  The last name that we had, he, the reason he had, he said that he adopted that name is because immigrant Muslims from other countries were warning away to identify him and his following, you know, and that was the only reason but then shortly after that, a few years later he dropped all the names, all the labels.  So, even today in Imam Mohammed's absence, you know he's not physically present, he's passed, we don't have a name.  If you ask me who I am, I'm a Muslim in the international community of Muslims but I also would say I'm an associate of Imam W.D. Mohammed that's what I would say and that's how I would identify myself.
Speaker 1: But he would be revered teacher but not necessarily a leader, I mean a founder or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --maybe he would be, I don't know.
Speaker 2: No, no, it would be, he would be--he's my teacher.  He would be my teacher and my leader but under Prophet Muhammad, under Prophet Muhammad.  We never--
Speaker 1: So, it wouldn't spin you off as a sect or something like that.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: No, because every, every Muslim whether they will admit it or not, they have somebody that has some influence on them and so in a direct way or in an indirect way that person is sort of their teacher and to some degree even their leader.
Story_ID: 639343
Speaker 1: Can you, I guess kind of give us a chronology of, of your development, I guess as a, as a, a fledgling, you know, Muslim, you know, to an imam?
Speaker 2: Okay.  I, If I go back to the days when I was, joined the Nation of Islam very quickly I was encouraged to be a minister at that time we called them ministers and I was reluctant to take on that responsibility because I wasn't that familiar with the, with the religion in terms of knowledge.  And, but their encouragement was that brother we'll help you, you know, we'll help you with the, you know, we'll help you with the knowledge.  You know, just--you know, you've got good leadership skills and you're intelligent and you're this and you're that.  So, anyway when the transition took place and those who were ministers or assistant ministers or whatever, many of them automatically became imams.  I--a certain point I recall, when I was again reluctant because of me now understanding the title imam and the weight that it carries with it--the responsibility that it carries with it.  I didn't want to simply take on that responsibility just because but the--first of all the way that one becomes an imam--the proper way that one should become an imam is by--we don't have this, like this hierarchy or this well for lack of the term I'm looking for the hierarchy where you have people pronouncing you or anointing you as imam.  It comes from the people.  The people look for the one among them who has the best conduct, the good conduct, the character and that's the first criteria.  The first criteria is that you have to have the character, the conduct and then the knowledge, then the knowledge, the second because obviously as an imam just like a preacher or a religious leader in any faith, you have to teach, you have to--our main responsibility is to lead the prayers which for us they are in Arabic.  So, you have to learn the language of Arabic and, you know, of course because most of our members are English speaking people, we have to obviously translate but you have to learn the language of Arabic--Qur'anic Arabic more specifically.  So I became, I was an assistant for a few years under the brother who was the imam before me, James Shabazz [Abdullah H. Abdur Razzaq] who was, had moved here from Newark [New Jersey], he actually was sent here by Imam W.D. Mohammed [Warith Deen Mohammed].  He was asked to come here to Norfolk [Virginia] to be the imam and then I was his assistant, assistant for a number of years and then eventually I became the imam or the resident imam as we would say--the head imam and have been in that position or role of responsibility for a number of years now.
Story_ID: 639344
Speaker 1: I would say over thirty years--more than thirty years and being in the association of Imam W.D. Mohammed [Warith Deen Mohammed], I have been tasked with a lot of responsibilities nationally not only locally but nationally and assumed those responsibilities, taken up those tasks to move the national community, the community from a national standpoint to move us forward in terms of our progress.  Among them I headed the, what is called the mathhab, the school of thought of Imam W.D. Mohammed which was a national and to some degree an international, it had international implications because I was getting calls and letters and inquiries from Muslims abroad from other countries from around the world wanting to know what is this mathhab, the new mathhab or new school of thought in America.  Other (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) How do you spell that mathhab?
Speaker 1: M-A-T-H-H-A-B, mathhab, it means school of thought (background noise).  That's how we would translate it, it means school of thought and that does not--mathhab is never to be promoted or put above the Qur'an [Koran] nor the life example of teachings of the prophet.  So, I have also been tasked with being the like chair of the national convention and prior to Imam Mohammed's passing, I worked along with him, very closely with him and another imam in Chicago [Illinois], Imam Darnell Karim.  We worked on the translation of the Qur'an.  That is the translation, recitation and commentary of the Qur'an.  I was tasked with the translation, Imam Darnell Karim was tasked with the recitation in Arabic and Imam W.D. Mohammed himself did the commentary on the Qur'an.  And we worked as a team on that project up until the time he passed and there are a number of other responsibilities that I've had over the years in his association of national implications, you know.  So it's been a labor of love on the one hand and a challenge on the other hand.  A lot of, lot of sacrifices on family and personal ambitions.  You know, you have to sacrifice a lot of things to be in this position of responsibility, you know.  In the local area I have been blessed to be very active and respected.  I try to give respect and I think that has brought us the respect from a lot of leaders in the area, Christian leaders, Jewish leaders, political leaders and so on and so forth.  They call on us; we've been invited to participate in a lot of significant efforts and causes that we again are pleased and humbled to have been asked to be involved in.
Story_ID: 639345
Speaker 1: The only thing I would ask you to do right now is maybe to be more--give, give us some specific examples because I've got some---
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --you know, that, that you serve on a number of committees here--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and a lot of the committees have to do with understanding and a dialogue between the different faiths.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: We started a group some years ago called Act, A-C-T, Abraham's Children Together and it was primarily a group of Christians, Muslims and Jews.  I was one of the founding members of that group and we did dialogue, we had interfaith dialogue presentations from the different faith perspectives and we'd invite people to come out and be a part of that effort.  There was another effort called NEXUS that I'm still involved in, N-E-X-U-S, nexus meaning connections and that op- we function, we operate out of I should say Virginia Wesleyan College here [Virginia Wesleyan University, Norfolk, Virginia] and again is a interfaith group and we sponsor, we sponsor panel discussions for the most part at Virginia Wesleyan College.  Most of them take place at Virginia Wesleyan College and, but the spectrum is larger than just Muslims, Christians and Jews, Hindus and Buddhists and others are included in that.  I serve on the Norfolk Education Foundation [Norfolk, Virginia] which is a group of community leaders, business leaders and political leaders, et cetera.  And our responsibility is to help raise funds for Norfolk Public Schools.  To assist teachers and students with funds for programs and initiatives that they, when they don't have the money coming through the budget, their budget, you know, and if they have a particular project that they want to do and there is no money in the budget to fund that then they apply for grants through Norfolk Education Foundation with us. I also am the chair of the Tidewater Chapter of Virginia Center for Inclusive Communities [Richmond, Virginia].  That organization was originally founded as NCCJ, National Conference of Christians and Jews and over the years it's changed its name, it's gone through a transition and it's now called VCIC, Virginia Center for Inclusive Communities.  I received the Humanitarian Award, a great honor some years ago from that organization for work that I'm doing and I now serve as the chair of the Tidewater Chapter, I serve on the state board.  A few years ago we were blessed to be invited by Senator Yvonne Miller [Yvonne B. Miller] to give the opening invocation for the Virginia Senate [Senate of Virginia] which was a first.  For--it was, I was the second Muslim to do it but I was the first African American Muslim to give the invocation at the Virginia Senate.  The first Muslim was an immigrant, immigrant Muslim, woman, woman by the way.  So there's a lot of things that I'm involved in, in the community locally and have been involved in for a number of years.  And I see all of this as a part of my role as imam.  My role as imam and leader is not just confined to these four walls and, and teaching people Islam, you know.
Story_ID: 639346
Speaker 1: Some years ago right after 9/11 [September 11, 2001], they had an interfaith group--they called together an interfaith group to have a, a big interfaith prayer service at the convention center downtown.  I was the Muslim that they called, they asked to be a part of that organizing group--committee.  We had a successful prayer service, interfaith prayer service, big event.  I have on tap right now, this month a lot of speaking engagements.  Every week we've been except well, I say one weekend we were without any invitations but every other weekend in this month, one coming up, one we just had last week at a twelve hundred member church in Virginia Beach [Virginia], Pastor Andy Meade's church, I can't recall the name of his church, Vineyard, Vineyard Community Church.  On the 23rd of this month I'm scheduled to be with Pastor Michael Simone at Spring Branch Community Church [Virginia Beach, Virginia] and he has a large congregation about two thousand members and he and I have worked together on--through the years so it's not a new relationship, it's not like a onetime thing.  He and I have been working together on things in the community for a number of years.  And, so a few months ago he approached me and asked to interview me at his, for his service, his main service on Sunday.  He has two services 'cause of the size of his congregation, one at nine [o'clock] and one at 11:15 I believe and the whole service, both services are going to be comprised of interviewing me about Islam, about our religion.  It will be taped, there will be streaming, there will be recording, opportunities for people to call and ask questions et cetera.  But one of the things that he wants to do with it he told me is that he wants to use it for his class because he teaches at Saint Leo's University [Saint Leo University, Saint Leo, Florida] and he teaches a class on world religions.  And he interviewed a rabbi about five years ago, a rabbi whom I know about five years for the same purpose.  And he uses the DVD recording from that to, for his students when it comes to Judaism he just gives them that video.  So he has said that he would do that same thing--he wants to do the same thing with this.  He wants to use what he learns from the interview that he conducts with us to share with his students in his class.
Story_ID: 639347
Speaker 1: There's one thing I wanted to ask you about that's really on everybody's minds these days is that I, I know as we sit here today there are some fundamental radical sects of not only Islam--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --but Christianity and Islam too--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that are blowing things up and doing things around the country (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly.
Speaker 1: --you know.  We've got the right wing Christians blowing up abortion clinics, we've got, you know--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --right wing Zionists--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --doing whatever they do in the Middle East but the world seems or at least American media seems very concerned with fundamental Islamic--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --groups and violence of bombings--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and that sort of thing, terror and you are, I know you work with the FBI's [Federal Bureau of Investigation] multicultural task force.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Is that to--how does it--well, just tell us about it.
Speaker 2: Okay.  The multicultural board, FBI multicultural board, advisory board is what it's called that I'm a part of they--previous to FBI they are called SACs, S-A-C, special agent in charge then I call the director because the director is in D.C. [Washington, D.C].  We have had relationships with them, cordial relationships with them to the extent that we could work with them we try to do it.  But this present director--I mean special agent in charge that they have now he's been more, he's been more open about, I would say reaching out to not only myself but to community leaders and involving them in advising them on areas where we can be of mutual help to one another, you know.  We're helping them and they're also trying to help us in areas where we need help and assistance.  So that's the idea, the idea is to have a mutual cooperation.  By me being a member of that advisory board, I know one of the things that they were looking for from me--I know some of the things that they are looking for from me and I'm willing to do it to the extent that I can.  One of the things that we have been able to do is to bring together the leaders in this area--the Muslims leaders in this area and to have them to meet with the FBI, we did that a few months ago.  Have them to all sit down and meet with the FBI and to get familiar with them, kind of break the ice so to speak and what we agreed to do was to have them to go to each mosque or each masjid to give a presentation and to apprise the people there of what they do as an agency and to ask questions.  You know, they can, they are open to ask the hard questions.  If you go back to the Nation of Islam, the Nation of Islam has had a rocky relationship with the FBI. We know that history and many other organizations have had especially in the black communities have had a rocky relationship with the FBI.  So there was, you know, obviously some concern there but anyway we are who we are now.  So from that we agreed to have them to come to each mosque, each masjid to give a presentation.  They are going to be here [Norfolk, Virginia] in June God willing.  We have already come up with a date; in fact, I'm--this is breaking news CNN (laughter). They're going to be coming here in next month and doing a presentation here then from that we hope to have a town meeting, a town, like a town hall type meeting with all the Muslims in the area.  Now one of things I asked him was is this being done in other cities around the country and he said to me, he said, "Very few places, very few places because the agent, the special agent in charge has some degree of flexibility to, to do these kinds of things if they want to and just fortunately we have one now who has decided to do this."
Story_ID: 639348
Speaker 1: I was just interviewed this morning by the, the gentleman you spoke with, Leonard Colvin [Leonard E. Colvin] he interviewed me this morning for the, for the article in the paper [New Journal and Guide] on this very subject and he asked me what did I think was causing Muslims to become radicalized, you know, quote, unquote radicalized in this day and time.  And I told him there a number of factors.  I said, "Well first let me approach it like this. First, I think that there is a cause and a cause--the causes, there are several causes.  One being the way particularly immigrant Muslims feel about American foreign policy.  There's also certain anger and frustration with a feeling of helplessness by some that we can't get justice, you know, we can't get the right proper treatment.  So then after you deal with the cause--what's causing people to react like that then you look at what comes next.  It's positions and dispositions.  They take positions and they take on dispositions and then the last thing that they do is respond and react.  Unfortunately, their response and their reaction is contrary to what is espoused in our sacred scripture the Qur'an [Koran] and contrary to what the prophet himself would tell any of us to do, it is against the religion.  For example, the Qur'an says do not commit suicide, it's plain, it's clear and you don't need to be a scholar to understand it.  So in the prisons it's become a breeding ground for so called radicalization of Muslims because you also have the fact of lack of education, lack of," I said, "lack of education, not only academically education but more specifically education or knowledge of the Qur'an, the scripture and the religion itself, lack, lacking in that.  Some cases you have the individual who's lacking in both.  They're lacking academic education, they're ignorant and they are also lacking or ignorant of the religious teachings but because of anger and frustration and sometimes just loneliness, just wanting to do something.  Sometimes people want to be seen so bad that they will do things that are stupid and ignorant just to be seen."  So there are various reasons why people quote, unquote become radicalized and give themselves to extremism like some unfortunately are doing.  So I again I thank God for the leadership of Imam W.D. Mohammed [Warith Deen Mohammed] because it's been his balance and sober approach to the teaching of Islam that and if it were not perhaps, if it not perhaps--what this country needs to understand if it were not for that sober and balanced leadership and thinking that that man left with many of us that many of us would have taken on that kind of attitude that we had in the '60s [1960s] in the, in the days of oppression and, you know, Jim Crow-ism et cetera and then brought, carried it right into Islam and been radical and been doing some maybe extreme things too.  So, fortunately we are not there. We're balanced, we, we, we support America, we support this country, we reject anybody who's killing particularly innocent people in the name of our religion Islam.
Story_ID: 639349
Speaker 1: Tell me now how has the, the, I guess the merging of the former Nation of Islam members, how, how has it been in terms of the joining the world community of Muslims?  I know in the beginning some things I was reading in the, in the late '70s [1970s] were about some movements from other countries, you know, rejecting the idea of Americans being--you all don't know enough yet.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Was that, so was that--how has that, how has that transitioned?
Speaker 2: Well, let me (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --let me go back to a meeting that we had in Chicago [Illinois] some years ago.  I think it was in, around, around 1983, we had a meeting in Chicago a big meeting at the Palmer House Hotel [Palmer House Hilton] and this meeting was organized and paid for by the Saudis, the Saudis.  I mean they actually paid for everything, our plane tickets, hotels and everything.  And a lot of the leaders, imams and leaders from not only America but from all over America and from many parts of the world, we converged at the Palmer House Hotel.  And present there was [HistoryMaker] Minister Louis Farrakhan, Imam W.D. Mohammed [Warith Deen Mohammed], Imam Siraj Wahhaj and scholars from Mecca [Saudi Arabia], from Canada, from all over the world.  I mentioned those three for a reason but they were from all over the world.  And, the concern, one of the concerns that came out in that meeting was for, was about Minister Farrakhan and the concern was that, was this, they didn't have this concern about Imam W.D. Mohammed, they had this concern for Minister Farrakhan.  They say, "You say that you are Muslim but you are teaching things that are contrary to the religion.  So how can you say you're Muslim?"  Now, you know how eloquent Minister Farrakhan is so, you know, he had a comeback and he condemned them for being here in America, being Muslim and their names was Joe, Yusuf over there, and they changed it to Joe when they got here.  The name was Muhammad over there and they changed it to Moe when they got here and so he was condemning them for coming here and being here and knowing the religion of Islam and not coming to the black community and teaching us Islam.  So he said to them, "So you think I'm going to reject the Honorable Elijah Muhammad, the man who brought me to some form of this religion?"  And, then he went on to say, "Well, you want to know what Minister Farrakhan believes? Farrakhan believes this, Farrakhan believes the Qur'an [Koran] is the holy book, he believes Prophet Muhammad is the last prophet, et cetera."  So he said some things that Muslims don't argue with, they don't argue with that.  So that got them off of his back but it really wasn't until Imam W.D. Mohammed came up, everybody wanted to know what do you say Imam W.D. Mohammed.  When I, when I say this I mean the scholars from the East, from Mecca, from Canada from all over they want to know okay Imam W.D. Mohammed you know Minister Farrakhan, you know what he is teaching here in America and you know what he said and you know the religion.  So what do you say about what he just said and what do you think about him?  And imam said this, he said, "Minister Farrakhan says that he is a Muslim.  He says that we should leave him alone and let him prove himself to be that or otherwise not to be that.  Let him prove through his own actions, his own life that he is or is not what he says he is but leave him alone and everybody just kind of--the, the wind came, came out of everybody's sail because I mean, yeah, because you could, you could feel the tension in that room, you know.
Story_ID: 639350
Speaker 1: To kind of fast forward a little bit on this same subject, Muslims--what we are finding is contrary, the, the, the attitude and thinking that they had about many of us, blacks, African Americans that we don't know the religion.  You're not Muslims; you're not bona fide because you don't know the religion yet.  Now what we're finding is that they don't know the religion.  We're finding that they speak Arabic and many people even many Muslims are deceived into thinking that they know the religion because they speak Arabic.  See that's their language, they speak Arabic.  But Qur'anic Arabic and spoken Arabic, colloquial Arabic is two different things.  So they don't, and I'm not saying all of them but many of them do not know the Qur'an [Koran].  Many of them do not know the life and teachings of the Prophet Muhammad and if, and I, and I hate to, hate to blanket, use blanket condemnations because that's not my intent but when we look at what is happening in terms of these terrorist acts and then these attitudes and dispositions that many of them have taken.  It's proof that either they don't know or they are, they refuse to teach what is right and I do believe too there is some criticism, is on the backs of the scholars in the Middle East who know the religion, who know the religion and they are not vocal enough.  Now unlike in America, we don't control the media.  When I'm on these panel discussions one of the questions I always get is, "Imam, where is the voice of the moderate Muslims?"  That's what, that's one of the questions I always get.  "Where is the voice of the moderate Muslims?  We don't hear you all speaking out about terrorism.  We don't hear you condemning these terrorist acts.  Where is the voice of the moderate Muslims?"  And what I say to them is this, we don't own CNN, we don't own ABC, we don't own NBC, we don't own Time Warner magazine [sic. Time Inc.], we don't own The Washington Post, New York Times [The New York Times], Atlanta Constitution [Atlanta Journal Constitution], you know, we don't own any of these major forms of media and, but you own them.  Some of you, your people, they own them.  If you're looking for a moderate voice you know, they know where to find a moderate voice, they are not interested in a moderate voice.  They are interested in a voice of controversy because controversy drives the newspaper, controversy sells magazines and controversy makes the ratings go up on the television station not a moderate Muslim sitting there condemning, condemning terrorism, you know.  And if you wanted to find one, we're all around the country and particularly you will find them among the following of the Imam W.D. Mohammed [Warith Deen Mohammed].
Story_ID: 639351
Speaker 1: What's up next for you in terms of your own personal projects--
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in terms of writing or--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --travel?
Speaker 2: Well, the project that we, the major project that I have before me right now that--with the major projects that I have before me that I am working on and hope to complete.  The first one is the project that we began with Imam W.D. Mohammed [Warith Deen Mohammed].  Imam Darnell Karim who is still in Chicago [Illinois] and myself, we have not shied away from that project not one degree.  We got away from it for a little bit after Imam Mohammed passed 'cause we, you know, we just had to take a break, you know, but we are, we continue our work.  I am--my work in that project is to research, to compile the translation as rendered by Imam W.D. Mohammed.  So it's not my translation, the translation would be the translation of Imam W.D. Mohammed.  I am the one who is doing the research, I am the one who is doing the compiling of his translation and to the extent that he had instructed me, said to me, "When you see a problem here and there," one of the things he told me to do for example, is take out all the old English language.  You know, most of the translations that we have now they are translations for English speaking people but they are not translations for the American audience.  And some people might not understand that there's a difference there but there's a need for a translation of the Qur'an [Koran] for the American English speaking audience.  So the old English language like thou and begetest and that's one of the things, all of that is automatically coming out.  I'm also a student of the Qur'an and the language of the Qur'an myself.  So I feel that, I'm certain that if Imam Mohammed would not have entrusted that responsibility with me if he didn't trust some judgment on my part to make some decisions regarding, you know, this translation.  But by and large the translation will be that of Imam W.D. Mohammed based on my compiling and researching and compiling.  And then we also--there's a separate group of us who are working on the commentary.  Again, now that Imam Mohammed is passed his commentary has to be researched and we have a lot of it in writing and we just have to kind of put it in some kind of order, you know, research it and put it in some kind of order.  His commentary on the Qur'an meaning, will lack a meaning more than a translation, it's called tafsir, T-A-F-S-I-R, tafsir, which is commentary on the Qur'an as opposed to translation or a rendering of the Qur'an.  So I'm working also on that with a few of the imams, a few, small group of us are working on that.  We have some things that we want to accomplish here, some short terms goals and long term goals as a community here at Masjid William Salaam [Norfolk, Virginia].  We had been working on a theater project until the economy kind of took its turn.  We felt the need for cultural revival, for us to have venues for cultural expression.  Not that kind of raunchy stuff that we're hearing a lot of today from some of the young artists, I won't say all of them but from some of them.  But a more refined and dignified cultural expressions.  So we felt the need to have a venue where they could have these kinds of expressions and Imam Mohammed was coming here on a pretty fairly regular basis to support me and us here in trying to secure, in fact there are a couple of theaters right here in this block that have been here, historical theaters right down the street here, one right here on the corner that we were trying to secure and to rehab and bring them back alive as venues for cultural expressions.  So that's kind of been put on hold.  We have some business efforts in trying to acquire property, in fact we have acquired some property that we will be renovating real soon and putting businesses in those, in that, in that facility, one right in the next block, in fact.  And, so there are a number of projects in, in that area, in, in those areas.
Story_ID: 639352
Speaker 1: Just a few, a few short years ago completed a revised and enhanced edition of the earlier book that I had put out.  A prayer book called 'Uniformity in Prayer' [Vernon Fareed] and again that was another project that was initiated primarily by Imam W.D. Mohammed [Warith Deen Mohammed].  It was associated with the mathhab, school of thought.  He said that all of us should be praying alike when it comes to basic devotions, you know, we should be uniformed in the basic devotions.  So when we had that meeting in Cleveland [Ohio], that meeting, that national meeting of the, of the school of thought that was his instruction to us that we uniform, become uniform in our devotions.  And, so we needed to produce publications.  So the first prayer book that I did, I was, I was never pleased with that so I have since produced another prayer book a few years ago as more comprehensive, it's more colorful and et cetera.  It's enhanced over and above the first one I put out.  So I have a number of other books and publications.  My wife [Swiyyah K. Fareed] and I, we are committed to work on a book on marriage.  She's, she has her master's in social work and she's working on her Ph.D.  Very soon in fact, just, very close to getting her Ph.D. in social work.  And, so she will lend her expertise or her knowledge as a mother, as a wife and as a professional to that publication and I will lend, I don't have very much experience (laughter) and so I just have to lend, I have to lend knowledge from the religion and, and, and we will together, God willing produce a book on marriage.  So there are a couple of publications that I want to, want to complete.
Story_ID: 639353
Speaker 1: I've been asked by our observers to ask you about international travel.  You've apparently done some international travel.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  I've been blessed again to do quite a bit of international travel.  I, again I can't recall, recall all the dates and everything, the years but some years ago--well, first I was blessed to go to hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca [Saudi Arabia].  I do recall that was in 1996 and prior, prior to going to Mecca, I went to Morocco and we visited a lot of places there in Morocco: Fez, Marrakesh, Beni Mellal, Casablanca and, you know, had a chance to visit some of the historical places and cities and sights in Morocco.  And we went to Mecca and Medina [Saudi Arabia] where I went to hajj.  I performed the rites of pilgrimage in 1996 in which it was a highlight of my being a Muslim and I think for any Muslim to be able to go to Mecca and make the pilgrimage to hajj, the hajj is certainly one of the most astounding things that we can experience as a human being when you meet people from all over the world of every color, speaking every language conceivable on earth, you know.  So that was a great blessing.
Story_ID: 639354
Speaker 1: Since been to Rome [Italy] as a part of a delegation representing Imam W.D. Mohammed [Warith Deen Mohammed] and our national community.  We went to Rome and we visited the, the Vatican [Vatican City] and, you know, inside, toured everything and had a treatment and relationship with a group called the Focolare [Focolare Movement].  The Focolare are a group of--it was founded by a lady named Chiara Lubich and she is a, she is deceased now.  And she's a, but she's the, member of the Catholic faith but she saw a need to be, I guess a little bit more aggressive when it came to promoting peace and love, spreading love and peace even interfaith dialogue.  So her organization which was a world, became a worldwide organization under the Catholic, the umbrella of Catholicism.  She had followings in various places all over the world.  Well, her community and the community of Imam W.D. Mohammed forged a bond and a relationship which meant that there was a lot of exchange, you know, us going to Rome and they coming here, in fact a lot of the members here--in fact they have a good, a good sizable community there in Chicago [Illinois] right around the area where Minister Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan] lives, you know, and where Barack Obama's, [HistoryMaker] President Barack Obama's home is in that area.  They have a, a home right there.
Story_ID: 639355
Speaker 1: Imam Mohammed [Warith Deen Mohammed] was planning to go on this trip to Turkey as a, a, a part of a delegation under his following and he passed before it could happen, take place and there again I was fortunate--my wife [Swiyyah K. Fareed] and I--there were eleven of us altogether who were chosen, selected or whatever to represent Imam Mohammed in his absence as a part of our national community.  So we went to Turkey and we got, I would say, royal treatment and the treatment was afforded to us because they were, they told us they were giving us the treatment that they would have given to Imam W. Mohammed himself.  We are on tap to travel to Sydney, Australia later this year God willing to, for the same purpose.  It was a trip that I had kind of set up for Imam Mohammed for him to go to Turkey I mean, I'm sorry, Sydney, Australia with some Muslims there who are, in fact the way it came about is that this particular person in Sydney is working on a translation of Qur'an [Koran] and I was, I was referred to him, he was referred to me through a woman, a Muslim woman who's doing her Ph.D. thesis on translations of the Qur'an and someone told her about me.  She got in touch with me; she then in turn put me in touch with this Muslim in Sydney, Australia.  So we began to communicate, before you know it was, a trip was set up for Imam Mohammed to go to Sydney, Australia along with myself and Imam Darnell Karim.  The three of us were working on that project and he passed before that could happen.  So, obviously that was taken off the table.  Since then I have been contacted and they told me that they want to put it back on the table.  There are plans from what they tell me to give an honor, to present an honor to me posthumously for Imam W.D. Mohammed.  Some type of a medallion, and I don't know what it is but some type of honor but it's a two week, it will be speaking engagements to government officials, business leaders, schools and, as well as mosques there when we go.  And, again that's something that's planned for August, August of this year.
Story_ID: 639356
Speaker 1: When you look back at everything you've done to this point, is there anything that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think a lot of things I would do (laughter) differently.  Yeah, I think there are a lot of things I would do differently, but I think that overall what, my faults or my mistakes that I have personally made and I'm saying that to say I'm separating, I'm making a distinction between some decisions that were not the best decisions that I have made myself in terms of how my life has borne itself out in contrast to the hand of God on my life or over my life.  I think that overall the way my life has turned out in the end, you know, I have found myself in places and situations and among people that sometimes I pinch myself and say, "How did I get here?"  You know, from my humble beginnings, knowing my beginning, knowing where I came from, knowing my roots, my foundation, et cetera.  And I say to myself, "How did you get here?"  And I say that with a great sense of humbleness and a great sense of respect and appreciation for God guiding me and helping me with my life.  So, yeah there are few things that I certainly would make better choices and decisions about but I think that in a strange way even the bad decisions that I have made that God--because God's hand was on my life and guiding me towards a destiny that I didn't even know about that it has in a strange way helped to get me to where I needed to go.
Story_ID: 639357
Speaker 1: Once again when you look back over the entire span of what you've done to this point what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I think my legacy is that I have been, become a great follower because you can't be a good leader unless you're a good follower and so I would put the fact that I have become a good follower.  I learned how to follow and learning how to follow and I put more emphasis on following than I do on being a leader and the fact that I have concentrated on being a good follower in the eyes of some, I have become a good leader and I think that's my legacy.
Story_ID: 639358
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: I would, I would hope that the black community, our people, African Americans can overcome ignorance and I, and I'm not just talking about academics, learning how to read and write, I'm talking about ignorant behavior culturally speaking.  I would hope that we can take on more dignified culture in all respects, and I'm talking about culture in its broadest sense. Food that we eat, what we put in our minds, what clothes we put on our back, what we give ourselves to the lifestyle, the life, life's issues, things that we give ourselves to.  I would hope that we can rise to a level of dignity like we once had in our past life; I would say our ancestors and even our fore parents here in America even.  Though they may not have had the wherewithal in terms of money or prestige or positions of power but they had dignity, they had dignity and if we can, if our people as a whole can just go back to having that sense of dignity and respect for life and for each other, I think we will have arrived, you know.  And more so than money because a lot of our people now are making money, they're making large amounts of money and I recall Imam W.D. Mohammed [Warith Deen Mohammed] saying one time about people such as, and he wasn't saying specifically, but he used "such as"- Dr. Bill Cosby and others who have made large amounts, accumulated large amounts of wealth but when they--Reverend Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] with his prestige, et cetera.  When they were invited to the White House [Washington, D.C.], you know, in, particularly in past administrations when you, when you go there, if you go there with, without a people behind you who are established then you go there almost like empty.  You go there, you've got money, you've got prestige, you have--you're educated and you have popularity and all this but your people are largely unestablished and your people are culturally deprived so for one of us, for any one of us, for any ten thousand of us to quote, unquote arrive and the rest of us are in this deprived and degregated state is not enough.  So my hope and prayer is that all of us will rise up to a level of dignity and respect particularly when it comes to cultural expression in its broadest sense and then I think we will have arrived.
Story_ID: 639359
Speaker 1: I thought of this as we were talking, the, the, the recent trouble in Nigeria over the, the, the violence against Christians in Jos, Nigeria and the institution of sharia law--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in northern Nigeria, do you think that--what are your thoughts about separation of church and state or religion and secular, you know, the sacred and secular--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --in regards to, you know, laws that we follow every day?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, first let me address it from the Qur'anic standpoint--from a religious standpoint.  In our religion there is no separation of church and state, it's one.  In the situation that Muslims are in for example, in America we have, obviously have to have separation of church and state and because the [U.S.] Constitution and, you know, what it says, you can't establish a religion, et cetera.  And which is this pluralistic society, this multi religious society that we can all live here in peace and we, but we still all have the freedom to practice our religion as long as we do it in a peaceful manner and a lawful manner.  I think that when it comes to sharia, when it comes to sharia, one of the things that many Muslims don't understand is that sharia is regional.  Sharia, there's no sharia coming out of Saudi Arabia to dictate how we conduct affairs here in America, for example, you know, even though they would want that.  They might want that, they might want to impose, or impose that on us or to make us believe or think that we have to accept their sharia.  Sharia is Islamic law, it's Qur'anic law.  It's not, it's Qur'anic law.  Sharia, the sharia are laws that are extracted from the Qur'an [Koran]--they are not these laws that these quote, unquote scholars are making up that when you condemn a woman, for example for committing adultery you kill the woman and you let the man live, you know, that's not sharia, that's something you made, you made up.  The word sharia means street and I'm not on the same street that they're on.  I don't accept to be on the same street as they're on.  That's what sharia means, sharia literally means street just like 35th Street.  So we're not on the same street that they're on and we have no desire to be on the same street that they're on unless the sharia are the laws that they are embracing are extracted from the Qur'an with support from the Qur'an and they are applicable to my situation here in America, I can't accept their sharia.  So when it comes to Nigeria or any other place in the world their sharia is regional, local and regional and the application of it has to be contingent upon the circumstances in that particular environment and many Muslims don't understand this.  So they want to--the scholars give a fatwa, you know, a religious ruling or rendering and it comes out of Egypt or it comes out of Pakistan.
Speaker 1: Well, you know how the media portrays it as all Muslims are putting a fatwa on someone (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, and that's not the case.  See there, this goes with--see if I was to look at the fatwa that they have given on, for example killing people because and not that we appreciate or like people saying things, bad things about Prophet Muhammad but I'm not, I'm not supposed to go out and kill somebody, I'm not supposed to put a bounty on somebody's head because they did that, you know.  I can disagree with them and I can let them know, you know, we don't appreciate that, we think that is disrespectful, you know, and those kinds of things but to kill, to put a bounty on a person's head simply because they said something degrading about Prophet Muhammad, and that offends us as Muslims.  Just as if something was said negative about Jews--the Jewish faith or the Christians and their faith or great figures or doctrines that they hold sacred, it would offend them the same way that it offends us.  But for them to issue a fatwa like that and expect us to accept it, no we don't accept it because it is not consistent with the Qur'an and it's not consistent with what Prophet Muhammad himself taught and the way he lived his life.  So the situation in Nigeria where they are instituting this so called sharia and if it's, if it's not just, if it's not fair, if it's not Qur'anically based we can't accept it and I, and I, I can't take it apart item for item or line by line because I don't, I don't, I don't have it before me to take it apart like that.

Speaker 1: Is there anything I haven't asked you that you think you want to address before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: (Makes sound) Well, is there anything I want to address?  Is that, is that, is that the question (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, is there any question you think we ought to address--that you want to address before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That I might have forgot to say or didn't, couldn't think of what to say.
Speaker 2: Well, I don't want to, I don't want to ask the question. I want to make a comment.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I want to--the comment that I want to make is that we and I appreciate The HistoryMakers for taking the time to even consider a Muslim in this environment, this climate that is in the world today with all the negative stuff that we hear in the media regarding Muslims and when I, when I reflect on what is happening right now as you and I sit here and talk, I look at myself and I say, I'm a Muslim but I'm also an African American, you know.  I'm a human being, I'm contributing to society, I'm, and I say I and I don't mean that I as the big I but we are making positive contributions to society just like other people are making.  So why should our efforts be overlooked and not documented, not talked about, et cetera?  But the fact that The HistoryMakers have chosen to do this, I want you to know, we want you to know that we appreciate it and we, including myself, feel honored by it.
Speaker 1: Well, thank you.  Well, the last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as a person who gave my best and that's it.  I gave my best, I put my best foot forward and I tried to obey God, obey His messenger and do the best that I could do by humanity.
