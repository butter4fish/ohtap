Speaker 1: So we're going to start out by asking you about your mother.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay. Can you give her name and what you know--her year of birth and what you know about her growing up?
Speaker 2: Um-hm. Pearline Mitchell Smith [Pearline Jackson Smith]. She's still alive, 1925, September 9th. I was born on her birthday. And she grew up in Mitchellville, Maryland, two siblings, and a challenging family life, although very bright, valedictorian of her high school. She attended Howard University [Washington, D.C.] for a couple of months, decided to drop out, got married and had children after--lots of kids in close succession. Finally, one of my sisters, the oldest one, finally said one day, "When are you going to stop bringing babies home?" A lot of, a lot of children, and--
Speaker 1: How many?
Speaker 2: All together seven and was challenged with so many children. My parents were divorced when I was five years old, and I had a wonderful relationship with my father [Ignatius Mitchell, Jr.] even though my parents were divorced, and my mother worked many, many, many jobs. And as a result, I was really raised more by my two older sisters, Diane [Diane Mitchell Hill] and Kathy [Kathy Mitchell Weaver], were wonderful, wonderful ment- mentors and role models. That's who really, really raised me and gave me a real sense of being able to accomplish an awful lot.
Speaker 1: So what, what were--what was--can we have the siblings in, in order?
Speaker 2: Sure. The oldest one, Diane, who recently deceased at the age of seventy. My next sister is Kathy, she will be sixty-eight this year, and she is a--for many years, a healthcare executive, and now is working in the City of Newark [New Jersey] with an organization called the Newark Alliance, trying to really promote the city with business and industry. I have a--the next one is my brother Eric [Eric Mitchell], who is sixty-six. He's a orthopedic surgeon, St. Joe's undergrad [St. Joseph's University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], U Penn medical school [University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine; Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], and he is semiretired doing some business things now, but orthopedic surgeon for many years, specializing in sports medicine. And I'm next, and after me is my sister Vicki [Vicki Mitchell Pendleton], Vicki is fifteen months younger than me, and she has a master's degree in social work, master's degree in divinity, does practice some--with some churches, more of a--what should I say? A--sort of a informal religious adviser, and also a life coach for people as well. And then the next sibling is a brother, Peter [Peter Mitchell], who graduated from Seton Hall law school [Seton Hall University School of Law, Newark, New Jersey], has done some legal work, lawyer. He's now living in--kind of semiretired living in Tampa, Florida. And the baby is a physician, pediatrician, Dr. Lauren Smith [Lauren A. Smith], Harvard undergrad [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], University of California San Francisco medical school [University of California San Francisco School of Medicine, San Francisco, California], M.P.H., master's in public health from Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California]. In fact, most recently, she was the chief doctor for the State of Massachusetts, with Deval Patrick [HistoryMaker Deval L. Patrick], chief medical director. And she is very, very, very smart physician, doing a lot of things right now with infant mortality, so that's the lineup.
Speaker 1: So, I mean, the, the children did well then.
Speaker 2: Really did very well (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, um-hm.
Story_ID: 667131
Speaker 1: How far do you know on your mother's [Pearline Jackson Smith] background? I mean, how far back, do you--?
Speaker 2: Not really that far back to be very honest with you (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What about grandparents?
Speaker 2: My--both of--my paternal grandmother [Helen Young Mitchell] died when I was very, very, very, very young, very young, so although--
Speaker 1: Your maternal.
Speaker 2: Paternal.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My paternal grandmother died--my maternal grandmother [Pearl Jackson] lived much longer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Paternal grandmother died. I had no knowledge of her. I don't have--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --any recollection really of her.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Except for a fascinating article in The Washington Post that ran about twenty-five years ago, and it's a fascinating story because there was a young African American artist, he was in his twenties, and he went around the neighborhood asking people if they would be willing to pose for him so he would have, you know, subjects, and he wanted to paint what he called 'A Dignified Woman' [ph.], and my paternal grandmother was selected, so we have this great picture of her now in my, in my family room in--at my house in New Jersey. And it's this wonderful picture of my paternal grandmother, and it was the subject of an article in a few art magazines, but The Washington Post really liked it because it was such a special portrait, and the young man that, that painted it, ended up dying of alcoholism. He never realized how talented he really, really was. But what was interesting is that the painting was on loan to the Corcoran museum of art in Washington [Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.], and it got caught up in a collection, and it was sold, and The Washington Post showed this beautiful portrait, and my father [Ignatius Mitchell, Jr.] and his three siblings posing with it and saying, "Isn't this wonderful? This is in our family now." Well, it was included in a collection, as I said, that was sold, and my husband, who was trying a case in Washington, D.C. saw The Washington Post article, and he thought, isn't that great? Well, when it disappeared from the Corcoran, my husband decided to go back to The Washington Post's writer and say, "Do you know what happened to it? Can you help us figure out?" So they did a little research, and they found out the collection had been purchased by BET [Black Entertainment Television], the former president of BET.
Speaker 1: Oh (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Bob--
Speaker 1: --Bob Johnson [Robert L. Johnson].
Speaker 2: --Johnson, Bob Johnson. So Ted [HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.] does all this research, and he goes and says to Bob, "Bob, you have something in the collection that you acquired that belongs to Nina's [HistoryMaker Nina M. Wells] family." He goes, "Really?" He said, "Yep, it was inappropriately included when you bought a whole collection there." He says, "Well, tell me which one it is, and we'll go and we'll see which one." And he looked at the inventory. He goes, "Yes, 'A Dignified Woman.'" He goes, "It's in there." So he said, "Well, what's the fair market value? May we buy it?" And he goes, "Absolutely." Ted made all the arrangements. We had a family reunion, and Ted surprised us and had it shipped to the house, and my relatives--my older siblings remembered it because--and they remembered the article, and here we are. I'm sorry we're not in my house right now, and I'd show you 'A Dignified Woman' (laughter). So that's my knowledge of my paternal grandmother (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That is, that's beautiful.
Speaker 2: And you should see the way, she was very religious.
Speaker 1: Now, paternal. But that's your--
Speaker 2: Paternal.
Story_ID: 667132
Speaker 1: We're talking about maternal.
Speaker 2: My maternal (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --grandmother--
Speaker 1: Not no--you--
Speaker 2: --lived much longer and I did know her. She died when I was in college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I knew my maternal grandmother, and she really assisted my mother [Pearline Jackson Smith] in caring for us. In fact, she had a wonderful, wonderful house in Mitchellville, Maryland, no electricity, outhouse, but we loved going out there. In the summers, you'd go out there with all your cousins, and you would pump water and bring the water into the house, pick--she--my grandmother would say, "Go pick me some blackberries, I'll make you a blackberry pie." She would get the chicken in the yard. Snap the neck off, and you had the most wonderful fried chicken. I remember a big piece of ice being delivered for the old fashioned icebox, and the old fashion phonograph (gesture), right? Phonograph, and we would, you know, turn it up. But mostly what you did was, you hung out, you told stories--this was when I was very young. Fond, fond memories of being out there. You weren't crazy about the outhouse, (laughter) but everything else was pretty cool. But no electricity, and she sold that house, and--when they were coming out--the developers were coming, and she resisted for a while. Then finally the, the amount was such that she said, "Oh, this is my retirement," and she sold the house. It was a beautiful piece of property in Mitchellville, Maryland--
Speaker 1: Now, what was her (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) that was just gorgeous.
Speaker 1: --what was her name?
Speaker 2: Pearl Jackson.
Speaker 1: Pearl Jackson, okay.
Speaker 2: Pearl Jackson.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Pearl Victoria Jackson.
Speaker 1: --so your--did your mother talk about growing up at all?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did. And it was usually pretty--it was a difficult, it was a dif- very difficult environment. My father [Ignatius Mitchell, Jr.] was eleven years older than my mother, and I think, to sort of extricate herself from her personal circumstances, she decided to marry my father who was eleven years older, and then right after they got married, he went and, and--it was World War II [WWII], and he went off to, to war, and when he came back--he was a master sergeant, when he came back, their relationship really was challenged.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Within, you know, a few years of my birth, they divorced.
Speaker 1: So was--when, when you say difficult, was it abuse in the household, or was it--was she--was there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. It was a lot of alcoholism.
Story_ID: 667133
Speaker 1: So your father. Let's talk about your father then. He was--
Speaker 2: He was a railway mail clerk. My father worked for the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service] for about forty years. And he also was a carpenter and a painter, so in order to make ends meet and to really help all of us--he wanted us in parochial school, and he did everything possible to be able to save enough money and to have enough money to send us. You know, they--at that point, you paid tuition, but you had a reduced rate if you, you know, gave money on Sunday, so we went to church every single Sunday. My father, although, we were not living with him from the time I was five years old, my father would come and pick us up, and we--my father wanted to spend more time with us, so there were times when he would literally kidnap us and take us after school without permission, and then my mother [Pearline Jackson Smith] would call the police, and he'd come and--the police would come and take us back home. Just really very, very challenging. But the bottom line was my father really wanted to have a relationship with all of us, so Sundays were spent at the Smithsonian museum [Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.], my father was really into education, because it was free, you know, the Smithsonian is free. So my father would pick us up. We'd go to church, St. Francis de Sales Church [Washington, D.C.], and then we would--St. Francis de Sales Church--and then we would go to the Smithsonian because it was free (background noise), and I've been to every single Smithsonian, and as the Smithsonian has, you know, increased with the space--science, space and science [National Air and Space Museum, Washington, D.C.], we went to all of those. His--and then once a year he would take us on a vacation by himself, little old red station wagon--it'll stop--little old red station wagon, he'd pile us all in there, and off we'd go, usually, to Niagara Falls [New York]. He had a sister, one of the first African American WACs [Women's Army Corps]--it'll stop, and she, unlike--my father never went to college, neither did his brother [Cyril Mitchell], but he had two sisters who did go to college, and they were teachers. In fact, one of my father's sisters was my mother's teacher because it was a very small community, and, and I think in some ways, the, the way in which teachers connected with students was really quite wonderful. I mean--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --'cause usually everybody in the classroom you knew. They were relatives and--or, or children of close relatives and neighbors and friends. But, anyway, my aunt was a WAC, and she had a house--she was married and lived in Buffalo [New York], so our vacations consisted of going to Niagara Falls and to Buffalo every summer--
Speaker 1: Now, now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(Simultaneous) which was great.
Speaker 1: --give me your father's name.
Speaker 2: Igna- Ignatius, Ignatius Mitchell [Ignatius Mitchell, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Ignatius Mitchell (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's--
Speaker 2: My mother--I told you, as I said, my paternal grandmother [Helen Young Mitchell] was very, very religious and was a Catholic, and followed the Catholic religion, and my father was very structured in religion as well, and, you know, he really wanted us to go to church all the time, and then parochial schools. So he was terrific in terms of making sure--so all of us, at least some of us went to Catholic schools all the way through. I did. I went all the way through Catholic schools, K through eight [kindergarten to eighth grade], and then I went to an all-girls Catholic high school, Immaculate Conception Academy [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And my father, like I said, even though my parents were divorced, my father was very, very hands on. And he was looking at my books one weekend, and I had a lot of business courses. He goes, "Why are you--well, why do they have you in all these business courses at Immaculate Conception Academy?" He says, "This--something is not right." He said, "I'm going to go down there and find out what's going on," and he put on his suit, and he went down, and he started to--he spoke to the principal, and they said, "Well, we have her in a business curriculum because I'm sure she'll become a secretary." And my father said, "My daughter is not going to become a secretary. She's going to college." He said, "Let me understand this. How many African American girls do you have? How many black girls do you have?" And they said ten. He said, "They all in business?" He said, "Yes." He said, "Get every last one of them out of the business and put them in college prep." He says, "I'm going to speak on behalf of their parents. Put them all in college prep." He did. And I called all my girlfriends. I was like, "Oh, my father is down there really raising heck. We're gonna--all gonna be in college prep." And all the parents said, "Of course. We had no idea."
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: So we went right into the college preparatory. My father was like, you are going to college.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --he was, he was very much an advocate. Now, his year of birth, I didn't get.
Speaker 2: My father was born in 1912.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Nineteen twelve [1912]. He would be 102. I guess he's--my mother is eighty-nine. She's living in assisted living in Wash- in Silver Spring, Maryland. All her mental faculties, sharp, sharp, sharp. My father died at sixty-two. I was in law school [Suffolk University Law School, Boston, Massachusetts]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at the time.
Story_ID: 667134
Speaker 1: What about your father's [Ignatius Mitchell, Jr.] background? I know about this picture that, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) the 'Dignified Woman' ['A Dignified Woman' (ph.)] that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But what was his, what was his growing up like? Did ever share that with you?
Speaker 2: Not too much. His mother [Helen Young Mitchell] was a very warm and wonderful woman. Don't know a whole lot about his dad [Ignatius Mitchell, Sr.]. His sisters were very, very nurturing--very close to his siblings, extremely close. There were five of them. One of his sisters died of a cerebral hemorrhage when she was fifty years old. That was the one that was the WAC [Women's Army Corps]. First--one of the first African Americans. Then he--my father remained very close to his two older--two sisters, and--the other two that were--that survived. And, in fact, he built a home for one of them. I told you, he was a very accomplished house painter and carpenter, and so he had a side business in addition to being a railroad mail clerk. I don't know if you know what that is, but, basically, what you do is you work the trains--he did. He worked the trains from Washington, D.C. to New York [New York]. He carried a gun because he was in charge of the certified mail, certified and registered mail, so he did, he carry a gun. And he would come to New York and then spend the night, usually at a Y [Young Men's Christian Association], and they would give him accommodations at a Y, and eat at a greasy spoon. They would give you ten dollars or maybe five dollars a day for breakfast and lunch and dinner. Then you would work the train going back down, so my father was gone every two days, and he would work a day and then be gone like two days, and then back again. I remember picking him up with my mom [Pearline Jackson Smith] years ago. We'd have or pajamas on, and she'd go down to Union Station in D.C. and pick him up at midnight, so with that erratic schedule, he really wasn't home a lot. But anyway, very close to his two sisters, built them a home. They lived next door to each other for fifty years. They traveled together. They were very well educated. My father had a brother [Cyril Mitchell], and neither he nor his brother went to college, but his brother worked in the government. I think he was like a GS-7 [General Schedule] or something, so fairly good job, and then he had siblings. But I don't remember a whole lot about my father's actual upbringing because, don't forget, I mean, we talked a lot, but I didn't live with my father after I was--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --five years old until I was in high school [Immaculate Conception Academy, Washington, D.C.]. I did live with him for my last two years of high school, and he wanted to sort of see what was going on, and my younger sister [Vicki Mitchell Pendleton] and I went to live with him at some point.
Speaker 1: So Nina [HistoryMaker Nina M. Wells], at this point--so are your parents from Maryland?
Speaker 2: Maryland.
Speaker 1: So the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --so the--
Speaker 2: They're both from Maryland.
Speaker 1: --so the--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --relation- the, the--their background is really Maryland history--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --background.
Speaker 2: And the families knew each other, and then my family, you know, was surprised when my mother decided to marry my father because he was so much older than her, and she decided to drop out of Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]. She had gotten a scholarship to go to Howard, being valedictorian. She dropped out and then she got pregnant, and then my father went off to war [World War II, WWII].
Speaker 1: So they were disappointed.
Speaker 2: Oh, they were.
Speaker 1: They were (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They were disappointed, yes.
Speaker 1: Even though they knew each other, they were--
Speaker 2: They did. They did.
Speaker 1: --disappointed.
Speaker 2: And the families weren't necessarily friendly.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: They knew each other in that community. And they just didn't expect my mother to marry my father.
Speaker 1: Now, is that area that we're talking about, is that what is considered Prince George's--
Speaker 2: It is Prince George's County [Maryland] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) County now? County--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: 'Cause Mitchell- okay.
Speaker 2: Mitchellville [Maryland]--
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay.
Speaker 2: --is Prince George's County, yeah, it is.
Speaker 1: So--
Story_ID: 667135
Speaker 1: Let me ask you what your earliest memory is of growing up.
Speaker 2: Somewhat challenging because I remember leaving Maryland and going to D.C., and my mother [Pearline Jackson Smith] was trying to find different places for us to live in D.C., so it was a, it was a challenging period, a lot of upheaval just trying to figure out where we were going to live and the schools we were going to go to, and she finally found a house in Northeast, Washington, so actually, we did go to--I didn't go to kindergarten. I left D.C. right as the Brown decision [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] was being decided. My sister Diane [Diane Mitchell Hill] went to a segregated (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You left Maryland you mean.
Speaker 2: We left Maryland. We left Maryland when my parents decided to divorce, but one of my sisters went to a segregated school in Surrattsville, Maryland [Clinton, Maryland]. We were right near Surrattsville, and I didn't go to kindergarten. They didn't have mandatory kindergarten back then, and then I got to D.C., and we did go to a public school, Bunker Hill school [Bunker Hill Elementary School, Washington, D.C.], for one year, and then that was a transition year in which my father [Ignatius Mitchell, Jr.] decided we had--he wanted us to go to a Catholic school, so starting in second grade we did go. So my earliest memories are leaving Washington D- I mean, leaving Maryland and coming to Washington, D.C. and just a lot of transition in our lives.
Speaker 1: So it's--was uncertain.
Speaker 2: It was (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 'Cause you're--
Speaker 2: It was.
Speaker 1: So what does that mean? Are you going from apartment to apartment, are you--
Speaker 2: Apartment initially, apartment initially, and then my mother found a home, a house for us, and then once we moved into the house, and she got a whole series of like, you know, different jobs, and she was working day and night, so my sisters really took over, and then my mother also had some relatives that would come and live with us, and I don't really remember all of the different people that assisted with childcare.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't remember. It was pretty disjointed, and--but my dad was a real constant, though--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in our lives (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So he would still come and--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah. Oh, definitely 'cause he worked, you know, that crazy schedule, but when he was around, especially weekends, so I had that stability, and--
Speaker 1: So how--why, why did they break up? You think it was age difference?
Speaker 2: I do think a lot of it was the age difference. I do. And then my father came back from the war [World War II, WWII], I think, a different person.
Speaker 1: He changed.
Speaker 2: He changed.
Speaker 1: Well, that happened--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --to people.
Speaker 2: Yeah. He, he was a--he was more rigid, I think, than he had been before. He was a master sergeant and had been away, and I think the rigidity set in, so he wasn't the same person. She, at that point, probably wasn't the same person either.
Story_ID: 667136
Speaker 1: So tell me about your early years of growing up. You know, I mean, so you're schooling, so, you know, I do have to ask you before I, you know, sort of move on. Your gray eyes. How many people in your family have the gray eyes?
Speaker 2: Well, actually--
Speaker 1: Would you call it gray or hazel?
Speaker 2: More, more hazel. I would say more, but we, we look like every, you know, shade, every--I have a cousin with blue eyes and red hair. My nephew has red hair. My children [Phillip Wells and Teresa Wells] have my eyes, so throughout the family, and it's a really big family. You'll, you'll see a little bit of everything, every, you know, color to--you know, shade, every color eyes, every color hair, the whole nine yards. But growing up, the, the most interesting memory I have is, I didn't get involved in a lot of activities. My parents [Pearline Jackson Smith and Ignatius Mitchell, Jr.], obviously, couldn't afford to put us in dance lessons, piano, nothing. Except, I had the Girl Scouts [Girl Scouts of the United States of America], and I had the Girl Scouts at my, St. Francis de Sales [St. Francis de Sales Church, Washington, D.C.] had a wonderful woman, Mrs. Van Lewen [ph.] who had like seven or eight kids, and regardless of that, she was the best den mother, and so my sister Vicki [Vicki Mitchell Pendleton] and I, that was sort of our escape was the Girl Scouts. It was, it was a wonderful experience, yeah.
Speaker 1: And you, you talked about going to Girl Scout camp, right?
Speaker 2: I did go to Girl Scout camp. I don't know when I spoke about that.
Speaker 1: No, I mean, I read about that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You did?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I did go.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It was the only time I went. I--actually, I went to two camps. I was a safety patrol. We used to have these safety patrol units at your school. We could volunteer, and then you were in charge of the--a particular school crossing, and you wore a little uniform (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: And they had a camp. They had a day camp. We went to that day camp 'cause they paid for it. And then I went to Girl Scout camp, and that was like the greatest experience of my life to go to Girl Scout camp.
Speaker 1: Now, what, what age were you then, do you think? And--
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: 'Cause Girl Scouts start--you know, 'cause there's the cub- is it the--
Speaker 2: I was a Bluebird, too. I forgot.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: I was a Bluebird for a minute if I--for a few years I was a Bluebird, and then I became a Girl Scout, and I was a Girl Scout up until the time I went to high school [Immaculate Conception Academy, Washington, D.C.]. Mrs. Van Lewen, I think I probably became a Girl Scout maybe fourth grade, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth grade. I had lots of--big sash, lots of badges.
Story_ID: 667137
Speaker 1: And I also, in high school--I went to--yeah, I told you about my high school, all-girls Catholic high school [Immaculate Conception Academy, Washington, D.C.], and I was roller--a roller skater. That we'd have a--this great big place in D.C. [National Arena Roller Rink, Washington, D.C.] on Kalorama Road, and you got the big white boots. I, I would work. We got a--in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], fifteen years old, you went downtown, you stood in line, you got a work permit, and you worked every summer. Back then, unlike now, any young person that wanted a job, got a job, any young person, fifteen years old. To the federal government--health, education and welfare [U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services] was my first job. I had a mentor, Conway Wilson [ph.]. They just adopted me. I was in--well, fifteen years old, I was probably about tenth grade. They gave me a wonderful job, a great assignment. It was so empowering. I, I think they spoiled me. After that, there was no job that was good enough for me. I just felt like everybody should always treat me the way they treated me. They just decided I was just, you know, really great young intern. I remember it, health, education and welfare, that every summer we had, you know, a different assignment, department of corrections [D.C. Department of Corrections]. I remember that assignment because I would visit all of the local corrections facilities including Lorton [Lorton Reformatory, Lorton, Virginia]. And at that time, I knew my husband Ted [HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.], and we had high school friends, and I remember seeing a couple of his high school friends serving time in Lorton, and I was like, what the heck did they do? Some minor crimes. But I did do the department, the [U.S.] Department of Agriculture. And then Ted worked for the department of interior [U.S. Department of the Interior], and we were--gosh--we were juniors in high school, and he worked for the department of interior, and we gotta--I would work my job all day. I then would go to his job in the evening, and our job was to assign bands all over the city for all these wonderful programs, so we got a lot of overtime, and we saved that money and bought a car, so when we got married later on, there we were. We had our money all saved up.
Story_ID: 667138
Speaker 1: But, anyway, I, I loved the fact that everybody that wanted to work could work. I mean, it changed the dynamics of what life was like in Washington, D.C., and one summer, the Garfinckel's [Washington, D.C.]. I don't know if you've heard the story of Garfinckel's, it was one of the best specialty stores. They decided to have a teen fashion board, and I was a junior in high school [Immaculate Conception Academy, Washington, D.C.] and I applied. I used to sew, my mother [Pearline Jackson Smith] sewed. My mother was a seamstress and made prom gowns. She had a neighbor that would assist her in really, you know, learning how to really do this, so my mother would make anything for a--for the prom. You couldn't afford to buy it, so she would get a couple of things of fabric. Well, I watched her, and I said, I want to sew, but she was afraid to let me use her machine. She said, "It's a Singer. If you use it, you might break it." And she says, "You can watch, but you don't use my machine." So I told my father [Ignatius Mitchell, Jr.], and I said, "You know, I would love to have a machine," so he bought me a Kenmore machine at Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.]. He was a big Sears person. He bought me a Kenmore machine, and I lived on that sewing machine. I made everything I wore, and I remember making a dress for this teen fashion board interview. I got the interview, and they said wear your best outfit, and I made this dress, and my mother saw the dress. Well, that summer, I'd started out working at Dart drugstore [Dart Drug, Washington, D.C.].
Story_ID: 667139
Speaker 1: So you were good at, at sewing then, but--
Speaker 2: (Gasps).
Speaker 1: Go on.
Speaker 2: Really good. Well, I don't know how--about how good.
Speaker 1: 'Cause people--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --have talent, so you could--you were good with the patterns. Which, which patterns did you use?
Speaker 2: I didn't do Vogue. I did Butterick, okay. I didn't do the easiest. I--you know, they'd show you whether it was easy, medium or whatever, but, basically, I would pick up--in the morning, I would go and get like a couple yards of fabric. By that evening, I'd have something to wear, but half the time, it wasn't as if you were putting in really intricate, you know, zippers and all kinds of things. It was seams, seams, seams, but the whole idea was, you could have different, wonderful clothes for nothing, for really nothing. And then I started making everybody's gifts, dash- I made dashikis for the guys for Christmas, but anyway, it was wonderful. But I made this dress for this fashion show. My mother [Pearline Jackson Smith] saw it, and she was like, "That is really--you're not going to win with that." She goes, "That's really horrible looking." And it was a little cheap looking, little dress, but I just had a little pair of pumps, and I figured, I'm--I'll, I'll do it. Well, my mother went shopping, and one of my cousins worked in the building where I was at, the Dart drugstore [Dart Drug, Washington, D.C.]. I would get there at five o'clock in the morning. That was my shift, work the shift. And I said, god, if I get this job, if I get this modeling job, I'm outta here, right? But it was a good experience for me 'cause many of the women, I was saving my tips for college. I was saving my tips to--I paid for all of my SATs, tests, all of my college admissions. I paid for everything. And the women were saying to me that was their milk money. I said, "What do you mean milk money?" They said, "That's my--to buy my kids milk," so early on, I realized, oh, my gosh. I know I'm going to college. I don't want this life for myself, so my mother had my cousin deliver to me--right before the interview, before I got dressed to leave the Dart drugstore and go for the interview down at Garfinckel's [Washington, D.C.], my mother sent a dress, shoes, and a hat, and I wore all of that. And it was a orange dress, and a blue and white polka dot scarf, a pair of beige shoes just like these that I have on, sling backs, and a big blue hat. Well, I walked in, and the people said to me, "Where did you get your flair for fashion?" Of course, I had never had this outfit. I never looked like this in my life. Although, my mother was very into us having beautiful clothes for Easter. Easter Sunday, we always had beautiful, beautiful outfits on, and then--you know, 'cause you wore that, you know, the whole year. And then they said, where--I said, "My flair for fashion comes from my mother." Oh, I--how could I take credit for this, right. I didn't wear my little cheap dress I made. And I did win, and they selected twelve girls, two African Americans; myself and another young girl. And we basically did fashion shows for Garfinckel's at the Washington hotel [Hotel Washington, Washington, D.C.], and we also worked in Garfinckel's. And it was so funny, Julieanna [Julieanna Richardson], they gave us a 33 percent discount. Well, there wasn't a thing in the store I could buy. I mean, even with 33 percent off (laughter). We went looking through the (unclear) and say, nope, not gonna happen, right? It was like crazy. But I had a friend, and she lived in Chevy Chase [Maryland], and her parents had an account. The first time I ever saw people have like a restaurant account at the--well, I'll tell you the restaurant, right there across from the, the bureau of engraving [U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing], Ebbitt's grill [Old Ebbitt Grill, Washington, D.C.]. And she says, "Do you want to have lunch?" She goes, "I'll sign for it." What is that, right? And we'd go to Ebbitt's. It's still there. Ebbitt's grill is still there. And we'd have the fanciest lunch, and she'd sign. And I was like, oh, my, god. This is like--I'm--I've now entered another world, right? And when I modeled, I would model bikinis in the tea room. You know, they had a tea room where all the little old ladies would have their tea, and, and I remember them saying to me, "Where did you get that tan?" I said, "It's natural" (laughter). They, they didn't know what I was. It was so funny. But it was an exposure to a whole different world, right.
Speaker 1: So was she, was she fair skinned like you or not?
Speaker 2: My mother?
Speaker 1: No, no, no, your, the other, the other girl that--did she model, too?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we, we both did, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was she, was she brown skinned?
Speaker 2: Yeah, more brown--
Speaker 1: More brown?
Speaker 2: --right. I don't know if she did the tea--I don't know if she did the bikinis in the tea room.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because they split us all up, and we all did different things. We did different fashion shows, but we all worked on the floor--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --of Garfinckel's--
Speaker 1: Now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) part time.
Speaker 1: --what year was this?
Speaker 2: This would have been 1966, 1966.
Speaker 1: Okay. So you were sixteen then (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was sixteen, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 667140
Speaker 1: Let's go back a little bit. Just a few things that we typically like to ask. So--and I'm getting a sense of the chronology, but I want to, you know, review the schools, too, and everything. So was your mother [Pearline Jackson Smith] sewing all the time, was--you know, from the beginning? Do you remember that?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, no. That came later (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) When, when did things settle down? So this is--you said--
Speaker 2: That's a good point. That's a very good point. When did things settle down?
Speaker 1: Because where you lived, and you lived--
Speaker 2: My mother remarried. Okay. My mother remarried.
Speaker 1: When did she remarry?
Speaker 2: She remarried when I was--let's see. She remarried when I was in the ninth grade.
Speaker 1: Both--
Speaker 2: Ninth grade.
Speaker 1: So from--
Speaker 2: So, so--
Speaker 1: --you were five to--
Speaker 2: --so fifteen, so 19--like 1964--
Speaker 1: Okay. So up until (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) I go in--yeah, that's around the time.
Speaker 1: So up until that point, Nina [HistoryMaker Nina M. Wells], where are you? Are you living in different--where are you living? That's what I'm wondering.
Speaker 2: Up until that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What's the--
Speaker 2: --time, we lived on--this--at the same place, Bunker Hill Road. We lived there from the time I was six until I went to high school [Immaculate Conception Academy, Washington, D.C.], ninth grade, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And can you--
Speaker 2: And you're right. Things did settle down. It's so funny that you thought of that.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: 'Cause, wait a minute, why is, is she sewing there? How did she start sewing in this--she remarried.
Speaker 1: Okay. So what's--when we--in Bunker--I'm on Bunker Hill Road. What sights, smells, and sounds remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: We spent a lot of time--D.C. [Washington, D.C.] has these great alleys behind your house, and you spent your life out there in the alley with all the neighborhood kids, and you did have a bicycle. I don't know whether we shared a bicycle, but you take the bikes and go all over the neighborhood, and you had a lot of fruit trees, and I remember we'd get a bag, and the neighbors would scream, but you'd get a couple of apples and stop. And then we had a drugstore, and we, we'd go down to the drugstore and buy penny candy. We ruined our teeth. Our teeth were a disaster. I remember going to a dentist one day. My mother struggled to make sure everybody had dental care. And the dentist came out one day, and he goes, "Your mother hasn't paid the bill. You all have to go home." So we had the worst teeth. It was a African American dentist, and he just said, "I, I can't do this anymore. There's so many of you, and you all have bad teeth." We ate so much candy. Our diet was bizarre during that period before my mother remarried.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: I mean, you're right. It was really bizarre (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, was, was--
Speaker 2: My sister [Diane Mitchell Hill] cooked for us, and she cooked really--
Speaker 1: Now, now was--
Speaker 2: --strange stuff.
Speaker 1: --was this 1419 52nd Avenue, or is this different?
Speaker 2: No. That's, that's when I lived with my father [Ignatius Mitchell, Jr.].
Speaker 1: That's--
Speaker 2: How did you get that address?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Isn't that interesting?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, you all did some research.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's when I lived with my dad.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Like off of Benning Road [sic.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a kind rough neighborhood (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay. When you--
Speaker 2: When I was in high school.
Speaker 1: That was in high school. Okay.
Speaker 2: That was in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 667141
Speaker 1: What sounds and what smells remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: In D.C. [Washington, D.C.], back in--okay. So in, in the earlier years, you're saying--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --Bunker Hill Road.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: What, what would I really say went on at Bunker Hill Road? Sights and smells?
Speaker 1: Smells and sounds.
Speaker 2: Probably, probably my sister, she'd let us sleep out in the backyard. We had a tent, and she'd make the most bizarre food you can ever imagine. She ended up being a gourmet chef, having her own restaurant. But she'd make like weird--like oatmeal, and she'd put blue food coloring in it, and we were like, this is really gross. She was always experimenting 'cause she was like, kind of like the primary caregiver in terms of--we had other relatives, but my sister would say, "They don't know anything. Don't talk to them. Don't let them talk to you. I'm in charge." And she was wonderful, my sister. The other sight was--I don't know if this qualifies, but if you had a science project, you'd tell her the night before, and you'd say, "Oh, my god. I forgot. I had a really important science project. I'm going to fail." And she'd say, "Oh, tell me about the project." And you'd tell her. "Okay. What's it on? What's it supposed to be?" And she'd say, "Go to bed." You'd wake up, and there was this amazing poster board with everything you could imagine. You know, this is my sister that just passed away. I spoke about it, to tell her children at the funeral, and they didn't--they said, we didn't even know she did that. I'm like, she was an artist, super creative, brilliant, the most well read of all of us. There was no time when she wasn't reading three or four books at the same time, extremely well read.
Speaker 1: And her name again?
Speaker 2: Diane [Diane Mitchell Hill].
Speaker 1: Diane, okay.
Speaker 2: Diane, Diane was just so smart. She knew something about everything, and she didn't--she'd research it. We had the old fashioned encyclopedias--oops, encyclopedias. She would--c'mon, right. But she would do that for you. It just--'cause she knew we were all, you know, having a difficult time, and she always wanted to protect you from everything, and she didn't want you to get in trouble, right. She never told our mother [Pearline Jackson Smith] anything we ever did. She kept everything close to the vest. She prote- and she just protected you. We used say, our brother, brother used to beat us up. The minute you would say anything about him, she'd say, "Don't you touch them," and she'd beat him up for you. Just, so I had real--and then I had a--my other sister, Kathy [Kathy Mitchell Weaver], she was the one that would help you with, you know, social challenges, you know, "Got something at school. I have nothing to wear." She'd go in her closet, take--, "Wear this," you know, so I was really lucky to have the two of them, you know, and my dad [Ignatius Mitchell, Jr.]. My dad was great.
Story_ID: 667142
Speaker 1: Your mother's [Pearline Jackson Smith] just struggling to make ends meet.
Speaker 2: Definitely.
Speaker 1: And so then--but where does the--is church playing a role in everything, or, or do you go--you know, are you regular churchgoers, or do you--are--
Speaker 2: With my father [Ignatius Mitchell, Jr.] we are.
Speaker 1: Your--
Speaker 2: My mother never went to church.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what other things are influencing you as, as young people? Are holidays a big thing? Is it--
Speaker 2: Not really.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I wouldn't say holidays. I, I told you the summers. We, we were very close to our cousins.
Speaker 1: So--but you were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Very, very close. My mother had--my maternal cousins on my maternal side, not the paternal side. Really were not close with those cousins. My mother had two siblings, a brother [Walter Jackson] and a sister [Dolores Jackson], very close to their children, very clo- and then we were close in age. So the summers, as I said, would influence us was being at my grandmother's [Pearl Jackson] house with the siblings. I had one sibling [sic.] who was very, very good in, in science, and the National Heart Association [sic. American Heart Association] had a big, big symposium, and you could attend, and then they had a component of it where they had essay contests, and my--I remember my cousin and I participated, but he was a brilliant science student, and I remember him getting--mak- getting all of the awards that year, and he went on to Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California], an undergraduate, and then Johns Hopkins medical school [Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland], went to Hopkins. And it's so ironic that his son, who went to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] and Georgetown Law School [Georgetown University Law School; Georgetown University Law Center, Washington, D.C.], had a terrible problem with his throat, and he said, "You know what, let's go up to Hopkins." My, my cousin took his son up there, and they diagnosed the most rarest form of cancer that you can have. It's a cancer that you get in the embryonic stage, and it doesn't manifest itself until many years later. And at thirty years old, it manifested itself, and just tumors all over. It was so interesting. No one could diagnose it, and, finally, he went back up to Hopkins where he had done his training. But, anyway, so what influenced us was really, we had, you know, the cousins and what they were doing in their lives, and, yes, religion. My father was, you know, very, very into that. And then I played basketball in high school [Immaculate Conception Academy, Washington, D.C.], so I had sports, as well as, so I had the Girl Scouts [Girl Scouts of the United States of America], and then once I went to high school, I started playing basketball. And played varsity basketball for four years, so being an athlete was, was really good.
Story_ID: 667143
Speaker 1: In my junior year of high school [Immaculate Conception Academy, Washington, D.C.], the summer before, my younger sister [Vicki Mitchell Pendleton] and I moved in with my dad [Ignatius Mitchell, Jr.], and that's the address you have, 52nd Avenue. My father had a one bedroom apartment, and we slept on the couch, but we needed to--we, we just--my mom [Pearline Jackson Smith] had remarried, and everything--now everything had started to go a little crazy there.
Speaker 2: So the--you didn't get along with her husband.
Speaker 1: I did. We did. He was wonderful. He was a lovely, lovely man, lovely, lovely man. But my mother and my sister just didn't get along that well. They were--we were teenagers. It was the typical teenagers, and how are you going to manage, and how are you going to handle it? And it just kind was not good.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah. But my stepfather was a lovely, lovely man.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Who, actually, really helped me in, in many, many ways. He was a very smart man, and he was a very, very good influence.
Speaker 2: You know what's interesting when you're telling a story, because so many kids' lives go out of control, you know, when they don't have structure, but it's interesting that there was structure. You know, look at how your all your--you know, your family has done, so--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you could have gone off in a different direction.
Speaker 1: Everybody helped everybody else. I remember filling out financial aid forms for all of my siblings. There were four of us in college at one time. My brother, Eric [Eric Mitchell], who's the orthopedic surgeon went off to college [St. Joseph's University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] on a basketball scholarship. At one point, there were four of us in college at the same time, and I did all the financial aid forms for everybody 'cause everybody had to go on financial aid. You know, it was work study. It was a loan. Maybe you got a little bit of a grant, and then my father tried to help as much as he could. I remember my father gave me a check for nine hundred dollars. He goes, "This is all I can do for four years of college. I hope it--." I said, "It's wonderful. Are you kidding? It's great," you know--
Speaker 2: But this--so what created that sense of everybody working together?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, and--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and finding the place? What created that, do you--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --think?
Speaker 1: And then Ted [Wells' husband, HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.] was part of that, too, because Ted was applying to colleges.
Speaker 2: What--well, I know, but let's--
Speaker 1: Yeah, at the--
Speaker 2: I'm talking about even--
Speaker 1: --same time.
Speaker 2: --before that.
Speaker 1: But even at that time--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --he was part of that whole piece of we all wanna go to college, and how do we really get there? But how did my--all right. What really happened was, my two older sisters [Diane Mitchell Hill and Kathy Mitchell Weaver] went to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], but they worked as telephone operators during the day, and they went part time. They went at night. They bought themselves a car, and they got apartments, so we watched them really, really hustle. I mean, the idea that they would work all day long as, you know, phone company, C and P phone company [Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company; Verizon Washington, D.C. Inc., Washington, D.C.] operators. Then their night schedule was really rough. They had these apartments. They had to pay their rent. They had cars. They struggled. And when we saw that, we all said, you know what, the rest of us need to get away. So when my brother got a--he went to DeMatha high school [DeMatha Catholic High School, Hyattsville, Maryland], a very famous high school in Washington, D.C. [sic.], and he got a scholarship to college. We all said, we--this--that's the route we ought to take. We got to get out of here. We got to go to college. And that really motivated us very much. That's why we played ball, and we thought, play a sport, study, and work really hard. Save your money in the summer. We all had our summer jobs. But I think we got it from my two older sisters, who, from the very beginning, they were very nurturing, and they knew that there was--there were things missing in our lives, and they wanted to help us compensate, so because of their generous spirit, I think we all decided that we all had to help each other, and if we didn't, we saw what the consequences of that really were, so I don't know what it was, but we were all extremely, extremely close.
Story_ID: 667144
Speaker 1: And I have one, one other question about this period, and that is, what were you like as a young person? I mean, what are--what is--are you quiet? Are you, you know, outgoing? Are you, you know--
Speaker 2: Well, everybody says that what happened to me was that I kind of fell through the cracks. I wasn't one of the older ones. I wasn't the one getting a lot of attention, one of the younger ones, but what really helped me was my dad [Ignatius Mitchell, Jr.], and he really made me feel special, you know.
Speaker 1: Because you were in the middle.
Speaker 2: I was right in the middle. But when I went to live with him, he and I bonded like never before. My, my brother [Eric Mitchell] kind of overshadowed me. My brother was a big basketball star, and, actually, socially, things were very, very good because he had a lot of really nice friends, basketball friends, yeah. And then my younger sister [Vicki Mitchell Pendleton] and I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, now, what school is he going to?
Speaker 2: He went to DeMatha high school [DeMatha Catholic High School, Hyattsville, Maryland], which was a--
Speaker 1: He--and you're going to what high--
Speaker 2: Immaculate Conception Academy [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: So, so are they close, those schools?
Speaker 2: No. Schools weren't close 'cause he was a little bit further out, and I had a brother school, and it was John Carroll [Archbishop Carroll High School, Washington, D.C.], and then my sister went to St. Cecelia's [St. Cecilia's Academy, Washington, D.C.], and Saint Cecelia's--so we were all like in the same kind of Catholic high school, you know, sort of grouping, and--but my brother had a lot of really great friends, and he's only two years older than me, so that was really nice socially. But my cousin went to Calvin Coolidge High School [Calvin Coolidge Senior High School, Washington, D.C.] where Ted [Wells' husband, HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.] went, and she was in a sorority, so I joined the sorority that she was in, the Ingenues [ph.], so I joined the Ingenues. So I got to be one of the cool girls who was associated with the public school girls, even though I was a Catholic school girl, and Catholic--my, my school was very, you know, kind of rigid, and we really didn't have any real social life, so I was really lucky because I had the cool cl- I made my clothes. I went to the parties, and I was a jock, so that was kind of like cool, too, so socially, I was very sophisticated socially.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I would say. And I had it--my father would let us--he had a little Volkswagen. He would let us drive the car around, so we went to all the parties, but back then, D.C. [Washington, D.C.] was safe. That's how I met Ted, going to all the parties and everything. I was a, I was a good student. I wasn't a great student. I was, I was a good student. But I had very little guidance in terms of college choices. That piece at my school was very lacking. Don't forget. They started out--I was supposed to go to business school. And they--at one point, the nun said to me, "I don't know why you're wasting your time going to college." They said, "You'd make a great secretary." So the whole college piece for me was challenging. I didn't--knew I didn't want to go to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] 'cause I didn't want to stay home. Even though Howard was a good school, I knew I needed to--I, I wanted to go away desperately. I said, I got to get out of town, you know, and go 'cause I didn't--what was I going to do staying in D.C., getting an apartment, getting a job? And so the college piece, in terms of college admissions never was very, very good for me. I just wasn't exposed enough to the really good schools. I never--I didn't know about Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia]. I didn't know about Wellesley [Wellesley College, Wellesley, Massachusetts]. I didn't know about those schools.
Story_ID: 667145
Speaker 1: So Nina [HistoryMaker Nina M. Wells], are you--so you said, I was--I think you said we were social--I haven't heard that term. That was a cute way of saying it. We were socially advanced, did you--
Speaker 2: Sophisticated, we were (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sophisticated.
Speaker 2: We were.
Speaker 1: So tell me--
Speaker 2: We were. Yeah.
Speaker 1: So what it's like--how many parties or what, what are groups? What kind of music are people listening to? What--you know, what's--
Speaker 2: This is back in--so really, you know, serious R and B, you know, Temptations [The Temptations], Miracles [The Miracles], lot of [HistoryMaker] Smokey Robinson, James Brown, James Brown, and so it's--okay. So during the day, my mother [Pearline Jackson Smith] was pretty rigid about cleaning the house and housework was like a big deal. She had all these kids. She wanted the house really nice. So we spent a lot of our time doing housework. Even if you had homework, she was like, "You'll get your homework done. Clean the house first," which was a big deal. So Saturdays, we'd get up like early in the morning, and we--this was when--after my mother remarried. We'd clean all day long. She was now around more. Before she wasn't around. She was working all those jobs, so my sisters [Diane Mitchell Hill and Kathy Mitchell Weaver] kind of ran the house. Now my sisters are gone. They're in college [at Howard University, Washington, D.C.]. They're--they have their own apartments. They're gone. Now my mother is kind of, you know, ruling things, and she's very rigid. We're cleaning all day, but, finally, at like seven or, six or seven o'clock, we'd say, "Can we please go out now?" And that was your refuge. You would get on your outfit and hit the parties, and you were allowed to do that, so you had a nice little social network of friends, and that was a great escape. It was wonderful just to see your friends and go out. There was no alcohol. There were no drugs back then. There were no guns. You had a couple of gangs in certain areas of the city, and you knew where to go or not to go. Yeah.
Speaker 1: So what about the schools, though, were you associating with a lot of the kids from the public schools (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Coolidge, Calvin Coolidge [Calvin Coolidge High School; Calvin Coolidge Senior High School, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Calvin Coolidge.
Speaker 2: Coolidge.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's where my cousin went. That's--I was in that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And that's where Ted [Wells' husband, HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.] went.
Speaker 2: That's where Ted was.
Story_ID: 667146
Speaker 1: So tell, talk about meeting Ted [Wells' husband, HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.].
Speaker 2: Yeah. Well, I, like I said, I knew a lot of the kids from Coolidge [Calvin Coolidge High School; Calvin Coolidge Senior High School, Washington, D.C.], and a young man had asked me to go on a bus trip, and the bus trip was sponsored by the coach of Calvin Coolidge, the football coach. So if the team did well every year, he would take them on a bus ride to--we were going to see the Baltimore Bullets [Washington Wizards] play in Baltimore [Maryland], basketball game. So it was like a big deal. So this young man asked me to go, and I said, sure. So I'm on the bus, and sitting in front of me was Ted--excuse me, and his girlfriend. Then afterwards, he--Ted turned around and saw me, and then he said to my date, "Let's trade numbers, phone numbers," so they traded phone numbers, so Ted called me. But at the time, he was known as Tokey. He was a jock. And I kind of knew about him, and he was like in a nice crowd, but not exactly my crowd. Like if he'd come to the parties, he wouldn't get in the front door. They would end up coming in later when somebody would open the door for them.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: So I was like, I know this guy. I seen him come in the back door. I'm like, he's not one of the invitees, invited guests, so I told him I didn't--wasn't interested. I said, "No, I know you, and I know your friends, and that's--no, no thank you." So he kept calling me, and then he had a friend call and say, "Oh, I can, I can tell you, he's really a good guy. He's really smart. He does well in school. He's really nice." I was like, "No, I don't--I'm not interested." So he kept on, kept on, kept on calling. He goes, "Why don't you even give me a chance? Like one date." I was like, I don't know. So I said, okay. So I went out on one date with him, and I was like totally impressed 'cause I thought he was more of a--I used to say, "You're, you're just a hoodlum, and your friends are hoodlums." But I just meant that they were like, you know, kind of really out there, but he was so nice, and he was so well dressed, and I thought he was going come with some hip hop clothes on, and he had on Bass weejuns [G.H. Bass and Company], and I was like, oh, my god. You look nice. So from that point on, I thought maybe he was worthy of my attention, so--and then I found out that he was really like--really interested in going to college, too, which was really important 'cause at first my father [Ignatius Mitchell, Jr.] did not like him.
Speaker 1: Oh, he didn't.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: What did he say?
Speaker 2: No. He was I don't really--I don't know. He's--Ted was pretty much raised by his mom [Phyllis Wells]. He goes, "Oh, a single parent." I'm like, "I'm [sic.] a single parent." And my father said, "No, I don't think I really like him. I don't think he's a good date." And I said, "Well, you don't know him. You have to get to meet him, meet his family and everything." So once Ted--once my father met Ted's mother, he said, "Oh, she's really lovely." And then, believe it or not, Ted's family, once we started dating, his family, his mother and sister [Toni Wells] would join us for Christmas dinner for like years, and then when we decided to get married, we just got married at, at a Christmas dinner informally, so it was so interesting how the mothers really became friends.
Speaker 1: Oh, the two mothers became friends (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. Not the fath--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The two mothers.
Speaker 2: The mothers 'cause Ted's father [Theodore V. Wells, Sr.] wasn't in the picture.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And then--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --my father thought Ted's mother was quite lovely, too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But my father didn't join us for dinner. My mother [Pearline Jackson Smith], remember, was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I see.
Speaker 2: --remarried, yeah.
Speaker 1: So you know--
Speaker 2: So it was interesting how we kind of merged the two families, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because I read that you went to see movies your first date, 'Fahrenheit'--maybe 45- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) '451.' That was--well, that was the first date, but don't forget, when I met Ted, that wasn't a date.
Speaker 1: Right. That--
Speaker 2: They switched (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) that was on the bus.
Speaker 2: Yes. How did you read that?
Speaker 1: Go on, all right.
Speaker 2: Where did that come from? That's true, 'Fahrenheit 451,' yeah, absolutely. Thank you for refreshing my recollection, yeah. I--we used to--I used to keep track. I'd write down every date and give it a grade (laughter). For years and years I had a record of every place we went, and then I would evaluate it. I mean, how was it? And what was he like? (Unclear), right?
Story_ID: 667147
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) At what point are you getting serious with him?
Speaker 2: Well, you know what, we had a little breakup before our high school proms, so we were getting serious. We met at fifteen, we're sophomores. Then junior year we're dating. Senior year we're dating. And then we break up right before the prom. So he goes to the prom with someone else, and I go to the prom with someone else, so we don't date that whole summer before college. And then my freshman year, Ted [HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.]--you know, we were big letter writers, letter writers, so we would write--he started writing me letters at college, and he said, "Can I please see you at Thanksgiving?" And I said, "Well, okay." So when I saw him at Thanksgiving, we decided right away we had to get back together again, so there go the letters. In fact, I wish I could find them 'cause they're somewhere in my house, but I moved--I've moved so many times, three times. I had big bags of every letter Ted had ever written, and every--really, every day, we wrote every day, every day 'cause, you know, you didn't get a lot mail in college, but you'd go to that mailbox, the old fashion way, not email. We didn't have email. And there was always a letter, and I'd always have a letter for him. Isn't that something? Yeah. But we had big bags of them. I can't remember where they are now. But anyway, and then you probably know the story about how in my sophomore year--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --Ted said, you know, first of all, the phone bills were really--I didn't say we didn't talk on the phone. We did talk on the phone.
Speaker 1: Now, he's at--let's talk about this.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He's at Holy Cross [College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Holy Cross.
Speaker 1: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: And he gets a scholarship--
Speaker 2: He does.
Speaker 1: --there.
Speaker 2: A football scholarship.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And he plays football for one year, and then he converts it to an academic scholarship, so he stops playing. I'm at College of Mount St. Joseph [Mount St. Joseph University] in Cincinnati, Ohio, and we meet--try to meet in between, and so we're--we, you know, trying to fly here, fly there. It gets so expensive with the flying, the, the phone bills, and he says to me, "You know, it would be really great if you came to school in Massachusetts." So he goes to a party at Wellesley College [Wellesley, Massachusetts] one night, and he meets a woman at Newton College [Newton College of the Sacred Heart], which is in Newton, Mass [Newton Centre, Massachusetts], right down the road from Wellesley. And he goes, you know, "I have a girlfriend, and she went to a Catholic school [Immaculate Conception Academy, Washington, D.C.], and Newton College--." This is Sacred Heart. He goes, "Wouldn't it be great," he says, "it would be great if I could get her an interview and she could transfer." So my friend then goes to the dean of admissions and says, "Could you give an interview to this young woman who's at this other college?" And she says yes. So Ted arranges for the interview. He arranges for one of his friends to pick me up from the airport in Boston [Massachusetts] to drive me to Worcester [Massachusetts], which is about an hour away, so I fly down. I go out, have an interview, and they say you're accepted. So then I pack up, but by then, I'm a--I had just finished my first semester of junior year, and they said, "You have to do eight semesters. You cannot--you know, eight semesters, you have to do--," I'm sorry, four semesters. "You have to do two full years in order to get your degree here." I'm like, "Fine, I'll just do an extra semester."
Story_ID: 667148
Speaker 1: So I then transferred December of 1972.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Is that right, nineteen seventy--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, no, no (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's not--
Speaker 1: Seventy [1970], '70 [1970], '70 [1970], '70 [1970], '70 [1970].
Speaker 2: It's '70 [1970].
Speaker 1: You're good, 1970, I then transfer to Newton College Sacred Heart [Newton College of the Sacred Heart, Newton Centre, Massachusetts], which I loved. And the--there was a--at that point, 'cause, of course, Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed in '68 [1968]. There was a, as you know, a large class of African American students all over the country, '68 [1968], '69 [1969], so I get there in '70 [1970], and the women at Newton have their own corridor for African American and Latino students. They have a whole--they cordoned off a whole part of a beautiful dorm, so then I move in there, and it--I loved the school, so what I do is, Ted [Wells' husband, HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.] and I had bought a car, told you, with all the summer earnings and everything, and he says that you keep the car with you, and on the weekends, I would drive up to Holy Cross [College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Massachusetts], study. All my friends were like, "You're not studying. You're going to see your boyfriend." My school was really very much of a commuter school. People would leave on the weekends, so I'd drive up on Friday night, take all my books, everything. Then when I graduated, I had Eunice Shriver [Eunice Kennedy Shriver] as my commencement speaker. When she said, "Nina Wells [HistoryMaker Nina M. Wells], cum laude," they were like, "Cum laude? You were really studying." I'm like, "I told you. You, you could not not study around Ted." You--he was just--everybody was going to all the concerts and everything. He'd go, "No, we're going to study." I go, "Really? I came all the way up here to study?" He was--there were semesters when Ted would get like a 4.0 [grade point average]. He majored in economics. My grades were great because I was just--you didn't have a choice. He was, he was totally motivated, which was really great, so transferring was really smart. And then in our senior year, we were actually going to wait until June to get married, and Ted was a finalist for the Rhodes Scholarship, and he was in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], and he called one of my--he called Diane [Diane Mitchell Hill], and he, he--my--Ted was so close to all my sisters, especially, Diane and Kathy [Kathy Mitchell Weaver], and he called and he says, "Diane, c'mon over and get a marriage license with me. Help me get a marriage license." He goes, "I think we're just going to get married now." So my sister dies laughing, "I'll be there. I'll be there. I'll be there." So she runs over and meets Ted. They go to Annapolis [Maryland] and get a marriage certificate, so--and this is in December 'cause he was in town for the Rhodes final, final, you know, interview, so he gets the license, and then in December of our senior year, Ted's family, like they had years before, was having dinner, one of Ted's best friends, his father is a minister, African Methodist [African Methodist Episcopal]. And he says, "I'm going to come over." We were going to get married in the Catholic church, and we went for the interviews and everything, and, you know, they, you know, we knew we needed to have a certain amount of money to get married in the church and then have a reception because my aunt said to me, "Don't get married unless you can have a nice reception." We had no money. We had no money. So we said, okay. We're, we're just going to get married on Christmas day at home at my mother's house, so we didn't tell anyone. We told my mother [Pearline Jackson Smith] that morning, but she knew from the night before. My brother had told her, so she made a wedding cake, and, basically, the minister came after dinner. It was just our immediate families and a few of Ted's friends from college, my sisters. The whole wedding was fifty dollars including the dress. I bought a dress in Newton [Newton Centre, Massachusetts] at Hit or Miss, it was fifteen dollars. My sister brought some carnations, some champagne. Ted borrowed a dashiki. In fact, I meant to have the picture here today. It's in the book 'Fraternity' [Diane Brady]. Do you know about the book 'Fraternity'?
Speaker 2: (No audible response).
Speaker 1: Well, there's a book that was written about Ted and five--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --students, yeah, right.
Speaker 2: You told me.
Speaker 1: And in there was a picture of the wedding. I meant to bring it. Had a white African gele on, so I got married that day, and we went to the Holiday Inn that night. And no honeymoon, and off we went. And the rest is history (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay we're going to change--
Story_ID: 667149
Speaker 1: What I was saying is that you're--the two of you are very focused. You're twenty- you're twenty-one, at that point, that you got (simultaneous)-- (Simultaneous) We are.
Speaker 2: --married.
Speaker 1: We are twenty-one.
Speaker 2: And then so you graduate [from Newton College of the Sacred Heart, Newton Centre, Massachusetts], as you said, cum laude, and then what, what is the decision at that point?
Speaker 1: At that point, of course, I had to do an extra semester, you know, and so Ted [Wells' husband, HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.] is, at that point, getting ready--applying to--
Speaker 2: Law school (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) law school, and I was going to actually apply to either school of education--or what is it? A master's in education or a master's in social work, and--because I had done--my undergraduate major was sociology, and I had done a thesis, 'Community Organization: Politics of the Poor' [ph.]. And I had organized tenants against unfair landlord practices in Roxbury, Massachusetts [Roxbury, Boston, Massachusetts], and I'd also taught at a community school in Roxbury for several years, and I thought--I wound up teaching, and student taught, and the feedback I got was, they said, "You, you're a born teacher. You really should pursue education." Had a wonderful principal at this community school, seventh and eighth grade, and that was really a tough, you know, student practice. And I said, you know, I'm so torn, although I loved organizing the tenants against unfair landlord practices, I loved teaching, and I was just so confused about whether I wanted social work or, or law. And Ted said, "Well, I'm applying to law school, and so do what you're going to do" (laughter), you know, right.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: So I--I said, I don't know--
Speaker 2: Keeps falling off.
Speaker 1: --about law school. I said, I don't know. I don't--I really didn't know any, any lawyers, and I said, I don't know. So finally I decided, I said, maybe it does make sense just to apply, so I applied to two law schools, Boston College and Suffolk University [Suffolk University Law School, Boston, Massachusetts], just two. And I got into both of them, and then Suffolk said--I said, "You know, I need to go to law school at night. I don't have any money." They gave me a grant of some kind. It was fairly substantial, so I said, okay. I'm gonna go at night. I said 'cause I don't know if I really want to be a lawyer. I'll just go at night and work during the day. I was admitted--social security had an honors program, and, basically, what they did was they brought you in at midlevel, so you didn't have to come in at an entry level, midlevel, and then you were sort of, you know, considered on a fast track. So I thought, hm, that sounds interesting. Why don't I do that? I'll, you know, have some money. I'll--and Ted was saying, "I'm going to borrow. I don't care. I'm going to go to Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts]. I don't care how much debt I have. I'm going to Harvard." And I'm like, all that debt. That's ridiculous. I don't want a lot of debt. I'll work during the day, I'll go to law school at night. I'll take this grant from Suffolk, and it will be fine, which was really not a good decision, I don't think, in the long run. And I didn't get any money from Boston College Law School [Newton Centre, Massachusetts], and Ted said, "Go over there and talk to the dean." And I said, "No. They didn't give me any money. I'm not going." I was really stubborn. I'm just going to work. And I said I love this honors program that I was admitted into, and I ended up at a social security office in Massachusetts, and I came in at a fairly high level, and I had a lot of people I was supervising that totally resented me. It was a very small office in a predominantly Caucasian neighborhood, kind of working class. So who is this black woman coming in? And now she's our boss. It was, it was, it was tough. It was tough. But you know what the toughest part was? The [U.S.] Social Security Administration took over the supplemental security program [Supplemental Security Income], which is basically the well pro- welfare program. They took it over. Social security had only administered the actual social security for old folks and disability, social security disability, if you'd worked and earned enough quarters of coverage. So it was really kind of a job that you could really manage during the day and then go to law school at night, but when the federal government decided social security does such a good job, let them take over the welfare program for everything except for Aid to Families with Dependent Children, so my caseload went from twenty to like, you know, a hundred overnight. It was crazy. And just trying to juggle that and try to leave on time to get to classes to go to law school, I said, this is ridiculous. So I talked to the dean, and he said, "Don't worry about it. We'll give you additional aid. You can switch into the day program. You can graduate in three years. You don't have to work full time." And I went to American University [Washington, D.C.] that summer, got enough credits to qualify me as a second year law student, so I--Ted said, "I'm leaving after--," he says, "I'm--in four years, I'm leaving in 1976. Are you coming?" I said, "I'll be finished by 1976." He was, he was just rigid. He knew what he wanted. He had a game plan, right. So I said, "Okay. I'm going to be--I'll go to AU. I'll get the credits. I'll do two years in the day program, and I'll graduate on time, and I will be--I'll be out of here with you." He goes, "C'mon," he goes, "'cause I'm going." He knew that joint program. He was going to be in Massachusetts. So I did graduate at the same time that he did, and then we--'cause he clerked, as you know, on the Third Circuit court of appeals [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]. But I should probably back up. I feel like I'm missing something.
Story_ID: 667150
Speaker 1: Well, you're--I mean, even the fact that you would go and study. So he's at Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts], and you would go over and study with him in the evenings (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: So you're working during the day?
Speaker 2: First year--
Speaker 1: First--
Speaker 2: --worked during the day, went to law school [Suffolk University Law School, Boston, Massachusetts] at night.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: And that was--
Speaker 1: It's a lot (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) that was--it was a struggle. It was tough. Particularly because the day was just so--got really crazy. And then the second two years, I just went to law school full time. And in the summer, we had some really great summer jobs. One summer in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], I worked for The Family Law Reporter at BNA. I don't know if you know that organization, Bureau of National Affairs. And then Ted [Wells' husband, HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.] was with Price Waterhouse [PricewaterhouseCoopers] one summer, and then, oh, I forget all the summer jobs, but we would--wherever I would go, he would go or vice versa, so we ended up being together. But, initially, graduating, when we got married, we still--I still had another semester of undergraduate school [at Newton College of the Sacred Heart, Newton Centre, Massachusetts], but we moved into a--an apartment in Somerville, Massachusetts, and that was kind of tough, tell you the truth, 'cause I left the dorm, and, you know, in some ways, everybody was like, "Oh, you're so lucky. You're getting to move into an apartment," but I had no idea how challenging it would be because all of the sudden, (laughter) here I am, what, am I twenty-one years old? I've left the college dorm. I gotta commute to school every day, and now I'm juggling laundry, shopping (laughter). I'm like, oh, I'm so lucky. Now I'm living in this apartment. It's freezing, it's--we couldn't afford the heat. It was like a--it was, it was a shock. I think that--it was very, very challenging just to get--find furniture and we moved in. I decorated the apartment. I made curtains. I made slipcovers, carpeted the floor, and I was like, I left a dorm with three meals a day (laughter).
Speaker 1: And you have your Volkswagen.
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You didn't have the old Volkswagen--
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no.
Speaker 1: --at that point?
Speaker 2: No. At that point--oh, we had the Volkswagen that we bought.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: I thought you meant the one my father [Ignatius Mitchell, Jr.] had.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.
Speaker 2: I grew up with a Volkswagen, and we had bought one--
Speaker 1: You--
Speaker 2: --through the Korean embassy.
Speaker 1: That's--
Speaker 2: Oh, you know everything. From the Korean embassy in D.C., we had bought a Volkswagen, and the Volkswagen actually conked out on us our last year of law school, and we had no money to buy another one. We went to the local bank. Ted had a letter from Judge John Gibbons [John J. Gibbons] saying, "You have a clerkship, you know, making twenty thousand dollars," whatever it was. And we took it to the bank, and we said, "Would you help us, please? We need a loan for a car." And there was a young banker, and he said, "You know what, I have faith in the two of you. I know you're going to be--you're in law school. You have a job with a, with a judge." He said, "I'll give you a loan." And that, that was our first bank loan that we ever got. But how do you like that, with a letter? It gave us real faith. You know, you know what, people really do, do wonderful things if you really show that you're, you know, honest and hardworking.
Story_ID: 667151
Speaker 1: What was the difference in your legal school education and Ted's [Wells' husband, HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.]? (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not a lot. People think there's a lot. And I spent a lot of time at Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] in classes, and many of his professors were equal or sometimes not as good or sometimes maybe a little bit better. I think the difference really was the perception about the people that were there, and some of the people were very smart, and some were average, and some were, you know, not so good. It was a complete mix, and it kind of changed my whole attitude 'cause at first, I thought, everybody there is like brilliant, and all the professors are amazing. Was not a whole lot of difference, but it was, it was just, you know, the--kind of the perception that if you went to Suffolk [Suffolk University Law School, Boston, Massachusetts], you weren't as smart as if you went to--as you--if you went to Harvard, but--
Speaker 1: Did both use the Socratic Method?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Absolutely (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) See, 'cause that's a lot of--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --the perception, too. You know, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Absolutely. Absolutely. And I had some wonderful professors that were just really, really great, really, really great, really smart, and they challenged us in the same way that, you know, students at Harvard were challenged.
Speaker 1: Right. So Nina [HistoryMaker Nina M. Wells], why were you saying that you made a mistake?
Speaker 2: Well, I think, you know, the way society views you, I think your pedigree makes a big difference in terms of every job you ever--(laughter) c'mon, let's face it. Pedigree, you know, you're Harvard. Pedigree, you, you had a presumption right off the bat that you're great. In my case, I always had to prove it. Every step of the way, you were challenged by people. "Where did you go do law school?" You know, right. Right to this day, I'm sixty-four years old, people still ask me where I went to law school. (Laughter) What difference does it make now? You know, but I do, I do tell people, you know, go to the best schools that you can get into.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Makes a difference.
Speaker 1: Good.
Speaker 2: That's the reality of our society today (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's true.
Story_ID: 667152
Speaker 1: Do you and Ted [Wells' husband, HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.] graduate the same year? No. Or are you grad- see, I'm con--
Speaker 2: We graduate--
Speaker 1: Law school (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) different years, different years from undergraduate but the same year from law school.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --nineteen seventy-six [1976].
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-six [1976].
Speaker 1: So your graduation is ahead of his.
Speaker 2: It is like a--by a week. But when I go--(laughter) I go to his law school, everybody wanted to know where my cap and gown is. I spent so much time there, and Ted gave me an ID, okay. I had my Harvard ID [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], go to the library, meet him there, do what I had to do, but we were a constant in the stacks. And I remember, Ted was being recruited like he was a star athlete for, for jobs, for law firms all over the country, and we would travel every weekend to a different--Atlanta [Georgia], Houston [Texas], San Francisco [California], L.A. [Los Angeles, California]. He was being, you know, recruited, and so I had a lot--I made a lot of friends at Harvard, obviously, and a lot of friends of, of--a lot of spouses were my friends as well, and I remember them coming over to me, saying, "Oh, hi, where you all going?" And Ted was always like so hard, he would be, "This is not a social setting. Shut up, everybody." I mean, right? So he would--we'd have to be in the stacks 'cause if we sat up on the main floors, everybody knew us, right?
Speaker 1: At Langdell [Langdell Hall, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: At Langdell, right. And so he would say, stacks. So we had these places we would hide out way down in the stacks, Saturdays and Sundays, 'cause, of course, the first year, he was business school exclusively, and that's the year where I was still, you know, in college [at Newton College of the Sacred Heart, Newton Centre, Massachusetts] and still working. And he had a study group, and they would meet at 7:30 in the morning. He'd get picked up at seven a.m., so soon after we were married, the reality really set in that I was going to have a very serious life. (Laughter) This was, this was serious. We both, you know, law degrees, and he's doing the business school, and it was challenging. It was different than it had been in college, very, very different because first of all, at the--at Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts], everybody was much older, and we were one of the few couples that had come right out of undergraduate school, so it was challenging at first because we didn't really, you know, relate to some of these old--we had some lovely people there we really got to know after a while, but, initially, they were like ten, sometimes fifteen years older than us, so, initially, it was--socially, it was a little difficult, and, you know, B school was tough, and he was working and going to law school, so it was challenging. Once I started going full time, then it got a lot better. I was really at Suffolk [Suffolk University Law School, Boston, Massachusetts] 'cause that was during the busing, the Boston busing.
Speaker 1: And, and that's a difficult period in Boston [Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: It was tough. And I rarely took public transportation anymore. I had started to, and then I said, you know, I can't even take public transportation anymore 'cause it was--everything was just so hostile, and there was some violence, so I spent--I would go to class and then leave. It was kind of too bad 'cause I really didn't spend as much time. I mean, I wrote for one of the publications on campus at the law school, but most of the time, I would finish my classes and bolt and go back over to Harvard 'cause it was a much more of a--what should I say, better environment--
Speaker 1: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) overall.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 667153
Speaker 1: So Suffolk [Suffolk University Law School, Boston, Massachusetts], how many, how many black females were in your class?
Speaker 2: Very few. In fact, I'm really close to one who lives in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] now, and my class--and we had the same size law school as Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], so we had five hundred students, and--
Speaker 1: Were you divided into--how many--how large--
Speaker 2: Sections, sections, sections (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) how large were your sections?
Speaker 2: Sections were about maybe 125 each section, and I think there were--in my, in my particular class, there may have been three African American women, two African American guys. It was really bad. That's why they encouraged me to come and gave me money to come. They were trying to be more diverse.
Speaker 1: The numbers were low.
Speaker 2: Horrible, really horrible. Then you went to Harvard, and you saw almost 10 percent, and it was like wonderful. It was like great. See why I spent so much time there? And just made friends with so many of the people there. It was a whole different climate and atmosphere completely.
Speaker 1: So, so did you--are you talking back and forth legal theory or your courses? Do you do any of that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And the other thing I should say, in my classroom at Suffolk, there was a certain level of hostility, the people who said to me, "You're not really going to use your law degree. You're going to get married and get pregnant." "My friend, who just graduated from Holy Cross [College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Massachusetts] wanted your seat, and you took it." Oh, it was, it was open hostility.
Speaker 1: Toward women.
Speaker 2: Towards women, and, particularly, African American women, definitely, yeah. So in terms of studying, yeah, we had some of the same courses, and, oh, yeah. When you got ready to start studying, we were like, okay, civil procedure. Help me out here. Or, you know, vice versa, and then there was a guy at Harvard, Emanuel [Steven L. Emanuel], and he did these--he was competing with the Gilbert [Gilbert Law Summaries], the Gilbert--
Speaker 1: Society?
Speaker 2: No, no, no (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 2: No, no. Remember the--
Speaker 1: Oh, the Gil--
Speaker 2: --study guides?
Speaker 1: --the Gil- right, right.
Speaker 2: So his name was--I forget his first name. His last name was Emanuel, and he published all of these great--
Speaker 1: Study guides.
Speaker 2: --study guides. And he asked me to be his salesperson in Suffolk (laughter). So I had my--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --own little business on the--selling these manuals. Not only did I sell them, I used them (laughter), I remember, for civil procedure. I'm like, I never could have made it through for some reason. But, yes, Ted [Wells' husband, HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.] and I were always--I mean, not only that, but his classmates, I mean, in the summer, one summer, we all went to D.C. to work, and one of his best friends from law school, Warren Jackson [T. Warren Jackson], they worked for Arnold and Porter [Arnold and Porter Kaye Scholer LLP], and I was a writer for the Bureau of National Affairs, Family Law Reporter [The Family Law Reporter], and all summer long, everything I was doing, bouncing it off of them, bouncing it off of them, you know, all kinds of, you know, legal stuff. Yeah. So we did. We studied together, absolutely. If I was taking a course similar to his, or he was taking one similar to mine, we always talked the law, all the time, you know; especially really difficult concepts, like, how did you figure out rule against perpetuities?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Explain that to me. And we'd, you know, share hornbooks. I remember he had great hornbooks, or I'd find a good hornbook, and I'd say, "Have you tried this? It's really good," yeah.
Story_ID: 667154
Speaker 1: Um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So what, what courses appeal to you, though? I mean, or did, did you gravitate to?
Speaker 1: Yeah. A lot of Article II, a lot of commercial law. And it was interesting that I ended up becoming a contracts lawyer specializing in contracts, had a great contracts professor, but then a great Article II professor as well, and I never thought that I would be--the problem is that because I had sort of a truncated experience with law school [Suffolk University Law School, Boston, Massachusetts] and didn't get a chance to do clinical programs, I was kind of a nervous wreck about practicing, and then my first job was as an assistant corporation counsel for the City of Newark [New Jersey], and I had to prosecute cases like my third day on the job. Somebody took me down and said, "This is how you prosecute cases," and he wrote out a couple notes on a yellow pad, and I said, "Okay." He goes--he introduced me to everybody and said, "I'm upstairs if you need me. I'll see you later." And I had 100 housing complaints that day, and all these housing inspectors raced over to me. "Are you the prosecutor? Are you the prosecutor? That landlord did this, and that landlord did that." And I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. And it was really surprising how comfortable I was immediately. And that, actually, I was before the chief judge, Judge Booker, Irvin Booker [Irvin B. Booker], and afterwards, he said, "Young lady, I like you. Who are you? And where, where did you go to law school? Where did you come from?" And I said, "Well, my husband came here to clerk," and blah, blah, blah. And he said, "I like your style." And from the very beginning, I got in sync with prosecuting cases. It was--I was shocked. 'Cause I had been really, you know, in law school--kind of quiet because here I was racing through the last two years, and didn't do like the clinical programs that other people were doing, so I was a little bit nervous. And from the day I got into the courtroom, I don't know what it was. I had a real comfort level. In fact, I stayed there several years, and then Ted [HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.] said, I would--he said, "I think you should go up to the county prosecutor's office. You're really great on your feet," blah, blah, blah. And, at that point, New Jersey Bell [New Jersey Bell Telephone Company; Verizon New Jersey, Inc.] was hiring. Jimmy Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] was president, and New Jersey Bell was hiring after I finished my stint at the corporation counsel's office, and I thought corporate law or the prosecutor's office? I just didn't think the two of us could try cases and have children. At that point, I had, had my daughter [Teresa Wells], and I thought, you know, I think corporate law may be the place for me.
Story_ID: 667155
Speaker 1: Nina [HistoryMaker Nina M. Wells] let me ask you about Newark [New Jersey] because, you know, not a lot of people would think of--you know, people are leaving law school. I mean, you could have stayed in Boston [Massachusetts]. You could have come to--back to D.C. [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Right, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You know, New York [New York].
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: Not many people--
Speaker 2: --oh, you don't know the story about this?
Speaker 1: No, no. I'm just--
Speaker 2: Oh, oh.
Speaker 1: Tell us the story.
Speaker 2: There is, there's a great story. There's a great story. So we leave law school, and like I said, Ted [HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.] was recruited because of the J.D./M.B.A. We had the pick of the entire United States of America, great firms, and Ted had spent a summer--we both did--in D.C., and then he had been in Atlanta [Georgia], split his summer between Atlanta and D.C., so we've been all over the country. And after we finished law school, we think, we're gonna go to California. California, we had all these friends from Southern California, and we thought, no more cold weather. We're going out to the West Coast, so we decided to drive cross country on the way out there, so we take about three weeks. We'd really never been very many places in the United States just because of working and everything, so--and then Ted's family didn't really travel a lot, and my family had been to just Niagara Falls [New York], Buffalo, New York. That was it. So cross country, we take the southern route. We go out. We spend about three weeks getting there. We get there. We're looking for an apartment. Well, being from D.C., we were looking for a very diverse neighborhood. We can't find a neighborhood that we can connect with. First of all, we'd been married now for, you know, six, almost seven years. Every place has a social director. We're like, why do we need a social director? We're old married people now. We wanted something very different, but we wanted a neighborhood where we felt like we could connect and feel really comfortable and feel, you know, some affinity to it. Well, we couldn't find that neighborhood, and the more we thought about it, the more we thought--well, first of all, I felt so far--after driving out there, it felt very different than flying, and we were like, you know, I don't know if we made the right decision, and then we saw an apartment, and we put a down--a, you know, put a down payment on it, and we said, you know, what? This isn't us. We don't like it out here. We just couldn't connect, so Ted had accepted at a law firm, Paul, Hastings and Janofsky [Paul, Hastings, Janofsky and Walker LLP; Paul Hastings LLP], and he never went into the firm. It took us like a couple of weeks to get up the nerve to tell them. He finally called them and said, "We're not going to come." But what happened was--tells you how interesting things are. When Ted clerked in Newark, a--he had met a partner at a law fi- Newark law firm at Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts]. And Ted gets on the elevator. He has on some fatigues, and looks like a--you know, this grungy college student, and the, the lawyer who was the partner at a firm said to Ted, "Now, what are you doing next year?" I don't know whether he was being sarcastic or what. And Ted said, "Oh, I'm just finishing up J.D./M.B.A., clerking on the Third Circuit court of appeals [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit] for John Gibbons [John J. Gibbons]." He was like, "Whoa, you're clerking for John Gibbons?" He says, "I have a law firm in Newark." He goes, "While you're clerking, can we have lunch?" They had lunch. Love at first sight. He said, "You have an offer. If you ever decide to practice law, you have a, you have a place at Lowenstein Sandler [Lowenstein, Sandler, Brochin, Kohl, Fisher and Boylan; Lowenstein Sandler LLP]. Please, let me know if you're interested." Well, Ted in California calls Dick Sandler [Richard M. Sandler], and says, "Dick, I don't like California. I'm coming back to Newark to East Orange [New Jersey] or--actually in East Orange, a suburb of Newark." And he said, "When do you want to start? Your salary will be X. We'll see you on Monday." So we got in the car. We told the firm, "Send all of our stuff back. We'll pay." 'Cause, of course, you're going to pay for it now. They didn't (laughter)--it was all junk on the truck. We had nothing. You know, nothing. So he calls Dick Sandler, and the big thing was, "Where were you," for years and years at the firm, "where were you when Ted Wells called? Where were you when Ted called and said he was coming?" Ted was the first non-New Jersey Harvard lawyer they'd ever had. Every other--they had lots of Harvard lawyers at the firm, but they were all from New Jersey, so here he is, D.C., okay. Here you are coming to Newark. People thought we had lost our minds, right. We had an apartment in East Orange. We called the landlord said, "We're coming back." And everybody said, "You all are scaring the heck out of us." But little did we know that we would become so involved in Newark, the corporation counsel, and then I went with New Jersey Bell [New Jersey Bell Telephone Company; Verizon New Jersey, Inc.] in Newark (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 667156
Speaker 1: And the other thing that--just, just to mention, is that you had tried D.C. [Washington, D.C.] at one point, and it was too complicated.
Speaker 2: It was.
Speaker 1: Right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. Well, we had gone back for several summers in D.C., and one summer we lived with Ted [HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.]--his mom [Phyllis Wells] and his sister [Toni Wells], it was really nice, but we--what we realized in the one summer we had lived at a hotel because Price Waterhouse [PricewaterhouseCoopers]--Ted was with Price- Price Waterhouse, and what we found was probably a little too much family and high school friends, and we thought that would be very distracting for us. At least we found it distracting with everyone saying, "Well, Sunday, of course, you're going to have dinner with us." You know, "Of course, you're going to go out on Friday night with the guys." "Of course, you're going to hang out with this group or that group all the time." And we had changed. We were very, very different people, and I think we knew that in order for our marriage to survive, we--that there were too many distractions. There were too many people wanting our time, you know.
Speaker 1: Well, you were--there was a lot of pride in both of you in going, too.
Speaker 2: Not only that, but we really thought, okay, Ted's parents were divorced. My parents [Pearline Jackson Smith and Ignatius Mitchell, Jr.] were divorced. One of the things I think we wanted was tranquility, no upheaval, no dysfunction. Let's just stay focused. And we had actually written our vows. It took us, I think, three or four legal pages of a legal pad. I mean, we had long vows. We thought about it, and we thought about it, and we wrote them, and they last forever, and we recorded it, but you couldn't hear it because Ted's mother was crying so loudly that (laughter) you couldn't hear the vows. I wish we could find those pieces of paper now. But we really thought about marriage in a very serious way, I think more so than a lot of twenty-one year olds really do and--'cause a lot of it had to do with what we wanted to accomplish as young African Americans who had been given such a great opportunity to go to college when we went to college, 1968. The world was in a tailspin, right, and here we were, recipients, you know. We're going to college. Our parents hadn't gone to college. Neither did Ted's parents, his father [Theodore V. Wells, Sr.] only finished like seventh grade. So for us, this was like this unique opportunity, so we tended to be a little more serious than a lot of other students, and then our life in Boston [Massachusetts] was so interesting. We were meeting all these super accomplished people, and we felt, you know, D.C. is great, but so many of our friends that grew up in D.C. never left D.C., and their world seemed so small, and we felt like, oh, my gosh. There's so many opportunities out there, and there's so much that we can possibly accomplish if we go beyond our neighborhoods and the cool kid parties and stuff. And one of the things in California, we were, we were saying, you know, well, how do people get involved in the community? We were hearing more about the social part of it and not as much about the philanthropic, and we had--don't forget, we had spent a year in Newark [New Jersey], and so we were beginning to feel as if, you know, there's so much to be done. Like one of Ted's partners asked us to join the board of the Newark Day Center [Newark, New Jersey], the oldest nonprofit in New Jersey, and they had a senior citizen center, and they did the Fresh Air Fund, and they had a wonderful early childhood program, so at twenty some years old, we're going on all these nonprofit boards. I've worked--and when I joined the phone company [New Jersey Bell Telephone Company; Verizon New Jersey, Inc.], the vice president for public affairs and HR [human relations] came in my office, and he said, "The culture here is to get involved in the community," and he says, "we want you to go on the United Way allocations board [United Way of Essex and West Hudson, Newark, New Jersey]." And I'm like, wait a minute now. I'm thinking to myself, at that point, I had two children under two years of age. Okay, two. One was an infant [Phillip Wells] and one was two [Teresa Wells], and my kids are only twenty-two months apart. Ted is all of the sudden working like a maniac, and they're asking me to get involved in the community. I'm like, oh, this is going to be interesting. But I said, it makes sense. So I did. I joined it. And, as a result, really, from the very beginning became immersed in the social services nonprofit community of New Jersey at a very young age, and I have a mentor, Ted's mentor, the partner at his firm that, the head partner who, who actually started the firm [Lowenstein, Sandler, Brochin, Kohl, Fisher and Boylan; Lowenstein Sandler LLP]. He said to us, "Lawyers just don't practice law. They get involved in the community." So right away, we were like, oh, this had a comfort level--
Speaker 1: So, so--
Speaker 2: --right away.
Speaker 1: --so what was his name, the head partner?
Speaker 2: Alan Lowenstein [Alan V. Lowenstein].
Speaker 1: Alan Lowenstein.
Speaker 2: Alan Lowenstein.
Story_ID: 667157
Speaker 1: So you move there in '76 [1976].
Speaker 2: Seventy-six [1976].
Speaker 1: And then the da- your daughter Teresa [Teresa Wells] is born.
Speaker 2: In '78 [1978].
Speaker 1: In '78 [1978] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Seventy-eight [1978], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. And in that time period, you're working for--
Speaker 2: Corporation counsel's office, yes.
Speaker 1: So who's mayor at this point?
Speaker 2: Ken Gibson [HistoryMaker Kenneth Gibson].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Ken Gibson is the mayor, uh-huh (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, so this is an interesting time, too, because--
Speaker 2: He's the first African American mayor. In fact, I just finished the book 'Inside Newark' ['Inside Newark: Decline, Rebellion, and the Search for Transformation'] written by a wonderful guy, Bob Curvin [Robert Curvin]. And he talks about, you know, just how that happened in Newark [New Jersey], and who were the people that really, really, you know, were active and got involved and--'cause Addonizio [Hugh Addonizio] was Italian, and he was the last Caucasian mayor that we've had in Newark, so he talks about, you know, just the, the progression and the changes. So I'm in corporation counsel's office for two years. I have Teresa (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And how are you finding, how are you finding--what are you learning in that office? You talk about, you know, you start--
Speaker 2: Being a prosecutor.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you said that, you know, you have this hundred cases, so is there a diversity to it? And how many (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah. Well, that was one of the things you did.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You did that part time, and, basically, you sat in your office, and they would call up. We need a prosecutor. But most of the time, you had other responsibilities, and mine were amazingly, the legal advisor to the Newark city planning board [Newark Central Planning Board]. Like, what would--did I know coming out of law school [Suffolk University Law School, Boston, Massachusetts] to advise the planning board with all the development going on in Newark? I was also the legal advisor to the real estate commission, and the real estate commission bought and sold all the city owned property, and in some cases, we would have auctions, and there would be problems, and we would have jury trials, and I would try those cases. I also did a lot of the foreclosures. I did chancery work. I was one of the lead attorneys in chancery, and many of the foreclosures during the time--that was post riots, so a lot of businesses were leaving Newark, and there were a lot of foreclosures, and I was the legal advisor on all of those foreclosures and all of the chancery work as well, so I had a very diverse practice. A number of other boards and commissions reported, you know, to me, and it was an opportunity to do a little bit of everything. Great group of lawyers, some very experienced, had been there many, many, many, years. In fact, we had a great big law library, and we'd go in there almost every afternoon and just consult with the other lawyers. "Okay. Tomorrow is motion day. You gave me this motion. Tell me what I'm looking for." There was an African American number two, the corporation counsel was a guy by the name of Sal Perillo [Salvatore Perillo], a very smart lawyer. The number two was a guy by the name of John Teer [ph.], who had been a judge and was retired, and he was like my mentor, and he would give me, you know, a really big, you know, case and then shepherd me through it. But great experience, great exposure, and--but I got to the point where, you know, there were a lot of things going on in the City of Newark, and there were a lot of investigations around fraud and conflicts of interest, and I was asked to represent employees before the grand jury, and at that point, we said, I'm out. It was a little, little too much. And there were a lot of investigations about members of the real estate commission and whether or not they had taken bribes. In fact, one guy did end up going--city council member, ended up going to prison, so New Jersey Bell [New Jersey Bell Telephone Company; Verizon New Jersey, Inc.] was hiring.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So before you, before you leave that though--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: But so Ken Gibson, he's--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the first black mayor.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And he came in '76 [1976] or '72 [sic. 1970]?
Speaker 2: No, no. He came in--let's see. I--by the time I got there--
Speaker 1: He had been there--
Speaker 2: --he had been there several years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--but don't forget he did have three terms, so I left, and then, you know--
Speaker 1: So who--in terms of black mayors, he was--'cause you have--
Speaker 2: He was the first.
Speaker 1: --Patrick [ph.]--no.
Speaker 2: In, in--
Speaker 1: In New Jersey, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In New Jersey--oh, no.
Speaker 1: --but, but--
Speaker 2: 'Cause we had--
Speaker 1: --you have Hatcher [HistoryMaker Richard Hatcher] who was first black mayor.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: So then I can't remember the--
Speaker 2: And then don't forget (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) order, but he--
Speaker 2: --and then D.C. [Washington, D.C.], you had, well, of course, Walter Washington.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But that was a whole different, you know, system of government then.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Remember, you have Walter Washington--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --was also in D.C. Well, D.C.--yeah. And then you had--well, did--
Speaker 1: Was Barry [HistoryMaker Marion Barry] in (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In Cleveland [Ohio]. Didn't we have--
Speaker 1: We had Stokes.
Speaker 2: Mayor Stokes.
Speaker 1: Mayor Stokes.
Speaker 2: Stokes.
Speaker 1: So 'cause--
Speaker 2: Out of Cleveland.
Speaker 1: So Gibson--because Chicago [Illinois] doesn't come in until later.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: It doesn't come in until the '80s [1980s] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right. But we did have Stokes.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay.
Speaker 2: And at that point, we didn't have--Maynard Jackson came later, too.
Speaker 1: He came later.
Speaker 2: A little bit later, right. But, yeah, Carl Stokes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: And his daughter is a reporter in, in New Jersey [sic.].
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Did you know that?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.
Story_ID: 667158
Speaker 1: So, but the good thing about--that you should--or I don't know if you should emphasize, but you are getting a lot of experience at corporat- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A lot.
Speaker 1: A lot of experience.
Speaker 2: A lot of exposure and a lot of experience. I mean, trying--I mean, I tried all the non indictable cases. Anything that was non indictable, I tried. But, of course, those weren't really complicated cases. I mean, they were, you know, drunk driving, lewdness, adulterated food, I mean, assault and battery, you know, less than twenty-five grams of marijuana, but, still, I had done no clinical programs. And I was on my feet constantly trying those cases, also the chancery work was very, very interesting as well, and I, I spent a lot of time in chancery court getting to know the chancery processes, procedures, and the judges 'cause I had a lot of great relationships with judges. I remember one judge, you know, just doing, you know, gun permits, you know, and, and him saying to me, you know, "Who are you?" There was a wonderful community of African American lawyers in New Jersey, very embracing. When Ted [Wells' husband, HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.] and I became members of the bar, there were probably maybe a hundred African American lawyers total. And very quickly, we became members of the Garden State Bar Association, and I also became a member of the Association of Black Women Lawyers [Association of Black Women Lawyers of New Jersey], which started the year I came into New Jersey. So we started practicing with a very close knit group of great attorneys, and we had mentors like Ray, Raymond A. Brown, who was one of the famous African American lawyers in the country, so here we are with this closest knit group of people, and the Garden State Bar decides to do something philanthropic at a meeting, and they say, "Well, Ted and I--would you host it at your home?" So very early on, we became part of this wonderful network that decided that as young lawyers, we needed to have an impact on something bigger than ourselves. It was interesting how everybody really kind of came together around those themes, yeah.
Speaker 1: So who are some of these people that you're meeting of this, you know, group?
Speaker 2: Well, there was a guy by the name [HistoryMaker] Junius Williams. Now, Junius was Yale Law School [New Haven, Connecticut], he was in Newark [New Jersey]. He actually came to Newark as part of the SDS. He was really what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Student defense?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: Oh, SDS.
Speaker 2: SDS, that was the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.
Speaker 1: No, SNCC.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Students for a Democratic Society (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Society. Students for a Democratic Society.
Speaker 1: Students for a Democratic Society.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: Thank you. Okay.
Speaker 1: Right. That's exactly it, yeah. And they came into Newark after the riots to see what role they could play. And actually, Junius Williams is still in Newark. He started a organization, Abbott Institute [Abbott Leadership Institute, Newark, New Jersey] for--really helping parents navigate through the Newark Public Schools.
Story_ID: 667159
Speaker 1: So who were some of the other people? I don't think the other people--a guy by the name of Arthur Martin, who we thought was going to run for [U.S.] Congress, who went to Georgetown Law School [Georgetown University Law School; Georgetown University Law Center, Washington, D.C.] and Holy Cross [College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Massachusetts] with Ted [Wells' husband, HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.]. He was a prosecutor for a while. No one really--I mean, Donald Payne [Donald M. Payne] was here really working more with the Y [Young Men's Christian Association], and then he decided to challenge Congressman Rodino [Peter W. Rodino], and we never had an African American representing New Jersey, so--and that's some of the, some of the things that Garden State Bar [Garden State Bar Association] did. We weren't political, but there were a core group of people--Gus Heningburg was a wonderful person who was a great community activist, and he and number of other people started a black PAC [political action committee] where they were giving money to black elected officials, so I would say there was just a core group of business leaders and, in particular, young lawyers, but we were all young lawyers, and you didn't--wouldn't recognize really a lot of the names to tell you the truth, but people really had a sense of--I mean, Ray Brown, Raymond A. Brown, was probably the most famous. And we came together around sort of some real core issues of diversity in the court. We felt like we saw too many defendants who were African American and not enough judges, so there was a real period where we had--there was a huge taskforce on minorities and the courts, and also of us participated on the various panels, and subgroups, and as a result, you really did see an increase in the number of African American judges, and number of African American lawyers practicing in federal court, prosecutor's office, county prosecutors, as well as U.S. attorney's office, so we saw a real sea change from 1976. It probably started a little bit before that. But you know what the biggest change was? Rutgers University [Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, Newark, New Jersey]. Their law school [Rutgers Law School, Newark, New Jersey] has the most aggressive affirmative action program in the United States. They have a program, and, actually, you'd be surprised by some of the amazing graduates. Bob Menendez, for example, came through that program. It's a program where they--the admissions takes into consideration LSAT and grades, but also life experiences, extracurricular, community service, and other accomplishments, and I actually did run that program for one year, but it is the most aggressive affirmative action program in the country, and it has withstood constitutional challenge. It was challenged the year after I left. The Federalist Society [Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies], they took issue with it, and it turned out to be a phenomenal program, and many of the judges, legislators and great lawyers in New Jersey came out of that program, yeah, MSP, Minority Student Program, at Rutgers University law school (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At Rutgers, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 667160
Speaker 1: I want to also understand, what is Newark [New Jersey] like at this point in time? Because, you know, it--you know, you think of Newark, you know, as Detroit [Michigan] and other places that got hurt by the riots.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So what is the community that you're--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --coming into?
Speaker 2: Okay. And like I said, I did join New Jersey Bell [New Jersey Bell Telephone Company], which was in Newark on Broad Street, and inside of the corporate offices, almost all Caucasian. Senior management, you have all the major corporations in New Jersey--
Speaker 1: You joined New (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) Prudential [Prudential Insurance Company of America; Prudential Financial, Inc.].
Speaker 1: --Jersey Bell in what year? I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: I, I joined New Jersey Bell in 1979.
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-nine [1979].
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-nine [1979] 'cause my son was born in 1980, and they hired me pregnant, which was pretty unheard of.
Speaker 1: So you have Teresa [Teresa Wells]--
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: --one year, and a year later you have--
Speaker 2: Well, twenty-two months later, I had Phillip [Phillip Wells]. I had Teresa in 1978, Phillip in 1980. I forget the years, yeah. But New Jersey Bell, they--Jimmy Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] was president, and, as you will recall, he said I want Corporate America to look like America. In Newark--and it hasn't changed that much, inside of the major corporations of New Jersey, of Newark--in Newark, Prudential, they've done a pretty good job. New Jersey Bell, which is now Verizon [Verizon New Jersey, Inc.], Blue Cross and Blue Shield [Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, Newark, New Jersey]--Verizon, Blue Cross Blue Shield, major corporations, at that time, there are almost no African Americans at all. From the board, senior executives, they're not there. Newark is clearly in transition. You still have some of the major department stores still there. You have a Bamberger's [L. Bamberger and Company], you have a Hanes [Hanes Group; Hanesbrands Inc.], but basically, there's not a whole lot going on downtown because of the riots had occurred, and in the aftermath, you've lost a lot of businesses. You've lost a lot of the middle class, and you have a lot of white flight out to the suburbs. So Newark is very, very challenged at that point. You still have the major high rise projects, and you feel a real sense of isolation in the community and not a lot of connection to the more affluent suburbs; however, one of the governors decided--
Speaker 1: Which governor?
Speaker 2: Governor Kean, Governor Tom Kean [Thomas Kean] decided, this is our largest city, we cannot allow there not to be major venues. There is the Newark Museum [Newark, New Jersey], which when I started, you know, taking my kids to the museum, I didn't have to go to New York [New York]. It is a world class museum in downtown Newark, which nobody knows about. A lot of people don't, more will now. And he decided we're going to build a performing arts center here in Newark [New Jersey Performing Arts Center], and that was huge. But for that, I don't know that Newark would still be on the map the way it is today. The performing arts center made such a difference, and then later, the Prudential Center [Newark, New Jersey] came, but that came much later. Sharpe James really, you know, gets a lot of credit for that--for the Prudential Center. But a lot of citizens thought, what a waste of money, don't do that. What happened to Newark around the '70s [1970s] was, late '60s [1960s], '70s [1970s], they brought a major highway through, chopped up the neighborhoods, built a big medical school [New Jersey College of Medicine and Dentistry; University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Newark, New Jersey], displaced a lot of residents. There was a lot of displacement, so a lot of middle class people moved to East Orange [New Jersey] and to West Orange [New Jersey]. Whom you left in the city was poor people. You left a lot of poor people in Newark, and with no--really no options whatsoever. With a school system that was taken over around that time or a little bit later by the state, so you had just a lot of dysfunction, quite frankly. And Ken Gibson's [HistoryMaker Kenneth Gibson] last--at the end of his term, he was challenged, and then, of course, Sharpe James came in, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And there was challenges of corruption and (unclear).
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Everything, everything. And then Sharpe James came in. He was on the city council [Newark City Council], and people thought he was going to be sort of the new messiah, and shortly after he came into office, people saw that he had a Rolls-Royce, he had boats. He had property everywhere, and it just disillusioned people, I think, early on. They said, "Oh, we thought we were going to have a new regime, and things were really going to be different," and Newark continued just to struggle and struggle and struggle.
Story_ID: 667161
Speaker 1: But Jimmy Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] was president. He wanted New Jersey Bell [New Jersey Bell Telephone Company; Verizon New Jersey, Inc.] to diversify. They hired three white women and myself in the same year, and we--you know, there was only one African American in the legal department, and there were no women, and so we came in at an interesting time, but still a very challenging time because the clients were, you know, surprised, and when you were assigned to a particular department, they were like, "You're kidding me. Really?" (Laughter) Black--you know, "A young black woman lawyer is our lawyer?" But for the most part, it was pretty smooth sailing. We had good leadership there. Bernie Hartnett [Bernard Hartnett] was my general counsel, and it, it--yeah, it was pretty smooth sailing 'cause I had my mentors, too, outside (laughter) that were helpful. And I had a few clients that wanted nothing to do with me, but for the most part, great experience. So here's Ted [Wells' husband, HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.] at a law firm [Lowenstein, Sandler, Brochin, Kohl, Fisher and Boylan; Lowenstein Sandler LLP]. He was getting really good training because he was working with all these great partners. I, you know, was sort of on my own, so I had to develop colleagues who had similar positions with other corporations and companies, so--and the Garden State Bar [Garden State Bar Association] was a good source of that as well because, you know, you found people--okay. You were doing very--I was doing very intricate contracts for all of the huge computer systems and then software development contracts. The very first software development contract I did was to eliminate the long distance operator. I don't know if you remember that, but you used to have to call a long distance operator and give her the phone number. Then my software program that I worked on, negotiated, you pressed a button. Then you by--there was no more long distance operator. How many people did I put out of work with--and I did that deal with a young couple who had developed--two young people, and the girlfriend was their lawyer--who had developed that program in their garage. Oh, yeah. Back in the old days, remember now, we had a lot of software development coming out of the garages, right. And that was one of the programs, so I did that for many years with the phone company. I did all of their real estate, buying and selling all their real estate, but don't forget, I had gotten--had some experience at the corporations counsel's office doing real estate, and then I did house closings as well, on my own, as like a private attorney, but I bought and sold all the real estate for New Jersey Bell. I did all their land use approvals for all of their, you know, board adjustment, planning board approvals throughout the entire State of New Jersey, and did all their easements and leases. I mean, I did huge lease negotiations for them, and I had a real knack for contracts. I did standard--I, I made most--the biggest binder of standard contracts you'd ever seen in your life. We changed the whole concept of contracts, and I would do them with the most favorable terms, put the logo on it, and then we went out for competitive bid. I said, "That's it. Take it or leave it." Sometimes they would take it. Most of the time they would take it. Sometimes we would have to negotiate some of the terms, the big terms, indemnification and terms like that, so I became a real contracts expert. So when the Bell system broke up, the president of the new R and D company [Bell Communications Research, Inc.; Telcordia Technologies, Inc.] asked me to go with him because he wanted the contract expertise, contracts real estate expertise. So I was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Cough) Because--
Speaker 1: --very lucky. I had a niche, you know, which helped me.
Speaker 2: But that, that--I mean, that was good to have that niche back then (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was wonderful to have that niche.
Story_ID: 667162
Speaker 1: Now I was promoted pretty consistently, and then I hit my head on the wall, on a wall because I needed to go to D.C. [Washington, D.C.]. What happened was, after the divestiture of the Bell system--
Speaker 2: So, so the breakup of, of Ma Bell occurs in 1980. You start--I mean, I don't know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No. It start--it occurred after that.
Speaker 2: Well, the, the verdict came down.
Speaker 1: Was it 1980?
Speaker 2: I know that for a fact 'cause Jenner and Block.
Speaker 1: I thought, I thought it was, it was a few years later.
Speaker 2: I, I'm almost--
Speaker 1: We got to Google it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I think it was a few years later.
Speaker 2: Okay. Because--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He won--
Speaker 1: It was a few (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) the case.
Speaker 1: It was a few years later.
Speaker 2: Maybe the--maybe it started, but the case was won in 1980 because Jenner was handling that case, MCI [MCI Communications Corp.; Verizon Communications, Inc.] against AT&T [AT&T Inc.].
Speaker 1: But they also had a Chicago [Illinois] firm.
Speaker 2: It was Jenner and Block.
Speaker 1: No, it wasn't.
Speaker 2: Oh, it wasn't?
Speaker 1: Unh-unh. I'm going to Google it--
Speaker 2: Okay. Okay.
Speaker 1: --in a minute, but it wasn't 1980--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --'cause the year my son was born was the year I started, so it was later than that, but, anyway, my--so I did go with the new R and D company on rotation, on rotation, and--
Speaker 2: Now, how, how was, how was, how was it broken up? Can you describe--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: --that? So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Absolutely. All of the operating companies were then considered independent of AT&T. AT&T stayed, all the operating companies were then divested. They were all then independent companies with no relationship to AT&T, so the operating companies now had no affiliation with Bell Laboratories [AT&T Bell Laboratories, Inc.; Nokia Bell Labs] or with Western Electric [Western Electric Company], so they needed research and development, so a new company called Bellcore was formed as a joint venture to provide all of the research and development for the independent divested phone companies, so that's the company that I went with. I went with Bell Communications Research [Bell Communications Research, Inc.; Telcordia Technologies, Inc.] after divestiture.
Speaker 2: So what is the relationship, just for my edification between Bell- Bell- Bellcore and Bell Labs?
Speaker 1: No relationship.
Speaker 2: There's no relationship?
Speaker 1: No relationship. Bell Laboratories was--did all the R and D for all the phone companies and AT&T. Once AT&T divested all the operating companies, they no longer had any relationship to Bell Labs. The new Bellcore was then the joint venture. Okay. So the operating companies could no longer use any of the services of AT&T, which was Bell Labs. Does that make sense? So I was with the new R and D joint venture company. And one of the big things we did was antitrust to ensure that the companies were not doing things together that would have created antitrust violations. But, but don't forget. They needed all the R and D, but they just couldn't talk about prices. They couldn't talk about all the things that would have created antitrust issues, but before they could because they were owned by AT&T, and they could do all of that. So, anyway, so then I joined--all right. But my problem was that in the divestiture, all the operating companies then formed regional companies. Remember NYNEX [NYNEX Corporation], Verizon [Verizon Wireless]? They formed regional companies, all these big regional companies, so it was Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland--D.C., Maryland, and Virginia. The, the--you could only have one top general counsel. My general counsel was not the one that was chosen. It was Bob Levitown [ph.] out of the D.C., so, obviously, the D.C. people had a leg up. D.C., Maryland, and Virginia people had a leg up in terms of promotions. If you wanted to go to D.C., and work for Bob Levitown, you could, and that would have opened a door potentially. But at that point, I had two small children [Teresa Wells and Phillip Wells]. Ted [Wells' husband, HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.] was totally committed at Lowenstein Sandler [Lowenstein, Sandler, Brochin, Kohl, Fisher and Boylan; Lowenstein Sandler LLP]. There was no movement. I had no way to move. If I could have moved, I would have had an opportunity to then move up 'cause some of those people who were in legal became general counsels and presidents of the company, so I'm just stopped at the--at a, at a fairly high level, but below vice president, below, below. And nothing--there's nothing I could do at that point, which was really unfortunate, but I, I always said to my kids that, that--when they say, "Oh, you compromised for us." I said, "No, I made choices. I made choices." And I wasn't going to move the family, and Ted wasn't in a position to move.
Speaker 2: So what year was this (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And women obvi- women often are confronted--
Speaker 2: That's right, with those choices.
Speaker 1: --with, with those choices, yeah.
Speaker 2: So what year was this?
Speaker 1: The--that, that would have been the year after divestiture, and so I really have to check--
Speaker 2: We'll look that up.
Speaker 1: --because I think it was, I think it was 19--I think it was more like 1984 and 1985, but I could be wrong.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: No, I'm saying the case got awarded to break it up, but the divestiture--
Speaker 1: Didn't occur (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) took some years.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 2: It took some years.
Speaker 1: It took some years. That's right. I, I need to Google 'cause you're right. My years aren't--I'm not as good with year--
Story_ID: 667163
Speaker 1: So what happens at that point then? What do you do at that point?
Speaker 2: Oh, I go, I go to Bell Communications Research [Bell Communications Research, Inc.; Telcordia Technologies, Inc.] with Roc Marano [Rocco J. Marano] who's the president of New Jersey Bell [New Jersey Bell Telephone Company; Verizon New Jersey, Inc.]. He then becomes president. I go over there on rotation for about four years.
Speaker 1: So that's a startup, sort of, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, very much so (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So that's exciting.
Speaker 2: It was--oh--it was extremely exciting, and it was down the street from my house. It was in Livingston, New Jersey, a nice easy commute 'cause, you know, with my kids [Teresa Wells and Phillip Wells] in school around--I wanted to always be fairly close, you know, to be able to get to the schools or whatever. So I stay there for about another four or five years, and then there's an opportunity--
Speaker 1: So what, what is the work that you do there? I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: It's primarily antitrust, it was primary--antitrust, counseling of clients, you had your own client group, and everything they did you reviewed to ensure that you're in no way violating Robinson-Patman [Robinson-Patman Act of 1936] or any of the antitrust laws, and also some environmental work I did and general corporate counseling as well.
Speaker 1: You know what's interesting, I'm, I'm fascinated with the diversity of your career to this point (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm so fortunate, so fortunate.
Speaker 1: I mean, at that point, even at that point 'cause you start--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --out litigating. Then you go corporate. Then you're doing antitrust work.
Speaker 2: Yeah. I really was very, very for- my career has been very, very interesting, and for me that was great because I always wanted something new and more challenging all the time.
Story_ID: 667164
Speaker 1: But the most challenging thing then happens. Okay, so I'm at New Jersey Bell [New Jersey Bell Telephone Company; Verizon New Jersey, Inc.], and there's a change in leadership in, in Trenton [New Jersey]. Mayor--I mean, not mayor, but Governor Jim Florio [James Florio] becomes the governor. This is probably 1990, and he selects someone that I know very well to be the public advocate in the cabinet, and he has five--the public advocate has five divisions, and one is called rate counsel, and, basically, you're responsible for representing consumers in regulated utility cases, so on behalf of all consumers, all the regulated utilities in New Jersey; gas, electric, water, health insurance, car insurance. Did I say health insurance? Did I say that?
Speaker 2: You said it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Water, gas, electric, all the regulated utilities, solid waste. You are the consumer representative on behalf of all citizens to ensure that all the rates are appropriate. So every time there's a rate filing, you go in with your team. The utility pays one tenth of 1 percent of their gross revenues in the year before they file, so you have a budget, you have consultants, and you have twenty lawyers. That's the office I took over after leaving the phone company. After leaving the phone company, first they said, "Well, maybe you could just be on sabbatical," and I said no because I'm--I'll be challenging, and one of the areas was telecommunications. I said, "No, I'll be on the other side of the table." But the public advocate [New Jersey Department of the Public Advocate] was a statute enacted in 1974 to give a voice to the voiceless, and the first public advocate in New Jersey was a great man by the name of Stanley Van Ness, and he was appointed by Governor Byrne. Governor Brendan Byrne appointed him, African American, brilliant lawyer. And you wore two hats, public advocate and public defender, and it was a phenomenal piece of legislation. Think about it. The utility had to set aside funding for me to challenge their rate filing, and we went through every line on that budget, and we had--well, if they had nuclear plants, we had nuclear experts, accountants, you name it. Everything was challenged. So I spent the next three and a half years until my commissioner, the public advocate, left the Florio administration. I did that job for three and a half years in Newark [New Jersey]. I came back to Newark, very challenging, especially with my, my kids because you worked seven days a week. You were basically negotiating the settlements with these cases with the CEOs of all of the utilities companies, very high profile, everything covered by the media, you know, splashes in the newspaper, whether you were going to close a nuclear plant, or whether you were going to roll back rates for the water company, huge. So after spending all that time with the New Jersey Bell, it was a great, great opportunity, but extremely challenging as you can imagine. So that was subcabinet.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That was a subcabinet--
Speaker 2: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) position.
Speaker 2: --so, so how old, how old are your kids [Teresa Wells and Phillip Wells] at this point? Are they like--
Speaker 1: At that point, they're, they're--
Speaker 2: --five--
Speaker 1: At that point, I'll tell you because when I left the position, when my commissioner left, six months before Florio left office, I--at that point, my children were seventh grade and ninth grade.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They were going into seventh grade and ninth grade, so that just shows you. Back up almost four years, so I had like a fourth grader and a, and a sixth grader. Okay. Or a third grader and a fifth grader, so they would go with me on weekends to work, and we'd work a few hours. Then I'd take them to tennis lessons, and--but my kids played every sport that you could possibly imagine, and we had every type of activity, and Jack and Jill [Jack and Jill of America, Inc.], so they always had a lot going on even if I was at work, they were at ballet, or they were at, you know, tennis, or something.
Speaker 2: And you said this had been made easier because you have live in care.
Speaker 1: I did. I did have that until they were about--until they were about--I think they were fourteen, maybe thirteen and fifteen, and I decided they needed something different, so I had a young college student come in, in the afternoons, and then she had a car, so she could take them and pick them up because they were in so many sports and activities and lessons and programs at that point.
Speaker 2: Right. Good.
Speaker 1: But I--it was--I had it pretty, pretty easy during that period except when you--when your wonderful housekeeper of five years would leave, then you, you know, have, have five in one year, and you just wanted to like--right, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) You wanted to kill yourself.
Speaker 1: Right, exactly. It was horrible.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay. We're going to change.
Speaker 1: It was rough--
Story_ID: 667165
Speaker 1: I want to go back to Jim Flor- Florio [James Florio].
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: He was the first Italian American governor, right? That's in, in New Jersey.
Speaker 2: I, I believe so.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I believe so.
Speaker 1: So what was his (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Very smart, very good, very good, very smart man, and he was the first one to say, "You know what, we've got to do things differently in terms of how we fund our schools and education." And he raised taxes to do that, and, you know, there was quite a backlash. Bill Bradley almost lost his seat in the United States Senate because he did not come out and say what Jim Florio had done was wrong. He, he in no way got involved with that, and people were very, very angry, and they wanted him to say he shouldn't have done that. 'Cause the courts came along later and mandated, if he had waited, it was going to be court mandated.
Speaker 1: Okay. Done what?
Speaker 2: The funding. The way that we fund schools. He changed the way we funded schools. Typically, it was just the revenues from the taxes in your community, but poor communities had less revenue--
Speaker 1: But you should talk (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) to support the schools.
Speaker 1: --you should talk about this because I--as I was reading about it, I was thinking, Chicago [Illinois], maybe other places do it, but it was sort of groundbreaking what he did, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Absolutely groundbreaking.
Speaker 1: --explain that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, and the fact that he had a $2.8 billion tax increase at some point. Okay.
Speaker 2: He did. He did. Actually, two things really happened in New Jersey that were really kind of revolutionary. One was the Abbott v. Burke decision [Abbott v. Burke, 1985] that basically said we had to publicly fund three and four year olds to attend preschool in New Jersey. That would be publicly funded that all three and four year olds in New Jersey, Abbott v. Burke, huge decision. And now you see around the country--it was kind of very popular but that was early on. Jim Florio, Governor Florio, was very much of a visionary, and really, really, believed that the way that we were funding our schools was absolutely discriminatory and really hurt children from poor communities, so he decided--and, fortunately, the court ended up mandating this. Politically, he lost his governorship because he said, "No, wealthier communities have to help subsidize the educational system in poor communities." Actually, New Jersey has had some--a lot of other really creative decisions as well, and another one was the Mount Laurel decision [Southern Burlington County NAACP v. Mount Laurel Township, 1975]. I would say Abbott, that--Abbott v. Burke and the Mount Laurel decision that basically said every community has to set aside a certain percentage of their housing for low income families, which, in New Jersey, we have seven hundred- 650 municipalities. That did not go over very well at all. That was a supreme court decision [New Jersey Supreme Court]. But Jim Florio was very, very courageous in the sense that he just said, "No, we cannot allow there to be disproportionate funding for our schools in New Jersey." And now that, the issue is that there have been--there's been, you know, thirty years of funding, equal funding, and people feel as though they can't see the results. They feel as though much of the money went to administrative fees and it did not go into the classroom, so the Newark Public Schools actually were taken over. There were a number of school systems in New Jersey that were taken over by the, by the state, and you still don't see a lot of changes, but Newark [New Jersey] in particular has been under state rule for about over twenty years. And people say, "Well, what's really the difference? Now you have--per student, look at the amount that you're spending. You said it was money. We've done the money thing, and now we still don't seem to see the results," which is so unfortunate because we do know that money does help, but you also need the right leadership as well. Newark has been very, very challenged by all of that, and I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that without a middle class, and without, you know, the parents of middle class students advocating, it sort of really changes the whole dimension. It changes the whole dynamics--
Speaker 1: It helps.
Speaker 2: --of all of that.	But, no, the Florio administration was an interesting administration in New Jersey, and the tax increase was phenomenal. So Bill Bradley is running for the Senate at the same time, and they were all (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In what year? I'm sorry, what--
Speaker 2: I think it was, I think it was 19--I think it's '94 [1994] now. I think it's 1994 (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now 1994, you go with the CIT Group [CIT Financial Corporation; CIT Group, Inc.]. It's the same time.
Speaker 2: Oh, I forget. Do I go there then? Okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: But, anyway, New Jersey went through a tumultuous period, and that was around the time that Christie Whitman [Christine Todd Whitman], Governor Whitman, ran against Bill Bradley for the U.S. Senate. Because of Bill Bradley's, you know--because it was such a close election because of the anti-Florio piece, it wasn't a vote against Bradley, it was a vote against Jim Florio. Governor Whitman then becomes very well known. I mean, it's just a phenomenal sort of sea change in New Jersey because Democrats outnumber Republicans like two to one, so it's--to get a Republican governor, you have to have one that is more like a Rockefeller governor, just socially--in terms of social policy, very liberal but fiscally conservative. So Bill Bradley almost lost the Senate at that point, which was really scary for New Jersey because he was like a phenomenal representative for us. He was really, really great.
Story_ID: 667166
Speaker 1: But, anyway, so I am head of the rate counsel [New Jersey Department of the Public Advocate Division of Rate Counsel]. Jim Florio [James Florio] leaves office. At that point, it's--I forget the exact year, but I--let's see. What do I do? What happens? I'm rate counsel, and then I take off, really my first sabbatical after having my children. I took a four week maternity leave with my son [Phillip Wells] when I was at New Jersey Bell [New Jersey Bell Telephone Company; Verizon New Jersey, Inc.], and a five week maternity leave with my daughter [Teresa Wells] when I was at the city. So here I am. I have a seventh grader and a ninth grader, and I take a sabbatical, and what happens is, I joined--I had been on a lot of nonprofit boards, but they come out of the woodwork, and they hear--, "Oh, my god. I hear you're taking a break." I had to screen boards like you wouldn't believe. I ended up going on about ten boards. But I had one requirement, I would not do evening meetings. I said, "No, my--this is about my children. During the day when they're in school, I'll go to a board meeting, but no night meetings." I think one exception was Planned Parenthood [Planned Parenthood Federation of America]. I said okay 'cause they were doing a lot of pregnancy prevention programs that I thought were important for teenagers, so I said that's my only night meeting, so I went on all these boards, but I had been on a lot of boards before.
Speaker 2: So can we--
Speaker 1: So--yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) talk about those? Like--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So when we were last talking, you started at United Way [United Way of Essex and West Hudson, Newark, New Jersey], and that was the--you know, because of Lowenstein [Alan V. Lowenstein].
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: You were saying. So what--who are you meeting on--what are the boards, and then who are you meeting?
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: Some of your significant boards.
Speaker 1: Yeah. That's really interesting. The United Way was interesting because I joined the allocations committee, so that's the committee that decides the amount of funding for the various organizations and nonprofits, so that is a very prestigious one to be on. Very early on I was on that one. And the United Way board was comprised of a lot of wonderful community leaders, lawyers, physicians, you know, business leaders, and presidents, so the exposure was really phenomenal from the very beginning. And I remember I had a couple of grassroots organizations, and I also had the Boys and Girls Clubs [Boys and Girls Club of Newark, Newark, New Jersey]. And the Boys and Girls Clubs was run by a very, very famous philanthropist, Ray Chambers, and he's still very, very active and very involved in Newark [New Jersey]. In fact, one of his mentees is also my mentee [Shavar Jeffries] who just ran for the mayor of Newark, so the intersection of your lives at different points is just phenomenal. But once I joined, the Newark Day Center [Newark, New Jersey] was the other one that I joined because Lowenstein Sandler [Lowenstein, Sandler, Brochin, Kohl, Fisher and Boylan; Lowenstein Sandler LLP] asked us to, asked both Ted [Wells' husband, HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.] and, and me to both go on that board, and they had a senior citizen, you know, facility. They had a daycare center. They had a--and the Fresh Air Fund, so they had the summer camp program, and we really gravitated toward that and actually, you know, were involved in fundraisers for the Fresh Air Fund, as well as for--in fact, all of the lawyers in New Jersey get together for a--what they call the Battle of the Barristers, and it's like a round robin with like fifteen law firms competing, and they raise, I don't know, at this point, quarter of a million dollars for the Fresh Air Fund, so Ted and I got involved in the Fresh Air Fund. And then little by little, we got involved with the Newark Museum [Newark, New Jersey]. I went on boards of local colleges, College of Saint Elizabeth [Morristown, New Jersey]. Let's see, Teach for America, hospital board--Saint Barnabas [Saint Barnabas Medical Center, Livingston, New Jersey]. But one of the big things we did, and the big fundraisers were always United Negro College Fund [UNCF], and that was under the auspices of the Garden State Bar [Garden State Bar Association], and the Association of Black Women Lawyers [Association of Black Women Lawyers of New Jersey], and we would host an annual fundraiser at our home. Each home, we had--and the houses got bigger just to accommodate that.
Story_ID: 667167
Speaker 1: Then one of the other things that happened was local government officials, primarily--we were very selective, primarily senators and members of [U.S.] Congress, although we did do some more local fundraisers. Bill Bradley, we became very close to Bill Bradley and did a lot--hosted a lot of events for him, and then--but with the United Negro College Fund [UNCF], it was amazing the people that would come to that. I'm speaking of public officials. We would have senators and members of Congress attend those fundraisers as well. I can remember Senator Frank Lautenberg coming to those, Senator Bill Bradley, Congressman Donald Payne [Donald M. Payne], but Ted [Wells' husband, HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.] was very active in Donald Payne's campaign from the very beginning. He ran two times unsuccessfully against Congressman Peter Rodino [Peter W. Rodino], and then he was successful. In fact, now, as you know, his son [Donald Payne, Jr.] is now in Congress and has his father's seat. He was on the city council [Newark City Council] for a while. But United Negro College Fund, we would host an event at the our home for about fifteen years, and under the auspices of Garden State Bar [Garden State Bar Association], Association of Black Women Lawyers [Association of Black Women Lawyers of New Jersey], and then we had--it got so big, we had to move it to the performing arts center in Newark [New Jersey], but there were many, many, many--I'm just trying to think of some of the other--the New Jersey Performing Arts Center. We've both been on their board. Most of the major organizations in Newark, at one point, we've been involved in, whether it was Urban League [Urban League of Essex County, Newark, New Jersey], NAACP [Newark Branch NAACP, Newark, New Jersey], and many other schools. I always was very active with my children's schools, and we'd host fundraisers; Montclair Kimberley Academy [Montclair, New Jersey], Seton Hall Prep [Seton Hall Preparatory School, West Orange, New Jersey], which has a scholarship mentoring program, and we've given--hosted a fundraiser for them every year. In fact, their first recipient of that program is a young man named Shavar Jeffries who just ran for mayor of Newark. And to show you how things come full circle, Shavar Jeffries lost by two thousand votes and is now a partner at Lowenstein Sandler [Lowenstein Sandler LLP] where Ted first started his career, so you just never know. The next generation is now coming up sort of assuming these wonderful positions and will likewise contribute. I also am on the board of an organization in Newark called iReform [iReform, Inc.], which was actually started by Shavar Jeffries to help parents navigate through the public schools in Newark [Newark Public Schools], and to really advocate on behalf of their children. He has a wonderful organization. But--and now I'm involved in organizations here into New York [New York]. I'm on the board of the New York Center for Arts Education, which is responsible for making sure that every student in the public schools in Newark has arts education--in New York (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In Newark--New York.
Speaker 1: In New York.
Speaker 2: In New York.
Speaker 1: And one of the young, the young man that runs that, Eric Pryor [Eric G. Pryor], was my museum director when I was secretary of state. I had my own museum (laughter). A wonderful museum, the New Jersey State Museum [Trenton, New Jersey] with a collection of 2 million pieces, really a phenomenal, phenomenal place.
Story_ID: 667168
Speaker 1: I've had a great career in law, and then transitioned from law in a non-legal position at Schering Plough pharmaceuticals [Schering Plough Corporation], so after I had my sabbatical, I did go (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, now--
Speaker 1: Oh, CIT Group [CIT Financial Corporation; CIT Group, Inc.]. We forgot the CIT Group. We didn't get to that yet.
Speaker 2: Right. No, that's why I want to--but the--did you take the sabbatical before the CIT Group or after (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Before the CIT Group.
Speaker 2: That's what I thought. Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah. You're right. You're right. You're right.
Speaker 2: And, and the--
Speaker 1: Before the CIT Group.
Speaker 2: --and the sabbatical lasted how long?
Speaker 1: Two years.
Speaker 2: Two--
Speaker 1: I took--
Speaker 2: --two years.
Speaker 1: I say that two years I went on about ten boards. I went on so many boards.
Speaker 2: Now, what made you decide to do that?
Speaker 1: You know, I tell you--
Speaker 2: Was it because you were burnt out a little bit from that seven day (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I--oh, no. I took the sabbatical strictly for my children.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I really--I came home one day, and, you know, the book bags were all over the floor, and I said, you know what. I think we need a new sheriff in town. I really felt as though my children--my son [Phillip Wells] more than my daughter [Teresa Wells]. My daughter was in ninth grade and very, very focused. My son, seventh grade, and he was at a private school, Montclair Kimberley Academy [Montclair Kimberley Academy Middle School, Montclair, New Jersey]. He was doing well, but not as well as I thought he could do. And he--I felt as though they needed more guidance and needed me to be there more often. I had just had a job where it was seven days a week, and late into the night I was on the phone at ten o'clock at night getting ready for a pretrial conference with my team on the utility cases, and I just felt as though my children needed more attention and for me to focus a little bit. At that point, I think Ted [Wells' husband, HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.] had probably been in ten hotels trying cases all over the country, and I just felt like, you know what. We need some real TLC at home. And we'd just bought a new house in Livingston [New Jersey], and I remember trying to move everything. I was moving alone. Ted was off on a case, and the kids were away for the summer, a summer program. They'd always do these summer academic programs. And I said, this is, this is--I'm overwhelmed. Just moving made me just realize just how out of control everything was, and I said, I need a break. And I said and the children need that TLC. So it was a great two years. I joined lots of boards, as I said, continued doing lots of wonderful fundraisers for all the various organizations as I still do today. One of the reasons I haven't sold my New Jersey house 'cause everybody still wants me to give these fundraisers and parties for these organizations, which I'm happy to do. And now it's like a joke in New Jersey. When I meet someone, "I've been to your house." Well, that's a joke 'cause everybody has been to my house (laughter). I mean, you come with a check, you can come for whatever organization, and there always is another one like, you know, you--I can name a few. But, anyway, so I spent two years really spending more time focusing more on, you know, the children, and driving them to their activities rather than having them, you know, taken. And I do remember my son at one point. He said to me, "Mom, if we have another Donna Reed dinner, I'll die." He goes--'cause when you're not here, they can always, you know, call the pizza place or whatever.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: So he said, "Oh, another dinner. Don't you have a meeting or something?" Can we get rid of you? This is a little bit too intense, right. I mean, I didn't miss a sporting event. I was--after school, I was right there with the big crockpot and the soup, and he was like, don't I get any downtime to get on the phone and do all the stuff I usually do? It's like, no. I'm right here. And it was rough for them (laughter).
Story_ID: 667169
Speaker 1: But I was giving a wonderful event for Bill Bradley, and he had all the CEOs--it wasn't a fundraiser, it was a friend raiser, and they just wanted to thank people for a lot of the support, and I met the CEO of CIT Group [CIT Financial Corporation; CIT Group, Inc.] at that point, Al Gamper [Albert R. Gamper, Jr.].
Speaker 2: Now was that, that was after his, his president run or before. Was that--
Speaker 1: That was right around the time that he was, yeah--
Speaker 2: Think- running for (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) thinking of it, right, right, exactly. That is really, really, right, yeah, around the time. But, anyway, I did meet Al Gamper, and--
Speaker 2: And you really--do you know why he did not come off--I mean, he was not as pop- maybe he was too East Coast some people said even though he was this basketball star--
Speaker 1: I know.
Speaker 2: --and this--
Speaker 1: I think it had to do with--I don't know, he's very, very, very--I think, intellectually very engaging, but, you know, for some people, it's got to be the sound bite. It's got to be this super charismatic person that's--I mean, I think he was very charismatic, but I think they want the message distilled in a way that everybody is not willing to distill it. Sometimes you just want to talk about the issues and tax reform, and I don't think he, he just didn't catch on.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I think the way that people had really hoped that he would.
Speaker 2: And Ted [Wells' husband, HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.] was upset about it, you know, Ted--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah. My children [Teresa Wells and Phillip Wells] both worked for him. Everybody was very, very upset. I think he would have been a wonderful, wonderful president, a wonderful leader, but he's gone onto do very interesting things.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know, anyway, but he ended up serving, I think, four terms [sic. three] in the U.S. Senate. I think four terms and accomplished an awful lot. But, anyway, we're having a party, and the president, CEO of CIT, said, "What are you doing now?" I said, "Oh, I'm a lawyer, but I'm on a break." He goes, "What type of law?" And I told him. He goes, "Oh, my company needs a lawyer like you. Why don't you come in and interview?"
Speaker 2: So can you talk--what is the CIT Group?
Speaker 1: Financial services company, and they're still working with primarily finance, aircraft, and--but just generally financial services, but really large, you know, things like that, primary--
Speaker 2: Like thirty- I read thirty-five billion [dollars] in leasing and assets.
Speaker 1: That's sounds about right. That sounds about right, yeah. And they were based right in Livingston [New Jersey], right near my home, and I went over and interviewed and met everyone, and they said, "Oh, we think you're a perfect fit." And I went in and I did contracts again, some employment law, debt offerings, and sort of a real mixture of general corporate, but I had--I had so much experience. It's like me. I go into a legal department in a corporation (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, how, how large was the department?
Speaker 1: The department was only about twenty-five people, and I was in the general corporate group, and you know what I liked about it, everybody in the general corporate group, and there were only four of, four of them, five with me, everybody had a family, and so it was very family friendly. So I finally told my children--I had to sort of, you know, look around and say, okay, where is this going to be compatible with my lifestyle? And it was one traffic light from my house. I loved the CEO. He--they used to have a executive dining room. When he came aboard, he--no more executive dining room. They used the dining room to tutor kids. Kids would come in, buses from all over, Newark [New Jersey] and other places, and all the execs [executive], including him, people would go down and tutor, and you'd have a student for a semester. It was great. And just--he was very philanthropic, and he also was on the board of Saint Barnabas hospital [Saint Barnabas Medical Center, Livingston, New Jersey], and, you know, ended up introducing me and getting me on that board as well, and that was my local hospital, so that was fine with me. That was a very, very good fit. In fact, I'm still on their board. I got off when I became secretary of state, and now I'm back on again. But the practice was great because it was so family friendly as well. You came in around 8:00 or 8:30, and by 6:00, 6:30, you were home. I mean, you were leaving. And if you had work, you would take work home with you, but that was a nice way to sort of transition back into law without being, you know, at work until ten o'clock at night. So loved that, and it was--I was there for about, I don't know, I forget the exact number of years.
Story_ID: 667170
Speaker 1: And then an opportunity presented itself to run the Rutgers' Minority Student Program [at Rutgers Law School, Newark, New Jersey], which, as you can imagine, was just a phenomenal opportunity, and I got a phone call, kind of interesting, got a phone call, asked me if I was interested. And I told the dean, I said, "I wanna come over and meet you." So it was just going to be a, you know, quick meet and greet, and then I was just going to decide whether I even wanted to pursue it, and he actually had a group of people there ready to interview me, which I was a little surprised about, and then they made me an offer right away, and it was like one of those offers you can't refuse. But, then again, it turned out not to be as compatible with--my daughter [Teresa Wells] went off to college, and then my son [Phillip Wells]--Ted [Wells' husband, HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.] did like three cases out of town that year, and then there was my son, and I said, you know what, I love being there. Right now, I walk around New Jersey, and people are still saying, "Dean Wells [HistoryMaker Nina M. Wells], Dean Wells, Dean Wells," and one year, the number of students that I mentored--I wasn't just doing admissions. I was also doing career, you know, counseling. I wasn't supposed to be, but people knew me and knew I had been a practicing lawyer for many, many, years, and just wanted to--and you--I'm sure you get that all the time. They just want you to talk to them about their life and their career and everything, so--
Speaker 2: So, so now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) it was challenging.
Speaker 2: So Nina, what was--talk, talk about the program a little bit and how many directors had there been before you, and--
Speaker 1: Only one.
Speaker 2: And that was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Janice Robinson, and I don't know if you know her. She's now at Columbia University [Teachers College, Columbia University, New York, New York]. She had been the only one, and this was something very, you know, personal for her, so she wanted someone to take it over that she felt would really do a really good job because, basically, one third of the class is admitted through the Minority Student Program, and the director actually reads, you know, a thousand applications to arrive at the one third of the class which was probably, you know, thirty students, and, like I said, it's the most aggressive minority student program where the emphasis is not on LSATs. Although LSATs do matter, your college record matters, you know, a lot, and there're other, other criteria, like, you know, the other things you've done in your life, whether they be internships, community programs, community involvement, and your, your family background and what you've had to overcome to arrive, you know, at that point in your life. So you really look at the whole person and, you know, who is really going to be successful as an attorney and make a substantial contribution beyond law school. So you do that, but there's also an academic component to the program where you ensure that all of the students who come into the program do well academically, so a lot of academic support services which you are responsible for. The issue is that there's a night school--there's a day program, a night program, and a summer program, so and they--my problem with the program was that they, the person that had done it before had basically moved into the school and was doing it like full time. I mean, like but you--she was running around the clock. I don't think she ever went home. I think there was a cot in the office. So here I come in, right out of corporate law with these two kids and a son who's still in high school, and the demands of it. I mean, when I started seeing ten o'clock at night, I'm calling my son saying, "I'm on my way," and it was like, this is not, this is not good, right?
Story_ID: 667171
Speaker 1: So I think it was a good lesson that you really need to do your due diligence to be certain that you have the right job at the right time in your life because I could not have been secretary of state when my children [Teresa Wells and Phillip Wells] were--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --growing up. It was only a job that I could have taken when I was totally free, seven days a week from morning until night. And I do mean from seven- 6:30 in the morning, I'd leave my house at 6:30 and get back at ten, eleven, twelve, seven days a week, you know, so you have to know, you know, what's, you know, really compatible with your lifestyle, and what's really going to work with your priorities. 'Cause for me my children were like the top priority. I mean, early on, I think I realized the children come first. I mean, yes, my career is important, but, you know, you really have to make sure, yeah, that you're doing it well (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But, but you're--and that balance.
Speaker 1: And the balance.
Speaker 2: You know, the, the balance.
Speaker 1: And the balance, and I needed the balance, and, and early on, when I was in the corporation counsel's office [in Newark, New Jersey], there was a wonderful judge, Judge Betty Lester, and she was just--she ended up becoming presiding judge. And I remember appearing before her one day, and she was tough on me, whoa. She was really--I forget the case, and she was like ripping away, and I thought, oh, my god, what kind of life does she have? What's her problem? That day, I saw her with this beautiful little girl, and I said, "Oh, Judge Lester, is that your daughter?" She goes, "Oh, yeah, meet my daughter." And then I saw her later on or the next day, and I said, "Wow, how do you do this? How do you--," I mean, 'cause she was like--, "you're this tough judge, and now you got this little girl, and you're all like, you know, really wonderful." She said, "You know, my life is really fortunate." She said, "When I'm at work, I'm totally focused. I love being a judge. I love being a lawyer." She said, "When I walk in that door at night and see my daughter, I melt, and it's like the best combination that a person could ever have." And that made such an impression on me. I said, "Hm," I said, "you can really do both and really love doing both and juggle both?" So I never questioned my ability to really do both. Although, there were times when, you know, my kids had chicken pox, and I had to get out the door. I'm like, I got to go to work. There's one thing challenging I did have--but I love my husband to death, but one challenging thing was, I would say, "Oh, my god. One of the kids is sick." And he'd say, "I got a jury out. I got to be in court at nine o'clock. Love you. Good luck." What could he do? There's nothing he could do. He was out the door. That's when I was in tears. What am I going to do? You know, the housekeeper that showed up late or no babysitter or the babysitter was sick or it was at a point where you didn't have a babysitter anymore. It was like, oh, what am I going to do? Like, you know what, you--those were so far and few, you, you figured it out. You figured it out some kind of a way. But I have to tell you, back in those days with the phone company [New Jersey Bell Telephone Company; Verizon New Jersey, Inc.] being kind of an all-male place, you didn't talk about your kids a lot. You had pic- one picture of them, and if you had to leave, you weren't making an announcement about it. Okay. The keys were on the--you grabbed the keys. You put the jacket on the back of the chair. It was freezing. You'd run to your car, got a kid who had just thrown up in school, you mopped up there and you put them in the backseat and rushed home and dropped them off and raced back to the office. It was like, did they know I was gone? Did anybody, anybody know I was gone? Any calls (laughter)? You did have a lot of stress around figuring out, how am I going to juggle this so nobody knows, nobody knows I'm missing, right? 'Cause back then, you didn't--you couldn't BlackBerry. If your boss was looking for you, they'd call from upstairs, and secretary would call, you know, "He'd like to see you, please. Are you available?" Yes, you better be available. And you run up the--run--jump on the elevator and you run up with your pad, and so it was very, very challenging, but early on, my husband was like, "You know what? They're not God." He would call the office, and they'd say, "Oh, she's in with Mr. So and So, her boss." He'd say, "Well, I'd like to talk to her." They would say, "Oh, you can't interrupt." He'd say, "Why can't I interrupt? I'd like to talk to her, please" (laughter). He was so irreverent about all of that from the very beginning. He said, "What's the president's name?" And I'd say. He says, "Well, I hope you're calling him by his first name." I'm like, "Really?" Called everybody by their--I mean, here I was a junior lawyer, the president, CEO. "Don't they have a first name? Use it." He was so funny. Ted [HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.] was politically smart, and I think that's what happens to a lot of young people. You come into that environment and you're intimidated, and he was like so comfortable with it, and the politics he understood and I didn't. I never understood the politics and never quite understood why. If I'm the first one there, and the last one out, and I'm working like a dog, why isn't that going to be enough? So I learned a lot (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We're going to change.
Speaker 1: --of lessons around that (laughter).
Story_ID: 667172
Speaker 1: Now, how does Schering- Schering Plough [Schering Plough Corporation] come--is it Plough (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, Schering Plough, yeah.
Speaker 1: How does it come into play?
Speaker 2: Yeah. I then meet the general counsel of Schering Plough, and I said to him--he says--I said, "You know, I'm interested in practicing law again," but I went in and met with some of the lawyers, and then they said--I forget exactly who said it. Maybe it was the general counsel. He said, "Nina [HistoryMaker Nina M. Wells], have you ever considered a career in public affairs?" He said, "You have such an interesting background." he said, "because we're looking for someone to be the vice president in public affairs." I said, "That sounds interesting." He said, "Yeah, you have the public political campaign budget, and you have money for philanthropic programs, and you're the interface between everybody in Washington [D.C.] and Trenton [New Jersey] for our senior management team." I thought this is like a fabulous job, and during my tenure, the president of the foundation [Schering Plough Foundation] retired, and they said, "Hey, c'mon, president of the foundation," so it was a wonderful blending of both the political and the philanthropic. And so what I did was, I got very, very lucky because there were a number of programs that Schering Plough was doing, and one was working with school nurses to have them assist in enrolling families in the affordable--it was similar to Obamacare [Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010], but we had the, the federal CHIP program, children's health program [Children's Health Insurance Program]. And there were so many uninsured children in New Jersey, and we were focused in certain areas in Union County [New Jersey]; Elizabeth [New Jersey], one of the poorer areas of New Jersey, and I ended up doing these programs where we were enrolling thousands and thousands. Christie Whitman [Christine Todd Whitman] was the president at the time.
Speaker 1: Who was president?
Speaker 2: I mean, not president, was the governor. Christie Whitman was, was the governor, and she announced that we would lose some of this CHIP funding if we didn't get people enrolled, so I was very friendly with the president of Schering Labs [Schering Laboratories], Rich Zahn [Richard W. Zahn], and Rich said, "Nina, I'm transitioning my salespeople with new computers. Can you use computers? I have thousands of them." I'm like, are you kidding me? Thousands of computers. And I would do these public programs and ask legislators who were interested in healthcare to be part of these programs, and we went around the state giving away wonderful computers that were (unclear). They looked brand new--to school nurses, and they would then go into their schools, ascertain who was uninsured and sign kids up. Then we hired some community leaders, who, basically, we'd pay for a Xerox machine on the street, they would be out on the street enrolling families in FamilyCare, NJ FamilyCare [New Jersey FamilyCare], which was the CHIP federal program.
Story_ID: 667173
Speaker 1: So Schering Plough [Schering Plough Corporation] was a platform to do so much in the public arena in Elizabeth [New Jersey], in Union County [New Jersey], for pediatric obesity, all kinds of public health programs, insuring families. And I thought, how interesting is this? That's how I really got to know Bill Bradley. There was a clinic, community health center in Elizabethport, which was is the poorest section of Elizabeth, and they were being managed and run by Rutgers School of Nursing. We found out that the nurses were going in their pockets paying for prescriptions, kids that--people would bring the kids in. They couldn't afford the prescription, and the nurses were paying for it, so we set up a fifty thousand dollar line for them to have just for prescriptions. Then we found out that they were really, really having financial problems, so there was another (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You mean the nurses, or--
Speaker 1: No, no, the, the community health centers.
Speaker 2: The centers, okay.
Speaker 1: It was called Elizabethport Community Health Center [Elizabeth, New Jersey], so we knew that there was another health center which was federally qualified in Plainfield [Plainfield Health Center, Plainfield, New Jersey] run by a fabulous African American woman who's now at Rutgers Law--or Rutgers undergraduate [Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey], Julane Miller-Armbrister, so I said to her, "Would you be willing--," and we had a whole committee around trying to partner this small clinic, community health center with this larger one which was federally qualified. I happened to call Bill Bradley's office. I read in the paper that he wanted to see federal, more federal support of community health clinics and health centers. You know, I called his office, spoke to one of his staff members who was in charge of outreach, and she did some work with healthcare, but really one of his just really Cracker Jack staff people, and I said, "I read in the paper about the senator," and I said, "you know, I don't really know him well, but I'd love for him to get involved and help us get some federal money." Do you know she called me back two days later, and she said, "Okay, what--which facilities?" I told her Elizabeth and Plainfield. She says, "Let me do some research." And she said, "What do you want the senator to do?" I said, "Get us some federal funding." She called me back, and she said, "He wants to come over for a tour." I said, "We'll have some of the Schering executives there. We want to have some media. We want to expose the fact that he wants to do this." And she said, "Great." He--Corzine [Jon Corzine] came with one staff person, spent like three hours touring Plainfield, getting to know everybody. He goes, "What do you need?" We laid it out for him. Within a month, Plainfield had a million dollars. The Eport clinic had half a million. One and a half million dollars, and it took like one phone call. I was like, god, I like this guy (laughter). Corzine was great. He said--he's--and I got to know him, and then he said, "I'd like for you and Ted [Wells' husband, HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.] to join my finance committee. I've got a lot of candidates I'm promoting."
Story_ID: 667174
Speaker 1: Actually gave a fundraiser for [HistoryMaker] Ron Kirk, who, as you know, joined the Obama cabinet [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] when he was running for the [U.S.] Senate in Texas, gave a big fundraiser at my house (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, now how did, how did you end up--I mean, he's in Texas, so--
Speaker 1: He was in Texas, but, but at that time, Corzine [Jon Corzine] was head of the committee in the Senate that provided the funding for all the races nationally.
Speaker 2: Oh, I see.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's how you found out about Ron Kirk 'cause you--
Speaker 1: That's how I found out about Ron Kirk.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And they said, "What about a fundraiser at your house for Ron?" I said, "Great." Well, in fact, I just saw Ron. Ron was at the, the conference the other day, and I saw him, and I said, "Oh, my god. Remember that night we bonded?" It was interesting because that was the night--I was having the fundraiser, and we thought hundreds of people were coming. It was the night that Bob Torricelli [Robert Torricelli] decided to resign from his Senate seat, and the Democratic Party had three days to put a replacement on the ballot before it was the deadline cutoff, so everybody--all the political folks stayed in Trenton [New Jersey], so they could negotiate that and figure out, and Ron is like, "Nobody is coming to my fundraiser." I'm like, "Don't worry about it. I got it. Believe me, I always over invite." I had tons of people that wanted to meet him 'cause he was attorney general (mumbles). So we had a great fundraiser that night, so every time I see him, "Remember that night we bonded and we thought nobody was coming to your fundraiser?" So you never know who you're going to meet, and somebody like Corzine calling his office. And then actually--I got to know him even better because my daughter worked on his campaign. She had just come off of the John Kerry, John Edwards campaign for president where she thought she was going to the White House. They all did. 'Cause the exit polls showed that he had won, but we didn't know about--
Speaker 2: This is when (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) Ohio.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Let's talk about the years, 19--'02 [2002]--that's not, not--
Speaker 1: Let's see. That's going to be--is it--it's 1996 [sic. 2004].
Speaker 2: Right, it's probably around there.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay. So my daughter works on his campaign. She does a dance for months and months and months and she's going to Washington [D.C.] because she called--she was turning in her BlackBerry and everything, and she said, "I'm just going to call and tell them I'm getting on the plane." She called and they said, "C'mon up for the celebration, the exit polls. We won." Remember the terrible exit polling? But we didn't know Ohio. So she gets there. By the time she gets there, everything has turned around and Ohio doesn't come in the way they expect, and boom, he loses. So she's in tears. She's like, "I can't believe I was going to White House," right. So she comes back to New Jersey, and a day later, she faxes her resume over to the Corzine campaign. I said, "Well, there's a gubernatorial--." She faxes her resume over and they--right away, say, "Oh, T. Wells [Teresa Wells], we know about you. C'mon." And she joins Corzine's camp, gubernatorial, and does advance and travels the entire state with him, and that's really how I really get to know him is through Teresa. And he had this great thing called Corzine Connection, and we gave these big events, and he says, "Nina [HistoryMaker Nina M. Wells], why don't you do one at your house?" We did a great big one, and I got to know him through that and a number of other things.
Story_ID: 667175
Speaker 1: Then at some point, he said, "Your background is so interesting." He said, "If I win, you're coming to Trenton [New Jersey]. That's all there is to it." I'm like, what? Yeah, really. You know, people say that to you. Got elected. I get a phone call to come down for the battery of interviews, and I interview, and he's got a bunch of people on the transition team, and they're going through my resume, and they're like, "You could be, you know, commissioner of like five different departments." And I'm thinking at that point, hm, I don't know about a great big department with a zillion people. So little by little, he and I talked, and he goes--I said, "State [New Jersey Department of State] is a nice manageable, small department." And he says, "But I'm going to add to your portfolio. You take it and we'll add to it." I'm like, if I start out small, that's great. I wasn't interested in any appointment with ten thousand people at that point. You know, I'm in my mid to late fifties at that point. I'm like, this could be really, really huge. I'm not sure I want that, and a lot of stress, and, you know, you don't--well, I felt fairly comfortable because I knew a lot of legislators. The work I had done at Schering Plough [Schering Plough Corporation] was a great entree because, quite frankly, almost everybody on the judiciary committee, and that's the senate committee that reviews your candidacy, I knew everybody on that committee. I was so fortunate having done a lot of work with Schering Plough pharmaceutical, which was such a well respected company, and I worked directly with the general counsel on all these special projects, and, you know, controlling the political contributions budget, as well as the philanthropic budget, doing all these great initiatives and all these public health programs, it was just, you know, a job to die for, but then Schering Plough decided to offer a huge, the biggest ever early retirement program, the biggest ever because we were getting new leadership. My whole team of everybody that I had worked with from the, the chairman to all of the presidents of all the various entities, they were pretty much all leaving and a new regime was coming in. So at that point, I thought, hm, may not be a bad time to really transition, and then we were in the process of--we just bought this apartment. We were going to renovate it. We were going to maybe sell New Jersey, consolidate here, so I took the early retirement package (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Because what we didn't discuss is Ted's career.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: He moved to New York [New York].
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: He had moved to New York.
Speaker 1: That's right. He's going to move to New York in 2000, so now Ted's here. I'm a block away full time, and I'm still in Jersey, the house in Jersey. The kids [Teresa Wells and Phillip Wells] have both gone off to college, so I'm in a real transitional period. So when they offer this retirement package, you know, so many years to your age, so many years to your service, lifetime medical, the whole nine yards. I showed it to my accountant. He was like, "You're leaving." "Okay." He says, "That's a package you cannot refuse," and then with my senior team leaving at the same time, and I loved my senior team, and in between the foundation [Schering Plough Foundation] and just the whole public affairs piece, it was a phenomenal job. So I thought, I'll transition, come to New York full time, sell my house, and then right after that, Corzine [Jon Corzine] says, "Come to Trenton." And he was like, 'Well, what are you going to do with that great New York lifestyle?" I'm like, "We'll put it on hold." So I go to Trenton, and for the next four years, I then live in New Jersey by myself (laughter), 'cause Ted [HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.] is here in New York, right, but half the time, he's in a hotel. He's traveling around. So I go back to, to live in New Jersey. The kids are both gone off to college and everything, and I step into one of the most wonderful positions that you could ever imagine. And people said that to me. They said, "You will look back on this and say I met the most amazing people, and I did the most amazing things." And it was everything that I ever imagined it would be and more and much more. It really was--it was just something that you just never envision, and every day, something would change about it that would make it even more wonderful, and it was really like having your own little mini corporation because the scope of what you did in the secretary state's office was so huge, and then Corzine added to my portfolio, which he said he would do and, indeed, he did do.
Story_ID: 667176
Speaker 1: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --talk about what, what happened.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You became the--
Speaker 2: Yeah. I became the secretary of state for New Jersey, and previous governors had moved certain functions out of the department for a variety of reasons, and Governor Corzine wanted to put it back in. But one of the fun things I did was, I was part of the senior staff, which really meant that you met with the governor every single day at eight o'clock in the morning, and, basically, what you would do is you sat around with like ten people, and you talked about all the priorities for the administration, what we were going to do that day, what public events there were, how we were going to execute things, and, basically, you, you were like the pulse of state government every single day, you know. Were there key issues you'd heard about that the governor needed to be aware of? If he was, you know, considering certain actions, what was your reaction? How did you feel about things, and, you know, so you were sort of eyes and ears outside of your own cabinet position, so you got a chance to really see everything that was going on in the state government, and to--and, politically, and you were--you know, had the political, you know, you have to be attuned to what was happening politically, comment accordingly, and if you saw opportunities. One of the really fun, fun, fun things I did, and I have a picture to capture it, is Ted [Wells' husband, HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.] said to me, "While you're there, ask the governor--we got to give Judge Robert L. Carter [HistoryMaker Robert L. Carter], we got to get him a building, a school, a school, a building, something. Nina [HistoryMaker Nina M. Wells], you're on a mission. Let's go do it." So I talked to Jon Corzine, and he says, "I'm fascinated with Judge Carter's career." I said--twenty-four [U.S.] Supreme Court arguments, won twenty-three. You know, argued Brown versus Board of Education decisions [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954], you know, before Thurgood [Thurgood Marshall] did, and Thurgood is getting feedback, and then they go and they come, the whole nine yards. 'Simple Justice' ['Simple Justice: The History of Brown v. Board of Education and Black America's Struggle for Equality,' Richard Kluger], you know, right, taking the pages out of 'Simple Justice.' And Corzine said, "What a phenomenal idea. Let's see what we can do." And I talked to Cory [Cory Booker], and it's like, "Cory, give me a school." "Everything is just so school board, and it's so difficult." So I said, "We got to find a building. We got to find a building, got a find a building." The department of education [New Jersey Department of Education], we said, "That's the perfect building," in Trenton [New Jersey], right. So I have this wonderful--we had a reception for Judge Carter here. Of course, we had a wonderful--at the department of education, we had the entire department, all of these great, you know, key people in state government, and governors come out and dedicate the department of education building [Robert L. Carter Building] to Judge Robert L. Carter. I'll show you the signage that is in front of it. And that morning, we were all set for the media and everything. That morning Judge Carter's wonderful son called and said Judge Carter was too sick to even get in the car. You know, he had coronary heart disease. I mean, this was maybe five years before he passed. He was very sick. And he said, "But we're coming," he and his brother [John Carter and David Carter]. He said, "We're coming and we'll speak and everything." And we're like, "No problem." So we have this wonderful, wonderful ceremony. Everybody in the department of education was going like really crazy. What's really nice, though, is that it's been memorialized in the lobby. First of all, there's a beautiful, huge sign which I'll show you. Then this--his, his bust, a plaque, the whole history of everything he did. They said busloads come to that building, it's like on the, you know, tour. If you come down to the statehouse in Trenton, that's one of the things that's a must see. Busloads of kids get out and read about Judge Robert L. Carter, which I think--who was a New Jerseyan, right?
Speaker 1: Now, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --talk about his relationship with New Jersey and his, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah. Started school in Newark [New Jersey], and his father [Robert L. Carter, Sr.] died. His mother [Annie Martin Carter] was a nurse, and she moved the family to East Orange [New Jersey], and he went to high school in East Orange. And, I mean, a lot of people from Newark and from--of course, he was a top, top, top student at Barringer High School [Barringer Academy of the Arts and Humanities] in Newark. A lot of people do not know, and in East Orange and graduated with honors, but he had a lot of challenges, though, because East Orange, at that time, was primarily Caucasian, and they didn't want him even to use the swimming pool, and he talks about how, you know, he dealt with all of the racism and everything and still graduated the tippy top of his class, and, you know, and then went Lincoln University [Lincoln University, Pennsylvania] and then on to Columbia Law School [New York, New York]. But a lot of people in Newark do not know him, so it's so nice now to have the department of education building in Trenton dedicated to him, and so it's exposed people in a way that they never would have been exposed, and then Raymond M. Brown, the son of the famous lawyer [Raymond A. Brown], although, he is also very famous, has a program called 'Due Process,' and they did a whole segment on Judge Carter right as he passed, so it's a wonderful piece, and they've replayed it over and over and over again, and I wish it could be part of something in your library.
Speaker 1: I, I actually saw, saw the piece (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Did you see the program?
Speaker 1: I saw the program.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Letting people in Newark know--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --in New Jersey.
Speaker 1: So let me--I mean, that was a wonderful thing to do. Did he, did he get to see the wall, though?
Speaker 2: He, he never got to see it. Although, we had pictures.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Because in his later years, he couldn't travel. Don't forget Trenton for him would have been two hours in the car, but his sons--you should see the pictures, amazing. We did a whole portfolio. But then we had a reception here at the apartment, and I, I brought it out so you could see it.
Story_ID: 667177
Speaker 1: So talk about what you were responsible for.
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You said that even duties got--you know, departments--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --or areas got handled.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So what--was there--how many African American female secretary of states--
Speaker 2: Well, there have been two others.
Speaker 1: Before you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, two others before me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Lonna Hooks and Regena Thomas. There have been two, two before. Now, what was so fabulous about being secretary of state was the governor took the department of elections--Division of Elections [New Jersey Department of State Division of Elections], out of the attorney general's office during my tenure and put it back in the secretary of state's office, which had--is where it had been for many years, and which is where it is for about forty states, and I ran President Obama's first election, and we had--we have 5 million registered voters in New Jersey. Typically, we get about 3 million for a presidential. We had 4 million, more than ever before in the history of the state. Now, I can't take credit for that. I always say, "Look what I did." The excitement over President Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] was incredible. Actually, the elections are really handled by our county--twenty-one county offices, but they all report to me, so we went out and really rallied, rallied, rallied the troops, but more importantly, there was this big initiative on the part of the public advocate [New Jersey Department of the Public Advocate] that basically required the department of motor vehicles [New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission] to register you. When you go to get your license, you're supposed to be given an application to register to vote. Well, apparently, that hadn't been done in all cases, so they brought a big action, and we had to write to every voter in the State of New Jersey and say to them, if you're not registered, and if you've been to a motor vehicle office, notify us. Well, we registered about a half a million people, but the challenge was if people come to the polls, and their name is not in the polling book, then you have a problem because they have to vote provisionally, and what that means is, you do it by paper. You, you don't go in the, you know, the actual booth and turn the lever. For a lot of people, that is very, very upsetting when you say, "No, you can't go in the booth and, you know, and press the button. We'll give you a piece of paper." They don't believe it's going to be counted. They're--you know, they know that the county board of elections has to review it. It can be challenged, so the key was to get every single voter into all of the twenty-one county books within a very short period of time. So basically, I, you know, went to every county, got on the phone with everybody and just said, "This is a very historic, important election. We've got to get all these names in the books." Do you know that in Newark [New Jersey] for Essex County [New Jersey], they did a, they did a three, three daily shifts, eight hours, three times. Twenty- they did twenty-four hours. They had an entire team making sure that for this historic election nobody was going to be turned away because they weren't in the book. I mean, they literally kept the county courthouse and county offices open 24/7 just getting all that in there right up until like the day before. And then we had a big push for vote by mail. We didn't have--our governor, Governor Christie [Chris Christie] has vetoed early voting in this state, so we can--we cannot vote early, but we can vote by mail. He's vetoed it. Um-hm, I know. So very upset about it, but we can vote by mail. So I came in at a time where they were getting ready to change to a different configuration of electronic machines, so I got to play a lot of very, you know, be involved in a lot of interesting policy issues around voting, but more importantly, the election of President Obama. And I remembered Governor Corzine [Jon Corzine], he got to his polling place, and about 6:15 he calls me, and I'm on my way out to go vote, and he said, "There's a line." I'm like, "Yeah, I know. We knew there were going to be lines." And I said, "You have three machines at your polling place, right?" And he goes, "Yeah." I said--we know 'cause we checked those machines. Are you kidding me? I said, "That's okay if there's a line." I said, "All three machines are working." "How about emergency ballots?" I'm like, "We don't need emergency ballots. We're good." I said, "Relax, we're good." People stood in line. They didn't care. But you got (unclear) more people ever to vote in history. They were talking to their friends and neighbors, comparing things. What restaurants do you like? It was the most glorious day of elections in New Jersey. I mean, we, we set up a command center, and we had like the ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union], and the public advocate and all these groups. We had met with them over and over again, so rather than challenging everything and going crazy on Election Day, if you see something, you hear something, call us. We had five hundred assistant attorney generals. We said, "Okay, the minute we hear about something, we'll send an assistant attorney general." People were asking for IDs. You're not allowed to ask for IDs. "Nobody is breaking any laws, so you call us, and we'll send an assistant AG." It was phenomenal. The operation was really amazing. I'm like, I can't believe. I'm the secretary of state in charge of elections with President Obama being elected. It was unbelievable. And we were out all over the state, vote, vote, vote. We said come midday, bring a sandwich, bring a book. Midday? At six a.m. when the polls opened, we had tons of people out there. They were so anxious to vote.
Story_ID: 667178
Speaker 1: With an election like that, and the election [of HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] will go down in history as one of the most innovative, best organized elections that--
Speaker 2: Exactly (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) ever. But what is the relationship between you and the, the campaign at that point? Is there--
Speaker 2: None.
Speaker 1: None.
Speaker 2: None, none, none. No, there's a Chinese wall, and you're just very, very careful that in no way can you be in any way political, and so I was going to fundraisers for him until I was--until elections got moved over, so I could no longer make any political contributions to any, anyone whatsoever. I had to set up a separate checking account for Ted [Wells' husband, HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.] to be able to give contributions to, you know, whatever because it could not be joint because all we had were joint accounts before that, and I did create a Chinese wall between myself and the campaign. No conversation. And, and you heard about all the stuff that went on in the Republican--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --campaign recently with the Bridgegate. And Corzine [Jon Corzine] was really great. We had all the campaign people were off site. We were never allowed--I was never allowed to have any contact with them. They knew never to call my office and talk to any of my people. We were very, very, very good about that. I mean, you know, otherwise, we would have tainted the whole process.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know, yeah. 'Cause we had a whole slate in addition to the president, we had, you know, all these other, you know, officials on the, on the ballot as well, so I couldn't do--I couldn't attend any events. I didn't even attend the inauguration. I was just really, really, totally apolitical for that period of time, and now it remains. That--a lot of the--a lot of people didn't want it to come out of the attorney general's office back into the department of state [New Jersey Department of State] because some of my predecessors had been viewed as being too political, yeah, too political.
Story_ID: 667179
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So now who had you succeeded? Who was in the position?
Speaker 2: Regena Thomas.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So she was African--
Speaker 2: She was before me, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She, she preceded me, and she was really instrumental in the federal Get Out the Vote. She was amazing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In terms of that, but she was--that was McGreevey [Jim McGreevey]. McGreevey had appointed her.
Speaker 1: Right. McGreevey, though, there--okay. (Laughter) Sorry.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: The controversy with--we've got--we need to change.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay. 'Cause it's so crazy (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: You know, you've been in some interesting--
Speaker 2: Oh, tell me about it.
Speaker 1: --politics. Like I was thinking personal politics, you know, like we didn't have in Chicago [Illinois]. I don't think we had in Chicago. You had like--news was coming out of, out of New Jersey like crazy.
Speaker 2: It was--oh, if I have to email my son [Phillip Wells] who came and got all those pictures for me. He says, "Mom, how are the pictures?" I forgot to, to tell him. But you are so right.
Speaker 1: I mean, it was just like--
Speaker 2: New Jersey.
Speaker 1: --funny (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) It was. Every time you turned around.
Speaker 1: No, crazy.
Speaker 2: You know, crazy, crazy.
Speaker 1: The only thing, Spitzer [Eliot Spitzer] took attention from you guys.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) (Unclear). But thanks for coming up.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: So talk about, you know, McGreevey because he had to resign--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in, I think, 2004, and--
Speaker 2: He was a good friend. He is a good friend.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I love him. He's a really great guy. And his wife [Dina Matos], as soon they became, got elected, he asked me over and over again, "Oh, help me, organize people for me," and we did. In fact, we had a huge, huge dinner meeting before the election with McGreevey and all of the African American ministers, and he was seeking their support. He goes, "Can you guys host?" He was always asking me to host everything. And the joke was, I'd have a party and McGreevey would show up. And one time he showed up, and I think it was for the EMILY's List, you know, the political organization.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I used to give so many events for EMILY's List. And he's at the front door. I said, "What the heck are you doing here?" I said, "Didn't you hear it was all women?" He said, "I don't mind that." I said, "You're not invited to this." We used to tease him all the time because no matter what event I had, he would find out about it, and he would appear (laughter). One, one night, I says, "This is all women." He goes, "Oh, I didn't know that. That's okay." But a very, very good guy, but, as you know, just so conflicted in so many ways. But the minute he was elected, his wife asked me to join the Drumthwacket Foundation [Princeton, New Jersey]. That's, that's the governor's mansion, and you raise money really for them to do all of the modifications, improvements, and they host wonderful events there, non--for nonprofits, as well as social events, so the Drumthwacket board is a great board to be on, and you meet a lot of people who are close to the governor, and I did that for her because she was, you know, getting her sea legs, once, you know, they were elected, and so I, I knew, I knew him long before I knew her. I mean, I watched them date for years, and remember when their daughter [Jacqueline McGreevey] was born, and he's very close to his daughter. You know, he's now living with his partner in New Jersey. His partner is an investment banker, and we have a lot of mutual friends, so we see him out socially from time to time. I was just at a big anniversary party, and he was there, so we always catch up, but he was a very interesting politician. When he was campaigning, he was a hoot. He was so funny. You'd see him all--literally all over the place. So we were kind of surprised when everything, you know, went the way that it did. It was--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --disappointing.
Speaker 1: Because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --he had employed his, his part--lover [Golan Cipel].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, right, his--
Speaker 2: Yeah, to be the home--head of homeland security.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And he wasn't even a U.S. citizen.
Speaker 1: Well, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah. He was a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And people were--
Speaker 2: --citizen of Israel.
Speaker 1: --they were concerned. I mean, people didn't know he was hom- you know, he was married (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) People knew. People know.
Speaker 1: They do?
Speaker 2: People knew.
Speaker 1: They did know, okay.
Speaker 2: We won't do that on tape. But people knew (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, sorry, sorry.
Speaker 2: That's okay, no, no. But people did know (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And he'll tell you too. He's such a great guy. He'll--he talks about all this stuff. Now he's doing stuff with ex-offenders. And then he was working out of Integrity House [Newark, New Jersey] dealing with ex-drug offenders, so I think he's doing a lot as a result of, you know, sort of realizing that he has a lot of skills, and how can he put it to good use, so, no, he's very active around New Jersey, you know.
Story_ID: 667180
Speaker 1: So talk about what else was in your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Uh-huh, okay.
Speaker 1: --portfolio.
Speaker 2: All right. So elections and then the governor [Jon Corzine] also added travel and tourism, which I was really--it was in commerce, and it's a forty- wait, at that point, it was like forty plus, $40 billion plus in expenditures spent in New Jersey on travel and tourism, and a lot of people don't think of New Jersey as travel and tourism, but it was a really good blending of the culture piece, because my cultural portfolio was basically we give away $40 million a year out of my department [New Jersey Department of State] to all of the arts organizations, history organizations. People don't realize that we have more historic sites per square foot than any state in the country. People don't realize we're the fifth largest producer of wine. I mean, who would know something like--I know. You're surprised. And then, of course, 127 miles of the most beautiful beaches in the country. Again, very surprising. You know, we have ski slopes. We have more golf courses than anyplace in the world. National Liberty [sic.], I think they're going to host like one of the biggest--what's the biggest golf tournament? The Masters [Masters Tournament]. Is it the Masters?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Masters.
Speaker 2: The Masters.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: We're going to host that at Liberty National, which is in Jersey City, New Jersey, more golf courses. So when people start to look at the, the state, they don't realize what beautiful skiing and--yeah, they think of New Jersey as, "Oh, there's a highway between New York and New Jersey, and there's a airport," and they don't really look at all the other things. So because I had the cultural portfolio, which meant I had a performing arts center [New Jersey Performing Arts Center, Newark, New Jersey]. Wait 'til you see my pictures with [HistoryMaker] Smokey Robinson. I mean (laughter). I--we had wonderful perform- Patriots Theater [Patriots Theater at the War Memorial, Trenton, New Jersey], eighteen hundred seats. We had the local symphony orchestra, beautiful. Even the Trenton [New Jersey]--Trenton, unfortunately, is one of those cities that's really struggling 'cause of so many problems, you know, with the middle class moving out of the cities and lack of business, and although they have city employees there every day which you think would sort of fuel the economy of the city, it really doesn't because of crime, and the employees use the cafeterias and they stay inside, which is unfortunate. But, anyway, the performing arts center that I ran, as well as the state museum [New Jersey State Museum, Trenton, New Jersey], and when I joined the administration, the museum was closed for renovations. The state had just put $15 million into renovating the structure of it, but there was no money for the new exhibits, so I had to raise personal--I mean philanthropic money. I had to go out and just fundraise, and I was really lucky 'cause I had great, great organizations that came in, you know, a half a million dollars from PSE&G [Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated], a half a million dollars from the Prudential Foundation [Newark, New Jersey], and a lot of that was just people that I had known and they knew that we'd do a really good job with the state museum. But $40 million every year to the cultural venues around the state, statewide, and that was just absolutely wonderful to shepherd all of that and meant so much for arts education, but you were really like the person that advocated for arts education, and, you know, in so many communities, students don't have that. And we did this big survey. Where are there, you know, pockets within the state where kids aren't getting that kind of exposure? So the arts piece was really, really huge. And then I also had the wonderful, wond- Office of Volunteerism [New Jersey Governor's Office of Volunteerism], trying to get as many citizens as you could to volunteer for everything imaginable. People forget what a role that plays. And then I had the various boards and commissions; the Martin Luther King Commission [New Jersey Martin Luther King, Jr. Commemorative Commission], the American Indian [New Jersey Commission on American Indian Affairs]--and that was phenomenal. People don't realize. We have seven tribes of American Indians [Native American] in New Jersey, and some of the, the issues that they were confronted with, the discrimination is still absolutely huge, and you wouldn't think that in New Jersey that you would really have that but you do. But, you know, Jersey was really ahead of the curve in terms of school integration, so you're surprised with all the discrimination because, actually, we had the test case that Thurgood Marshall came and viewed in Princeton, New Jersey. There was an African American man, and the, the New Jersey Constitution of 1947 did not--had a African American delegate, and he raised the issue of school discrimination. He said, "We should pass an amendment to desegregate all of our schools," and the experiment was Princeton, New Jersey, African American guy, and he got the vote. Two things, he said, "Let's integrate the militia in New Jersey and schools." Thurgood Marshall came to Princeton, New Jersey, to view and to understand how the integration was working out, and it was working out very, very well, and he took a lot of notes and used those notes and all of the information when he was litigating the Brown decisions [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954], so people don't realize that prior to Brown--in fact, it was six years--seven years prior to Brown we did that in New Jersey.
Story_ID: 667181
Speaker 1: But going back to the American Indians [Native American], so the American Indian commission [New Jersey Commission on American Indian Affairs], the American Israeli commission [New Jersey-Israel Commission]--what else did I do? Tell me what else I did (laughter).
Speaker 2: You did, you did Amistad Commission [New Jersey Amistad Commission].
Speaker 1: Oh, Amistad Commission, which was (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You did the Office of Faith Based--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --Initiatives [New Jersey Office of Faith Based Initiatives].
Speaker 1: That's wonderful, yeah.
Speaker 2: The War Memorial.
Speaker 1: Well, that's our Patriots--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Theater [Patriots Theater at the War Memorial, Trenton, New Jersey].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's our--then our museum [New Jersey State Museum, Trenton, New Jersey], state--
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: --museum, and then the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the Historical Commission [New Jersey Historical Commission].
Speaker 2: So the--and AmeriCorps.
Speaker 1: And Ameri- AmeriCorps was phenomenal. In fact, I was at a graduation at Drew University, which is a great private college in New Jersey, in Madison, New Jersey, which was actually run by Governor Kean [Thomas Kean] after he left the governor's office. And I was at--I was one of the honorees at graduation, and I remember him saying almost a third of the class of graduates was going with AmeriCorps and Teach for America. That is just huge, and then President Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] has really, really increased the number of positions for AmeriCorps, and the things that they do around the country, really phenomenal. So I had, you know, just probably the best of America all in that one department, whether it's arts education, culture, and volunteerism, and young people doing wonderful things in education and in public policy, and just the, the arts for New Jersey, economic engine, big time, the, the best cities and towns in New Jersey really do have at their core, the arts and history venues. So for us, it made such a difference in terms of infusing that economic piece, and for Newark [New Jersey]. Quite frankly, as I said before, I remember doing my testimony before the senate judiciary committee, I talked about how important the arts were for a city like Newark because I do believe without the performing arts center, I don't--you wouldn't have the number of tourists, you wouldn't have--people from the entire state converging on Newark for the wonderful performances. That's the home of our symphony orchestra [New Jersey Symphony Orchestra], and we have, you know, all the, you know, dance companies; Dance Theatre of Harlem, Alvin Ailey [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater]. They all come every single year, as well as--and we did a stint with Broadway. I'm on the board of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center [Newark, New Jersey], and the way in which it has transformed Newark has really been phenomenal.
Story_ID: 667182
Speaker 1: What did you learn in the position? You already knew New Jersey quite a lot.
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: So--but what did you learn that you didn't know?
Speaker 2: Yeah. You know, we have six hundred towns and, and municipalities in New Jersey, and every one of those towns is somewhat special and unique, but I didn't realize just how--I tell you, the, the real beauty of New Jersey and the assets of New Jersey, until you really travel around, you don't really get a sense of it and a sense of pride that people have in this state. People that live in New Jersey love New Jersey. And the thing that bothers me the most is that on the national level, people have no idea how phenomenal the state is. And you know what my concern is, without a TV station, we don't--we had a public television station that the governor defunded, that Governor Christie defunded. We had Public NJN [New Jersey Network], and I was on the board at one point of the Public Broadcasting Authority here in New Jersey [New Jersey Public Broadcasting Authority]. NJN, wonderful station, not enough resources to really, really make it competitive. I mean, we're in the Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], New York [New York] media market. You've got to be real competitive, so NJN did have recognizable stations in various, you know, communities; although, it was different in different places. Then when you have that, that's a problem 'cause people--you know, you're, you're down in southern Jersey. "Is it 23? Is it 28? Where the hell do I find this damn thing?" The governor defunded them. What they were trying to do is privatize, and they thought, let's get the licenses with a private entity. Let's see if we can raise a lot of money and raise our profile. What happened was, there wasn't enough conversation with the legislature [New Jersey Legislature] before that was proposed, so there was a lot of backlash at giving away important assets, and then when Chris Christie came into office, he decided to defund it. They were getting a lot of state funds. And to send it over to New York and have us collaborate with the New York station [WNET-TV, New York, New York], but we just don't seem to get--you don't get the exposure anymore. So New Jersey, as a result of not being able to really publicize what we're doing--although I had a pretty good budget for--and I did TV commercials, and we played them in certain parts of the country, it's very, very challenging without a really robust budget to really promote the state because all the things I'm telling you, you don't even know, you know, right? And most people don't know that about the state--
Story_ID: 667183
Speaker 1: What I learned was that, state deserves so much more exposure 'cause it is so beautiful. And that the balloon festivals [New Jersey Festival of Ballooning], you know, the hot air balloon festivals people don't even know about, and all of the jazz concerts. I mean, Camden [New Jersey] has a jazz concert--not Camden, Cape May [Exit Zero Jazz Festival, Cape May, New Jersey] that rivals anything you'd see in Rhode Island [Newport Jazz Festival], but we don't get the exposure, you know. All those--a lot of those events are well attended just by word of mouth and, you know, local publicity. So what I learned the most is that people in New Jersey love their communities. They love their communities; although, New Jersey tends to be more segregated than a lot of states. That's unfortunate.
Speaker 2: You mean racial, with the--
Speaker 1: Racially, but, let me tell you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Economically?
Speaker 1: Not exactly. Let me tell you another fact you don't know. We are the most diverse state by population in the country, and if you go to certain sections of New Jersey, oh, my gosh. East Asians, and, and let me tell you something. In Elizabeth [New Jersey], when I did my community work in Elizabeth, in the schools, they speak twenty-nine languages. Who would know that? Huge Russian population, French Haitian, so the div- although New Jersey is segregated, it's also very diverse. If you could ever kind of get those two things moving around, and the problem is the disparity in housing prices, you know. It's either very poor or very wealthy, and a fair middle class, but even the middle class, not a lot of diversity. Essex County [New Jersey] is the most diverse. You probably now Montclair [New Jersey], Maplewood. Montclair has more interracial couples than anyplace. Maplewood has more same sex couples with children than anyplace else in the country. So who knew that about New Jersey? That if you are, you know, a multiracial family, Montclair is so, you know, warm and receptive, or if you're a same sex couple with children, two mommies is no big deal. Two daddies, no big detail deal, Maplewood, New Jersey. So we just don't know that about this state. We don't have an opportunity to promote that because of the media issues.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: And, and funds.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know, we've just--we've been broke forever (laughter). New Jersey is broke all the time.
Speaker 2: Well, and then 2008, that also affect- that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, devastated us, devastated--and it, it hurts our philanthropy, too. Let me tell you why. Many people who live in New Jersey work in New York [New York], and they tend to give philanthropically in New York, so if you're with Goldman Sachs [Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.], or if you're with Morgan Stanley [Morgan Stanley Wealth Management], and you work in, in New York, and you live in New Jersey, you tend to give through--whether it's, you know, Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley, or JPMorgan [JPMorgan Chase and Co.] or whatever. You tend to give through your company in New York. 'Cause, you know, they hit you up for it in their tables or whatever, and then in New Jersey, not as--you're not as focused, unfortunately, so we get hurt there.
Story_ID: 667184
Speaker 1: This is really a job of a lifetime in many ways, especially--I mean, 'cause it's a fun job. These are--these are all fun things, and you--and then you have the election of the century.
Speaker 2: Motherhood and apple pie. I told my team every day we came to work, "Oh, my god, we love our job." I said to Ted [Wells' husband, HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.], "What do I do for an encore?" And guess what he said, "Nothing but ambassador, that's it" (laughter). So when Hillary [Hillary Rodham Clinton] gets in, I got to tell Hillary, I got to be an ambassador (laughter). But you know President Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] appointed me to the authority that runs the D.C. airports [Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority].
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: And that is, that's really quite interesting (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) can you talk about that because--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I mean, really, that was--I mean--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --it, it was a perfect job in many ways.
Speaker 2: Secretary of state was divine. I mean, you have no boss. Your boss is the governor who can only help you, and then anything you want, you would just say, "Governor, help me, I need this or that." You got it.
Speaker 1: And Cor- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know, it was just wonderful.
Speaker 1: --Cor, Corzine.
Speaker 2: Corzine.
Speaker 1: I keep wanting to say Corzine.
Speaker 2: I know.
Speaker 1: Okay, I don't know why.
Speaker 2: Corzine.
Speaker 1: But Corzine, I want to ask--what I thought was interesting about him is that he had been CEO of Goldman (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Goldman Sachs [Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.], that's right.
Speaker 1: And so he almost represented--we haven't talked about this because you--when you came into New Jersey, you came into a political structure where a lot of the politicians are more civil servants.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Then that--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And then this, we start seeing a different--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --type of politician so--
Speaker 2: That's right. Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --can you share that background and sort of talk about that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and how he was as a manager.
Speaker 2: Yeah. You know, I, I tell you, the good part was that he was financially, you know, very wealthy, and he was very, very generous to all of the political organizations. The way the political structure is in New Jersey with the various state committees really kind of deciding who's going to run, and that's where the power really is, he was so generous to all of those organizations so that they had the resources to really tap really good candidates to run for office. I mean, incredible. The bad news is, we're very much of an old school, old time political shop. You know, the, you know, the--you know, rubbing elbows and play golf with me, and you hang out with me, and you, you know, and, you know, it's, it's not necessarily the backroom kind of operations, but it's a level of familiarity that New Jersey politicians have gotten to be very comfortable with, and it's very culturally ingrained. Like for years after the legislators would meet, they would go over to this place, Angelo's in Trenton [Angelo's Pizzeria and Ristorante, Trenton, New Jersey], and everybody would eat and drink, and you'd share stories even though you'd screamed and bitched at each other, you'd, you know, smoke your cigars and hug and kiss, and go home. And then that sort of culture kind of changed as sort of the new politicians came in town, and the old school folks still wanted that, and they wanted that, you know, kiss my ring, and, you know, tell me I'm wonderful, even though, you have better credentials and more money, but we still want you to hobnob with us and, you know, back slapping and, and all of that. And for the newer politicians that came with a lot of expertise and different expectations of the political process, I think they found it challenging, very, very challenging. I mean, old politicians would run for office for years and years and years. That's kind of what they expected, and they feel like if you don't do that, they're not sure they can trust you, you know, kind of thing, even though New Jersey, in terms of corruption was just crazy. I mean, you used to have a meeting, and the joke was, you know, who, who patted each other down the most? Even if you had lunch, you were patting somebody down to see if they were wearing a wire. I mean, how crazy is that? So I would say, for somebody like Jon Corzine, who was super smart, integrity--and the same thing with Cory Booker. I think they were very similar; in that, they were both--they're both really bright, you know, very--they're, they're visionaries. They really want to get things done, and all that backroom, all that stuff, and the same for Cory as it was for Jon Corzine. People didn't connect in the way that we had hoped because, first of all, there's a level of suspicion when you're--you, you have come out of another, you know, sort of entity for, for Cory, it was like, "Oh, my god. The guy is like Oxford [University of Oxford, Oxford, England] and Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California] and Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut]. It's like, what does he really want?" And for Corz- Corzine, "Well, why is--what's, what's, what's this about? You know, he's got all this money. He's been the CEO, what's, what's his agenda?" So this level of really not trusting and not feeling as though you're necessarily one of us. One of us. What does that mean? And for Cory, I think, I think the [U.S.] Senate, the Senate was very comfortable for Jon, and it's very comfortable, I think for Cory. I saw him the other day. And there's certain places, I think, for certain political leaders, it has to be a good fit, and even though they are so well intended and wanting to accomplish so much, there are a lot of people that aren't going to support their agenda for their own reasons, you know.
Story_ID: 667185
Speaker 1: Where are you at this point in your life then?
Speaker 2: Well, I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because you said you were appointed by the--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: By President Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] to be a federal appointee. The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority has seventeen board members. Three are appointed by the president, six are appointed by the governor of Virginia, four by the governor of Maryland and four by the mayor of D.C. [Washington, D.C.]. Hope that ended up being seventeen. So I'm one of the federal appointees, and I did get a call from the Obama administration asking me to serve on the board, and I--the reason was, Congressman Donald Payne [Donald M. Payne] had called me a couple years ago before he, you know, passed away, and he said, "I have this great economic development committee I'd like you to serve on." He goes, "I'm sending your name to the White House." I'm like, "Oh, you're so wonderful to do that." So he passed, so what--the committee he was interested in, I never heard about that anymore, but then the White House Personnel Office called me and said, "The president would like to appoint you to a board, and we, you know, like to know whether you have any interests." And I said, "I have a lot of interests, you know, National Endowment for the Arts and this and that." And they go, "Well, we have one since you were a D.C.--originally a D.C. resident," and the three federal appointees do not have to live in the district, but if you have knowledge of D.C. I said, "Yeah. I grew up near National Airport [Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, Washington, D.C.]. My mom [Pearline Jackson Smith] is still there." And they said, "We'd like to--he'd like to appoint you." After all the vetting and everything, it was really intense vetting, really intense. I'm like what kind of clearance am I getting, top, top security? It was like unbelievable process. But I said, "Oh, anything for the president." So I've been on there for about two years, and we're also building--in addition to running Dulles International [Washington Dulles International Airport, Dulles, Virginia], we also are building the $6 billion extension of the Metro [Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority] to Dulles airport, so that's been like a huge, huge project. The first phase of it is done. Now we're working on the second phase, and I've joined a number of different committees. Being a lawyer, they've had a real need for legal expertise as well, which has been really fun. I'm on the risk management committee. That's been great. I'm on about five or six committees, and it's--I've learned an awful lot in the short period of time. But great group of board members, very, very exciting. In fact, I'm going to meet Secretary Foxx [Anthony Foxx] on Wednesday--on Tuesday, this coming Tuesday, and Secretary--oh, the outgoing secretary of transportation, LaHood [Ray LaHood]. He was wonderful. When he was, you know, in office and we, I--we went down and met with him on several occasions, and he was just phenomenal, talked a lot about the tunnel that we didn't get built between New Jersey and New York and how we need to get that built, so it was nice to bring some, you know, local concerns to the [U.S.] Department of Transportation, so it's been a wonderful experience. And now I'm on a number of other boards, so I've always done a lot of boards. So I'm doing a combination of things; trying to mentor a lot of people, and, like I said, my, my--one of my main mentees [Shavar Jeffries] just ran for mayor of Newark [New Jersey], and I was co-chair for the finance committee, and then they--a PAC [political action committee] was established, and I ended up being on the board of the PAC, which was really great. It raised a lot of money. But I was very hands on with that campaign which was time consuming. And so I'm on a number of other boards, and also I do have a real estate company that I started to renovate just some condos--and that's it--with the kids [Teresa Wells and Phillip Wells], but now my daughter is moving to London [England], so I won't be doing any real estate in London, right (laughter). So I'm waiting for that one last position. I'm sixty-four as of yesterday. I'm like, got to have--
Speaker 1: Your, your birthday was yesterday.
Speaker 2: Yesterday.
Speaker 1: Oh, you didn't say.
Speaker 2: The 9th, when was--oh, no, two days ago.
Speaker 1: Okay, two--
Speaker 2: My god, I can't remember--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) what day it is. This is the 10th [sic. September 11, 2014].
Speaker 1: Oh, so you were in California for that.
Speaker 2: We were in California. Yeah. We stayed a couple extra days.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which is nice 'cause Ted [Wells' husband, HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.] has been on a nine month trial, so for him to see light and air is wonderful. So I figure one more, you know, position at some point, and it could be, you know, a really key board position. I haven't really decided yet. But MWAA is time consuming. We, we spend a lot of time with MWAA, and I'm down there once every couple of weeks.
Speaker 1: MWAA.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, the Metropolitan Washington Airports--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --Authority. I'm down there a couple times a month with those meetings, and I'll be--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --down two or three days next week, but one more position, so maybe ambassador of the Turks and Caicos [Turks and Caicos Islands] (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: It would be perfect, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I'll give you an update--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --on what it's like to be an ambassador.
Speaker 1: So, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That'll be something else, huh?
Speaker 1: --you know--
Story_ID: 667186
Speaker 1: We talked about Ted [HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.], but your, your--you've had this partnership that has lasted how many years?
Speaker 2: Well, we've known each other for fifty, almost fifty years.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: But we've been married as of this December, forty-three. We did get married on Christmas day, so forty-three. And who's counting (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Do you know what--well, what, what did you attribute your success? Because, you know, mainly, you hear--I haven't been married, but you hear that couples stay--you know, they have to grow together, you know, and here--I mean, you met in high school, and, and you've gone places that you probably could not have dreamed at the time.
Speaker 2: That's really true. I think a lot of it--first of all, I think the best and easiest thing I can say is same profession. I think that made a big difference in the very beginning because I truly understood all the challenges that Ted was having, you know, with, you know, wanting to be a partner and having to work--he worked--he was a--considered the hardest working partner in the history of the firm [Lowenstein, Sandler, Brochin, Kohl, Fisher and Boylan; Lowenstein Sandler LLP]. He worked every weekend for the first ten years, every weekend. And then being a lawyer in Corporate America, I saw just how challenging it was and just how hard you really have to work, and, and being African American didn't make it any easier, so I got it from the very beginning. Had I not been a practicing attorney, I'm not sure I would have been as understanding of him just working all the time. I mean, he works all the time. But it--to me--it was, we were building something. Put the paper down a little bit. For me, we were just building something. And we had a vision about sort of building on what our ancestors had really done, and we--I think that vision never left us. And the other thing was, I think our personalities were very compatible because of our upbringing. We wanted a really nice family life. I think we both had that in common, so we were always thinking, okay, let's have a nice family vacation, and let's have a nice vacation for the two of us. But Ted's mother [Phyllis Wells] was a wonderful role model for me and wonderful mentor. I love the way he was raised by his mother. She was one of the most kind, one of the kindest most loving people you would ever meet, and she embraced my whole family. And because we were a little along the fringes most of the time, she would have these Sunday dinners, and this was more when I was in high school [Immaculate Conception Academy, Washington, D.C.], not as much as when I was much younger and going to museums, but much older. She would have lovely Sunday dinners and invite some of my siblings if they wanted to come, but their house was always a place of tranquility and warmth and love, and his mother expressed it through food, and she taught me how to cook, so I sort of--I saw Ted's lifestyle, and I thought, I really like that, and so it was a way for me to sort of, you know, craft, in my own mind, how I really wanted our life to be, you know. And he really very much wanted that because he had, you know, a wonderful, kind, generous, mother. And his house was the center of a lot of activity, so our homes from the very beginning, it was the place to be, you know, always the place to be for all the kids, the parties, the sleepovers, you know, all of the wonderful social things. You could always find my house loaded with kids, and, especially for my son [Phillip Wells] who is very social, and he had to have five or six boy friends sleeping over and Sunday morning, they had to be there, and they had to be there all the time, so that was really great, so I, I think it was just a combination of a lot of pieces that came together not necessarily because we thought them out as much as, you know, stars aligned along the way, you know, they did. And I, I think a lot of it was just right place at the right time, and then when things got hard, knowing how much harder they could be if you didn't, you know, want to stick it out. I mean, watching our families go through so much dysfunction, it's like, you know, and everything seemed almost minor, you know, not always, but when you--when something didn't go right, it just didn't seem worth complaining about or fighting about or breaking up about it, you know.
Story_ID: 667187
Speaker 1: Two last questions, what are your hopes--I mean, you came out of a, initially, a segregated environment [in Washington, D.C.], you know, inner city, and, you know--
Speaker 2: But segregated but we were in the majority.
Speaker 1: You were in the majority (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Majority.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Which makes a big, big--
Speaker 1: Big difference (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) difference.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean, all the years of I'm black and I'm proud--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --I had a big Afro.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: I felt as though I really, you know--
Speaker 1: You owned it.
Speaker 2: --was (unclear), I owned it. I was in a very--in some ways privileged situation; although, I wasn't able always to put my hands on it. 	You know, because I had, you know, okay schooling. I didn't have a lot of exposure to college and good graduate schools. I felt good about myself, but I didn't know how to translate that into, you know, success and better pedigree, you know.
Speaker 1: So when, when you look at the black community now because you've done a lot of work in that community, not that it's been exclusive, but a lot. So what are your hopes and concerns when you look at the community?
Speaker 2: Yeah. You know what, I really wish young people would finish their education without having families. I wish in our communities we could have more extended families. I was lucky to have like a surrogate parenting relationship for my children through Jack and Jill [Jack and Jill of America, Inc.], which is just one kind of an organization that if you form those kind of organizations, it could even be in your apartment building. It could even be through school friends, but I knew my, my kids were lucky because even though Ted [Wells' husband, HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.] was busy, busy, busy, my kids had a lot of people influencing them, and so I wasn't like, you know, alone trying to, you know, tell them, you know, teach them good values. They saw it all around them, all around them. There were so many parents who cared about your kids as much as you cared about them, and you cared about their kids. My kids would go into a home and immediately, if they were not doing something--Phillip [Phillip Wells] didn't take his hat off. "Phil, you didn't take your hat off." Or, "Teresa [Teresa Wells], did you just--look at that outfit. That's too short on you, girl." You name it, in terms of the value system. I just wish we could, you know, recreate that in our community so that all children would have that wonderful exposure to good solid values.
Story_ID: 667188
Speaker 1: And then number two, we made a point of the young people seeing us sticking together and no arguments. It was like no. And then Ted [Wells' husband, HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.] always wanted to have a household that had a certain amount of tranquility, so you don't have to have all of that turmoil, and we created a new normal. That's not normal. This is the new normal, and the new normal is for our kids, you graduate from high school. You go to college and graduate school if you want. You get married, and then you raise your family. I think one of the things that our--'cause right now in our communities is all these kids out of wedlock. If you go in the Newark Public Schools, I'll tell you the number one problem. Parents--kids who had kids. Why do we have gangs? We had gang--we never had gangs until the '40s [1940s] when we had the great migration from an agrarian society to an urban society. You didn't have grandma and the aunts and cousins. So what were you going to do? You were a latchkey kid. And there goes gangs, gangs. So we--I think we got to have that whole extended family thing again, you know, even if it's a partnership, and we've got to make kids our number one priority. Haven't we lost that? Our number one priority. When a kid turns five years old, a library card. Make them a priority, right. How many of us are really doing that for our children and exposing them to everything? I think about my dad [Ignatius Mitchell, Jr.], the Smithsonian [Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.]. Where would we be without a dad that cared about museums and reading, right? You know, the--everybody in the family is so well read. Look at the kids now. They don't read. They don't think about a world beyond that little teeny, you know, space that they're in that's so limiting and so boring. And no wonder you act out. You don't have any vision of what could be better in your life. So I think Ted and I through, you know, LDF [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.], NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], United Negro College Fund [UNCF], the schools and colleges that we've supported, we've tried to think about education, education and mentoring scholarship programs, performing arts centers, arts education. It's all about the kids, and that's my hope and dream that we all get onboard and just make every last one of them--my children adopted a shelter when they was growing up which was so important for them. They saw kids with metal plates in their heads. And they said, "Why is that?" Said, "Their parents beat them up. They've lost custody." They had a shelter that they would go to and volunteer. From the very beginning, our kids were very, very exposed philanthropically. For every social event, every political event, every nonprofit fundraiser. They were carrying the trays. Hanging up the coats. And then they, they had a shelter that they adopted, and they said, these kids have no parents. So for Christmas they would make the Christmas stockings and put their name on it, so I think developing empathy, I think is so important in our society. But all of us rallied around the kids. I think that's, you know, what we should continue to do, and I try to do that as much as I can at every single opportunity, and my kids have, too. My daughter [Teresa Wells] joined the New York Urban League, and my son [Phillip Wells] has wonderful mentees. My son, one of his mentees is a sophomore in college, and he's been mentoring since he was like eight years old and making sure that he did well on the SAT, so it's--I think it's all about the whole empathy thing and, and caring about the kids.
Story_ID: 667189
Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be? And I--
Speaker 2: Go ahead. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, I just--I ask that question given that you've done well financially and career wise, but philanthropy seems--you know, and giving, volunteers and then service seems to be--
Speaker 2: Yeah. I think I have--I hope I have set an example for other young people to get involved in their community at some level. I love my mentee [Shavar Jeffries] who just ran for the mayor of Newark [New Jersey], and I wish more young people could be like him. And this is a kid that grew up with two seventeen year old unwed parents and grandmother raised him. Mother murdered by the father and--stepfather. And so he goes off to Duke [Duke University, Durham, North Carolina] and Columbia [Columbia Law School, New York, New York] and then comes back and does this organization [iReform, Inc.], sets up an organization, to help parents navigate through the public schools [Newark Public School], and the civil rights law, and I, I think to myself, I hope I have done enough to say to other young people--all my mentees that I have, I have met through various phases of my life. There are many, many, many of them. First and foremost, try your best to give back to just somebody who has less than you do and set a good example. Set a good example for them about what is important in life. And I think what's important is really family. For Thanksgiving, we have eighty people for Thanksgiving now. We started--I have hosted Thanksgiving for my family from my first house in West Orange [New Jersey] in 1979 right to today. I try to have all my siblings, nieces, nephews. And if nothing else, just giving them the exposure, you can do so much more than you think you can do. Don't let anybody, you know, hold you back, so I think just family and just sharing that with family is--I would--I wouldn't really know my nieces and nephews, I don't think, unless I hosted the all of these things. Everybody is not in a position to do it or have the wherewithal. They're too busy or they--where they live, but I, I would hope that Ted [HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.] and I have set a good example for the next generation that family is important and, no, it's not always easy. And for women, I do believe you can have it all. I really do. For those women that--I mean, it's okay to give up your career and raise your family. That's very important. But you know what, I think I'm a little partial. And I say, if you, if you got that got that education, and you took up that spot, please use it. Please use it. You know, and please tell women that you can do it all. I think, I think you can do it all at the--all at the same time. I mean, I'm prejudiced in that regard. I mean, and people would say not necessarily. I think you can if you really want to, and I want more women to see that you can do it all. When I took my sabbatical, my daughter [Teresa Wells] said to me, "Please don't come to school in jeans and volunteer in survival shop. I will be devastated. I want you in your suit and your pearls when you come to my school" (laughter). She said, "That's who are you. You are not a housewife." I said, "Well, that's a homemaker." "Mom, you're not a housewife. Don't go there." I said, "Okay, okay." So for some young women maybe they really, really need that in order to empower them, and I think--I'd like to see a whole lot more women--I think we tend to say it's so hard and, and not do both, and maybe they end up being better mothers than I was maybe. I don't know. But my prejudice, my inclination, is stick it out and find the resources 'cause I think that's--I think you're a better role model. But that's very, very--I mean, that's every--when you see them on the TV, you're going to say, oh, that's quite a--that's very opinionated, but it's, it's just, you know, how I feel. I got that education, and I just felt so obligated to use it, so.
Speaker 1: Thank, thank you. Thank you.
