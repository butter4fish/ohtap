Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewing today for The HistoryMakers archive.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, could you please state your full name and spell it for us, please.
Speaker 2: Okay.  My name is Hamilton Strawbridge Cloud, II, H-A-M-I-L-T-O-N, S-T-R-A-W-B-R-I-D-G-E C-L-O-U-D, the second.
Speaker 1: Now is there a story behind your middle name?
Speaker 2: Yes, my dad's name was Hamilton Strawbridge Cloud, and his grandfather's name was Hamilton Strawbridge.  And Hamilton Strawbridge, the, the family history is, was one of the first black millionaires in the country.  And he lived in Birmingham, Alabama, and he was in the life insurance business and was a part owner of the Birmingham Black Barons.  And my dad remembers going to Black Barons' baseball games and seeing Satchel Paige and some of the other famous players of that era, Josh Gibson, etc.  And my grandfather, I'm sorry, my great-grandfather Hamilton Strawbridge, was basically wiped out by the stock market crash of 1929.  And I remember him here in California and apparently I was maybe two years old, but I have a memory of my parents putting me on his bed when he was ailing and, and on his way out.  And my dad told me that after the stock market crash, his grandfather rarely spoke to anyone after that.  Just you know decided he didn't want to speak anymore, but he did move out here to California and this is where he passed.
Speaker 1: That's quite a story, quite a story.  Okay.  And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: November 30, 1952 in Los Angeles, California, Queen of Angels Hospital which apparently had, had--was one of the few hospitals in Los Angeles that would allow black people to, to come there to have their babies, cause it was not in the black part of town.  I think it was a Catholic hospital, and it's not a hospital anymore.  The building is still there, but I remember my parents telling me that, that it was one of the few where black folks could go and have, have their kids.
Speaker 1: Okay and so what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I am the Director of Special Projects for Congresswoman Maxine Waters.  So I am a federal government employee, what they call a congressional staff member.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right now what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is April 29th, 2011.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We are in the Congresswoman's office in South Central Los Angeles, Broadway and 102nd Street.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 40164
Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth, there are five lightweight, 'People' magazine-ish type questions.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That we ask, it's sort of a warm up, and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: First one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: A favorite food, that would be peanut butter [laughs] undoubtedly.  That's an easy one.
Speaker 1: Okay a favorite color.
Speaker 2: Green.
Speaker 1: All right, favorite time of the year.
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  Living in, I, I went to college on the East Coast, and it was the first time I really was aware of the seasons, and out here in Los Angeles [California] we don't feel them quite the same way.  But I, if I had to pick a--generally I think I like summer time in general.  But if I had to pick a favorite, it would be fall on the East Coast when the leaves are changing.
Speaker 1: Okay just an aside here.  When I came, I saw in the lobby there's a picture of a snow, a snowy scene.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: In the lobby herein the office and I, I don't--
Speaker 2: I don't know where that's from either.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah I, I don't know.  But I lived for five years on the East Coast and I always loved fall because of the, the changing of the leaves.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Probably would be Maui in Hawaii.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: With, with Jamaica being a close second.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now the last one is:  Do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: That's a good one.  I don't, if I had to pick one, it might be a Bob Marley lyric from a song called "Three Little Birds" where the refrain is:  "Cause everything's going to be all right.  Don't worry about a thing, 'cause every little thing is going to be all right."
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 40165
Speaker 1: So I'm going to ask you about your family history now.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask you about your mother's side of the family and your father's side.  But we'll start with your mother's side first.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Frances Willard Smith Cloud.  F-R-A-N-C-E-S, W-I-L-L-A-R-D, Smith, S-M-I-T-H, and then Cloud, C-L-O-U-D.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in Chicago, Illinois on December 31st, 1927.
Speaker 1: Okay now how far back can you trace your mother's family and, and where to?
Speaker 2: Good question and, and not as far back as I would like to.  But we have had a couple of Smith family reunions because my grandfather, her, her father lived to be 100.  And we had family reunions on his 90th, his 95th and his 100th birthdays.  And they were from, before moving to Chicago, they were from the Carolinas, North Carolinas, Winston-Salem.  And, and the Greensboro, High Point area of North Carolina.  And I'll never forget at one of the family reunions when they were telling the family history, which I wish I had paid more attention to, being amazed and, and shocked at the mix of the family and how much closer the white roots were than I had ever been aware of before.  Because my grandfather who was Neil Dowell Smith, to my amazement, was only 25 percent African American.  But he was very much a race man and, and very proud of that and, and that's why growing up I had no idea that that was the case.  And some of those stories as, as we've come to learn as we grow older, are not shared for different reasons.  You know sometimes there were rapes or cases where people did not want to be part of the family.  And so some of that history would be buried.  But his, his roots were there in, in the Carolinas.  Then my mom's mother was also from that area and she was very light skinned and also I, I believe there had been a rape in her family.  Maybe with her grandparents, I'm not sure.  And, and I'm blanking now, wait a minute, Jarrett was her maiden name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: Okay now are there any stories from--about how the family migrated to Chicago or, or stories before that time in North Carolina?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My, the Smith family, there were seven kids and my grandfather was the only non-musician in the family.  Some of them taught.  They owned a, apparently a very famous music store in Chicago where a lot of the black musicians would come through and, and hang out whenever they were in Chicago.  And in those days they were selling sheet music and piano roles, cause this was before phonograph records.  And my grandfather was very musical, but was the only one who did not become a professional musician, either a music teacher or, or a performing musician.  And he was in the postal service, he was a mail carrier in Chicago.  In fact one of the family stories is that the Valentine's Day Massacre was on his postal route, and luckily he wasn't there that day or, or not at that time.  But I'm not sure of why they moved to Chicago, but the Smiths did move to Chicago, probably part of one of the northern migrations.  And, and made their home there.  Keeping roots in, in North Carolina.  And it's interesting that now some of my Smith cousins are moving back to North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay yeah, North Carolina is booming now, Charlotte.
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah in fact I think that's where the Democratic Convention is going to be in, in 2012.
Speaker 1: Yeah and they just got Cam Newton [football quarterback for the Carolina Panthers of the National Football League] [laughs].
Speaker 2: [Laughs] Yes.
Speaker 1: But what was the name of the music store, do, do you know?
Speaker 2: No I don't know the name of the music store.  I, I need to look that up.
Speaker 1: So this was like--
Speaker 2: This was in probably the '20s [1920s] and '30s [1930's], yeah.  Cause my mom was born in, in '27 [1927] in Chicago, so that, that's when it would have been.
Story_ID: 40166
Speaker 1: My grandmother by the way was Mary Ellen Jarrett Smith on my mom's [Frances Willard Smith Cloud] side.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now what did she do for a living?
Speaker 1: She was a homemaker.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, and also made--when they moved back to Winston-Salem [North Carolina], she made these very famous Moravian cookies that were wafer thin.  And a lot of the black women in Winston-Salem would bake these cookies that were then sold--not by themselves.  They, they would bake them and then they were turned over to whatever the organization was that actually sold them.  But they're very ginger spice cookies, they were called Moravian cookies.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: And they had, they had five kids.  So she was a very busy homemaker.
Story_ID: 40167
Speaker 1: Now did your mother [Frances Willard Smith Cloud] talk about growing up and what her aspirations were when she was--
Speaker 2: Yes.  My mom was--I think in her heart she was a dancer.  In fact, the story goes that that's how she and my dad [Hamilton Strawbridge Cloud] met.  They both went to Talladega College [Talladega, Alabama].  My dad was seven years older than my mom.  So he had graduated and was in the military and came back to visit his alma mater and there was a talent show and my mom was one of the dancers in the talent show.  And that's where he was smitten and they met.  But I think that--and in fact she was a social worker in Chicago [Illinois] before they got married.  So she either wanted to be if not a dancer, a social worker or a librarian, cause she loved books.  And that's what she did before they got married.
Speaker 1: Okay so they met in Talladega but now, now was she a social worker before she went to Talladega or after?
Speaker 2: No, after.
Speaker 1: Afterwards.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So after she finished Talladega, she moved back to Chicago and they courted while my dad went to dental school.  He was in the [U.S.] Navy during World War II, and then the U.S. paid for him to go to dental school in Chicago.  So he went to Northwestern Dental School, where he was one of the first black students to graduate from Northwestern Dental School.
Speaker 1: Okay now, now let's--well let's just go, go to his side of the family.
Speaker 2: Yeah I'm sorry.  I, I'm jumping all around.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's fine.
Speaker 2: So yeah they, they courted in Chicago and were married in 1950 and, and moved to Los Angeles [California].
Story_ID: 40168
Speaker 1: Okay so on my dad's side--
Speaker 2: Can you give us your dad's full name?
Speaker 1: Sure, Hamilton Strawbridge Cloud.
Speaker 2: Same, same thing.
Speaker 1: Same as mine.  And he grew up in Birmingham, Alabama.
Speaker 2: Okay and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 1: His date of birth is February 14th, 1921 in Birmingham.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And his father was a professional photographer.  And his name was, was Frank Herman Cloud.  And he was one of the first black professional photographers, not only in Birmingham, but then when he moved to Los Angeles [California], he, he literally if not the first, was one of the first to have a studio here in Los Angeles.  There was an exhibit at the African American Museum that featured black professional photographers in Los Angeles history and he was, he was part of that exhibit.
Speaker 2: So he's someone that I would imagine was, well he was shooting pic--pictures in the 1920s, early '20s [1920s] and the teens and '20s [1920s].
Speaker 1: Yes.  In fact he shot quite a few covers of the 'Crisis Magazine' for the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] which I, I always thought was one of those great synergistic stories because you know many years later I ended up producing the Image Awards for the NAACP.  So I always felt that, that historical connection.  But some great family history on that side.  The, the story goes that my grandfather was run out of Birmingham for being uppity.  And literally had to, to leave town overnight because he was told if, if he wasn't gone by the next day, he was a dead man.  He was very light skinned and very proud and very smart.  And obviously upset the wrong people and, and was run out of town.
Story_ID: 40169
Speaker 1: Some, some great history there if, if I can share a story with you.  This is how I came to truly believe in the spiritual world and the fact that our ancestors are watching over us and, and are proud of us, and, and have a hand in, in helping us.  I had a speaking engagement at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville.  And this was in the--I was working for Quincy [Jones] at the time, so this was in the '90s [1990s], and I knew that my [paternal] grandfather [Frank Herman Cloud] had grown up in Knoxville [Tennessee].  But I had never been there.  And so I asked my dad and my grandmother who, who were both alive at the time, to tell me what they remembered.  And, and they didn't remember much but my grandmother who I haven't told you about yet on my dad's [Hamilton Strawbridge Cloud] side, remembered that my grandfather had grown up in a house across the road from Knoxville College, which is a small African American college in Knoxville.  And the only thing she remembered was there was a fresh water well and a chicken coop on the family property.  She didn't remember the street name or the address or anything like that.  And my, my dad had never been there, but he told me that we had some relatives there named Hardin (ph.) who had been my great-grandmother's maiden name was Hardin.  Her name was Americas Pocahontas Hardin.  And that she had married Peter Cooper Cloud.  And they were my grandfather's parents.  And I remember him showing me some pictures of Americas Pocahontas Hardin and she was very dark skinned, but obviously mixed I think with Cherokee.  And that's all that they remembered.  Okay and, and my grandmother also gave me a phone number for a Hardin cousin named Luther Hardin.  And I tried calling the number, but I never got an answer or an answering machine.  So I didn't know if the number was old, no longer good, but I tried to reach him and, and I couldn't.  And so I called Knoxville College and I asked them if they had any kind of archives.  And I spoke to the librarian of their library on campus.  And the woman said what's your name?  And, and I told her.  And she said that's funny, my last name is Cloud.  And there aren't that many Clouds.  So we, we could not figure out the connection.  But I said okay I'll be down there next week and, and I'd love to swing by and just see if I can find anything in your archives about my grandfather.  And my grandmother also told me that Peter Cooper Cloud had worked for Knoxville College running a satellite high school in another part of Alabama.  Okay so I go down and I had two days there, and so the day before my speaking engagement, I went by Knoxville College and went to the library.  And I walked in and the librarian who I had spoken to on the phone, both of our mouths dropped because it was so obvious that we had come from--we looked like brother and sister.  And what was amazing is that we still could not figure out the connection.  But we looked so much alike that there was no way we, we aren't related.  So we had a great time trying to figure it out, could, couldn't do it.
Story_ID: 40170
Speaker 1: And then she [librarian at Knoxville College, Knoxville, Tennessee] took me over to the archives and you know when we think of archives, we think of, of some organized library of some kind.  Well it wasn't that way.  It was a room full of boxes with books and papers, you know, just all over the place.  They had not had a chance to really organize their archives.  And I remember laughing and thinking okay, this, this is a wild goose chase.  But I had a, you know, abut an hour and a half to, to kill, so let me just see what I can find.  And again, this is where I feel like this could not be coincidence.  I walk to over one of literally you know, a hundred cardboard boxes filled with books.  And I pick up the very first box and I open it up and I open up the very first book I pulled out of it and found a photograph of my [paternal] grandfather [Frank Herman Cloud] from a college yearbook.  And I didn't even know what year my grandfather had graduated or anything.  So this was you know, just purely by chance I opened up and found this photograph of him in I can't remember the graduating class.  But there he was.  And my heart started racing and I'm feeling like Alex Haley, you know.  I, I'm tracking down family roots.  And so I went and made a Xerox copy of, of the photograph cause there were maybe fifteen people in that graduating class and, and there was my grandfather.  Okay so I had maybe a half an hour left and again thinking I, I'm not going to be that lucky a second time, I go to another box and I open it up and there's a, a ledger, handwritten ledger in pencil.  And I open it to a page and there's an entry where they had paid P. C. Cloud, Peter Cooper Cloud [Cloud's paternal great-grandfather] $28 a month to be the headmaster of this school in Millers Ferry, Alabama.  And now my heart is racing because this, this is just an amazing thing that I would find those two things, you know, within an hour and a half's time.  So I thanked the librarian and I asked her if she happened to know where there might be a house nearby where there was a fresh water well and a chicken coop.  You know it sounds like a ridiculous question.  But she didn't.  But she said you know what?  There's a street right behind the library here.  Why don't you go up there and, and walk down the street and, and ask some people and see if anybody knows?  And so I did, and, and I ran out of time.  And I didn't run into anybody and I didn't see anything.  But I said to myself I'm going to come back tomorrow morning before my speaking engagement and, and take her advice and walk the street and see if, if I meet anybody who might know.
Story_ID: 40171
Speaker 1: So the next day I come back [to Knoxville College, Knoxville, Tennessee] and being from California, I'm not, we're not as outgoing as people are in the South.  And so I, I'm mustering up the courage to you know walk down the street and say excuse me, you know, do you know where there's a fresh water well?  And I don't know if this is the right street or, or anything because as I said, [paternal] my grandmother didn't know the address or, or anything like that.  There's an elderly gentleman out raking his front yard.  And before I could muster up the courage to, to go over and talk to him, he says how y'all doing today?  And, and that was enough opening for me to say oh, I'm great.  And I said I'm, I'm here tracking down some family roots.  And sure enough we start up a conversation and he, he says what's your name?  And I told him.  And he says I know who you are.  We're related.  I'm Leroy Hardin.  And so literally he was out in front of his house at this time, raking his yard as I walked by.  And again, this couldn't be an accident.  So he proceeds to take me inside and introduce me to his wife who had just had knee surgery I think.  Honey, we got some relatives here from California.  He knew my whole family story because--and, and then he says, he says that's where your grandfather grew up.  And he points to the house next door to his.  And I said was there a fresh water well?  Yeah that's where the well was.  Was there a chicken coop?  Yes, that's where the chicken coop was.  He said when I grew up your grandfather used to take me rabbit hunting up in the hills.  And, and so again he proceeds to tell me you're Hamilton Cloud's [Cloud's father] son.  Your uncle is Herman Cloud and he says I've never met your father or your uncle.  But I know who you are.  And so he was again, Leroy Hardin.  And my heart is just racing at this point and, and luckily I did have a camera, so I took some pictures and I had a Dictaphone with me and so I was able to record him.  And he said how long are you in town?  And I told him and he says do you have time--let me run you out to the cemetery.  And I said okay.  And we get in his car and he was in his eighties [age], his early eighties at the time.  And he's driving this Cadillac, palming the steering wheel, you know, but this was his town.  So he takes me out to a small cemetery that I never would have found on my own because it was unmarked.  It--the black cemetery was across the road from the white cemetery.  The big white cemetery was marked.  But this was an unmarked cemetery literally in a curve in the road in Knoxville, Tennessee that you know obviously I had no idea existed.  And he says so walk, walk over there and, and look at those gravestones.  And so I walk across the cemetery and I literally walk up on the graves of Americas Pocahontas Hardin Cloud [Cloud's paternal great-grandmother].  And her parents who were John and Mary Hardin.  And at that point I burst into tears because here I was walking up on my great-grandmother's grave and my great-great-grandparents' graves who were slaves that I never would have found on my own.  I didn't know they existed, never would have thought to look for them.  But because of these amazing circumstances, I was walking up on their grave.  And, and I burst into tears and couldn't believe it and, and when I came back and told my dad [Hamilton Strawbridge Cloud], he couldn't believe it either cause he had, he had never been to Knoxville and didn't know any of those stories.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay that's quite a story and I'm glad you told it.  Yeah we don't get a lot of real good stories about people searching for their ancestors, but that's a good one.
Speaker 1: And again, that's where I came to believe that, that I had to have been guided by some spirits because there were too many coincidences there to have happened completely on their own.  And, and to be in touch with that part of the family.  I had never heard of John and Mary Hardin.  I, I had heard of Americas Pocahontas, but I didn't know any of the family history.
Story_ID: 40172
Speaker 1: And by the way another piece of the history that, that's important that I learned was that Peter Cooper Cloud [Cloud's paternal great-grandfather] who's entry had been in that, that ledger for the college [Knoxville College, Knoxville, Tennessee], was killed for teaching young black kids to read in Alabama and also cause at his school that he operated in Millers Ferry [Alabama], apparently it was--because Millers Ferry was so small, it was an integrated school, which is very unusual at that time and so there was some white kids in the school.  And he disciplined some of them and that did not sit well with their parents and the local I assume [Ku Klux] Klan.  And so they literally ran him out of town, but shot him in the back as he was leaving, and he had to swim across a river outside of Millers Ferry.  I don't know the name of the river.  And he, he made it across but he caught pneumonia and died as a result.  And that's another part of the family history that, that had not been told very often until I came back with, with all this information about the Hardins.
Speaker 2: Can you remember what, what his time period was?
Speaker 1: No.  It must have been either in the teens or the '20s [1920s].
Speaker 2: Peter Cooper Cloud?
Speaker 1: Peter Cooper Cloud, because okay so he was my, my grandfather.  Yeah it may have been in the first decade of the, of the twentieth century.
Speaker 2: Around the turn of the century.
Speaker 1: Yeah, around the turn of the century, yeah.
Speaker 2: Twentieth century.
Speaker 1: Because I, I don't know my grandfather.  If my dad was born in '21 [1921], then his dad [Frank Herman Cloud] was probably born in the '90s [1890s], 1890s, so yeah, that, that probably would have been around the turn of the century, century.
Story_ID: 40173
Speaker 1: Now your father [Hamilton Strawbridge Cloud] grew up in--
Speaker 2: Birmingham [Alabama].
Speaker 1: Birmingham.  So then the family then moved from Knoxville [Tennessee] to Birmingham.
Speaker 2: Yes, and, and because my [paternal] grandmother had said she only visited my [paternal] grandfather [Frank Herman Cloud] once in Knoxville, I'm assuming they, they met in, in, probably in Birmingham.  And so my grandmother was Lillian Strawbridge, which goes back to your original question.  And they met and, and my grandmother, Lillian Strawbridge, was also a graduate of Talladega College [Talladega, Alabama], which she would have graduated I guess in the teens [1913-1919].  And that was incredibly rare in those days too, for a black woman to, to be able to go to college and graduate.  So she attended Talladega before my father and my mom [Frances Willard Smith Cloud].
Speaker 1: Okay so, yeah so your father's paternal grandfather was run out of Birmingham for being uppity, okay.
Speaker 2: My, my father's father.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Was run out of Birmingham.  Yeah and my father's paternal grandfather, Peter Cooper Cloud, was run out of Millers Ferry, Alabama for disciplining a white student at, at his school.
Speaker 1: Yeah that sounds, that's interesting.  That's a heck of a story right there.  That would make a movie [laughs].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah it is, it's great.  Very rich.
Story_ID: 40174
Speaker 1: So your father [Hamilton Strawbridge Cloud], did he grow up in Birmingham [Alabama]?  So he grew up in Birmingham.
Speaker 2: Yes my dad grew up in Birmingham, and--
Speaker 1: What were his aspirations to grow up as?
Speaker 2: Okay, my dad said that as a child, so he was born in '21 [1921], and went to college when he was very young, I think he was fourteen [years old] when he went to college at Talladega [College], fourteen or fifteen.  He said when he was growing up, the, there were limited options, you know if you were a college graduate in terms of professions.  That either you could be a teacher, or maybe a Pullman porter.  Or an undertaker.  And so he was planning to be a mortician.  And he trained and worked in high school at a, a mortuary.  And then had a mentor who talked him into becoming a dentist.  And obviously there were very few African American dentists at that time.  But when--after he served in the [U.S.] Navy in War World II, and they, they offered to pay for dental school if he enlisted in the [U.S.] Army.  And so he was able to go to Northwestern [Dental School, Chicago, Illinois] with the, the Army paying for his dental school.  And unfortunately he, he and my mom [Frances Willard Smith Cloud] moved to Los Angeles [California] in 1950.  He followed his brother, Herman, Frank Herman Cloud, Jr., to Los Angeles.  And then was called up because he was still in the Army and had to fulfill his obligation, and the Korean War broke out.  And he had to go serve in Korea.  So he ended up serving in the Navy in World War II and then the Army in Korea, and was a field dentist, literally out in the middle of combat in, in Korea.  And had nightmares about it the rest of his life.  But he survived, fortunately and, and when he came back, I was born.  And my family nickname is Chisai, which is a Korean and Japanese word.  And, and all of the little boys in Korea were called Chisai, which is spelled C-H-I-S-A-I.  And so when I was born, I was small, a little premature I think and, and small.  And so my nickname became Chisai which is, is how the family knows me.
Story_ID: 40175
Speaker 1: Let me go back for a minute.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: To Northwestern.  Now your, your father [Hamilton Strawbridge Cloud] at Northwestern from what I--stuff we have, the stuff we have on file, he was friends with Leroy Branton?
Speaker 2: Yes, Leo Branton [also a HistoryMaker].
Speaker 1: Leo Branton.
Speaker 2: Yes, good research.
Speaker 1: A famous lawyer--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: In L.A. [Los Angeles].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Was a lawyer for Angela Davis [political activist, scholar and author].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Quite a few other important people.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Dalton Trumbo [screenwriter and novelist], Nat King Cole [singer and musician; jazz pianist].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Dorothy Dandridge [actress and singer].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Have you guys done Leo Branton?
Speaker 1: Yes we have.
Speaker 2: Great, okay.
Speaker 1: And, and he also--I think Eugene Pincham became a judge in Chicago [Illinois], well known in Chicago and Cecil Partee, very famous politician in Chicago was also in school around the same time.  Did you--do those names--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Other than Leo Branton.
Speaker 2: My, my dad, Leo Branton was my dad's attorney here in L.A. and told me that they had met, my dad told me that they had met while they were both back there.  And I talked to Mr. Branton after my dad passed and we had a great conversation.  And I, I still have not met him and I'm looking forward to it.  I, I hope to do so soon.  And I asked Mr. Branton if, if he was writing his autobiography because he has an incredible story, and, and he said he is working on it.  So that's one I look forward to, to reading.  And no I don't know the other two names that you mentioned.
Speaker 1: Pincham and Cecil Partee.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Cecil Partee was a, a very important politician on the South Side of Chicago, very close to the Daleys.  And Judge Pincham was an activist, you know a lawyer and judge, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Well respected by everyone.
Speaker 2: Okay.  A lot of my mom's family is still in Chicago.  The Smiths and the Wells family.  And, and we--some of the family reunions that we've had have been in Chicago and I, and I love Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 40176
Speaker 1: All right so, so the Korean War, now this is--I want to go back to that too because this--a lot of people don't realize, you know, what a dramatic story the Korean War was for black soldiers.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I think for the first time the--in the modern era they were on the front lines in combat.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Newly desegregated [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: With issues.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: The Army had issues and the--the war had its issues too.
Speaker 2: And my dad [Hamilton Strawbridge Cloud] took some great photographs in Korea, which are on slides which, which I have now.  And as I said, he had, had nightmares about, about Korea the rest of his life because it was so cold and you know sleeping in fox holes, not knowing if you were going to make it till morning, had an affect on all their psyches I'm sure for the rest of their lives.  But my, my dad--it's interesting.  My dad said because I, I came of age during the Viet Nam War and my dad said that he wished I could have the military experience because he thought it was incredibly valuable for the individuals.  But there was no way as he put it, that he was going to let me go to Vietnam and repeat the experience that he had had in Korea.  And so he was adamant and, and was very active in the anti-war movement.  He joined another--it was called 'Another Mother for Peace', which he always thought was a, a funny twist on words.  So he said yeah, I'm Another Mother for Peace.  But he, he was prepared to take me to Canada if necessary, if I was drafted to, to have to go to Vietnam.  Just because he, he felt that, that it was such a waste of human potential and human life for reasons that were not ultimately important, especially to African Americans who, you know as many of them had the experience of coming back from a war too and coming back from Korea and finding out that things were not any better here in the [United] States, and, and that they still had to fight the same battles here that, that they theoretically were fighting for overseas.  You know, for the same freedoms that, that they were purportedly fighting for other people, that they did not have when they returned to the [United] States.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 40177
Speaker 1: Now, now you were born in 1952.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Here and close, close by where, where we are now [in Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 2: About five miles north maybe, eight miles north.  In--sort of near downtown Los Angeles in, in Queen of Angels Hospital.
Speaker 1: Okay now when you consider--
Speaker 2: I, I'm sorry.  My parents [Frances Willard Smith Cloud and Hamilton Strawbridge Cloud] were living about a mile from where we are now when I was born.  And then my [paternal] grandmother, Lillian Cloud, ended up living in the house where I was born for another fifteen or twenty years.  So we would visit this part of town quite a bit, and so I have an affinity for what's called South Central, Watts, Willowbrook, this area.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 40178
Speaker 1: Now when you think about your mother, your mother and father's [Frances Willard Smith Cloud and Hamilton Strawbridge Cloud] talents, their dispositions, their habits, their intellects, their political views, their looks even.  Who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: My, my dad.  Definitely look--people say I look very much like my dad.  So I was the oldest child, I am the oldest child and the only son.  And people say that I resemble my father, I have a lot of his mannerisms and, and habits, and I do find myself every now and then I hear my dad's voice coming out of me or I'll laugh and hear my dad's laugh or I'll do something with my upper lip that my dad used to do.  And, and so I'd say my, my dad.  Though there are other parts of me that, you know my mom's nervous system I definitely inherited.  And sensitivity to the sun.  You know I'll break out from UV [ultra violet] exposure or whatever.  So I'm, I'm a good mix, but I definitely resemble my dad.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, now you have sisters?
Speaker 2: Yes, I have two younger sisters.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: One lives here in Los Angeles [California] and one lives in Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 40179
Speaker 1: Now so your household growing up consisted of your mother [Frances Willard Smith Cloud], father [Hamilton Strawbridge Cloud], you and your two sisters?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And we were very close to my uncle, my dad's brother, older brother, Frank Herman Cloud [Jr.], and, and my [paternal] grandmother Lillian Cloud.  And then my mom's parents [Neil Smith and Mary Ellen Jarrett Smith] would come out and stay with us for months at a time, every three or four years.  Because they had five kids.  And they would, they would come and visit us.  And, and one thing I--two stories I'd like to tell about my, my, my mother's father, Neil Smith, who was a postal carrier in Chicago [Illinois].  As I said, he was the only one of his family who were not professional musicians.  But he sang in his church choir, played the piano.  And, and one of the things that he did for all five of his children--and, and this is on a postal carrier's retirement income, which had to be very limited, is he made a point of buying a piano for each of the families.  So that we would have a piano in the house to hopefully be able to express ourselves musically.  And I'm sure that that had an impact on my own love of music.  And, and, and ironically my dad was--when he was in the [U.S.] Navy, in World War II, he was a Navy musician and pay--played in the Navy bands on the East Coast.  And he used to make a joke that when, when I ended up going to college on the East Coast, he said I can tell you where all, all the bars are in New Haven [Connecticut].  But I, I don't necessarily know where Yale [University] is.  Because as a musician, he played the East Coast and he always said that if he hadn't met my mom, he probably would have died in a gutter somewhere because my mom helped him stay on a straight and narrow and, and finish dental school and, and go down that path.  But in his heart I think he was a musician also.  He played E-flat clarinet and, and saxophone.  So a lot of music in the family.  And I, I know that between my mom's love of dancing and my dad's music and, and my grandfather's love of music, that definitely contributed to my own love of music and, and that led to a lot of what I did in the entertainment industry.
Speaker 1: Now did your mother continue to take dance classes or--
Speaker 2: No, but she always paid attention to the dance world and, and my sisters did, and now my daughter who's my mom's granddaughter, that--her aspiration is to be a dancer.  And, and that's got to be in the genes.  Cause my mom always moved like a dancer and loved to dance though she didn't do it professionally.  But whenever we had a party, she, she was always one of the first up on the dance floor.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 40180
Speaker 1: If, if I can tell you one other story--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --about my [maternal] grandfather [Neil Smith], and I'll try to do it without welling up.  But again, in, in hindsight when you--as a child you don't think about money and the absence of it.  Cause growing up, you know I knew we were middle class and I never wanted for anything.  But I also knew we didn't have a lot of money.  Cause we lived in the middle class neighborhood and, and my, my grandfather who was the postal carrier, I'll never forget one time visiting them in Winston-Salem [North Carolina], he asked me to go for--he, he, he used to love to walk.  And he asked me to go for a walk with him and, and as kids you know, we were like oh, do we have to?  You know.  And that day I said sure I, I'll go for a walk with you.  And I had no idea where we were going.  And we ended up walking for hours halfway across town I'm sure.  And he was going to deliver a check that he had written for, for $10 to a program that the local gas company had for families who couldn't pay their gas bills.  And he was walking it over to save the stamp as opposed to mailing it.  And stamps probably cost 25 cents at that time [crying].  Sorry.  And I was just so moved by the fact that my grandfather who would wear pants until they had holes in them and wear shoes until they had holes in them, felt that it was important to give back whatever he could to families who were less fortunate.  And so here he was walking this check for $10 across town.  And I think that that will have a lasting impact on, on how I approach life and hopefully how my, my daughter does.  That whatever we do, we have to figure out how to give back to people who haven't had the good fortune that we have.  And that will be my favorite memory of my grandfather.
Speaker 2: This is, this is Neil Smith.
Speaker 1: Neil Smith, yeah.  Sorry.
Speaker 2: Okay that's all right.
Story_ID: 40181
Speaker 1: I, I don't know if we, we said enough about your other grandfather [paternal], the photographer.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Before we move on.
Speaker 2: Frank Herman Cloud.
Speaker 1: Frank Herman Cloud.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Very--I'll have to share a photograph I have of you, with you of my grandfather holding me as, when I was a baby.  Again very light skinned, don't know if he, he could have passed if he wanted to, but possibly.  I mean he was that light skinned.  But very, very proud African American who moved to California after he was chased out of Birmingham [Alabama], and, and as I said, was one of the first black professional photographers here in Los Angeles [California] to have a studio on Western Avenue.  And I remember growing up he took some incredible photographs of us as children that were, they were staged, you know, they were studio photographs.  But you can see the artistry in them even today.  Especially to capture kids, you know and, and cause kids are not the easiest to photograph.  But what's great is that my dad [Hamilton Strawbridge Cloud] then had photography as a hobby.  I have carried it on.  And my cousin, one of my cousins is a professional photographer.  So those genes I think have carried on in the family.
Speaker 1: Now did, did he have a chance to I guess photograph some of the local Los Angeles celebrities like, like James Van Der Zee did in New York?
Speaker 2: You know I'm sure he did and my cousin has kept his archive.  And, and I haven't seen it recently, so I'm not sure.  But I'm assuming he did.  And, and I do know when he was shooting covers of the 'Crisis', they tended to be just regular folks at, at that time.  But my, my grandmother--I, I have seen an issue of the 'Crisis' where his wife, my [paternal] grandmother Lillian, was the subject of the photograph.  And so he, he did shoot a lot of the Crisis covers.  But I don't know, I, I'm sure he did, and I need to explore that to, to see what Los Angeles history came through his studio.
Speaker 1: The exhibit that, they, they held here at the--you said it was at the--
Speaker 2: California African American Museum.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, the early days.
Speaker 1: Okay these, these were photos primarily of, of local people.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes of Los Angeles, African Americans in, in Los Angeles history.  And this was fifteen years ago.  So I don't remember many of the subjects of those photographs, but I'm sure that, that he probably did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 40182
Speaker 1: Now, now what, what would be the name of the area of town that you grew up in [Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2: Okay I grew up in an area called Leimert Park, which is near Crenshaw.  One of the things we were most proud of is that Mayor Tom Bradley lived right down the street, literally about ten houses down the street from us when he was a policeman and then a councilman, and then mayor, until there was an official mayor's residence he, he continued to live on our street.  It was Welland Avenue in Leimert Park, and as I said when, when we moved there, the neighborhood was--my parents [Frances Willard Smith Cloud and Hamilton Strawbridge Cloud] integrated that neighborhood.  And so the neighborhood was still very mixed, and it became a Black/White/Asian neighborhood.  So my elementary school and junior high school experience was very mixed.  And, and "White Flight" eventually you know caused most of the Anglos to, to leave the area.  But it's still a, a really stable middle class neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 40183
Speaker 1: Now can you describe the house you grew up in and what was some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Okay.  We--it was a, a two bedroom house, which we remodeled to make it a three bedroom house.  One story, no basement.  We had a backyard and my dad [Hamilton Strawbridge Cloud]--another one of his hobbies was carpentry.  And so he would build, he built a playhouse for us that was a fort, you know or a hospital, or whatever our imaginations would, would turn it into and we'd always climb up on it and jump off, and, and fight our imaginary gun battles back there in the back yard.  We had a basketball hoop so we, we often played basketball.  My mom [Frances Willard Smith Cloud] was a great cook.  So we had great, great meals.  We had a patio which we barbecued on and so a lot of entertaining in the backyard.  In fact there was a documentary that Luey [ph.] Lomax did in the 1960s called 'Walk a Mile in My Shoes', which was one of the, the first documentaries on local television about African Americans.  And they chose to shoot some of it in our back yard to show middle class African Americans coming together socially cause I guess that had never been seen on television before.  So I, I remember that.  So great childhood, hung out with the neighborhood kids.  You know we had our, our clubs and we, I, I would do magic shows or have what we called penny fairs.  Where we'd, you know, do carnival kinds of activities in the backyard.  So just a great childhood growing up.  Great neighbors and, and it was much, much safer then.  So we could go out and, and be out all day without our parents worrying about where we were.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 40184
Speaker 1: Now, now where, where did you start school?
Speaker 2: So I went to public schools my whole life.  Went to 39th Street School [Los Angeles, California] which is now the Tom Bradley Elementary School.  And then went to Audubon Junior High School, which when I attended again was, was maybe one third Asian, one third Black, and one third Anglo.  And now is, is predominantly Latino and, and black.  And then I was bused in a voluntary busing program in the late '60s [1960's], to a predominantly white high school on the west side of L.A. called University High, named after UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles] cause it's not far from UCLA.  And a very good public high school.  And I'll never forget when I went there, there were maybe thirty black students out of 3,000 student body.  When I graduated there were maybe seventy-five.  So we were still a very small minority.  And had a good experiences, all the way through my public education.  One, one story I would like to share.  My sixth grade teacher at 39th Street School was the first African American teacher I had and, and it happened to be the first male teacher I'd ever had.  His name was Fritz Goode [ph.], whom I'm still in touch with.  And Fritz Goode told me at one point--we had a project coming up, I think it was a science project.  And Mr. Goode told me that, yeah it's G-O-O-D-E, that I could be whatever I wanted to be.  And it sounds so simple, but that message stuck with me and I'm sure was part of what allowed me to think okay, I, I can do whatever I want to do with my life and be whatever I want to be.  And ironically Fritz is, is one of the pioneers here in Hollywood as, as an African American producer, director, camera person.  And so we have been able to cross paths and, and do things together over the years.  And he was very young at the time.  So he's still very active.  But he had a lasting influence and had as I said, great experiences all the way through high school.  One negative experience that, that has stayed with me is I was on the track team in high school.  And at Uni High, which is the nickname for University [High School], I was very, very comfortable.  Even though we, the black kids were in the minority, it was a very progressive school.  You know the parents of the kids who went there were very accepting of their kids' relationships with the black kids who went to school there.  So never had any negative experiences until literally I think it was April 4th, 1968.  I was on the track team and, and I was practicing.  And a white--I'll never forget, a pudgy, white kid comes gleefully skipping across the field saying they shot that son of a bitch Martin Luther King.  They killed Martin Luther King.  And he, he was celebrating.  And I'll never forget the feeling of being kicked in the stomach because I had been unaware that kids with that kind of attitude even went to that high school.  And here this kid, you know, one the news was devastating enough.  But then the fact that this kid was celebrating it obviously changed my feeling about, about the school and, and my experience there forever.  I do think he was in the, the vast minority at the school.  But I, I also remember thinking what kind of household does he grow up in to, to have absorbed that kind of hatred from his parents?  But he was, he was celebrating the fact that Martin Luther King had been shot.
Story_ID: 40185
Speaker 1: How, how were racial relations in, in Los Angeles [California] as in general?
Speaker 2: In, in retrospect, Los Angeles has always been one of the most segregated cities in the nation, while it has this image of being incredibly integrated.  At the time though, my experience was very, very integrated.  Again because my junior high was so mixed.  I had white friends and, and Asian friends growing up.  And always felt as comfortable in their homes as I did in any of my black friends' homes.  So my experience personally was, was very sheltered I, I guess would be the best word.  In that we were aware of it, but it was never in our faces, you know.  And so we were comfortable in the black world and for me personally especially in high school, comfortable you know, crossing those lines and having friends in, in all those universes.  So I, I think my experience was probably somewhat rare, but for me it, it was all positive.
Speaker 1: Now I guess, what were you about thirteen [years old] when the riots of '65 [1965].
Speaker 2: '65 [1965].  Yeah I was twelve or thirteen.  The--my, my biggest memory of, of '65 [1965] was my junior high school Audubon Junior High School which is on Martin Luther King Drive, literally was a staging ground for the National Guard.  And so I'll never forget our playground being filled with tanks and there was a submachine gun nest up on the roof of the junior high school.  And you know as, as a kid, or even as an adult, that's a rather startling thing to see basically an invasion of the [U.S.] Army in your junior high school.  And that, that's my most vivid memory of, of '65 [1965].  Other than that, you know, I don't remember too much in terms of negativity, other than you know, what we would hear on the news.  And, and neighborhoods being burned down, ironically not far from where we are now.  Especially 103rd Street in Watts.  And a lot of frustration on the part of the community cause obviously it was the result of police brutality and, and the LAPD [Los Angeles Police Department] historically have, have been you know notorious for being very antagonistic to the African American community.  I think that that's changed now.  But only in the last ten years or so.
Story_ID: 40186
Speaker 1: Okay, now we were talking and I think before we closed out about the reputation of the LAPD [Los Angeles Police Department; Los Angeles, California] in terms of the black community and what, was it a--did you know it was a kind of a bad--they had kind of a bad reputation when you were coming along?
Speaker 2: You know it's so interesting.  Yes I was aware of it but I fortunately never had any personal experience with it.  And another life lesson in hindsight.  When I was in high school going to this high school [University High School] on the west side of town, which was, you know, maybe twenty miles away from where I was living, I had a lot of white friends that I would go hang out with on weekends or, or at night.  And my parents [Frances Willard Smith Cloud and Hamilton Strawbridge Cloud] gave me a curfew of 1:00 a.m. and I never made it.  I never made it back by 1:00 a.m.  But I, I was not aware at the time that they weren't afraid or concerned about what I was doing cause they trusted me and my friends and knew that we were generally a responsible bunch.  They were scared to death that coming home at 1:00 a.m. I would get pulled over by LAPD.  And I had a big 'fro [afro] and generally wore Army fatigues and you know could have been branded as a hippie or a radical or, or something.  And they were scared to death of what would happen to me, especially in Brentwood or the Palisades or the area where most of my friends were cause of where my high school was, that black kid at 1:00 a.m. in that part of town, you know, was a recipe for disaster.  I never, they never shared that with me at the time.  I was never aware of it and fortunately, I never had any run-ins myself.  So in hindsight I feel very, very lucky that, that I didn't.  Cause now I see it through their eyes and I realize it could have been very problematic.  I have friends though, who did have run-ins.  Not on the west side of town, usually in the Crenshaw area or on the south side of town where the police lived up to their reputation where, you know, they would just pull you out of the car and if you gave them any talk back, you know that was their excuse.  So yeah, LAPD was, was pretty bad.  And, and finally led to the, the you know the boiling over of that frustration in '65 [1965] and then again in the Rodney King riots or resurrection, that people were just so fed up and frustrated with being treated the way that they were by public servants.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Malcolm X's first big national spotlight came when he highlighted the police brutality in LA, here in Los Angeles in the movement.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: With the picture of the brother that had been beaten.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 40187
Speaker 1: In terms of popular culture you know, youth growing up in those days in the '60s [1960s] you know, looked in New York [New York] and Los Angeles [California] for you know the role models, you know American Bandstand was produced out here and the sounds on the radio were coming out--well Detroit too on some of them.  But what was your, I guess consumption of popular culture around your household?  I mean was there a lot of television, radio, music.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My parents [Frances Willard Smith Cloud and Hamilton Strawbridge Cloud] did not let us watch that much television.  And my mom loved PBS, she was a big Julia Child fan.  And so we were an early adapter of that technology.  I'll never forget the, the early antennas that you had to have to pick up UHF [ultra high frequency] stations.  And so we, we watched a lot of PBS and not a lot of television.  Though my mom would take me out to--whenever she noticed a film shoot around Los Angeles, which there were a lot of, you know, because a lot of shows were shot on location on the streets of LA, she would come home and grab me and take me out to see a film shoot.  And so one example is they were shooting 'Mission Impossible' [TV-series] over in Exposition Park.  And--which is by the Coliseum.  And so my mom took me over there and I got to stand around and watch and ask questions.  And I remember thinking at the time that's something I'd love to do when I grow up.  So I'm sure that that had an influence.  Radio was great in those days.  I listened to both pop radio and black radio.  We had some great black radio then.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the personalities?
Speaker 2: Magnificent Montague, Wolfman Jack were great.  On the pop stations you had Sam Riddle and the Real Don Steal, KHJ was a big radio station then.  The Black stations that were great were KGFJ and KDAY, K-D-A-Y, and so much of, of life revolved around radio stations at that time.  And I, I'm sure that led to my love of radio and then my eventually working in it.  So a little bit of television you know, that I was allowed to watch so I would remember shows like 'The Man from U.N.C.L.E.' [TV-series] cause kids at school would be talking about it or obviously Ed Sullivan was a big deal cause he, he would have black acts and it was always an event you know when, there was a, a black act on Ed Sullivan.  And then when color TV happened, I remember that.  A friend of our family's that we spent a lot of time at their house, they had the first color TV in, in any of our universe.  And so we'd go there sometimes to watch 'Bonanza' on Sunday night on NBC.
Speaker 1: Cause they only broadcast certain shows in color.
Speaker 2: Yes, exactly.  Most of the shows were not in color.  But my mom had a love of culture that whenever there was an interesting article in the 'LA Times', she would point it out to me and make sure I read it.  And I'm sure that that had an influence on, on my own love of culture now and, and involvement in media and politics.
Speaker 1: Now you're talking about different from popular culture, but, but actually arts and--
Speaker 2: Well both, a mix.
Speaker 1: --history.
Speaker 2: So she would take us--I'll never forget this experience.  She took us to UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles] to see the Philharmonic and I, I'll never forget my mind being blown that that music was coming from down there.  You know it was the first time I'd seen a full orchestra.  And to, to have that experience was great.  Another landmark experience which I've told friends of mine was our parents took all three of us kicking and screaming cause we didn't want to go see this old guy perform, to see a performer that they were really excited about.  And they thought we should be exposed to him, and it was Sammy Davis, Jr.  And he did a show in the round at Pauley Pavilion at UCLA and it was at the height of his, his talent, when he was still doing everything.  When he was, he was dancing, he was playing the drums, playing the trumpet, doing the quick draw.  You know his, his imitations that he would do.  And even as kids we were blown away, and were Sammy Davis, Jr. fans the rest of our lives.  And, and I got to meet him later when I was producing the Image Awards right before he passed.  And I'll always remember seeing him in the round at UCLA where he, there's only one or two performers I've seen since then who I think even compare to what he was able to do.  Another experience just culturally, those cultural landmarks, I'll never forget we were, I was bused out to Uni [University] High [School] and on the bus the bus driver coming, either going to school or, or coming home would play the radio.  And he'd play KGFJ and I'll never forget James Brown "Say it Loud I'm Black and I'm Proud" would come on the radio and all the kids on the bus would be singing the refrain.  And, and that was very cool [laughs].  Cause here we were, you know, thirty black kids basically being bused from the Crenshaw area out to, to the white high school, and, and that was very re-, you know, reinforcing and, and inspirational, you know.  Again, not that we had a lot of negative experiences, but it, it still was great to have that solidarity amongst ourselves, the strength that that gave us.
Speaker 1: Okay that's interesting.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 40188
Speaker 1: So did any of the, now growing up in a kind of middle class neighborhood, did, did you know any of the black actors and celebrities from the neighborhood?  Did any of them live there?
Speaker 2: I don't remember--occasionally yeah, there'd be some interaction with some jazz musicians maybe.  But I don't remember any in particular being part of our experience, you know.  I'm going to feel horrible when I remember something later today.  But not really, oh, okay.  A block away from where I grew up, there was a house that was considered a mansion in our neighborhood.  Mainly because it had a vacant lot next door that was part of the house, but it, there, there was no structure on it.  It was a big grass lawn.  And we would go there to play football.  So it was, it was in a neighbor's yard.  And it--the house happened to be Ray Charles' house.  And his family lived there and he was always on the road.  And so we weren't disturbing him.  Whenever he was in town and sleeping, we, we couldn't play football.  But we would play football in his side yard because it was one of the larger houses in the neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah that, that, that's a good example.  But yeah there, there--another great story that I do remember as a child is my parents [Frances Willard Smith Cloud and Hamilton Strawbridge Cloud] and their friends were very active in the Civil Rights Movement.  And two quick stories there.  I remember as a kid you weren't quite sure of your feelings about Malcolm X, you know who, who is this guy?  Should we like him or not like him?  Is he scary, is he not scary?  And my parents never really would talk that much about him.  But I'll never forget we were coming home from church one day and the news came over the radio that he had been assassinated.  And both my parents broke into tears.  And that was the first time I realized that he was not what the media was portraying him to be.  And that was a very powerful memory.  And then also at my godmother's house up in Baldwin Hills, they had a birthday party for Martin Luther King on his last birthday, his thirty-ninth birthday.  He was happened to be in Los Angeles [California] and they threw a birthday party for him and he came and, and I remember my parents being so excited about that.  That they got to celebrate his birthday and of course none of them knew that it would be his last.
Speaker 1: Okay so you never got a chance to meet him?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I did, I did know Yolanda [King] and, and Dexter [King].  And I think I've met Marty [Martin Luther King III] too.  Yolanda and I were friends.  We got, we got to have a, a relationship you know, much later in life.  But I never got to meet Dr. King.  But my parents have a photograph of, of him on his last birthday.
Speaker 1: That, that's a good story.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and, and ironically I also got to work with and become friends with Attallah Shabazz who is Malcolm X's oldest daughter.  She worked on the Image Awards with us.  And, and I did a project with Attallah and Yolanda many years later that we, we videotaped and, and have tape of where they were doing a speaking engagement together.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 40189
Speaker 1: In school were there any, other than the, the one teacher you mentioned.
Speaker 2: Fritz Goode.
Speaker 1: Yeah Fritz Goode, were there any other teachers that were like mentors or people that took a special interest in you?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I had a, a teacher in high school [University High School, Los Angeles, California] named Fred Holtby [ph.] who was my English teacher, who was very inspirational and very encouraging, not to be afraid to write and not to be constrained by how you write.  He was great, and then I had a, another teacher named Jordan Paul who was--back then it was called "health."  He, he taught health and, and did--he was way ahead of his time with talking about interpersonal relationships, sensitivity training, you know teaching us about sex and, and all of its ramifications.  And I'm still in touch with him.  He lives in Colorado now.  And I, and I ran into Fred Holtby recently at a store, and he's retired now.  But I recognized him and went over and, and thanked him for being the influence that he, he was.  So those, those would be the, the two teachers that, that probably had the strongest impact.  I also had a, a great teacher in high school whose name I'm blanking on right now, African American female who also was an English teacher, who was really good and, and very encouraging, you know to, to follow your, your muse.
Story_ID: 40190
Speaker 1: Now did you have a--I have to ask this because of your profession, but did you have a favorite movie as a youth?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my favorite, my favorite movie was 'The Magnificent Seven'.  I was a huge Steve McQueen fan and actually got to meet Steve McQueen later in life.  Funny story there, but the 'The Magnificent Seven' for whatever reason really resonated with me.  And, and again, I hadn't thought about that until now, that it was about people who were willing to sacrifice for others, you know, people less fortunate than, than themselves.  And if I had to pick one.  And I'll never forget in college, some of my friends teased me saying well you know that's the knock-off.  You know if you're a fan of that movie, you should really be a fan of 'Seven Samurai', which I had not seen until I was in college.  And I, I see their point.  But I still love 'The Magnificent Seven' for what it was.  And, and I, you know Steven McQueen and Yul Brynner, you couldn't get any better than that.  I, I could--and, and the music of, of that, Elmer Bernstein soundtrack--can't get any better than that.
Speaker 1: Yeah I think that's played more than any other theme.
Speaker 2: Yes [laughs], yeah exactly.  That, that's an interesting question as a kid.
Story_ID: 40191
Speaker 1: All right so now when you were on the verge graduating from high school [University High School, Los Angeles, California] now, were, were you grades good?
Speaker 2: Yeah, interesting story there.  Yes.  I, I had good grades and I guess I was a natural student, and I was always in the smart classes, and never had any problems academically until I ran up against chemistry [laughs].  You know, that's when I realized oh I guess I, I won't be a doctor.  Chemistry did not work for me and, and neither did Calculus.  But yeah, did well in school and I was, I was a California kid.  I was a hippie, you know I had a fro [afro] and, and as I said you know dressed pretty radically.  I was involved in the anti-war movement.  So I grew up basically wanting to go to Stanford [University] as a California kid.  And I'll never forget my parents [Frances Willard Smith Cloud and Hamilton Strawbridge Cloud] took myself and some of my classmates on a trip up to Stanford to visit Palo Alto [California].  And I was so turned off because I felt like the school was very snooty is the, the best word I can come up with.  Very arrogant.  And I did apply and I got in but I decided not to go.  And, and so I, I wanted to go to UC [University of California] Santa Cruz because it, it sort of fit my, my politics and, and my mentality and it was a California school.  And I got into Santa Cruz on an early admission and so I was very happy and comfortable and senior year I'll never forget, was one of the best times of my life.  You know once you've been accepted to college, don't have to worry about that anymore.  And I was working at a, at a store so I was making my own money and, and you know at seventeen [years; age] you feel like you're, you know everything you need to know [laughs].  And my best friend since I was eight [years old], had gone to Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] the, the year before me.  And he would send me letters about New York and Boston [Massachusetts] and Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts] and the women's colleges up and down the East Coast.  And he came home at Christmas and he said you should apply and, and then if you get in, you can make a decision then.  So I had already been accepted at Santa Cruz and also another school I applied to was Claremont Men's College and I had been accepted there.  So I was feeling very comfortable.  I could go to Stanford, Santa Cruz or Claremont Men's College.  I was going to go to Santa Cruz and be very happy.  So my, my best friend came home at Christmas and he said why don't you just fill out an application and send it in?  And so I'll never forget, it was Christmas Day.  Went up to his house, filled out the application, got very creative with the essay questions and, and because I didn't really care, and I got in.  And I was the only kid in my school I remember to get into Yale.  And he said well, why don't you come and then if you don't like it, you can transfer back?  Now back to California.  Now I had grown up in California.  I had never seen snow fall, I had never experienced winter.  You know in California winter is, is in the 40s and 50s [degree Fahrenheit; temperature], it doesn't get any colder than that.  I, I think I had, I had been to the snow up in the mountain for weekend visits, but I'd never seen snow fall.  And so I was a little intimidated by that and being that far away from home.  But because my, my best friend was there and then his brother also applied to Yale and got in, and, and we had--they were like my surrogate brothers.  And in fact one of them is, is a nationally known guy, his name is Ron Claiborne and he's an ABC news--he anchors the weekend 'Good Morning America'.  He's the news anchor on the weekend 'Good Morning America' and he's been with ABC for a long time.  So anyway he was, he was going to go and my best friend was there, Keith Claiborne, the year before me.  So I decided--and, and then some of my friends from high school had been accepted to East Coast schools, to Bennington [College, Vermont] and Bard College [New York].  I decided to go.  And if I didn't like it, I would transfer back to Santa Cruz.  And so I, I went to Yale sight unseen.  I'd never been to New Haven.  As my dad said, he didn't know, he knew where all the bars were in New Haven, but not the school.  So I went sight unseen to Yale and ended up loving it and having four great years.
Speaker 1: Now this is 19--
Speaker 2: '70 [1970].
Speaker 1: 1970--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)
Story_ID: 40192
Speaker 1: Now did you graduate with honors or anything from high school [University High School, Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2: You know I don't remember if, I, I was probably in the top ten percentile.  But I don't remember if I got any academic honors.  One thing that surprised me is--total surprise--I was voted I think it was "Best Personality" in the, in the high school yearbook.  Some, something like that, or "Most Popular" or--one of those kinds of titles which completely took me by surprise cause I never really sort of courted that, you know or, or was aware that, that I was popular.  But it was nice [laughs].  And, and I've gone to reunions since then and, and it does seem to be true cause people you know are very, very friendly.  But no, I don't remember--and you know that was a time where we weren't really paying much attention to grades.  It was sort of not cool to pay attention to grades.  And in fact my daughter just came home with straight As and I compli--she's in middle school, and I complimented her and I said you know I, I think I only got straight As one time in my life.  And, and so I'm really impressed that you know in the seventh grade you've gotten straight As.  It's her first year in a new school.  And I, I was genuinely impressed.  So yeah, I, I knew I was "smart" but I never thought of myself as an intellectual or, or a brainiac, you know that would have been--okay.  So getting in [to Yale University] was a surprise and they did make a big deal out of it at the high school.  And, and I was a little self-conscious cause I was the only kid from my high school going cause I knew there were kids who were a lot smarter than me.  But I had been very socially active.  I was a Red Cross Youth volunteer, and that was a great program.  Again part of this, this unconscious theme of giving back, where we did fantastic things out in the community.  Whether it was performing in, in nursing homes for senior citizens.  Or I'll never forget because I was, I was, I was somewhat socially shy about dancing, for example, knowing the latest dances.  You know which was when we were growing up was a big deal.  And I wasn't the most coordinated when it came to dancing.  So as part of Red Cross Youth, we would go to dances at the Foundation for the Junior Blind and we would dance with the blind kids who couldn't see how you danced and didn't care how you danced.  They were just happy to have people there to dance.  And that helped me overcome that shyness and, and it was a great project.  They were happy, it was a great experience for us and, and--so we did those kinds of things.  We, we would go to the girls' detention center at Christmas and, and dance with them at their Christmas party.  Or as I said, senior citizens' homes.  So I was very active in the Red Cross Youth and I was on the track team and, and I was involved in theater since junior high school in, in terms of stage crew.  And I was in orchestras as a percussionist.  So I guess you know I was, I was one of those classically well rounded, interesting kids.
Speaker 1: And ran track too, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I was a pole vaulter.  Not a very good one [laughs].  I, I--you had to be--I'll never forget.  You had to be strong and fast and fairly light to be a pole vaulter because you, you know they--and I was good at everything but the actual execution.  I could--I was very strong so I could climb the rope upside down which is one of the exercises that you, you train.  I was fast and you know I, I understood everything about it.  But the idea of running at this hole in the ground with a pole that you know, running full speed at this hole in the ground and then planting and going over the bar.  So I was good at every aspect of it but, but that.  So I was never any kind of championship pole vaulter, but I was on the pole, on the track team and I ran 6/60, which is a, a lap and a half, which was great, great training.  Saw our track at the last reunion I went to and thanked him for you know, for his impact on, on my life.  Just again, he was one of those people who let you know that you could do whatever you set your mind to, you know.  And, and by the way, our track team was the LA City Champions one of the years I was there.  I, I did not contribute to that championship but you know I was in some good company.  And, and our coach obviously was really good.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 40193
Speaker 1: So now Yale [University], the fall of 1970.  Now what was going on in New Haven, Connecticut?
Speaker 2: Yeah great time.  The Black Panthers were active in New Haven.  Lot of anti-war efforts going on.  I was part of all of those things.  Big Panther trial was going on in, in 1970, '71 [1971].
Speaker 1: In New Haven.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean we interviewed Hugh Price I think.
Speaker 2: I know.
Speaker 1: Was he, was he there then?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  I think he was just getting ready to leave.
Speaker 1: Yeah I think he worked for a community center.
Speaker 2: Yeah exactly.
Speaker 1: And he was in graduate school or something.
Speaker 2: Right, and we did meet then.  Yeah, great time to be there.  Yale was very, very progressive, Kingman Brewster was the president and, and so the anti-war effort you know I remember going out and demonstrating when General Westmoreland came to campus and wearing a hard hat to the demonstrations and, and then going down to the City Hall when the Panthers were on trial.  The--great time to be there, very interesting adjustment for me because in high school [University High School, Los Angeles, California] most of my friends had been women.  And so now I'm going to this really super macho male institution which had just admitted women the year before, but the ratio was four to one.  And so it was, it was a big adjustment.  And the women lived off in their own dorm and, and it was sort of like a fortress.  And so it was very hard to get to know a lot of the Yale women, especially as a freshman.  And so I was injected into this super male atmosphere, had some great roommates who you know are friends for life.  And yet being a, a hippie kid from the West Coast going to you know this Ivy League East Coast college, was a bit of an adjustment.  And, and I had some, you know some rocky times.  I'll never forget one of my professors who was a Yates Scholar in one of my English classes, and I'll give you the quote, "Mr. Cloud I find your colloquial style amusing, but I don't know how to grade it."  And, and I remember being slapped by that because you know, up until that time I had always been encouraged to write.  But this guy you know, was used to the, the five page paper.  And I didn't know how to write the five page paper.  And I wrote like I spoke.  So he didn't know how to grade it.
Speaker 1: Did you have a partic--was there a particular California way of speaking then as opposed to New Haven?
Speaker 2: Probably a lot looser and probably not as formal.  Especially in writing style, you know.  There is a prep school style of writing the five page paper that I had never learned.  And so you know as he said, he didn't know how to grade what I was writing.  But later in life I, I learned that there was value to that, especially in radio and television.  So yeah a great time to be there.  You know culturally and musically, things were exploding.  You know I'll never forget being on campus on Fridays and, and people would be blasting Santana out of their, you know their dorm rooms and, and all that great music.  And I, I, I can't even remember why, but one of my roommates and I went to the training program at the college radio station.  And that was when you know literally I was bitten by the bug and I said oh, this is what I want to do.
Story_ID: 40194
Speaker 1: Yeah we were talking about some of the people that were there, Skip Gates [also a HistoryMaker]--
Speaker 2: Yeah so when I was at Yale [University], Skip Gates was a year or two ahead of me.  Henry Louis Gates.  Let's see, Warrington Hudlin, who is a filmmaker and Reggie Hudlin's older brother was one of my classmates.  Ron Claiborne I mentioned.  Goodness, a, a lot of great folks were there.  You know around the same time.  Over at the drama school though, I, I never met them, but Charles Dutton and Angela Bassett were over at the drama school.
Story_ID: 40195
Speaker 1: My favorite professor is still there [Yale University], a gentleman by the name of Willie Ruff who you guys should interview cause he's, he's a treasure trove.  He--yeah he's fantastic, music professor and jazz musician.  Spends half the year teaching at Yale and the other half traveling the world as a jazz musician.  And he exposed us to so many things.  I, I literally got to, to meet Duke Ellington and I hosted a radio broadcast of a concert that Willie Ruff organized with Ellington and his orchestra.  He, he funded the Ellington Fellowship at Yale, and that was the kickoff of that and I actually hosted the radio broadcast of it.  Just brought through Honi Coles and B.B. King and, and, and just incredible folks that you know, I was exposed to while I was there.  And, and yeah, great time, great time to, to be there.  And so I, I fell in love with radio.  I walked in the radio station and it was like the lightning bolt.  I knew that's what I wanted to do and ended up--Yale had a commercial FM license.  And so we broadcast to all of New Haven [Connecticut], and it was a very rare for a college radio station to have a commercial license.  And so we could sell commercials and support the radio station that way.  And we weren't paid but we were able to you know keep the electricity on and, and all of that.  So the university didn't pay for the radio station, it was self supporting.  So we had a program called 'Black Spectrum' that was on the air five hours a day and then most of the weekends.  I forget what the total number of hours were per week.  And I became the program director of Black Spectrum and it was the number one radio station in New Haven at, at the time.  Because New Haven had this sizable African American population that didn't have its, its own radio.  So we became that and before Black Spectrum there was a, a, a group of pioneering folks who did a program called 'Soul Sessions'.  And they created that programming in the '60s [1960s] and then we carried forward with Black Spectrum and we were so far ahead of our time in terms of mixing genres of, of black music and, and Latin music.  Because back then you know, you couldn't mix R&B [rhythm and blues] with jazz or gospel or Latin.  But that's what we did.  And--
Speaker 2: I've always found that curious that, that black people will, will you know--
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, well--
Speaker 2: --well that's not you know--
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: R&B was all you heard on most of the black radio stations around the country.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And that was it and if you put jazz or anything else on it--
Speaker 1: Which, that always struck me as very strange too because it, it all comes from the same roots.  And you know I suppose there are purists, but we created a format where we did mix all the music and it worked.  And we were really proud, and we were following the lead of WHUR in, in Washington, D.C. [District of Columbia] which is again, a very pioneering--
Speaker 2: I was going to mention them as that's the only other station I've heard that mixed the genres like that.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: WHUR.
Speaker 1: And, and we were following their lead.  And I got to meet Tony Brown and, and, and go to some conferences in D.C. and, and we were really inspired by what they did.  And so we did this programming in New Haven that people still remember and, and you know I, I've met and heard from people who you know, still remember the programming that we did and, and the show, Black Spectrum, lived on for many years.
Speaker 2: Did you intersperse some political content as well?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Like Malcolm's [Malcolm X] speeches and Dr. [Martin Luther] King.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, yes.  That's exactly what we did.  So we would play snippets of King and of Malcolm and there was a great album called "Guess Who's Coming Home?" about black fighting men in Vietnam [war] that we would pull snippets out of that.  I'm glad you mentioned that cause again, that's what WHUR was doing.  And so we--it was, it was really culturally rich and sophisticated and, and musically, and we were very, very proud of it.
Story_ID: 40196
Speaker 1: And it [Yale University's radio station] became a, a, a real potent force in New Haven [Connecticut] because we worked with the Panthers' [Black Panthers] party quite a bit, and with the, the local black community on Dixwell Avenue in New Haven.  There was a great black owned record store called The B&L Record Shop.  And you know it became a, a cultural center and it was such a rich time because the great thing about college radio is the industry tends to pigeon-hole people.  You know they decide you're either this or you're that.  You know you're a writer or a director, you're comedy or you're drama or whatever.  In college radio you could do whatever you wanted to do.  And so you could do news, you could do music, you could do cultural affairs.  So yeah we would have local community leaders on and, and talk about things.  And, and the radio station literally became a, a cultural focal point of New Haven because there wasn't that much to do in New Haven.  And so people would come by the station and we became mentors to high school kids.  And it, it was fantastic learning experience for me and, and as I say, it, it lived on and still lives on.  And the radio station is still doing really well.
Story_ID: 40197
Speaker 1: That radio job [at Yale University's station, WYBC] led me to a mainstream radio job in New Haven [Connecticut].  And one of my life mentors, a gentleman named Fred Walker, owned and, and operated a radio station called WELI which everyone always thought Yale owned it cause Eli is the Yale nickname.  But WELI was the powerhouse radio station in the market.  You know morning drive it had 50 shares, meaning 50 percent of the people in New Haven were listening to that radio station.
Speaker 2: Now what was the name of the--
Speaker 1: WYBC.
Speaker 2: WYBC.
Speaker 1: Which stands for Yale Broadcasting Company, and it's still on the air, WYBC.  And so that led to WELI and again, Fred Walker and his folks were so supportive and accommodating.  So I was working there twenty hours a week doing public affairs and production.  And, and weekend announcing and, and things like that and they let me do whatever I wanted to do, which was fantastic.  And ironically, cause all these things tie together, when I was working at WELI, a young guy who had graduated from Yale was the promotions director for a local television station in New Haven, WTNH.  And so he would come out to WELI to produce the radio commercials for his television station because they, they would advertise the television station's afternoon movie or, or evening news or whatever on the radio station.  And so this guy would come out and produce the spots and, and I was the production manager, so I would work with him.  And he he liked me and I liked him and, and he loved the fact that I could create whatever his imagination came up with and he was very, very creative.  So five years later and I, I know I'm jumping ahead here, but I had moved to the West Coast and he had moved to Chicago [Illinois] and moved to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] and was working at NBC, and he got a promotion at NBC and I read it in the trades and I wrote him a congratulatory note and sent it to him.  And his name is, was Brandon Tartikoff.  And Brandon was one of my mentors and, and life influences, and I'm so sad that he's not with us anymore.  But he hired me at NBC and, and brought me over there.
Story_ID: 40198
Speaker 1: Now did you start at K, KABC?
Speaker 2: Yes, okay.  So and, and by the way, my junior year of college [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] I was working at three radio stations, WELI, WYBC and a station in Bridgeport [Connecticut] called WEZN, which is a beautiful music station.  And I was having so much fun that that was my focus and I knew that if I tried to do that and school, that school would take second place and I'd run the risk of flunking out.  And so I took the first semester of my junior year off and you know that, that was very common in those times you know, take a year off or whatever.  And in hindsight, I really appreciate how supportive my parents [Frances Willard Smith Cloud and Hamilton Strawbridge Cloud] were that they--I called and explained to them what I was going to do and why I wanted to do it and they didn't freak out and they were accepting.  And they said okay.  And you know even though I was middle class growing up, my dad as a dentist, I found out later, he, he was much more interested in the artistry of dentistry than he was in the money part of it.  He was a dentist's dentist in that a lot of the other black dentists would come to him as patients because he was a, a real artist with it.  You know, the skills that you need as a dentist, as a sculptor, etc., my dad was great at.  And so he never was in it for the money.  And so I found out much later in life compared to other dentists and doctors, my dad did not make a lot of money.  And I'll never forget seeing my parents' confidential statement.  You know when you're applying to college and you're applying for, for loans and, and scholarships, your, your parents fill out a PCS, a Parents' Confidential Statement.  And I'll never forget realizing that my dad didn't make a lot of money, made $15,000 a year as I remember when I was a freshman in college.  And I remember consciously saying after my freshman year I don't want my father to contribute any more to my education, cause I have two younger sisters who he's going to have to try to figure out how to pay for their college education.  So after my freshman year, my dad did not contribute towards my college education.  And fortunately Yale and I think most other Ivy colleges, once they accept you, they accept you without regard to financial matters.  They help you figure out how to pay for it.  And so through a, a, a combination of loans and scholarships and working, whether it was campus jobs or, or outside jobs, I was able to pay for my education after freshman year.  Which is, is something I'll always be appreciative of at Yale.  Didn't cost nearly what it costs today.  When I graduated, my entire debt was $4,000 [laughs] which, you know today the burden that, that students graduate--
Speaker 1: [Unclear]
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly.  The burdens that they graduate with are, are very rare, I mean are, are huge.  So okay so I, I was working at the three radio stations.  I took the semester off.  Some bell went off inside my head that said you, you found what you love, but the degree is going to be worth it.  So go back and finish.  And that didn't come from my dad, or my parents.  It--something inside my head said that.  And, and I'm sure they, they had probably ingrained it in me, but I knew I needed to finish.  So I dropped one of the three radio stations and went back and was able to, to finish and graduate.
Story_ID: 40199
Speaker 1: So when I finished [at Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut], the, the gentleman Fred Walker who owned WELI [radio station in New Haven] offered me a job in New Orleans [Louisiana].  I also had a job offer in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], and Fred Walker had introduced me to an old friend of his who was the general manager at KFWV radio in Los Angeles [LA, California], which was a Westinghouse owned and operated station.  I, I was reluctant to return to LA because I, I had this fear that I would get stuck in LA.  I wanted to bounce around the country before I came back.  But the stations for me creatively and every other way, was LA.  And so I did, I worked the summer before I graduated at KFWB, and I loved it.  And so, and I also worked on the weekends at a black owned radio station, which no longer exists, called KAGB, and I was, I was living and breathing radio and I loved it and so when I finished I moved back to LA and I worked at KFWB.  They had a, a Westinghouse management training program, which I went through and, and worked full time at KFWB and then I worked on the weekends at KAGB, and, and I also taught at Los Angeles City College.  I taught broadcasting courses at LACC [Los Angeles City College], and I was barely older than the students, obviously, cause I had just graduated.  But I really enjoyed that.  So I was, I was working you know--I've always had multiple jobs.  I was working at the two radio stations and, and teaching.  And then a, a friend--
Speaker 2: So this was like 1970--
Speaker 1: '75 [1975].
Speaker 2: '75 [1975], okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So a friend asked me if I would ever be interested in television, and I actually wasn't, cause I love radio.  And I, and I've always felt for the black community radio was a much more powerful medium.  But I was offered this job at KABC and I decided to make the jump because it was doing children's and public affairs programming.  And I had a great experience there, and did a live Sunday morning children's show that was sort of a children's version of, of 'Good Morning America', which was ahead of its time.  And, and I loved doing that.  And the public affairs programming, you know I'd literally--I was producing talk shows, and got to work with a, a gentleman named Tommy Hawkins who was a LA Laker [basketball] player and, and later became a broadcaster and still does radio here in LA on, on the jazz station.  And used to work for the, the Dodgers.  But I got to produce a show with Tommy Hawkins and do this children's programming.
Story_ID: 40200
Speaker 1: And so I was working at Channel 7 when Brandon Tartikoff was given his promotion and, and so he hired me away from KABC to go to NBC.  And NBC was a great experience.  I was there for six years.  I, and again I went there not being a huge fan of television, cause I hadn't watched it for most of college and hadn't watched it that much since moving back because I was doing so, so much radio.  And I generally had a negative opinion of television.  But Brandon offered me a job in the TV movie department.  And that was something I could relate to, and enjoyed that format.  And NBC had a, a--also a management training program.  And the reason I mention that is, is you know the great debate about affirmative action.  Literally you know if those, if Fred Walker had not taken his own personal affirmative action of wanting to identify you know, a sharp person of color to bring into the company, that wouldn't have happened.  If Westinghouse didn't have their management training program, that wouldn't have happened, and if NBC didn't have their program, that would not have happened.  And so you know I, I definitely am a, a fan and believer in affirmative action programs because I do know the reality that those doors don't open themselves.  So, so I, I got to go to NBC, do TV movies, go to work on some fantastic projects from 'Back Stairs at the White House', to 'Centennial' to my favorite of them all was 'Shogun'.  Actually got to go to Japan during the production of 'Shogun'.  And that was an incredible experience.
Speaker 2: Yeah it starred Richard Chamberlain.
Speaker 1: Yes, great story there.
Speaker 2: It was popular in the black community.  I remember guys talking about it.
Speaker 1: Well I'll never forget another life experience.  The first night of 'Shogun', I went home and I was living in an apartment building and I wanted to watch it, obviously I'd seen it many, many times.  But I wanted to watch it like the rest of America was going to see it.  And so I, I remember going home and turning on the television, and I got a phone call and so I turned down the volume and I could hear 'Shogun' coming from all the apartments around me.  And I knew oh my gosh, it's going to be a hit.  You know because we had no idea.  NBC was in a distant third place, Fred Silverman was scared to death that 'Shogun' was going to be a disaster because so much of it was in Japanese, and it was twelve hours.  It was the most expensive television show up to that point.  And, and everyone was very nervous about it.  But that night I knew it was going to be a hit.
Speaker 2: Now what, what was your role in the production of 'Shogun'?
Speaker 1: Okay I was what they call a development executive.  It, it was bought and developed before I got there, but when I went into the movie department, my boss, a great woman named Deanne Barkley, put me--she assigned me to the project to, to read the script and give her my thoughts, to view some of the audition tapes of the actors as they were auditioning and give her my thoughts, and then to watch dailies, which are everyday the film that is shot the day before is sent to the network to look at for us to catch any problems or, or try to see any issues that are coming up so that they can be corrected while they're still in production.  So I watched all the dailies on, on 'Shogun' and gave notes.  As I said, I went to Japan during the production.  It was a yearlong shoot.  And Richard Chamberlain was not the first choice for the role.  But in hindsight, he was the most fantastic choice for the role because Sean Connery who probably would have done a great job, passed on it because it was going to take a year to shoot.  And for television movie for a movie start, that was, that was not a good use of his time.  So he passed on it for that reason.  And then it was offered to a bunch of television actors who I won't name, but they would not have been as good as Richard Chamberlain.  And in, in hindsight you go oh, thank goodness cause Richard Chamberlain was fantastic.  And, and you know went on to become one of the, the major stars of mini-series in, in television history.  But 'Shogun' was a very interesting gamble because the, the way the writer wrote the script was that the audience would learn Japanese along with the lead character, Blackthorn who was Richard Chamberlain's character.  And part of the dramatic suspense was not knowing what they were talking about and always having the fear that literally he might get his head cut off if he said the wrong thing or stepped on the wrong toes.  And so the fact that there was so much Japanese freaked out the, the management and the compromise that was worked out was some of it was subtitled.  But the, the point was that we would learn enough Japanese through Blackthorn to by, by the middle of the mini-series you'd have some feel for what's going on, but you'd still be in the dark and not really knowing what was going on.  So it was a great cultural experience for me.  And as I said I got to go to Japan, and that was another great experience, both watching the production, but just being exposed to Japanese culture.  And I ended up marrying a woman from Japan.  So--
Speaker 2: Did you meet her on the--
Speaker 1: No, I, I actually met her years later in, in Los Angeles [California].  But that exposure to Japanese culture I'm sure had an impact.
Story_ID: 40201
Speaker 1: Now how did the Japanese community here in America react to that ['television mini-series, 'Shogun']?
Speaker 2: They, they were proud of it and, and even though it was you know, told from the Anglo's perspective, I think that they were--it was such positive exposure to Japanese culture I think, real Japanese culture as opposed to World War II propaganda Japanese culture that--I think that they were happy about it.
Story_ID: 40202
Speaker 1: Another project that, that I want to mention that, that I'm really proud of still was one that I developed literally from the ground up, which was called 'Grambling's White Tiger'.  Which was a true story of the first white guy to play football at Grambling [State University, Grambling, Louisiana].  And NBC had on its books a deal with Bruce Jenner who had won the decathlon in the 1977 Olympics and they wanted him to be an announcer at the 1980 Olympics.  And so they made this talent deal with him, and part of it included doing a TV movie that he could act in.  And Brandon [Tartikoff] said to me Hamilton, what are we going to come up with for this guy who's not an actor to, to star in?  You know we've got to come up with a project.  So Bruce's manager had done some work with Grambling helping syndicate Grambling's college football games.  And so he had a relationship with Grambling and Eddie, Coach Eddie Robinson.  And he found this book that was the true story of this guy who went to Grambling and, and was the third string quarterback.  And Brandon thought that that would make a great movie.  And so he assigned me to the project, and I, I really thought it was important that if at all possible we have a black writer and a black director.  And if at all possible, shoot it on location because I knew that to understand the culture of a black college, you know, you had to know something about that universe, and if possible we had to shoot it there.  Well I was able to massage all those pieces into place and we had a, a, a black/white writing team who wrote the script.  I got George Sanford Brown who was the actor from the 'Rookies' to direct it, cause he had become a director.  I was really proud of the fact that I got Harry Belafonte to play Coach Eddie Robinson.  It was the first TV movie he had ever done.  And, and so I was really proud of that.  And I still have a relationship with, what Mr. Belafonte.  And LeVar Burton who was, was still very--this was 1979, so LeVar was still very hot from 'Roots' to play the best friend.  So we had Bruce Jenner, Harry Belafonte and LeVar Burton.  And we shot it at Grambling and it did really well that it was one of the few television movies that ran more than twice on the network.  Because Brandon understood that it was a reverse integration story.  And so he would promote it in his football games, and the, the football audience was interested.  Cause they, you know it was about football and they knew who Bruce Jenner was, and so they came.  And the black audience you know, came.  And so it did really well in the ratings and, and Brandon aired it I think three times.  And to this day people say oh, I remember that movie.  You know I saw that movie.  And it, it really was groundbreaking in, in a lot of ways because of--Scoey Mitchell was one of the producers on it.  Dennis Haysbert was in the cast.  You know long before anybody knew--he played a college student.  And it was great, it was just a great project that I'm still very proud of.
Speaker 2: I remember that.
Speaker 1: Oh, good.
Story_ID: 40203
Speaker 1: In 1982, I guess you, you, you took another job at ABC.
Speaker 2: Yes.  So I had received some job offers to, to leave NBC [in Los Angeles, California] and go to work for MGM [Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer] and there was another offer I can't remember.  And Brandon [Tartikoff] said don't leave, I want you to stick around, I like having you as part of the team.  I'll make it worth your while.  And so I said okay.  And he had been my mentor and still was, so you know I trusted him.  And by the way, at NBC a couple other quick stories that I was really proud of.  Brandon, one he made it fun, and two he welcomed ideas from anywhere, you know.  He said if it's not fun, why are we doing it?  And so in our weekly meetings anybody could contribute whatever idea that they might have.  So there was always an open door.  And I had developed a relationship with Stevie Wonder through another project that I was doing with him that I'm really proud of also, about the King Holiday.  And so I went to Brandon and I said what would you think of Stevie Wonder hosting 'Saturday Night Live'?  And at that point, I, I don't think they'd even had a black host yet, or very few.  And Brandon said do you think you can make that happen?  And I said yeah.  And so he picks up the phone, calls Lauren Michaels and says what do you think?  Stevie Wonder.  And Lauren Michaels says yeah.  And so that's how Stevie ended up hosting Saturday Night Live.
Speaker 1: Now this is the era when Eddie Murphy was the hottest--
Speaker 2: Yeah, now actually that was before, before Eddie was in the cast.  So I think it was before Eddie.
Speaker 1: I know this image in my mind of Eddie--
Speaker 2: Doing Stevie.  You know what?  You may be right, you may be right.  Yeah, but it, but it was still fairly early in Eddie's run.  Yeah I think you're right.  That Eddie did his Stevie imitation.
Speaker 1: Eddie kind [unclear].
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right, that's right, yes.  So anyway that happened.  I also set up a simulcast of, of a, a radio simulcast of the Motown 25 repeat when they did that special.  So I was, I was very proud of that.  And I, I got to do a lot of things at NBC because of Brandon.  Including--so he said I'll make it worth your while to stick around.  And so an opening came up to be vice president of what they call Current Comedy, which is supervising the sitcoms that are already on the air, that are bought.  And by supervising, most sitcoms take a week to shoot.  And so the network is involved in the, in the story ideas, the guest casting, the writing of the script, the hiring of the writers, the hiring of the directors.  Then when the scripts are written, we give notes.  The decisions as to which scripts are going to get shot, how they're going to be promoted, how they're aired.  And so over the course of the week of production, the executive would go to a table reading and give notes of the, of the script which is at the beginning of the week.  Then a mid-week run-through and then the taping of the show.  So I had six sitcoms that I was directly charge of, and then I had one other guy that worked with me and he had the other six sitcoms.  When we started there were only six of them, and we grew to twelve.  But I did that for two years and I was there at a great time because in hindsight, NBC was in a distant third place.  Cause this was before 'The Cosby Show'.  And so we were doing what we thought were good shows, but nobody was watching them because there was nothing to promote them in.  So for example I was the exec on the first two years of 'Cheers', the first two years of 'Family Ties', the last year of 'Taxi', 'Give Me a Break' with Nell Carter, goodness what else?  Some other good shows.  And again, I was so fortunate because Brandon thought that I had the, the people skills and, and certainly the, the production and television knowledge that even though I had not been a fan of sitcoms and didn't really watch that many of them, he trusted me to be able to learn about them and during the course of that two years, I developed a whole 'nother appreciation for what comedies are and how hard it is to make them.
Story_ID: 40204
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay. So, we're talking about the NBC comedy line-up in what, the early '80s (1980s).  Now, this was a fairly popular set of shows as I remember; 'Cheers' especially and 'Family Ties'--
Speaker 2: But what was so interesting--yeah.  What was so interesting was that the shows were really good, but nobody was watching NBC.  And so, NBC was in third, and this is, you know, before Fox happened.  So, NBC was in third place.  And so, Cheers and Family Ties were struggling.  But Brandon [Tartikoff] believed in them and stuck with them, and they were very good obviously.  But right after I left, they bought 'The Cosby Show'.  And when the Cosby Show took off like a rocket, they built Thursday-Night-Must-See-T.V.  And they were able to promote Family Ties and A Different World and Cheers, and that became their Thursday night juggernaut.  And I love seeing the reruns of Cheers and Family Ties because when you see shows from the first two years, they're as good as any of the rest of the shows, but nobody was watching them, you know, comparatively.  But that--and I think that that has actually helped them in syndication because for viewers it's almost like fresh material because they may not have come to the show until the third or fourth year.  So that was a great experience in that I've gained a whole new respect for the people who are able to do that kind of creativity under that kind of time pressure, you know, to literally be able to turn out those gems in five days is pretty amazing.  And--
Speaker 1: Are they all being shot in NBC studios here in L.A. [Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2: No.  They were shot in different places.  Another show I worked on by the way was Mama's Family, which was shot over at CBS, and getting to work with Vicky Lawrence and Carol Burnett's husband, Joe Hamilton, and Harvey Korman, and people like that was great too.  And I learned from them, you know, that it didn't have to be rocket science; that you could do something that resonated with America that might seem broad and silly, but the people watching the show could relate to those characters and so it worked.  So they were being shot all over town.  'Cheers' was at Paramount; 'Taxi' was at Paramount; 'Night Court' was at Paramount; 'Give Me A Break' was over in Norman Lear's shop, which doesn't exist anymore, it's a high school; and Nell Carter was fantastic to work with.  And 'Mama's Family' was at CBS, and--
Speaker 1: This was an NBC show but it was shot at CBS?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yeah, because they all had studios that they rent out.  And so, Vicky Lawrence and them, they wanted to shoot it on the old Carol Burnett stage where they had done the Burnett Show all those years, and so, that's why they did it at CBS.
Story_ID: 40205
Speaker 1: So, yeah, I was driving all over town and working six days a week.  And I remember after the two years I was burned out.  And as much as I was loving it, I was exhausted.
Speaker 2: Couldn't they have solved the problem by hiring more staff or what?
Speaker 1: Yeah, they could have.  But at the time they felt that the two of us doing the six shows--I mean the twelve shows, in hindsight, yeah, we should have said, "Brandon, we need help," [Brandon Tartikoff] and they could have solved it that way, but they didn't.  So, you mentioned that 'Saturday Night Live' was in trouble because Eddie was going to leave, and they had been trouble before Eddie Murphy's ascension, and now that he was leaving they were really worried about what it was going to be.  And so, Brandon asked me if I had any ideas for Late Night.  And I said, "Yes, as a matter of fact I do."  And I had a concept that I'd developed with some friends for a late night variety show that we called 'Welcome to the Fun Zone'.  And, in hindsight, I think that Brandon used it as a way to light a fire under the producers of Saturday Night Live; not so much that they were worried about competition from me, but just the fact that he had another show in the pipeline that if they didn't make some changes that he was encouraging them to make, they could be replaced.  And so, we did our pilot and I was really proud of it; some talent that we had in the show that was way ahead of their time is--we had Carlos Santana perform.  Now he was already a star, but it was in one of the dips in his career; so I was really proud about that.  Howie Mandel was on the show, and he was only known as a dramatic actor at that time because he was on Saint Elsewhere, and he was just starting his comedy shops.  Weird Al Yankovic was one of our guests; Doctor Demento was one of our guests; and Victoria Jackson, who went on to Saturday Night Live; and I'm trying to remember.  There were some other talent in there.  But, we did the pilot.  Brandon--Saturday Night Live made the changes that he wanted.  And during the development of Welcome to the Fun Zone, I had to choose between either remaining with the network and being the executive in charge or being the producer of the show.  And so, you know, it was a choice of possibly being the next Lorne Michaels or staying the network executive.  So, I'd been at NBC for six years and I was burned out, I said, "Let me roll the dice and take this shot."  You know, I knew it was a long shot, but how often do you get a chance to possibly replace Saturday Night Live.  So we produced the pilot.  Obviously Brandon stuck with Saturday Night Live, and so, I was out of a job at NBC.  But no hard feelings, you know, because it had been a great opportunity.
Story_ID: 40206
Speaker 1: So, I left and formed a management company with--and a production company--with two other guys that I'd worked with on the 'Fun Zone' ['Welcome to the Fun Zone'].  And we managed Weird Al Yankovic and Doctor Demento, and then we went on to manage Nell Carter and John Hendricks, an incredible jazz musician and composer; and Miriam Makeba.  You know, the--
Speaker 2: The Queen of Africa (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Queen of Africa, which is a whole another story.  Let me just finish the NBC story.  So let's see.  I left in '84 (1984), so in '86 (1986), Brandon [Tartikoff], who was still at NBC, and I still had a great relationship with him, calls me up one day and he says, "You've been to the Image Awards, right?"  And I said, "Yeah.  I used to go and represent the company," because it was a dinner that had been going on for years, and I would--NBC would buy a table and I would go to represent the company.  And he said, "Do you think you could turn it into a television show?"  And I said, having been there for six years, I knew what a "fluke" and a "gift from the gods" that this was, that Brandon would say, "I want to put the Image Awards on television."  And it was only because of his own personal politics and--he said, "I think this show deserves to be on television.  Do you think you can turn it into a television show?"  And because I knew what a rarity that was without even thinking, I jumped and said, "Yes."  Now, I knew Willis Edwards and I knew that he was difficult to deal with and had a--my favorite phrase for Willis is, is a "bull in a China shop," and that he has a great heart and great instincts and--but sometimes is his own worst enemy because he will alienate people.
Speaker 2: Now, he was the head of the Los Angeles NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]?
Speaker 1: Correct.  He was president of the Beverly Hills-Hollywood [California] branch of the NAACP, who--and that branch had created the Image Awards, and Willis had been very important in its development to finally really cause it to attract Hollywood's attention, because Willis is a great promoter.  And so, I knew Willis was difficult to work with, but I thought that this opportunity was so unique that I said yes.  And I asked a few of my friends what they thought, and they all said, "Oh, my God.  Good luck.  Willis is, you know, a piece of work.  Blah, blah, blah."  But because I liked Willis, and I thought, as I said, his heart was always in the right place, I said yes to Brandon, and he said, "Okay.  Here's the catch.  I can't give you much money to do it with because I'm going to put it on at late night.  I'm going to preempt Saturday Night Live, you know, one weekend in January when they'd be in reruns anyway, and I'll put on the Image Awards.  And I can't give you much money to work with."  So again, because I knew what a unique opportunity this was, and that the stars might not align themselves and the heavens wouldn't open up like this again, I said yes.  So I jumped in, Willis and I got together.  And the business people at NBC in my opinion, thought that this was one of Brandon's crazy ideas and, "We'll give them just enough money to fail, so they'll get to do this show, but it won't do anything, and we'll say we did it and then it'll be history."  Okay, but Willis and I thought we took that as a challenge.  And so, I figured out how to do the show for a couple hundred grand more than NBC was going to give us.  And Willis and I went out and met with Jeffrey Katzenberg and some other heavyweights in town, raised some money, and then the NBC business people threw another hurdle at us.  They said, "Okay, you have to come up with a production guarantor company," which means if "Hamilton, if you go over budget, there has to be a company with deep enough pockets to cover that overage, because we're not going to pay for it.  But they have to guarantee that you'll get the show in the can, get it edited, and it will air."  And, again, they may have thought that that would kill the project.  Because at that time, you know, Brandon, being a creative wonderkin (ph.), had a lot of ideas, and they thought, because, you know, NBC was just starting to take off at that point.  They--sometimes they thought Brandon's ideas were crazy and didn't deserve to happen.  But because he was the president, you know, they couldn't say no.  So, they gave us, and again, in my opinion, just enough money to fail.  But, Willis and I raised some more money, and Willis is great at that.  Willis had sold Brandon on the idea in the first place literally in the men's restroom (laughter).  While standing at the urinal he said, "Brandon, you ought to put the Image Awards on the air."  And it resonated and Brandon said, "Yeah, you know, you're right."  And so, literally that's how it came about.
Story_ID: 40207
Speaker 1: So, I happen to know two black women who were--who I--one I had worked with at NBC, who were in business at--they were both business affairs attorneys for Johnny Carson's production company.  And so, I went to them and said, "What do you think the odds would be that your company could be our production guarantor?"  And they knew what that meant, that potentially they'd be on the hook for any overages.  And I said, "I'll, you know, I'll give you my word that I won't go over budget."  So, they took it to their management, a guy named Ed Weintrob (ph.)--Ed Weinberger (ph.), and obviously all the way up to Mr. Carson, and they said, "Yes, we would like to do this.  We will not take a fee," which most production companies would take a fee off the top.  They said, "We will not take a fee, Hamilton, but you commit that you won't go over budget."  And they told the two women, you know, to make sure I didn't go over budget.  And so, that's how the Image Awards was born.  And we literally, the first year--and I love these situations because this is what makes history so interesting.  Even with the money that Willis [Edwards; head of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) branch in Beverly Hills-Hollywood, California] had gone out and raised with the little help from me was not enough.  I guess I remember it was $625,000, which was maybe half of what we should have had to produce, you know, a ninety-minute, first-class award show.  But, when I went to, for example, the--they had a variety programmer at NBC who is still there, a guy named Rick Luglen (ph.), said, "Hamilton, I know you don't have enough money to hire anybody I've heard of, so go ahead and hire the people that you know can do the job, and I'll approve them."  And so, I hired a woman I had worked with at PFWB named Rita Cash, who I knew was a great writer and knew everything there was to know about African American culture and, you know, could write the show with some poetry, you know.  And I found a set that was in a theatre that was being used for a series of jazz shows, and it was a really nice set and I'd--because I had gone to one of the concerts and seen it, and I went to the producer of the jazz series and I said, "Let me buy your set.  You know, instead of you paying to tear it down and cart it away, let me buy it from you, and I'll pay to--."  And so, he sold me the set for a dollar.  And, so the first year with much less money than we should have had, we did this show that looked like a million bucks, and with writing that was so good it got a Writer's Guild nomination that year for variety show writing.  The celebrities supported it, and we even got critical raves from Todd Shields and the 'Washington Post' and other T.V. critics.  We surprised everybody.  The show was great; it had heart and soul and emotion.  And what I was most proud of is--in our goal for the fourteen years that I did the Image Awards was we made black folks look great; that it was a chance for us to honor each other in front of the rest of the country and look--sound intelligent, look good, have fun, you know.  So we would always capture what we called the heart and the soul in that our goal was to try to honor each other in a way that nobody else would think of doing.  And I think we were successful at that.  And so, that's how the Image Awards were born.
Speaker 2: Now--
Speaker 1: Yes?
Speaker 2: --what year was that when you started?
Speaker 1: 1986.
Speaker 2: 1986.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Yep.
Story_ID: 40208
Speaker 1: And so, Willis [Edwards; head of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) branch in Beverly Hills-Hollywood, California] and the Beverly Hills-Hollywood branch, they would come up with the ideas of who they wanted to honor, and they would come up with great ideas, whether it was Ella Fitzgerald or--one year we did a tribute to the Temps [Temptations], Tops, O'Jays, and Dells.  And, you know, they'd come up with the great ideas, we would turn it into what I think was great television.  And to everyone's surprise in the business part of NBC, the show became a success.  And then the advertisers found it and--especially when it moved to Fox.  The advertisers realized that this was an upscale black audience watching this show.  And so, the insurance companies, Mers--Donlen Chrysler, you know, Mercedes, Cadillac, State Farm, so--American Express; the high-end advertising companies that wanted to reach, you know, an upper echelon African American audience started supporting the show.  And so, that first show was the Nineteenth Image Awards, and I think they just did the--what is it, the fortieth?  Yeah, they just did the fortieth or the forty-first.  So, I did it for fourteen years, and I'm really proud that I birth the baby and that it lives on.  And one of my trainees and proteges and staff members, who came up through the ranks, is now the producer of the show, Vic Bulluck.  So--
Speaker 2: Now, did you have any issues with Willis Edwards?
Speaker 1: The only issues we had was sometimes I would feel like, again, Willis was his own worst enemy in that he would alienate some people, and so, sometimes we'd have to come around and smooth some feathers or, you know, repair some bridges.  That was our biggest problem.  And then when the national [NAACP] decided that the show was big enough that they--they wanted to take it away from the Beverly Hills-Hollywood branch.  I was very torn about that because I knew, you know, they had done it for eighteen years before we took it to television.  And it really was their baby, meaning the Beverly Hills-Hollywood branch.  And so, I did think that that was unfair.  But Willis and I have a great relationship now, and I think a lot of mutual respect because, you know, I told him what I think his worst strategies may be or his issues are.  But I think that he appreciates and respects what we did with the television show and how much we cared about it.  And I totally respect the ideas that they had, you know, especially in those years of who should be honored and what would, you know, make for really good television.
Story_ID: 40209
Speaker 1: Now, what were the honorees--what were the criteria for the honorees [of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) Image Awards]?
Speaker 2: They would--they had categories, so there was Hall of Fame; there were awards named after the president and the chairman; and then they had a Humanitarian Award.  So they had different categories and criteria.  But they'd always try to catch people before they were gone, you know, like Ella [Fitzgerald] we had literally in the last year of her life; Sammy [Davis, Jr.] in the last year of his life; Carmen McRae in the last year of her life.  So they try to catch people who hadn't been honored either enough or at all by other award shows and honor them.  And, you know, again, we were always so proud of it because it was a--I'll give you a favorite example of an artist who was huge in the African American universe, but the mainstream audience barely knew who they were; Jasmine Guy won the Image Award for actress in a comedy series for six years in a row for 'A Different World'.  She was a huge star in black America, you know, and we all knew it; yet, I don't think she ever got nominated for an Emmy, you know, let alone win one.  So, the fact that we knew who these people were, and sometimes we'd catch people on their way before the rest of the country knew who Denzel Washington was, you know, or cared; or Arsenio Hall or--there are all kinds of examples of that kind of talent that--and that's why I think the Image Awards is important to this day because whether it's up and coming talent or just talent that, you know, Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee, who are icons, you know, in black America; that is a chance for them to be honored in a classy way in front of the country.  And those opportunities are just very rare.
Speaker 1: There are--I'm getting some good stories out of these--I mean, because you tell them--
Speaker 2: (laughter)
Speaker 1: --and I said I don't know.
Speaker 2: Yes, some of them--Sammy Davis Junior, one of my favorite stories out of the Image Awards was that he had already been in the hospital and had been diagnosed as having cancer that was going to take him out.  So he knew it, we knew it.  So we wanted to honor him, and he came and, you know, as one of the big honorees, we would seat them in the front row and the performers would perform to them.  So before the show, I was backstage and I come around a corner and there is Sammy Davis Junior.  And I just said, "Mr. Davis, thank you so much for coming, and do you know how much we love you?"  And he said, "Yes, and he gave me a big hug."  And he was getting the biggest kick out of--I said, "Mr. Davis, you know we have a seat for you in the front row."  And he said, "If you don't mind, can I just hang out here backstage?"  And I said, "Absolutely."  He was having the best time going from dressing room to dressing room saying "Hi" to people, and just, you know, kibitzing and hobnobbing with everybody backstage, that he stayed back there the whole show.  And I remember (laughter) being teary-eyed with that one because, you know, we knew it was--it was near the end for him, yet he got more pleasure out of just being with his contemporaries than, you know, being honored.  And I thought we did a great job honoring him.  We had Savion Glover, who was, you know, still really a kid, with the Nicholas Brothers performing to Sammy Davis Junior.
Speaker 1: And they both were alive then?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were both alive.  Sidney Poitier did the presentation and, you know, in hindsight, couldn't get much better than that.  And Altovise [Davis] was in the audience and their son, and Sammy gave a really emotional speech which was great.
Speaker 1: --his wife Altovise, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.

Speaker 1: We--"we" being black America, we knew who Oprah [Winfrey] was and what she was obviously before the rest of America did.  I'll never forget my aunt, who lives in Chicago [Illinois], called me up and said, "There's this fantastic talk show host that you guys should pay attention to,"  meaning Oprah Winfrey when she was still just on the air in Chicago.  So, early on we wanted to honor Oprah, and we wanted to do it in a way that nobody else would do it.  And so, Oprah had come to one of the first [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)] Image Awards and had fallen in love with the gospel group, the Winans, who are, in my opinion, still, and unfortunately they're not still together, but they were one of the incredible contemporary gospel groups.  And she had seen them at the Image Awards and then had them on her show and really helped boost their career.  So I knew she was a huge fan.  And they--their careers had taken off now, because they were on their third or fourth album and she had supported them, so the rest of the country had found them.  So we were going to do a tribute to Oprah, and again, we always try to figure out a way to honor somebody like nobody else would.  So I knew that another person that was really important in Oprah's life was Maya Angelou.  And I had had the good fortune to work with Maya on a T.V. movie at NBC.  I supervised 'I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings' as a T.V. movie, and she and I had gotten to know each other during that.  And so, I think she, you know, respected me and obviously I respected her.  So, I called her and asked her if she would be part of the Oprah tribute, and she said, "Yes, absolutely."  And I said, "Here's what I'm thinking about.  I'm going to get the Winans to perform to Oprah."  And she said, "Okay.  That's great.  She loves the Winans."  So, the Winans had a new album out, they wanted to do something off the new album and I said, "You know what, guys, I love the new album, but there's a song that you do on one of the older albums that I just think would be fantastic."  And the song was called "Millions," and the lyric was "Millions didn't make it, but I'm one of the ones who did," and it's, there but for the grace of God (unclear) song.  And so, I convinced them that that's the song they should perform, and they got it.  And even though the record label wanted them to perform something off the new album, they said, "Okay, we'll do that song."  And so, in rehearsal I sat in the seat that Oprah was going to be in, and I said to Marvin Winans, "Marvin, ignore everything else, sing it right to Oprah."  And he said, "Okay.  I got it."  And I said, "Don't worry, we got you covered.  Don't worry where the cameras are."  So, when in rehearsal he's singing it to me sitting in Oprah's seat, chills ran down my spine, and I knew this was going to work.  And--but I didn't know how it was going to work.  Okay.  So, we're doing the show that night and Oprah's there next to Stedman [Graham].  And the Winans start singing, you know, then Maya does her great intro written by Rita Cash, so it was written really well and very poetic.  The Winans start to sing, and during the course of the song Stedman wells up with tears, and tears start rolling down his cheek and then Oprah starts to cry, and before the song is over--and it's a powerful song--they're both just crying like all get up.  And, I'm like, "Wow.  Okay.  I guess we did it right."  Okay.  Flash forward to a couple months later, I'm at a NAACP Convention in New Orleans [Louisiana], and Oprah was there.  And so, I went over to say hello to her, and she said--she said, "Oh, thank you for, you know, doing the tribute."  She said, "You know, Stedman's catching a lot of grief for crying on national television."  And she said, "[Bill] Cosby called him up and said, "Oh, boo-hoo-hoo-hoo, you know," (laughter) "and was teasing him," and she said, "So if you run into Stedman on the floor here at the convention, you know, be sure to tell him, you know, how much you appreciate his being there because he's catching all kinds of grief."  And so, I thought that was a great story, and I said, "Okay."  And so, I did run into Stedman, and so, I thanked him and I said, "Hey, man, you know, I'm sorry.  I didn't mean for that to happen, but obviously it was great television, so thank you."  And he said, "Hamilton," says, "I have to tell you a story."  He says, "And nobody knows this but me and Oprah."  He said, "For"--it was either her birthday or Christmas, he said, "I cut a video tape that nobody else has seen but the two of us about how lucky we have been, and how fortunate we have been for all the success that has come our way."  And he said, "The song I cut it to was 'Millions,' and nobody knows that but me and Ophra.  So when they started singing that song I lost it."  And I said, "Oh, my goodness."  And he said, "So, don't apologize, don't worry, I'll take all that ribbing because you could have not picked a more perfect song."
Story_ID: 40211
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, we were talking about the [NAACP; National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] Image Awards, some of the stories, and you have a Roger Ebert story.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And what made me think about it was when--I feel that throughout my career and my life I've been really blessed with a higher power, you know, looking out for me.  And in the Image Awards, during the fourteen years that I did them, we put a lot of time and energy into thinking about how we would honor people.  And, as I said, we try to do it in a way that would be very memorable.  But I also know that we had some great luck along the way, because some things broke our way that you just couldn't have predicted.  So, one example is we were going to honor the Isley Brothers one year, and we were in the production office with--I had a large writing staff, and the reason I did that is that the brainstorming process in my mind was as valuable as the actual writing.  And so, I made sure to have a diverse writing staff; you know, age-wise, experience-wise, background-wise.  And so, my policy was that any idea was welcomed and--which I learned from Brandon Tartikoff--and that anybody could throw out an idea and we would bat it around.  And I always felt that my skill was determining the good ideas from the bad ones, and then maybe taking the good ideas up a notch.  So, we were in the office and we were brainstorming about what could we do to pay tribute to the Isley Brothers.  And we were just--I had bought a 'Greatest Hits' package, and we were bouncing through 'The Greatest Hits' package, and I'd play the first fifteen seconds of a song, and my writers would shout out the name of the song, you know, just naturally, because it would bring back so many memories for us.  So, I said, "Wow, what if we did 'name that tune,' you know, and did it with the audience?"  And so, one of the members of the staff said, "Well, why don't we use Steve Harvey to do this segment?"  And we said, "Okay.  Let's have Steve Harvey go into the audience and we'll play 'Name that Tune' with the audience, and we'll see if it works.  And if it doesn't work, that's okay," because then the Image Awards wasn't live, it was videotaped.  So I knew that if it didn't work, you know, I could cut it out.  But, we picked, you know, four or five songs, and we told Steve, who was going to be in the audience, but we didn't tell him necessarily who to pick.  And we didn't' tell the audience it was going to happen.  So, he goes down into the audience, and I remember Chris Rock was one of the people that he asked, and you know, you could tell they were reluctant because he was literally picking him up out of the audience and they didn't know what was going to happen.  So Chris Rock got all of the answers correctly, and then we picked somebody else, I can't remember who it was.  But Steve was doing a great job with it.  And he--by the way, before we did it, he wasn't even sure it was going to work.  He said, "You're sure you want to try it?"  And I was like, "Yeah.  And you're so good on your feet that, you know, you'll make it work even if the person doesn't get the right answer."  So, I don't what made him decide to go to Roger Ebert.  And, you know, I guess he thought Roger Ebert, who has this image of being, you know, pretty square.  And none of us knew that Roger happened to be married to an African American woman and that she was sitting next to him.  But none of us knew that at the time.  And so, Steve goes over to Roger Ebert and we play the song and we'll all thinking, "Oh, boy.  He's never going to get this."  And Roger turns to his wife and, of course, she gets the answer right away.  And Steve turned it into a really funny bit.  So that to me was an example of how, you know, pure luck, and sort of, I guess, good karma would be the best way to describe it.  Things almost always worked for us on the Image Awards.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 40212
Speaker 1: So--so at the--why did you stop, you know, producing at--that's like ten--you did it [produced the NAACP; National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Image Awards] for ten years?
Speaker 2: Did it for--well, we did thirteen shows over fourteen years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the true story there is that, I had a falling out with the president of the NAACP, Kweisi Mfume, who had been president for five years while we were doing the Image Awards.  You know, we started with Benjamin Hooks and along the way they changed presidencies.  And so, Mfume was the president, and he was not happy with the amount of screen time that he was getting on the show.  And even though I thought that we'd bent over backwards to make sure he did get enough and much more than the president of any organization on other award shows.  You know, on the Oscars or the Grammys or the Emmys; the president of the Academy usually comes up and makes a sixty-second speech and, you know, that's all you see of them.  And those are on three-hour shows, and we only had two hours on the Image Awards on Fox.  So, you know, I tried to make up for the fact that we couldn't do as much as he wanted us to do by including plenty of audience shots of him throughout the show, and seating him next to, you know, major honorees so that there would be those natural audience shots.  But he was not happy with that.  And the year that we had our falling out, basically he--if I didn't agree to do what he wanted me to do, he said, "I'll make sure you never produce the show again."  And I was told by Fox to cut the best television show, you know.  They said to me, if the NAACP doesn't understand that people are tuning in not to see talking heads but to see entertainment, they're going to find themselves with no network interested in airing this show.  And I had always felt over the thirteen years as a proud papa who birthed the show, I always did everything I could to defend the show to ensure that it was a good television show that hopefully would get good ratings and good critical response and would survive, because I knew what a fluke it was that it had gotten on the air in the first place.  So my unspoken mandate for myself every year was to make sure we deliver the best television show possible, and not to pay attention to politics or personalities or anything else.  And so, I delivered the best television show, in my opinion, and he was not happy with that, and made good on his promise and had me replaced as the producer.
Story_ID: 40213
Speaker 1: Now, did he [Kweisi Mfume; president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)]--the follow-up to that is, did he get what he wanted?
Speaker 2: Well, that year he did not because I delivered the television show.  No, there was plenty of him in the television show, but it wasn't as much as he felt he should get.  But, the interesting thing is, I was replaced by Suzanne de Passe, and my understanding is that three years later, she and Mfume had a falling out over similar issues.  I never confirmed that with her, but my understanding is that, again, they had a disagreement over the amount of air time that he had in the show.  And as a good producer, she was making sure that the television show came first, and he got rid of her too.
Speaker 1: Now, he was a--did he have a particular message he was trying to deliver for, say, that period of time or was it--?
Speaker 2: Yes.  He presented the President's Award every year and he would select the honoree.  And the President's Award that year he decided to present to two honorees and that made it much longer.  And in those days when the Image Awards was not live, I always would, what we call "tighten things up" in the editing bay, where you would--I'd cut out things along the way, hopefully in a way that the television audience didn't realize it.  But I was making up time so that I could include more awards in the show.  There was always a battle for time, because in an average two-hour award show you might get fourteen awards on the air with your entertainment and that kind of thing.  So, I was always trimming internally.  So, for example, the winner would be announced and it might take them forty seconds to walk to the stage.  In the editing bay, I'd cut that down to twenty seconds, which you would never feel watching the television show; but over the course of the television show I might pick up three, four minutes that would let me include another award.  And so, when we shot the award that Mfume, you know, presented to the two people, it went literally seven-and-a-half minutes, and that is just too much time for any single award.  And so, in the edit bay, I cut it down to five-and-a-half minutes.  And, again, it still worked.  So, he presented the award, the honorees got to make, you know, their speeches and everything, but I had tightened it up.  And I tried to convince him that it still was good television and still plenty of him, but he literally said, "If," you know, "if you don't air my award in its entirety, then I'll make sure you never produce the show again."  So--and in hindsight, I have no regrets about it because your job as producer of the show is to deliver the best television show and that's what I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The same thing happened with Suzanne [de Passe; who succeeded Cloud as the producer of the NAACP; National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Image Awards] eventually?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  And again, I've never confirmed that with her because Suzanne and I know each other professionally, and I've never asked her, you know, "What was your falling out specifically?"  But what I heard through the grapevine was it had been something very similar over some content issue that he wasn't happy about.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, those are the only two directors that you worked with?
Speaker 1: So--well, yes.  I was the original producer and then--yeah, those were the only two NAACP--oh, I'm sorry.  Ben Chavis [also a HistoryMaker] was president one year that we did the Image Awards of the NAACP.
Speaker 2: Okay.   That's--now, he got in trouble--that's before he got in trouble?
Speaker 1: Yes, exactly.  But--yeah, I had great relations--and I had had great relations with Mfume before that.  But that particular year he also was upset about his seat, where he was seated in the audience.  I had put him next to Steven Spielberg, and he wanted to sit next to Halle Berry.  So--and when he found out, he was upset about that.  And I--because we were doing a tribute to Halle Barry that year, I couldn't change the seats, and he wasn't happy about that.  So, those two things combined led to my departure.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 40214
Speaker 1: Now, when you produce a big program like that [NAACP; National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Image Awards for telecast], you've got to really be sensitive to all the--a lot of different interests, I suppose?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It's a real juggling act because you have a lot of egos in the room, and a lot of--you know, in Hollywood, there are people who don't like each other or do like each other, and so, it's like a big party and anybody's who's done a banquet or wedding and has had to worry about a seating chart, you know, has had this same issue; who do you sit with who.  But then, also, because the cameramen, on an award show, have to be able to find the honorees, you know, or the nominees as their names are being read.  And so, you have to seat them near the aisles so that the camera guys can find them easily and shoot them.  And so, it's always this giant puzzle.  And literally, I had a staff--on my staff for the Image Awards and on any large award show, there's a department which is called the seating department, that has two or three people who literally are juggling all those seats, you know, with the producer's input and the director's input, ultimately, to make it all work.  But it is a giant puzzle.
Speaker 1: In terms of a production a lot like that, about how many people are you directly supervising?
Speaker 2: Good question.  And a lot of people don't know this, but by the time--you start with a small core staff of maybe fifteen people, and over the course of, let's say, an eight-week period that you're producing the show, the staff grows.  So by the time you're actually shooting, you know, rehearsing and then shooting, you're probably at a hundred people, including what's called "below the line," which involves the technical crew, and your writers, your production assistants, your editors, your talent department, your, you know, sound; all those things that go into it you--obviously, the camera and folks and so on, you end up with around a hundred people when you're on the--
Speaker 1: That you have to directly (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yeah, as the producer.  A lot of people say, "What does a producer really do?"  And what a director does and what a producer does it gets confused, especially between features and television.  Because in features the producer basically brings all the elements together, and then once it gets on the set, the director is the person in charge with the producer sort of in the background.  On a television show the producer really is at the end of the day making all of the major decisions, including who to hire as director, writers, lighting people, talent department; all those departments the producer is deciding who to hire.  And usually it's based on people you've worked with before or are recommended to you or that you liked their work because you've seen it on other shows.  And at the end of the day, the producer decides, you know, who's going to open--who's going to host the show, who's going to open the show in terms of, you know, which act is going to open, what order the awards are going to be presented in, what set--what the set is going to look like, how the award is going to be presented, you know, like the examples I gave you with Oprah [Winfrey] and the Isley Brothers.  And then when the show is shot, the producer is in the truck or control room, depending on where it's being shot, making decisions as it's happening.  The director is taking care of all the technical things at that point and telling the cameras what to do and when to cut and all of those things.  But the producer is still saying, "Okay, play them off," you know.  For example, on an award show, everybody's now familiar with the band that starts to play during the acceptance speech to tell the person "Okay, your time is up, get off."  So the producer is in the truck saying to the director, "Okay, play them off," or if it's a particularly emotional speech, the producer may say, "Hold off, let them go, let them go."  And then, if you have post-production, if it's not a live show, the producer in the editing bay is working with the editor to make all the decisions as to what to leave in the show, what to take out, rearrange the order possibly, you know, what to leave on the cutting room floor.  And then the producer goes on to work with the network and decide how to promote the show, you know, what are the great clips that you could pull; you know, what should a newspaper ad look like, et cetera, et cetera.  So the producer really in television is the--sort of the head honcho who's overseeing everything, and ultimately responsible for every decision.  So, you know, that's why I did make the decisions I made on the Image Awards.  And I felt in hindsight that usually I was making the right decisions.  And, you know, you--on an average show you're making a thousand decisions.  And so, if 900 of them--you know, or 950 of them are the right ones, you feel like you did a great job (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  That's a massive job.
Speaker 2: It is.
Story_ID: 40215
Speaker 1: Tell me about--now, is there--before we leave this big production scenario here, what was your proudest moment, you know, producing the [NAACP; National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] Image Awards?
Speaker 2: If I had to pick one of those--it would be--you know, it's like picking your favorite child, I guess.  It's very, very impossible to do.  But I was really proud of the fact--and in fact, recently, because I haven't done the Image Awards now for ten years, so.  You know, I've been away, but I've had quite a few people come back and say, "You know, it's really obvious the tender loving care that you and your staff put into the birthing of the show and those first thirteen shows that made sure the show was established and solid and became a Hollywood institution, so it wouldn't be as susceptible to the normal things like ratings, you know.  So, if there's a down year, it won't mean the Image Awards, because our goal was that this show should become an institution and be as important to Hollywood in general and to the country in general as it was to the African American community.  So, I think if I had to, I really would say overall I'm most proud of the fact that we created some incredibly memorable television, which, by the way, it's still--we still want to do a "Best of the Image Awards," because there are these gems that were only seen once and have been locked away in a vault ever since then.  And it amuses me, and I find it exciting and fascinating to see some of the clips that have made their way onto the internet, that the only way they could've is somebody who recorded the show at home, probably on VHS, you know, uploaded it.  In fact, I think one of the most visited Luther Vandross clips, you know, is the Image Awards clip of him that have--I can't remember the numbers, but some phenomenal number of views that it's gotten that I guess it's up on YouTube, I think.  And people have told me about other clips that are out there in the universe.  So, you feel like, okay, we did birth the baby, and we did sort of make sure it could walk, and it could talk, and it could read, and it could ride a bike; and then, you know, you let it go out in the world then, and it's still going strong.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Who's it--oh, do you think--I know you didn't choose the awardees, but do you think that the Image Awards played a role in the Oscars that Denzel Washington and Halle Berry--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, gained during that period?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I do think it had an impact.  You know, again, we were really proud of--the Halle Berry story I told as an example, the fact that we tended to be ahead of the curve in recognizing talent.  And one year we had Denzel and Halle host the Image Awards.  And Denzel was always a great supporter from day one, and I think it's because he appreciated and watched how the show grew from the very beginning.  And he and I had known each other from NBC when he was doing 'St. Elsewhere' and I was an exec.  And very often the country was being first exposed to particular talents on the Image Awards, and so, we did feel that, because Hollywood's [California] a small town and producers are watching other shows all the time, and so, we knew that producers of some of the other award shows would watch the Image Awards to see, you know, what we were doing, that some of the ideas that we would see later on other award shows might have originated with something that they saw on the Image Awards and, you know, so, we can't take credit for it, but we do think that sometimes Hollywood will really start to pay attention to somebody after they've won an Image Award, you know, so.
Story_ID: 40216
Speaker 1: Is there a--do you remember the demographics of your audience [at the NAACP; National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Image Awards]?
Speaker 2: Ah, good question.  Yes.  They're--ethnically, there were more non-African Americans watching the show than people generally thought.  And the age range--one thing that was great, as television becomes, you know, more and more narrow in terms of its audience, the Image Awards was one of those rare things where people of all ages could watch it, and they'd be something there for them.  So, you know, we made sure--for example, with an outstanding new music artist, that there was something that a younger audience would be interested in.  And we had a youth acting category, and that was a way to include young actors in the mix so that a young audience could watch the show with their parents and enjoy it, you know, just as much.  And, I'll never forget, I'd became aware of how fast public taste and knowledge and interest in things changes.  One year, my nephew, who was maybe seventeen, eighteen [years old] at the time, came to a rehearsal, and this was about five years after a certain late-night host had gone off the air.  And my nephew said, "Who's this Arsenio Hall guy?"  I realized, "Wow, it's happened that fast," that he didn't know who Arsenio Hall was because Arsenio had been off the air.  And then a similar thing happened, he says, "Who's this Prince guy?" because Prince, you know, had become "The Artist Formerly Known As," and he was opening our show that year.  And my nephew came to rehearsal and he said, "So, who's this Prince guy?" (laughter)  And, you know, it was astounding to me, but again, in that age, you know, if Prince hadn't been around since he was twelve [years old] and now he's seventeen, you know, he wouldn't know who Prince was.  So, I was proud of the fact that the show still is something that people--that families can watch together and enjoy, which doesn't happen that often in television any more.
Story_ID: 40217
Speaker 1: Okay, now, simultaneous, I guess, with the [NAACP; National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] Image Awards, you had formed, after your NBC stint, as vice president you formed the Imaginary Entertainment.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And tell us about the development of that and some of the acts.
Speaker 2: So, when I produced 'Welcome to the Fun Zone', one of my partners in the show, one of my producers, was a guy named Jay Levy, who I had known for a few years, and he was already managing Doctor Demento and Weird Al Yankovic. And so, when the Fun Zone did not get picked up, Jay said, "You know, would you have any interest in forming a company together and let's manage some more artists and produce projects."  And I had always been interested in personal management and knew how important it was to especially develop African American talent, because there weren't that many black managers, and especially there weren't that many who had experience on both sides of the fence and knew what buyers were looking for, and what networks were looking for and so on.  And I had seen examples while I was at NBC of how, with the right piece of talent, you could literally build companies around a star.  And, you know, nowadays it's much more prevalent to see celebrities with their own production companies and they go on to become producers.  So, Jay invited me to join him, and we formed Imaginary, and Weird Al's career was taking off, which was really amazing.  We--my next trip to Japan was with Jay and Weird Al, and "Eat It" had come out, you know, which was one of Al's early hits; it was--
Speaker 1: A parody.
Speaker 2: --a parody of "Beat It."  And we went to Japan, you know, literally, maybe a month after the song had come out, and people on the street in Japan knew who Weird Al was and recognized him; and, you know, "Oh, Weird Al."  And we did a round of Japanese television shows, and that was another case of seeing the power of television; not just in our country, but all over the world.  And, you know, MTV [Music Television] was really taking off at that point and, literally, through the power of music videos and television, Al had become an international celebrity and it was an amazing thing to watch.  So, we had Weird Al, Doctor Demento, and a writer named James Hall.  And Jim came to us one day, and Jim's very, very bright.  In fact, he's from--he was from Winnetka, Illinois; and we, in fact, before I left and formed Imaginary, Jay was managing Jim and they came to me when I was an exec at NBC and pitched me an idea called 'Television's Greatest Commercials'.  And it was one of those classic ideas of, "Why hasn't anybody done this before.  That seems like a great idea."

Speaker 1: Just for the record, my name is Larry Crowe, interviewer for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, what is your name?
Speaker 2: Hamilton Strawbridge Cloud, II.
Speaker 1: And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is the--is it the 30th?  Okay. April 30th, 2011.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We are in the office of Congresswoman Maxine Waters in South Central, Los Angeles [California].
Story_ID: 40219
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's pick up with Imaginary Entertainment.  You were telling a story about Jim [James Hall] from Winnetka [Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --who had an idea for a commercial or something.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So it was--when I was still an executive at NBC, my friend Jay Levy was managing a writer named James Hall, and they pitched me this idea of television--Jim was doing a lecture tour where he had collected--now you got to remember, sometimes it seems so strange to think about this because the technology has moved so far, but at that time I think VHS was just really taking hold.  So this is long before DVDs.  But Jim had collected what he considered television's greatest commercials off of television shows--
Speaker 1: This is '84 (1984), right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: (unclear)
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  So, when they pitched me the show, it was probably '83 (1983).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, they pitched me this idea, 'Television's Greatest Commercials'; and I thought, "That's a really good idea, and I wonder why nobody's done that before."  And so, I took it to Brandon Tartikoff and he liked the idea, and we decided to develop it, and we turned it over to Dick Clark's--no, I'm sorry--to Johnny Carson's production company.  And they turned it into a television special, and they did three or four of them.  So--okay, flash forward a couple of years; and I joined Jay Levy.  We formed Imaginary Entertainment, and Jim was still a client of the company.  And Jim came to us and he said, "What would you guys think about a book, you know, an autobiography as told to on Miriam Makeba?"  And I had known who Miriam was and had been a fan from my childhood because my mom [Frances Willard Smith Cloud], you know, exposed me to all kinds of culture, and she was a huge Harry Belafonte fan.  And so, and then I had worked with Belafonte on 'Grambling's White Tiger' [television movie].  So, I knew who Miriam was and Jay and I talked about it.  And Jay knew who she was because South Africa and Apartheid, you know, were becoming a major topic, political topic at the time, and Miriam was still in exile from South Africa, because [Nelson] Mandela was still in prison, and she was in exile living in Belgium and in Cote d'Ivoire [Ivory Coast, Africa].  And we thought it was a great idea.  Jim--I can't even remember.  Jim had been introduced to Miriam through a mutual friend and pitched her the idea and she liked it.  And so, we thought it was a great idea.  And so, we packaged that book and were able to sell it to some publishers, and Jim wrote it.  And the great thing is, here's Jim, this middle-class white guy from Winnetka, Illinois, who wrote a book that was so incredible and was able to absorb Miriam's voice so that when you read that book you'd swear Miriam wrote it.  And she did write it with Jim in the sense that she would tell him stories, he'd write it up, bring it back to her, she'd give him notes and her, you know, suggested changes and everything.  But when you read the final product you would think she had dictated it into a--because he had all of her mannerisms and speech patterns and everything.  So, we managed Miriam Makeba.
Story_ID: 40220
Speaker 1: And we got a call at one point that Paul Simon wanted to meet with us [Imaginary Entertainment], and so, we went to New York.  And Paul had done 'Graceland' and, you know, I think that that album's going to go down in history as a major landmark for any number of reasons besides all the awards it won and everything else, but for purely cultural reasons.  Paul wanted to put together a tour--on the album he had recorded with Ladysmith Black Mambazo and some other South African artists.  But he wanted to do a tour, and I think he knew at the time that he was going to take some heat because, you know, some members of the far left were criticizing him, and the term they used at the time was for being a quote, unquote, "cultural imperialist," that he was ripping off this South African cultural and using it on his album, and he was going to reap all the financial benefits and that that was not acceptable.  And so, I think to counter that, but also because of the kind of person Paul is, he wanted to do a tour for the album which is what most music artists do to help sell albums, that would be a real showcase of South African musical talent.  And I had never seen an example of this kind of artistic generosity before where he literally said to us, "Hey, you know, this is going to be a Paul Simon concert, but I really want it to be a road-show of South African music so that we can expose this incredible music to the world."  And so, we thought it sounded great.  And so, he says, "I'd love to have Miriam [Makeba], you know, she's the mother of African music, and Hugh Masekela, and Ladysmith Black Mambazo, and this great South African band and, you know, I'm going to play the stuff from Graceland, and maybe at the end I'll do one or two Paul Simon songs, but I want the majority of the show by far to be South African music."  So, we went back and discussed it with Miriam and she thought that it was a good thing and recognized that, because of the audience that Paul Simon had worldwide, that it would potentially expose South African music to a much broader audience.  Nobody was going to make a lot of money, but the great thing--because the cost of touring, it was literally a road show.  I can't remember the overall number, but there might have been, no exaggeration, sixty people on the road; because, you know, Ladysmith was a large group, and we had wardrobe people and hair people, and Miriam's backup singers, and Hugh--you know, a couple of Hugh's people.  So it was a large touring group.  So, Paul said, "I'm not going to take any fee for the tour.  We'll pay all of the musicians, and then I want to create a formula where if there are any profits at the end of the tour we will distribute them to charities."
Story_ID: 40221
Speaker 1: And he [Paul Simon] said, "So, I," because he liked Jay [Levy] and myself and thought that we knew what we were doing, he said, "With, you know, if you guys would create a formula where each city that we play there's--I want a South African charity, a National American charity that's working with black issues, and a local charity that's working with issues, you know, with people of color."  And so we did.  We found a South African charity called 'The Children of Apartheid' that Reverend Allan Boesak had created.  We worked with the United Negro College Fund as our national black charity; and in each city that we played we'd designate a local charity that was doing great work in that city.  So everybody's happy with the way the formula worked.  And we were playing arenas so, you know, 15,000 people arenas, and what was great about it is the--we went to London [England] to rehearse, and I could tell that Paul was being true to his word in that he was going to do a lot of Graceland, but he gave [Hugh] Masekela, you know, a chance to do a small set within the show; he gave Miriam [Makeba] a chance to do a small set within the show; Ladysmith Black Mambazo did a set within the show; and then they all did things together.  And then at the very end, because the audience, you know, had come to a Paul Simon concert, he had to do the "The Boxer" or, you know, some Paul Simon song.  But 90 percent of the show, if not 95 percent, was South African music.  And it would send chills down my spine every night of the show because here, these huge audiences were being exposed to music they never would have heard otherwise if Paul hadn't done it.  And so, the other thing that I found very interesting is Miriam and Hugh would do interviews along the way.  In fact, I even had Hugh as a guest on my radio show here in Los Angeles [California].  And they would be asked about this cultural imperialism issue; you know, "Do you think Paul Simon is ripping off South African music, you know, for his own benefit?"  And Masekela had a great answer that I'll never forget.  He said--he said, "Look, musicians, we borrow from all the music that we've heard, you know, growing up or, you know, that we're influence by.  You know, we wouldn't be musicians if we weren't influenced by other musicians.  You know, none of us are coming from Outer Space and landing on Earth without having absorbed all the other culture that we've been exposed to during the course of our lives.  So the fact that Paul's been exposed to this music and likes it and has figured out a way to make it accessible to a Western ear, and desirable, and that he's giving credit to the people who originated it and sending people back to find earlier Hugh Masekela albums and Miriam Makeba albums, and Ladysmith Black Mambazo albums, how could we possibly not be supportive of that?  This is fantastic."  He said, "If you told me that I couldn't incorporate, you know, something along the way that I couldn't incorporate some Beethoven or some Bach into what I was doing, I'd be upset by that; you know, that that's what musicians do."  And so, I thought that was a very cool answer.
Story_ID: 40222
Speaker 1: And then the other great episode that I think is worth sharing is, we were in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and we'd been doing the tour [Graceland] for a while, and because Paul [Simon] was a high-profile target.  He was sort of an easy target.  So there were anti-Apartheid groups that thought that they could raise their own profiles if they came out and picketed the show, because they'd get news coverage, you know, for picketing a Paul Simon concert.  And, we understood what they were doing in that they were trying to take advantage of the profile that Paul had at the time, but we all thought that the criticism was unfair.  And Miriam [Makeba] came up with an idea that I thought was brilliant.  We were in Philadelphia and some groups had thrown up a picket line outside, and Miriam says, "I want you to go outside and find the leaders of, you know, who--whatever organization is outside picketing, and tell them that Hugh [Masakela] and I want to talk to them, and bring them backstage."  So we were doing two or three nights in Philly [Philadelphia], this was the first night.  So I did that.  I go outside and we brought back a couple of people into the dressing area, and Hugh and Miriam sat down and basically read these people the riot act.  And they said, "Look, we appreciate what you're doing to try to bring attention to Apartheid, and we all want Apartheid to end, but you picked the wrong target.  So what we want you to do is come to the show tonight, be our guest, here's some tickets.  Come to the show tonight, and if you don't think this is a positive thing, then if you want to come back tomorrow and picket the show, again, you're welcome to do it."  And, of course, the people came to the show, saw how incredible it was and the picket lines were gone.
Speaker 2: Who were the people in Philadelphia?
Speaker 1: You know, I can't remember now which groups they were.
Speaker 2: I remember on the activist side of this, people had mixed feelings about it.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Paul Simon was seen as an artist--in three instances where he was the front person in front of a black mass choir--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --on one album--
Speaker 1: Yes, "Loves Me Like A Rock."
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And then--
Speaker 1: Dixie Hummingbirds.  That's who it was, yes.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Dixie Hummingbirds, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And then he's in front of, you know, Hugh Masekela and, you know, Ladysmith [Black Mambazo], and--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --I think it was Enzola Sounds of Band (ph.)--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --and then they see that, and then later on it was the Brazilian--
Speaker 1: Yes.  Rhythm of the Saints--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --after Graceland, yes.
Speaker 2: After Graceland, that's right, with Olodum and all of them.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: But there are discussions that people had on the activists' side.  I knew people in the National United Front in Chicago [Illinois] and other places that discussed this, and I think people had to come to the conclusion that it was an anti-Apartheid concert--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and I attended the one in Chicago and it was anti-Apartheid.  It was a moment when we sang that South African--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --the ANC [African National Congress]--
Speaker 1: National Anthem--
Speaker 2: National Anthem.
Speaker 1: Nkosi Sikelel'iAfrika, yes.
Speaker 2: Right.  It's a poignant moment, and I think--
Speaker 1: With everyone's fist raised, yes.
Speaker 2: That's right.  Incite everybody.
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 2: You know, so, these thousands of people--
Speaker 1: God bless Africa.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 40223
Speaker 1: Did you produce the televised--there was a concert [Paul Simon's 'Graceland'] that was televised from--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --the Coliseum.
Speaker 2: No.  I did not produce it, but yes, there was.  Actually, they shot a show in Botswana that ended up being the DVD.  And I was not there for that, but that was part of the Graceland tour.  Because we did a European tour first, and it worked so well over there that we decided to do a domestic tour.  But, yeah, that discussion is always so interesting because one thing that made Miriam [Makeba] and Hugh [Masekela] comfortable, and Hugh knew this from, you know, having known Paul over the years, is that Paul always gave the South African musicians co-writing credit on any songs that they had helped co-write.  So, it wasn't like he was coming in and taking their song and saying it was a Paul Simon song.  He would have written the lyrics, but he was always giving them co-writing credit, which for a musician is the life blood, you know, because they're paid residuals for every unit that is sold, and if it's used in films or any other usage.  So, for a lot of those musicians that he worked with when he recorded the album, that stream of income was going to be very substantial.  And, you know, I thought the point that Hugh had made--and I remember how earlier in my life when I had been exposed to Cream or the Rolling Stones or any of the other British--the Beatles--any of the British bands, I remember early on thinking, as long as they're giving credit to the originators, you know, so, if the Beatles are mentioning the Isley Brothers or Little Richard or, you know, the Stones are mentioning the original blues guys--
Speaker 1: Buddy Guy?
Speaker 2: --yeah.  Buddy Guy and Howlin' Wolf and Robert Johnson; you know, that--it was at the end of the day a positive thing because they were exposing, and I saw this happen when I was in college where young white kids who were fans of British blues bands, were being driven back to the original music and becoming huge fans of these blues guys, sometimes much more than Black America was embracing it, you know.  I remember while I was in college doing a Buddy Guy, Junior Wells concert where I did the lights for the concert and, you know, hardly any of the black students came; but the white students loved it.   And so, you know, I always felt like that was a positive thing if they were giving tribute and helping expose, and in their interviews saying, "Oh, yeah, I've been a fan of B.B. King, you know, my entire career," like [Eric] Clapton would do.  In fact, many years later on the [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)] Image Awards, we were doing a tribute to B.B. and I approached Eric Clapton and he agreed to do it, and George Benson agreed to do it.  And we had been chasing George Benson for ten years and finally got him to be part of the B.B. tribute.  And B.B. was there and he wanted to play with him, and so, we ended up with a great Image Award moment.  But--and, in fact, Paul even--this is a story that people don't know.  Paul even offered to do a performance on the Image Awards.  This was during Graceland, but we couldn't get Ladysmith Black Mambazo in to do it, and so, ultimately we decided not to do the performance.  But Paul presented an award with Whoopi Goldberg.  And I remember thinking, "I can't believe I'm turning down a Paul Simon performance," you know, but we couldn't make it work the way we all wanted to make it work.  In fact, we approached Sweet Honey in the Rock to sing with Paul in place of Ladysmith Black Mambazo, but they couldn't get out of a date that they had already booked, and so, it never happened.  But, I remember thinking, "I'm turning down a Paul Simon performance."  So yeah.  I think that those kinds of cultural mixes are what make all art more interesting, you know.  If it had been a black American artist recording with the South Africans, one, they wouldn't have received the criticism; but, two, the project never would have been as big.  You know, it wouldn't have received the attention that it did.  And I give Paul a lot of credit for being able to take this incredible music that he had been exposed to, you know, a friend who's a--who I actually know in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] had sent him a tape of, I think of Ladysmith and a group called Stimela.  And Paul, you know, was blown away by the music and said, "I got to work with these guys."  And so, he went and recorded stuff, but then he figured out a way to put his lyrics on top of this music and made it accessible to an American ear that never would have happened on its own, you know.  So it--and so I give him enormous credit for--that's the artistry of figuring out how to make it work on American pop radio, you know.  You take this great South African riff and then he writes, you know, this funny lyric, "You Can Call Me Al," and pop radio is playing South African music (laughter).  That's pretty amazing.
Story_ID: 40224
Speaker 1: Now, one thing I wondered about when I saw the concert [Paul Simon's 'Graceland' tour] in Chicago [Illinois] was the health of Miriam Makeba.  Was that really--
Speaker 2: Good question.  Miriam at the time was dealing with high blood pressure for sure.  But--and she, I forget how old she was at that point; in her sixties.  So the rigors of touring were taking an effect.  It was great though.  We'd go to towns and the South Africans would all come out, and Miriam would cook for them or they would cook for Miriam.  And, you know, I had always wanted to do a rock tour.  I always thought that, you know, that would be very magical and, you know, you come to find out that it's really hard work, and it's really exhausting because you literally are, you know, you do your date, you eat--get on a bus or a plane and fly to the next city, and then you go to your hotel, you grab a couple hours sleep, then you go to do sound check, then you're doing the show, and then you're doing it all over again.  And so, you know, you rarely got to see anything or do much of anything, and because the South Africans in each of the cities, you know, wanted so desperately to see Miriam, and she wanted to interact with them, you know.  She'd be up late, much later than she should've been.  And, you probably were seeing some exhaustion because we, you know, we weren't working as hard as she was, and we were exhausted.
Speaker 1: I think she was in a wheelchair in a couple of them.
Speaker 2: Oh, wow.
Speaker 1: Remember?  Do you remember that?
Speaker 2: No, I don't remember that.  But it--
Speaker 1: Maybe I'm getting it mixed with another--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --show, but I remember it.
Speaker 2: She definitely was having blood pressure issues.  But I can't remember her ever getting in a wheelchair.  And, you know, working with Miriam was really interesting because we learned a lot about African culture, and obviously about South Africa and Apartheid. And so, we participated in, for example, she was in the big Wembley Stadium [London, England]--a [Nelson] Mandela birthday concert, she and Hugh [Masekela] were part of that, and I got to go to London to be part of that.  And so, we were all working very hard trying to expose the evils of Apartheid and help bring that end about.  So when Masekela--I'm sorry.  When Mandela was finally released from prison, it was such an amazing thing to happen.
Speaker 1: This is 1991, and then I think the tour was '92 (1992), when it actually came to the United States in--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.  So now, we weren't working with Miriam anymore at that point, Jay [Levy] and I.
Story_ID: 40225
Speaker 1: But I just remember there had been a couple events--there's now been three events in my lifetime that I never thought I'd see happen.  One was--I'd hoped that [Nelson] Mandela would be released from prison, but then to be elected president was just an amazing thing.  The other obviously was, I got to work with Stevie Wonder.  And a friend of mine had introduced me to Stevie, and this was even before I went to NBC.  But then we made the Saturday Night Live thing happen and, now I can't--forgive me.  I can't remember the date, but Stevie had started his campaign to try to get the Martin Luther King birthday turned into a national holiday.  And he asked me if I would help produce a national radio fund encouraging people to call and write their congressional representatives in support of the holiday.  And, I got to work with somebody that became a really close friend, who we've now lost named Chuck Sutton, who's part of the Sutton family in New York; Percy's [Percy Sutton] nephew that, you know, created Inner City Broadcasting, and owned WBLS in New York, and a number of other radio stations.  And so, we created a national telethon that we did out of BLS in New York, and maybe KGLH here in L.A., and it was celebrities coming on encouraging people to support the holiday.  Well, even while we're doing it, we're thinking, "This is a pipe dream," you know.  We all want it to happen, but it's never going to happen.  But, hey, Stevie's doing everything he can, and this is an effort worth making.  You know, because Ronald Regan was president, so we're--we're assuming this is never going to happen.  But, maybe if we could, you know, create a groundswell of letters to congressional representation, they'll pay attention and maybe down the line they'll consider it or something like that.  Well, the radio part was a big success.  I can't say that it made the difference, but Stevie continued his efforts.  And lo and behold, [President] Ronald Regan, you know, the House signs it, and Ronald Regan--I mean the House passes it and the Senate passes it, and Ronald Regan signs it into law.  And that was the second thing that I never thought I would see in my lifetime, and obviously 2008 is the third.  But those are three great milestones that you just assume you're never going to see.
Story_ID: 40226
Speaker 1: What about some of the other performers they have now--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --with Imaginary Entertainment?
Speaker 2: Well, got to work with a great jazz artist named Jon Hendricks, who was part of 'Lambert, Hendricks and Ross', which was a groundbreaking vocal jazz group in the '50s (1950s) and '60s (1960s).  And Jon was not only a great performer, but an incredible lyricist who has taken a lot of jazz classics and written lyrics to them so that vocalists can do them.  And, he created a style called "vocalese."  And right when I started to work with Jon, Manhattan Transfer had just recorded an album called "Vocalese" that took that style to a whole another level and literally got it exposure even, I think, in the pop world.  I think it won some Grammys and--major, major album which I highly recommend to anybody who isn't familiar with vocalese.  And so, we started working with Jon Hendricks and his group and managed them.  And, again, what surprised--well, it didn't really surprise me, but frustrated me, was that Jon was a huge hero in white America, who knew vocal music.  So, we would go out to these vocal competitions with vocal groups, you know, whether they were choirs or whatever of all white kids, and they knew who Jon Hendricks was because they had been exposed to Manhattan Transfer, to Lambert, Hendricks and Ross, and to Jon as a solo artist.  And I was still doing radio, and so, you know, I was always trying to expose that kind of music or any cultural interesting music through my radio shows.  Because after college, I had moved to the West Coast and continued to work in radio on weekends and at night even while I was doing my television career. I--you know, I worked at KEGB, which became KACE, K-ace; and I was doing a jazz show and a gospel show; we should talk about the gospel show--and then at KPFK.  And one of the things that I always was trying to do was expose a black audience in particular to music that was incredibly rich, that they were not hearing in other places. So, working with Jon was a great experience; got to go to Europe with him; did some music festivals in Italy that were spectacular in these old concert halls in Italy, because Jon had written--he had written a landmark play called "The Evolution of the Blues" before I worked with him.  But then, after the show that we did together--now, I'm blanking on the name of it.  But Jon mounted it, and it was a musical story telling of where the blues had come from, and how it had morphed into jazz and rhythm and blues.  And Jon was just a master at writing lyrics and knowing how to make it all accessible to people.  So, we did that in Europe and a few times here in the [United] States.
Story_ID: 40227
Speaker 1: If we could talk for a minute about one radio show that I did that I'm really proud of, and this also ties back to the [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)] Image Awards.  When I came back from college [Yale University], I was working for KFWB Westinghouse, but on the weekends I was working for a radio station called KAGB, which was a black-owned FM Station which was still very rare in those days.  And the general manager was a great black radio pioneer named Del Shields.  And the program director was Cal Shields.  And because I had a background in public affairs programming, they asked if I wanted to host the Sunday night talk shows.  And so, I created a show called 'Speak Out' that was a one-hour interview show.  But then after 'Speak Out' was on, there was a two-to-three block that they had to fill on a Sunday night, and Dale--Cal asked me, say, "Hey, would you mind sticking around and just playing some gospel music, because on our license renewal commitment we've promised to play X amounts of gospel music a week.  So will you just stick around and play some gospel music?"  And I said, "Well, I'll do it if you let me do a concept that I have in my head."  And he said, "What is it?"  And I explained it to him and he said, "Yeah, that sounds like it could work.  Okay.  Go ahead and try it."  So, I created a show called 'Innervisions', which I borrowed from Stevie Wonder obviously.  And it was, in my opinion, ahead of its time in that it was a contemporary gospel show where I took contemporary gospel, traditional gospel, and I mixed with pop and reggae music in a way that nobody had really done before.  But I was taking pop music that had a positive message.  So I was taking Stevie Wonder's "Love's in Need of Love Today," or Earth, Wind, and Fire's "Keep Your Head to the Sky," or "You're a Shining Star," or, you know, and a Bob Marley song, "Three Little Birds," "Everything is Going to be Alright," or--gosh--try that--or maybe a Brenda Russell tune or Isley Brothers' "Harvest for the World."
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Those kinds of positive message songs.  And I was mixing them with traditional gospel music, so it might be the Dixie Hummingbirds or The Five Blind Boys or James Cleveland with what was just starting to happen with contemporary gospel.  So, the Winans, you know, in particular, Shirley Ceasar, The Mighty Clouds of Joy.  I was mixing them all together, and musically it was working really well.  And the way--I mean, I knew it was working just from a listener's point of view and as a producer-host point of view because it was working seamlessly, and I would record the shows and listen to them, you know, later in the week, and I'd go "Yeah, yeah.  That works," and, you know, sometimes it would be a little jarring, but it was an amazing amount of positiveness.  I, you know--and I would even mix in white artists that were doing positive message music.  So, Amy Grant or Paul Simon or James Taylor, you know, "Shower the People you Love with Love," or "You've Got a Friend," you know.  As long as it was a positive message of music.  And, by the way, Gil Scott Heron; my theme song, that opened with Gil Scott Heron every week.
Speaker 2: So what piece was that?
Speaker 1: Oh, "Offering."
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It's called "Offering."  It was a two-and-a-half minute song off of Gil Scott Heron, Brian Jackson, and the Midnight Band--oh, golly.  It's the brown album, but I'm blanking on the--
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: --with the gorilla on the front.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I can't remember the title, but that's the album that it's on.  And every week I would open with that, "We have music to offer you."  So--and, and you know, I would even include some Alice Coltrane or Pharoah Sanders or--
Speaker 2: I was going to ask you about Pharoah.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: "The Creator has a Master Plan."
Speaker 1: Yes, exactly.  "The Creator has a Master Plan" is a perfect example.  "Peace and Happiness Throughout the Land."
Story_ID: 40228
Speaker 1: So you were really trying to find a common denominator in black inspirational music primarily [with Cloud's radio show, 'Innervisions'], I guess.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Of course, I mean that the common inspiration--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --part of it, not necessarily the religion part of it but the-
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --the--
Speaker 2: That's a great way to describe it.  And there were two ways that I knew it really worked, you know, people would tell me that I run into during the week.  But when people told me that they would tape the show and play it in their cars off on cassettes, you know, throughout the week, I said, "Wow," because they said it's so inspirational, it's so positive, it's so uplifting that on a Sunday night, "It lifts my spirit, and so, I want to hear it the rest of the week."  And so, you know, I had quite a few people tell me they would tape it and play it in their cars over the course of the week.  And then I remember literally at one point in one of the ratings books, it was the highest rated day part of KACE's entire week.  You know, it was higher than their regular programming, and that was pretty rare, because normally in those days Sunday night was sort of a throw-away time when, you know, all the radio stations were taking care of their license commitments with religious programming or--
Speaker 1: Talk.
Speaker 2: --talk shows, community affairs shows.  And so, I was very, very proud of that, and I hope one day to be able to revive it because gospel music has now, you know, come quite a long ways and is much, much more popular, both black and white.  And I still think that there's a way to mix that music that people aren't doing.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  That goes back to the H-U-R days.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, exactly.
Speaker 1: (unclear)(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: That's--yeah.  I mean--
Speaker 2: Yeah, positive music, you know.  So yeah.  Gil Scott's probably the best example.  But I also would use some Watts Prophets or Last Poets, if it wasn't profane (laughter), you know, or Gil Scott as part of the mix.  And I think I even used some Doctor King.  So I was taking things I had done in New Haven [Connecticut] and using them here.  And then I also made a point on the Image Awards of always ending the show with one of those kinds of positive, uplifting songs.  Whether it was--oh, I'm going to blank on the titles now, but Howard Hewitt did a song called I think, "A Prayer," or "Amen."  It may have been "Amen."  Just a soaring song.  Or the last Image Awards I did, I had Yolanda Adams close the show with an incredible song, and I had the Winans a few times.  And I was very proud of that because I knew that that wasn't happening on television anyplace else, you know, because even the syndicated gospel shows were just starting to happen, I guess, it's like the Dove Awards (ph.), and the shows that Don Jackson does out of Chicago [Illinois] or the Stellar Awards, were just starting to happen towards the end of the Image Awards--my run on the Image Awards.  So I was really proud of being able to do that and give exposure to some artists that, you know, were still--people have to remember, before Arsenio, the Tonight Show, you know, was one of the only places you could get that kind of exposure, you know, other than Ed Sullivan, which was over by then.  So, those artists were slipping through the cracks.  They couldn't do American Bandstand or even Soul Train because that music wasn't considered popular enough, you know.  And there weren't those late night shows for them to perform on other than the Tonight Show, because this was before Letterman even took off.  But they just weren't being booked.  So it was great to be able to give those acts exposure.
Speaker 1: Now, how long a run did you have on the radio with this?
Speaker 2: I did 'Innervisions' for twelve or thirteen years, and [likely radio station name; unclear] went belly-up I think, finally.
Story_ID: 40229
Speaker 1: And then--then I started doing a show on KPFK, which I--and I'm so glad you catch these connections.  So in New Haven [Connecticut], I had done Black Spectrum.  So out here [Los Angeles, California] on KPFK, which is the Pacifica station, I was asked to come do a music show, and so, I called it Spectrum, the best black music from around the world.  And, again, because I had the freedom to mix all kinds of music, I was playing African, Reggae, jazz, gospel, R&B, blues, Latin; whatever made sense.  And I did that show for thirteen years.  And along the way I brought in a couple of guest hosts with me.  And one in particular, Paul Hall, who's a very successful film producer, we had met years ago when he was in television.  We both worked at Channel 7 together, and it turned out our dads had known each other in Birmingham, which we didn't find out until many years after we knew each other.  My dad [Hamilton Strawbridge Cloud] was listening to the radio show, and my dad was my biggest fan, and he would call me every night when I was doing a show, and he--one night after Paul and I were doing our thing together he said, "Ask Paul where his dad is from."  And I said, "Paul, where's your dad from?"  He said, "Birmingham [Alabama]."  And my dad said, "We went to high school together."  And so, they had both gone to Industrial High [school] in Birmingham.  So, and Paul and I had known each other maybe seven or eight years at that point, and that just kind of, you know, blew our minds.  But we would do this radio show where we would sit around and talk about music.  And we'd turn each other on to new music and then also share our knowledge of classic music.  And so, we would--Paul has--had a, because we don't buy CDs like we used to, but he had a worst record-buying habit than I had.  That was our drug of choice, was to go to Tower Records and drop a hundred dollars, you know, on CDs.  It was a horrible habit.  But, we'd turn each other on, you know, on the air by saying, "Hey, have you heard the new album by so-and-so?  Well, you know, you gotta hear this."  And then we'd play something, and then we'd talk about it and say, "Yeah, you know, I can hear some Pharoah Sanders in there, you know," or "Oh, yeah, there's a little [Duke] Ellington influence in there," or whatever we'd tied it back to.  And we'd tell stories about having seen, you know, whether it was Sammy Davis, Junior or Ellington, as I mentioned.  So, we did that show and had a great time.  I think I did it for thirteen years.
Speaker 2: Now, what station was Spectrum on?
Speaker 1: Spectrum was on KPFK, which is the Pacifica Radio Station here in Los Angeles, still on the air.  And I got downsized out of that show.  It was my first experience with ageism.  They had brought in a new program director who was a young Asian woman, and she decided that she--literally she calls me up one day and says, "Okay, so this week is your last show."  And because we were all volunteers, nobody was being paid, there was really no recourse, you know.  But she was making the change because she had decided, and I'll never forget this, that she wanted something "younger and more street."  And I thought that that meant she wanted a hip-hop show.  And not being a big fan of hip-hop, I thought, "Well, I'm not the right person to do a hip-hop show, so I don't blame you for not wanting me to do it."  And because I had just--my wife [Fukue Yamaguchi] and I had just had our daughter [Anju Cloud], I thought that maybe this was God's way of telling me to take the three or four hours that I spent doing that radio show every week, you know, planning it and then driving to the station and actually doing the show--maybe it's five hours with all of that--to take that five hours and, you know, devote it to my daughter, to add it to the normal time I would spend with her.  And so, I thought, "Okay, I had a good run and it's not a problem."  But, when I finally heard the show that they replaced me with, what bothered me was 50 percent of the music was the same; it was not a hip-hop show, but it was a (sic.) announcer style that she wanted.  She wanted somebody who was going to use what I called "fake hip-hop lingo" to host this show because she thought that would be a way to attract younger listeners, which I know failed because it didn't work for them, because the show didn't last very long.  But, you know, at that point I had moved on and--
Speaker 2: And did they retain the same name?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They created a new show and changed the name, and I don't even remember what it was.  But, I know it didn't last very long.  And I had a thirteen-year run, so in radio terms that's a long time, and--
Story_ID: 40230
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm amazed here as I hear you tell these stories about how busy you must have been in those days.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Working in television and doing the radio show.
Speaker 2: Doing radio.  Yeah, and working in television.  And, you know, yes, I was very busy, but also I know how lucky I was in that I had an understanding wife who liked music.  And I'd always had understanding girlfriends, so we'd go see a lot of music.  And, I was thinking that I should just share a couple of stories with you of incredible music.  I mean, I literally was going to two or three concerts a week or comedy clubs.  Sometimes for work at NBC, you know, I had to know who the upcoming comics were, and for the radio I had to stay in touch with what was happening musically, and just as a fan.  So, if I had to tell you some of my favorite concerts, I literally--I got to see Bob Marley at the Roxie Theatre here in Hollywood [California], which is a 450-seater, and it was his first U.S. swing.  And I have never done any illegal drugs, but that's the closest analogy I can come up with that it was like what I imagine, you know, being exposed to heroin or some other drug that has that kind of strong, physical, impact on you is like.  To see Bob Marley in a nightclub, I was blown away.  And literally, I remember looking at his tour schedule and seeing that the next night he was going to be in Berkeley [California] or in Oakland at the Paramount Theatre.  And I had some friends in the Bay Area [California], and I called them up and I said, "Are you guys going to see Bob Marley tomorrow night?"  And they said, "Yeah."  And I said, "I'm coming.  Get me a ticket."  And so, you know, back then it didn't cost anything to fly to San Francisco [California], and I was working multiple jobs and had money to spend, so I jumped on the airplane and went up to Berkeley and saw him the next night in Oakland [California] at the Paramount Theatre and was hooked on Bob Marley, you know, ever since then.  And--
Speaker 1: This was about 1978?
Speaker 2: 1977 or '78 (1978).  Yep. That's exactly when it was.  And I was lucky enough that I got to see him two more times during his life.  And I started playing him on my radio shows, you know, and talking about him. And, it's interesting how much this stuff ties together; on one of the early [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)] Image Awards, Bob [Marley] had passed in '81 (1981), and so, in either '86 (1986) or '87 (1987), and I may have suggested this one to the NAACP--I think I did--that we honor Bob Marley posthumously.  And so, we flew Rita Marley in and Ziggy [Marley], I think, and they were there to accept the award on behalf of Bob.
Story_ID: 40231
Speaker 1: And I'll never forget this story.  Years later--and I'm sorry, I'm jumping ahead--but I'm working for Quincy Jones, and again one of my major idols; and Quincy is one of those people that, you know, especially after "We are the World," whenever somebody wanted to do a big multicultural, international-type of show, who better to call than Quincy Jones?  So, [President] Bill Clinton was in the White House and was going to do a Summit of the Americas, where he was calling together all the Heads of State in the Western hemisphere and they were going to meet.  And I--I think this only happened--it wasn't an annual event.  I forget how often it happens, but he was going to do it in Miami [Florida].  And so, Clinton went to the Kennedy Center and asked them to help him put together the gala entertainment for the night he was hosting.  One of the nights of the three or four day summit was a gala of entertainment.  And so, he went to the Kennedy Center and he said, "Can you guys put together something that really would be representative of the whole Western hemisphere?"  And the Kennedy Center thought who better to call than Quincy Jones?  And so, I was working for Quincy, and Quincy's very, very busy; so he can't drop everything else he's doing to deal--he knew how important this was, you know.  He was friends with the Clintons and he wanted to do a great job, so he turned to me and said, "Hamilton, run with this ball," you know.  "Pull it together, pull together a team; obviously run everything by me and, you know, I'll either agree or disagree, and you'll put together a show."  So we decided let's do something where we'd have entertainment from every region of the Western hemisphere; so from the tip of South America, all the way up through Canada basically.  And to represent the Caribbean, I thought, "Oh, well, Bob's [Marley] gone, but why don't we reunite the 'I Threes', which were Bob's backup singers; so, Rita Marley, Judy Mowatt, and Marcia Griffiths.  And to my pleasant surprise, we tracked down Rita and she remembered me from the early [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)] Image Awards.  And I said, "Rita, what about this idea," and you know, "For Bill Clinton, for the Summit of the Americas for Quincy Jones?  Yeah."  (laughter)  Because they hadn't--I don't think they had ever been reunited since Bob was gone.  So, they came and did the show, it was in Miami, and again, one of the things that I'll be most proud of my entire life, because I was able to pull together a great staff.  Jeff Margolis directed it, you know, A-List Hollywood director; I brought in some Latino talent execs who knew that whole universe that I wasn't as familiar with; so they knew who was hot in South America, you know, and Mexico, and--I mean, we had Paul Anka representing Canada, and Liza Minnelli, I think for the United States, and the I Threes for the Caribbean, and Daniela Mercury for Brazil, and some Argentineans and Chileans and--anyway, it was a fantastic show.  But two quick stories from that; we were putting it all together and we couldn't find a host.  And, the show--PBS--first we pitched it to the big networks; ABC, and, NBC, and CBS, and they all passed on it because, you know, it wasn't enough talent in it that they recognized to do it.  And even being produced by Quincy wasn't enough for them.  But PBS agreed to air it; WETA in Washington, D.C. [District of Columbia], became the sponsoring station; and they decided to roll it into a series that they already had on the air called "The Kennedy Center Presents."  So, it was a great fit for them.  And for them, who hosted it was not as important as it would be for the other networks.  And so, we still couldn't come up with a host, even though we had some great presenters in the show; Michael Douglas came, and Jimmy Smits, and Whoopi [Goldberg] may have been there; you know, because they--almost everybody we were calling was agreeing to do it because it was, again, Bill Clinton's and Quincy Jones's calling.  So, we still couldn't come up with a host.  And one day we were in a creative meeting, and we were grinding our teeth, you know, brainstorming, and the light bulb went off in my head, and I said, "We have the perfect host.  It's Quincy," you know, because given what this show is, who better to be the ringmaster.  And so, Quincy hosted it and it felt like, of course, that that's, you know, we had planned that from day one.
Story_ID: 40232
Speaker 1: But, the other story, we're shooting the show [gala for President Bill Clinton for the Heads of States of the Western hemisphere] in Miami [Florida] and all the Heads of State are there, and the Secret Service had come in and done a bomb sweep and, you know, shut us down during rehearsal for an hour so that they could bring the dogs in and do all the bombs and everything, and they told us, "Hey, we're going to be here, but you won't necessarily know who we are, where we are, you know, et cetera," because not only are they protecting the President of the United States, they're protecting the Heads of State of the entire Western hemisphere.  So, it would have been a horrible target, you know, for--this was in, oh, boy, 2000; no, 2004 maybe?  No, no, no.  This would have been 1996.
Speaker 2: '96 (1996).  That's it, yeah.
Speaker 1: (laughter).  I'm off by eight years.  1996.  So, at one point during the show, I had to get from one side of the stage to the other during one of the breaks, but there, in this particular theatre in Miami, there was no big backstage area, so I basically, you know, when the cameras were down in between acts, I basically had to hightail it across the front of the stage which, under normal circumstances, you know, nobody would think anything about it.  So, I didn't think anything about it, and I'm walking very quickly across the front of the stage, and I can feel this energy in the house where all of a sudden all these Secret Service guys, who don't know who I am (laughter) are all, you know, coming to the balls of their feet, getting ready to move to come intercept me.  And, when I felt this energy, because nobody actually made a move towards me, but I can feel the energy, you know, the light bulb went off in my head and I slowed down and realized I shouldn't be running across the front of the stage here, because they don't know where I'm going and what I'm doing.  So I slowed down and continued to cross the stage and I was fine.  But afterwards, after the event was over and all the Heads of State went out on a yacht, we heard that, again, this is one of those examples of knowing something is a hit by feedback that you get.  We heard that all the Heads of State were out on the presidential yacht, The Sequoia, smoking cigars and singing songs from the show that we had just done.  And so, we knew we had chosen correctly and it had resonated.  And they were all so proud, you know, because had people from all of their countries, and they weren't just being exposed to, you know, American acts.  So, I will always be proud of that.  And Quincy [Jones] was really happy and, you know, everyone involved, I think, took a lot of pride in the success of the show.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 40233
Speaker 1: I want to go back and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: --talk about something that I--there's a writing credit in here for 'The Compleat Al'.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: What was that about?
Speaker 2: When Jay [Levy] and I were managing Al [Yankovic], and we got an offer to do a project for Showtime, which was still a young network at that time and trying to compete with HBO, and willing to try a lot of things.  The--Jay Levy and a guy who had worked on 'Welcome to the Fun Zone' with us named Robert Weitz, who we call Bob, Bob Weitz, we were brainstorming and they, the two of them were big fans of the 'Compleat Beatles', which was, you know, a documentary about the Beatles.  And so, Al being a satirist, we decided, "Why don't we do a 'mockumentary' on Al's life called, 'The Compleat Al.'  And so, we took a lot of the forms of documentaries and sort of turned them on their heads and did a comedy film about Al's life.  And we took real things in Al's life, but turned everything on its head.  And so, you know, there were a lot of funny references to foods.  And then we spread music videos throughout the film as, you know, stories in Al's life.  And so, because we created it all together and wrote it all together, I got a writing credit on that.  And it was so much fun because in the early days of Al's career we were producing all his music videos, and Jay was directing some, Bob directed some, and I was producing.  And we just had great fun, because, you know, there wasn't a lot of money in those days to do music videos.  This was early enough in their development that the labels weren't giving you a lot of money.  So we had to really stretch those dollars and come up with ways to either spoof the original song, you know, as Al did so effectively with "Eat It," and "Fat," where he took Michael's [Jackson?] original videos and did his spin on them; two original pieces, we did a Ricky Ricardo spoof where he took "Mickey," the song "Mickey" and made it "Oh, Ricky, you're so fine."  So, we had a lot of fun doing those things.
Story_ID: 40234
Speaker 1: We were talking about your involvement with Quincy Jones's QDE [Quincy Jones/David Salzman Entertainment] Productions, Quincy Jones/David Salzman Entertainment, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Quincy Jones had been one of my heroes as far back as I can remember, I guess because of my mom [Frances Willard Smith Cloud] exposing me to movies and soundtracks, and my dad [Hamilton Strawbridge Cloud] being a jazz musician before he went straight to become a dentist, and then my being a disc jockey in New Haven [Connecticut] and loving what Quincy was doing, because he was bridging the gap between jazz and pop and R&B [rhythm and blues].  And, you know, even before he was doing Michael [Jackson] he was such a pioneer with his own music; and then producing Brothers Johnson and Chaka Khan with Rufus, and all those things he was doing.  He was just such an idol of mine.  And ironically, I had met a guy named David Salzman in my Westinghouse days.  He ran KDKA in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].  And when I graduated from college, David had offered me a job to come work with him in Pittsburgh, and I turned it down and came out here to work at KFWB.  But many years later, Quincy and David Salzman were forming a company because the president of Warner Brothers, Steve Ross, had decided that they would be a perfect marriage because David was sort of, you know, business broadcaster and Quincy this creative genius.  So they were forming a company together.  And David called me and asked if I'd have any interest in joining them, and I said, "Oh, absolutely."  So, I had a great interview with Quincy, and we shared stories and everything.  And so, went to work for QDE after six years with Imaginary [Entertainment; Cloud's production and personal management company].  And we did the 'Concert of the Americas'.  And then one of the other projects that I was really proud of was a project called 'The Roots of Country', where Life Magazine was going to do a special issue called 'The Roots of Country', and--I--now I can't even remember how it ended up coming our way, but the idea of Quincy Jones being involved in a country music special struck everybody as so strange, but again, Quincy knowing my background said, "Hamilton, why don't you honcho this one and, you know, let's shoot it down in Nashville [Tennessee] at the Ryman Auditorium," which was, you know, one of the homes of country music.  And Quincy was close with a number of country artists along the years that he had just developed his own relationships with.  And what was so cool when we went down to Nashville to shoot it was to watch the country artists who knew him, and even those who didn't know him, react to him because he is just such an icon and such a hero of everyone in the music business, that you would have thought he was a country music producer the way they embraced him.  And so, we did this really great country special that aired on CBS called 'The Roots of Country', where again we went back to the history, to the beginning and sort of traced the roots of country music and had these incredible performances on the stage of the Ryman Auditorium.  And I think people still shake their heads and say, "How did Quincy become connected with a country music special?"
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Story_ID: 40235
Speaker 1: That's interesting, like, country music--a lot of the roots of country were made popular by that Coen Brothers' new movie, 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' Or something like that.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.  Yeah, and especially because you can see the commonality between blues roots and country roots; that they were rural musics (sic.) from the South.  And I think there's a lot of respect between country musicians and blues musicians because they're people who--another thing that really impressed me about Nashville [Tennessee] was that the musicians would drive themselves to the Ryman and take their instruments out of their cars and bring them, you know, carry them in themselves.  There's--in Hollywood [California] and New York when you're doing a big music special there's this thing called "cartage" that you always have to put into your budget, where you hire people to bring in the equipments and the amplifiers and all of that, and you hire limousines to bring the artists to wherever you're shooting.  But in Nashville, just the opposite, you know.  They all would drive themselves there and, you know, cart their own stuff in; and I was so impressed with that.  And, you know, they were very willing to do whatever was necessary in rehearsal to make it right.  And it was a great music special.  And I became much more of a fan of country music as a result of doing that.  We worked with a production company that I'm blanking on the name of, who really knew a lot about country and were able to teach me, you know, what I didn't know.  And then Quincy knew, you know, a lot more than I even thought he knew.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the stars at the Ryman Auditorium?
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh.  I'm going to draw a complete blank on the stars of the show.  I would have to go back and look at a list and then I'd know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Slap myself for forgetting.
Speaker 1: There's a mix of some of the stars that have passed and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: (unclear)
Speaker 2: Yes, exactly.  Vince Scale, I can remember as one of them, as an example of one of the--at that time, newcomers, who was--
Speaker 1: Did Flatt and Scruggs perform?
Speaker 2: I don't remember Flatt and Scruggs being part of it, but there's another female artist that Quincy's [Jones] actually the godfather of her daughter, and I'm feeling horrible I can't remember.  I'm embarrassed.  I apologize.
Speaker 1: (unclear)
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 40236
Speaker 1: At any rate, now, I want to go back to 1990 in our chronology here, because we forgot to talk about your involvement with Playboy Entertainment.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Okay.  Good point.  A headhunting firm reached out to me at Imaginary [Entertainment; Cloud's production and personal management company] and asked if I'd be interested in a position that was coming up at Playboy.  And Jay [Levy; cofounder of Imaginary Entertainment] and I, to our own fault, one of our mantras had been that we wanted to have a company that was honest, and never cheated any of our management clients, and always put the money on the screen in our production projects.  And in the long run, it's very difficult to run a successful company that way, and so, we had lost a bunch of money with Miriam [Makeba], you know.  We were not taking commissions, and we had dug quite a hole for ourselves.  And so, Imaginary is struggling, and so when this offer came along, Jay and I agreed that maybe I should jump at it and, you know, sort of go back out in the world and take a good paying job.  So, I did the interview with the headhunting firm, and I'll never forget that they interviewed me and I gave them a copy of my resume, and they called me back a couple of days later and they said, "We can't believe it, but everything on your resume is true."  (laughter).  I thought, "Well, what do you mean?  Do you mean you get resumes that aren't accurate?"  And they said, "Yeah, you'd be amazed at how people exaggerate on their resumes.  But everything on your resume is accurate."  And I thought, "Okay.  I know I'm lucky, and I know I've had a really exciting career, but I didn't realize how many people I guess aren't that accurate on their resumes."  So, I had a great interview with Christy Hefner, who ran the company.  Hugh [Hefner] was still involved on the creative side, but Christy was the, you know, the business side of the company.  And they were looking for a V.P. of Production, and I had a lot of obviously experience both on the network side and as an independent producer.  And so, she and I hit it off, and they offered me the position.  But the real, you know, impetus for me was that I'll never forget my dad [Hamilton Strawbridge Cloud] telling me how in the '60s (1960s) when the Playboy Clubs were operating and they opened their club here in Hollywood [California], what it meant to African American professionals that they could become Keyholders.  Because, you know, segregation was still--even though we were in the '60s (1960s), was still a reality, especially here in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], you know, you had this unspoken segregation.  So, the fact that Hugh Hefner with this major enterprise, national profile would open and welcome Africans, not just on stage, because he was known, you know, for giving a lot of exposure to Dick Gregory and Bill Cosby and people like that, and was a huge jazz fan.  The fact that black professionals could become Keyholders and join the Playboy Club meant a lot to me--it meant a lot to my dad, obviously, and his sharing that story meant a lot to me.  And so, it made sense to me that I would join Playboy.  And the other thing that really impressed is that, when I told Christy about the [National Association for the Advancement of Coloree People; NAACP] Image Awards, because I was producing them, and said it was really important to me that I have the ability to continue to produce them, and she said, "Oh, no, that's really important, and I understand why that's important to you.  And not only would we let you continue to produce them, but if there's any other way we can help let us know."

Speaker 1: And so, I was happy to take the job and spent two great years with Playboy [Entertainment].  We moved from the Sunset Strip to Beverly Hills [California], and I worked on a lot of interesting projects that were both what people would normally consider "Playboy kinds of projects," which we would call--inside they were called "beautiful naked women projects," to other things that Playboy hadn't necessarily been known for.  So, for example, I did a project where we took a franchise out of the magazine which was there--every year they do an annual college football preview and a college basketball preview, where they pick their own sort of All-Star, All-American team, and list them and take photos of them.  So we took that franchise and turned it into a syndicated television show with a company out of San Francisco [California].  So, I was really proud of--we also did a series of tapes for the Sharper Image that were designed for couples only.  It was literally called that.  So, I was, you know, I enjoyed working on the other projects, too, because Playboy, with its product is--has always had a reputation for doing very classy product.  So, it was fun to work on these high-end classy productions that, you know, featured beautiful naked women, but then also to help expand the perception of what Playboy could do and so we did those.  And, ironically, I met my wife [Fukue Yamaguchi] during that time, and people asked me often, "Well, how did your wife deal with that?"  And I'll never forget that I invited her to come to one of our shoots, and she saw how boring it was.  I mean, yeah, the actors might be naked part of the time, but, you know, it was like any other video shoot or film shoot.  And so, she saw how hard everybody was working and how boring it was, and she never needed to come to another one after that.
Story_ID: 40238
Speaker 1: Now, how did you meet your wife [Fukue Yamaguchi]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I'm very lucky.  I've had great relationships over the years and still friends with most of my girlfriends.  But at a New Year's Party, my youngest sister had gotten married on December 30th here in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], and she married a guy from Houston, Texas, and his family was all in town, and they were here for New Year's Eve and had nothing to do.  And so, I thought it was only appropriate that, you know, his new wife's family should throw a party for New Year's Eve.  So we had a--I had just bought my house earlier that year, and this was in an '83 (1983) transition to '84 (1984).  So, I threw a New Year's Eve party for them, and my wife came to the party as a friend of a friend, and she had had a fight with her boyfriend that night, so came solo.  And, my radar picked up on her, and even though she wasn't very impressed with me.  And over the course of the next year, it took me a year to track her down because I wasn't quite sure how she had gotten there and whose friend she was, because it was a big party.  And so, I didn't really have a chance to talk to her that night.  But it took me a year to track her down, and I did and we started dating, and then married a couple years later.
Speaker 1: So, this is what, nineteen what now?
Speaker 2: We got married in '88 (1988).
Speaker 1: In '88 (1988)?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So just before the Playboy [Cloud's job at Playboy Entertainment] got started.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So.
Speaker 2: So, we were dating during Playboy.  And she's from Osaka, Japan; moved to the United States when she was eighteen [years old] and taught herself English.  She learned English in Japan, but then really taught herself when she came here for college.  And if you met her, you would think she was American-born Japanese because her English is flawless.  I always tease her that she knows more about English than I do because she studied it, you know (laughter), especially grammar.  She knows a lot of those arcane rules that most Americans never learn or forget, you know.  But, we've had a great marriage and have our daughter [Anju Cloud], who's thirteen now, who's been to Japan five or six times, you know, already.  And I've gone, obviously, on some of those trips.  But we got married here in Los Angeles, and then went to Japan and had a marriage ceremony there also.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Story_ID: 40239
Speaker 1: Now, let me go back and ask you about Montel Williams.  Now, you were producer of that show.
Speaker 2: Yes.  My attorney--I've had a great attorney.  Early on through some college friends, I met an attorney named Nina Shaw, who was one of the few African American entertainment attorneys even to this day.  But Nina's a very high-powered, successful entertainment attorney of any color, represents some of the, you know, biggest names in town, as they like to say, of all colors.  And I've been fortunate to have her as my legal representation from early on in her career and in mine.  And one of her clients is Montel Williams.  And when Montel was at the peak of his talk show success, they renegotiated his deal with Paramount and Viacom and part of it was to have a production company.  I think I may have mentioned before, very often celebrities have production companies where they get to produce projects.  And she asked if I'd have any interest in working with Montel, and my mom [Frances Willard Smith Cloud] was a huge Montel fan, and I knew his back story as, you know, a career Naval officer, who had become a motivational speaker while he was in the [U.S.] Navy.  He created that career for himself.  They didn't send him out.  He went out and found he was good at it and had a successful motivational career which led to the television show.  And, you know, once that took off, the sky was the limit.  And so, he had a production deal at Paramount to produce shows for himself to star in and projects that we could do as a production company.  So, I went and met with Montel and, you know, he and I hit it off.  And along the way, I haven't met many more impressive people than Montel, because he's--you know, he grew up in Baltimore [Maryland] and had interesting life experiences where if, you know, at that fork in the road, if he had made the wrong choice, you know, he could've ended up in prison or dead.  But, fortunately, you know, he did make the right choices and has obviously had an incredibly successful career.  And, I love--the great thing about Montel, and I used to say this in our pitch meetings, is he's a guy's guy who women love.  And the power--and he taught me this--the power of being in people's homes every day is amazing, you know, because they think you're a member of the family.  They think they know you; they will share their stories with you; their secrets with you; and they're very comfortable with you right away.  And, that's a very powerful combination.  And we also used to say that Montel had--let me see if I can get it right.  Because people always assume that, you know, a black talk show host, that only African Americans are going to watching the show, and, of course, that's not the case.  You're not successful if your audience is--you know, Motown would never have been what it is and was if it was just black people, you know, listening.  Obviously, that's the base and that's the key, but there're many more people paying attention.  So same with Montel.  You know--I can't remember the quote now, but his audience was much larger and multi ethnically than people were ever aware of.  So, you know, big white audience, big black audience, big male audience for talk shows, which is pretty rare.  You know, it's still majority female, but a lot more men than other people.  So, we had some interesting frustrations because the business tends to pigeonhole you, and they were reluctant to do projects that other producers might have been able to get off the ground because they pigeonholed Montel as a daytime star, as a talk show host, and as a African American.  So, some of the years were frustrating and some were exhilarating because he knew how to do a talk show.
Story_ID: 40240
Speaker 1: So, I was based in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] on the Paramount lot, and the talk show [Montel Williams] was done in New York.  So, I wasn't involved with the day-to-day operations of the talk show, but I was always aware of what they were doing, and sometimes I could contribute ideas towards that or take a host from the talk show and try to develop something around that person.  We did a great project that I'll always be proud of circling back.  Montel pitched me this story where he said, "What would you think about the story of one of the first recruits to integrate the Baltimore [Maryland] City Fire Department in the '50s (1950s), who, you know, was one of the first trainees, you made, made it through the training program, got on the Baltimore City Fire Department, went through hell, you know, with hazing and razing and just downright racism, both from other firemen and from the public that they were serving, literally saving lives?  One story in particular where he saved a family's life and this little kid spit in his face afterwards."  So, he's telling me this story and I'm going, "This is great.  That's a great story.  I can just see the movie now."  And at the end he says, "And the guy happens to be my dad."  And I was like, "Wow.  That would be a great story," because wearing my producer's hat, I'm thinking, "One, it'll make a great book; and then, two, if we get lucky we can turn the book into a movie, and you can portray your dad."  And so, I called on James Hall, who had written the Miriam Makeba book and had done such a great job with it, and who I knew could get inside the skin of whoever his subject was.  And by now, Jim was living in Africa and had married an African woman and has a family in Africa, which is where he still lives now.  And, I called Jim up and pitched it to him and he liked the idea, and I pitched the idea to Montel's dad, and he said, "Sure, I'll meet with him and see what I think."  And so, Jim flew in, spent some time with Herman Williams, which is Montel's dad, and they hit it off.  And Jim ended up writing the book, and we got it published, and he did an awesome job and told this great story.  And the only reason I think we weren't able to turn it into a movie is that, at that point, Hollywood had decided that it didn't want to do with--literally when we went out to pitch it we were told, "We don't want to do any more bio pics or black pioneer stories or, you know, the first black person to do this."  And I always thought that was so strange because bio pics are always a successful format; they will always be a successful format.  True life stories are some of the most interesting.  You know, as soon as you say this is based on a true story, the interest level jumps dramatically.  So, we were not able to set it up as a movie and, you know, hopefully, there will still be a day where it could be done as a motion picture or a television movie, especially now that there are a few more cable channels that, you know, are focusing on the African American audience.  But, it's a great human interest story, you know.  One thing I've always said is that, good drama is good drama.  It doesn't matter if the subject happens to be, you know, of a certain ethnicity, that doesn't mean that a broader audience isn't going to be interested.  And we've seen, you know, 'Evita' was about somebody from Argentina, but it was a great story.  And, you know, good drama makes good drama, so.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 40241
Speaker 1: Now, did Montel's [Montel Williams] getting ill have anything to do with the end of that--
Speaker 2: Good question.  No.  Montel had a great run with his talk show, longer than most people ever thought it would last.  And, along the way he did come down with MS, multiple sclerosis, and he has been the most amazing--as he says himself, you know, "God picked the wrong person or maybe the right person to inflict with MS," because he has fought it, and unless you know he has it when you meet him you would not know.  And, now that I know a lot more about MS, having worked with him and seen how it's impacted other patients, I think his way of dealing with it has been amazing.  He's just powered through it.  And it does impact him, you know.  He could not run down a football field if he had to.  But, again, unless you were looking for it when you meet him, you wouldn't know.  And when you see him on television now doing the infomercials that he does or the specials or whatever, you can't see the impact that it has.  Now, it's been because he's been very aggressive with it with both traditional and alternative medicine.  As you know, he's a big medical marijuana advocate because literally it's one of the few things that takes away the pain that doesn't just, you know, knock him out, dope him up.  You know, a lot of the traditional medicine, if he was taking it--the dosage he would need to, to deal with the pain, he wouldn't be able to function the way that he does.  But, we did a low-budget movie that he directed, and his wife at the time wrote and was one of the actors in it, and I think if he could ever get the opportunity to be a director he'd be an awesome director, because watching him on this low-budget feature that we did, he has this great combination of being able to relate to actors because he's done some acting now and is much better than people ever thought a talk show host would be.  So, he has great rapport with actors, but he's got his military organization and precision; so he knows how to run a set and accomplish the goals that you have to do in production.  And so, I--and I've told him this, that if he ever gets another opportunity to do that, he's going to be an awesome director because he knows how tell stories.  He did it every day on his talk show.  And that's a large part of what that is.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 40242
Speaker 1: Now, should we talk about 'Game of the Century' or the Democratic Convention?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Let's talk about 'Game of the Century' real quick.  Another great story of a lot of pieces folding together.  When I was at NBC I wanted to help bring an African American assistant into the process, because I knew if I didn't take the affirmative action to do so, it might not happen otherwise.  And so, when I was interviewing for secretaries, I happened to run across a bright young woman and her name is Stacy.  And Stacy became my assistant and was crackerjack.  And then--and the reason I know, and then I'm always proud of these people who go on to have these great careers, like Rita Cash or whoever else; the proud papa in me loves to be able to take a little credit.  So after working for me, Stacy went on to work for the presidents of NBC and Paramount.  She worked for Brandon [Tartikoff] first at NBC.  And then the people who replaced Brandon, she was their assistant, and then she went over to Paramount, so--
Speaker 1: What's her last name?
Speaker 2: Stacy's last name is Milner, M-I-L-N-E-R.  And so, she had a great run as assistant, executive assistant.  She met a young minor league baseball player named Ted Milner, and Ted's a great guy, and he never made it into the bigs, but he loves baseball.  And they formed a company that trains and provides temporary secretaries to the entertainment business.  They specialize in entertainment because that's where Stacy came through.  So they find young people, train them in this specialization of entertainment, and then they're hired by Hollywood studios, networks, et cetera.  So, they've had a very successful company and have made a lot money as a result.  Ted's love for baseball--Stacy calls me one day and says, "Hamilton, can you meet with Ted because he's got this idea that he just is passionate about and won't let go of, and he needs your input."
Story_ID: 40243
Speaker 1: Okay.  We're talking about 'Game of the Century'.
Speaker 2: So, Ted Milner, being a minor league baseball player and loving the game, he--we had lunch one day and he said, "Hamilton, I want to figure out a way to pay tribute to all the Negro League players who are dying off.  Every year we're losing, you know, more and more.  And, I hadn't thought about the fact that the Negro Leagues even existed after Jackie Robinson integrated baseball.  And so, some of those folks played, you know, through the late '40s (1940s), and so, it was possible that some of them are still alive.
Speaker 1: You remember, Jackie Robinson came in in '46 (1946)--
Speaker 2: Yes, '47 (1947)--did he actually come to the bigs in '47 (1947)?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: '46 (1946).
Speaker 2: '46 (1946), okay.
Speaker 1: So, what year are we talking about here?
Speaker 2: So, the 'Game of the Century'.  Man, I am the worst with years.  You might be able to find it if I mentioned it.
Speaker 1: It's mentioned under 2004, but it wasn't (unclear)--
Speaker 2: It could have been 2004 or 2005.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay.
Speaker 2: All right.  So, Ted had this idea of doing a tribute to the Negro Leagues, and I happened to be a Dodger season ticketholder at the time, and I can't remember if he asked my opinion or I suggested it of contacting the Dodgers, because they have a great history, obviously, with Jackie Robinson having integrated baseball, that conceptually they might get this idea, and that they might be willing to let you hold the game there.  And so he did.  He reached out to the Dodgers, and sure enough, they said, "We will give you Dodgers' Stadium for a day; meaning we won't charge you any rent.  You'll still have to pay all the personnel that you hire for the day," which is no, you know, no small tab, "but we won't charge you any rent."  So, Ted asked if I would help him with the production of the game, meaning he had Reggie Smith to manage one of the teams and--now I can't remember who was the second manager, Enos Cabell or somebody else.  And he says, "Well, I got the baseball part covered, you know.  What's going to happen during the game, I've got that covered.  Can you help me produce the media part of the game," meaning everything that's going to happen in the pre-game ceremony up on the DodgerVision, the big, you know, video board, and in between innings."  And--
Speaker 1: Now, let me get this straight.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, the game was going to be in honor of the Negro Leagues, and who was going to participate?
Speaker 2: Good question.  So, he said, "I want to do a banquet the night before, and then actually do a game; not calling it an old-timer's game, but reenact a Negro League's game.  So, I'm going to get--I'm going to borrow the names of two teams."  I can't remember.  He had the Black Jacks, and I don't know if it was the Homestead Grays or what the other team was named.
Speaker 1: Kansas City Monarchs or Homestead Grays?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I can't remember.  But, "I'm going to," he said, "I'm going to use guys who either just retired from the majors or never made it to the majors like myself," so, you know, minor league players, "And we'll have X major leaguers manage them."  So he did.  He put together, I mean--and he included Latin players too.  So, Pedro Guerrero came and played, Mariano Duncan, and I can't remember the other players.  But, he assembled two credible teams.  And he made a real point that he didn't want it to be an old-timer's game because this was going to be a real competitive baseball game.  The only thing that we changed was we made it seven innings instead of nine.  So, he decided he wanted to do it in February during Black History Month, which was a big gamble, because it's still raining in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] in February.
Story_ID: 40244
Speaker 1: And so, he [Ted Milner] asked me to help put together the pre-game ceremony ['Game of the Century'] where we would honor the Negro League players that he flew in from all over the country, including one woman, whose name I'm blanking on who actually did play in the Negro Leagues.  He flew them in, we had dinner in the Dodger Stadium Club the night before, which I think the Dodgers hosted; and then the day of the game, I got Blair Underwood, who I knew is a big baseball fan, and I think had played one of the Negro League players in a television movie as I remember.  Blair agreed to host the pre-game ceremony.  And we had done bios, and had pictures of each of these players that we put up on DodgerVision, and Blair read their intro, and then they came out and lined up on the first base line, you know, to a big applause.  And they had tears in their eyes, and they couldn't believe somebody was actually doing this for them.  And then the other thing that I had produced was all of the pre-game material.  And I'm really proud of this.  Being a Dodger fan since 1959 as a kid, you know, they won the World's Series against the White Sox that year, and having grown up in L.A., and then when I could afford it, I began a Dodger season ticketholder.  You know, I was a big Dodger fan, big baseball fan.  And going to the Dodger games, one of their trademarks was they always would play organ music in between innings.  And in my opinion, to their credit, they did not change that until very recently.  And they still have organ music in between.  But I would sit there, and they play, you know, sort of old-styled, traditional organ music.  And one of my dad's [Hamilton Strawbridge Cloud] favorite musicians had been Jimmy Smith.  And so, I grew up listening to a lot of jazz organ.  And I would always be at a Dodger's game and I'd think, "Wow, what if (laughter)--if one of the classic organ players ever had the opportunity, they could rock this house.  So now, Jimmy Smith was gone by then, he had passed.  But my next best idea came true.  I--because of my gospel roots and my Image Awards roots, I was able to get Billy Preston on the telephone and I pitched the idea to Billy Preston, and I said, "Billy (laughter), have you ever wanted to play the organ in Dodger Stadium?"  And he said--he laughed and he said, "Yeah.  Why are you asking?"  And I said--so I told him what we were about to do, and he said, "Bet, I'm in."  And he, I didn't know at the time until somebody told me, that he already was having kidney failure and was getting dialysis three times a week.  But he-I sure didn't know it.  He came and he rocked the house between the innings, and the audience loved it, he loved it.  And the next day in the L.A. [Los Angeles, California] Times where they reviewed the game, the first sentence of the review in the sports section was, "Billy Preston played the Dodger Stadium organ like it's never been played before."  And it was great.  The game, the weather was wonderful; again, the Higher Powers were looking out for us; the weather was wonderful in February, we had a good turnout.  People came dressed in their sort of--Ted had told everyone they should dress in period clothes to celebrate the Negro Leagues.  And people did.  They wore big hats and, you know, people--and the audience was great; the mayor came and spoke, and City Council people came and, you know, we did the opening ceremony which worked really well.  And then, the magic was the game was really good and really competitive.  And we had decided to make it only seven innings, and it came down to the bottom of the seventh and was won with a homerun that I can't remember who hit it.  But, you know, it was--
Speaker 2: A walk-off homerun.
Speaker 1: A walk-off homerun in the bottom of the seventh.  And the crowd didn't want to go home, they had had such a great time.  And so, a project that I hoped to help rebirth that we did with Ted was that.  And he ended up paying for it out of his own pocket, and I think he spent--and I could be totally wrong here--but I think he spent between four and $500,000 out of his own pocket to make it happen.  And I'm hoping that, you know, with me or without me, he's able to get advertisers interested and do it because the players loved it.  They told him, "Ted, if you ever do this again, you know, we would want to do it."  And then what was interesting, even the Latino players were so honored to be included, you know.  And I hope that's something that he's able to rebirth again because we did not do a television version of it, and the television producer in me, of course, thinks it would make great television.  And the audience just had a great time, and that review in the L.A. Times was really spectacular.
Speaker 2: Okay.  It sounds like it really was something.
Story_ID: 40245
Speaker 1: Let me tell you about two other things very quickly that I'm really proud of.  So after--I can't even remember now when I did these (laughter).  Somewhere along the way, an exec that I had worked with at NBC [in Los Angeles, California] named Phyllis Tucker Vinson, married--she was the vice president of Children's Programming.  She married a guy named Eugene Jackson, who owned WDAS in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], and was a very successful businessman.  And they came to me and asked if I could help them turn an event into a television show.  And we actually did two things that I'm really proud of that ran in first-run syndication.  One was called 'The Miss Collegiate African American Pageant'.  And because both my parents [Frances Willard Smith Cloud and Hamilton Strawbridge Cloud] and my grandmother [Lillian Strawbridge] had gone to Talladega College [Talladega, Alabama], I knew what a rare opportunity it would be for a lot of these colleges to get some television exposure, because they don't have big football teams.  You know, Grambling [State University, Grambling, Louisiana], obviously; but even Grambling and Southern [University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] don't get it a lot of national exposure except for that one annual game.  So, I knew a lot of these small, traditional African American colleges would not get this kind of television exposure.  And I remember the famous annual 'Ebony' [magazine] issue where they would show the campus queens.  And so, I thought, "Wow.  We could do a pageant."  And so, we decided that it wouldn't be a beauty pageant; it would be an all-around person pageant.  And so, a young guy named Frank Mercado (ph.) had come to them with this idea, and they had done the pageant, I believe, without it being televised for a while.  So we decided to turn it into a television show.  And, I was able to get some of the--I turned to some of the people I had done variety shows with, and I tracked down some people who I knew had had beauty pageant experience.  And a guy named Tony Sharmerle, who had directed some beauty pageants, and he brought in a choreographer whose name I'm going to blank on, who had helped choreograph some of these pageants.  And what I loved--when I explained to them what we were trying to do, they treated this small pageant like it was Miss America; like it was Miss Universe.  And they showed us how to do it basically.  And so, we were able--and it reminds me of--in a way of the radio shows I would do where you take a form that the public is already comfortable with, and then sneak the message in, you know, by doing something positive.  And I did it even more in another show that I'll tell you about in a second.  But, so we did the pageant, and we did it at both Universal Studios here in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], at the--what is--used to be the Aquarius Theatre and then it was the Star Search Theatre, and now it's the Nickelodeon Theatre.  I had a relationship there, so we did it there; they didn't charge us a lot of money.  And, it did so well that we were able to move it to Disney in [Orlando] Florida.  And they loved it because it was a positive project.  We were able to take the women out into the park.  You know how in beauty pageants they're always showing, you know, the women touring whatever city they're in.  So we were able to take them out in the park and show off Disney World really nicely.  And because it was a positive event. They loved it.
Story_ID: 40246
Speaker 1: And we did that [beauty pagent show for historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs)] show, I did it for two or three years and then turned it over to Vic Bullock, who had worked with me on the [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)] Image Awards and now does the Image Awards.  And then Vic produced it for a few years after I did.  And it was a successful syndicated television show for, I don't know how many years it ran.  But the colleges loved, the audience loved, the sponsors loved it.  Oh, it never would have gotten on the air without Pro-Line Hair care Products, which Comer Cottrell owned at the time.  And Comer, great small world story; Comer had met me when I was a youngster because he was a postman with my uncle in West Chester, California (laughter).  And so, when I was able to remind him about that, and I think he knew me from the Image Awards also, he agreed to write the checks to make it all happen.  And between Comer and Eugene and Phyllis, you know, they brought the sponsors to the table, and we were able to make the show for much less money than it would have cost anybody else.  And it was a classic win-win-win, and it worked because everybody gave it their all.  And it was great.  So then, the same team, we did a step-dance competition called "Stomp" that we found fraternities-African American fraternities and sororities that had step-dance teams, and found two young great choreographers and did one-hour, step-dance competitions that we shot at Universal and at Disney that also were syndicated; and those ran for, I can't remember how many years now, but I was really proud of those, and again, help birth the babies, and create shows that I think may not have existed without, you know, folks coming together and making them happen.  L.L. Cool J. hosted "Stomp" one year.  I'll never forget it.
Speaker 2: (Unclear)
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And Alphonso Ribeiro hosted one, and they were really good shows.
Story_ID: 40247
Speaker 1: Okay, now 2004, the Democratic National Convention in Boston [Massachusetts].  Now, you produced a part of the convention, right?
Speaker 2: So, I can't even remember where I met Congresswoman Maxine Waters, but somewhere along the way, and it might have been '96 (1996) or--somewhere along the way with [Nelson] Mandela or with a tribute that she did with Harry Belafonte, she talked me into helping out.  And it wasn't something I was being paid for, but because, you know, I was making a lot of money with my other activities, I could afford to do it, and I always loved her ideas and what she's trying to accomplish.  So, I know we did something with Belafonte in one of the years, but then that year she said, "The convention is going to be in Boston, and I'd like to do a tribute to Maynard Jackson, because he's passed and he never got the acclaim from the Democratic Party that he should have, and so, we want to honor Maynard and do something that convention delegates can come to the night before the convention officially began."  And so, working with her daughter Karen Waters, who has an event planning company, we flew into Boston and found a venue on the campus of MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology], a nice theatre over there that was affordable and the right size.  And they brought in--I'm going to--a company out of Atlanta [Georgia], a catering company.  And the Congresswoman--what the Congresswoman really relied on me for, and she would tell me this, and she said, "You know how to handle these big name talents in a way that they need to be handled, you know.  You know what they need and what they're asking for and, you know, what you can not necessarily have to provide but still keep them happy, and you know how to write it and structure it and everything else."  So, she had gotten Cosby and Gladys Knight to agree to perform.  And, as she said, from all those years at NBC and doing the [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)] Image Awards, I did know how to interact with the talent and their representatives.  And, you know, my management had, I knew what their management would be looking for, you know, whether it's things on their riders or in their dressing rooms or how they're introduced or whatever.  So, we put together an event that happened the night before the convention started where [Bill] Cosby opened, and he was supposed to do twenty minutes and ended up doing an hour or more, because he was having a great time and we had set it all up.  And then Gladys came on and did as we--and in show business there's a saying, being probably in the music business more, "she put her foot in it."  You know, she just did a show to be remembered.  And I think it was because it was this great audience who--they were seeing the show for free, but because Cosby had set the tone so well and put everything in context.  And that night, by the way, a young politician from Chicago [Illinois] came backstage and shook a bunch of hands, and I actually missed him that night, but Cosby told me that night that he met this really impressive guy that's going to speak at the convention.  He said, "You know, I think this guy's going somewhere."  And, of course, it was [President] Barack Obama.  And, I did not get to meet him that night, but--
Speaker 1: That's where he made his national (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yes, exactly; when he made the speech in front of the Convention.
Speaker 1: --(unclear) John Carey.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  So, we did a tribute to Maynard Jackson that night, and I think--and then Gladys, you know, did an incredible show, and because of the way we wrote it and put it together.  And again, you know, one of those memories that I'll have forever, Cosby, as he was leaving, he had to leave early to get back home to take care of something, he said, "Do me a favor.  Call me tomorrow and let me know how the rest of the night goes."  So, you know, even though I had met Cosby before, it still was such an honor to work with him.  But, the memory for me is that I called him the next day and told him, you know, how great Gladys had been, and he complimented me.  He said, "You created such a great tone for the evening and put this together in a way that everybody was so relaxed and knew that this was being done for the right reasons, you know.  The Congresswoman's idea honoring Maynard was the reason for us all to come together, but it was done in such a great way that," he said, "I just wanted to pay you some compliments for doing such a great job."  And, you know, to hear that from Bill Cosby, that goes in the treasure chest for the rest of my life.

Speaker 1: But then we, four years later [2008], which may not be in the bio yet, the Congresswoman [Maxine Waters] called and asked if I could help her do a similar thing in Denver [Colorado; Democratic National Convention].  So, once again, Karen Waters and I flew to Denver and found a great venue and did a big event for the 2008 Convention, where we honored a bunch of the Civil Rights organizations on stage.  And then, the Congresswoman thought that everybody loves Frankie Beverly and Maze so much, that to be able to treat them to a free Frankie Beverly and Maze concert would be fantastic.  So that's what we did.  We honored all these organizations from, you know, Rainbow Push, and NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], and the Urban League, and Al Sharpton's group, and a number of others; The National Council of Negro Women.  We honored them and then had a Frankie Beverly concert.  And then I was able to stay in town and go see the nominee speak at the stadium in Denver.
Speaker 2: The Mile High Stadium?
Speaker 1: At Mile High Stadium.  And, by the way, a great synergy simultaneous to the Convention, there was a music festival being done in Denver in Five Points, which is the black neighborhood in Denver.  And one of the performers at this music festival was Hugh Masekela.  And so, I got to go over and see Hugh and connect with him.
Story_ID: 40249
Speaker 1: And then, talk about a great life experience, we--okay, and this'll be a good segway to the record album I produced.  The poet D-Knowledge was with us in Denver [Colorado; when Cloud was at the 2008 Democratic National Convention], and D and I went to see Hugh [Masekela] at this outdoor street festival, and Hugh did a great set that night.  And then we took Hugh to a jazz club in Denver where we knew people were sitting in.  And somebody had invited him to come--or maybe we did, and we got to see Masekela play straight-ahead jazz, which I had never seen before.  And I don't know why I was so surprised that he would be so awesome at it.  But he, you know, he just blew us away playing some straight-ahead jazz.  And that's another one for the scrapbook.  And it was great to see Hugh and reconnect and everything.  D-Knowledge.  So when I was working with Quincy [Jones]--well, I'm sorry.  Even before that.  When I was doing the [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)] Image Awards, we'd been doing them maybe for five, six years, and all--it was the same team.  And I thought--and again, this is one of the jobs of the producer, that the--I didn't want things to get stale and, you know, once you've done them you start to, you know, repeat patterns and things, so I wanted to shake it up a little bit.  And I went a performance at a club in Hollywood [California] called 'The Troubadour', a very famous nightclub, of Meshell Ndegeocello.  And her opening act was a group of poets, local poets, and one of them really stood out.  And I was really impressed with him.  And so, afterwards, after the show, I had made a point of introducing myself to him.  And I said, "Have you ever had interest in writing for television?"  And I can't never forget, he said, "Oh, hell no."  (laughter).  "I don't like television.  I have no interest in writing for television."  And I could tell he was really smart.  And I said, "Oh, that's too bad because I was thinking trying to add to the writing staff of the Image Awards."  And he said, "Oh.  Well, that's different."  (laughter).  "Yeah, I'm interested in that."  So, the Writers' Guild had a, what they called a training program where you could bring young writers with no credits in as a Writer's Guild trainee, and pay them less than you would pay a normal writer, but still a decent salary.  And they would get credit for it.  And then if that led to other jobs, they could eventually join the Writer's Guild.  So, I brought D-Knowledge in--his name is Derrick Gilbert--and he got his master's and Ph.D. while he was working on the Image Awards.  So, he's Dr. Derrick Gilbert, and I was so impressed he was teaching at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles] working on his Ph.D., and then at one point he was up in Berkeley [California] and commuting, and he worked on the Image Awards and was great, because he brought a new energy, and a younger perspective, and contributed quite a bit to the Image Awards.  And so, I became a fan of him as a performance artist and as a poet.  And so, he'd ask my advice on pieces he was writing.  And so, when I'm working for Quincy, I pitched Quincy on the idea of doing a record album with D-Knowledge, just because from back in the day of the Watts Prophets, and the Last Poets, and Nikki Giovanni, and Maya Angelou; all of whom I'd played their records on my radio shows, I knew that a good poetry album would have its own fan base, and maybe if we were lucky, a shelf life, et cetera.  So, Quincy liked the idea, and once again, he said, "Look, I can't give you a lot of money to do it, not what a regular artist would do but, you know, I'll give you a budget."
Story_ID: 40250
Speaker 1: And so, a friend of mine from when I--as kids, there was a guy named Ramon Hervey, who as a great music publicist, you know, was married to Vanessa Williams at one point, and had a great career as a music publicist.  And so, and Ramon had produced some albums that I was really a fan of that were sort of off the beaten path.  So, I introduced Ramon and D [D Knowledge; Derrick Gilbert], and then Ramon and I produced an album with Derrick called, "All That and a Bag of Words."  And, I was able to introduce D to my friend Chuck Sutton, who got him on 'Showtime at the Apollo', and he went out on tour with Earth, Wind, and Fire and opened for them, and still to this day, performs; and people, you know, remember the album and come up and quote him.  And he and I have been friends, you know, ever since then and talk all the time.  And he's gone to teach at Yale [University] and the University of Michigan.  And he's working on a project now that I think is going to be a great book that will lead to other things too.  But, it was really great fun to be able to--you know, another dream come true, like I had always dreamt of going out on a music tour, I got to produce a record album for Quincy Jones's company.  So it was on Qwest Records, and Mike Strafford (sic.) was our exec at Qwest.  And, you know, the album did well and, you know, D performed--his most famous poem is something called "Remember," where he recounts the '70s (1970s) and a lot of icons of the '70s (1970s).  So, anyway, D was with us in Denver helping--he's helped us produce projects and will perform.  One project that we did together that, again, may not be on the bio, but it's worth telling the story of because we've done tributes to Spike Lee and Quincy Jones here in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] that Chrysler used to pay for.  But, one of our biggest is, I was asked to produce the gala opening of the Muhammad Ali Center in Louisville, Kentucky, which if anybody ever has a chance to get to Louisville, you have to see it.  It's a state of the art museum that is not only about Ali, but it's about that period in history.  It's an interactive museum.  And so, they wanted to do a big gala opening.  And so, very much like the project I had done in Miami [Florida], the 'Concert of the Americas', we did a project to honor Ali but also honor everything that Ali has been about.  And, we pulled together all kinds of celebrities and did this big gala in Louisville.
Speaker 2: About what year is this?
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Is it within the last few years or?
Speaker 1: Maybe five years ago.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I figured it was probably around in there (unclear).
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 40251
Speaker 1: So, we're talking about the opening of the museum in Louisville [Kentucky], and you said some of the (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yes.  So, we--they wanted to do the opening of the [Muhammad] Ali Center and, in fact, the president of the Center was a gentleman named Michael Fox, which I always found humorous because it's the same as Michael J. Fox from 'Family Ties'.  No relation, but his name was Michael Fox.  And he wanted to do a gala that was not only star-studded, but paid tribute to all the important aspects of Ali's life that they had incorporated into the themes of the museum.  And we were able to take, you know, a private tour before the museum opened, because it opened during the gala weekend, to see the museum.  And we were so impressed.  I brought Rita Cash in again to write it because Rita's an amazing writer, and a guy named Bruce Cecil (ph.) directed that one for me, and Bruce is just an awesome producer-director, who I've used on a lot of projects and live events.  And I brought Derrick [Gilbert] in to help with the talent.  And Byron Wilson who's been my talent exec since the beginning of any television shows I've done.  So we wanted to pay tribute to these different aspects of Muhammad Ali's life, and I had grown up idolizing Muhammad Ali, I think as most African Americans and most citizens of the world have.  And so, even though we were asking people to fly to Louisville, Kentucky, you know, which is a big ask, because it was Ali they came.  So, people from Herbie Hancock, and James Taylor, and Darius Rucker, and Matt Lauer, and--goodness, Angelina Jolie and Brad [Pitt] were up in the balcony.  They didn't participate in the show; Bryant Gumbel, Montel [Williams] came in and did it for us; goodness, I'm going to blank on some of the other performers that we had.  But it was, again, a highlight of my life.  Unfortunately, we did videotape it, but we didn't have the budget to turn it into a television show, so it does exist, you know, in an archive.  But it was one of those nights because Ali obviously was there, and Howard Bingham, his photographer, you know, spoke as part of the evening and introduced James Taylor, who did 'You've Got a Friend', because Howard's been one of Ali's friends, you know, from the early days.  And it just was an incredible night.  I'm trying to think.  I know there were some other really important people who came that evening and, you know, flew in to be part of the night of--a great percussionist named Vinx, who had also played on D-Knowledge's album.  So, it was just a great example of how once the people in charge trusted us to deliver, you know, the concept and let us run with it, we did and turned it into something very special.
Speaker 1: Is it difficult to do a big production like that in a place like Louisville?
Speaker 2: No.  But actually Louisville was great and rolled out the red carpet, and the hotels were great, and it was a big event in town, obviously.  And, again, if anybody who sees this, if you ever have a chance to come anywhere near Louisville, make sure to visit the Ali Museum.  It's one of those places that, you know, Ali wanted to be true to his roots because he grew up in Louisville and wanted this to be in his hometown, and they knew it would be important if that museum was in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], Chicago [Illinois] or New York, Atlanta [Georgia], [Washington] D.C. [District of Columbia], it would be huge.  But, you know, in Louisville, most people were only going here, you know, for the Derby or maybe to visit the Louisville Slugger Museum or something like that.  It's a little off the beaten path, and I just tell people, if you're anywhere near Kentucky, go visit the Ali Museum.  But that is something that I'm really proud of, having had the opportunity to do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 40252
Speaker 1: All right. Now, what projects are you working on now?
Speaker 2: So, I've worked with Congresswoman [Maxine] Waters over the years, and she had often asked if there was ever any way I could come join her staff.  And, you know, the financial universes are quite different.  So, usually I would just work with her on special projects.  But an opportunity came up for her to add somebody to the staff, and I was available and always wanted to do this, because politics--literally from 1968, I worked--I went to high school with Alan Cranston, who was a senator from California, with his son; we were friends in high school.  And so, I worked on Alan Cranston's '68 (1968) campaign, which was also a very important year in American history because we lost Dr. [Martin Luther] King and Bobby [Robert] Kennedy.  And I had grown up being a fan of John [F.] Kennedy and Bob Kennedy especially because I was older; I campaigned for Robert Kennedy.  And I've always been, you know, interested in politics and fascinated, because you know, being on the street where Tom Bradley lived, and my parents [Frances Willard Smith Cloud and Hamilton Strawbridge Cloud], you know, knowing (coughing) some of the African American politicians.  I've always been fascinated by it and followed it, and been a fan of the Congresswoman since she was in the State Assembly and then made the move to Congress twenty-one years ago.  So, when this opportunity came to join her staff, I jumped at it.  And so, now I'm the Director of Special Projects.
Speaker 1: So when was that?  When did you--
Speaker 2: A little more than a year ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So April of 2010.  April 5th, 2010.  And, I'm now the Director of Special Projects for her.  So I do a lot of things that are, some of which are traditional staff projects, meaning I would advance (unclear) speaking engagements that she has to sometimes representing her in--I went to an event at Loyola College this past week where she was scheduled to speak at the opening of a (sic.) engineering lab [laboratory] that she had helped the college get some funding for, and at the last minute she had an emergency and couldn't go, and so I went in her stead and gave the remarks that she had planned to make.  So I will replace her on certain events, or if we're doing community meetings that need, you know, some production skills in terms of organizing them or involving--it's interesting that there's similarities between Washington [District of Columbia] politics and the entertainment universe.  You know, you have a star system and Biggie goes, and you're doing things for the public, you know.  Politicians aren't entertaining them, but they're interacting with them and addressing them.  You know, whether it's in meetings or larger events.  So, you know, if it requires putting some kind of multimedia presentation together or just helping organize an event in terms of, you know, deciding running order or writing intros.  So that's part of what I'll do.  You know, here in the office I help with the writing of certificates to other sort of normal field rep functions.  So, for example, I handle the airport, LAX [Los Angeles International Airport], because it's in our congressional district, and so, whenever there's airport issues or activities, I'm usually, if the Congresswoman isn't in town, I'm the representative from the office who will attend those or go to a meeting.  I also handle transportation.  So, there's a major train line that the metro system here in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] is going to be building; part of it underground, part of it at grade, part of it above ground, going right through the area where I happened to grow up, the Crenshaw Area, all the way out to LAX which, you know, I cover.  So, that's a natural for me to be part of that.  So, I attend neighborhood meetings and listen to what constituents are saying about those kinds of issues.  And then, Loyola because it's in our district; you know, I attend that or Southwest College if there are events there.  So, I'm really enjoying this job because of the experience.  I'm able to bring a lot of my experience to bear on the kinds of projects I'm doing now.
Story_ID: 40253
Speaker 1: And, one interesting story I should share that's a broader experiential thing.  I was not prepared for the ageism that exists in the entertainment business.  But one of the realities is, when you get some gray hair or they look at your resume and realize that you worked on 'Cheers' and 'Family Ties', and they start figuring out how old you are, they're a lot less [more?] reluctant to hire you.  And it's illogical because you would think experience and relationships would be very valuable, which I do think they are.  But in the entertainment business they tend to work against you, because very often the people who would be hiring you are younger, and they're either sometimes intimidated by somebody who has a lot of experience or they think you don't know what's happening in youth culture anymore because, "Oh.  Well, you're a graybeard, you know.  You don't know what's going on."  And I literally have found myself in job interviews where somebody will look at my resume and realize that I worked on some show when they were in elementary school.  And I'll see them glaze over, and I know I've lost the job because they are--you know, they don't want to hire you.  And I always think that that's so shortsighted because, even though I was a very young exec at NBC, I was in my twenties and became a vice president at twenty-eight I think, I always loved hearing the stories from the older generation of writers.  You know, they would tell me how they worked on 'I Love Lucy' or 'The Honeymooners' or, you know, early television shows; and I loved hearing those stories.  Or, "I worked with Tony Randall" for example or I mentioned Carol Burnett's company with Vicky Lawrence.  And to be able to listen from Harvey Korman, you know, or Joe Hamilton, who was Carol Burnett's husband.  I always found--or Maya Angelou, you know or any of my elders, I always found those interesting and always learned from them.  And so, I've found it very interesting that these days a lot of young people are reluctant to hire the older generation, you know, for reasons that don't make any sense to me.  But because ageism is such a real thing in the entertainment business it became harder and harder for me to get jobs after, you know, I had a good run with Montel [Williams].  I was with him for seven years.  But by then, I was crossing the fifty-yard line and, you know, you just are not relevant in the entertainment business, unless you've been an incredibly successful entrepreneur like Steven Spielberg or Ron Howard or somebody.  You are just not somebody that gets hired anymore to work at any of these companies.
Speaker 2: So that's increasingly the case?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Unfortunately.  I think--in fact, there was actually a class action lawsuit recently that the Writer's Guild filed, because older writers can't get hired.  Younger producers don't want to hire them, you know, unless they're doing--they happen to be doing a show about senior citizens.  But those are few and far between, and so--and I've seen this happen not just with my black contemporaries, but with all of my contemporaries in the entertainment business.  Most of the people I worked with cannot find employment anymore because we're--you know, you pass forty-five [years; age] and you're too old.
Speaker 2: Would you think that the reality show trend has something to do with that?
Speaker 1: It did.  I think so.  Yeah, especially because good writing--people who know how to craft a script were in less demand when reality took off because reality is cheaper to produce, and became very popular, and it started to replace scripted programming.  And it's interesting because I personally think that the pendulum is going to swing back and the scripted programming will come back.  But, because younger people are consuming television and media now much differently than we did, I don't know if it'll ever be the same.  I think reality will always be around because it is much less expensive to produce.  Not only because you don't have to have a large writing staff, but most of them are not represented by unions.  So, you know, a reality staffer, who they never call a writer, doesn't have to be paid anything.  You know, they're paid whatever they'll work for.  Same with the directors.  So, you're able to avoid the unions, and so the networks tend to love those programs; if they can get a rating, they'd much rather go with that than with a scripted programming, which might cost double, triple the cost; you know, quadruple the cost depending on the star power in a show.
Story_ID: 40254
Speaker 1: Now, as a businessman, the entertainment businesses' marrying (unclear) was going on in government.  They just had the big union--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: -struggle in Wisconsin when Governor [Scott] Walker was trying to get rid of the union employees--
Speaker 2: Yes,
Speaker 1: --and they--all over the country--
Speaker 2: All over the country.
Speaker 1: --(unclear)(simultaneous)the same thing.
Speaker 2: And you're seeing it in education where cities are trying to break their teachers' unions--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --Detroit's [Michigan] trying to break its auto unions.  And to me, it's shortsighted because the product definitely suffers.  I think that there is and has to be a happy medium, that maybe unions had gotten too far--they had helped make things too expensive not only with salaries but with benefits; but at the same time, to eliminate unions and benefits, which some companies and governments are trying to do, the product will definitely suffer.  I--you know, charter schools is an example.  I don't think it can ever be as good as schools that have good union teachers and parent involvement.  Charter schools happen to have a lot of parental involvement because the parents have been proactive about taking their kids out of public schools and putting them in charter schools.  And sometimes they have some good teachers because they're young and hungry and aggressive, but the teachers--my understanding is that the teachers burn out and leave those schools, you know, after three or four years because, you know, they're working really hard and know they're underpaid, and have no benefits, and no retirement or anything.  So they end up leaving.  So, I hope that the country is able to find a happy medium.  But, yeah, you're absolutely right.  What has been happening in the entertainment business is now, you know, spreading from the left coast to the rest of the country.  And I hope the ageism--but I do think the ageism is happening in other industries, too, because this recession has shown us that a lot of older workers who get laid off have a much harder time finding employment because they are assumed--it's assumed that they don't have the energy; it's assumed that they are out of touch with the culture; and that they want more money; and they certainly want benefits because, yeah, we're smarter and we know that we deserve those things.  But that doesn't mean we couldn't do a job that's twice as good as a younger person because we have the experience and the connections, you know.  I saw in the music industry how literally one record label laid off all of its--well, first it offered all its employees over the age of fifty early retirement, and then if they didn't take it they were laid off, like a year or two later with, you know, no benefits.  And I remember thinking at the time, "That is incredibly shortsighted."  When it's a business or relationships and the experienced, you know, recognizing new talent, but their assumption was, "Oh, the music business is changing, the music is changing; so an older exec isn't going to be in touch with this new music, and therefore has no value."  I think they're wrong, and I think that that did lead to the downfall of the music business.  I personally think that it did, but they would argue, "Oh, no, it was all the digital universe that led to that downfall."  But, you know, it's what's going on.
Story_ID: 40255
Speaker 1: And having this job now with the Congresswoman [Maxine Waters] and seeing these things up close and how the government does react or not react is really interesting, because things are moving so much faster and it's so much more about imaging and messaging and short attention spans, and how people are getting their news from the Internet now, you know.  Not only are they not reading newspapers, they're not watching television news as much as they used to.  They're now getting it in these Internet bits where, you know, they're clicking on something, and so, they're not even hearing or reading about something that they aren't already interested in, you know.  So, unless they just happen to see it pop up on their screen, they don't necessarily follow news.  Congresswoman Waters--this is something I thought about driving in today.  Of all the really interesting people I've worked with, I've never worked with anyone who works as hard as she does.  She works seven days a week, fifty or fifty-one weeks out of the year and goes nonstop.  She commutes back and forth from L.A. [Los Angeles, California] to Washington, D.C. [District of Columbia]. And, I knew she worked hard before coming to work for her, but now that I'm part of the staff and we have to keep up with her, and working with her on weekends, it is amazing to see how hard she works.
Speaker 2: Because she keep a national--high national profile, and a lot of people feel that she represents them even though she's in California.
Speaker 1: Yes.  That's a really good point.  And, you know, it's interesting.  She doesn't cultivate that.  It happened sort of naturally because she's interested in issues that do--you know, she's interested in New Orleans [Louisiana].  She grew up in Saint Louis [Missouri].  And we get phone calls every day from people who are not in our district; whether they're in Los Angeles, California, the nation, and internationally, who are calling because they think of her as their representative (laughter).  And it's--when we explain the rules that, "Well, you know, we really can't do anything for you because you're not in the 35th District of California," they're surprised and disappointed.  And that doesn't mean she doesn't try to help them, but we can't devote staff time to helping them, you know.  She'll do that on her own.  And then sometimes we'll just refer them to somebody, to either their own representative or to some other organization locally that can help them.  But, yeah, she does have that profile as being--we laughingly call her, you know, America's Congressperson.  And there are people who also dislike her from all over the country.  We get some really disturbing faxes on our fax machine almost daily, because people--there are people who don't like the great job she does, you know, representing what we call have-nots, you know; black people, brown people, and poor people in general; whether it's in health or financial reform, you know.  This thing that's going on with the foreclosures on homes from home loans, she's been a major advocate for trying to prevent the banks from taking advantage of all these people that they've suckered into making, you know, taking out these loans that there was no way they could pay them back.  So, you have senior citizens who are losing their loans--it's really, really sad and scary, and she's one of the few voices out there saying, "Wait a minute, wait a minute," (laughter) you know.
Story_ID: 40256
Speaker 1: Now, let me ask you this, and I think we're going to get into this-
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: -as I get toward my last questions.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there a major thing that you would do differently now if you could?
Speaker 2: Wow.  That's a great question.  What I'd do differently.  I may have taken more time to plan the course that I've taken.  I've been very, very lucky in that I'm usually not thinking about my next job, and I have never laid out a master plan of what I wanted to be doing when I was forty or fifty [years old].  And I've sort of entrusted that to the spirits and the Higher Power to lead me to interesting things.  And before I came to this job, I was well paid, you know, in the entertainment industry.  I was well paid.  So, I always felt very fortunate to be doing what I was doing, and I would jokingly say, "I wonder what I'm going to do when I grow up?"  You know, and then you pass fifty and you realize, "Oh, okay.  Maybe I am doing it or I'd better decide soon."  And when my dad [Hamilton Strawbridge Cloud] was ill, my dad had congestive heart failure, and I took about a year off from working to help take care of him.  And he had a great wife who was not my mom [Frances Willard Smith Cloud], it was his second wife, who really loved him and devoted a lot of time and energy to taking care of him, because he was twenty-five years older than she was.  And when he really--he had heart disease, had a couple of heart attacks, and then he started to have congestive heart failure.  So when we were taking care of him, we were in and out of the hospital twelve times in nine months.  And we, meaning his wife, her sister and myself, we stayed with him twenty-four hours a day because my dad, having been a doctor of dental surgery, and a lot of doctors in our universe, family friends, we knew how the medical profession is not perfect, you know.  They don't know much more than what they share with us and what we read on-line and so on.  So, they drop the ball a lot in hospitals, and we stayed with my dad twenty-four hours a day every time he was in the hospital.  And the point to this story is because I was always asking "intelligent" questions of the doctors and the nurses, they would frequently ask me if I was a doctor.  And so, in those times when my dad was asleep and I'd have a chance to be reflecting on things, I came to wonder why I didn't take that path.  People would all often ask me, "Why didn't you become a dentist like your dad?"  And I'd laugh because it never occurred to me (laughter).  I never thought about it, for a heartbeat.  And when I was in the hospital with my dad, I realized maybe I could have been a doctor or a dentist or a nurse.  And at one point I thought, "Okay.  If I can't have an entertainment career anymore, maybe I should become a nurse."  And then someone said to me, "Well, you know, you could never get a loan to go to nursing school, let alone medical school because you're too old."  And that realization was pretty shocking, because I realized they were right, and I had never thought about that and how unfair that was.  But the banks were thinking, "Okay.  He's got to have a twenty-five year career to pay off this loan or at least a twenty-year career to pay off this loan."  And at my age I'm not going to have a twenty-year career.  So I couldn't go to nursing school even if I wanted to.  If I could afford to pay for it, but I would never be able to borrow the money to be able to do it.  So back to your question.  I guess if I would do anything differently, it might be to have put a little thought and energy into planning and thinking about retirement or what I was going to be doing at what age.  I wish, for example, when I was working in the part of the industry where I was making a lot money, that I had had mentors who would have told me to buy real estate or buy stock or whatever.  I'm very fortunate, I did buy my home, you know, in '83 (1983) and still have it and it has appreciated, you know, quite a bit, and I couldn't afford to buy it today for sure.  But, I didn't buy the vacant lot that I thought about buying, you know, that would have quadrupled in value.  I didn't buy the apartment building who a buddy had tried to talk me into buying or I haven't, you know, really created the retirement plans or I didn't buy the Apple stock, you know, or any of those things that, when you look up at my age, I'm fifty-eight [years] now, you realize, "Oh, I really need to start thinking about these things because maybe I do only have twenty years now."
Story_ID: 40257
Speaker 1: Let me ask me you this.  It sounds like you don't have enough time anyway to do all of the things you want to do.  But--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --when you look back on everything you have done, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Wow.  I once told Nina Shaw, my attorney, I said, "Nina, I don't want the [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)] Image Awards to be the peak of my career."  And she said, "Oh, you don't have to worry about that.  That's not going to be the peak of your career."  But I do wonder if--you know, there are definitely things that I still intend to do, whether it's in the universe of politics or entertainment or some other paths that I might be led down.  But at least now, for now, the Image Awards probably would be at the head of the bio just because national television shows for thirteen, fourteen years.  And so, I'm very proud of that legacy, but all of these projects that I've shared stories about, I'm proud of all of them.  And I realize that early on before I was bitten by the bug, whether it was my mom [Frances Willard Smith Cloud] taking me to the shoots around L.A. [Los Angeles, California] or walking into the radio station, I was thinking, or when in junior high school when I was on the stage crew and did the lighting for, you know, we would do our versions of Broadway musicals; and I remember loving the--what's the saying, "The roar of the greasepaint, the smell of the crowd," you know; that being painting the set while they're rehearsing the play.  There's no better universe than that.  And my love of music and all of those things that I think I've always wanted to be a teacher.  And so, along the way, I taught at L.A. City College [LACC] and at Long Beach State [California State University, Long Beach], and I've always guest lectured in different places, and it--broadcasting and entertainment are a way of teaching a larger universe.  And I think that's why I've always consciously or unconsciously wanted to have a message in whatever I'm doing.  You know, I've had opportunities to go produce a game show or, you know, some, what I call, silly piece of entertainment that--and why I'm not a big fan of reality shows, that doesn't contribute to the culture at all; doesn't advance anybody's knowledge or anybody's awareness or wisdom or doesn't make their lives better in any way.  You know, it's a way to spend an half an hour, and I guess to get away from something.  And there's a value to that.  I mean, I love baseball because it's a place you can go and forget about everything else and all you're worrying about is the batter and the hitter.  But I think that teaching whether it's literally, you know, teaching proteges or students in the classroom or the audience at home, has been what I've unconsciously been doing and want to continue doing.
Story_ID: 40258
Speaker 1: If you got an ideal project to work on, and you had all the resources you needed to complete it, what would you do?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know if it would be a single project, but I--for example, I have movie projects, musical theatre projects, book projects, and political things that I would love to see happen, you know, while I'm still around, right.  But, an overall thesis for me has been, one, I think black folks are amazing, and it's amazing that we're still here and not all crazy and angry given what we've been through.  And I think that our greatest asset, and I haven't been a real student of history, but I do know that wars and development of countries have always been about natural resources; whether it's about oil or gold or land or whatever.  And in thinking about that, and I never did it in a formal way, but it occurred to me somewhere along the way that our, meaning black folk's greatest natural resource, has always been our talent.  Whether it's on the athletic field, as actors, as comedians, as writers, and especially as musicians, dancers; our talent is our greatest natural resource.  And we've entertained not only America, but the world; you know, the jazz ambassadors from, you know, Dizzy [Gillespie], and Louie [Armstrong], and [Duke] Ellington, and Quincy [Jones], and Michael Jackson, and Prince, and Jimmy Hendrix, and Ella [Fitzgerald], and Sarah [Vaughan], and Carmen [McRae], and Billie Holiday, and--that natural resource I've always felt is our greatest wealth.  And if we could ever figure out to gain control over it, and manage it, and package it, and present it, and reap the rewards from it, that's our gold; that's our oil; that's our diamond.  Because, here we are in the second decade of the twenty-first century and we still don't own an automobile company.  You know, we might own a couple of hotels.  Maybe there's an air--maybe Bob Johnson owns an airline.  You know, here we are in this point in history and it's amazing how much we don't own, but what we do own and we've always owned is, you know, and we all know the names, Kobe Bryant and LeBron James right now, you know, there's nothing else like them in the world or like a Michael Jackson or a Prince or, you know, an Alicia Keys or whoever it may be; Chaka Khan or an Aretha Franklin.  That is our gold.  And so, everything that I've done consciously or unconsciously has been to try to help organize, and package, and present that natural resource.  And I've watched it go from a period of very little African American representation of any of that natural resource, whether it was just talent agents or managers or lawyers or accountants, to--you know, you're finally seeing a change where black folks are trusting each other enough.  And there're enough folks with experience and knowledge to know how to do those things, and the people skills to be able to operate in those universes that, I always say that I hope to live long enough to see the day when we have control over that natural resource.
Story_ID: 40259
Speaker 1: I'm sorry--another quick story that I have to share.  My nephew, who I mentioned coming to the [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)] Image Awards rehearsals and asking me who some of these people were; one day he was asking me, "How do all these crappy black movies get made?"  And I won't mention any names, but I started to explain to him how movies get made; you know, first you get the idea, the writer, the producer, the director.  At one point--and I said that the money comes from the studios, and he said, "Hold up, hold up.  Let me ask you a question."  And he was eighteen or nineteen [years old] at the time I think.  He said, "You mean you have to go to white people to get the money to make these movies?"  And it was like he had kicked me in the stomach.  And this was right around the first part of the twenty-first century, and I thought, "Wow."  You know, from the mouths of babes.  "He's right."  Here we are in the twenty-first century, and the way the system works, we still have to go convince somebody else that this idea has value, and will be commercial, and will make money, and is important, because we don't have the money to do it; even though we know it would be all of those things.  And so, ever since then my goal has been to try to bridge the gap.  Because he said to me, "I know there's black writers, and black directors, and black producers, and black talent, and I know there's black people with money.  So, how come--how come that doesn't happen?"  And for me that was the epiphany where I said, "Okay.  I want to spend the rest of my life trying to bridge that gap and put those universes in touch with each other so that black money trusts black talent enough to invest in it and--because there's always horror stories about people who've lost money in Hollywood and get taken--it happens all the time and every day, and it'll continue to happen.  But, there's now a universe of size that know what they're doing and want to do meaningful product to leave behind that will change the planet that, hopefully, those universes will come together.  And it won't just be black money, you know.  It'll be white money, and Middle Eastern money, and Asian money; wherever the money comes from, because we know there're so many incredible stories that have not been told yet that will benefit not just black America, but the whole planet because they're inspiring, they're dramatic, they're educational, they are meaningful, thought provoking, etcetera.
Story_ID: 40260
Speaker 1: And so, my biggest frustration, and yet my biggest hope, is that I'll be around long enough to help bridge that gap so that we are able to make products that--every producer will tell you they've got the products in their desk drawer that they know are good, that they know are commercial, and valuable, and would be a hit if they had the wherewithal to bring them to fruition.  But we are out there pitching them usually to money sources that don't have a clue what we're talking about, either because it's not their story, not their universe, not their experience or they don't think anybody else is going to be interested.  And Montel [Williams] and I, for example, we would pitch stories that we knew were fantastic, and we couldn't sell them because they "happen to be about black people."  And the color didn't have anything to do with--I'll never forget, we pitched a story to MTV [Music Television] about a young guy, true story and I won't tell you the whole story, but they literally asked us in the movie, "Well, were there any white people in this story?"  And, you know, we told them the truth and we said, "No, not really.  We could create some characters if you want, but the real story is dramatic enough."  And they felt that unless there were some white people in this story the audience would not come to the party.  And so, you end up with projects like the Steve Biko movie that I'm going to blank on the name--that Denzel Washington did, which was told through the viewpoint of the young white reporters--
Speaker 2: Right.  'Dry White Season' or are you talking about the other one?
Speaker 1: No.  It wasn't 'Dry White Season'.  I can't believe I'm going to blank on the title of it.  But, when you see--and irony is when the critics wrote about it, even the critics said, "Why are they telling this story about these reporters?  This is--Denzel's the story."  You know, "It's the Steve Biko story."  But, the "powers that be" who paid the money to have the project produced thought that, that general market audiences would not find that story compelling enough unless it was told through the viewpoint of the white characters.  And so--
Speaker 2: 'Last Samurai' has a white man (unclear)
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 2: Almost all of those.
Speaker 1: And there's a lot of examples we could come up with.  And so, I'm hoping that I'm around long enough to be able to present the stories that I have in the desk drawer, and that I know a lot of other people have in their desk drawers.  Because, you know, we pitch--you'll hear stories pitched that--I--literally, I try--when I was at NBC, I was pitched the 'Tuskegee Airmen Story', based on the same book that eventually got made.  But I couldn't interest anybody in making the movie.  I was pitched 'The Dorothy Dandridge Story', the same book that Halle Berry eventually optioned and turned into a big hit for HBO.  But they said to me when I pitched it, they said, "Well, who's going to play Dorothy Dandridge?"  And I was like--at the time I said, "Well, Diane Carroll or," I said, "You know, there's a lot of people."  But because that universe wasn't "big enough" for big stars.  You know, 'Tuskegee' got made because [Lawrence] Fishburne and some of those guys had become big enough stars, and HBO--thank goodness for HBO, because they don't have to worry about ratings every day, and they're willing to roll the dice, and they know, by the way--and this is another interesting thing; even when I was at Playboy [Entertainment Group], I once asked them, "Do you know how many black people are watching your network?"  And they had no idea.  And so, they did research and found out that 25 percent of their audience was African American, and that blew their minds.  And the same thing at NBC, they had no idea how many black people were watching their network.  HBO does know.  And I know the number is somewhere between 20 and 25 percent of the people who write a check every month to get HBO are African Americans.  And so, they're not afraid to do those stories, and they know that they're great dramatic stories that a broad audience is going to be interested in.
Story_ID: 40261
Speaker 1: And so, this is a very frustrating time in Hollywood right now because African Americans are like, we feel like dinosaurs; we're disappearing, because, you know, there used to be a lot of black sitcoms.  Tyler Perry is it now.  Well, one or two are now starting to happen again; L.L. Cool J's show and, but, you know, the days of 'Cosby [Show]' and 'A Different World', and 'Family Matters', and, you know, all those others-'Two-Two-Seven', and 'The Jeffersons', and all those great shows, they're all gone.  And when people try to figure out, well, how come, the heads of the networks have literally said, "We don't want to do those shows any more.  We'd rather integrate the casts of our all ready existing shows than do a show about a black family."  And again, it's like, "Well, why?  America watched 'Family Matters,' America watched 'The Cosby Show.'"  But that is the conventional wisdom right now.  And so, again, I'm hoping to be around long enough to not only survive this dip that we're in, but to bridge this gap so that the funding sources are coming from all over the world, and all these incredible stories that remain to be told can be told.
Story_ID: 40262
Speaker 1: Now, are you--I have to ask this quick question because of where we are now.  Have you--have you considered a career in politics?  Are you, you know--
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  No, I have not mainly because I realize--because people will ask me that.  And very often politicians will come out of the staffs of other politicians, you know; a lot of our local Californian politicians who are staff members for Congresswoman [Maxine] Waters or other people.  I realize that I am much more of a behind-the-scenes person.  I'd rather be the aide, you know, who helps them craft their image; the same way I was never--and these analogies are not really fair, but I never was interested in being an actor.  I would have loved to have been a musician, but I never wanted to be an actor.  I'd much rather be the producer or the director or the writer.  And that's not to say politicians are actors, but I think that the really good politicians like Congresswoman Waters have a skill that I could never do.  You know, they really are good at what they do when it comes to interacting and thinking on their feet, and the politics of it all; the compromise, the dealing with people who disagree with you, you know, the way that they have to.  They don't do it as much as they used to in Washington as we all know; that the Republicans and Democrats, you know, it's like this now (hitting fists together); whereas it used to be like this (patting hands together).  So no, I don't think I would.  People have said to me, "Well, you know, you have this great name and from your radio shows there are people out there who know you in town, and everybody who meets you, you know, thinks favorably; so, you should think about it.  And I'm very comfortable knowing that I don't really--I think I could be good at it, but I don't really have--I don't I could be great at it.  And there have been too many great ones that, you know--for example, I've been watching the 'Kennedy' miniseries recently and, you know, there're too many of the other great politicians.  I don't think I could that.  I watched--I got to watch Tom Bradley quite a bit, you know.  (unclear), so now, certainly, Jesse Jackson is one of my idols; and now, you know, Cory Booker and Patrick Deval, and obviously President [Barack] Obama.  I think that they are people who are much better that--I'd much rather be part of their team and help them keep an eye on the forest, you know, while they have to deal with the trees every day.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)
Story_ID: 40263
Speaker 1: Do you help Congress[wo]man [Maxine] Waters keep track of all the news that goes down and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you know, there--I know from time to time she appears on some of the cable shows--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and late news shows and--
Speaker 2: We have a great staff, and so, all of us whether it's our communications people in [Washington] D.C. [District of Columbis], or the people out here or our chief-of-staff in D.C., we're all monitoring the media as best we can.  And so, yes, we keep her--she's a news junkie herself.  She literally keeps CNN or another news channel on, you know, when she's at home all the time.  But the great thing is, we come from different universes, and so, while somebody might be reading the financial press, and I'm keeping with the entertainment press, and somebody is just following foreign policy, and somebody else is following the housing markets.  So, we keep her abreast of things on a daily basis, on an hourly basis, you know.  Half the time she's already ahead of us (laughter).  But, you know, if somebody's passed and she hasn't heard about it yet, you know, we'll make sure she knows, because very often she wants to send a condolence because she knew them or do something like that.  So that is a large part.  And a large part of what we do out here in the district office is keeping our ears to the grapevines, and hearing what people are talking about, and what's happening out there.  So, you know, right now, whether it's jobs or foreclosures or--for example, one of the major issues I worked on was the NBC-Comcast merger.  And so, I was part of the team that really helped get her up to speed on a lot of the intricacies of the television industry so that she would understand what this merger meant, you know, and whether it was a positive thing or not.  And, I think she was even shocked to realize how bad things had become in the industry and are right now.  So, the role that she played in that merger, she was never opposed to it but she wanted to make sure that at the end of the day Comcast was aware of the frustrations of the creative community in Hollywood, and was willing to do some substantive things to try to improve the landscape.  And, you know, hopefully, she did play a role in that happening.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 40264
Speaker 1: We always ask a question about your concerns for the African American community.  I think you've addressed a lot of them already since, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think I have.
Speaker 1: --in the terms of your own field, you were talking about the lack of ownership being so critical to what we're doing.  We just saw Keith Olbermann quit MSNBC--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and give a current TV another network that has this--a similar point of view that he has.  We have black networks that, I don't know how, if you can say they're really focused on black history or not.
Speaker 2: Yeah they're--a lot of us were frustrated with BET [Black Entertainment Television], you know, because it existed for fifteen years before the country was even aware of their existence.  And we still have hopes that it turns into a real network.  And now that TV One exists, to give it some competition, and now with Comcast, hopefully, as part of its merger with NBC committed to create some more networks, because that competition is healthy and, you know, one network shouldn't have to carry the burden of being everything for all black people, you know.  Obviously, we are diverse enough amongst ourselves to have different kinds of networks.  So, I do hope that as those come to exist, there will be broader platforms to expose, whether it's a core audience or a broader audience, to more of what black culture is about.  And, my biggest concern for Black America right now is, and I get to see it every day, you know, working with the Congresswoman [Maxine Waters], is that so many of our young people have given up, have no desire--and that's why I give myself the same criticism; they aren't thinking about anything beyond next week.  And I talked to some of the young folks that we interact with on a regular basis, and I'll say, "So, tell me, what do young people talk about and think about now?"  Because I don't see, you know--and I blame the media because the media spoon feeds them, and black radio is not what it used to be and, you know, if we aren't reading newspapers or getting it from television news, which does a pretty bad job, how are black folks even in touch with what's going on in the world, you know?  And they need to know what's happening in Africa and in the Caribbean.  And instead of being absorbed with news about the scandalous things--and my dad [Hamilton Strawbridge Cloud] used to say this all the time; it's a, he says, "Always pay attention.  When there's a scandal, always look in the other direction because that means something is going on that they don't want us to be paying attention to, you know."  They want us to be absorbed with Charlie Sheen when we should be paying attention to what's happening in Israel or the Middle East, you know, and Syria and Libya and Egypt.  And black people, we get caught up in the same B.S.; so we're too busy worrying about, you know, Michael and Eddie and O.J., and, you know, whatever the scandal may be of the moment, and having the latest clothes and, you know, a pair of Nikes, instead of how are we going to leave the planet better off than what we found it, you know; how are we going to make it better for our own offspring and everybody else.  And, it's financial, you know, it's business, it's creative; and it all stems from education.
Story_ID: 40265
Speaker 1: But I'll tell you what does give me hope is, I see every now and then examples of things again that I never thought would happen in my lifetime.  One of my dad's [Hamilton Strawbridge Cloud] wife's nephews came out of USC [University of Southern California] as a computer whiz, and he got signed by Electronics Arts, by EA, and got a signing bonus to come work for them out of college.  And I remembered being so impressed that a black person was getting a signing bonus who wasn't an athlete, you know.  He was coming out because he has skills that are valuable and they were hiring him, not through an affirmative action program or because they were worried about being diverse, but because he knows how to do that stuff.  And he's already thinking in ways that I never thought of, you know.  He's thinking about buying real estate and what he's going to be doing and, I think he's left the company now and is out on his own making more money than he was making with the company because he knows that universe.  And so, that gives me hope.  I just hope that that can be translated to a larger universe as a people because the--and again, you know, we all know this stuff, but we can't all be NBA [National Basketball Association] players, but we can be managers, and lawyers, and accountants of NBA players.  And we can help educate their kids and, you know, we can't all be movie stars, but we can be in that larger universe that takes that black movie star and writes a movie for them, and produces it, and directs it, and markets it, and owns the movie theatre that it plays in, and the newspaper that it advertises in, and all those kinds of things.  So, I just hope that as a people we can--the stat [statistic] that depresses me the most is, and I heard this when I was doing the [Muhammad] Ali thing, the Ali opening; and it explained so much for me, is this stat that the average net worth of an African American is one-tenth the average net worth of an Anglo American.  And when you think about that reality, it explains so much because, you know, for every dollar that they're making, we're making a dime.  So, it explains why we're poor, why we don't have the money to finance a lot of things, why we're playing catch-up and will continue to be.  But I don't think anybody would argue that we're one-tenth as talented, one-tenth as smart; you know, one-tenth as creative.  We know that's not the case.  So, something else has been at work from, you know, 1865 'til now that has caused that gap to get greater and greater and greater.  And, just that knowledge, just knowing that that's the reality, and we have to figure out ways to address that gap, I think, will be helpful in people realizing, "Okay.  I need to go to school, I need to learn whatever the language is that I'm going to be dealing in both literally and figuratively," you know, whether it's an engineering language, computer language, or Spanish or French or an African language or Chinese or whatever that our young people can figure out that nobody's going to give it to them, that they can't be--they can't make a loud enough noise to get it any other way than working for it.  And I hope that--because when I think about my grandfather's work ethic, the postal carrier [maternal grandfather, Neil Smith], and the photographer [paternal grandfather, Frank Herman Cloud]; and my grandmothers' [Mary Ellen Jarrett Smith (maternal) and Lillian Strawbridge (paternal)] work ethics, who, even though they were homemakers, they worked their tails off to raise kids, and feed them, and clothe them, and send them to school, help them with their homework; they worked their behinds off.  When I think of that work ethic, that's the thing that I'm most afraid of, is that we're losing that somehow.  That our younger generation thinks it's supposed to be easy.  And nobody told us it was supposed to be easy, and it's never going to be easy.  And so, we don't wake up every morning thinking about, "Okay.  What am I going to do today to make myself better, my life better, my kids' lives better, and the planet better," then we're wasting time.  I think, and I'm sorry to--but, every day I think, God has kept me from dying many times for a reason.  And if it's not to make the planet better, I don't know what it is.  And I hope that other people think the same way; that you're here for a reason, and if you aren't figuring it out and figuring out how to leave more behind than what you're consuming, then you're just wasting time.

Speaker 1: Tell us about your family.  Now, you got a daughter [Anju Cloud].  Is she in school or--
Speaker 2: Yes.  I have a thirteen-year-old daughter who is in public school.  As I was a product of public school, I have a lot of faith in it.  It's not as easy as it used to be, so she's going to a school outside of our district.  But we were really lucky that we had a public elementary school that was three blocks from our house.  So we were able to walk her to school all the way through the sixth grade.  Now we have to drive her because it's in another part of town, but she's in a public middle school.  She wants to be a dancer, which I think comes from my mom [Frances Willard Smith Cloud]; and she's really good and loves ballet, tap, Hawaiian, and modern.  And she's very smart, and very popular, and I couldn't be prouder of her.  And a lot of it comes from my wife [Fukue Yamaguchi], who's also, you know, very smart and very talented; plays the piano, could've had any number of careers.  She was a legal secretary, but she could've been a piano teacher; she could have been an interpreter, could've been a television correspondent, and hopefully, will still explore some of those areas.  She works at the public television station in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] right now, and she also worked as my assistant for the last four years of the [National Association for the Advancement of Colored people (NAACP)] Image Awards, and was the best assistant I ever had because she's so thorough and organized.  I'm the opposite.  I'm organized up here, but it doesn't necessarily represent itself in the office space.  But she's incredibly well organized.  So my daughter has the best of both of those things, and she and I drive my wife a little crazy because we're a little more lax on everything going back into its prescribed space, but we do know where it all is.  But she has my wife's musical talent and even some of the dancing I think comes from that side, and certainly her language skills and all of that.  So, we're very proud of her and, yes, she literally wants to go to Broadway and dance in New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, your parents [Frances Willard Smith Cloud and Hamilton Strawbridge Cloud] still around?
Speaker 2: No. Both of my parents are gone.  I lost my mom one year--right in the middle of the Image Awards; she had a stroke, and she was living in Hilton Head, North Carolina.  And I got a phone call on a Monday afternoon and jumped on the plane, and she was gone by the time I got there.  She did get to meet my daughter, who was just a year old I think at the time, less than a year old.  And then I lost my dad about five years ago, because he had heart disease.  He made it--my mom was seventy-two [years old] and my dad made it to eighty-five.  And, as I think I mentioned, one of my grandfathers made it to 100.  And another--my dad's mom [Lillian Strawbridge] made it to ninety-eight.  So we do have some longevity along with some heart disease and diabetes and some other things.  But I hope I end up with the longer genes, if I'm lucky.  But, yeah, they're both gone now.
Speaker 1: And you've got two sisters?
Speaker 2: Yes, two sisters.  One in Altadena [California] and one in Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: Is there anything I haven't asked you about that we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Not that I can think--I'm sure I'll think of something driving home, but I don't think so.
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, the last question is similar to legacy, but a little different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I hope I'll be remembered as somebody who was a good dad, and a good husband, and a good teacher, both literally and in the broader sense that I talked about; that tried to make the planet a better place whether it was through personal friendships which I've been very lucky to have, you know, with really good friends along the way, to that broader sense of exposing not only black folks; and with my daughter [Anju Cloud], who will get to choose what she wants to be.  If you saw my daughter, you know, some people think she looks just like my wife, some people think she looks Latino, Filipino; so she will get to be whatever she wants to be.  And I always find it interesting that in her head, there's no doubt she's black.  That's her approach to life; she's black and she's Japanese, and she's very comfortable with that.  And I'm very happy about that, and I try not to burden her with too much of our history in the negative sense.  I want her to know our history in the positive sense; to know where we come from and what makes us what we are and how amazing we are a people, but I don't want her to necessarily carry the baggage that some of us have that causes us to limit ourselves or assume we won't be welcomed or can't do something or we'll always have to overcome.  I mean, I want her to know that she may have to work harder, because she is going to be prejudged because coming in the room she's definitely a colored person.  But I want it to be--when she was five years old, she said to me, and this blew our minds; she said, "Dad, how come so many of the homeless people are black?"  And we were like, "How is she even aware of that?"  But--and I'm still struggling to really answer that question for her.  But I don't want her to--I want her to be aware that, yes, there are factors that cause that to be the case, but I don't her to feel like that's more likely to happen to her because she's black.  So, I want that legacy in the personal sense, and then I guess on the larger stage, I hope to leave behind work that people--and this has already happened--that people loved the radio shows I did, or loved the television shows I did, or the book projects I was involved in, and the motion picture projects I was involved in; and, hopefully, whether it's musicals, or politicians that I've worked with, or programs that I helped create that, you know, whether it's a community program--because I'm working with a lot of different community organizations now; that I helped expand people's horizons to really be, maybe the Army slogan, you know, to be more than they would have been otherwise; and that's what will make me happy, you know, when it's time to go.
Speaker 1: All right.  Thank you.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Thanks for sharing with us.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 40268
Speaker 1: Just tell us about this.
Speaker 2: Sure, this is a picture of me.  I assume I was probably two years old--somewhere between two and three; so it would have been '54 (1954), '55 (1955).  And the reason I thought it was significant and worth sharing is, one, it was taken by my [paternal] grandfather, Frank Cloud, who was the professional photographer; and two, I thought it was such a prophetic image because that's probably where my love of radio began, was literally at that age listening to that radio in my parents' [Frances Willard Smith Cloud and Hamilton Strawbridge Cloud] house.
Speaker 1: Looks like you're having a good time too.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right.  Next.
Speaker 2: And--okay.  You tell me when you're ready.
Speaker 1: Ready.
Speaker 2: So this one I brought to show you because that's my paternal grandfather, Frank Cloud, who was the professional photographer; and that's me, obviously as--probably under one, maybe about one years old.  And it was out in front of his studio on Western Avenue, one of the first professional black photography studios in Los Angeles [California] if not the first.  So it probably was 1953 or nine--yeah, at the most, 1954.  And my grandfather and my father had been estranged, because when my grandfather was run out of Birmingham [Alabama], they literally didn't see each other for years--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --and so, it was really significant that my grandfather was coming back into my father's life, and that we were able to have a relationship with him.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
