Speaker 1: Dr. Strudwick, would you please tell us a little bit about your mother, starting with her name, where she was born and where she grew up, that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Okay, my mother's name was Mabel Christina Wormley.  She was born Washington, D.C.  And the exact date, I, I can't tell you, it was in January, though, and it was in the late '80s [1880s].  She was a very industrial, artistic lady.  She was a teacher.  She went to school in Washington, D.C.  She graduated from what is, was known as Minor Teachers College.  And she went through the two-year program, I guess, and became a teacher.  And at that time, I think, with the teacher's certificate, she could not teach in Washington, D.C.  I think she could teach elsewhere.  And so she wanted probably to get a, more education, but in doing that, and to make some money, she went South.  She went South to Durham, North Carolina.  In Durham, North Carolina, she met my father [William Canady Strudwick].
Speaker 1: Did you mother ever share any stories with you about her growing up, what life was like for her growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, she said that, you know, Washington, D.C. at that time was a nice place to live and all, and she enjoyed it.  And she left somewhat with trepidations, I think.  She was leaving her home.  She was going by herself.  She was going South.  She was very close--I don't know how close, to her father.  Her father was a soldier in the Civil War.  He was for the North side, and he was ill, and he was in a veterans' hospital in Virginia.  Exactly where that was, I do not know.  I have a letter, I don't know where it is, it's--I know where it is, downstairs.  I'd have to go look for it.  But anyway, that she had written to him.  And a letter that he had written to her.  Now, whether he wrote it or someone wrote it for him, I don't know, but anyway, it's a very nice letter, you know, between the two of them, you know.  She--.
Speaker 1: How would--.
Speaker 2: She--I don't know exactly, I guess, how she met my father.  But anyway, Durham was a small Southern town, and here's this young lady coming down, you know, from Washington, D.C. and hanging on to him cause she used to tell me (chuckle)--it's a little funny, "There's that hussy from Washington down here and, (laughter) and married this doctor, you know, (laughter) this young doctor in Washington, D.C."  But anyway, she became a North Carolinian really in Durham, and she stayed there because in her later years, I tried to get her to come back here after my father died.  My father died when I was very young [1932].  And I tried to get her to come back to Washington to stay.  She said, no, this is my home.  I've spent most of my life here, and I'm gonna remain here.
Speaker 1: How would you describe your mother?
Speaker 2: In what way?  She was a very beautiful lady, and she was very religious.  And she--in my early life, I was a churchgoer.  I went to church each and every Sunday.  I went to Sunday school each and every Sunday because of my mother, and I was a choir boy.  I took care of the choir--the books in the choir and all, all through early--late elementary school and high school.  I was a very good friend of the preacher's son who was also a choir boy.  So the two of us took care of the choir.  Now, I was not a saint (laughter), period.
Story_ID: 13695
Speaker 1: Now, let's talk a little bit about your father, starting with his name, where he grew up and where he was born?
Speaker 2: Okay.  His name was William Canady Strudwick.  Now, where he got both names, I do not know.  The William and the Canady, I have no idea, except for the fact that the name William, when you look through the Strudwicks on the computer, you see a lot of Williams, and it may be they just picked that up.  Canady, I have no idea about.  Strudwick, I think it came from the plantation owners, I suppose.  I don't think Strudwick is an African name, as such, so this is the only way that I can say it came about.  He, as far as I knew--my daddy died when I was eight years old [1932].  I have very few recollections of what he was like.  I do know that he was very good to me and certainly, I remember that very well.  He was a disciplinarian and my mama [Mabel Christina Wormley] used to say, well, I'll tell your daddy when he comes home what you did, you know.  And I was scared, but anyway, he was not the one who would give me the whipping.  I had to go outside and get the switch from the hedges and my mama would do the whipping (laughter) for whatever I had done wrong, you know (laughter).  But anyway, I remember he was flamboyant and an immaculate dresser.  I don't remember ever seeing my daddy in what one would call work clothes.  He always had on a suit and tie and cuff links and all, and he--and I guess in those days, doctors were that way.  They, and that's what I remember.  I remember he liked cards too.  We were in a black neighborhood, in which everybody, you were either poor, middle class or what one would call well-off black, you know.  And so we were well off as blacks go in that--in fact, we had two cars as I remember.  Prior to that time, I was told that he used to make his house calls in a wagon, you know, horse and wagon.  We had a barn behind our house.  I can remember that, the little barn, and I remember that barn.  But I don't remember the horse and the buggy.  I do remember the cars that we had.  We had a Packard, which was a super car.  I guess it was the Mercedes of that day.  And we had a Hupmobile, which was a two-seater car, which in the back was like a convertible, you know, the back seat was, you could open, and you'd sit in the back seat in the air and all.  So I remember that about him.  I remember he used to carry me at times to East Durham to visit his patients, and he had some friends down there who we'd go to see.  The man who married him, I remember him as Reverend Sowell and his wife.  They had a store in East Durham.  I can remember very well the, going down there in these cars and all.  And at that time, there were not paved roads.  They had dirt roads, and all, and I remember, you know, sometimes it was muddy and all.  But he would take me with him and all.  And this is about all I can remember about my father.  I remember it was very devastating to my mother and to my brother [William Wormley Strudwick], you know, when my father died.  But being eight years old, it just did not translate to me very well, until I started not being able--my mother would tell me that we can't afford this and we can't afford that.  That's when it started to hit me.  But from that point on, from eight, through nine to ten and all that, took it, but anyway, there were some things that I wanted.  So I started working at ten years of age.  I started finding little jobs to make money.

Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about your ancestry.  How far back can you trace your ancestry?  Do you know if your family were free people, if they were slaves?  How far back can you trace?
Speaker 2: Okay, as far as I know I, father's [William Canady Strudwick], as I told you, my father's mother [Irana Strudwick] and father [Henry Strudwick] were slaves.  I can go back to that.  But they were freed.  They were, you know, in 1865 when the Civil War ended, they were freed.  And I think they were relatively young at the time.  And so I think their children and all grew up, you know, free kids, and all, I suppose.  And that's, as I said about my father, and he apparently went to school in Durham.  And as I told you, he went to elementary school, high school, I guess, whatever they had in those days.  And he went to college at Shaw University in Raleigh, North Carolina.  He--I don't know at what stage, whether it was two years at Shaw when he went into medical school, which was Leonard Medical School.  And so he graduated from Leonard Medical School and practiced in Durham.  Now, so far as my mother's [Mabel Christina Wormley] parents were concerned, I remember Anna Wormley, what they had told me about her, that she was born and raised in Virginia.  You know, we looked at that picture, in Fredericksburg, Virginia, apparently.  And my grandfather on that side, he was born, they say in Madagascar.  Now, how he got from Madagascar to Washington, D.C., I do not know.  But he was a prominent--they say, blacksmith, a very good blacksmith and all.  So he and my grandmother, they apparently, in that time, must have been making pretty good money and all.  They had a house on Westminster Street in Washington, D.C., which was a line of, a whole lots of blacks were on that street and all.  I don't think it was any whites at all, but around there were whites.  And so she was a housewife, and he was a blacksmith.  They had, again, exact numbers, but I think about ten children.  They had four girls, one girl died with tuberculosis, and my mother was the second youngest, I think--no, she was about the third youngest.  My Aunt Fannie was my, the youngest, and Uncle Jim was the next, and then my mother was next.  And so those three were very close.  And I had older aunts and uncles which I did not know as well as I knew them, you know.  So, so, of course, that, about my grandmother and grandfather, grandparents were concerned, that was it.
Speaker 1: Were there any stories that were passed down through your family about the grandparents and about--any stories they shared with you all about slavery, that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: No, the only thing that I knew, as I told you, I think that my grandfather on my father's side was an overseer.  They called him Opie, Opie-seer.  And I think that he did receive some property at the time that they, you know, what is it?  Forty acres and a mule.  I think that whoever owned him at that time gave him some land in Durham, down by the swamp where mosquitoes were and everything.  But anyway, he tilled that land and all.  And my--he and she, as I said, they had about ten children also.  They had mainly boys.  I don't know of any girls that they mentioned.  But anyway, the only one I knew is my father and my uncle, Uncle Liam (ph.).  I knew him.  But the rest of the men, I did not know.  The only people I know by the name of Strudwick were in East--West Durham, North Carolina, and I used to see them occasionally.  They were cousins.  That's the only Strudwicks that I knew.  What happened to my uncles, I do not know.  Again, that is history I need to try to research.  But it's--in my wife's [Bette Catoe] family--or they may have died of the flu.  I have no idea what happened to them.  That's about it.
Story_ID: 13697
Speaker 1: What's your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: The real earliest memory of growing up, I guess was sitting in a high chair and eating breakfast, oatmeal, and my mother [Mabel Christina Wormley] teaching me my ABC's.  My mother was a teacher, and teaching me my ABC's and challenging me because there was a friend of mine--she said that Arthur can do this.  Why can't you?  And I can remember that.  And it was a challenge, and I met the challenge (laughter).
Speaker 1: And tell us a little bit about what daily life was like in your house as a boy?
Speaker 2: Okay, my early daily life, as I said, I don't remember.  I remember it was very good.  I remember we had a house in which we had all of the amenities of what we would call a house, a living room, dining room, parlor and kitchen.  We had things that were considered modern in those days.  Actually, we had heat, you know.  We had a furnace and radiators and all, steam heat, in that particular house.  Now, that was up until I was eight years old.  At eight years old, seemed like everything started being different and all.  In fact, we--the furnace did not work right and all.  We had to start using the fireplace and all.  In that time, in the winter and all, we would even--in the cold weather and all, we would, my mother would even cook in the fireplace and all.  I remember that.  And I had a brother [William Wormley Strudwick].  My brother was eight years older than I, and so he was living a little different life it seemed.  He was very smart, and he finished high school at fourteen years of age.  And he went on to college--he finished college at eighteen years of age.  But anyway, up until that time, he--just thinking about myself and my brother and all, he, you know, had learned how to drive a car and things like that, and he was well ahead of his age, I think in both academics and in living, some of the things I think that he did (laughter), told me that.  I remember those things.  Now, so far as I was concerned, I remember going to elementary school and really enjoyed school.  One part of my education in the first grade was a little, as in any other family, there was a little disruption as I remember in the family.  And my mother brought me up to Washington, D.C., up here.  And part of the first grade, I spent in Washington, D.C.  Then I went back and finished the first grade in Durham, and in fact, finished elementary school in Durham and all of my other education, just about, early education in Durham, North Carolina.  But those early things, what can I say?  Durham was a city that was progressive, I think.  I remember being able to go to the movie in the black community.  We had two black movies in the black community really.  I just remember the days that you paid five cents and had a card, and you'd go see a western movie.  And you'd do that on Saturday, and during the week, you know, you went to school like anywhere else.  And we had all our games that we played at that time, you know, you shoot marbles in the dirt and all.  And we called them dabs.  And you played marbles, you played hop scotch, and you played hide-and-go-seek.  You did a lot of things that, outdoors, you know.  And houses weren't, you know, you didn't worry about stealing and all that ole stuff cause everybody was confined to the community and nobody had any transportation that they could do something and get away fast.  And everybody knew everybody in the community, whatever status in life you were.
Speaker 1: Could you tell--?
Speaker 2: And you knew all your teachers.  You knew where they lived.  You knew all your ministers, you knew your doctors, you knew the people who worked in the factories.  And, in fact, one thing that I do know too about my early life is Durham, North Carolina smelled like tobacco, the whole city, you could smell it.  It was tobacco land.  You had the Liggett & Meyers tobacco factory at which the majority of the blacks worked, you know.  And that was, you know, early in my life.  The other thing that we knew in the black community is that the aim of everybody was to get a good education.  They pushed you to get education.  Even though many parents, I mean, had no education at all, they were pushing their kids to get an education.  So this was the kind of life in early--in my life too, we even had those amenities that many of the whites had, like I had told you about the swimming pools and things like that, that whites had, we did not have.  And early in my life, they built a swimming pool for blacks, a recreation center for blacks, they built a swimming pool.  And fortunately for us, we had a teacher that taught at North Carolina College.  And at that time it was called North Carolina College for Negroes.  He came to Durham, North Carolina, and he, for some of the young kids and all, we had an opportunity to be taught by him to do gymnastics, and since we got the swimming pool, to learn how to swim.  And early in my life, I became a junior lifeguard, and following that, as I went on up, I went--as I got older, I got to be a senior lifeguard.  And when I went to college, I became an instructor in swimming.  So that type of thing, I was very fortunate to be at that point in life, that these things did happen to me.
Story_ID: 13698
Speaker 1: Can you tell us what sights and sounds remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sights and sounds?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: The sights that I, things that I saw early in my life were things that you see in the South.  You saw nature, as such.  You saw the birds, the bees, the hummingbirds, the robins, the--you just saw nature, the buzzards.  You saw, you had animals around, dogs--the lady down the street from me had a cow.  I saw her milking her cow.  I saw things like, you know, that's early in my life.  And there were people who, just down the street raised chickens, you know.  You had chickens, and I would see the biddies, we called them biddies, you know, the young chicks, you know, see 'em running around and all.  And so, and gardens, people, you know, you had, planted cabbage, potatoes and stuff like that.  It was a typical Southern town.  It was a town, but rural, and you saw all of these things.
Speaker 1: And what sounds?
Speaker 2: The sounds, okay.  Okay, one of the sounds that you used to hear was the trains, okay.  There was a train track that ran between the black section and white section where I lived, and you'd hear these trains.  And people used to tell time by the train.  That's the 6:00 o'clock train, (making train sound).  You know, you'd hear that sound.  That's the 6:00 o'clock train, it's the 12:00 o'clock train.  And also the factory, to tell the people what time, you'd hear factory whistles.  They'd go weeeeh, the factory whistles and know--and the church bells, the church bells.  I mean on a Sunday, you heard church bells.  You heard the bells for Sunday school.  You heard the bells for church.  For Sunday school, they rang at 9:00 o'clock.  For church, 11:00 o'clock.  And, but very few sounds as relates to cars and stuff like that.  Many people--not many, but some people had the horses and also you knew the horse sounds.  You knew the cow sounds.  You knew all those things so far as sounds were concerned.
Story_ID: 13699
Speaker 1: Can you tell us your brother's name and how many years older he was?
Speaker 2: He was eight years older than I.  And his name was William Wormley Strudwick.  And as I told you, he was quite smart, and he finished high school early, at fourteen years of age, and he was very interested in foreign language, and he learned French.  And he taught French at eighteen years of age in our high school.  He was that well trained in the French language.
Speaker 1: So was your brother a teacher?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 13700
Speaker 1: What elementary school did you attend, Dr. Strudwick, and who--do you remember some of your teachers there, and did they influence you?
Speaker 2: Well, education was a thing that we always--that they always emphasized in my city.  As I said, and my elementary school was W. G. Pearson Elementary School.
Speaker 1: Could you spell that, please?
Speaker 2: W. that's, initial W, G, and I think his name was William, G. Pearson.  Okay, he was, I guess one of the most educated blacks in the city at the time, I suppose because the school was named after him.  But he was the principal of the high school, Hillside High School, where I went to high school.  I went to elementary school at W. G. Pearson up until the sixth grade.  I went to Whitted School in the seventh grade, and from the eighth through the eleventh grade, I went to Hillside High School.  We did not go to the twelfth grade to graduate from high school.  We graduated from the eleventh grade.
Speaker 1: What was the junior high school again?
Speaker 2: Oh, no junior high school.
Speaker 1: Oh, well, seventh grade, what?
Speaker 2: Just high school.
Speaker 1: What school did you go to in seventh grade?
Speaker 2: I was in high school--Hillside High School went from the seventh grade to the eleventh grade.
Speaker 1: But you mentioned another school.
Speaker 2: I went to the seventh grade at Whitted School, which was a new school that they built that year.  It was brand new.  I went there.  And I left Pearson School at the sixth grade, and instead of going to Hillside for the seventh grade, I went to Whitted School for the seventh grade.
Speaker 1: Okay, tell--.
Speaker 2: But they still had seventh grade at Hillside, but I went to the seventh grade at Whitted.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Do you remember some of your teachers in elementary school?
Speaker 2: Sure, sure.
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about them.
Speaker 2: Okay, Ora Sneed was the first grade teacher.  Ora Sneed taught everybody in my section of town, I mean and anybody that wasn't taught by Ora Sneed wasn't taught by anybody.  But anyway, she was my first grade teacher.  Let's see, Mrs. Smith was my fourth grade teacher.  She was one that did not take any mess off anybody, and everybody knew that.  And Miss Malloy was my, she was my fifth grade teacher, and she was the teacher who taught music.  And it was always a good thing to be on her choir, you know, in school.  And I was on that from the fourth, fifth and sixth grade.  Sixth grade was Mr. Smith, and he taught me in the sixth grade, and they had me, I guess, to go on to the, Whitted.  Fourth grade, I was taught by Lucille Johnson.  And the reason I remember her is Albert Johnson was my classmate, and that was her brother.  And she taught us math.  We started rotating through school in the fourth grade, and she taught math.  Third grade, Ms. Smith--no, it wasn't Smith.  I was trying to think of the second and third grade--I know them, I can see them, but I can't remember their names right, just right off the bat.  It'll come to me.  But anyway--.
Speaker 1: What kind of student were you in elementary school?
Speaker 2: I assume I was smart.  I just--I (chuckle), I, one thing that I did always, when I left school, the first thing I did when I went home was to get my homework.  After I finished my homework, I went out to play.  My neighborhood people took care of me.  My mother [Mabel Christina Wormley] taught school, but she taught school in the county.  Like I told you, my daddy [William Canady Strudwick] died when I was eight [1932].  She would go to the county early in the morning, and go out to the county to teach and all, and I was left to my own ways of going to school and getting out and going to school and all.  And in the evening when I came home, she would be getting home late, about four or 5:00 o'clock.  And so I got my homework, and I was through with that, and I went out and played.  And it was just--and I guess inducted into me to really get my homework and all.  And it came, it was interesting and pretty easy to me, as I recall.  So I didn't have much of a problem.
Story_ID: 13701
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about what you were like as a young boy. What kinds of things did you like to do? And were you a well-mannered child? Obedient child? Shy? How would you describe yourself?
Speaker 2: No, I was an outgoing child. I wasn't--I was well-mannered. I mean, most kids in that day were well-mannered. Yes sir, yes ma'am. And you respected your elders and all, at least that's the way I was brought up to do it. I told you, I was not a saint, I did anything that anybody else has done. I tried anything that anyone else has tried. And I've always felt very fortunate that some of the things that kids are exposed to today, that I was not exposed to, 'cause I might have tried it. I can't say that I wouldn't. It was just that way in the town and all.  The biggest thing, as I said, you know, you, you--what was I like?  I tried to do everything.  I tried to, you know, do sports and all.  But I was too little.  I was a late grower.  And I could not--I played baseball, I played football, but that was sandlot football, basketball.  I did everything else everybody did, including boxing.  But I was just too small for my age and all.  And plus, I was a year ahead of myself in school also, just like my brother [William Wormley Strudwick].  He was ahead of his self, I was ahead of myself.  And most kids that I were in--I was in class with were larger than I.  Just like my sons [William J. Strudwick and Warren J. Strudwick Jr.].  My sons were the same way.  They, you know, used to regret the fact, why can't I be big like those boys that I go to school with.  But I was not.  So, early in high school, I got attached to sports, but I was the manager of the water boys for the football team, basketball team and all.  So that's how I was in sports.  And so far as the other things we were in, we were in the safety patrol.  And at that time, the safety patrol was well organized, and you had to wear a uniform, and you had your belt on.  You had to be--and the lady who was head of it, her name was Rachel Brock Pratt.  And she demanded perfection.  And she was one of those teachers, and as I said--I hadn't said it before, but I would say that I was very fortunate, is that the teachers that taught me in high school would have been professors in college in other, you know, if they were in the other gener--ethnic groups and all.  And these were very smart people.  And I was very fortunate to be taught by them, and--.
Speaker 1: During the elementary school years, did you have dreams and aspirations at this time?  What were you thinking you wanted to do or be when you grew up?
Speaker 2: An engineer.  When I was young, I, I marveled at the man who--and I, I do remember that, the man who fixed the electricity.  I marveled at the electric light bulbs, the radios, and that's what was big.  In those days, radio, they didn't have any TV and all that ole stuff.  But the radios and things that ran by electricity.  I, I--it just fascinated me.  And so I wanted to be that.  And for whatever reason, it was a challenge to me cause everybody said, oh, you're so smart and all, you're gonna be like your daddy [William Canady Strudwick].  You're gonna be a doctor.  And my--well, I can't say it, but anyway, I said, "The heck I am," I mean, you know, I'm gonna be me.  I'm gonna be what I want to do.  And so I guess I was that way, you know.  It wasn't until later on that I came to my senses (laughter).
Story_ID: 13702
Speaker 1: Earlier you talked a little bit about church.  What were some experiences like for you there at church?  What were the experiences like?
Speaker 2: Well, church was a very good experience for me.  And it was a meeting place in which all the kids went to church--at least the kids that I knew went to church and all.  So it was a meeting place where you met your friends, and they all went to church.  And we went to, just two, I guess, churches that we went to, Baptist and Methodist.  There were very few people in my time--in the black community as I, far as I knew, who were Catholics or Episcopalians and all.  There was an Episcopal church down in the, what they called the better part of town, if you want to call it that.  There was an Episcopal church.  But most of the people went to two churches in my neighborhood.  Now, in other neighborhoods, there were other churches, but they were mostly Baptist.  And, but I was Methodist.  I was brought up as Methodist.  And I enjoyed church.  Church was the thing that you, you went to, to Christian endeavor on Sunday night.  You went to Sunday school and met your friends, and your friends went with you.  And so it was a, it was a good experience.  And I think that if we had a little bit more of that today, our kids would be good.  But church was a center of, you know, activities, picnics and things of that nature.  And, you know, in the summer, they had, had the programs in the summer, you know, at the churches and all.
Story_ID: 13703
Speaker 1: I know that you didn't attend junior high school, but during that time frame in your life, so sixth, seventh and eighth grade, the early teenage years, who were some of the people who were influencing you, and who were some of your friends?
Speaker 2: Okay, during that period of time, I'd say some of the people who influenced me were my friends who--as I said, this coach, Coach McClendon, was a big influence in that particular period of time, and that is the period of time that they built the recreation center.  I told you that we had no recreation center for blacks.  They had it for whites.  The only thing we had to swim in, for blacks was wading pools.  They had pool--wading pools in black communities.  But they built a swimming pool in Durham, and they had an area in which you could play baseball and softball and basketball.  And they had a--I can't remember the thing, but anyway, it was a place where they had a piccolo, and a piccolo was like a nickelodeon, you know.  You put your money in, and--the dance area in which you could go and dance and swim.  It was right next to the swimming pool.  And you'd hear that music, and you'd swim and all like that.  And it was a very interesting time, really, for me between those formative years.  And the person, as I said, the coach was one who influenced me, and teachers who pushed me.  I couldn't tell you exactly which one had the most influence.  We had a history teacher that would push me and tell me, well, Warren, you're very smart.  If you do this and you do that--but one of the most--Rachel Brock Pratt was one who really pushed me.  A lady in eighth grade was, name was Grace Lanier (ph.), she helped, at least--these people encouraged me.  And they would use me sometimes for their tests that they had to do for getting their masters or graduating, and I'd have to take these tests for them.  They would choose me to do it and all, for whatever reason.  And I guess they considered me as being a smart young man, maybe, I don't know.  And one other thing that I really liked, liked to do at that time was build model airplanes.  I used to build model airplanes.  I wanted to be pilot.  That's one of the other things I wanted to be.  So a guy by the name of E. D. Lloyd and myself, we built model airplanes, and we'd compare how we built them and see if they would fly and all.  And they had the little gasoline engines, and all, and I used to use those and all when we could get enough money to buy one.  And I don't think I ever made one really fly.  Every time they'd go up in the air, and they'd come back down and they'd crash.  And then it'd take me two more days to repair 'em and all (laughter).  But anyway, but anyway, that was one of the things--that was one of my real, real hobbies that I liked, to build model airplanes.

Speaker 1: What was high school like for you?
Speaker 2: High school like?
Speaker 1: What--?
Speaker 2: Very good.  Yeah, high school was good.  As I said, I was sort of like on the safety patrol, safety patrol.  And again, we were like a ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] really.  I think they had a lot, you know, the--like that, and some of the other schools and all.  I think in Washington [D.C.], it was a big thing, you know, the military thing and all.  But we had that at Hillside [High School], and every year we would come to Washington for the, the safety patrol parade.  And that was one thing that you aspired to.  They had high school dances, which I liked.  I'd go to the dances and, as I said, I was a little bitty thing, and all the older girls would like to teach me to dance.  And that, learned how to dance, boogie.  And (laughter), and so, let me see, and some of the other things in high school, I mean like--I was never a very good talker.  I did not like the debate team.  I didn't like the debating team and all, so I never got to be on the debating team.
Speaker 1: During high school, were you still thinking that you were going to be an engineer or a pilot?  Were you still thinking that during high school?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.  Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: And were you thinking about going to college?
Speaker 2: Yes, oh, well, I didn't have any doubts about going to college.  I mean, you know, my mother [Mabel Christina Wormley] and my father [William Canady Strudwick] had gone to college, and my brother [William Wormley Strudwick] had gone to college.  So it was this, that type of environment that I was brought up in.  And everybody around me, no matter what their financial situation was, concerned and all, that's what they wanted to do.  And that's wanted--what they wanted their children to do, no matter who they were in the, in my community.  Now, what happened in West Durham or North Durham or other places, I don't know.  But in my community, that was the prime objective, was going, finishing high school and going to college.
Speaker 1: Who were some of your teachers in high school?
Speaker 2: I told you that one very--that stood out more than others was Grace, Ms. [Rachel Brock] Pratt at--she was in the eleventh grade, and she was my eleventh grade homeroom teacher.  And she was one.  Then you had the coach who taught biology, Herman Riddick.  He was the football coach, and he was one of the influential people in which you watched and wanted to emulate.  You had my--I used to like my Latin teacher, and I liked Latin because it was a foreign language, and I was just trying to learn Latin.  I used to like that.  And, let's see, math was Grace Lanier, and it was another lady who taught math that--I can't remember her name.
Speaker 1: Um-hum, that's okay.
Speaker 2: If I saw the name, I'd remember it, you know.  When you read something, you remember it.
Speaker 1: Sure, right.
Speaker 2: But just remembering it offhand, I don't know.
Speaker 1: What year did you graduate from high school?
Speaker 2: 1940.
Story_ID: 13705
Speaker 1: After you graduated from high school, where were you thinking you were going to go college?
Speaker 2: I knew where I was going the first year.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: I was going to North Carolina College for Negroes.  That was right there in my hometown within walking distance.  In fact, it was a shorter distance than going to Whitted Elementary School.  I never did--I walked to every school I ever went to in life in Durham--(laughter).
Speaker 1: And--.
Speaker 2: --with no transportation like that.  I used to ride a bicycle going to high school.
Speaker 1: And so when you went to North Carolina College for Negroes, what was that experience like for you?
Speaker 2: It was wonderful.  I, I enjoyed it and all.  The only thing I didn't enjoy about it, it was in my hometown, and many of the guys that I knew were going away to college.  They were going to West Virginia State [University], Virginia State [University], Hampton [University], Howard [University], up here, and Howard.  They were going away everywhere, and I wanted to go away to school like them.  They'd come back and tell you about dormitory life and how, the fun they were having and all.  And so this is what I wanted to do.  So after my first year of college, a guy told me that, you know, we could go away and make some money up at Asbury Park, New Jersey as bus boys and waiters and all.  And that summer, I went away and made some money and applied to West Virginia State for a work scholarship.  And I got a work scholarship there waiting tables, you know, work scholarship, and, and made a little money.  I wasn't making much money, but anyway, it didn't cost that much.  It, it cost a lot, but in today's climate, it wouldn't be that much, but at that time, fifteen dollars was a whole quarter that you had to pay to go to North Carolina College, fifteen dollars per quarter.  But anyway, my second year of college I went to West Virginia State.
Speaker 1: And so that was in 1942?
Speaker 2: Forty one [1941].
Speaker 1: Forty one [1941]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in '42 [1942].  The next half year--okay, that, after I finished that first year, everybody, all my friends--not all of 'em, but many of my friends were being drafted.  That was during World War II.  They were being drafted and going into the service and all.  And so they had a program, civilian air training, and I got into civilian air training, and I learned to fly an airplane.  I soloed an airplane on the Kanawha River at West Virginia State College, fly up under bridges and all that ole stuff.  And that was a great experience for me.  And I thought I could get into the Air Force.  Some of the friends I knew got in the air force.  But again, I think it was because of my age, maybe, I don't know.  I know two older guys who got in.  They were a year older or a couple of years older than I.  But they swore that I couldn't see.  Well, I had never worn glasses in my life, but they swore I couldn't see.  So therefore, I couldn't get into the Air Force.  So I went back to school that half year, and--because all my friends looked like, were going into the service and all, I said, it won't be long before I'm drafted to go in, I quit school.  I quit school and went to Chapel Hill and started waiting tables and all that ole stuff, and doing that.  But true enough, I was drafted.  I mean I, I'd figured that out right.
Speaker 1: What year were you drafted?
Speaker 2: That was in 1942.  And really, '42 or, yeah.  And I had a choice, which the people didn't have before.  I had a choice to either go to the Army, the Navy, Coast Guard, Marine Corps.  I chose the Marine Corps.  So I was one of the first few blacks to get into the United States Marine Corps.
Speaker 1: What were your experiences like in the Marine--?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: What were your experiences like in the Marine Corps in the 1940s?
Speaker 2: Very good, very good.  And, so far as service was concerned, I was in one of the first, what we called combative units.  Instead of being in, you know, what they called depot units in which you were warehousemen, you know, just took care of stuff, like that.  But I was in the 51st defense battalion, they called it.  And with that, I went to training, and they were training you fast in those days.  And so the first six months was at, there, and we went from there to California.  We went to San Diego, California and from San Diego, California, I got on the ship and went to the South Pacific.  I went to a island called the Ellice Islands [now Tuvalu], and it was a little island called Funafuti.  So as a defense battalion, we were there.  And while we were there, we got a chance--we were transferred up to the [Republic of the] Marshall Islands.  And that's where they had, you know, they tested for the atomic bombs and all that ole stuff, not at that time.  But anyway, I went to the Marshall Islands, and I was in radar.  Radar was like, you know, TV that we have today.  And radar was, you detected airplanes or ships.  And I was in the ship radar.  And while I was there on this little island, they were, wanted some people to apply for officers in the Marine Corps.  At that time, there were no black officers in the Marine Corps.  So I applied, and I was elected or selected to go to school, finish my schooling and go to officer training school.  But you had to finish college first.  So I went to Purdue University.
Speaker 1: And this was in 1943?
Speaker 2: Forty three [1943], three or four [1944], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I was at Purdue University for about a year, and, a year and, nah, how long was I at Purdue?  About a year or less than a year or something.  But anyway, something adverse happened, which I cannot mention, but anyway, I had to leave Purdue.  And I left Purdue, and at that time, the war was kind of winding down a bit, but not completely.  So I knew some guys in the, in the administration, and so I just told them that, let me go up there to Richmond.  In Richmond, Virginia, (chuckle) they had some warehouses in Richmond in which Marines would go.  They didn't stay on the army base.  They stayed out in the city, and you went to work just like you go to work anywhere else.  And so I said, let me go up there, man and all, since the war is over, and I'm applying to get out of this thing.  So they said, okay.  So I went to Richmond, Virginia and stayed up there for about six months.  And then when I left there, I went back to camp and that's when I got discharged from the U. S. Marine Corps.  The war was over, or getting over, oh, it was over, really, and came out of there.  And I came to Washington [D.C.].  Now, I told you my mother [Mabel Christina Wormley] was raised in, in Washington, D.C.  So Washington was like a second home to me anyway, although at the time when I was a little boy, I hated it (laughter).  I hated Washington because I had to come up here and dress up and all that ole stuff.  And at home I didn't have to do that.  In the summer, you could go barefoot and have a good time and play outdoors and all.  Washington, you couldn't do that.  You had to go sit out front and all that ole stuff.  I didn't like that, but anyway that was (laughter) neither here nor there.  So I went to Purdue, and when I came to Washington, the Marine Corps found out.  And when I get out of here, I got to do something.  I got to do something for myself, you know.  I got to finish school and do something cause I hadn't finished college and all.  I had been a year at North Carolina.  I'd been a year and a half at West Virginia and then I'd gone to Purdue.  And I still hadn't finished college and all.  So I said, well, let me apply to Howard [University], which I did.  And I applied to Howard, got into Howard's undergrad school.  And I guess that's--and I graduated from Howard in nineteen hundred--undergrad school, 1948.  It took me eight years to finish undergrad school.
Speaker 1: At Howard?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I graduated from Howard.
Speaker 1: Right, but you were working, what took you so long to finish?  Were you working, taking classes part time?
Speaker 2: Oh, at that time, oh, yes I worked, I always worked all my life.  I was working in a clothing store.  I worked at Union Station loading box cars.  I worked at, waiting tables down at, at one time, you know, downtown, what was that place in (unclear)--anyway, it was well-known restaurant that I worked at as a waiter and all.  And I did a little bit of everything during my life.
Speaker 1: What year did you enter Howard?  What year was that?
Speaker 2: Medical school or Howard University?
Speaker 1: No, Howard University undergrad.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) '46 [1946].
Speaker 1: Nineteen forty six [1946], and you graduated in 1948.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And when you went to Howard, were you still thinking you were gonna study engineering?
Speaker 2: I had an idea when I first went, but then--okay, the reason I went to Howard because as I said, I had friends here.  And all of them were in either medical school or pre-med.  These were guys I had gone to school with in Durham.  It was Johnny Gilchrist, David Weaver, all of these guys were here.  David was in pre-med.  Johnny was in medical school, Tom Bass was in dental school and all.  And I knew these guys.  I said, well, you know, in order to go to engineering school--Howard didn't have a good engineering--they had an engineering, but not good.  It would be in Chicago.  But as I said, I thought about it, I said, you know, I got all these courses, and I got just about all pre-med courses.  And my daddy [William Canady Strudwick] was a doctor.  He did pretty good.  I said, I came my senses, I said, well, you know, being a physician is not so bad.  And if I got into medicine, I would want to be something with my hands, be a surgeon.  And that's what I got to be.  But anyway, that was my thinking at that time.  And so I applied to medical school and one thing that helped me was meeting my wife [Bette Catoe], cause she, at the time she was in medical school, she kind of, you know, pushed me, and she helped me make out the applications and all that stuff, you know.  So I was thinking about going, whatever, elsewhere, you know.  But anyway, to make a long story short, I was accepted to medical school.  And so I went to medical school.
Story_ID: 13706
Speaker 1: What were our experiences like in medical school, like were there any classes that you really enjoyed taking in medical school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess, you know, to me all of 'em were enjoyable if it were not for who--sometimes who was teaching and all, but the subject itself, I mean, was quite interesting, you know.  You were learning all the time.  You learned about bacteria, you learned about the germs, and you learned--they called it bacteriology.  You learned about anatomy, you learned the anatomy of the body.  You learned what is biochemistry, you know, the chemical elements of the body.  You--it was just a very interesting experience for me anyway.  And you did not--what you were trying to do is get the basics before you went to clinical medicine, and everybody strived to get to clinical medicine when you start treating, taking care of patients.  But anyway, and early, I, I enjoyed it.
Speaker 1: So while you were in medical school, did you know that you wanted to be a surgeon or were you still trying to determine what type of medicine you would go into?
Speaker 2: No, I wanted to be a surgeon, yeah.  I wanted to do something with my hands.  I always wanted to do something--that's why I said I wanted to be an engineer and all.  I wanted to be something, you know.  So surgery was the thing that I would be doing with my hands and all.  And it was fascinating to me.  Surgery was fascinating, and I wanted to be able to do something to a person that would make them better.  And most things in surgery, you were operating to make a person better.  In medicine, there were some things that--and most things with surgery, you could cure, if you're gonna operate on 'em.  But in medicine, you weren't--you could treat them, but you knew they were gonna die no matter what you did (chuckle).  So surgery was my choice as far as that was concerned.
Speaker 1: And while you were in medical school, you--as you mentioned, while you were at Howard [University] you met your wife [Bette Catoe].  And you all married in medical school.  What was that like, being married while going to medical school?
Speaker 2: It was okay.  And the reason it was okay, and I think that one of the best things that happened to me was maybe going into the service.  I grew up in the service.  It made me know that I, when I got out, I had to do something, and it gave me the GI Bill of Rights, and I don't think, if I had not had the GI Bill of Rights, I would have been able to afford to go to medical school or to finish college.  I don't know, I have no idea, but I do know the GI Bill of Rights took me all the way through except for my last year of medical school in which I got a scholarship for that.  But up until that point, you know, the GI took care of us.  I worked part time.  I worked--part of the time, I worked at the post office, you know, just about the whole time I was in medical school really.  And you can't work now.  They do not allow you to work.  It's too much to learn.  They don't allow you to work now.  If you're gonna work, you can work at something related to medicine.  So it's a little different in this day.  I know some of my classmates worked full time, you know, doing something, during medical school days.
Story_ID: 13707
Speaker 1: What was your mother's reaction once you had made this decision that you were going to pursue a career in medicine?
Speaker 2: She [Mabel Christina Wormley] was very happy about it really.  She had nothing against it whatsoever.  I had told you now, my dad [William Canady Strudwick], Dad died very young.  I mean, you know, he was forty-some years old when he died, and I was eight years old.  And so--and my brother [William Wormley Strudwick] was older.  And he, after finished college, had started teaching and all, and so he went his way really in a way.  And so it was just my mom and I.  Really, I was like a only son at that particular time, and all, and he died very young.  And he died in automobile accident when, my first year of medical school, April the first, 1948.  He--no, 1949--I started in '48 [1948], and April the first, he died.  The guy who called me and told me, you know, that he had been an accident and, you know, he was dead, I said, well, that's a hell of a April fool joke to be playing on somebody.  But anyway, so after then, you know--and before then, you know, we did not live the life, and my mother and he did not live the life they had lived when my father was living.  You know, he--and at that time, you know, you couldn't get good insurances and stuff like that--black people couldn't and all.  And so she had to start working, as I said.  And she worked up until, a long time before she retired.  And she retired because she had not, I don't think, finished all of her courses and all.  And I guess she was, not up to it or something.  I don't know.  But anyway, no, she, she was for it, no problems.
Story_ID: 13708
Speaker 1: While you were at Howard [University], we talked a little bit about you met your wife [Bette Catoe] there.  You all were married, and once you received your medical degree, tell us a little bit about your residencies and what they were like?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I mean I'm sorry, prior to--what were your residencies like?
Speaker 2: The residency, okay.  Well, as, you know, you had to finish your internship, a general, what we called a general internship.  When you finished medical school in those days, you--and it's like general medicine.  You rotated through all of the services that they had at that particular time, at any school, which we did.  And that was very, very interested--interesting, and at the time, you know, I had made up my mind that I wanted to go into surgery.  Some of the teachers who taught me were, I thought, Dr. [Burke] Syphax and Dr. [Frank] Jones, Dr.--the guys in surgery, [Mitchell W.] Spellman and a few other guys who, you know, I thought were good teachers and all.  And they would talk about the surgery and all.  I was very interested in it and all.  So that first year afterwards and during my internship, that's what I wanted to be.  I applied for surgery.  Now, I first applied for urology, which is the study of the, you know, the kidneys and the bladder and the uro-genital tract because I thought at first that maybe I'd stay here.  But then I thought about, you know, if I'm gonna go home--cause that was the first thing I thought about is when I finish medical school, I was going back to Durham and practice.  But then we thought about having a family, and our children would have to go back to a segregated school system and all.  And so I decided no, that's not what I wanted to do.  So I thought I'd better go into general surgery--oh, I mean before I thought I should go into, to urology if I were going to, to--well, how should I put it?  You know, let me--should I tell you exactly the way I thought about it.  I liked urology and all, but if I were going home, I needed general surgery, not urology.  I'm not going to Durham and be a specialist.  I needed to be a generalist in going to Durham.  And so I transferred from urology into general surgery that first year in residency.  And I enjoyed it and all.  During the, my residency, I--we had children, as I said, and that was a big influence on whether I was going back to Durham or not, as I told you.  And, what else happened during residency?
Speaker 1: Well,--.
Speaker 2: Very fortunate in some ways in residency, I don't know.  I went to, my third year I went out to Norfolk, Virginia, and it was called Norfolk Community Hospital.  And I had--I was in my third year, and I had just free reign to do what I wanted to do.  And for a person who's learning, that's all they wanted to do.  And malpractice and stuff wasn't all out at that time, and you, as a trainee, could do just about anything.  And I had good doctors from the Norfolk General Hospital and all, and they would come over and supervise me and everything.  And I had a good time.  I had to stay there a year, which I didn't like.  But I did stay there a year.  And then I came back here in my chief residency year and my, what we call a year of, another year of training I did with Dr. Jack White--for two years really in a cancer fellowship, which I enjoyed and all.  So I enjoyed my training.
Story_ID: 13709
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about what it was like practicing medicine in, in the '50s [1950s], what was that like?
Speaker 2: It was good.  It was--.
Speaker 1: For an African American doctor?
Speaker 2: --at that, at that, that particular time, you could practice medicine with the idea that you were, you were helping people and your patients--you know, you and your patients got together in such a way, and if you were that type of individual, you know.  I'm a people man and a patients' man.  And so I, I enjoyed my practice and all.  You did not have the restraints or the thing looking over you as you do in the field today.  It was an enjoyable time in relationship to practicing medicine with people, and patients respected you and you respected the patients.  But in today's climate, it's a little bit different.  If you want to make a comparison, in today's climate, toward the end of my term that I was practicing solo by myself and all, I felt like every patient who came to the office, no matter who they were, they had a lawyer with them.  There were two people coming in there to see me, the patient and a lawyer.  And they wanted perfection, and you cannot make a ten out of a five.  If a patient comes to you sick, they are sick, and I can't put them back together and make them like they were when they were twenty years old and all.  And people thought that, you know, think, now, today, that you can't make a mistake.  And it's not a matter of making a mistake all the time.  It's a matter of what you're dealing with, who you're dealing with.  If a person is sick, they're sick.  And you try to help them, and you got to have two things going for you.  You got to have body immunity.  You got to get--your body has to help you and whatever treatment you give is an aid, not making you perfect.  It will not do it.  And in today's climate, they cost you.  They want you to have malpractice insurance and all those things and, or in many instances in some fields, I mean it just costs too much.  You're working not for yourself.  You're working for the insurance company, and you're working for your staff.  And sometime it's hard to make the two come together (laughter), you know.  You have to work too hard, number one, and you, it just does--it's not good in today's climate.
Speaker 1: Dr. Strudwick, also in the late '50s, you and your wife [Bette Catoe], and I presume some other doctors were, helped to integrate the hospitals in Washington, D.C.  Tell me a little bit about what that experience was like.  Was it experience--was it an opportunity that you, you really wanted to do or were you somewhat hesitant about it?
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't hesitant at all.  It's something we wanted to do.  We wanted to integrate, and, which we did.  And we knew--I knew.  During my internship, I interned at D.C. General Hospital, and in interning at that time, it was Gallagher Hospital.  And at--that was the name of it.  Again, I was in a place where the next year, it became D.C. General Hospital.  But at Gallagher Hospital, I learned, I worked with people from Georgetown [University] and George Washington [University], graduates from there.  And there I learned that, you know, my education was far, I felt, superior to their education.  We were asked questions about diseases that they had never heard of (chuckle) and all.  And all they were asked about was what was common, things that we would see every day.  And you knew about it and all.  But our professors were always pushing us a little bit more to learn a little bit more about everything, really.  And also I learned then that, you know, that was no problem at all.  It was just like earlier in my life, I had gone to Purdue University.  When I went to Purdue University, I thought I was going to, you know, these upscale colleges and all, that the other people went to and all, that they were harder and all like that.  And I found out this was the easiest thing in the world because they told you exactly what they were gonna ask you on the examination.  And they--this you got to learn, that's what I'm gonna ask you.  That was easy.  I mean, you know, we, when we went to school, we were never taught that way.  You were taught, you'd better learn everything and you didn't have any clue as to what they were gonna ask you (chuckle).  But anyway, in these situations, they did.  So, and this I found out.  So that was no problem.  It was no problem that I felt as if I was inadequate or anything like that; going to these hospitals, I knew I was just as good or maybe superior to these guys that I was going practicing with.  I mean I'm not the smartest man in the world.  I'm sure that they had good people too, but, you know, I knew that I could do it.  It was no question about that.
Speaker 1: Did you meet some resistance though?
Speaker 2: After you got in, no, there was not resistance as such, but there were things that, you know, you were, you didn't get a chance to do, like election to, to different staff positions and stuff like that.  There were guys that you knew that you were, not better than, but you knew that you could do just as well as them and maybe even superior in some ways and all.  But you could not do that.  They did not let you do that.  It's not until now that these things have changed altogether, but at the time when I went in and all, you just could not do that and all.  However, I tried to go to every hospital in the city.  I got, (chuckle), I was--any time that you could go--well, at the time, you applied to, you did not have to pay.  Now, you have to pay staff dues and all that ole stuff at all the hospitals and all, but you could be on the staff without all of that.  So I applied to Children's Hospital [Children's National Medical Center], to Sibley Hospital, to Washington Hospital Center, the Greater Southeast Hospital, to--what's that hospital's name out there?  What's the man's name, it's a man's hospital.  I can't remember.  Anyway, but all of these hospitals I applied to.  And I had privileges everywhere, all over the city (laughter).  And I enjoyed it and all.  It made you meet a lot of people in different aspects of life.  And so it was, it was fine.

Speaker 1: And in 1961, you began teaching at Howard University.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I--you start teaching when you're, as a resident.  You start teaching people who are below you and all, from that point on, yeah.
Speaker 1: What--.
Speaker 2: But, yeah--.
Speaker 1: What did you like about teaching?
Speaker 2: Well, it kept you on your toes and all.  You had to be, try to be ahead of everybody, to read what you could and go through the different courses and stuff like that to be ahead of everybody.  And it kept you abreast of things.  Teaching always keeps you abreast because you can always think that there will be students who, you know, will challenge you.  They will know just as much as you, and maybe even more.  And they teach you also.  As I said, it keeps you on your toes, yes, I, I liked to teach, yes.
Speaker 1: And what are some of the changes that you've seen in medical students over the years, like over the last thirty years?  What are some of the changes that you've seen?
Speaker 2: Well, the last years, the, the medical students really are about the same except for the fact that now most of 'em come in, you know--it's not unusual for them to be married and have families and all as opposed to years ago, most of the students were not married and all.  Most of the residents were married and all.  But now people want to live their life and go to school also, which they do, especially, you know, after you get to graduate school and all.  And the students, a student is about the same.  You got good students, medium students, you got students who are not good.  That's all.  And, no, I don't think it's any changes as such, so far as students and their attitudes are concerned.  They have more modern things.  You've got people who, you know, this is a electronic age.  You know, you got, things are being taught by way of the computer, by way of TV and things of that nature which we did not have.  Most of the stuff was oral or by textbooks and all.  But now, you could find an answer to anything, you know, in a few minutes, you know, by way of--in fact, the students that come into--I know Howard University now in the first year, you got to have a laptop computer.  They furnish them, but you got to have a laptop, and with that, you got to know how to use it (laughter), you know.  So that's a little different than the way we were taught, really.  You--they had mannequins now, which are different than having to really have a live cadaver.  You know, you could use--they've got mannequins, which they are now making, which is like a live person--well, not really.  But anyway, it's a little different in your training.  So maybe they're a little ahead of us in that aspect than what we were like.
Speaker 1: And, and I'm sure another change too is more women.
Speaker 2: Well, so far as--who?  In medical school, that is very true.  Women make up fifty percent.  I went to a conference the other day, and it was residents' day, residents' graduation day.  The senior residents were graduating as of the end of this month.  And there were four them, two women, two men.  And years ago, you know, just to have a woman, I mean, was a, you know, a new thing and all.  And, coming up next year, they had the junior residents who are coming up next year, five women and one man.  And so it's just, that's different, at least at Howard for right now.  So--.
Speaker 1: How do you think your teaching style has changed over the years?
Speaker 2: Yeah, as I said, the teaching style has changed because we have different means of teaching, like--in many of the things that you used to use, you had to do the drawings and all that ole stuff, you know, on a blackboard or, and things of that nature, you do by way of, of technicalities, you know.  You have your computers, as I said, and you got the computer language up there and all.  Like I go to conferences now, and it was a time you had to get like, this photographer here, you had, you have the thirty-five millimeter pictures and all, and stack 'em up and all and use those particular things to show the things.  But now, all you have to do use a digitalized camera, and I can take your picture, and in a minute I got it back, up there on a bulletin board.  It didn't take but a few seconds to do, you know, which is altogether different now.  And you see live things that you couldn't see before, like you can see operative procedures and all that are just there in a picture.  You can see the surgeons do it and all, as opposed to before, you know, that you'd have to have somebody to take the picture.  And you'd have a stack of pictures.  And then you see all the aspects  as the way it goes.  The--one thing though that they, I think is a negative is you do not have that patient-doctor relationship.  You do not have that one-on-one relationship.  I see you, and I got to examine you.  I don't, you know, today's climate, you know, as I said, you got to have the--I don't know.  It's, it's just, it's just different.  And you don't have--you don't have that.  You don't have the patient-doctor relationship.  Let's put it to you that's way--that--.
Speaker 1: Do you think that--you don't--is it?  We don't have it because it's not being taught in medical school like it used to be or why do you think we don't have it now?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  It's not a--you don't know your patients.  You don't know, in fact, you see a patient--some of the doctors now see a patient as a disease and not as a person.  You come in to see me, you're Mary Jane, and Mary Jane, you're married.  You've got a husband, you've got children and (unclear) and all.  But now, I see you, you've got a tumor on your breast.  I examine you, you've got a tumor on your breast, and I'm gonna tell you what you need to have done.  And boom, next patient.  I don't know what affect it might have on you, your family or, you know, the, the psychological aspects come into play.  They are not into play as they are today.

Speaker 1: How much do you think managed care and the way that our healthcare system has changed is attributable to that lack of rapport between physician and patient?
Speaker 2: Well, it has a lot to do with it.  There's no question about that and all.  Number one, managed care has made it so that you can't--I really don't think that you get out of it--well, it has a lot to do with financing too.  And you don't get what you deserve as far as I'm concerned and all.  You go to school to get trained, and it takes many years to get trained.  You don't start out making any kind of monies until you finish school.  And then half the time now, when they finish school, they owe more than they--you know, they owe quite a bit that they got to pay back.  And managed care is not helping.  Managed care is demanding that they pay a certain amount of money, you know, to you for doing a certain thing.  Plus, they think that everybody is the same.  You are doing a procedure.  I think that you should stay in the hospital over night.  Managed care said, no way.  Your particular disease that you have right now only demands that you can treat 'em, and they go home.  You do not know where they're going home to or what they're going home to, whether when they go home somebody can care for them, to feed them, to clothe them or whatever it may be.  But managed care said, they--all they look at is the disease, the name of the disease and, and boom, boom, one, two, three, four, five.  And this is not right, period.  Now, maybe a patient that I'll see today, that you can go home.  The next patient I see, this is homeless individual that when I say discharge, you going back out in the street.  And also managed care does not give you the medicine sometimes that you need.  And they don't get the medicines that they need, and people are gonna die and people are dying because they are not getting the care that they should get.  And they're demanding--and many of the hospitals don't want to treat you because they are not being paid for it.  They tell the hospitals that they got to let this person go or that person go and all.  It, it is not good for medicine.
Speaker 1: And do--.
Speaker 2: Medicine is an individual thing, no matter what anybody says.  It's not an industry.  It's not a factory, like, you know, you got ten people who got breast cancer and this, they're treated, one, two, three, four, five.  That is not the way medicine is or should be treated, but that's the way it's being treated now.
Speaker 1: And do you think that it impacts African Americans very differently than it impacts whites and other minorities?
Speaker 2: Yes, according to who you are, yes.  But if most of the--many, not most, but many blacks, you know, don't have the financial security that many whites have and all, yes.  It, that's the primary effect and all.  And the other effect is that they should be telling you and teaching you these things.  And they don't do that, so far as education or health is concerned.  I see more people, just like in most cities or in this city, health and education are not the number one priority.  Health and education should be the--if you don't have an education, you don't know that you should be healthy.  If you don't have your health, you can't get a good education, period.  And so the two go hand-in-hand, both ways.  And it's not that way today.  All they are looking at, just like in our city today, they're talking about, you know, they want to tax all the industries so they can build a baseball park, a baseball park.  See, what I'm saying, anything--but let's tax all the industries so that we can give everybody in the city of Washington good health and good education.  Let's, let's upgrade the schools, let's upgrade our health education system, and all.  No, they're talking about baseball or football or track or something, which I have nothing against, but I don't think it should be a priority.  That's, that's what I'm saying.  It should be down the line.
Story_ID: 13712
Speaker 1: And what impact do you think violence has had on medicine over the last, you know, forty years or so?
Speaker 2: Violence?
Speaker 1: Yes, you know, just the level of violence and increase in violent crimes, and, you know, people being treated for violent--.
Speaker 2: Well, we'll better able, if you can get the person to the hospital to be treated for violence today; we do have a lot of violence--I don't think we're having any more than we had before except for the fact that I think it's advertised more, I mean it's being told.  I think the same has been happening for years.  It's just that we were not told about it.
Speaker 1: So--.
Speaker 2: It costs money to treat people, and violent crimes cost a lot more than other types of injuries.
Speaker 1: But you're seeing the same types of people coming in, with the same types of--what are some of the differences?
Speaker 2: You don't have any different type.  You got gunshot wounds now, and you've got people who destroy people.  They have bad accidents in automobiles and things of this nature.  Years ago it was not that many guns around, I don't think.  In fact, we didn't have that many gunshot wounds.  We didn't have it.  We had knife wounds.  We had somebody boxing, beating you up or something like that.  But in today's climate, it's not that way.  I mean they shoot you; they kill you, they run into with a car.  I mean there are too many ways in which you can really harm a person.  And the more harm a person have, the harder it is to treat 'em.  You got to treat 'em, and then you stay up, you know, twenty-four hours, and in the next hour they're dead.  And you've spent all of that time trying to do it.  So, yes, there is a difference--I guess there--if you were gonna ask me, point blank, yeah, violence is more and violence costs more.
Speaker 1: And does it get easier to deal with the, the death in losing a patient over the years, as you've, you know, practiced medicine longer and longer?
Speaker 2: It's according to who you are, I mean as you deal with death and all.  I, you know, it's--if it's inevitable, you have to deal with it.  If it's not inevitable, you always think and what is it I could done to save this life?  And so it all depends upon the individual, how it affects you, one way or another.  If you're in a situation in which, I think my son is in and in emergency rooms and in traumatic areas and all, they deal with it every day.  And it, maybe it doesn't affect them as much as it would the people that, you know, are being harmed.  But it's not that they don't have feelings.  They--it's just like anything else.  You see so much of it.
Story_ID: 13713
Speaker 1: You have two sons [Warren James Strudwick Jr. and William Jeffrey Strudwick] who are also in medicine.  So tell me a little bit about your, your thoughts or your reaction when they decided to follow in their father's footsteps and their grandfather's [William Canady Strudwick] footsteps?
Speaker 2: Well, I was very happy that they decided to do that.  But I asked them did they really want to do that, that medicine is a little different than it used to be, and did they really want to do that?  And really, I got no answer except for the fact that they applied and went on into medicine (laughter), yeah--.
Speaker 1: And when we talked a little--.
Speaker 2: --which was fine.
Speaker 1: When we talked a little bit about some of the changes in medicine with the malpractice and, you know, and every--and like you say, you feel like sometimes two people are walking in the door at the same time, a patient and an attorney.  Does that concern you for your sons?
Speaker 2: Yes, it does, whether they realize it or not.  But they are coming up in a different society, and it's common to them.  They--it's a difference, different world today to them.  Now, it's according to what they're in.  Now, my oldest son is in a situation in which the legal aspects are high, very high.  And I think he has to pay quite a bit for malpractice.  However, my son is in a hospital environment and I think that's part of their contract.  I think the hospital pays for his malpractice.
Speaker 1: And let's talk a little bit about your oldest son.  Can you start by telling us his name and type of medicine he practices and where and what he does?
Speaker 2: Okay, his name is Warren James Strudwick, Jr. and he practices orthopedics.  And he specializes in what we call sports medicine.  I think he has really narrowed it down to certain areas of the body that he treat and all.  I think he does a lot of shoulder and knee surgery, a lot of tendon surgery and ligament surgery as opposed to what one called general orthopedics.  You know, in general orthopedics, you treat, you know, fractures and muscle injuries of that nature.  But being in the sports industry or sports medicine, really, he treats more injuries like that than some of the other injuries that are seen every day.  I don't think at this moment he's taking house calls or taking what--not house calls, but hospital calls.  So he's not running into the traumatic situation like automobile accidents and things of this nature.  So--.
Speaker 1: And he's a physician for the Oakland Raiders.
Speaker 2: For the Oakland Raiders, yeah, for the football team, yes.  So he does examinations for them to see if a person is fit, number one, to play.  And then when they get transfers or get, you know, a patient coming in from somewhere else, to make absolutely sure that he is okay, when coming from this other team, that he doesn't have some hidden injury or something like that, that they're not telling you.
Speaker 1: And when you look at that, do you think opportunities like that were available when, you know, you were first starting out in your career for African American physicians?
Speaker 2: Well, it's not as, as available as--even now, than it was then really.  I know, I think it's about two or three doctors that have been in that particular situation, and I think now--I'm not sure, I don't think it's with only about two.  I think he did tell me there was another doctor that's--for one other team, I think it's only about two of them.  It's not common, you know.  So the opportunities may be there, but I, I don't--I really, I can't, I can't truly answer that.
Speaker 1: And tell us about your other son?
Speaker 2: Okay, he's a very--.
Speaker 1: Starting with his name, sorry.
Speaker 2: It's William Jeffrey Strudwicks--Strudwick.  And he is very, he--once he starts on a job, he is gonna stick with it, no matter what it may be, he's gonna work very hard to succeed.  And he's gonna try to do everything that he's supposed to do, and right now, he's in charge of the emergency room, but he wants to do the administrative part, as well as doing the other medical part.  It's a stress situation, and the other thing is that he is a wonderful family man.  He has four children, and he tries to take care of all of them and, with the aid of his wife, he wants to take of his wife.  He wants to do all of these things.  Plus, he likes sports and all too.  He is, takes--he's on the boxing commission also.  He goes to most of the major fights in the city.  And he's the physician at these major fights, boxing matches, you know.  So, and he's also on the, I think a city commission, city trauma commission, I, I--I'm, I'm not sure about which one.  I know he is.
Speaker 1: And you signed both of their medical licenses when they graduated from medical school, correct?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: Their--.
Speaker 2: The license to practice medicine.
Speaker 1: To practice medicine.
Speaker 2: A degree in medicine doesn't give you the right to practice medicine.  You still have to have some qualifications.  You got to pass licensure boards.  There are general licensure boards and then there are specialty licensure boards.  And so you have to pass these, and then you get the permit.  Even with those, you got to get permit--get the permission to practice medicine in different jurisdictions.
Speaker 1: What--?
Speaker 2: In different states or, and city, you got to get--in some places you got to have a state license, you got to have a city license.  So all of these things come into play.
Speaker 1: Were those very proud moments for you?
Speaker 2: Very proud, yes, yes, very much so.
Speaker 1: Can you describe them for us?
Speaker 2: What, the emotion?  Well, I always tell them that they are doing very well as third-generation physicians.  And my daddy was a physician.  Their mother [Bette Catoe] and father are physicians, and they, they are third generation.  So, yeah, I'm very proud of them.
Story_ID: 13714
Speaker 1: What advice to you have for a person who is interested in pursing a career in medicine?
Speaker 2: To be realistic about it, know a little bit more about what you're getting into.  If you really want to take care of people and practice medicine, fine.  If you're going into the medicine for other reasons, it's not a good profession to go into.  If you're thinking about medicine, I'm going in there to make money or something of that nature, no.  It is not a good profession.  You got to want to practice medicine in today's climate, I think, and all, and want to take care of people, yes.
Story_ID: 13715
Speaker 1: When you look back at your life in the, as a whole, what really stands out the most or is there something that kind of stands out the most to you?
Speaker 2: Okay, one of the things that stands out to me is that when I finished medical school, the first thing I wanted to do was to make absolutely sure that I got a license to practice medicine.  You know, as I said, you finish medical school, but then you got to take examinations to get a license.  Okay, well the first thing I wanted to do was to make sure I got a license.  So--and I thought I was gonna practice in North Carolina.  And at that time, you could get a state license, and you could get reciprocity just about any other place in the country, that you wanted to practice.  So I went to North Carolina with some friends, including--and my wife [Bette Catoe].  We went down to North Carolina to take the board and to get our license, which we did.  And we waited very patiently--you know, you take the test one month, and then about two months later, you find out whether you did pass or not.  And all that time period, you know, you're anxious and all like that.  And I can remember that the 'Durham Morning Herald' was downtown.  It was a place downtown, I think it was on the E Street, E, Pennsylvania Avenue and E or something like that.  But anyway, I could find a city paper.  And I remember, you know, when that date came up, going downtown to get that paper to see, you know, if I had passed the examination and found that we all did, had passed the exam, maybe except, maybe one or two.  But anyway, in addition to that, they said the highest marks were made by three people, and I was named as one of them.  I was so happy to find that out.  And I was thinking about that so far as thinking about then, you know, you had to have reciprocity, pass the board, never did I ever dream that one day that I would be on the board of medicine, nor the, you know, the chairman of the board of medicine of, you know, this board in which, at that particular time, I was so uptight and all about, and during my lifetime, that had come about.  And never during my lifetime did I think that some of the things that are happening now, like some of my comrades, you know, colleagues' children, would be head, like we got a, my son's classmate is head of the traumatic unit over at John Hopkins University.  He's head of that, and he's internationally known for that as well as my son.  And you find these kids, and these are things that I'm so happy about and all that it's happening today, in today's climate.  And I hope that for whatever reason, that we can get more people to kind of encourage blacks or our group to do more.  We, we've lost that some kind of way, and we wanted the right to have--or wanted access to everything in this country, which we didn't have before.  And sometimes integration, in and of itself, did not do what we want it really to do because it did take away--those people who were good, it took away from our schools and things--those teachers that I told you about and all.  I got a wonderful education in, everywhere I went.  I got a--and Purdue [University] wasn't the place that I got all that.  As I said, I found out that I was well ahead of these kids, you know, and when they gonna tell me what I'm gonna do, all I got to do is remember, you know, that this, I can't--don't have to figure out something like that.  So I don't know.  I don't know how we can get back to it.  I don't know if we, as such, like myself, my wife and some of the others haven't gone back to these schools and see if we can encourage the kids, to be mentors to the kids in these predominantly black schools or predominantly, you know, schools--I don't, I don't know how we can do it really because I don't think that the general public is helping us do this.  I don't know.  And it's been generations since it happened, so therefore, it's--you got to go way back into generations to get it done or to rectify what happening today.  I don't know.
Story_ID: 13716
Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?  What would you like for people to say about you?
Speaker 2: I was a good daddy (laughter).  No, my, my remembrance is, say I was a good family man, I, you know, we--I took care of my family and that my children are okay and remember that; that I was a husband, tried to be a good husband.  That's about it really, I was a good doctor, you know, and tried to take care of people.
Story_ID: 13717
Speaker 1: And why do you think history is important and more particularly, why do you think it's important to preserve history, especially African American history?
Speaker 2: Well, it's no question about it if it's preserved in the right way.  And it is imparted to the kids.  The kids got to know it.  I mean you can preserve history on tape and pictures and stuff like that.  If anybody doesn't see it and know it, it does not make any difference.  So history has to be taught so that people learn from it.  You got to learn from history and keep in context those things that are good and eliminate the bad in history.  So this is what, to me, history is all about or should be all about anyway.  That's about it really.  As I said, my thing in, as a young child, as I told you, as a young child, I could see that--and I used to think about that.  I'd say my daddy [William Canady Strudwick] went to school, my mama [Mabel Christina Wormley] went to school and my brother [William Wormley Strudwick] went to school.  It was historical, then I got to do it.  It was just as simple as that so far as the history of my family was concerned.
Story_ID: 13718
Speaker 1: We even talked a little bit about your father [William Canady Strudwick], and you talked about how here's your father, the son of slaves who went on to medical school.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Share some of your thoughts with me that we had talked about before, about that?
Speaker 2: About that?  Well, I just wanted to find out, how did he do it?  How was it done?  I mean did his parents [Henry and Irana Strudwick] push him to do it or did he, himself, looked around and say, I can do it.  Or someone in his life, other than his parents say, Bill, you can do this.  Now, his--the first grade teacher that I told you, I'm not sure whether she did not have some influence or taught him, cause she taught everybody in Durham, I think (laughter).  Her name was Ora Sneed, and she was the one that taught me about my grandfather, that his name was Obie.  She knew him, for some reason.  And she took that picture, you know I had a picture of my grandfather.  She took that picture.  Now, what kind of camera she had to take it, I don't know.
Story_ID: 13719
Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be, Dr. Strudwick?
Speaker 2: My legacy?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: My legacy is my children, just, period.  I don't, you know, I just, for them, just like I think I'm the legacy of my parents [Mabel Christina Wormley and William Canady Strudwick], and my children is my legacy.
Story_ID: 13720
Speaker 1: I think that--yeah, there, there are some things that need to be said.  I think it has a lot to do with our country and our city.  I think that we--I don't know.  We need to think about the world in general and think about helping people in general.  That's all over the world.  I don't think that we are doing that, as such.  Many of the times we think that what we do--and what I'm saying as we do, I think in our country, we got people who think that they know it all.  And they think that their form of government, our form of government, democracy, is the best form of government.  I'm not sure that it is.  I'm not positive that it is.  There can be governments, and there can be people who can take care of hoards and hoards of people under a, not dictatorship or under a--what would I say?  I don't know, mentorship or mentoring or whatever it is, and all, that are good.  A good king or dictator is just as good as a good democracy, I think.
Speaker 2: Great.
Speaker 1: I mean, I, I may be wrong, (laughter), you know, but I really think so, that--and a person who is honest, you know.  I don't think that always we, our punishment is always correct.  And I think that there are people or judges, whatever and whoever they may be, there are good judges and bad judges.  There are good things in democracy, but I think there are bad things in democracy.  So I don't know (chuckle).
