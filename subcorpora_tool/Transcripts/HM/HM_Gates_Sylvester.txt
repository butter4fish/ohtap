Speaker 2: Certainly. My name is Sylvester James Gates, Jr., that's S-Y-L-V-E-S-T-E-R James, J-A-M-E-S, Gates, G-A-T-E-S, and we spell it with a comma before the J-R.
Speaker 1: A comma, okay, alright. And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I was born on December the 15th in 1950 in the little town of Tampa, Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay. And sir, what is your title and occupation?
Speaker 2: My title is sort of long. I am the John S. Toll Professor of Physics and the Director for the Center for String and Particle Theory here at the University of Maryland. My profession is professor of physics.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright. And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: The 20--the, I'm sorry, what is today's date guys? I'm sorry. Oh thank you. Today is 30th of August, 2012.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: Currently we're located in the physics department at the University of Maryland in College Park, Maryland.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 22191
Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth, there are five lightweight "People Magazine-ish" type questions--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --that we ask as a warm up and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do. It's ham.
Speaker 1: Alright. Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do. It's winter.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Green is my favorite color.
Speaker 1: Alright. A favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I have no favorite vacation destination.
Speaker 1: Alright. And the last one is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I don't actually have a favorite phrase or saying.
Story_ID: 22192
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes. My mother's name was Charlie Anglin Gates. That's C-H-A-R-L-I-E Anglin, A-N-G-L-I-N Gates, G-A-T-E-S.
Speaker 1: Alright. And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I can look that up. I don't have it memorized.
Speaker 1: Okay. Do you have a rough idea of--so you were born in 1950?
Speaker 2: Yes, mother--just a moment. As I said I'd have to look that up. I've got it actually on my computer but if you--and if you want to record it, I can--that's why I brought my computer. That's your call.
Speaker 1: Well just a rough--1920s?
Speaker 2: Around about 1920 or so.
Speaker 1: Around 1920?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, circa 1920 and--okay. And where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Texas, near to Houston.
Speaker 1: Now is this rural Texas outside of Houston?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now back in those days Houston itself was not that big so it was probably--
Speaker 2: It was not.
Speaker 1: --a rural setting you think of farms?
Speaker 2: As far as I know. As I said these are approximate answers. I can, like I said I can give you her exact date because I have it on my computer but I don't know very much about my mother, the circumstances of my mother's life. My mother was an orphan so she lost both her father and her mother at a very young age. She was raised by an aunt who lived in San Antonio, Texas and her aunt's name was Ann. And my aunt Annie, as we used to call her, had two daughters and so my mother came to sort of be the third daughter in the family.
Speaker 1: Raised in San Antonio. And your mother passed when you were--?
Speaker 2: My mother, my biological mother died when I was eleven.
Speaker 1: Okay. So do you know anything about the ancestors on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: Not really. We know that there was some French blood in the family. She had a brother who became orphaned with her. However, her brother was sent to live with other relatives so they didn't actually grow up as siblings.
Story_ID: 22193
Speaker 1: Now there's a--do you know what the story is behind her [his mother, Charlie Anglin Gates] name?
Speaker 2: No, I don't. I truly do not know the story behind my mother's maiden name.
Speaker 1: Okay. Charlie, there are other women named Charlie, but you know there usually is a story as to why.
Speaker 2: Well I'm sorry, for that part I can. My mother's father was expecting a son.
Speaker 1: Okay. So they gave it, just gave it the spelling of the I-E spelling which is normally used to designate female Charlies, but not always.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah. So, and Anglin now that's the French--
Speaker 2: I believe so.
Speaker 1: --portion of the name. Okay, of course Houston's down near the gulf and where New Orleans--
Speaker 2: Not that far from Louisiana.
Speaker 1: --yeah Louisiana. That whole area is kind of--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --has a French kind of flavor to it. So any, so did you ever meet your uncle, your mother's brother?
Speaker 2: No, we never did. We only heard stories about him.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now--so did your mother ever talk to you about growing up and what happened when she was coming up in San Antonio?
Speaker 2: Not to my recollection. As I said she--my mother contracted cancer when I was eight years old so you know I was relatively young. And before that you know we just didn't have the occasion to talk a lot about family history. We grew up on army bases we were always separated from family. You know for us, family was the nuclear family, my father, my mother and my three siblings. That was the notion of family so it was extremely rare to--we knew you know that they had these relatives out there somewhere but they were not part of our lives in any meaningful way.
Speaker 1: Okay. Did your father or your Aunt Annie talk about your mother's personality and her character--?
Speaker 2: Yes. Actually yes, because in fact during the last year of my biological mother's life she was receiving treatment for cancer at the hospital at Fort Sam Houston, which is actually in San Antonio. So my siblings and my father lived in my Aunt Annie's house the same woman who had raised my mother, for the last year of my mother's life. And so we heard some stories about my mother from her. My mother was an artistic person and she--and I--this is something I know from personal experience. I have recollections of her firing clay, of her doing macrame embroidery, so she was very much into artistic endeavors. She had an eye for color and somewhat of a flair for appearance. As I said, I'll show you a picture of her and you'll see some of that in the picture. I also know she loved to dance.
Speaker 1: Okay. I'm thinking here. Now did your mother have a chance to go to college?
Speaker 2: No, neither my father nor my mother completed college. In fact, I am the first person in my family to go to college.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, so did your mother complete high school?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did complete high school.
Speaker 1: In Houston or--?
Speaker 2: San Antonio because that's--
Speaker 1: San Antonio.
Speaker 2: --when she was being raised by my aunt.
Speaker 1: Now what's the--
Speaker 2: Her aunt.
Speaker 1: Do you know the school in San Antonio?
Speaker 2: No, I don't. I don't.
Speaker 1: I know there's a black high school, I think it's another Booker T. Washington I think or--
Speaker 2: It could well be. I don't know.
Speaker 1: --or Carver, or George Washington Carver, something like that.
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: But it's--there is a handful of black people in San Antonio and that's what--
Speaker 2: I'm sure during that milieu.
Speaker 1: Yeah. So any rate, do you know if your mother you know was fulfilling her life's ambition or she had a, you know some people grow up with a plan to b ea nurse or a teacher or a dancer or whatever--?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Well my--well remember, this is the 1950s and so for a lot of women, their career was housewife. My mother was a classical 1950s housewife. My father went to work in the morning and she was in charge of the house. She--that was part of the time when I have recollection of her sort of exercising her interest in art. So I remember watching her carve and glaze and taking classes to do that sort of thing. I--it was my impression from my memories that my mother's children were the center of her life.
Speaker 1: She often involved the children in craft activities?
Speaker 2: When I say children, I mean her children and she was involved with us in those sorts of things.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what I meant.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so alright.
Speaker 2: I have recollections of being on the, probably around five, six or seven years old and having my mother bathe us separately, coming into the bathroom and she would be standing and kneeling by the tub and put each one of us in and washing us and having us come out and having one of these big, fluffy tile--towels wrapped around your body. Talk about mother's love.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was something.
Speaker 1: Very attentive mother.
Speaker 2: Very much. That's why I said her children seemed to be the center of her life.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 22194
Speaker 1: Can you give us your--well your father's name is just as yours except he's Senior, right?
Speaker 2: He's with the S-R back there, that's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay. And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Again, I'd have to look it up. I do have it. If you want it at the end of the interview we can get both of those pieces of information.
Speaker 1: Okay, but just for the sake now was he much--?
Speaker 2: About 1926. He's act-- he was actually younger than my mother [Charlie Anglin Gates].
Speaker 1: Okay, 1926, okay.
Speaker 2: My mother was a cougar before people knew what it meant.
Speaker 1: Okay, so six years difference that is a--
Speaker 2: It's pretty considerable.
Speaker 1: Yeah, interesting. You often see the opposite, six years.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah. Well the opposite is the norm.
Speaker 1: Yeah. And where was your father born?
Speaker 2: My father was born in Linden, Alabama which is not too very--well actually not in Linden but close to Linden which is then by turns close to Mobile. My father's grandfather was a sugar cane farmer and actually owned acreage so they weren't actually sharecroppers but as is typical of people in that time and place they were you know poor farming people. My grandfather and his wife separated when my father was about twelve. She chose to live in the city and my grandfather continued to live on the farm. For a while my father lived with his mother but ultimately decided, I'm not quite sure what the dynamic was but it was decided that he would live with his father on the farm.
Speaker 1: Now what was his grand--his father's name?
Speaker 2: Joseph.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's--
Speaker 2: And Joseph, in our stories, we have some stories about my grandfather. Joseph could neither read nor write but he could do arithmetic which meant that he was a very valuable person in the African American community because he's the person who could make sure that they didn't get cheated when they went to the stores and looking at the accounts.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright now that is important.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So now what was your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: I don't recall. Again, I can look it up cause I do have, I have my--I asked my father to actually write a short biography of his life so I would be able to tell his grandchildren when they ask me these questions. I do have it in my home.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright. Did you know your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Never met. Grandmother was dead by the time that we made our first visit to my grandfather's farm. We made several visits when I was a child so I actually got a chance to meet my grandfather Joseph but I did not ever have the opportunity to meet my grandmother on that side of the family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There was one uncle who was actually older than my father, Claude was his name as I recall. But Uncle Claude in fact had been killed well before I was born in a gambling match. So all we ever, so we never--we only heard stories about my uncle but we never had a chance to meet him. There are stories about a great, great grandfather who was a Native American of the Cree nation and who--there were stories about him that we heard as children.
Speaker 1: Is there a name that survives?
Speaker 2: We do not have a name for hm.
Speaker 1: Okay. So he was a Cree Indian.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: Or Cree or Creek, I'm not sure which way it's pronounced.
Speaker 1: I know there's a group of Creeks. I think there are Crees too but I know there are Creeks--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --who are you know mostly around Florida. They were the--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --Creeks and the Seminoles provided a big opposition to Andrew Jackson.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And there are lots of black Creeks and black Seminoles.
Speaker 2: Oh yes. Oh yes and so we do have Native American bloodline in our family. I like to tell people yeah, we really are Americans.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well lots of the Creeks and Seminoles have African blood in their veins too.
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.
Speaker 1: To the point that Jackson you know--
Speaker 2: Yes, I, I'm--
Speaker 1: You know about a quote from Jackson about the war?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He said this is not an Indian war, this is a Negro war, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, at any rate okay, now are there any other stories about your family back in the days of slavery or reconstruction or--?
Speaker 2: No, the only--the stories only go back as far as my great, great Native American grandfather. Those are all the stories that we have that--
Speaker 1: That would, that actually put him in Florida which is interesting cause you grew up in Florida. But--
Speaker 2: Well this is Alabama. Or, I guess you could be right. I'm not sure about the location, that's not something I can know with any certainty.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So it could well be that he was living in Florida at the time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Creeks were you know in having that lower part of Georgia, Florida area.
Speaker 2: Yes, of course. Yeah.
Story_ID: 22195
Speaker 1: But, okay so no other stories about that period of time?
Speaker 2: Not then. There are stories about my father [Sylvester James Gates, Sr.] I've--that are, to me very fascinating and I'd like to recite.
Speaker 1: Oh sure, that--okay.
Speaker 2: So, my father at around age twelve one day while he and his father were in the field, dad turned to his father and said I'm not going to be a farmer which was a little bit shocking for his father to hear. And I for the life of me have no idea how a twelve year old decides that they're not going to follow in the foot paths of their father. But my father made that decision and that he would make his life in the world that was away from the farm, in the bigger world. He joined the U.S. Army at age seventeen, around 1942 and he weighed all of 128 pounds on the day that he joined. And that number is significant because if he had been three pounds less he would have been rejected for being underweight. He went actually to be trained. Part of his training took place right here at Fort Belvoir in this area which I only learned decades later dad went off to the Second World War. He served as a member of the Red Ball Express spending 13 months in the European Theater of operations supplying Patton's [George Smith Patton, Jr., U.S. Army General during World War II] army as it rolled across Western Europe. He drove a Truck No. 13 that nobody else would drive because of the belief that 13 was an unlucky number and his response was hell, I'll drive it and he did so for thirteen months never got a scratch.
Speaker 1: So he drove Truck No. 13 for thirteen months?
Speaker 2: That's right. So at some point while he was a young soldier he had met an older African American soldier who had been in the Buffalo Soldiers and the older guy told him that one of the ways that he could make his way in the army was to learn about the rules and the code of behavior, learn them well and they will both protect you and help you. And that is advice that my dad took to heart. He served in the U.S. Army for 28 years so--and he enjoyed being a soldier enormously.
Speaker 1: Okay. I assume he reached the terminal rank you know for an enlisted man?
Speaker 2: My dad was--my father was one of the first 100 African Americans to be promoted to the rank of sergeant major which is the highest enlisted rank that you can be as an enlisted person in the U.S. Army. In fact there is a quote from the Fort Bliss Times because we were living in Fort Bliss, Texas when he received that promotion and there's a quote from him about the honor that it was to receive this recognition from the nation where someone could go from the bottom to the top and that it was his wish to continue to strive to return that honor by giving service to the country. And I, as I said I do have that exact quote someplace. It's one of the things that my father I remembered--my father was in fact an extremely unusual man. I only realized this in my forties, however.
Story_ID: 22196
Speaker 1: Now did your father finish high school before he joined the army?
Speaker 2: He did not. My father joined the U.S. Army during the Second World War and lied about his age to get in and went off to serve the country, found a path by which he could build his life. He always had an enormous desire for education, however. When I was a child I remember actually watching him study trigonometry and I think some calculus. The reason why trigonometry was important was because dad served part of his time in the U.S. Army in the artillery corps and it turns out that firing shells and how far they go and what have you, is determined by the laws of trigonometry. And so dad became fascinated with trigonometry and there's something in our family, an affinity for mathematics. I told you about my grandfather and I'm not telling you stories about my father and mathematics. I make my living doing mathematics and I have a daughter who is a double major in math and physics so we like mathematics in my family as odd as that may seem. But dad, although he didn't finish high school, had a great desire for all of his children to have that opportunity and so when I was six, seven and eight, the question wasn't whether you would go to college around the kitchen table, the question was what college were you going to?
Story_ID: 22197
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: Oh yes there is and I happen to know that story. So in 1943 or so, the young soldier, Sylvester James Gates, Sr. was preparing to go to Europe and he was in San Antonio, Texas near--probably at Fort Sam Houston. And there was a bar near to the post called Tuckers. And one weekend while he had a pass, he and some friends were there drinking at the bar and generally behaving the way young men do. And in walked this beautiful, tall woman and she loved to dance and her name was Charlie Anglin, and that's how they met.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My father was not such a great dancer but he made the pretense to get to know her.
Speaker 1: Okay. So this is before he was shipped off.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So did they get married before he left or--?
Speaker 2: Yes, they did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And in fact the photograph that I will later transfer to your possession is the photograph that she gave to him before he went to war in 1943. In fact, I didn't know this photograph existed until about ten years ago. And one day I came across it and asked him what it was. And he said this was the first picture your mother had ever--his words were this is the first picture your mother had ever given me and it stayed in my breast pocket the entire time I was in World War II. So it's amazing this photograph survived at all.
Speaker 1: Um-hmm. So your father was able to get through the war without being wounded or--?
Speaker 2: Not a scratch.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And interestingly enough, my father and my father in law did the same thing during the Second World War, both served in the Red Ball Express. And in fact they apparently entered the continent at around the same time. So it's possible that my father in law and my father met in 1943 before there was a dream of either I nor my wife's existence.
Story_ID: 22198
Speaker 1: Now I know that there must be some stories from the Red Ball Express that your father [Sylvester James Gates, Sr.] told.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, of course. Well the story that I remember most clearly my father telling, a couple of stories. So one of the stories that my father was fond of telling was so one day they were driving and they had, mostly officers from who the, from whom the soldiers took their orders were white. So my father one day had one of these white officers in the truck with him and they were driving some place and at some point the, they were supposed to pass another convoy headed in the other direction. And so this officer was wondering when they would actually meet, so my dad did a quick mental calculation and said, we'll probably meet in around fourteen minutes from now. And right on the clock, fourteen minutes, the opposite convoy passed and the officer was just stunned that this African American could just calculate distances and times like that and come up with an answer you know like a computer before computers were ever invented. And so this officer actually kept an eye on my father after that so that's one of his favorite stories which I recall. He also told stories about being near I think Liege in Brussels on occasion when there was a supply dump where a Nazi bomb went off. And so he was not hurt but he was close enough so that he and some of his fellow soldiers in his unit had to go and clean up some of the result from that.
Speaker 1: So your father had experience of joining a totally segregated army.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And then serving throughout, through the change, the official change to integration--
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: --in 1940--
Speaker 2: Eight.
Speaker 1: Eight.
Speaker 2: It was when Truman [Harry S. Truman, 33rd President of the United States] issued the order.
Speaker 1: Right, through the pains of the actual integration of it--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --which took some few years later--
Speaker 2: Oh absolutely.
Speaker 1: --and is still probably going on to some extent. But--
Speaker 2: Yes. And, but one of the things about the U.S. Army which people many people don't realize is because the U.S. Army started the process of integration essentially long before the nation ever got there, it turns out that people like me and sometimes we're called army brats, that is the kids of U.S. soldiers grew up at a time while most Americans were still afflicted with the most odious realizations of racism. For people like us, we actually lived in these protected islands and it was quite remarkable and I know I've met other African Americans of my age who were in a similar position because being a young, black kid on a U.S. army base in the 50s [1950s] was one of the few places where you were protected from most of the odious things that racism in this country represented. So it was quite remarkable that my father found a way to protect his children by pursuing this career path.
Speaker 1: This is--you speak truth here and I've known people in the army and air force who grew up and there is a certain amount of protection that comes from--
Speaker 2: It was.
Speaker 1: --being in that situation.
Speaker 2: It certainly was in those days.
Speaker 1: You're not completely away from racism but you, but certainly being in the army in Mississippi is different from being in town or South Carolina or Fort Jackson--
Speaker 2: Yes. Well, sure.
Speaker 1: --or whatever you know it's a lot different from being in the town.
Speaker 2: It is. So let me tell you a story that comes from my childhood. So around 1955 or so, we were living on an army base in St. Johns Newfoundland up in the maritime east, off the eastern shore of Continental Canada. The U.S. Army had bases and the Air Force had bases there as a result of Lend Lease Program. So dad was actually stationed on one of those bases. And one day a young, Caucasian American child called me a Nigger. Now this was the first time I had ever heard the word and I had no idea what it meant. So I came home that evening or when dad came home that evening I asked him, what did it mean and were we? And so my father apparently answered my question in some way. I don't have a recollection. But he made sure to go to speak to the father of this other child, making known that there would be consequences if this was ever repeated again. And so I didn't hear the word again until I was twelve years old from other African Americans.
Speaker 1: Okay. So how old were you when this happened?
Speaker 2: I was about four and a half or five.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And in fact, I have no recollection of this directly. This is a story that my father told me some years ago. I mean some years afterwards.
Story_ID: 22199
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay we--this story came up during the break we're going on with.
Speaker 2: Sure. So you know earlier I talked about the fact that part of my ethnic heritage is Native American. I'm aware that from our family oral histories that we have French blood in our blood line and probably some Scotch. So you know as an African American I'm very much aware that I connected to lots of blood lines, but when I was a child and living on army posts, most of the African Americans, in fact I have no recollection of an exception to this, most of the African Americans were about my color. And so it wasn't until after my mother died and we then moved to live with my stepmother that was the first time when I saw African Americans coming in different hues and range of skin tones. And so it was clear to me that African Americans have connections to all kinds of Americans in this country and you know I never thought about it as being either a plus or a minus, although it was also the first time when I became aware of what some people call colorism because as you know in the African American community there has been a traditional gradation and judgment of people's quality by the color of their skin tone. So I only learned about this when I was about twelve or fourteen years old.
Speaker 1: Okay. You didn't--no one in your family had that kind of a variation?
Speaker 2: No. We're about all the same color as I am. My father [Sylvester James Gates, Sr.] is a little bit darker and my mother [Charlie Anglin Gates] is a little bit lighter but that was about it.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 22200
Speaker 1: When you consider your parents' personalities, their dispositions, their looks, their habits, hobbies, attitudes, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Well I am my father's [Sylvester James Gates, Sr.] creation partly because my mother died so young. But when I, from what--when I look at the recollections I have of their personalities, predominantly what I know of my own personality reminds me of my father although there is one interesting and peculiar exception. I earlier talked about how my mother [Charlie Anglin Gates] was a very creative person along the lines of artistry and somehow it seems in me as though that streak for creativity motivated itself in my father's family's tradition of liking mathematics. So I make my living being a person who is creative at mathematics.
Story_ID: 22201
Speaker 1: I've often heard mathematicians say that, speak of elegant equations and--
Speaker 2: Oh yes, I do that quite often.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: There's a kind of beauty to mathematics that once you get to know it, mathematics--well the way, I have a story I tell people. I say imagine that you live on a planet with no sound, could music exist on that planet? Then I say well the answer is actually yes for a very peculiar reason because if the beings on that planet were maybe as smart as we are, maybe one of them would discover how to score music even though they couldn't hear music. And so you would have these people writing these very strange symbols on paper just like we actually score music here and some of these people would actually understand that these symbols are somehow connected to this something else, what we call music. And they might say well you know gee, that particular score is very elegant or beautiful or light and most of the people who don't know how to read the symbols would have no idea what they're talking about. That's how mathematics is on our planet.
Speaker 1: Okay, interesting explanation.
Story_ID: 22202
Speaker 1: So you have siblings, right? You have two siblings?
Speaker 2: I have two surviving siblings. There were three of us when we were children.
Speaker 1: Okay. Well can you just give everyone you know--
Speaker 2: Talk about each of my siblings?
Speaker 1: Yes. And place yourself in the birth order.
Speaker 2: Sure. So I'm the oldest of my, of the generation of my father's--mother--father's and mother's children. I have a brother a year younger than me approximately by the name or Ronald Joseph Gates who is currently surviving. And I have a sister two years younger than I am and her name is Sylvia Diane Gates formerly. She's a--DeBose is her married name. And both of my surviving siblings live in Orlando in the greater metropolitan Orlando, Florida area. My youngest sibling, William Bruce Gates died in 2005. So as children we were extremely close. In fact this is also something that's quite common among children who grow up with parents who were in the military as my father was. For such children the only constant in your life is your family because the father is often re-posted and so you're, you get used to the idea that every year or two you're going to move. And so the only constants are the people around you, your father, your mother and your siblings. And so you look to them for a sense of community. I've often observed that army brats, as we're called, or military brats, either loved or hated the experience that they had while they were children. And I, and it has almost invariably been the case that it has to do with what was going on with the family because if the family situation was one that, where there was security and love and the children knew that, then all of the rest of the changes didn't matter at all. But if that wasn't there in that nuclear family, there was nothing for a young child to hold onto and there's a sense of not belonging anywhere and I think that it's--you'll see this playing out in many brat's lives.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's serious.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That you belong nowhere.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's--okay. So now in your own case, how many places did you--can you kind of name the places in chronological order for us?
Speaker 2: Well, I was born in Tampa, Florida. The brother that is younger than me by a year was born in Orland--in Coco, Florida. My sister was born in San Antonio, Texas and my youngest brother was named--was born in St. Johns Newfoundland. So those are the places that I lived by the time I was five years old. At that point we moved to El Paso, Texas where my father was stationed at Fort Bliss. So I actually began school in 1957 at Huey Elementary School on the Fort Bliss Army Post. I went from there to Travis Elementary School and then from Travis I went to Fort Bliss Elementary School.
Speaker 1: Now that's all in El Paso?
Speaker 2: That's all on Fort Bliss.
Speaker 1: Okay, all on Fort--okay. So Travis Elementary School.
Speaker 2: Travis Elementary School then to Fort Bliss and then--
Speaker 1: Travis named for the Colonel Travis [Colonel William Bennett Travis, lieutenant colonel in the Texas Army] at the Alamo?
Speaker 2: I would suspect so cause this was Texas. Then from Fort Bliss I went to a school whose name I can never remember, but it was also on the army post. That was about the time that my mother [Charlie Anglin Gates] died.
Story_ID: 22203
Speaker 1: My mother [Charlie Anglin Gates] suffered from--well she was diagnosed with breast cancer when I was about eight years old and she was under treatment for that disease from the entire time that she was diagnosed from eight, my age eight until her death at eleven. She had a double mastectomy to try to save her life. By that time the disease had metastasized and in fact was in her lymph system and once cancer gets essentially to the human lymph system it's--there's nothing that can be done. She was still however, under medical treatment at Fort Sam Houston so that's why we moved back to San Antonio [Texas] where she had been raised because Fort Sam Houston has one of the best medical centers of the entire military system and so mother was being treated for cancer there while dad [Sylvester James Gates, Sr.] was re-posted to Fort Sam. My mother died at Fort Sam and dad was next re-posted--well about a year later he remarried but the final year of my mother's life I think was one of the most remarkable, was--showed me one of the most remarkable things I've ever seen. In the final year or two of my mother's life, my father had to raise four children effectively by himself and he was an active soldier in the U.S. Army. And yet there was not a single day that we went to school without having our shirts ironed. How an active duty soldier found the time and the means to organize his life and his children's life so that they never went to school with even wrinkled shirts, this to me amazes. I only thought about, realized all this much, much later in life but that's again a testament to who my father was as a man.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: At my mother's funeral the general of the Fort Bliss Army Post sent a color guard to mom's funeral in recognition of the kind of soldier my father was.
Story_ID: 22204
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sure. Let me start with my oldest memory. I was sixteen months old at the time I later found out. But the oldest memory I have as a conscious person is sitting in a chair and this thing which was black and belching smoke comes, passes by a window. For many years this memory puzzled me and when I was in my forties, one day I described this to my father and he was amazed. He said you were eighteen months old. That was the occasion of your first haircut. We were living in Orlando, Florida at the time. There was a barber shop where black people get their haircut and it had a set of railroad tracks not to very far out the front of it. And so this thing that I had remembered was a locomotive as it came passing by the barber shop. And my father went on to tell me that he knew that this was the memory because apparently I was so upset that I was inconsolable and just crying like mad, so much so that that evening when he got home from work, I was still crying and my poor mother was saying there's no way that she could stop me. And so we put the dots together and that's the oldest memory I have in life from eighteen months old. Other memories that stand out, I have one memory that is, I cannot describe in words but I know it's even older than 18 months. But other memories that I can describe for example are connected with St. Johns Newfoundland. For anyone who's ever been there and spent some time it's a very interesting landscape of rock and lichen and it's very distinctive. About ten years ago I was in a movie theater watching previews of coming attractions and I noticed in the background the landscape and I said, gee that's very strange because that landscape reminds me of St. Johns. It turns out the movie was The Shipping News. That movie was filmed in Newfoundland so there was something so distinctive about that landscape that it had imprinted itself in my, even my subconscious memory so that though I was only five the last time I saw that landscape in person, I could recognize it when I was in my 50s so I have that kind of memory. I have memories of Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas which is a desert climate. And in fact in some sense, I fell in love with the desert from that when I think about my childhood, that's the place I think of most is Fort Bliss. I remember the clear blue skies. I remember the snowfall typically coming in January and perhaps being around for no more than a week and then being gone so that by the first of January we could be in our shorts, short pants and short sleeve shirts outside playing touch football. I remember my first day of school running across a green field trying to escape from Huey Elementary trying to find my way back home because I didn't want to be separated from my mother and being chased down by one of the teachers and taken back to school. It's mostly for my visual memories and I actually have lots of them. When I was young my father said I actually have what's called a photographic memory so I can still see pictures from various points of my childhood really in fairly sharp relief even though I'm now approaching my sixty-second birthday.
Story_ID: 22205
Speaker 1: Now would you consider yourself to have a photographic memory or--?
Speaker 2: All I know is I have a memory that's peculiar, that I do know. I, one of my most important memory--well a couple of very important memories led to my becoming a scientist. So let me describe those. When I was four or five years old, my mother [Charlie Anglin Gates] bundled up her children to take them to a movie. And I remember standing in line and us huddling together and going into this darkened room and in fact this is the first time I believe I had ever been to a movie theater. And we entered the movie and sat down and we watched it and I have almost no recollections of what we watched except for a few. Among the recollections I do have was seeing a countdown for a rocket blast off. I also remember seeing a man and a woman in space suits with their helmets off inside of a rocket hugging each other. And this in fact, was the first clue in my life that I would go on to become a scientist. For many years I puzzled over what that movie might have been and about five years ago with the aide of the internet, I began making a search trying to figure out what it was and I went down a couple of dead-end leads. About two years ago I found a movie called Spaceways starring Howard Duff and Eva Bartok and I rented the movie from Netflix and the scenes that I still have in my memory banks are there in that movie. It also answered a, it answered a question for me which was very puzzling for years and years about my development. My mother as I had described was a person who was interested in artistic endeavors. She had no interest at all as far as I could tell in science and technology. So I had wondered for years why she would take her children to go see a movie about space rockets? And the answer turns out to be as far as I can tell because one of the stars of that movie was Howard Duff. Well Howard Duff was married to a woman named Ida Lupino and Ida Lupino was my father and mother's favorite actress and so it made perfect sense that she would go to this movie to see the husband of her favorite actress. And that's probably why we wound up being in that audience.
Speaker 1: That's interesting you know all the connections.
Speaker 2: Yeah. So I'm going--I actually have some things in the photographs that I'm going to give you related to that cause I figured you might want those things.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You asked me about other childhood movies--memories. I remember what sort of really made me wake up to the desire to become a scientist. So in 1958 or '59 [1959], we were living in Fort Bliss in El Paso and one day my father brought home some books on rockets and space travel. He had remembered that his four year old son had come home excited from the movies one day and tried to explain to him about rockets and countdowns and blast offs. And so he figured this child who was you know four years older might be interested in learning more about these things. So he brought home four books by an author named Willy Ley [Willy Otto Oskar Ley, German-American writer, spaceflight advocate and historian] and they were called Adventures in Space. And from reading his books I learned that the little dots of light in the night sky were places to which one might travel. And in my, between my own ears because of this, I had sort of a big bang. That is, I had some idea as an eight year old child of how big the universe must be because if those dots of lights were places and they were that small, then how big must this place be in which we live. And so I thought it might be interesting to go to those places and I knew that astronauts were the people who did that and so I wanted to be an astronaut. But I also knew that science had something to do to get to you to those places and so simultaneous those--simultaneous with that I had the wish to grow up to become a scientist.
Story_ID: 22206
Speaker 1: Now did you, do you remember the, all of the press coverage of Sputnik [the first artificial Earth satellite launched by the Soviet Union]?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was one of those children who was enraptured by the space race. Every time there was a National Geographic and people of my generation they remember that magazine that when they ran a story on space travel or the X15 or rockets or supersonic flames, I always found a way to get those copies and look at them and borrow them and read them over and over again. I was simply just absolutely enamored of the space race and the Telstar and the Jupiter Rockets and the Sergeant Missiles and all of those things, I was an expert by age eight or nine on those things.
Speaker 1: Now, yeah. So--yeah, Telstar I almost forgot about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But, so in '57 [1957] Sputnik is launched by the Russians.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I remember there was a commercial for Radio Free Europe--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --featured Khrushchev [Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev, first Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union] pounding his shoe--
Speaker 2: Absolutely. I remember those--
Speaker 1: --on the United Nations desk.
Speaker 2: I remember those things.
Speaker 1: And underneath it you know in a quote, "we will bury you."
Speaker 2: Of course.
Speaker 1: And people were very much afraid that the Russians would--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --bury us.
Speaker 2: And that had something to do with my, fifteen or twenty years later going to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, private research university] and I'll tell you that story. But yeah, I was involved with rockets and planes and stuff. And in fact I had fallen in love with airplanes from my first experience flying. When we had returned from St. Johns Newfoundland, we flew back on what--there's a type of plane called a boxcar. You don't see them anymore but they have two booms and the central part of the plane is supported between the wings in these booms. And so when we came back--
Speaker 1: That's a C something, a C--
Speaker 2: Oh I can look it up. I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Yeah, a C30 or a C--
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Any rate, I know what you're talking about.
Speaker 2: So we came--
Speaker 1: Flying boxcar.
Speaker 2: Flying boxcar. So when we came back from St. Johns Newfoundland, we came back on a flying boxcar. We had gone there on a ship so that was my first time at sea and experiencing sea sickness around 1953. But we came back on a flying boxcar and my father [Sylvester James Gates, Sr.] had asked the pilot cause this is after I had seen the rockets and what have you, asked the pilot could his son come up to the cockpit and look around and the pilot said yes. And so probably at age five or almost six, I found myself in the front of the plane and the boxcar is a very interesting thing because it has a window essentially at the pilot's feet. And so I had crawled around the side of the pilot seat on the left hand side of the plane and I had stuck my face right up against the window and I had, could watch what looked like the patchwork of a quilt passing below us as we flew back to the United States and I have never gotten over that experience so I fell in love with planes and rockets even prior to learning about the space age. So I was one of those space age kids.
Speaker 1: Okay. Did you see many planes on the army base?
Speaker 2: Absolutely. I can tell you all of them by name from just seeing them. I still remember the names, they were F86s and F100s, there were Star Fighters, there were Thunder Jets, there were Shooting Stars. These are all names of planes for people who know about these things back in the late 50s [1950s]. My favorite plane was something called a B-47 Stratojet. I still till this day think it's the most beautiful fighter bomber that's ever been built.
Speaker 1: Stratojet, I think--I'm trying to picture that in my mind.
Speaker 2: If you go on the web you'll see it. It's got swept back wings. It has the pylons that sit out on the wings with sets of four engines. And then further on the wings there are pylons with single engines. The wings drape. They have wheels on the outside and one of the most famous pictures of a Stratojet is what's called jet assisted take off or JATO. They used to have these banks of missile--of rockets on the body and in order to get the plane off on a really short runway they'll fire the rockets to build up the speed very quick, quickly. And so yeah I have all of these memories. These are all completely accessible to me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My other favorite plane is the B-17 however, from World War II period.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 22207
Speaker 1: Now did you watch Don Herbert's Show, 'Watch Mr. Wizard' on TV?
Speaker 2: I watched Mr. Wizard, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay. Was he--did he have any (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No super great impact. I was already interested in science without Mr. Wizard. In fact my interest in science really comes from science fiction because remember I told you that when I was four I had seen movies about rocket launches that had fascinated me. So one of the things that happened later in my life when I was learning to read is I had difficulty learning to read. I could do mathematics very easily but reading was a challenge so it's the opposite of the story that most people have to tell in their lives. And so one of the ways that I became a good reader was I discovered science fiction. And there were a series of books written for children about a character named Lucky Starr whose last name was spelled with two Rs. The author of this series was a man named Paul French and I was so enamored of the idea of space travel that my love for that idea drove in me an intense desire to learn to read. And of course once I had the desire then of course I learned to read very well. Many years later I found out that this guy Paul, that the name Paul French was a pseudonym and the actual author was a man named Isaac Asimov who is a very famous science fiction writer. And many years, well a few years ago, I had a chance to tell this story in New York City in front of an audience of about 2,000 where his daughter was in the audience.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Isaac Asimov was very famous. Now did you watch Twilight Zone?
Speaker 2: Absolutely I watched the Twilight Zone. Twilight Zone, Outer Limits, these things were in my childhood. Sign posts pointing a way towards the future, the future that I wanted because often the themes involved space travel. Another very influential series was something called Men Into Space starting William Lundigan and a more science fiction series called Rocky Jones starring Richard Crane. In my last, in my dotage of the last few years I've actually reacquired these things on DVD.
Speaker 1: Okay. There was an afterschool series I remember. Now we're almost the same age that's why I can--about a year apart. There's an afterschool series called Discovery that was on for a few years on ABC.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I have no recollection of it.
Speaker 1: And I think that's when I first saw liquid nitrogen you know and I mean it was really, it was real--about--they did real scientific experiments and it, you know, it was exciting to see that, but you don't remember that one?
Speaker 2: Not Discovery. I probably--if it was on and if it was about science, I probably watched it. There was another series called Science Fiction Theater which was very influential when I was young. There were things like Sea Hunt which was about this guy who was a skin diver starring Lloyd Nolan--
Speaker 1: It was Lloyd Bridges.
Speaker 2: Lloyd Bridges. That's right, Lloyd Bridges. There was a series about helicopter pilots called Whirlybirds.
Speaker 1: That's right. That's right.
Speaker 2: There was a program about a pilot in the west coast, Sky King.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: These were the things that I guess that pointed me towards the future I wanted.
Speaker 1: The smatterings of science on some of these shows, especially about people under--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I mean Sea Hunt especially--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --he discussed the dynamics of what he was doing.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, submarines and this whole sub-oceanic environment, yeah absolutely. And those are things that caught--that fascinated me when I was six, seven, eight, nine years old.
Speaker 1: How many minutes he could stay under water with a tank containing so much pressure.
Speaker 2: How deep could you go without having the bends? All of these things were I guess they were sign posts for me.
Speaker 1: When I was in the sixth grade, you were in the fifth grade, I don't know if you remember, a submarine that actually smashed like a tin can under the sea.
Speaker 2: Yes, I do. It was a thresher if I remember correctly.
Speaker 1: That's right. And I know our science teacher demonstrated how that happened with an actual can.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: They go in so deep and all of a sudden just (unclear, makes sound).
Speaker 2: Yes, I remember that.
Speaker 1: Yeah. So anyway these are all the things that are going on in science and so you were one of the kids that knew the Mercury 7, you know all of them?
Speaker 2: Oh, are you kidding? Alan Shepard--
Speaker 1: Right, I can name them John Glenn--
Speaker 2: Wally Schirra, John Glenn--
Speaker 1: Wally Schirra, right.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, absolutely. These are also things that National Geographic highlighted and so I would go and get my copies of National Geographic and now to show you kind of the strange mix of my father's and mother's traits, I was a very good artist when I was a child. And so when I would get a copy of National Geographic on a sheet of paper I would draw pictures of the rocket and the various devices so I'd have my own copies of these things. And in fact essentially it wasn't just drawing, they were essentially blueprints because I didn't just want to capture the shell, I wanted to know what was inside of them so I would draw what were call cutaway views where you could see the crew's compartments and the fuel in cells and the engines and these things would all be in my drawings.
Story_ID: 22208
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were talking about drawings coming up and I mentioned off camera, Jack Kirby.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Who was one of the greatest I guess--
Speaker 2: Well Jack Kirby in my opinion was the greatest comic book illustrator that has ever existed. His drawing have such a strong sense of perspective and he captured the human body from angles that are just, they're just impressive when you compare it to what most people drew. And yet, even though he was really great at perspective in human bodies, machines and devices were also his forte. So he could draw fantastical devices, particularly that you might see in the Fantastic Four that was led by a scientist character named Reed Richards. And so for a kid who was interested in science, you know it doesn't get better than that.
Speaker 1: That's right. That's right.
Story_ID: 22209
Speaker 1: So now in school, now we listed some schools that you--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You went to several schools.
Speaker 2: I can continue that list if you wish.
Speaker 1: Yeah. So we left here off at, your mom [Charlie Anglin Gates] passed when you were in the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so mom died--
Speaker 1: --in the sixth grade?
Speaker 2: I was in the sixth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was at Fannin Elementary in San Antonio, Texas when that happened.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's, okay Fannin.
Speaker 2: Fannin, named after the--
Speaker 1: F-A-N--
Speaker 2: F-A-N-N-I-N, named after the famous Fannin [James Walker Fannin] in Texas history.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so my mother died--actually my mother died when I was in fifth grade now when I think about.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's true.
Speaker 2: And we then--my, after a year my father [Sylvester James Gates, Sr.] remarried and we moved to Orlando, Florida to live with my stepmother and her mother. My stepmother's name was Edith Bradshaw and we lived at 560 West Carter Street in Orlando, Florida. It's a location that no longer exists because when they put in a new highway that was one of the buildings that was bulldozed to the ground to make way for access. But we moved to Orlando, Florida and so I spent the second half of my sixth grade year as a student where, in the school where my stepmother taught. And she taught in Hannibal Elementary in Winter Park, Florida so that's where I finished my elementary school experience.
Speaker 1: Hannibal.
Speaker 2: Hannibal Elementary.
Speaker 1: Elementary, okay.
Speaker 2: So that was the end of my elementary school education. Now I was always a very good student the entire time that we were busy moving, experiencing the death of my mother, having--during that year when dad was taking care of us I had a lot, as the oldest child I had a lot of responsibility for making sure that the house continued to function. And yet through all of that I was essentially a straight A student because school in fact was never hard for me. After I learned how to read in second grade, none of the rest of it was ever a challenge in elementary school. And so we moved to Orlando. That year was actually the first time I lived in a community that was essentially only African Americans. That's when I got to--a chance to see that African Americans came in all different shades and colors with various and sundry different textures of hair, with lips of various thickness and yet we were all black, you know. That's sort of an interesting realization. And it was also the first time that I tell people now I, that's when I learned to be black because culture which most people think of as intrinsic property actually isn't. And because of my childhood I, that was completely clear because when you would move from different places you would learn about the subtle differences and what was considered cool and what was not considered cool. So I was always actually very much aware that culture was something that one unconsciously made decisions about. So when we moved to Orlando, Florida it was the first time when I really encountered sort of traditional black culture and you know maybe previously I had been--I would have thought that the Beach Boys were pretty cool but within that cultural context, the Beach Boys weren't so cool anymore. First time I had got a chance to listen to R&B [Rhythm and Blues music] and blues and come to know people like The Temptations and the Four Tops and Aretha Franklin and you know these are cultural choices too but they're choices that one gets to make. Most people make these choices without realizing them but they're choices. I knew these were choices. And the other thing that was really incredibly important about my having this experience in my life is because it taught me some things about racism that had it not been for these experiences I think later in life I would have not been prepared for many things that happened. The thing that crystallizes this for me was an experience I had on the playground one day at Hannibal. So it's a segregated school. All the kids are black, all the teachers are black. And one day I was out on the playground, I had been at the school a couple of months and I was doing really my usual thing of doing the school worked well and passing all the tests and getting As. And there was this other young student in my class named Michael and we were outside playing and Michael said something like you know you're pretty good at that school stuff cause you're always passing the tests and getting high scores. And I said, you know kind of said well yeah, thank you. And he said but you know you can't be as smart as a white boy because you're going to always be two years behind. And I was stunned because what Michael didn't realize is that before I came to Hannibal Elementary I had always be the one or--I was among the one or two black students in a class where essentially everyone else was a Caucasian American and that I had in fact been the best or close to the best student in all of those classes. So when Michael made this statement I didn't, I could not comprehend what it was that he was saying until something clicked and I then understood what he meant. I understood that because he had grown up in an environment where he was only among African Americans that if someone told him that no matter how smart the smartest black kid was in that class, that student could never be as smart as the smartest kid in a class full of white students. And that crystallized for me a lot about how racism works in this country. It also crystallized for me an understanding of African Americans' participation in how racism plays out in this society because Michael had made an unconscious choice there and I knew that.
Story_ID: 22210
Speaker 1: Now around that same time the news I guess as you were growing up on the macro level--
Speaker 2: Civil rights, Martin Luther King.
Speaker 1: --similar yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, all that stuff was going on.
Speaker 1: The Montgomery bus boycott takes place--
Speaker 2: All that stuff was going on.
Speaker 1: --when you're five and then it keeps moving, the Freedom Rides.
Speaker 2: Freedom Riders, all that stuff is going--
Speaker 1: Sit ins, all this is going on.
Speaker 2: All that stuff was going on and I was aware of it in the sense of watching the news and knowing who Martin Luther King was you know hearing about the Freedom Riders and Rosa Parks and all of the horrible things that had, that occurred typically in the south. I don't remember knowing about Emmett Till at the time but I did probably when I was thirteen or fourteen know about Emmett Till. When I moved to Orlando [Florida] was when I first heard about the Tuskegee Airmen which our society as a whole even till this day doesn't, don't really know but these were things that we knew about in our young teenage years because this was knowledge that was endemic in the African American community. That's how I learned things about how even knowledge gets segregated from these experiences.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Now I imagine Orlando itself was a shock when--coming from a base situation, Orlando, Florida would have been a segregated town of the south?
Speaker 2: It was. Orlando was effectively segregated when we moved there. A lot of strange things about Orlando however, from my experience there as a child is though it was segregated it was a kind of understood and informal segregation. So for example the entire time I lived in Orlando as a teenager, I never got called a Nigger by any person other than a person who was of African American ethnicity. We knew where were the safe parts of the town where we wouldn't be harassed. We knew that you didn't want to get caught in other parts of town but there's not an overt, it was not overt racism that one had to deal with. One of the things about segregation which is very peculiar for people of my generation is that it meant that we had teachers that were off scale good. We had teacher--my, for example my geometry teacher was a woman named Edna Williams, a black woman, she was the first person who taught me about what the word logic actually meant in terms of mathematics. I had an algebra teacher by the name of Mr. Saunders. My English teacher, the one that comes to mind most often is, was Ms. Weaver whose dedication to grammar and pronunciation could not have preceded any bounds of possibilities because if you couldn't spell it, if you could not speak and speak grammatically correct, you heard about it from Ms. Weaver. These are the people who formed me intellectually and who I saw maintaining the highest standards of intellectual creativity, standards of intellectual performance, and demanded that I do the same. And these are black people who were telling me this. It's a very powerful message which I think often times African American students suffer because they don't know this, that this can happen. And so though segregation had it's terrible impacts on the African American community, it also had this very curious effect and I'm almost convinced this is true that the quality of teachers in the African American community in segregated times at least in the south was probably higher than it is now.
Speaker 1: Now let me ask you this, I don't know, I'm speculating about this now but I know that Orlando is a city in Florida that has grown by leaps and bounds.
Speaker 2: Oh, since Disney World has arrived.
Speaker 1: Yeah and but this is pre-Disney World yeah. So there's a--like Miami in some ways. Miami didn't exist until about 1920 as we think about it today in terms of it growing.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Orlando acquires Walt Disney I think in the mid-60s [1960s]--
Speaker 2: No sir. It did so in '71 [1971] cause I was already away in college.
Speaker 1: '71 [1971], okay. But it's, the Orlando we know now is a relatively new creation and--
Speaker 2: It's a different place.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Totally different place.
Speaker 1: But even then were they thinking more of a tour, as a tourist (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Not then. End of, up until the end of the 60s [1960s] Orlando was a backwater. The population was about 200,000 people in the greater metropolitan area and not very much happened there. As I said it was a place that the civil rights movement for example essentially bypassed. There were in my recollection few outbreaks of civil rights demonstrations. Oh there were some--
Speaker 1: Is St. Augustine nearby?
Speaker 2: No, St. Augustine's up north.
Speaker 1: Okay. Yeah there was a big, I know it was a big struggle in St. Augustine but it's rarely known. I mean most people don't know anything about it but it was a tremendous struggle.
Speaker 2: Yeah. No, but Orlando, it was not like that at all. In fact when the school system integrated in Orlando it was essentially nothing happened to the first approximation.
Speaker 1: Now was it a town that had signs like white water fountain, black and all that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: That didn't exist. I have no recollection of those things during my time in Orlando.
Speaker 1: Yeah. That was, I was kind of thinking it never was really like a true southern city.
Speaker 2: That--Orlando was actually very strange in that way because when I was there, there was a kind of comity among racial relations across the color line. You didn't see a lot of pushing back and forth and violence and you know things were under--there were rules and everyone understood the rules and everyone got along by those rules. There were you know, there were exceptions to that but I never personally experienced those.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We didn't go downtown to the big movie theater all the time. Once or twice we did. So that's why I said there were rules and people understood--
Speaker 1: Did they have a balcony policy?
Speaker 2: No. Well if they did we didn't, we were not subject to it cause I remember sitting, watching The Sound of Music in the big downtown theater and we were on the ground floor.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Okay.
Speaker 2: But Orlando for all of its comity and the way I remember it, I know at one point in the late 40s [1940s] after the Second World War, had one of the most active Ku Klux Klan [white supremacist hate group] chapters in the state. So Florida has a--Orlando has a very strange history when it comes to race relations.
Speaker 1: Okay. It certainly seems so.
Story_ID: 22211
Speaker 1: So, now you started high school at--?
Speaker 2: L.C. Jones High School.
Speaker 1: L.C. Jones.
Speaker 2: It is one of the traditional black high schools in the greater metropolitan area. It's over a hundred years old. One of the more recent graduates whose name you might have heard of is a guy named Wesley Snipes. Or he went to school there. I'm not sure he graduated. But Jones High School is where I was in school from grade 7 through 12. That's where I, this list of teachers I talked about all taught me at Jones High. And of course my--probably the teacher I admire most is the one I modeled myself after, Mr. Freeman Coney who was my physics teacher. I took free--I took physics in 11th grade and he introduced me to the ideas of Einstein [Albert Einstein, German born theoretical physicist] and quantum physics and this is an African American man with a Bachelors in physics, teaching high school.
Speaker 1: Now what was his last, how did he spell his last name?
Speaker 2: First name was Freeman, last name Coney, C-O-N-E-Y.
Speaker 1: Freeman Coney, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah. And so two years into that class, I mean sorry, two weeks into that class, it was clear to me I wanted to be a physicist.
Speaker 1: Now what did, you said he taught you about Einstein.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, not in words but the actual theories of Einstein. I learned about special relativity as a junior in a segregated southern black high school.
Speaker 1: Well I know even in those days the epitome of genius was carried with the name Einstein.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Somebody wanted to insult you because you're stupid, they say they'd call you Einstein.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: You know cause that's what you weren't you know. That's--
Speaker 2: Yes. Exactly and yet I found myself at age sixteen and seventeen understanding that I could understand personally what Albert Einstein did. I was the only student in the class who did it but I could do it. That was my stuff. That's amazing surprise.
Speaker 1: Okay. So how high could you go in mathematics at L.C. Jones?
Speaker 2: We didn't have calculus although Mr. Coney offered to teach me calculus outside of the regular curriculum but there as no formal course in calculus. So the most mathematics that you got to was analytical geometry and that was preceded by trigonometry, algebra I, algebra II and that was it.
Speaker 1: Okay. Did you take lessons from Mr. Coney in calculus?
Speaker 2: Yes and no. Mr. Coney--let me tell you a story that Mr. Coney tells me that I have no recollection of. Mr. Coney unfortunately has passed now but there's a story he used to tell about me. He said one day he was teaching and he noticed that there was a student in his book, in his class who had a comic book inside of the textbook and who was reading the comic book. And so he called--in order to embarrass the student into paying attention he called on the student to answer a question and the student answered the question without looking up. And so he said well I'll ask him a more difficult question. He asked a second question and the student answered without looking up. Then he said going to let it rip, asked the kid the hardest question associated with that part of the book. He asked the question, the student again asked--answered the question without looking up. At that point he said to himself or so the story goes, that kid might become a physicist and he was talking about me.
Speaker 1: Hmm, okay. All right, so but you didn't take his calculus course?
Speaker 2: No, because Mr. Coney made the offer. He had one of his calculus books that he had had when he was a student. He brought it to school and said Jim, because in fact I--around 10th grade I decided that people should call me Jim. Up until then it had been Sylvester. At 10th grade I decided my middle name was much simpler for people to manipulate and use, it was shorter to write, told everybody to call me Jim and they did. So Mr. Freeman said Jim, don't you want to learn this stuff? And he brought some books on calculus and I can actually--I have a recollection now of actually the one page in the book because the page that he--I recall was the page in which one learned how to integrate the curve Y equals X2 and you put little boxes on the curve. And I looked at it for a while and said no, I don't want to do this. And so I didn't--it, to me it's a very strange exception looking back on how I liked math. I decided I didn't want to do it. So I learned calculus the next year--two years ago later when I went away to college at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology].
Speaker 1: Hmm, okay. Someone we interviewed last week said--I mean earlier in the week said if you don't learn calculus in high school the train has left the station.
Speaker 2: It ain't true. I know that from personal experience. And I've heard that statement often but I know that it ain't true.
Story_ID: 22212
Speaker 1: So in high school I was a very interesting and strange construct. On the one hand because of my mother's [Charlie Anglin Gates] death and everything I had an extremely vivid life of the imagination. It involves reading science fiction, reading comic books, drawing, creating my own comic books because that was one way to get away from the pain of not having my mother. So I was very comfortable in what I used to think of as worlds that I built inside of my head. I was also essentially a straight A student and at some point I realized however that that combination probably wasn't going to be too popular with the rest of my classmates. And so I actually set out to construct another personality which I successfully did. This other personality for example became a fairly well recognized dancer because you got street cred if you could go to parties and dance. I also joined what was basically a high school version of a fraternity. It was called The Esquires and these were supposed to be the coolest guys on the campus. I was a member of that group. A friend of mine named Phillip Dunn and I created a chess club. It ain't so cool but Phillip was the smartest guy I had ever met up until that point in my life and therefore my natural competitiveness kicked in. He and I became ardent opponents on the chess board. He knew how to play chess, I didn't. He whipped me for a straight year up and down but at the end of that year I beat him for the first time using a very interesting maneuver on the chess board involving what's the called the pin which he didn't see coming which I had never read about but just figured out how it worked. And we had--we in fact created this chess club with a group of friends around us, including my youngest brother. Jones High had never had a chess club before then. We called ourselves Ajax A Lawah Nishivalia [phonetic]. No, Ajax A--yeah, A Lawah Chavalia. Ajax and the Black Knights because Phillip was very light skinned. The rest of us were about my complexion so the name of the chess club was in fact an inside joke among us who actually played chess.
Speaker 2: Ajax and the Black Knights.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: And is that a riff off the Ajax commercial with the white Knight making everything white (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Exactly. Exactly, that's what kids--that's what we did that kind of stuff. And our chess club which we just created challenged all the other chess clubs that the high schools had in the city and we never lost a match which was shocking because the black high school had never had a chess club at all. But we beat everybody else that we played chess with because we were ardent chess players. I mean Phillip and I--Phillip set the tone because we were dedicated to chess. I mean we--single, losing a single pawn could determine a match, a game. That was the level of chess we were playing. And so we encountered people at other places--chess was one of those games it was a great equalizer. It doesn't care what color your skin is. And so we won every match we ever played as a high school. So I had a girlfriend during my last two years of high school. I was an ardent party animal during the weekend. I was a straight A student. I didn't join the band and do stuff like that. I had a lot of friends who were band members.
Speaker 2: Did you do any art? Do anything in school?
Speaker 1: I didn't do any art, I did not except for my own personal art, things that I would draw for my own enjoyment and pleasure but I wouldn't share that with other people.
Speaker 2: Now--
Story_ID: 22213
Speaker 1: Now what about sports now? You know you're a big guy--
Speaker 2: I was a horrible--I wasn't then. I was a--
Speaker 1: You look like a big, strong guy--
Speaker 2: Well now I, in my dotage as I like to call it, I currently weigh about 196 lbs and I'm six feet tall. And in fact in the last year I've lost 32 lbs because I decided the numbers were getting too big for me to be comfortable. And so I said we're going to get rid of some of this stuff so I've been very happily--I know how to control that. But when I was a kid I was tall, skinny kid and totally uncoordinated. So whenever they were picking the basketball team, I was always the last kid to get picked cause they knew that I couldn't do anything on the basketball court. And in fact it had been even back when I was, before we moved to Orlando [Florida] it was clear to me I could never be an athlete because on one occasion when we were living--at that last elementary school whose name I can't remember, there was a, one day we were out in the baseball diamond. And there was a black kid up at bat who we called Slaughter Man Mike because Mike could hit the ball harder and faster than anybody in the school. So nobody wanted to go up against Slaughter Man Mike. So the pitcher winds up and delivers a perfect ball in the center of the batter's box and Mike crushes it and it makes a beeline towards me. And I'm here playing shortstop thinking oh my god I'm going to die. And so I hold the glove up the ball comes with such speed and force that it rips the glove right off my hand because I didn't securely hold the glove and the glove and the ball fall to the ground and Mike makes it to second base. So it was clear to me I was never going to be anybody's athlete. And accordingly I didn't--I used to like to play touch football which I did with my friends but for the varsity teams, no I was never going to do that stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We did have however, we had to do these things because physical fitness was required. So I had coaches that were very kind and recognized that they had this ungainly kid that had zero skill on any kind of field that you would put him on. So they would put me in things but they you know when I couldn't perform they didn't ride me about it or anything like that. My friends of course you know they had found that I couldn't do these things but when I--when we were doing unorganized things I liked to play quarterback in touch foot--and I actually had a pretty good arm. I was a pretty fast runner and in fact from the time when I was in elementary school I had won trophies cause I had been the fastest kid when I was living in Fort Bliss. But when high school came I was definitely not into athletics. There was no component of my personality that derived its self respect from those things.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 22214
Speaker 1: Now were you valedictorian of the class?
Speaker 2: I was the valedictorian of my class as you might guess. There was a young woman named Cassandra Williams who was a friend of mine who was a salutatorian. As valedictorian I had to give an address to the graduating class and in those days in Orlando [Florida] there was a large public coliseum where currently the Orlando Magic [basketball team] stadium is located so they bulldozed the old coliseum and built the arena there. But I gave a speech called 'The Seeker' for my valedictorian address and in some ways it was an allegory about my life because I think among, possibly among all my classmates I had been in more schools than anybody else and probably seen more of the world than most of them because in that, certainly in that point most African Americans in the south didn't do a whole lot of traveling. I had many friends who had never been on an airplane, had never been on a ship. I had done all these things by the time I was five. And so the valedictorian address was partly allegory about my life and traveling and statements about where I wanted to go next.
Story_ID: 22215
Speaker 1: Alright. Now we just talked about your valedictorian speech and--
Speaker 2: Yes, the speaker.
Speaker 1: Yeah. And so the--is there anything else about that? Now you said it was more of an autobiographical, an allegorical life story?
Speaker 2: Yes. It was an allegorical story about this character. It was partly based on my reading of comic books. One of the characters that showed up in the Fantastic Four is a character named Prester John. Prester John is a traveler and so the speech was partly about Prester John and me and a number of things and as I said it was a vision and an allegory about life and where I wanted to go next and an exhortation to my classmates that they needed to dream big and think of going far.
Speaker 1: Hmm, where are you going next?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's part of the, one of the measures of intelligence how you can anticipate what you're going to do. We all--anticipation of what comes next.
Story_ID: 22216
Speaker 1: So now how did you make a decision about what to do next in terms of school (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Sure. So I, in 1969, I, that summer, I went to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] for the first time. And it was the culmination of a dream that I had held from the time I was fourteen years old. When I was fourteen like most young men at that age, I had a fascination with TV so I watched a lot of it. There was this one show called Make Room for Daddy that starred a man named Danny Thomas and in one episode it was about a nephew of his that came to visit the family and this nephew was supposed to be a genius. And he went to this school called the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. And at the school I learned that they had just the good stuff that you had to study. You could study mathematics and science and you didn't have to worry so much about that English and history and all--just what I thought about as the good stuff. And I said this is college where you could learn the good stuff? That's where I want to go to school. So at fourteen, I learned about MIT and I told my dad, that's where I want to go to college. By age eighteen, I understood many more things about the role of race in this country and what that meant at the intersection of opportunity. And so even though I had come from an intact family with a father who fiercely loved his children, with a stepmother who had, in my--as I described to some people, provided a safe harbor in--after a time of stormy seas, even though I had all of these people who had been raising and protecting me, I had bought into the kinds of low expectations that this society often tells young people of the African Diaspora, this must be your fate. So during my senior year of high school I had taken the SAT test as well as the Achievement test to make college applications after graduation.
Speaker 1: Was that the ACT?
Speaker 2: No, no, SAT and Achievement. Achievement was a different test from the ACT.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.
Speaker 2: And I did pretty well on the SATs and I did very, very well on the physics achievement test which after all I had taken physics as a junior. It was right in line with my love for science so why would I not do well on the physics test. And I did. So one day when I was in 12th grade I got a call to come to the principal's office and my friends looked at me and they were like, Ooh, what did you do? Because you know if you were called to the principal's office in high school it was usually not a good occasion. Not--it wasn't something that you were coming to get some reward for; precisely the opposite. So I got there and the principal gave me a bunch of letters and these letters were from colleges to who--that had received my scores on the SATs and the Achievement test and these were letters inviting me to apply for application. I was stunned because I didn't expect anything like that to happen. And in fact, I had never heard of that sort of thing happening except to athletes where colleges obviously come to try to get athletes to apply. But a kid who gets high scores on the SAT, I never heard of anything like that. So this went on actually for a couple of weeks and I'd get the letters and I'd take them home and show them to my parents and among those letters was one from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. And so I had just laid it aside because as I told my--well my father after a couple of weeks said well are you going to apply and I said no dad, they don't let people like us go to places like that. And he said isn't that the school that you were talking about when you were fourteen? I said yeah it's the same school and he said well you're going to apply because the only thing that will happen is they can tell you no. But you can get past that. And so I would have fallen into one of the traps that you often hear about young African American men falling into about wanting to be too, too much fear into failing and therefore wanting to be too cool to fail. And my dad saw right through it. And so he rendered again a valuable service, said you're going to do this. There's no questions. And dad had been a strict disciplinarian the entire time that he was raising us so when dad said something it was never a question about whether you were going to do something opposite. So I applied to MIT and in the spring of 1969, one day I came home from school and my father was sitting on the front porch in a rocking couch. If you've ever been in the south you know there's a great tradition of rocking chairs and rocking couches on the front porch. So dad was sitting on a rocking couch with a huge smile on his face and what was odd was that my father was never home before I, was never home before I came home from school and so he was there rocking with this smile. And as soon as I saw his face I knew I had been admitted to MIT and I ran over to him and got a big bear hug. And so, this dream that this fourteen year old crazy little kid had had was going to come true.
Story_ID: 22217
Speaker 1: And during the summer, June of 1969, I went up to Boston [Massachusetts]. During my teenage years we had been told that Boston was the Athens of America, the place of high culture and high learning where you know you had expectations perhaps that you were going to Mt. Olympus. Well I was soon disabused of that notion. In fact, I encountered more overt racism in Boston than I had ever encountered at any point previous in my life.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so many people say that. It's you know--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.
Speaker 2: I guess in the view of black people especially during that era.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
Speaker 2: Home of the Kennedys and the liberalism of Massachusetts, everybody sees, you know--
Speaker 1: No. You go, if you went to live in Boston you got a real quick message about how race, how deeply held racism was a common view among Caucasian Americans who lived there. And of course the thing that's very strange about the city is that it's a collection of villages. So you have the Irish, you have the Italians, have the Greeks and it's not clear that anybody likes anybody. So you're, you know so you're kind of in that mix. But sure, racism was the order of the day and unhidden. I mean you know they were very proud to show it. You couldn't go to the Red Sox game without having someone throw something down on you. That was Boston in that period. And--
Speaker 2: They're the last team to hire a black player too.
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly. And--
Speaker 2: And did, now let me just interrupt for a minute. Did you--what were your thoughts about say the assassination of President Kennedy [John Fitzgerald "Jack" Kennedy, 35th President of the United States]? I guess you were twelve when that happened?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll never forget that day like most Americans who lived through the assassination of President [John Fitzgerald] Kennedy. I remember the day because I had come home from school. It was an extremely hot day so I have this, had this recollection of dragging myself cause we had to walk between home and school, dragging myself into the house and turning on the TV and hearing that the President of the United States had been shot and killed. I couldn't believe it because that's the kind of thing you read about in history books. That didn't happen in America. We didn't shoot and kill our presidents. And yet, an American president had been killed like hundreds of millions of other Americans I'd turn on the TV and there's Walter Cronkite [Walter Leland Cronkite, former American broadcast journalist] telling the story about the death of Kennedy and what was known and the whole process of grieving and the country had a new president named Johnson [Lyndon Baines Johnson, 36th President of the United States] who was from Texas and didn't know who or what this guy was going to do. And perhaps it's an irony that many Americans don't recognize that President Johnson was probably the greatest civil rights president this country has ever had. The Civil Rights Act didn't pass under Kennedy, it passed under Johnson. And it wasn't that he was just the guy who showed up. These were things he actively pushed. And so yeah I watched all of that. I watched--then of course there was the assassination of Mal--of Martin [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., American clergyman and civil rights activist] and Malcolm [Malcolm X, born Malcolm Little, also known as El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz, Muslim minister and civil rights activist]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Malcolm X in '65 [1965] and--
Speaker 1: --much later, yeah. So all of those things were going on.
Speaker 2: And Dr.--most people, the assassination--
Speaker 1: King?
Speaker 2: --of Malcolm X slipped past a lot of people our age cause we--
Speaker 1: No, it didn't slip past me.
Speaker 2: Okay. So your father was or did your family really keenly understand who he was?
Speaker 1: Not so much my family. I was--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --I was a watcher kind of kid. I mean if there was information out there, I was watching. That's what I mean by I was a watcher so I knew lots of things that--
Speaker 2: Cause I, as I--so did you ever see him on television before he was assassinated?
Speaker 1: Yes, once.
Story_ID: 22218
Speaker 1: Let me tell you a post-script to that, that viewing of Malcolm's [Malcolm X] image on TV. So in 1969 I was admitted to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] and they had a summer program called Project Interphase which was created sort of as a transitional program for students who didn't come from the kind of backgrounds most MIT students came from. And it was created actually by African American students and when I got to the airport I was met by one of the African American students at MIT who had created the program and a man by the name of Fred Johnson. Fred bore a striking resemblance to Malcolm X. And so you know I'm walking the airport and I'm like why is this Malcolm X guy telling me he's from MIT, right? But that's the way it happened. And so when I got to MIT it was a, that summer was the most difficult academic experience I had ever had. I had to work hard for the first time in school ever. Well first time since second grade perhaps but it felt like the first time ever having to work hard to learn things. The amount of things that you had to learn at the level you had to learn was just unlike anything I had ever experienced before in my life. And I had still this deeply held love for physics. I struggled enormously that summer. In fact by the end of the summer I was physically ill. I was essentially exhausted. And I had passed all the courses they taught so I had gotten credit and there was a break period before the classes resumed. So I returned to Orlando and when I went home I slept for three solid days. And on the fourth day my father--I mean I would wake up but then I'd immediately go back to sleep. So on the fourth--and I would eat dinner but then I would go back to sleep. And so the fourth day my father came into my bedroom and said son what, you know what did they do to you there? And I said I'm just tired dad. And he said you know if this place is going to make you sick I don't want you to go back. And I was stunned because it was the first time in my life my father had said anything other than do your best. Get back in there and do your best. He gave me permission to fail. I had never heard that from him before. And it was, to me such a remarkable statement that I felt like well gee there's nothing to lose now because he said it's okay if I fail! So I entered in the fall, struggled some more. First semester I had my calculus course. Half of the course I got through pretty easily but the second half of the course which was on integrals presented a problem for the first couple of weeks.
Story_ID: 22219
Speaker 1: And yet I, through a very strange experience with a dream, eventually I learned how to integrate very well. It was--
Speaker 2: Hmm, wait now, in a dream?
Speaker 1: In a dream essentially I learned to integrate. That's the only way I know to describe it. I could get, I could say more if you think it's interesting.
Speaker 2: Sure, it is.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There are you know dream studies about how we reorder things that happen in our lives.
Speaker 1: Okay, so-
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: --I had a test coming and I knew I was going to be tested on this integer stuff and up until that point I had been a total failure trying to figure out what it meant. So I had this terrible headache which I now recognize as a migraine and I fell asleep. And in this sleep I had this dream and the dream was me and this voice that I couldn't see the person to whom it belonged and we were standing at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] looking away from the main part of the campus, except that it was not the MIT that I had seen. It was some version of MIT in the far distant future. And the voice said yes, that's what MIT is going to look like and the date was something like a hundred years, it was like 2070 or so. That's what MIT is going to look like. And I said, wow. And then when I woke up, I could integrate anything. I mean any integer you could put in front of me I could do if it was doable and that dream had something to do with that. So I took four courses for credit in the first semester. I passed all my courses because MIT in your freshman year only gives you pass/failing grades. They want to take some of the pressure off of freshmen. But I also found out that I had not had to work as hard as I had during the summer beforehand in the transitional program. So the second semester I took an overload of courses. I think I took six courses as opposed to five which is the traditional number. And one of those courses was a course called differential equations which is the gateway to essentially higher mathematical--mathematically based science and engineering courses. And I took the course during my freshman, the second term of my freshman year and I passed. And so I'm set up to do science at MIT at the end of my freshman year having come from this black high school that was totally segregated where a lot of people never expected someone like me to succeed.
Speaker 2: Okay. So you knew that was--
Speaker 1: At that point--
Speaker 2: --that was the hurdle?
Speaker 1: --I knew I was going to make it through MIT. That was the point when I knew I was going to make it through MIT. That summer beforehand had been the crisis point of the question about whether I could because they had worked me so hard in that program. I remember, I had a diary at that time and I remember writing in that diary that as I looked towards the fall I could see mountains in the distance with the names like calculus and chemistry and physics on them and I didn't know if I was going to be able to climb those mountains.
Story_ID: 22220
Speaker 1: I just wonder, I mean I read--and I have to tell you about this off camera probably. It's a long story. But, about Norbert Weiner who was I think twelve when he went to MIT or something and I'm just wondering if you encountered any geniuses like that at MIT?
Speaker 2: I did, one in my time there. I encountered one such genius. I don't know who--I don't remember his name but a few years later when I was in graduate school there was this kid that was no more than fourteen who was taking graduate courses in the same class with me.
Speaker 1: Graduate courses?
Speaker 2: Graduate courses. Not undergrad, graduate courses, graduate math courses. So like I said by the end of my freshman year I knew I was going to make it through MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology]. Now I didn't say it was going to be pretty but I knew I was not going to flunk out. I had come to MIT with the expectation of being the dumbest and slowest student in every class that I was going to be in. And what I found was that's just not true. That in fact it was often the case that I would, you know I wasn't always a top student like I had been when I was in elementary school and high school but I was far from being the bottom student. And so I knew that this was a place where I could play, where that good stuff that I had dreamed about as a fourteen year old, that good stuff was not right--it's like being in the candy store and it's alright here and it's mine. All I got to do is reach out and get it, and that's what I did. And actually--but I also was thinking about graduate school because you got to think ahead too. So I noticed by the end of my sophomore year that my grades in mathematics were higher than my grades in physics and so I declared myself a math major because I knew that grades had something to do with getting into graduate school and you got to have good ones. And--but I loved physics so I continued to take physics courses even though I was a math major. So I would you know, I took all the required courses of a math major and then for fun I would take all the physics courses. In my senior year a friend of mine by the name of Inez Hope one day asked me, what discipline I was going to receive my degree in because she had seen me in all these physics courses. And I said oh I'm a math major. I'm going to get a math degree. She said really? Didn't I see you in all those physics course? I said oh yeah, I was doing that cause I just wanted to learn some physics. She said I bet they'll let you get both degrees. And I had never heard of anyone getting two degrees in four years. So she said what you need to do is go over to the physics headquarters and show them your transcripts. So I went over to the physics headquarters, I showed them my transcript and the lady said, oh yeah you look just like a physics major. All you got to do is take the labs in your senior year. And so that's how I accidentally wound up with a Bachelors of Mathematics and a Bachelors of Physics in four years at MIT because one I was planning for the future, but two, I was thinking about what I really loved.
Story_ID: 22221
Speaker 1: And I did a lot of other interesting things at MIT. We started the--so this is the 19, early 1970s, this is nation time. This is the time of the RNA, Republic of New Africa and the Black Panthers and the Nation of Islam. And all of that stuff is going on at the campus with the shootings at Kent State. But people often forget there were shootings at Jackson State a few days before the shooting at Kent State.Yes sir.
Speaker 2: And there were other shootings on black campuses around the same time. It was a time of Cambodian, the incursion. On our campus it was a time when you could see the police in riot gear enter the campus dressed as if they were storm troopers with batons and tear gun, tear gas guns and shooting students with these things and beating students so that one of the things that I'll never forget my freshman year was thinking, I now know what the phrase the power of the state means, when you watch that kind of activity being exercised by police forces against citizens who are not breaking the law. Those are the times in which I was a college student and mostly in my freshman and sophomore year. At the point of the incursion into Cambodia, there was a national call for college students to go on strike and not go to class. And this call was listened to on most campuses and including MIT. And so one day I was on my way to class and one of my white classmates stopped me, said don't you know about the moratorium? I said yeah I know about it. He said well why aren't you staying out of class? And I said well what you don't understand is that too many people who look like me have died, have been beat, have paid an enormous price so that I can be at a place like this. And I said I know this and I wouldn't consider not going to class, and I did. So being an undergraduate at MIT in that time was unlike--it was surreal. I mean the numbers of stories I could tell you were just amazing. Let me just talk about one thing though, a couple of things that were important for me. So I was busy learning. I was increasing my knowledge of physics and mathematics. It was not easy. In fact, I almost had a nervous breakdown several times. And one of the strategies I developed to avoid that was every semester I was an undergraduate I would take two weeks and not to go to class. I would simply ditch class. I wouldn't do anything that had to go to school because it was--cause I needed it for mental health time. I would never schedule this when there were tests coming. But I took this time because I needed it personally and I recognized the need for that. I had great comradeship with my fellow African American students. Our class of 1969 was the first time MIT had admitted more than two or three African Americans in their entering class. There were about 50 of us. Four years later, only 35 of us graduate--30, between 30 and 35 graduated. But we had a great bond of kinship, comradeship because it was like going to war and these are the men and woman who were in the foxhole with you. We encountered some acts of overt racism, covert racism. I mean it was quite common for the campus police if there were groups of more than two or three of us walking across campus late at night, the campus police wonders, who are these people and what are they doing here?
Story_ID: 22222
Speaker 1: There was a funny incident during my freshman year. There had been a tradition that on the night before the first set of midterms, upper classmen would throw freshmen into the shower stalls with their clothes on. So most of us African American students made it known to our Caucasian American classmates that we weren't going to participate in this activity. But not all of them got that message and there was a group in what was called east campus which is one of the dormitories at MIT where a group of Caucasian American students were bound and determined that they were going to throw these three African American students in the shower. So the three students locked themselves in one of the dormitory rooms and in those days most of the African American students lived on the west side of campus. That's where I was in the dorm. So they called us and said you know we're being attacked. Can you come and help? It was a slightly rainy night so we all, those you know all of us who got the call got up and ran across the campus to help our fellow classmates. And since it was raining we had umbrellas and when we first filed into the room, into the hallway outside the room, it was clear that this group of Caucasian American students were not pleased to see us and were still determined to go ahead with their plans and so there were a few tense moments. But as more of us entered the hallway, it became clear that they did not have a stomach for a physical engagement. And one of them called the campus police saying you know there's this group of black guys who look dangerous cause after all we always look dangerous. And the campus police showed up pretty quickly and of course nothing happened cause we didn't come there for a fight. We came to protect our friends. And our friends came out of the room and explained the situation and the campus police said well you know, you guys just all need to disperse and we all did, including the Caucasian American students who at that point decided that it wasn't such a good idea to follow this tradition. And the next day in the campus paper, one of the stories was about this group of marauding black students who had shown up in the east campus with knives hidden inside their umbrellas. I mean you know we're like wow, where do they get that stuff from because you know, I was in one of those marauding group of black students so I had been there and I know that none of us had any knives in our umbrellas.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: So that's the kind of stuff that went on outside of the academics at MIT.
Speaker 2: Now tell--
Speaker 1: Boston is a college town. There were enormous numbers of African American students. Remember I used to dance in high school? I kept that, I kept up that tradition when I was an undergraduate.
Speaker 2: You got Harvard Tufts, Northeastern--
Speaker 1: Harvard Tufts, Northeastern, Boston College, Simmons, I mean there's at least a dozen and so when the weekend came for me, the question was, where is the party at, cause I still remembered how to dance from high school. I--and again it was partly the process of maintaining my internal balance. I was taking care of me by having fun. So, all that stuff was going on.
Story_ID: 22223
Speaker 1: Alright. So I've heard other scientists say that when you get immersed into physics sometimes you lose sight of other things and even the problem of racism seems to melt away among physicists in a laboratory. Now this is what people say now. I'm just saying, was that your experience?
Speaker 2: Well yes and no. First of all because of the way that I dealt with the social environment in which I found myself, I was in multiple communities still. So for example I had friends who were Black Panthers. I had friends who were members of the Republic of New Africa. So I had friends who were calling for a nation time and revolution and though I thought they were badly informed about the prospects of making a fundamental difference as well as making bad choices about how to make a difference, I heard and understood what they were saying. Independent of that part of me, I was busy learning a whole lot of physics. So the world didn't disappear when I became fully engaged in physics because in fact, I was fully engaged in physics from the time I first got to MIT. But for me it was a serial focus, namely, it was a spotlight that I could turn to the subject. When I was doing physics I was completely and a hundred percent engaged in doing physics. But when I had that spotlight elsewhere, I was not doing physics and I was doing other things. Taking care as I said of being a person, the person that I had come to know that I was.
Speaker 1: Now did you take courses in liberal arts in terms of--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --African studies or history or anything--
Speaker 2: No. I took one or two courses.
Speaker 1: --when you were at--?
Speaker 2: I took a course in African religions and that was the first time I heard (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, because our teacher was from South Africa. I took a few courses in history because history in fact has always been a hobby of mine. But no, I--remember when I was fourteen, I had some of the good stuff. At age nineteen, twenty, twenty one, I was still talking about the same good stuff so it was calculus, it was analysis, it was partial differential equations, it was linear algebra, it was Hilbert spaces, it was Sturm-Liouville theory and boundary conditions and Neumann conditions and Schrodinger's equation, relativity, particle physics. These were things that for me were, they were like the merry-go-round and the swing and the monkey bars that children play on. These are the things that were in my analogs in my early twenties when I was at MIT.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And just as children lose themselves in play completely when they're doing it, I was completely lost in that world when I was doing it.
Story_ID: 22224
Speaker 1: Okay. Now who were, and there's got to be some, mentors or role models in the physics and math department at MIT for you?
Speaker 2: Well yes and no. For a long time in my life I didn't really believe in the concept of mentors but the reason after I thought about it for a long time was that I had always had so many I hadn't noticed. So who were the people who were critical in my life as a--first is my father by far because he created this space in which a young intellect could develop and he created the environment where intellectual talent and ability was seen to be of enormous value in our household. So my dad by far was my first mentor even though I did not understand it at the time. Then there were a whole host of teachers in high school whose names I've called earlier. But when I got to college, the people that were sort of playing that analogous role, first was Dr. Shirley Jackson. Shirley Jackson taught me physics in the summer of 1969 in that Project Interphase Program that I talked about earlier. Aside from Shirley, there were a couple of other people. There was a professor by the name of Margaret--ah, I'm sorry let me back up. The professor who taught me during my freshman year of physics whose name I cannot remember right now, did something very special for me during my freshman year. Kistiakowsky, Dr. Vera Kistiakowsky, one of the few women on factually at MIT in those days.
Speaker 1: Vera--
Speaker 2: I don't--Kistiakowsky.
Speaker 1: --Kistiakowsky.
Speaker 2: --kowsky, yeah. So Dr. Kistiakowsky was my recitation instructor in the first physics class which at MIT is called 801. And during the first half of the class I had struggled because the way physics was taught and thought about at MIT was far beyond anything I had encountered in high school and it had been two years ago that I had taken a physics course. So I had struggled and when midterm came you had to meet with your instructor and have a counseling session. And I, so I met with her and she looked at my homework and she said you know your homework is always really good but boy what's going on with you and these tests? And I just said you know I don't know. And in fact the entire time I was a student, I never did well at tests it turns out but that was the first time in my life that showed up. And so she said well what are you doing to get past this? And I described some things. She said well you know look you can come talk to me whenever you feel like it about physics and I'll try to help you get past whatever these things are that have you hung up on the tests. Now I never actually went to her but she made the offer. Unbidden she made the offer so I felt the door was open. And at the end of the course when I took my final, I blew the final out of the water. It's one of the few occasions in my life when test anxiety wasn't there. And so at the end of the course when it came time to meet with your teacher for the last time, I walked into her office and she had the biggest smile on her face because clearly she took great joy in the fact that this student had mastered this stuff that had caused him to struggle during the first half of the course. So she was a mentor to me. Later, Margaret McVicker, another professor played a great role in mentoring me. There was, they were two male professors whose names I cannot recall. One of them had been a vice president at MIT at one point and they were the people who basically opened up the, a path for me to go to graduate school. So they played an absolutely critical role in my life. I--this was not the first time my biography has been solicited. And in fact, a large part of my MIT biography is in a book called "Technology and the Dream" by Clarence Williams and so their names are in there. I can't remember them right now. But these were some of the people who made sure that that skinny black kid from Orlando [Florida] could find his way through the world, one of the world's leading institutions in science and technology.
Speaker 1: Now did you graduate with any honors in '73 [1973] when you--?
Speaker 2: No, not especially. I mean I graduated with something like B averages so I mean you know I had successfully avoided Cs mostly. I got my degree in mathematics first and then because of my sort of strange nature in physics, I didn't actually get my physics degree in the summer but by the end of the summer I had lab work to complete. So I had completed my lab work by the end of summer and started graduate school just a few weeks later.
Story_ID: 22225
Speaker 1: Now it's odd and somewhat odd, some or for people to--well not odd but not everyone does that, just goes right on to graduate school in the same school.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: You know but you did and--
Speaker 2: Yes, it is unusual. It's not, like you say it's not completely odd but it is very unusual. But you see, I had had a very strange relationship with MIT in the following sense. So I started MIT the summer before I was a freshman at an in transition program. The summer after my freshman year I went home but every summer after that I was at MIT teaching in that same transitional program I told you about. That's why this is my 40th consecutive year of teaching either mathematics or physics to university students because from the summer of 1972 to the present, I have been teaching people either calculus, mathematics or physics. So because of that I spent more time on the campus than most students. I had become completely comfortable with the place as a student. And I had a chance to work, because of my summer experiences, I had had a chance to work with MIT faculty outside of being one of their students, but in fact being a teaching assistant. And one of those faculty members paid me very great compliment, favor and was a mentor because he gave me some math problems that were pretty hard problems and I solved them. And he said you know you're pretty good. I later found out that some of these problems were what we call Putnam exam problems because you're among the most difficult problems that young undergraduate students encounter in what's called the Putnam Competition. And so he was able to make an assessment of the potential ability I might have in these areas and he let me know that I was pretty good. So you know there were a sequence of a series of mentors and the final one was an African American. All of the rest of them are European Americans. My final mentor at MIT who later would be my graduate Ph.D. advisor was a gentleman by the name of James Edward Young who by the way, was also the advisor to Dr. Shirley Jackson. So Dr. Jackson and I are both technically students of the same person.
Story_ID: 22226
Speaker 1: Okay, James Edward Young. Now can you give us a little bit about his background as far as--as much as you know?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes. Jim was first a madman. That's where I'm going to start. The first time I encountered Jim I was still an undergraduate and he was visiting the campus and he had processed hair flaming red or some strange orange red color. And he came to our class and this was of course on electricity and magnetism and he gave a lecture that no one, no student in the class understood a single word. And I remember thinking, god, I'm glad I don't have to see that guy again. Jim had a Ph.D. from MIT, had spent time at the Los Alamos Laboratory and had come back to MIT as a professor. He had a, he had worked in a number of different areas of physics. By the time I met him he was interested in particle physics but he had also done work earlier in some aspects of nuclear physics as well as sonic physics and a number of things. I think he also has a Masters degree from Howard [University] if I remember correctly. He finished at MIT in the late 40s [1940s], again is my recollection and Jim is still alive. Jim is a very unusual man. But--
Speaker 1: You have to give us his contact information so we can talk to him.
Speaker 2: If I can because Jim tends not to be contactable. I saw Jim for the first time in fifteen years ago, about ten months ago and I'll try to see if I can find contact. Jim basically likes to live off the grid. In fact, I've urged him and I'm not the only one to--his is an autobiography that really needs to be captured because first of all he's, you know he's very mature now, a very mature man and he came into the system at a time when there were essentially no African Americans getting Ph.D.s from places like MIT, but he did.
Speaker 1: With the orange process?
Speaker 2: Not at the time he was a student, but when he came back on faculty, oh yeah. Jim was a wild man, very unusual person, very smart guy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 22227
Speaker 1: So, but he guided you through your Ph.D. process?
Speaker 2: Yes and no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So when, so I was, so I began graduate school at MIT in 1973. I found graduate school easier than being an undergraduate, part of the time, partly because I had spent so much time at MIT as an undergraduate, partly because I had actually learned a whole lot of stuff when I was an undergraduate. It was easy in the sense that it was not as challenging as when I first came to MIT. But it was not easy because typically for example during the first year that I was a graduate student, I was staying up three nights a week to complete my homework because every week you had a homework assignment to do. And my modus operandi was I never started my homework before midnight so I was pulling all, what we called pulling all-nighters and that's how I got my homework done. But I always got really good grades on my homework. So I always felt like my mind was fully awake at around two or three in the morning. In fact, till this day I still think it's true. So, graduate school had not been the same kind of challenge that going to undergraduate school had been except for two events. In order to get a Ph.D. you have to pass what's called a Qualifying Exam or a General Examination and the first time I took the qualifying exam I did not pass which had, was an enormous disaster in my life because all my life up to that point had been aimed at me becoming a Ph.D. physicist, had been the thing closest to my heart's desire and yet I had not been able to pass this test which was the gateway to doing that. So I was badly beat up emotionally but I'm not the kind of person that gives up. So I said the next time the exam was going to be scheduled I was going to sign up for it. And it just so happened that another African American student also signed up to take the exam because he too had not passed on the first time. His name was Ronald McNair. And I had actually first met Ron around 1973 or '72 [1972] so I had known Ron because he was on a summer program at MIT and I was on a different summer program and he and I, together with a few other people had sort of developed this food co-op where we pooled all our money and bought fresh vegetables and food and you know fed the lot of us cause we didn't have a lot of money so that was one way to get more bang for the buck. In 1973, Ron began graduate school the same year I did and we, although we didn't take class--we took maybe one or two classes together. But around '75 [1975] when we were trying to pass the Ph.D. qualifying exam, we had been in separate classes. So I found out that he was preparing for the qualifying exam and I can't remember whether he asked me or I asked him but I said well why don't we study--somehow we decided it was a good idea to study together so we formed a two person study group. And so in January of 1975, every day Ron McNair and I went to the physics reading room which was like a small library where they had rooms that you could reserve so that you wouldn't be disturbed and we studied for the qualifying exam. Our typical pattern was that we would show up around 9:30 in the morning, we would put a problem on the board. We would each retire to different parts of the room for maybe forty minutes, an hour, whatever and then try to write a solution and then get--start to compare notes. And this was the first time in my life I ever worked with anybody else on anything and I was amazed because I never knew that there was actually value to talking to other people. But I learned that lesson from working with Ron because typically when we--so you now sometimes he would get the problem right. Sometimes I would get it right. But the thing to me was amazing was we would approach these problems in almost diametrically opposed different ways and yet wind up with the same answer. And what I learned from this experience is to do what I call, simulate the second voice. Because the thing I learned from Ron is there's more than one way to solve a problem and that, one of the things that you can do to solve problems when you don't know how is to try to simulate a point of view of another person. So I call that simulate the second voice. And so we went through the entire month. We studied together. One day--there's this corridor at MIT it's called the corridor. It's a long hallway which is the main axis of the campus. And so as we were studying this period, some, at some point a number of our friends had observed us everyday going back and forth and back and forth. So one day one of our friends said what are you guys doing? It's like you guys got jobs. You know at such and such time every morning you're going that way and at 12 noon you're coming back this way. At 1 o'clock you're going back that way. What are you guys doing? And I said something like well we're studying for our Ph.D. qualifying exam. And the friend said well gee, you know you don't have to make it into a job. And Ron without missing a beat said, oh yeah these are jobs. Our jobs are success and we went back to studying. So the test was administered. I passed the test. I thought Ron had too but it turns out the story is more complicated than that. As I found out two years ago because Ron's brother, Carl is someone I know. And so Carl and I were actually talking about those times and so there's a story there, but eventually Ron also passed. So in 1977 when I got my Ph.D., Ron McNair was also getting his Ph.D. And in fact there used to exist a photograph of the two of us side by side walking towards the graduation ceremony that one of the black deans at MIT kept in his office for many years. And that photograph has been lost but I, boy I wish I had it.
Story_ID: 22228
Speaker 1: Well tell us know what were you working on? We haven't discussed any physics here.
Speaker 2: Ah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So now is the time for you to, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You are, now I'm going to spoil this by saying that you have been touted as a person who can best explain you know some of the deeper physical, I mean physics problems that we are talking about now.
Speaker 2: Well, I've appeared on a number of science documentaries and one of the people I've worked with is a producer at the Nova program that PBS, the Public Broadcasting System. And Joe's comment is that I am maybe the best person he's ever met at making science of the most obscure nature understandable to people who are not scientists.
Speaker 1: Yeah. I mean I think there's a tendency that people who see Nova like me, to tell their kids, here's this guy with the hair, listen to him. And then, yeah and then--cause I didn't even know your name at first. I said there's a brother on here with his hair who knows what he's talking about and he's, you know he's on NOVA and appears--you know, you, Neil deGrasse Tyson [astrophysicist and science communicator] are the people that appear the most but you know Neil deGrasse Tyson has more of a media presence so everybody--
Speaker 2: He is, yeah.
Speaker 1: --kind of knows his name.
Speaker 2: Neil is, Neil does--you know Neil is, his job basically is interacting with the public and media. I'm still a scientist and that's most of the thing--time I'm spending my time doing.
Speaker 1: Alright. So you are, from what I understand just to set this up on some level is that you are studying the theory of everything basically?
Speaker 2: That's correct. So my--let me talk about my science thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It actually goes back to the time when I was a graduate student trying to get a Ph.D. So I passed my PC qualifying exam around '75 [1975] or so and so the next big hurdle is to write a Ph.D. thesis. In order to write a thesis you have to have an advisor and so I started trying to find someone who would serve as an advisor. I went to this one professor, his name was Kenneth Johnson and I walked in and I brought my transcript. I asked him if he was taking on students to supervise and he basically said well I wouldn't advise you to try to do this because this is a very difficult discipline and it's really hard to be successful and you should find something else to do. I left highly insulted and I made the assumption it was an ethnic matter. Some years later this same professor opened an amazing door for me to go to Harvard [University] so it had not been an ethic matter but at the time I was just flaming with anger inside. So I was trying to figure out how to get this thesis done and Jim Young was a professor at MIT and one of my other friends, a woman by the name of Karen Scott, suggested that I should talk to Jim about getting a Ph.D. thesis advisor. So I went to Jim and introduced myself because remember my attitude was this is that crazy guy that I remember gave that lecture. So you know I--got to be a little careful here. So I walked into his office and brought my little transcript and gave my little spiel and he said something like well you know I'm not taking on students right now but let me think about this. I think there's something that could be done. And then a couple of days later he called me back and said you know I'll take you on as a student. So Jim was the final important advisor and mentor that I had at MIT and he took me on as his Ph.D. graduate student. And he began to teach me the things that he knew about in elementary particle physics, the physics of electrons and things as tiny as electrons inside the nucleus, all that kind of mathematical stuff. And so I learned and began to write my first research papers under his supervision and then after about a year working with him I decided that I had to strike out in a different direction and because I saw what I was doing. I saw what a large number of young people and old people were doing and it's all essentially the same kind of stuff. And I thought you know how is a young guy who is going to try to become a professor, how is he going to distinguish himself doing work that professors who have been doing this for fifteen and twenty years are doing the same thing?  What kind of chance is this kid going to have to compete against those people?
Story_ID: 22229
Speaker 1: And so I decided that the more clever thing to do will be to figure out something that I was willing to bet my professional life on. So I made a big survey of all the topics that were going on in theoretical physics at the time. I had these big lists of paper. In the old days, computer printouts were these huge pieces of paper you could turn them over and write on. So I had huge lists with arrows pointing and connecting subjects and in this process I discovered this one subject that had been invented two years before I was a graduate student. And when I read it, it was like a door opening. I understood immediately that first of all it was, some of it was mathematics I had never seen before and I didn't know that such mathematics even existed. Not that I thought I knew all the mathematics but not--this was so bizarre that it was just mind blowing that this math exists which made it very clear to me that people make up mathematics. It's like writing new songs, creating new mathematics. And so I went back to Jim and said this is the work I want to work on, this area. And so he read some of the research papers that were out there and said well I don't know anything about this. Then he stopped and said, wait a minute, there's nobody in this department that knows anything about this stuff. How are you going to do this? And I said well I've begun to read the literature and I understand what they're talking about. And I'm pretty sure I can figure out how to write a thesis on this stuff. The reason I had been excited was I understood that this mathematics made the prediction of new forms of matter and energy that no one had ever thought about and I thought how lucky could you be to be alive when there's a form of mathematics like this? And there was no one else at MIT who understood this. I was in shock that the other people couldn't see the potential that was there. So Jim said I'll let you do this under one condition. You have got to give me a presentation once a week in my office of an hour's length telling me what you've been doing in that previous week and what progress you're making in getting this thesis done. And so he said I'll sign all the other paperwork and do all the other stuff. But he said I'm going to let--I'm going to trust you to actually manage this because the work you did under my supervision you--gave him confidence--he said you know gave me confidence that you can actually do this. And so I actually taught myself all this stuff because there was nobody at MIT who could teach me this subject. So two years later, 1977 I--
Speaker 2: Where were the experts?
Speaker 1: The experts were in Europe. The people who invented this subject were in, they were in Italy and Germany and Sweden but they weren't here. They were not in the U.S.
Speaker 2: Who were some of the people, the names (unclear)?
Speaker 1: The names that are associated with this are Bruno Zumino, Julius Wess, Lars Brink, Jean-Luc Jervey (ph.), a French physicist who made major contributions, Pierre Fiay(ph.), they weren't Americans. And yet like I said for me, it was like a, it's like being caught in the glare of a headlight. I said this stuff is so good that if I can get in there and learn how to do that, I'm going to be okay. I'm willing to bet my career on that and with complete dedication, passion, I totally got absorbed in it. And at that point I disconnected the other parts of my personality that you talk about people being drawn into stuff. Because it was clear to me that I could do this but it was going to take all that I had to do it. So I disconnected from lots of things during the period when I was producing my Ph.D. thesis.
Story_ID: 22230
Speaker 1: Alright, so here we go. This is big drama now. You're--
Speaker 2: Yeah. So 1977 is coming and I've written this thesis and I have to defend the thesis. So there are three professors including Jim Young who are on my defense committee. You have to go before your professors and explain to them what's done in the thesis and you know why it meets all the standards that a place like MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] would have for conferring a Ph.D. degree on a young candidate. And I--and normally thesis defenses can be very raucous because normally the faculty who are on the committee know far more than the young person who's before them and can ask all sorts of intricate and arcane questions. I sailed through my defense and in fact so much so that one of the professors on the committee, a gentleman by the name of Ernie Moniz [Ernest J. Moniz] who serves with me currently on P-cast, said to me it was the best thesis defense he had ever seen. And I remember walking away thinking, oh but I got you guys so good because I knew more about the subject than anybody in the room. So I often tell young people if you want to have a good time writing a thesis, find something none of your professors knows about and do it to the max.
Story_ID: 22231
Speaker 1: So what was your thesis? What was it?
Speaker 2: I--so the mathematics that had caught my eye in 1975 and '76 [1976] which spoke on the possibility of new forms of matter and energy are called--is called supersymmetry. So that my thesis at MIT in 1977 was the first thesis on the subject of super symmetry at MIT. It talks about things that are tinier than electrons. It talks about particles of light as well as things that we've never seen in the laboratory and it puts them into this beautiful mathematical narrative and let me talk about that for a moment. People in often--people often ask me what is it that theoretical physicists actually do and so I have a story and it goes as follows. What do authors of great literature do? Well they think of characters and then they endow the characters with attributes, they create scenarios for the characters to participate in and then they use that to tell a story. Well you see theoretical physicists do something rather similar. We look at the world around us and we create mathematical characters and endow them with properties and if we're physicists, these properties correspond to things that we see happening in the world around us, but it's mathematics. And one of the crazy things about mathematics is that mathematics lets you see things that you didn't know were there. An example of that was, so there's four equations that were written in the 1860s by a man named Maxwell. One of these equations said if you take a magnet and some batteries and a wire, you can create a little ball of electricity that flies outside the wires. No one had ever thought about that before. In 1880s, one of these balls was measured by a German physicist named Heinrich [Rudolf] Hertz. Shortly thereafter, a guy named Marconi [Guglielmo Marconi, Italian inventor] said you know if these balls are flying through space, I can use them to carry messages and that's how we got radio. So literally radio, television, all modern communication goes back to four equations where by writing the equations Maxwell was able to understand something about these mathematical characters that no one had ever dreamed possible. That's what we do. So one of the things about this process if you stop and think about it is, imagination is probably a very good thing here because just like authors need imagination to create these characters for the stories they tell, as a theoretical physicist, you actually need imagination to tell the stories. And so this whole part of my life which had been brought to a crucible by my mother's death and then sustained me through the period of bereavement even though I did not understand that's what I was going through the use of my imagination, it survived my teenage years in a way much stronger than most people who get through their teenage years. And in fact, has survived with me until this very day. There's a very strong element of imagination in my personality that impacted, in fact it's part of how I am able to create these mathematical characters and tell stories that no one else can see. So right now it's getting near the end of my career and my recitation. For the last ten or fifteen years or so I've been sort of like a Don Quixote. From the early part of my career there were some problems that were discovered in this field in which I work called supersymmetry which no one has solved till this very day.
Story_ID: 22232
Speaker 1: So from the early 70s [1970s] in this kind of mathematics that I do, there have been some problems that no one has been able to solve and now it's going on almost four years. So in the 90s [1990s], I decided that I was officially mature that I didn't care what other people were going to say. I was going to return to these unsolved problems. Many people think that I was crazy or whatever but I've been at it and it has in fact led to the most creative parts of my career. So we have found that for example buried in these equations that people can't solve, we have found computer code, not just any old kind of computer code but the kind of computer code that lets a browser work, totally stunning. We have found that these, that parts of these equations that people have not been able to solve lead to pictures that allow you to do algebra and calculus simply by playing with the pictures. You're playing with them but they correspond to mathematical operations. So we have found a way to visualize equations in such a way that we are more efficient at understanding the essence of equations than any methods that other people have ever invented. We currently are still in the process of struggling with these problems but we have found whole new pieces of mathematics that no one has ever used before and some of these results boggle the mind quite frankly. So let me go back to the computer codes.
Speaker 2: Well what--maybe, what are these questions anyway? Maybe you can outline--
Speaker 1: There are systems of equations that no one knows how to answer--
Speaker 2: Okay, alright.
Speaker 1: --find the answer to. It's like you know you write a simple equation like say the square of a number is equal to 4. What's the number? Well the answer is 2 because 2 x 2 equals 4. So there are problems like that, they're more complicated but they're essentially of that character that nobody knows how to answer. So we have found these new tools and this whole new point of view and I'm, in a few more years I'm pretty sure I'm going to be able to solve some of these problems because it takes years to actually develop these things. But the new viewpoint is absolutely critical to actually do that. But the fact that we find these pictures in equations stuns people. We call these pictures adinkras after a traditional word from West Africa. An adinkra is essentially a, an aphorism and that is a saying about a--it's a symbol that has a meaning behind it and so we thought that was an appropriate name to attach to these images of equations that we can generate and give very definite rules to and that's what I actually drew on the blackboard back here is one of them. The fact that we have found computer code of a certain type in the equations has prompted some people to ask the question, who put it, who put the code there and, to at least suggest that the answer is the creator of the universe. So for the first time in my life I've actually done research that some people say raises religious questions.
Speaker 2: So you're saying that this, these codes you've discovered could only have been placed there by someone (unclear)?
Speaker 1: I'm not saying that but I know people who have said that. And in fact if you go to YouTube right now, that's not a site that I endorse by any means because someone else put it together but there's a video running on YouTube that within the last month, last three months, half a million people have watched on this subject and it involves me. I mean some people have taken some images and words I've said and some of these people definitely believe that this is evidence of a creator. Other people argue that no it's not. But I've never done a piece of research that has prompted people to ask these kinds of questions.
Speaker 2: I don't--I wish I knew more about what it was so I could ask a good question. But I don't--
Speaker 1: Well I've written a popular level article for people who want to learn about this. It's called "Symbols of Power". It's actually available online so if you just type my name and the word adinkra, you could probably find the article.
Story_ID: 22233
Speaker 1: You've been asked a few times on NOVA to explain string theory.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And is that a good question for you?
Speaker 2: I can take another shot at it but it's going to be the same story I always tell and it goes as follows. If you were watching a game of billiards and you asked, can I understand how the balls bounce off the walls and off each other, the rules for that? And if you were the first person to answer that question with mathematics in a precise way, your name would be Isaac Newton because that's what he did. So all of physics, all of modern physics that we've been doing since the time of Newton is based--and including the building of calculus is all based on the idea that at some level the universe can be understood as the motion of little balls bouncing off of each other. But suppose there were something in nature for which that description just utterly fails. Suppose instead that there's some kind of something in nature where if you really want to try to understand it, you really should think of little strands of spaghetti as providing some kind of an explanation. Well if you shrink those strands of spaghetti down in size that's what string theory is all about.
Speaker 1: Okay. So--
Speaker 2: So what does it supposed to do? Well it's a piece of mathematics and it's supposed to for example explain things like why Einstein's equations were right. It's supposed to allow us to understand how atoms work and particles of light. It's supposed to allow us to understand gravity in a way that we have never understood before and if we are lucky, perhaps we are going to go get new technology out of that. That's what it's all about. It's just like the story with Maxwell writing his equations and now 150 years later we got these cell phone things. He couldn't have dreamed of that but it came out of the equations. It's about that kind of a story.
Speaker 1: Okay. From what I understand and correct me if I'm wrong what I think I get from watching some of the NOVA pieces and some of the--as a guy who is not even a mathematician is that the universe, there's no such thing as nothing.
Speaker 2: That seems to be right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That seems to be correct.
Speaker 1: You know so on a way macro level I'm thinking about, I'm thinking, we think there, you know we look around--I think that it's been common to think of the world as there's something and then there's nothing.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know and then somebody said well what about this air here? We can feel this and we--we don't see it but we--oh yeah, I mean yeah. So then, so as we delve into it further and further we discover that there, even at the atomical level (unclear)--
Speaker 2: There seems to be something in the universe even when you remove all of the particles, even when you remove all of the energy, we have mathematical evidence that there is something left.
Speaker 1: There's a fabric of the universe.
Speaker 2: And that's one of the ways this something is described.
Story_ID: 22234
Speaker 1: And what is the nature of this as you, as revealed by science today?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Or what's the theory of (unclear)?
Speaker 2: --we know that, well the best mathematical--well first of all the only descriptions that we have are mathematical and this is a very great difficulty because many people would like to share in this adventure and know more about it and because the very essence of our human knowledge of this is mathematical it means that we're at a disadvantage to explain to people what it is that we do. I often use this analogy that if--that you, that if there were a group of people who were color blind and you tried to explain to them what a bright red fire engine means you would encounter enormous difficulty. That's the difficulty a theoretical physicist has in trying to explain what it is that we do. Because it turns out that the very ideas that we think are not with specificity possible to express in terms of other forms of human language. And I know that people really don't get that one. They said how can it be that math, that mathematics is so different from all the language I know, all the music I know, the words, how can it be that mathematics is so different that it lets people think ideas that have no other way that they can be expressed? But as someone who works in this field I can tell you that's the truth.
Speaker 1: So as a scientist now we know scientists observe and measure and then theorize about the observations and measurements of the things that they observe. So what you're saying is and correct me if I'm wrong here for those who are probably thinking on my level here, that the fabric of the universe, there's no instrumentation to measure that or to--
Speaker 2: Not currently.
Speaker 1: --to observe it and measure it at the present time?
Speaker 2: Currently the answer is no. We have no instrumentation that we can measure this essence with.
Speaker 1: But a mathematician because he calculates and measures other things around this fabric knows that--
Speaker 2: And that's why--
Speaker 1: --there's something else that--
Speaker 2: And that's how we know these things.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Mathematics I--another of my favorite sayings is I like to say mathematics is an extrasensory perception organ because we have our five senses but mathematics is another way to sense what is there in the universe. That's how we scientists actually use mathematics as a sensory perception organ. So the first person to know the size of an atom was a guy named Albert Einstein. How did he do that, with a piece of mathematics. So we use mathematics as a way to see. This is something for example that Charles Darwin found striking about mathematics. He made, once made the statement that with mathematics it is as though one is endowed with a new sense and that's what I mean when I say we have an extrasensory perception organ. It really literally is that powerful for us.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 22235
Speaker 1: Where are we now in the process of determining what the fabric of the universe is? What is this that we're in?
Speaker 2: Sure. There is a story and I don't know if it's real or not about a black minister who was asked at some point during the post-civil rights era, has the country made progress? And the answer and the story goes something like we're not where we ought to be but thank god we're beyond where we used to be. And something like that applies to your question about where are we in the process of understanding the universe. We understand lots more as a species now than we did fifty years ago. In fact, more scientists are alive now than have ever been alive before. The human race is accumulating knowledge now in just a breathtaking rate that far exceeds any other point in the history of our species. On the other hand the more knowledge we gain the bigger the arena of our understanding the universe becomes. So we become acutely aware of how little we know learning more than we've ever known. And that's why that story about the preacher actually applies to us. Yeah, we know more now but we know how much more there is that we don't know now. And so we keep moving along trying to increase knowledge. And the whole goal of knowledge is to produce--of science is to produce knowledge for our species. I often tell people that you should think about the dinosaurs. They didn't have any scientists and they're not here now. And maybe if they had had some scientists they would be because that's really literally I think the ultimate reason to have science. Because nature can change and in fact we're probably in a period right now of climate change and global warming where nature is going to change and the only defense that we have in our technology and our technology comes from the vigor or our science. So I think that's actually the best reason why you want to have science.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 22236
Speaker 1: Now you know we live in a time, it seems like in recent years, science itself as being criticized as being not--I mean it's in an unscientific way by people who even make our textbooks.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And some have argued that global warming doesn't exist and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And it's a theory and not understanding what a theory is.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And it's, I mean it's--so do you have any comments about, I mean any thoughts about these, I mean where we are now? You just said that we have more scientists now than we've ever had before and yet we still have this kind of thinking.
Speaker 2: Sure. Well for me when I think about these issues, I've tried to learn as much of my species history as I can and there are some constants. We're probably not any dumber than we ever were before but we're not any smarter either as far as I can tell, not intrinsically. We know more. Knowledge is different from intelligence. Those are two different things. Yes, we have more knowledge now than we have ever had before but I don't see that there's any evidence that supports that the human species is more intelligent now than it has ever been before. I did--if someone can present that evidence to me, that would be a very great source of joy in my life. But I don't--from all I can see, that's just not a true statement so recognizing that there are some constants apparently in human behavior and in thinking patterns. I am distressed at only one level not because these things are out there because they've always been out there. But what distresses me is I believe I live in a time when our society as a whole is more willing to abandon the use of rational thought and logic. That's what distresses me. And I don't think it's a condition of our entire species, I think it's a condition of my society.
Speaker 1: American society, western--?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: American society or western society would you say is--?
Speaker 2: I don't think I know western society well enough to answer that question.
Speaker 1: But you know it's American society?
Speaker 2: I think I know American society well enough to answer that question and all the signs that I can see are that we are less willing to accept that rational and logical thought is of great value. In fact, belief--in fact that's one of the ways I see this is people ask us scientists, do you believe in evolution or do you believe in the big bang? And whenever I get that question from a non-scientist, I say that--I don't even know how to answer that question. What you should ask me is what evidence do I have for the things that I will profess to you? What is the evidence for the big bang? What is the evidence for global warming? What is the evidence? That's the key point. Belief and evidence are not the same thing and a big part of I think our--the problem I see in society is that people somehow think they're interchangeable.
Speaker 1: I think what can be inferred from what the first thing you said was that too we're experiencing I guess globally a bigger gap between what people who know, know and those who don't know.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, that is almost certainly true because even though it may not be a large number there are people who know far, far more now than the least informed than was the case a hundred years ago or two hundred years ago. That part I think is demonstrable.
Story_ID: 22237
Speaker 1: Now you grew up in a black community, partly.
Speaker 2: Partly.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you were partly in the military community.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And that's true we talked about that how that culture dynamic.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But partly in the black community too--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --at least enough to have experienced things like the black church and--
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: Now were you raised in a church environment?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My stepmother was a staunch follower of the African American--African Methodist Episcopal Church, the AME church. I sung in the choir as a teenager. I attended Sunday School every Sunday. I went to what was called Vacation Bible School. When I was fifteen or so I won the prize bible for being able to say more books in proper order in the bible than any other student in the summer school. So yes I was raised in the black church as a teenager, without a doubt.
Speaker 1: Did you, how--did you ever--I mean and yet you, well and yet you always have come back to say that you were encouraged by adults to learn more to, you know--but did you ever experience some contradiction in what was going on in church and what was--?
Speaker 2: No. No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And this is often a question I get especially from African Americans is how can it possibly be that you see no conflict between faith and science? And this is a question I've actually thought about for a very long time and one of the things I've learned in doing science is that often when you have a question the way to answer is to push it to sort of the most extreme point that you can by addressing it in a parable. And I've tried to do that with this question so let me try this on you. Suppose that there was a, some guy who came and told us tomorrow I am going to perform a miracle and I'll give you the time, the place and what have you. Because I think miracles are probably the most extreme manifestations of faith. I think people of faith would say yes, miracles are possible and that's why I want to go there. So let's see what happens. So let's say this guy says this to a group of scientists. I'm going to perform a miracle tomorrow at 2:15 p.m. in this room. What are the scientists going to do? Well most of them are going to laugh and say yeah right and they'll pay no attention. But let's assume that there are one or two scientists for whatever reason, maybe this guy is a friend of theirs, say okay well we're going to come and watch you perform this miracle. And we'll even do more than that. We'll bring our scientific instruments to measure it. So they're all set up and the guy says I'm going to perform the miracle right here so they had point all their microscopes and telescopes and all their observing instruments to this place where he says he's going to perform this miracle. And let's assume it happens. What happens next? The scientist will say do it again. Because you see science is not just the telling of a story and here the story will be a miracle was performed. Science is also the statement that you can prove that the story told actually occurs. That you can do this in all times and places, that you yourself had the means to prove that the story is as relayed to you by this body of belief called science. But you see this runs into a problem in this parable I've created because as I said the scientists are going to first say do it again. Because someone could say oh, you had some weird glitch in your observing equipment. Maybe there was a spike in the electrical field and that's what you--happened and that's what you thought you saw. Because the way that science works remember is everyone should be able to agree on what happens by their own means which means that a hundred years from now people have to be able to come into this same room and the same place and see this miracle occur because that's what science is all about. In other words, the fact that this miracle occurred would never be accepted as a piece of science because it's not reproducible and it does not provide a means for other people to test the idea. And that's one of the articles of what science is. If you think about the implications of this statement it means that in fact science has limits and this story that I've just told is about one of the limits of science, that science cannot accommodate a singular event which is not reproducible which may well mean that miracles can occur but science as a body of knowledge would never know about it. There is in fact a barrier that makes science blind to the possibility. And having understood that, I don't see a fight between science and religion because I know science is incapable of doing some things.
Story_ID: 22238
Speaker 1: In 1977, I graduated from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] with my Ph.D. in physics. At that point I went to Harvard University partly with the help of a professor Kenneth Johnson who I had spoke about earlier and became a junior fellow in the Harvard Societies of Fellows. I think I was the first African American physicist to ever become a junior fellow. I was there from 1977 to 1980 and then in 1980 I went to Cal-Tech [California Institute of Technology] to become a post-doctoral researcher in the research group headed by Professor Murray Gel-Mann and Professor Richard [Phillips] Feynman. And so I have my own personal Feynman stories interacting with him. He was just an amazing man on top of being a genius.
Speaker 2: Well tell us about him in a little more detail.
Speaker 1: I'll tell you one of them, one of my favorite Feynman stories. So Richard Feynman was ill with a serious illness during the time that I was a post-doc and so he was being treated at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles] Medical Center. And as any administrator of a blood bank will tell you, that's a great time to try to fill up your blood bank. So a call went out to the Cal-Tech community, come donate blood because Richard Feynman is having this operation in the not too distant future.  So lots of us jumped in cars and went over to UCLA in Wildwood and gave blood and I was one of those people. So Feynman had this surgery and a few months later he was feeling much better and he came back on campus and I encountered him in the hallway one day. And he said in that Brooklyn accent which I'll never be able to produce, Mr. Gates, I heard you were one of those people who gave blood at UCLA. And I said yes Professor Feynman I was. And then he kind of lifted his arm like this and put it down and said that explains something. And I'm like what could it explain. He says, every since the operation I feel like I've had a little bit more rhythm. And that was Richard Feynman and the two of us broke up laughing understanding that it was a joke. So this was the first time I've ever, I've actually ever told that story--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --so that it will be recorded for posterity. I have a few other such stories about my interactions with Feynman.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 22239
Speaker 1: After Cal-Tech [California Institute of Technology] --?
Speaker 2: So after Cal-Tech I went back to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] as an assistant professor of applied mathematics. So this is the period from 1982 to 1984. And I actually detested my time there and decided very shortly after I got there that I was going to leave.
Speaker 1: Now what was it? You're just too familiar with MIT or what was it?
Speaker 2: The honest truth is I, it was [a] disappointment. You see when I, the entire time I had been a student at MIT, I had been under a belief that MIT was very different from the other Ivy League institutions at the point that ethnicity didn't matter as much in terms of the value attached to the ability of a single human mind to engage a problem successfully. When I went back on faculty I saw lots of evidence that that just wasn't true. And so I was disappointed and decided I did not want to be part of what I thought of as a charade. So I decided to leave a few weeks after I got there but it wasn't until 1984 when I was able to get a position--a professor here at the University of Maryland had met me in Italy which is where I used to spend my summers at the International Center for Theoretical Physics that was created by a gentlemen by the name of Abdus Salam who was one of the greatest mentors in my life. And so I got this tenure offer to come to Maryland and I came in 1984. People at the time asked me what was it like and I said like dying and going to heaven and I've had little reason to change that opinion since then. For two years I was--I took a leave of absence from Maryland because it had always been my dream to make a contribution to a historically black college and so from 9--the period of 1991 to 1993 I was the chair of the physics department at Howard University. And one of the things that I did there that I was responsible for working with some other people was that we got the largest research grant ever given to historically black colleges from the Department of Energy for a project that we developed there. So I'm very proud of my time at Howard but in 1993, I decided to come back to University of Maryland.
Story_ID: 22240
Speaker 1: Just tell us a little bit more about Abdus Salam.
Speaker 2: Ah, Abdus Salam. So Abdus Salam in some ways started the process that led to my leaving MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology]. Abdus Salam was a Pakistani physicist. He's the only Pakistani physicist ever to be awarded the Nobel Prize and he was someone from a third world country who understood that for people in third world countries to be able to do the kind of work that he did, there had to be infra--organizational infrastructure that would allow it and it didn't exist. So he created his organization called The International Center for Theoretical Physics. ICTP is the acronym. And so by the late 80s [1980s], I was a regular summer resident at the ICTP. He had met me around 1977 or 1978 and he had understood something about me that I myself had not understood and that was that it was good for me as a person of the African Diaspora to see people from all over the world in all of earth's diverse ethnicities doing physics at the highest level that it could be done and so he made sure that I had a standing invitation to come to the center every summer and as a consequence I was there continuously from like 1980 through '85 [1985], every summer. During that time sometimes we would have conversations. He was a very formal gentleman, very British because that was his educational background but very warm in the reserve way that such people can be. And he made me understand very clearly that he wanted to be a person who would be helpful in my journey and that he was rooting for my success. And you know it's not everybody who gets a Nobel Laureate to be rooting for their success. So it was just a fabulous thing to discover.
Story_ID: 22241
Speaker 1: Now here at University of Maryland, you are now the John Toll Professor of Physics--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: This is an endowed chair.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: So yes, I am the John S. Toll Professor of Physics. Johnny Toll was still alive when I assumed the chair. In fact, Johnny Toll is one of the great mentors in my life too. I used to tell people when I grow up, I want to become Johnny Toll. Johnny Toll is the creator of the Modern University of Maryland System. He is the creator of this campus. He also created, he was the person most responsible for the initial creation of the State University of New York. Johnny Toll is the individual who grew institutions to greater stature than they were before he came to them and he was an amazing man, and as I said one of my true heroes in life. So I was always extremely proud of the fact that he personally had a hand in my being named the John S. Toll Professor of Physics.
Speaker 1: So he had a hand in building the State University System in New York too?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was--Stony Brook.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not the entire--Stony Brook, the Stony Brook campus, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. Stony Brook, okay. All right well thank you for that. That's good. I always, I think it's always good for us to know who things are named for. And--
Speaker 2: Yeah and Johnny, just utterly fantastic man. In the early 80s [1980s], I'm sorry, middle 80s [1980s] after I had come here middle to late 80s [1980s], proper description, after I had come here, my wife was in med school in New Orleans [Louisiana] so I was still acting like a graduate student. I would show up in the department at all kinds of odd hours late at night and be working and I noticed this really old guy who would be here too. And I'm like who is this guy? And eventually I met him and it was Johnny Toll.
Speaker 1: Okay. Tell us about your teaching here at the University of Maryland and some of your students and some of the products you're involved in.
Speaker 2: Sure. So I have been a professor here at the University of Maryland for twenty eight years now. I have graduated the last time I looked, nineteen Ph.D. students. Over the course of my career, I probably taught around, between three and five thousand students. I became a professor because I fell in love with teaching. It was only later that I found I had the ability to do this really strange mathematical creative work that is called research. My--the first Ph.D. thesis I supervised was when I was at Cal-Tech [California Institute of Technology] before I came here to College Park and I supervised a thesis for a young man named Barton Zweibach and Barton is a professor at MIT now. I have a, some others I, as I said I have supervised around 19 Ph.D.s at this point in my career. One of them is actually here visiting right now, a young man by the name of William Lynch who was a student of mine back at the, I guess in the early 2000 period and has been a faculty member abroad and come, has come here, returned for a year. I work with undergraduate students. I've written research papers and referee journals with undergraduates and even high school students. One of my students with whom I did this is a young man by the name of Akeem Morrison. He's currently an undergraduate at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology]. He should be in his, probably his junior or senior year this year. When he was a freshman he came in with a research, published research paper and I was his co-author. Not many people get to walk into MIT saying I have published a scientific paper in some of the most esteemed journals there are. Akeem could say that. So teaching has always been a great source of joy for me.

Speaker 1: What are your thoughts about the STEM [science, technology, engineering and mathematics] education in the U.S. today and the kind of students we're getting on the college campuses?
Speaker 2: Sure. So STEM education, that is science, technology, engineering and mathematics has been a large part of my life at the policy level for the last three years. In 2009, within a two week period I received an appointment to the Maryland State Board of Education because of our governor's desire to see STEM education as a high priority for the State Board of Education. And I was also appointed to the U.S. President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, called PCAST for short. And my role there has not exclusively, but a large part of my time in PCAST has been devoted to the issue of STEM education for the entire nation. Two years ago I had two young people who were seniors in high school so we had seen what was going on in high school through the lens of being parents. And so a large part of my intellectual energy over the course of the last three years has been first learning something about how STEM education works in the United States and then looking at our system in comparison to what's going on in the rest of the world, the particular--the countries that are going to be our major economic competitors in the coming decade. Most Americans seem not to understand that this country though the wealthiest country in the world right now, by 2050, we are not going to be the wealthiest country in the world. In fact, it's going to happen essentially no matter what we do it's going to be, we're going to be either 2 or 3 but we're not going to be No. 1. And part of the dynamic that's going to change this positioning of wealth has to do with the kind of innovation that occurs in corporate America around STEM subjects. So you know everybody loves their iPhone and their iPad and YouTube but all of that rests on the basis of science, engineering, mathematics and technology. And yet in our country last year more students got degrees in the performing arts than got engineering degrees. America, as a country we don't know these things. In fact I was on a college campus about a year ago and I made this comment during a speech and afterwards a professor came up to me and said you know (unclear) there's one thing about your speech that puzzles me. He said, you said it's a bad thing for more people to get degrees in performing arts than to get degrees in engineering. He said I don't understand why that's true. And if a professor can come up to me and say that, to me that's a sign of real trouble in our society. And the reason why it's a problem is because wealth gets created out of engineering. Wealth doesn't get created out of performing arts. What you do in a performing arts is you move wealth around so I become a famous actor, I get wealthy, but that money came from someone else. It's not new wealth in the society. When someone creates something like an iPad that's a new form of wealth. Wealth comes from science. That's something that Abdus Salam was the first person to tell me which I had not even understood. In fact, he called physics the wealth making science and he's exactly right.
Story_ID: 22243
Speaker 1: And so my concerns about my nature, my--the nature of my country's future is that we have a large disconnect in our population who somehow think that a college degree in music and drama and in visual arts is equivalent to a college degree in electrical engineering, in computer science, in physics or mathematics. These are not equivalent degrees because of what they represent in terms of the possibilities of creating wealth for the society, new wealth for the society.
Speaker 2: Okay. Do you--there seems to be an increasing dialogue about eliminating liberal arts in schools. Would you be in favor of--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --cutting down on--?
Speaker 1: No, absolutely not and this is a debate that I often hear people say well gee, are you saying that we don't need history, we don't need literature, we don't need art? And my answer to that is absolutely not because you see those are the things I think that most sharply define us as human beings. I think those things define us far more than our science and technology. Those are deep expressions of what the word humanity means. So would I want to cut off my arm in order to see better because that's what the equivalent is here? I don't think I would do that.
Speaker 2: Okay. So, but would you agree then that this--our country is not really living up to its potential in terms of educating enough people in engineering and math and science and STEM--?
Speaker 1: Not by all kinds of indicators that one can find. For example, if you ask the question what country has the largest percentage of educated people? For most of the last of the fifty years, that was the United States. It's not true now. We're like No. 3 right now. Three is not so bad you know. But the thing that's really interesting about the distribution of education, if you look at the youngest generation of workers in our population, they actually have less education than the generations in front of them. It means that for the first time in over a hundred years, we have a work force of new workers that's less well educated on average than the workers that are going to retire. That hasn't happened in over a hundred years in this country.
Story_ID: 22244
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Well first of all the African American community in this country, I like to say that we as a community are avatars of what's going to happen to the country as a whole. Examples: if you look at the African American community, when I was at--when I was the chairman of the physics department at Howard, my best students were young women and this was the first time in my life I experienced that, that when I walked into a physics class and asked who were my top students, they were young women. I think it was last year for the country as a whole marked the first year that more young women were in college than young men. You could see that trend in the African American community ten years earlier. And if you in fact look at lots of indicators you can see the future for the entire society by asking what's happening with the African American community. So the things that concern me are large and legion. We as a community I think have lost some things that I--that were I think obvious to the community in the early 70s [1970s]. For example, I came through an African American community when being the valedictorian of my class was considered an admirable thing by other black students. I never got ribbed for being the smart kid. I never got ribbed for turning in my homework on time. And yet now-a-days I hear so many stories that it's called acting white if you do these things. Unless we can change this narrative--and no one can do this for us, unless we can change this narrative as a community, there is going to be increasing economic disenfranchisement of the African American community because we are going to be farther and farther disconnected from the wealth making in society. And it's not just us. This is going to happen to other folks too but we're the leading edge of that process. So this is the big one for me is for the community to understand that the things that we enunciate as our values actually matter and that these had better be aligned with the health and welfare of the community in the largest sense as we look at the decades ahead of us. Our political leadership is fragmented in many ways. You know I'm here in Washington, D.C. so we see you know all kinds of evidence that our political leaders in the African American community are not acting in the best interest in the community as a whole. I personally am worried about changes in the nuclear family of the African American community. The thing that I know for a fact is that my success is grounded in the love that I felt for--from both of my parents and that each of those parents did slightly different things for me that without which I don't see how I could have gotten to the level of success that I have now. And because of that personal experience as well as several hundred thousand years of the human experience, it suggests the family structure matters. We're now in the process of actually testing that with some of the trends that are going on in the African American community and that are now in fact breaking out to the larger society. I worry about those things.

Speaker 1: Sir, tell us something about your family. Now you have children right and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and you're married.
Speaker 2: I've got children.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have a son and a daughter. My daughter's name is Delilah Elizabeth Abney Gates. My son is named Sylvester James Gates, III. He has that name however I make sure he understands that he doesn't have that name named after me, he's named after my dad. And I try to make sure he understands that distinction very well that my father was really someone special and that that's the name he carries. And so as he tries to figure out what he's going to do in life that's the name that will be associated with what he does given what my father did for his family. My daughter and son are twins. They are now entering their second year of college here at the University of Maryland, College Park. My son is a biology major, my daughter is a double-major in math and physics which when she told me she was going to do that I thought oh my, why would she do that? Then of course I thought wait a minute, that's what I did as a graduate. My wife is a pediatrician. She has managed a pediatric practice now for twenty one years. She's also just assumed the position of deputy health officer medical for Charles County which is where her practice is located. She's always been interested in public medicine. And so our household and the household in which my children been raised is one that reminds me a little bit about the Jamaican family that was running gag line on the In Living Color comedy series where the question was, how many jobs do you have? That's kind of our household is how many jobs do you have as a parent? I effectively have four. My wife has at least four, maybe five. And so we've tried to: a) make sure the children understand that we absolutely love them because like I said that's the most important thing that parents can do; but b) that that love means that they should be on a platform to give to the needs of the world in the way their parents have tried to do.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now did your dad and your mother get a chance to see you become a Ph.D. in physics?
Speaker 2: My dad did. My mother as I said, my biological mother died when I was 11 so she never had that opportunity.
Speaker 1: Did your stepmother see it?
Speaker 2: My stepmother did not also. She did not come--well she saw it in the sense that yes she saw the degree but she didn't get a chance to come to the graduation ceremony and dad did. When I got my Bachelor's degrees I didn't go to the graduation ceremony. And it was very simple because I always regarded those things as for the parents, not for the person getting the degree. And since neither of my parents was able to come out when I got my Bachelor's degree I said there was no point to going and so I skipped it. Very happily so without a second thought. When I got my Ph.D. degree, my dad said I'm coming. So I said well I guess that means I got to go cause I can't have my name called and not be there on stage.
Story_ID: 22246
Speaker 1: My dad [Sylvester James Gates, Sr.] during the last twenty years of his life was one of my absolute best friends. It shocked me in my forties when I realized that dad was a good friend of mine because as a child he had been such a strict disciplinarian I couldn't imagine this guy would be a friend. But yet when I was an adult and well on the path he was a friend, two stories about that. In my early twenties I went out to Cal-Tech [California Institute of Technology] for the first time and I hadn't quite calculated my money correctly and so I was running short and so I gave dad a call. I said dad, can you loan me some money until I get back to Boston [Massachusetts]. He said no, absolutely not. He said you figured out how to get out there, you'll figure out how to get back. And I was stunned. I'm like oh my god I'm going to starve to death. Dad's not going to help me. But of course he was right. I figured out how to do it. Twenty years later we were having a conversation and I said dad you know about a couple of years ago I was having some real tough financial times and I wasn't sure I was going to be able to make my mortgage. And I said but we, you know everything worked out. And he stunned me by saying well why didn't you call me? I said what are you talking about? I said when I was in my twenties and I asked for a couple of hundred dollars, you just said no. And now we're talking about a couple of thousand and you said why didn't I call you? He said yeah. And I understood that from his perspective, the first one was about continuing my education. And therefore if I had made that second call he would have absolutely said yes. So yeah that's the kind of friend I had in my father and unlike a lot of people, it's often the case with males, you hear people say things like well the euphemism is, I never sang for my dad. That is I never got a chance to stand in front of my father and show my best stuff. I had that chance on many occasions, including one literally, not singing but doing the physics I did. I gave a talk at the University of Florida once and he at the time this was in Gainesville so he was living in Orlando and he knew I was coming to give this physics presentation. He knew he wouldn't understand anything in it but he said can I come? I said dad why do you want to come to this thing? It's not going to be accessible. He said that's okay, I just want to come. So I called up the organizer and said you know my dad wants to come to the seminar. Is it okay if he sits in the back of the room? They said sure. Sure he can come. So he came to the back of the room. I give this technical talk full of mathematics that it's like no one, you know like certainly no ordinary human being would understand a single word I said. And he just sat in the back of the room and smiled. So you see I literally had a chance to sing in front of my dad because he got a chance to see what all his efforts had created. Before he died one of the things he said to me which I will always treasure is, son, you have exceeded every expectation I ever had of you. That was my dad.
Story_ID: 22247
Speaker 1: When you look back over everything you've done till this point, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: As a teacher it has always been in the forefront of my mind that I ought to be a doorway through which my students can walk into their future. And so the thing that I think I'm most proud of is the young people that I have had a chance to educate or at least to have a hand in educating. By far, I think that's the thing I take the greatest source of joy in. Secondarily to that is what I've been able to do as a theoretical physicist because I have literally created pieces of mathematical construction to describe nature that nobody in the world could do except for me. And so I have an enormous sense of satisfaction that the dream I had as a young person because most of us who are theoretical physicists, I think when we dream, as young people we dream that we're going to be able to create a piece of magical mathematics that is an accurate description of something in the world cause I think that's what theoretical physicists want to do. And here at the end of my career it looks like I may well have done this thing that I dreamed about as a young eighteen or nineteen year old and so I have enormous satisfaction in that. And one thing that people need to understand is that this satisfaction has nothing to do with whether I get recognized for this work or not because you see I know that I did it and that's the thing that's the secret.
Story_ID: 22248
Speaker 1: If you look back at your life again, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: There are enormous numbers of things that I would do differently, including not have a first marriage that failed. I tell people that there is no way in the world that I would voluntarily choose to become young again unless I knew everything that I know right now because it's simply not worth it. I made all kinds of bad choices as a young person, just like everybody else. That's--I always say life would be so great if it just came with an owner's manual but it didn't.
Speaker 1: Well said. I agree with that.
Story_ID: 22249
Speaker 1: Now is there anything I have not asked you about that we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Yes. There's one thing that I would say. I told you the story about how this four year old young child crawled up in the cockpit of a flying boxcar and peered down at the landscape which looked like a quilt passing below him and just being absorbed in the wonder of that. I fell in love with airplanes from that experience. In 2006 I think it was, I made my first visit to Australia and I took my family and we were in Perth, Australia and part of the invitation was because one of the students that I had taught twenty years earlier is currently the head of the physics department at the University of Western Australia so the invitation was at his behest. And so the family was there for two weeks, I was there for three and a half weeks. So I had to bid them adieu and on the day after they went back, my former student, Ian, said I'm going flying on Sunday, would you like to come? And I said sure. Now he's had a pilot's license for twenty, twenty five years and he's a member of a flying club in Perth. And on the way to the airport I said "Ian, can I fly the plane?" And he said, "have you ever flown a plane before?" I said "no". He says, "what do you know about flying a plane?" So I began to tell him all those things I learned about, from books when I was a child and when we got to the airport the plane that he had rented time on is an open cockpit bi-wing World War I, or just after World War I era trainer. It's called a Tiger Moth. I have a picture of that. Maybe I should put that, I should have put that perhaps in the things that I put on your reel. And so at--we took off on a glorious day and at 1500 feet in the air over Perth, Australia, over Downtown Perth, I got a chance to take the stick and rudder and I flew the plane for half an hour and we flew out over the ocean, flew back in over land, headed back towards the landing field and I gave the stick and rudder back to him just before we landed. And so this dream that I had nurtured for almost fifty years of being able to fly a plane was one of the glorious days in my life.
Story_ID: 22250
Speaker 1: Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As someone with all the imperfections that humans come with and are, as someone who tried to do their best to render service. That's really what I'd like to have people remember. Whether it was service and trying to create pieces of mathematics for a deeper understanding of nature, service to my children as a parent and trying to put the background in place for them to have abundant lives, service to my nation and advising a president and State Department of Education here, service in teaching thousands of students and trying to be that doorway that I talked about. That's really--I guess that would do it for me.
Story_ID: 22251
Speaker 1: On the left hand side of this picture is a--appears an image of my father. It's taken some time in the period of 1960 to '62 [1962] when we were all living at Fort Bliss, Texas and he was still in the U.S. Army. On the right hand side of this picture is a picture of my mother. It is in fact about twenty years older and comes from the period around 1941 to '43 [1943] and it's the picture that my mother gave to my father. It was actually a small snapshot that sat in his breast pocket the entire 13 months he was in Europe during the Second World War.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my mother and father at a dance where they're greeting the Commanding General of the base, General Snodgrass was his name at Fort Bliss. His wife in fact was a teacher and she taught me in fourth grade. This is a picture of a poster from a movie called 'Spaceways'. The movie starred Howard Duff and Eva Bartok and it was the first inkling in my life of why I would become a scientist some twenty some odd years later.
Speaker 1: These are pictures of four books which my father gave to me when I was in third grade. They are authored by a gentleman named Willie Ley who wrote children's books about space travel and these are the books that began to fire my imagination about rockets and science and space travel and they were constant companions when I was like I said second and third grade.
Speaker 2: That's my dad at Fort Bliss, Texas. He was an instructor for a while on armored personnel vehicles and here he is holding the stick with a young trainee on the top of the vehicle learning how to operate it. This is in fact an anti-aircraft vehicle.
Speaker 1: That's a picture of our entire family around 1961. In the picture standing tall to the left is my father, then to the right is my mother. And the on the lower level coming from left to right you'll find me to the far right, my youngest brother William who is now deceased standing directly in front of my father. Next to William moving to the right is my sister Sylvia and finally to the far, to the farthest on the right away from me is my brother Ronald.
Speaker 2: That's a picture of me at eight years old in the center of this image and so the lower part of the image you can see a guy holding up a transparency. That's me when I was in my forties.
Speaker 1: That's a picture of me on the day that I received my Ph.D. degree, walking across the stage to get it.
Speaker 2: That's a picture on the far right hand side of me back around 1983, this is the longest I've ever worn my hair and as you can see this is back in the disco days. In the center of this picture is my wife Diana and to the far opposite from me is a friend of mine who is a chemist by the name of Joe Francisco.
Speaker 1: This is a, actually a manipulated image of me that was created around the topic of my doing string theory. It shows an imaginary piece of the mathematic, me holding an imaginary piece of the mathematics. And I'm highlighting in the background by equations of which I am the inventor.
Speaker 2: This is an occasion of speaking at the University of Oregon before an audience of about 2,500 people during the convocation. This was, it happened around 2006.
Speaker 1: This is not such a good shot but it's from a BBC documentary I did in January of 2012.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my wife and I on the day that I was sworn in by the Governor of Maryland for, to begin my service as a member of the Maryland State Board of Education.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of me around 1986, when I first came to the University of Maryland to become a faculty member.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of me on my honeymoon in 1984.
Speaker 1: This picture is actually taken in front of the house of a very famous scientist by the name of Lagrange.
Speaker 2: This is me sort of cutting up in the year 2011 at a research center in Canada called the Perimeter Institute.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of me on my grad--in my graduation regalia from high school.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of me around 1984 or 5 but this particular picture first appeared on the web at a website where they recounted how I almost became an astronaut.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of me that we saw earlier in the center of an image. I was eight years old. Look at those ears.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of me when I was at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] was a faculty member. This is just before a commencement ceremony. I am on the left hand--the right hand side of the picture and then to my right in the picture which is left view is a friend of mine by the name of James Hubbard [also a HistoryMaker] who was also an assistant professor while I was there; just a picture of me cutting up around 19--, around 2003.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of me, this is how I looked when I was a post-doc at Cal-Tech [California Institute of Technology] in the period of 1980 to 1982.
Speaker 2: And this is, this blurry picture is a picture that was taken on my honeymoon where my wife and I spent two and a half months in Europe hitting lots and lots of cities and one of the places we saw was Paris [France].
Speaker 1: And this is a picture that was taken in 2006 where I simply sat for, I was sitting for a video documentary and this was a still that was taken.
Speaker 2: And this is a picture of me that was taken in front of MIT for a science documentary that was produced by the BBC.
Speaker 1: And this is a picture of--from that series called 'The Hunt for the Higgs' where I was giving commentary on the topic of super symmetry.
Speaker 2: This picture shows me to the left hand side of the center where you will see President [Barack] Obama. Immediately to the left of President Obama in the picture is the presidential science advisor, Dr. John [Paul] Holdren.
Speaker 1: And this is simply the PCAST group, the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. Standing to my left in the picture is Dr. Shirley Jackson who taught me physics in the summer of 1969 and to the far right in this image is Professor Ernie Moniz who was on my Ph.D. thesis defense committee in 1977.
Speaker 2: And this is me and my family. This picture was taken during the last holiday period. I'm obviously the tallest person in the picture. Standing to my right is my wife Diana. We've been married now for twenty-eight years. To her right is my son Sylvester James Gates, III and to my right in the picture--I'm sorry. To the left of my wife as viewed is my son. To the right of the picture is, the far right is my daughter Delilah and that's the last one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
