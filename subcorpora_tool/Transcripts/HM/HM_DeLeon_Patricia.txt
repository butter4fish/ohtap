Story_ID: 31200
Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna ask about your family history--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side.  But we're gonna ask separate so we can keep them, you know, straight.
Speaker 2: Straight, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Mother's name is Kathleen Louise Monica Martin.  So Louise Martin, she went, she went by Louise Martin, my, which is my husband--our father, my father's name.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you spell that for us, Katherine.
Speaker 2: Well, why don't you put Louise, L-O-U-I-S-E, Louise Martin.  That's what she's really known generally of.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was her maiden name?
Speaker 2: Green.
Speaker 1: Green, okay.  And what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, very little--
Speaker 1: --and are there any stories about what they--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --because her mother died at birth.  She was one of a twin.  And so she didn't know her mother, and so there is not a lot there.  Her father was Ira Green, and there's not a lot of information there.  So she, she was born in Saint Ann's Bay [Jamaica], in the Parish of Saint Ann.  And as a young woman, she moved to Port Maria [Jamaica], and--with a family.  And from that family, she got married and so she--there's really not a lot of history, I guess because her mother died at birth, and her father--I don't know if her father remarried or what.  But she, she just didn't have a whole lot of--we didn't hear a lot of stories (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, St. Ann's Bay, that's the birth place of Marcus Garvey [Jamaican political leader, publisher, journalist, entrepreneur, and orator; proponent of Black nationalism and Pan-Africanism movements; founder of the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA-ACL)]?
Speaker 2: Actually, she is related to Marcus Garvey.
Speaker 1: Is she?
Speaker 2: Yes, she's related to Marcus Garvey.
Speaker 1: Well, that's quite a story.
Speaker 2: Yeah, grand--Ethel, who is her mother, is related to--we have the, was a Garvey, I think, before--I'm not, you know, I think--she definitely was related to Garvey through her mother's die, and so because her mother died in--she was one of a twin, and I think, and the other twin died, and the mother died, and she was the one of the three who survived.  And so that's why we have so little, but she was related to Marcus Garvey.
Speaker 1: Okay, her name was Ethel?
Speaker 2: Ethel, um-hum.
Speaker 1: And her last name was--wasn't Garvey?
Speaker 2: It was Green.
Speaker 1: It wasn't Garvey?
Speaker 2: I think she was--the Garvey, I can't say she was, for sure, if she was a Garvey herself, but I know she was related, she was the one who was related to Marcus Garvey.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  But there are no stories passed down on that side of the family about what--
Speaker 2: Absolutely no stories.
Speaker 1: --they were doing?  Well, I mean stories, I mean what they were doing for a living, you know, and what were they, you know--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, right.
Speaker 1: --that kind of thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, in most of the--even my, my one grandmother that I know with my father's mother, they were a homemakers.  I mean she was a homemaker.  My, my grand, my father's father was a wheelwright, a wheelwright.  They make wheels--
Speaker 1: Yeah, for wagons and--
Speaker 2: --for cars, right, that's right.  That's the only thing I can remember of, in terms of what they did in terms of occupation.
Speaker 1: Now, what they used to--what I read about Garvey's [Marcus Garvey] family is that they were, he was descended from Maroons, (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That's, Maroon, yeah, we aren't too far from Maroons.  In fact, granny--sorry, my, my other, my father's mother, she says she's Maroon.  She has the hair like she is descended from Maroon.  In fact, my sister has been back to Maroon town, Maroon Bay to dig up things on, on our parents because they were Maroons.
Speaker 1: That's on your father's side, correct?
Speaker 2: That's also, she--granny was--that's on my father's side.  That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was the one grandmother that I knew, right.  So she had the, the Maroon hair, you know, whatever.
Speaker 1: Dreadlocks or--
Speaker 2: Well, no, it's kind of a soft--it's not dreadlocks because it, those women they didn't--but the kind of features, she's, you know.  So it led one of my sisters to go to Maroon Town and spend two weeks there trying to find out things about them, you know, from, and Maroon Town is close by.  It's between St. Ann and Trelawny, in that area, I think.  I've never been there myself, but my sister has.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.
Story_ID: 31201
Speaker 1: Now, did your mother [Louise Green Martin] have a chance to go to school in--
Speaker 2: You know, it's amazing, she--I don't think she went to--in those days, you, after fifteen [years] you, it's called you're out school.  (Laughter) In Jamaica, you're out of school at fifteen.  And I don't think she went, no, she didn't.  She went--that was at the age that she left, she left St. Ann's Bay and went to work with, to kind of, I think it must be work-live with this family in St. Ann's.  So she never got an education beyond high school.  And high school meant beyond fifteen because that's when they were out of school in those days, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  All right, so she went to St.--
Speaker 2: She left St. Ma--St. Ann's where she was born, where the Garvey people were there and was taken by this family who lived in Port Maria, in St. Mary.  And they were Catholics.  They were raised--she went to Catholic Church with them, and she, and from there, she got married.
Story_ID: 31202
Speaker 1: Let's go to your father's side of the family.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Leonard Percival Martin, P-E-R-C-I-V-A-L, Percival, and Leonard is the first name.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: It's--you didn't ask my mom's date of birth, did you? (Laughter) No.
Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't?  Yeah, what is it?  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was born July 18, 1920.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my dad was born July 24, 1918.
Speaker 1: Everybody's born in July.  (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: So I, yeah, we have a--and I have one other sibling born in July, one sibling.  And so we have a lot of July birthdays.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So is there a story behind your father's name?  He's got--
Speaker 2: Leonard Percival, no, I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And where was your father born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Sand--St. Mary [Jamaica], a little town called Sandside.
Speaker 1: S-A-N-D?
Speaker 2: S-A-N-D, Sandside, S-I-D-E, one word.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay, now, what--
Speaker 2: It's still Port Maria, but not--
Speaker 1: So what can you tell us about your father's side?  How far back can you trace that side and what are the stories?
Speaker 2: Well, his mother, granny, she lived until she was, I think it was ninety-seven [years old] or ninety-nine, not sure.  And I know her very well, I mean she, you know, we'd come to her home every Sunday for dinner (unclear) when we were growing up.  She never worked.  She was (unclear)--she never worked, she stayed home.  She had thirteen children and ten of them died and only three survived.  In those days, there was a lot of infant mortality, obviously.  And they died, a lot of them died young, but only three survived, which was my father and his two sisters, one younger and one older.  Her husband was William Martin, and he was the wheelwright.  And I don't think he was a very--it's interesting.  You know, I--they never spoke a lot about him while we were growing up, until recently I heard that he, he just never--he wasn't a very good (laughter) husband.  He never treated Granny very well.  And, but I just--just within the last couple of years, my father mentioned that.  So he was, he wasn't--I don't think he was the greatest provider, but he died, he fell off a horse, and the horse kicked him in his stomach.  And he died.  And so he died as a middle-aged man, and there really is not a lot of history that was related to us about him, until recently, I figured that he didn't treat Granny as well as he should have (laughter).  And that's probably why we hadn't heard anything about him (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But we know Granny was a good part of our life, you know, because she lived so long, and she, well, you know, she came to, cooked Sunday dinner, and we lived in the same town growing up as children.  So we knew her, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, your Granny now, she's related to the Maroons, you're saying?
Speaker 2: Right, she's a, she was Sarah, Sarah Martin.  Right, and she's the one who said she was related--and that was the reason that my sister went to the Maroon town to do some, you know, some archival work or look the, you know--
Speaker 1: So it's actually a place called Maroon Town?
Speaker 2: Yes, it's called Maroon Town, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and it's near St. Ann's Bay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, near St. Ann's, Trelawny, yeah, in St. Ann, probably close to Trelawny, but it's near St. Ann's, yeah, Maroon Town, yeah.
Speaker 1: How do you spell Trelawny?
Speaker 2: T-R-E-L-A-W-N-Y, Tre, T-R-E, Lawany, L-O--L-A-W-N-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 31203
Speaker 1: So what did they do for a living?  What did your father [Leonard Percival Martin] and his family do?
Speaker 2: Oh, my father, my father was a really successful businessman.  He, I think, now I can understand why he--he started his life as a trade, it was, went to cabinetmaker, as a trade.  And then he built a builder of cabinet, you know, (unclear).  Then he opened a business so he would have a furniture establishment.  He would make furniture, manufacture furniture.  Then he did building blocks.  Then he did cement.  He did hardware.  He opened one of the first furniture store in the town of Port Maria [Jamaica].  He was in a way a pioneer.  And I think that probably the reason that--I'm thinking just in retrospect that he really tried to excel to do for his family because I think his father wasn't a good--but he, but I'm just through my--I'm just saying that.  I think that the reason, looking back, I think that he, he was inspired by his father (laughter), his father wasn't such a, you know, but he was a very--he has been a pioneer in the small town of Port Maria.  He's got, like a, you know, awards from the City Municipal, you know, he, as for--as a businessman, hiring people and--so he's, I would say that he spent the greater part of his life as a successful businessman in a small town.  He bought a funeral home.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, the funeral home.  Now, that's something that--
Speaker 2: You saw that?
Speaker 1: I saw it in the outline, yeah, the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: The funeral home, yeah.  He's, he was the first one to open a funeral home there.  He was, he was kind of--he's really a thinker, you know, meaning a lot of the things he didn't--and he got competed out, but he, he was the first one--I remember (laughter) he used to have these pick-up trucks, van, and we used to drive in the back.  And he, on this van, he had, you know, written "Martin Establish--Martin Furniture Establishment", and we would sit in the back of the truck.  And they said, "You are the table, you are the chair", (laughter) to our sisters, you know, we'd sit in the back of the van.  In those days, you know, but he--it, he did a lot of things, the first person in the little town.  And I think he, he strived pretty well.  You know, as I said, he had a restaurant, he had grocery store, restaurant, furniture store, hardware store, funeral home, real estate, anything that you can think of, he did a lot-- he, he--and fairly, you know, made buildings, sold them, made--he was, he built our house.  It was the first stone log (unclear) house on the street in which we lived.  And, you know, so he, I don't know where he--he had this kind of thing that he really (laughter), free, kind of free thinker too, I mean because I didn't--I can't see where he, and I never, we never even thought of it as children.  It's just now, as you get older, you begin to think back, and I said, how, you know, really.  But the community is--he's had like--there was an article written about him, I think "Struggling on Adversity" (unclear). I mean there--he's gotten recognition from the local boards and things like that for, which I can't remember, for, more to being a pioneer because all the companies came in afterwards and, and big, and as the town developed.  But quite often, he was the first one to do it.
Speaker 1: That's something.  That's remarkable.  So, now, did he finish school?  Did he go to high school?
Speaker 2: He probably wouldn't, no, didn't go to high school.  He (unclear) would be, I would say probably till fifteen when you're out school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he was, you know, I remember as children we would, you know, he, he obviously was very, pretty good at math 'cause he was always talking about measurements.  I remember we'd, you know, plywood, I mean as growing up in the house, I remember him talking about 3 x 6 feet, you know, whatever, and so he must have somehow had some liking for math because of the, well, the carpentry, the measurement.  But I remember measurement was a big thing.  And I remember in those days, they used to--bread wasn't sliced.  They would make just a loaf, and we would be (laughter), you know, if you didn't cut it straight, he would say, "Who's cutting this bread so lean?"  He was kind of a stickler for numbers and for math, and cutting the bread--so you had to cut the bread straight.  You can't cut it--and that was such a, you know, thing that I kept, the other day I remember that.  I kept laughing.  I said, oh, he would make such a big fuss about cutting the bread crooked (laughter), not straight.  It's funny.  But that was a part of his penchant for, you know, number and accuracy and neatness and, you know, you've just gotta--
Speaker 1: So did he dress neat too?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, really, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I mean to do, accomplish all of the things he did, he must have been, had a penchant for organization too, for organizing other people--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he--
Speaker 1: --because it's hard to have a restaurant and a funeral--and all that, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they weren't simultaneously.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They were not--he probably had two or three, three or so simultaneously, but they were, you know, the restaurant phased out.  And then mom [Louise Green Martin] went to work in the store.  And then, you know, my mom did the restaurant part.  It, so he--together they were big partners, business partners.  So she then went--so she did the grocery part one time, and then the restaurant.  And she had like a little clothes store too.  They had, and then they rented out part of the building to some other people, and then, you know.  So she was a big partner with him, and then she died.  She died, I would say early.  She died at sixty-three [years], which to me is pretty early.  Now, that (laughter) I've passed sixty-three, I think it's early (laughter).  But, yeah, so they weren't all at the same time.  And he, he saw a trend, and he moved, and he, you know, and he moved, you know, and he moved on and kind of thing like that.  But even to have that desire to, to move on, to do a new thing, you know, he--I think he, in retrospect, he had his penchant for pioneering, doing something new and probably obviously not, not afraid to take risks.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It must be that because each, to do something new, you have to, you know, it's unknown, and you--you know, but obviously, he did take risks.
Speaker 1: Yeah, did he have to go to school to--
Speaker 2: No, he never, he never went to school.
Speaker 1: I mean to become a funeral director, did he have to go to school for that?
Speaker 2: He hired people who were (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, he hired somebody--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's, that's the kind of person like he is.  In fact, right now, the person who, his grandson who went to England, got his degree, is the one who manages the funeral home right now, one of--my sister's son, yeah.  But, no, he would, you know, he was that, you know, kind of person, where, you know, if he doesn't have, have the, you know, he would organize.  He would hire people to do that.
Speaker 1: That's something, that's something.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and he was pretty--he talked a lot (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did he?  Okay.
Speaker 2: He lectures you constantly, and (laughter) if you call him for his birthday, you can't get off the phone (laughter).  Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 31204
Speaker 1: So, so is there a story about how your--well, do you know the name of the school your mother [Louise Green Martin and Leonard Percival Martin] went to at all?
Speaker 2: St. Ann's (unclear), no.  I--
Speaker 1: Or your father?
Speaker 2: Because they weren't, they would--within the public school was their elementary school 'cause they didn't go beyond fifteen [years old] in those days.  And you out school, that was the word, you "out school" at fifteen.  You could do, if you're a girl, you could do dressmaking or you, how, you know, those are the skills in the small towns in which they lived.  So, or you went to work in the home with somebody and, but there was no second, no secondary education, no, beyond that for them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But my mother did have a desire for us (laughter), I mean one of the things--it's remarkable, I'm thinking back how remarkable, the day that we, we couldn't speak--Jamaican's speak Patois a lot.  We, you know, local.  But we could not speak Patois in our home.  We had to speak English.  She insist--they both insisted, and we were known around the Martin children for speaking English, you know, because we couldn't, you know, it was just not--and so they had this thing in them, I think, that kind of--I remember I was twelve [years old] when she wrote a letter--I never forget this.  The best high schools were in Kingston [Jamaica], right.  Kingston is the capital of Jamaica.  So invariably, if you were born in the rural area, you would have to--now, they do have high schools in the rural area.  But when I was growing up, there weren't any high schools.  You had to go to Kingston.  And I remember--the first time I heard the word, "desirous" was, she had written a letter saying to Arden High School, which is a big high school, "I'm desirous of my daughter attending high school."  And I'd never heard the word, "desirous" before, and she--but, you know, they obviously--she, when she went to, left St. Ann's, (unclear) went to Port Maria, she was brought up in a home--she lived with a family who became our family now.  Like when I went back home, we invite them to things and stuff like that.  And they, it was a family that must--they must have had an impact on her 'cause they were, the husband was, we called him Busha, what do you call it?  It was a head of a plantation thing, and the wife was a homemaker, and she taught her to bake and to do all the home things, and--'cause that's what women did in those days.  But they were, the speaking, and then the Catholic church.  They spoke, you know, so that's where--my, I'm retrospect.  I'm just saying that's where they got it from.  But we were really brought up in speaking proper English at home which wasn't particularly common, generally, for, for families who weren't college educated.
Speaker 1: Can, while we're on the subject, can you give us an example of Patois, what it would sound like to say something--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, Patois, I can't--
Speaker 1: --in English, like I don't know what--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, Patois, is, okay, Me-a-come.  Me-a-come means I am coming, Mia, Me-a-come, means I am coming or gimme, "give it to me".  And Patois is, you know, it has its place because some things you can say in Patois, when you try to say it in English, it doesn't really have the same impact.  And it's part of, it's become part of the culture now because we've, you know, we've incorporated it in our history in Jamaica, and we have pantomime and things in which Patois is used.  And it's used, it's, it's a part--but it's broken English mixed with a little, you know, French, you know, it--it mixed the whole, you know, it's--the slaves mixed things from their masters and mixed, you know, has a whole, is a potpourri of different things put together, but it's--obviously, it's limited to an area.  I mean the Pat--even Patois from one part of the island is a little different from another part of the island.
Speaker 1: Okay, when you say, like, say if somebody who spoke Patois in Trinidad, would they be able to understand somebody clearly from Jamaica?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they, yeah, they would be--yeah, but they--it wouldn't be identical.  Now, Trinidad has its own (unclear)--and a lot had to do with the history of the islands, like Barbados.  Barbados never changed hands.  Barbados remained English all through the period, and the impact there was--some, like Guadeloupe, Dominica and some of those islands had French.  And so the Patois is a French, T-O--P-A-T-O-I-S, that must be French.  But the word, the origin, right.  So they, it depends a lot on the history of the island and the hands that changed during the development of those islands that influenced the patois where that came--came out of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 31205
Speaker 1: Now, is there a story about how your parents [Louisa Green Martin and Leonard Percival Martin] met?
Speaker 2: How my parents met?  I think, I--let me see if I can--I think my mother, when she went to, to Saint--yeah, obviously, they must have met in Port Maria [Jamaica] (unclear) because, St. Maria because she had moved there with this family.  And this family made, I think she--there's a homemaker, the mother, but she prepared meals for teachers or nurses or police, whatever, you know, that they would carry lunch, cooked lunch.  They have a heavy meal at the middle of the day in Jamaica.  And my mother would, was the person to carry the meals.  And I think my dad would see her and liked her, and I think that's, that's pretty well how, you know, from that they--and I think the family, they were (unclear) for getting her married and, you know, that she lived with and, you know.  And they, like they know, it's pictures of baby.  In fact, when, when I was down in Jamaica two years ago, I, the daughter of that family, I, you know, we stayed together all--you know, we became, you know, they call it, we call them family there, would be considered in those days in Jamaica, what it is, brown skin.  They were like (unclear) (laughter), but they were like the upper plantation, Busha.  In those days, Busha was the head of the plantation or whatever, and that plantation, they had run, yeah, Busha, that's what you call it, yeah.  Busha is like--I don't know what the equivalent is here today 'cause we don't (unclear).  But they would be, the banana plantation would be in charge of organizing all the people and whatever.  And they were, would be kind of, a little upper, affordable, you know, their kids always went to Kingston [Jamaica] for high school and so on.  So my mother got attached to a very good home.  And this home, this host, this--so she really had a lot, I think had a lot of impact, this home had a big impact on her.  And that was from where she, you know, she told my dad, the family, you got to marry her, you know.  And, you know, they gave her away and, you know, (laughter) whatever, the whole story.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 31206
Speaker 1: How do you spell that name, Bushel or Bush--
Speaker 2: B-U-S--Busha, like Bush-"A", Busha.  A Busha was a supervisor on the plantation.  I don't know what, yeah, Busha.
Speaker 1: Is it Busha, you say?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he would wear a big hat, B-U-S-H-A, Busha.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I don't know what that's, you know, they would, you know, they would wear the khaki and they would wear the big hat, and they--the big, round, bowl hat, you know, the bowl hat that the policemen wear.  And you would, they were always fair skinned, the Busha.  And they were responsible for the, managing the whole, you know--
Speaker 1: Now, I know during the break I, we were discussing Jamaican writers that discuss like a three-tiered kind of relationship in Jamaica where the majority of the people are black, but they're on the bottom of society.  Then in the middle you have mixed-race people, and on the top white people, the smallest--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That's it.
Speaker 1: --population.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's--
Speaker 1: And so, but it, you know, it's--
Speaker 2: That's what, it's probably a little different now.  It's different now.  But when I was growing up, that was what it was.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: What you have today now is a lot of black people are up there.  Kids I went to school with, university, education just did a great thing 'cause education just picked up everybody, and, you know, now it's quite indistinguishable, but when I was growing up, that was exactly the way it was.
Speaker 1: Well, even, yeah, when you were growing up--things were breaking, that stratification is breaking down, even--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was probably breaking down--
Speaker 1: --in those days.  (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: --right, yeah.
Speaker 1: But it goes way back to the slavery days.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, here in this country, similar thing--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: But not as pronounced, I don't think as in Jamaica.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, it was pretty--

Speaker 1: Tell us your, give us your brothers and sisters and where do you fit in the--
Speaker 2: Okay, as I said, from a family of nine children, I'm second born.  My oldest sister, Yvonne, is two years older than I am.  Then I'm second born.  Then I have one brother who's two years younger.  Then I have twin sisters, our mother [Louise Green Martin] was a twin, and then I have Valerie, Carol, Faye, Mary.
Speaker 1: So how many is that all together.
Speaker 2: So I have seven sisters and one brother.
Speaker 1: Seven, okay.
Speaker 2: And I'm second born.
Speaker 1: And I know I've seen a picture of your sister, Yvonne--
Speaker 2: Yvonne.
Speaker 1: --the doctor.  Now, she's an M.D.?
Speaker 2: No, she is, no, she's Ph.D.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she was dean of the College of Education in Victoria [British Columbia, Canada].  She lives, she's Canadian.  She lives in Canada, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But we kind of, I'm closest to her because by virtue of age, two years.  And we kind of, I caught her up in university.  So we went to university together as freshmen, and then, but then I, then I left and went on to my Ph.D.  Then she followed after.  So we kind of kind of kept together a lot, and so she's been probably the closest.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 31208
Speaker 1: When you think about your parents' [Louise Green Martin and Leonard Percival Martin] personalities and dispositions, how they look, how they walk, talk, their habits, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Well, most.  My mother was a very, extremely--I keep thinking back how she had no college education, and she had so much insights.  I remember--I never forget when I was gonna get married, she wanted me to get all the data first (laughter), before I had the wedding.  She was afraid I'll get pregnant or I'll get (unclear), you know, she wanted me to get all of the data for my thesis and then get married.  And then after then, you know.  And she, she had her eyes on, she wanted me to become a physician.  And, you know, I--she spent more time--it's very hard.  My mother spent a lot of time talking with us.  At nights, we, you know, we--my dad would, was a great provider, but he went to bed early (laughter), great provider.  And so my dad, my mother was kind of humble, more of a humble, behind-the-scene, hard worker.  And, you know, I was so sorry when she died because she really never--she helped made my dad who we became, and the other woman he married after, inherited all of the money and, you know, the stuff.  So I was kind of sorry at that part.  But my dad, the ambition--we have, from both of them.  I can't take, my dad, you know, I remember him saying, never take a low-paying job.  If you take a low-paying job, it's gonna haunt you for life.  You know, she--he would say things not only to us, but to the people who worked for him, and the people he talked [to].  And we grew up hearing him.  And every morning, he would get up, he would wake up very early.  He would go to bed early and then wake up early.  And, you know, when we're trying to sleep, you hear him talking, talking, talking about plans and people and business.  So he was a, he talked a lot and we learned a lot from what he said.  But my mother had the, was the one who really pushed us.  My dad wanted all of us to be in his business 'cause he could only see that.  My mother said, no, they have to do what they have to do.  And she insisted, and she was right because in retrospect, yeah, my mother--my dad saw us as part of his, you know, was gonna be in his business.  And you this, and you this.  And my mother said, no, no, no, they have to do what they have to do.  So I can't say "most."  I think I have--my mom I'm closest to.  We're all closer because she was the one who talked us through and spent all the time with us more.  My dad, by osmosis, I learned some of the talking things from him.  But the closeness and the stuff is--it's hard to say which one, more.  I wouldn't say, I'd say--I think I've got from both of them.  I can't say more.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Probably more from my mother because my mother had a more gentle spirit, more, more--I don't know, I--
Speaker 1: They sound like remarkable people though, so.
Speaker 2: They really, I mean in retrospect 'cause, I have two children, and I didn't really appreciate my parents until (laughter), I was trying to get these two kids through (laughter).  And I wondered how did they get nine through (laughter)?
Story_ID: 31209
Speaker 1: Growing up in Jamaica, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: The sea, we lived very close to the sea.  And on a morning, you'd walk by you'd smell the salt, the spray.  Birds, the hills.  Jamaica is very, the mountains, the hills really--flowers, picking up flowers by--I became involved in science just because plant botany.  I picked up plants by the roadside.  You know, we'd pick up things, pick up leaves and organize them.  I got through science by nature, just by the wayside.  In fact, you know, we had, one of my--yeah, we didn't have expensive things.  We just had nature.  We had leaves and plants and trees and hills and sea and shells, collective shells.  That was it.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you start thinking about science when you were little, I mean like looking at these--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, yeah, I really liked--we (unclear) collect plants, I mean flowers and pick up things by the roadside.  In fact, one of--and that's pretty common with a lot of kids in Jamaica.  But we, one of my friends--he went to a different high school.  And one of his teachers would say, you know, when you, you know, when you pick up plants and you pick up things, you should always go and look for the Latin name, you know.  And, you know, it's, it was, you know, you look for the Latin, and know what you have.  You just don't say here's some--you can say, here this is a Lignum vitae [guayacan, Jamaican national flower].  Or this is a, you know, whatever it is.  And she said, and if you don't know, if you go by the roadside, and you pick up flowers, and you don't know what they are, plants.  And so when I ask you what it is, just say, "They're roadum sideum" (ph.) (laughter), you know, use the Latin roadum sideum, you know.  So it was just a, it was a big thing for, you know--it was a stimulus to go look up something, look up the leaves' shape or look, whatever it was.  And in those days, the Latin name was a big thing for plants, but I think it did, it started my, you know, we used to also have a little gutter (laughter).  In fact, it really influenced us.  When we were buying our house here, we took (unclear) lot, it had a little stream running at the back because we weren't allowed to go down--there's a little drainage area where tadpoles used to be.  And as a child, we used to love to go down and my parents [Louise Green Martin and Leonard Percival Martin] were, my mother was always worried about ringworm.  (Unclear) have ringworm, whatever, yeah, it was ringworm there.  And it's just a, it's dirty water.  It's dirty water (unclear), but tadpoles go into there and there was movement and life in it.  And if you're, if you--we'd get in trouble if we go down there.  And so when we were buying our (unclear) in Delaware we said, ah, this is gonna be great for our kids, their own little pool that they can go (laughter), you know.  It, the idea of having a little stream running at the back of your place where you could see tadpoles and little things was something.  But I think, just the nature, that's in Jamaica, it really brought the mystery of science that really left an impact on me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 31210
Speaker 1: So did your parents [Louise Green Martin and Leonard Percival Martin] bring books into the home a lot or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they, you know, we had, my big--they bought encyclopedia, they bought (unclear) books.  Yeah, they--my mother, again, you know, she really, they--oh, yes, they were big on--we were one of the few homes that had encyclopedias.  And we had these big biography books, blue books that salesmen came around selling, and she would buy it.  She would send us to the library, and we went to a church--the church played a big part in our lives too.
Speaker 1: Okay, what was the name of your church?
Speaker 2: The church that we went to was a small Brethren church, and it was called Port Maria Gospel Hall.  And the people who went there weren't very much the upper class.  It was a, if you want to use again the color to, it wasn't a very highly educated group that went to that church.  But my mom, but they went there because they--my mom was Catholic first because she was with this Catholic family.  My dad was Presbyterian because Granny, that's where Granny was.  And then they became members of this church.  They accepted Christ, they became more personal, more than a nominal church.  And then we'd go to this small church.  But there was no--not very many families there who were ever educated.  So what my mom would do, she would send us to the Anglican church group that met.  On Friday's we used to have DOK, Daughters of the King.
Speaker 1: Oh, really.
Speaker 2: DOK, and because she wanted us to learn--she wanted the Christian, the faith of this little small church, but she wanted the social aspects of the bigger church for us (laughter).  So we would, we would do things at the Anglican Church.  But we, on Sunday, we went to the little church.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the little church had more to do with their, what their belief system was, and--
Speaker 2: Right, but it, it was just mostly poor people.  It was not the upper, wealthy, you know, families there.
Speaker 1: Now, was music a big part of growing up in--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Again, my mother bought a piano.  We had a piano in the home.  My brother is a good--my sister--Yvonne is a musician, the older one.  She not only plays the piano, but she also is a soloist.  My brother plays the piano.  He plays the organ and he plays a trumpet.  And I took many years of lessons (laughter), but nothing to show for it (laughter), except that I, I bought a piano for my kids (laughter) to learn and I understand, well, both of them play as well.  But, but yes, music was a big part.  My, again, my mother insisted we--we had a piano, as small as we were (unclear), an older one, and then a newer one and then, you know, but we grew up in a home with music.
Speaker 1: What kind of music dominated the (unclear), (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, we did music lessons.  So we did the, we all--it wasn't, it was classical, classical music, yeah, and we--those who got far enough to, you know--and, of course, church music and, you know, and classical music, yeah.
Speaker 1: What about popular music?  Did that have any place?
Speaker 2: Popular music.  No, I didn't get very far with music.  I mean I, like my sister.  So, yeah, they--not, not a lot of popular music.
Speaker 1: I know when you were growing Calypso was big over here--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Calypso, oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --yeah, was big in the United States anyway.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, you know, we would sing the Calypso quietly because my dad was, wasn't too keen all the while on the lyrics (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: He thought the lyrics was, you know (laughter), that we had, you know, so we--it was kind of toned down because a lot of the Calypso was in Patois as well, and that didn't really fit with the kind of home that they wanted to bring (laughter) us up in.  So we, under our breath, (unclear) (laughter).  Isn't it interesting?  I mean there were periods--it's just in retrospect now I begin to see it.  Oh, my goodness, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any other sights, sounds and smells?
Speaker 2: Sights, sounds and--oh, the food in the tropics, were the fruits, the fruits, just you can't beat the--pineapple, bananas and, again, nature, the fruit.  The flowers, the plants, the Lignum vitae, the Luminosi plants, the fish, the sea, the, yeah, that was it.  We didn't--you know, that was what we had.  And we really enjoyed it, and they really had an impact on us.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Walking on the sand was a big thing, for us in the morning, yeah.
Story_ID: 31211
Speaker 1: Now, where did you start, what was the name of your first school?
Speaker 2: Well, infants--again, I was fortunate again in that time to be in Port Maria [Jamaica] because Port Maria was one of the few towns on the island that had an infant school that you went at age three, very few--it's not a common thing.  There was no pre-school in those days, but there was this infant school that you went at age three.  And one of those infant schools was in Port Maria and just happened to have been there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so that's where I, in retrospect, three, four, class three, class one, class two, class three.  I must have been six years--age six 'cause I was in class three.  So class one, class two, class three.  So if I was age three, four, three, four--five or probably six, I was in class six.  I can remember, well, I do remember class one, two and three.  And I must have been, clearly, at that school, but particularly class three, which was age six, five and six or five and six.
Speaker 1: But you started at age three?
Speaker 2: I started at age three.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this would have been 1947.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: And, okay.  All right, and so, but you--now, there's a story about you, I think going home to tell your mother [Louise Green Martin] you were teaching the class?
Speaker 2: That's age three.  That was class three.  What happened was, this is really strange.  Now, class three was--I keep remembering class three because, you know, what, what you did mostly then was, was socialization in class, you know.  They would play games, and you would be in a game, and you'd make a ring, and to be inclusive, they would sing a song, [singing] "All those who were born in January, get out, get out; all those who born in February, get out, get out and praises always (unclear) [singing], God save our gracious Queen."  So everybody got a chance to get out because everybody was born in a month.  So you went through the twelve months of the year as a way of teaching you the month you were born, and being inclusive.  So everybody felt they were a part of that.  And that little song, I couldn't wait for January to come, for July to come to go out.  And then you played music.  They had a triangle, and they were teaching you the things, you know, and they--the teaching then was not, you didn't sound things out.  You saw by picture.  You saw the word--the action, and you called the word.  But then in class three, my mother came in one day, and I--she said that she said--well, first of all, the teacher at the end would, when they would do tests, and then she would say, first in class, Patricia Martin, second in class, Patricia DeLeon--Linton, third in class.  And I grew up thinking that if you're named Patricia, you have to be first in class, because it was Patricia Martin and Patricia Linton.  When I got to three grade three, class three, the teacher said one day, she said, you know, we had to--she took out some kids and they would have to help the other kids.  So I thought that I was already teaching.  So anyway, so I says, mom, I was really teaching.  And she had to, she--you know, she didn't, of course, she wanted me to be a doctor, right (laughter).  So even, I mean I don't know if at that time she wanted it, but that was, she, well, she forced me to be a physician--not forced me, but encouraged me to be a physician.  But I don't know she took it, but she remembered me at class three.  So I would have been about six then when--so obviously I must have been reading ahead of some of the kids why--'cause there were some of us who were taken out to help the others.  And I was one of those who was taken out.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were a teacher (laughter)--
Speaker 2: I said, I began teaching already, already (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so infant school goes to what class?
Speaker 2: So infant school would go to class, class one, class two, class three, class four.  Then you go over to elementary school at seven or six, I think.  I think it went to class four.  I think that's what I--and then you went over to the elementary school.
Story_ID: 31212
Speaker 1: And then that was when my mother [Louise Green Martin], we had to take--she contracted with, you know, people, teachers who taught piano, took piano lessons.  And then she also--'cause she worked.  She was in the store.  She had a teacher there do, what you call it, extra lessons, after school.  So she would, would have--it was just a general thing that you had to do extra lessons, whether you needed it or not.
Speaker 2: Okay, was this like homework or in addition to homework?
Speaker 1: In addition, yeah, addition to work.  Yeah, she paid them, you know, what they were.  But after, after school--school was over at three-thirty or four [o'clock], and then you had a half an hour and you went and you spent about forty-five minutes with the teacher, and to give you extra work, whatever.  But that, I remember starting that, once we got over to the next, to that school.
Speaker 2: Okay, did your elementary school have a name?
Speaker 1: Yes, Port Maria Elementary School.
Speaker 2: All right.  All right, so you're there basically until--
Speaker 1: Then, until, so then I did first Jamaica local exam there.  So in those days the most you would--remember I told you, out school at fifteen [years], right.  They just called you "out school" whatever.  So at age thirteen, I did--they used to have the Jamaica local exams.  And your first year, second year and third year, and after you finished your third year Jamaica locals, by the time you're about fifteen, and you would go to training college for teachers if--or you would go to--these weren't degreed.  But they were, you go to training college for teachers or you go for nursing, with third year.  So I went to, I did first Jamaica Local, and then at that time, my parents transferred me to the Continuation High School.  So I did not complete the Port Maria Elementary School.  I left at thirteen, went to Continuation High School at Highgate [Jamaica], and it was more for somebody who was on a track who was going to go on to, well, if you--you can get into nursing or teaching with third Jamaica Locals, if you stayed in the elementary school.  But if you wanted a little more, you would go to this continuation school.  So that's, so I went there at thirteen, after I passed the first Jamaica local exam.
Story_ID: 31213
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back on grade school, were you, can you see your interests in science developing?
Speaker 2: Yes, I remember that when you do--and math mostly.  When you did the, I was pretty good at math, and when you did Jamaica local exam, they always called CAP.  CAP means distinction, when you cap something--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you cap it, essentially.  And I capped math, and I think my parents [Louise Green Martin and Leonard Percival Martin] were pretty--to cap math, you know, most people were failing math.  And I capped math.  So I think math was, yeah, I think, I think I, you know, I pretty well--other than the fact being, you know, first in class, yeah, thinking that if you're named Patricia, you had to be first (laughter) or second in class.  And then, you know, I thought, a three-year old, if you, every time, first, Patricia Martin, second, Patricia DeLeona, so I figured that was, was an alphabetical thing kind of (laughter), you know.  So I think I had a fairly good high school--good--and then when I went, to tell you, when I went to Continuation High School, my sister, Yvonne, who's older than I am, 'cause she's two years older, right?  So she went before I did 'cause she did--at the same pattern.  And she would have been doing third Jamaica local exam because she was two years ahead.  And after I passed my first Jamaica local exam, and was feeling good about myself, I said to my mom, I'm gonna skip second and go to third and do it with my sister, while she was doing her third.  And, of course, didn't go (laughter), she didn't like this idea at all.  But my mother, I said that with another girl--Galley, was her name, would also cap math and had also gone to the same school with me.  And we decided, let us--because everybody always said the second year was always harder than third year.  So I said, well, if second year is harder than third year, why don't we just do third year straight and skip second year?  So we signed up on our own to do third year, and my mom did send me to some extra private lessons because I was interested in doing that.  And then the teacher at the continuation school heard that we were doing this and invited us to come in, towards the end, invited us to come into the class.  She couldn't believe every, you know, but she didn't want to discourage us.  And, of course, my sister didn't love this.  And she would hide her notes from me and stuff.  And I did, and I failed.  We failed.  We didn't pass (laughter) that second year.  So we, we passed it, we passed it the year we should have passed it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, what level of math were you on in those days at--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I think I--the math, when I went on to Excelsior [School], start to doing real math--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Were you doing algebra, geometry and--
Speaker 2: Geometry, yeah, in fact, I did do one-point math.  I was one of the, I was the only girl who, what do you call this, trigonometry--what, in those days, you did Cambridge exams, right?  So when you went to Excelsior, you (unclear).  And you had, after you did school certificate, you did six--senior's school certificate, and then there's it senior school certificate.  And then-(unclear) so in school certificate, I also did, I also capped math too, I think.  Yeah, I capped math.  And then they put me in one-point math which, with some boys that were physics and stuff.  And I mean I, I didn't like it because I didn't know what it was for.  I--they didn't relate the math to something that was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --life.
Speaker 1: So this was like a calculus or something or early beginning (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No I'd done calculus, I did calculus.  Yeah, I did calculus.  Yeah, it was, yeah, it was calculus.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it didn't, you know, dY over dX.  It didn't, they didn't connect it to something.  And I, I didn't, you know, that was really the end of my math.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, not the end of my math.  Doing science, you need math, you know, physics, you need chemistry and so when I--but I mean seeing math as a course.  I was more interested in doing things that was gonna help people and plant, you know, plant alkaloids or, you know, whatever.  But, but I did--but I was good at math ever since, you know, whatever math was called, as soon as, as early as I can remember.
Story_ID: 31214
Speaker 1: Now, were there any teachers on the elementary level or the lower level that really were--
Speaker 2: Impacted me?
Speaker 1: --inspiration, yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes, all the way.  In the elementary level, it was mostly the teachers, the teacher who, that my mom [Louise Green Martin]--who I did lessons with in the evening, Ms. Sims and Ms. Brian.  And then when my mother--when I was, decided to go, to skip second, and do the third, she got this teacher who was Ms. Hines.  And she paid her privately to tutor me.  And I, she really, I think, had an impact because she did a lot of the, a lot of the physiology, botany and the plants, soils and things like that.  She really drilled in me, I mean helped me with, and I really--it was fun.  I mean I liked, when you leave class, you could walk and you can look at the soil.  You could--it was nature.  It was around you.  It was conn--you were connected to it.  You're engaged in it.  And that was why I had a hard--I couldn't go, well, calculus, I couldn't go any further because I couldn't relate it to anything in my being.  And it was just not, you know--but I think, and it has really helped me as a professor to really relate what I do, what, to teach to life because people see things in a context, you know.  You need a platform in which you can do it, and 'cause when you can actually leave the classroom and pick a leaf and say, oh, here's a venation that we were studying or here is this.  It, it makes it meaningful.
Story_ID: 31215
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were talking about the ability, I guess the importance of being able to apply mathematics to--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --some real situation.  And you were saying that it--
Speaker 2: Yeah, some recent studies show that, you know, because there's this big concern about girls--not a concern, this is the fact that girls, there are few girls in the STEM [science, technology, engineering and mathematics] field.  And I've kind of devoted my last few (unclear) years (unclear) career to try encouraging girls in science.  And I follow the literature, and they've actually noted that if the, if they teach the material in the context of what it's used for, what it's value--why it's important in society and communities, girls do catch on to it, and do well.  And I mean the example I gave you with the bridges.  When they were doing things about tensile strength and whatever, they said why it's so important to have this because if you can't connect these communities, its towns, then the whole of, you know.  And then girls, they understand it.  So I think the context is really important.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, all right, so you were at Continuation High School [St. Mary, Jamaica] at age thirteen, and--
Speaker 2: Through fifteen--
Speaker 1: To fifteen, okay.
Speaker 2: For two years (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay, now, so, but you weren't "out school" at fifteen (laughter)?
Speaker 2: No, right, because you out, you're only out elementary school.  Continuation High School was a private, was a secondary school.  You paid to go there.  You had to, you know, it's a--in those days, you paid for secondary school.  Right, so at fifteen, well, I outed really--well, at fifteen, I had done third Jamaica local exam.  And I was ready to move on, and then I went to Excelsior [School].  So that's where probably the second (unclear), I don't know--
Speaker 1: So Excelsior is like a college prep high school?
Speaker 2: Right.  It's a college--you go there when you are ten or twelve [years old].
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: You see.
Speaker 1: So most people go there when they're ten or twelve?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: It's twelve to--but I went there at fifteen.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so you went--
Speaker 2: I didn't go in first form.  I went right to fourth form.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So having completed third Jamaica local exam, I went directly into fourth form and, yeah, fourth and fifth, for a school certificate.  And then, it's like the college prep, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, everybody's there who's, is really college bound when they're trying to or they're trying to prepare themselves for college life?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but not, yeah, but not everybody.  Yeah, the college bound--I wouldn't say everybody is, but if you're college bound, that's where you go.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Because some end up going to nursing--well, now, I guess in those days, nursing and teaching, you didn't go to college for that.  There were teaching college--teacher, teaching, yeah, I guess you can call it.  They probably call them colleges now.  I don't know if they do.  But nursing and teaching were professions that you did--they weren't in universities.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, where you have, you know, where you have a, you know, you had a nursing training college or a nursing training school or teacher training school.
Speaker 1: Okay, like a Normal school was in the old days here in the United States where they have a two-year school for teachers and--
Speaker 2: Right, right, something like that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: But Excelsior, if you were really gonna go on to college, that's where you have to go, to a school like that.
Story_ID: 31216
Speaker 1: Now, we've read that you had some mentors at Excelsior [School, Kingston, Jamaica], Mr. Goodbody and--
Speaker 2: No, that's at university.
Speaker 1: University, okay, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Excelsior was Mr. Errol Miller.
Speaker 1: Errol Miller, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and that was really--it was interesting.  Let me just tell you a little thing about the--when you get into, when you go--that might be what you can probably call (unclear).  When you go at grade four, just like in your schools, you begin at grade one, grade two, or first grade, second grade, third grade, fourth grade, fifth grade.  Fifth grade, you do a school certificate.  So if you're going at age fifteen, and I've passed Jamaica local, they put you in fourth grade, right.  But most people in fourth grade, they have like six different fourth grades, 4-A, 4-B, 4-C, 4-D, 4-E and 4-F.  4-A would do physics.  4-B would, physics and chemistry and math and B would do the languages and C would do that.  Now, if you got in at 4--if you started school--if you're in 4-A, you started at 1-A, 4-A, you're in 1-A, 2-A, 3-A, 4-A, you start straight up, the same trend, right, you see.  First grade, you have 1-A, 1-B, 1-C, 1-D, 1-E, 2-A, 2-B, 2-C, 2-D, 2-E.  So if you're in A, if you start in A stream, you continue A stream all the way up.  When you enter at fourth stream like I did at fifteen rather than at twelve or eleven, most of those people do home economics.  They don't--you get math and so on, but you don't have--and you do biology.  But chemistry and physics are not given in--that's in E stream because to get chemistry and physics, you have to start general sciences early on.  And, you know, you do general sciences, and you go up and you--that.  But I went into four, 4-E, and I did, my only science that I had was biology.  And the, you know, but my plants, my botany and I was (unclear), you know, but now realizing that I had to go, I would need the cognitive courses like chemistry and physics, I was at a loss because you can't go to university with just biology.  You need the other (unclear) courses.  So Mr. Errol Miller was the one who lobbied for me to get--so, no, I had actually done my fifth grade, finished fourth, finished fifth, finished my school certificate.  And then now, to make--the last two years before I go to college, I needed some more (unclear) courses which is unheard of.  You don't do the entire five years of chemistry in one week.  And Mr. Errol Miller was the one who lobbied for me to get a special, extra lessons in chemistry so I could come up the five years in chemistry and become a scientist because I would need, I would have needed to have at least chemistry 'cause I only had biology and math.  There was no physics or chemistry.  And so Errol Miller played an important role in that 'cause he was my biology teacher.  He saw that I was doing very well and I got capped in biology when I did it, it was, you know, top in--and also one of the things was, Excelsior had a thing that you had these five streams for A, B, C, D, E, sometimes F.  They would give a prize to the person with the highest average in all of the A, B, C, D, E.  And I got that a couple of years, so they gave, they felt that that was good enough reason to take a chance and put me through the chemistry, through five years of chemistry in one week, in one semester so I could reach up to do it.
Speaker 1: Now, that sounds like it would be difficult to do.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it would be difficult, but, you know, if you're motivated, you know, at time, and it was, yeah--and I had been accustomed to this idea of lessons because of my mother [Louise Green Martin] starting these (laughter) lessons with the teacher, you know, she--as I said, they didn't go to college.  They didn't go to high school.  So they hired, they--we started lessons, remember I started lessons as soon as I got over to elementary school.  So it wasn't a big deal for me to get chemistry lessons on a Saturday because the idea of lessons was sort of a thing I was doing in the past.  But if I hadn't done that, I wouldn't have been able to be a scientist.
Speaker 1: Okay, was that the second chance they were talking about in (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That could be--
Speaker 1: --that might be.
Speaker 2: --that could be an interpretation, yeah, because you don't usually--people, biology, you don't really become a--yeah, most people who do 4-E, they do home economics.  They do Spanish.  They don't--E, E stream is not a stream that does science.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay, so with his help, with Earl Miller's help--
Speaker 2: Errol Miller, yeah.
Speaker 1: Earl Miller, is he a black Jamaican or is he--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, he's a brown-skinned Jamaican.
Speaker 1: Okay, there is difference.  And see, yeah, that's interesting.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's a brown-skinned Jamaican.  He's now actually Dr. Miller.  He's now head of, dean of college.  He's, he had a real big impact on me-he was my biology teacher.
Story_ID: 31217
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so at Excelsior [School, Kingston, Jamaica], are all the students black?  I mean are all--
Speaker 2: Oh, no, it's a big mix so--
Speaker 1: Are there any white students in--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah.  Excelsior is one of the best, one of the best co-educational schools.  Other schools in Jamaica are single-sex schools.  So you have boys' schools and girls' schools.  And they're run by churches.  So Excelsior was a Methodist church, and it was the most prominent co-educational school.  It had both males and females.  And so you had, yeah, white, a lot of the English patriots send their kids there, the English, you know, and brown--always mostly black, but--
Speaker 1: Okay, so when you start, this is about 19--
Speaker 2: Fifty--two years before Kennedy died [President John F. Kennedy].  I remember the very day when Kennedy died, where I was under--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the tree.  I was doing my exam.  I never forget that.
Speaker 1: Okay, this was two years before Kennedy died?
Speaker 2: No, when Kennedy died, I was in sixth forum.  It was sixty--in '67 [1967] or--
Speaker 1: '63 [1963].
Speaker 2: '63 [1963], he died?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Yes, '63 [1963], right, yeah.
Speaker 1: So this is, we're talking about the late '50s [1950s] and really, when you're in--
Speaker 2: Excelsior.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I started Excelsior when I was fifteen [years old], so if you--fifteen to '44 [1944] is '59 [1959]--
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: 1959, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  All right, so what did--did you have like good science facilities there at Excelsior?
Speaker 2: Much better than what I saw when I went two years ago.  I mean, no, it--again, they were, I don't know what to compare it with, you know.  I mean I was a student.  I was, as I said before, we had--there was, yeah, they were probably okay because our students did well.  We had students who did well in science.  But I, I--not having compared it with anything else, I can't say how, you know--
Speaker 1: Okay, did you have like labs and, you know--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, oh, yes, we had labs, oh, yes.  We had a nice, we had labs, nice labs (unclear).  I remember the chemistry lab there so much, and we used to do--we used to get this unknown sample, and we had to find out what the elements were.  You know, elements are in group, group one, two, three and four.  And I would hear the boys--it was mostly, there were mostly boys then in the class.  They would say, you know, one guy, Errol Morrison, who was a bright guy, you know, said, what do we get--if it's a group one, if it's group two [clearing throat] (laughter).  They would clear their throat, one, two, three and four.  And, of course, you know, I would never listen to them because I, you know, you know, and I will be burning my barium on the Bunsen burner trying to find what it is.  And all these guys were there [clearing throat] (laughter).  But it was, it was a nice lab.  It was just, it was--we had good facilities.  Well, I mean they were--I had fond memories of being in lab, I should say 'cause I couldn't compare it to any--I had no other one to go to, but we, I learned a lot, and we did all the things, experiments.
Speaker 1: So when you got into the sciences, you said there weren't that, weren't as many females students?
Speaker 2: Un-un, un-un.
Speaker 1: Okay, what would you think would be the ratio?
Speaker 2: The, there were, I remember three girls.  There was Tammie, myself, in the--I was the only girl in the math class, the advanced calculus math class.  But then in the chemistry class, there was probably four girls, and then the rest were guys.  It was like sixteen out of twenty, yeah.  I mean I, you know, yeah, it's as always, there weren't very many, many girls in there, definitely not.  And I think it's even worse.  I don't think there's anybody in, in the physics, I don't think there was any girls in the physics.  It might be one girl if there was--yeah, there was one girl in physics.  There was one girl.  I remember one girl who was in physics, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, I didn't ask you like, now, Excelsior was in Kingston [Jamaica], right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So who did you live with when you were--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --did you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Boarding--
Speaker 1: It's a boarding school?
Speaker 2: Well, my--no, not a boarding school.  What my mother [Louise Green Martin] did was, because I had an older sister, Yvonne, we rented a room in a home.  The boarding was too expensive.  To board, it's, boarding was more expensive than tuition.  But it wasn't expensive to rent, to rent a room.  So we rented a room, and she sent us the food, and we made our own, we made our own meals.  So it was a--we rented, it was a rented room.  But it was, you know, it was a home, I mean, a home where we went to the same church that the people went.  She wanted a home that the people were Bible believing, were church people, and so she had a room in that home that she thought we would be safe.  It would be a good environment for us, and we lived with them for the entire high school, from the entire five years at Excelsior.
Speaker 1: So they were the same denomination as your--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --mother?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, um-hum.
Story_ID: 31218
Speaker 1: Excelsior [School], did they have like activities in, like at other high schools, or clubs and--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, sports, oh, yes--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: and that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Did you get involved in all that?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was involved, well, (laughter) I wasn't, my sister was a good athlete, (unclear), you know, I wasn't, I tried (laughter).  I tried it, but I didn't make it anything.  Track, track was a big thing that we did, track and field hockey were the big things that, you know, sports that don't require an expense (laughter).  Track, you just run.  But was involved in, in SCM, which is Student Christian Movement.  It was a church, SCM, or inter--yeah, Student Christian Movement, where we--at club after class, one evening per week.  I was, I also tried out for, for, not debating, for drama, but I didn't really (laughter) do so well, didn't get any places.  But, but I was school captain, and I had, I was a prefect, and I had other group things to go because of leadership roles that I had held.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, so, now, when you graduated, I mean were your grades really, were you still at the top of your class?
Speaker 2: I, yeah, they were because I got a full scholarship to University of the West Indies.  I wouldn't know if I was, yeah, oh, I got an honors degree, so it must be, yes.  It was a, yeah, when you graduate, you just take a regular degree, and you can get first-class honors, second-class honors, or you can get third-class.  And I got second-class honors.  So I was probably in the upper fourth of the class or so.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 31219
Speaker 1: So you got a full scholarship to the University of the West Indies?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Now, this is important because, you know--
Speaker 2: Well, it was in those days, you know, that's why I (unclear).  If you, it was, it wasn't so uncommon if you, you know, I was in the science.  I was, they needed people in, they needed science teachers.  So, and my second-class honors would have put me in that category.  But a lot of my other friends got help too.
Speaker 1: Okay, I know we didn't mention this on camera, but one important incident from Excelsior [School, Kingston, Jamaica] is that you went to the principal, A. W. Powell, right?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And, well, tell us that story.
Speaker 2: Yes, well, this is what, what I thought the second chance was (unclear).  I did not get a scholarship to Excelsior as--because those were given at 10-plus.  Those scholarships are, scholarship entrance exam.  You take it between ten and twelve [years old].  But because between ten and twelve, I was at elementary school still, then I didn't get the scholarship to there.  So if you go in at fourth grade like I did, you don't get government aide.  So the governments, government aide helps the family to pay for a secondary education.  And the full scholar--the full fees were nineteen pounds.  If you had aid, you paid 8 pounds, 10 schillings which was what my sister [Yvonne Newcombe] was paying.  By the time, I, my time came around, the rule was that you had to pay full fees, if you're going in at fourth grade.  So when I went in at fourth grade, I knew that my father [Leonard Percival Martin], my father was paying 8 pounds, 10 schillings for my older sister.  I knew I had seven more siblings behind me to come.  And I saw that I was doing, you know, I was coming, not only the top of my class, but the top of all four, A, B, C, D, E.  I had the highest average.  And so I figured, well, why should I pay more for the same education that they're getting, and I know that my parents--so I went to Mr. Powell, and I told him that I, you know, my sister pays 8 pounds, 10, and my parents have nine children.  And she wanted to send us all, and, you know, if there's anything they could do to give me grant and aid and bring the fees down from 19 pounds to 8 pounds, right, 8 pounds, 8 pounds, 10 schillings, I think.  Twenty schillings make a pound, right, 8 pounds, 10 schillings.
Story_ID: 31220
Speaker 1: Okay, we were telling the story about--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I lobbied Mr. [A.W.] Powell [principal, Excelsior School, Kingston, Jamaica] and he did.  Te next year my fees were reduced from 19 pounds to 8 pounds, 10 [shillings].  So I finished my career at Excelsior paying, as an honor with a grant and aid.  I got the grant and aid.  So that was helpful for my family and, you know, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, did you get a chance to go home [Port Maria, Jamaica] much when you were in Kingston [Jamaica; Excelsior School]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, we, yeah, we had the summers to go home, yeah, we went home in summer, and there's--yeah, a long summer vacation and Christmas vacation.
Speaker 1: How many miles is it from Port Maria [Jamaica] to--
Speaker 2: Right, that's a good question.  The island is only forty-four miles wide and 144 miles long, but the roads are kind of a meandering.  So it's probably about forty-three miles from Port Maria to Kingston by the time you do all the maneuvering, yeah.  So it would be, on a bus trip, it would be two hours or something like that.
Speaker 1: Um-hum, okay, because of the roads and--
Speaker 2: Yes, it's not--you don't have highways laughter)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --from that route.  There're highways on the north coast once you get by the tourist areas.  But the non-tourist areas don't have highways.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 31221
Speaker 1: So, all right, so University of the West Indies, now, this is the Mona [Jamaica] campus.  I'm not sure--how many campuses are on the island?
Speaker 2: So they had Mona campus, and they have the Trinidad campus.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: And then they had--at the time.  And then there's a Barbados campus.  Barbados had the law faculty and Trinidad had the engineering and the medical faculty and the rest of the liberal arts are at the Mona.  But now, they have almost, independent campuses on these islands.  And there are other--no, it's just the one Mona campus still in Kingston [Jamaica].  But it's been expanded, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so at University of the West Indies, had you decided on your major when you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know it was gonna be ZooBotChem (ph.), right.
Speaker 1: You knew it was gonna be what, you say?
Speaker 2: Zoology, botany and chemistry.  It wasn't gonna--Zoo, but, Zoo, call it ZooBotChem, zoology, which is, which today, we don't have--we call it biology.  But it was the study of animals, zoology, and then botany, plants, and then chemistry.  So those were the three courses that you would do.  And you have to decide whether you're gonna go to medical school from high school because we do two years--we do a year of--we only spend three years at university, right?  So we do, we do one university year at high school.  So once you finish high school in '63 [1963], was it '63 [1963] or whatever, yeah, then you go to, spend three more, just three years to get your degree because one of the years in high school is equivalent or the first year of college.
Story_ID: 31222
Speaker 1: Now, was your last year [at Excelsior School, Kingston, Jamaica] the year that President [John F.] Kennedy was shot?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, okay, your last year in high school.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and--
Speaker 2: I remember it so clearly.
Speaker 1: Yeah, was he important to the people of Jamaica?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I mean he was, yeah.  I remember it--I was under the Lignum vitae tree.  And we heard Kennedy was shot, and it was just--because it seemed like, so much that he was for, you know, black people (laughter).  And it just seemed that this icon had disappeared overnight.  Yeah, I remember it so clear.  That was my last--we were actually doing--it was in November.  And we were actually--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Was it November?  Yeah, I think--
Speaker 1: Yeah, November the 23rd.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we were doing our final exams because our school used to run from January to December.  We were doing our final exams for the school certificate, the senior school certificate, yeah, which is the one year part for college, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so you never know, you know, how something like that is gonna affect people around the world.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I mean it was, we got back from the exam, and we couldn't even, you know, we were--they allowed us to kind of cool off for a while before we did our exam, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, in 1963, was there a close affinity between the United States and, I mean American culture and what was going on--and what you all were doing as teenagers in Jamaica?  Did you have a, did you have TV when you were growing up?  Or--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, we had TV--TV came in '62 [1962]--well, I don't know if TV came (unclear).  Well, we had TV, but I had an American pen pal.  We used to have pen pal in those days, a pen pal from Illinois that you would write.  And, yeah, I mean a lot of Jamaicans come to America on vacation, and they work while they're here.  So there was always--my mother [Louise Green Martin] even, we had all relatives in Jamaica, relatives in New York would come from, from St. Ann's Bay and lived in, you know, my grand aunt, my mother's-my mother's, mother's sister.  She was a Knight, and K-N-I--the name was Knight.  I was just, K-N-I-G-H-T, yeah.  So there has been good flow because people, you know--and there were people who would stow away on boats.  I had a cousin--I had an uncle who stowed away on a banana boat.  And he had no papers, so he couldn't go back to Jamaica.
Speaker 1: So he couldn't go back to Jamaica, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, because he came to this country on a banana boat, stowaway under the railing, you know, and so he had no legal papers here.  So when all this friends would go back to Jamaica on vacations, he couldn't go back because he didn't have any bonafide papers for this country.
Speaker 1: So if you left, you might not be able to come back again?
Speaker 2: Exactly, whatever, yeah, yeah.  But there was a lot of, you know, in those days.  In the banana boat, I remember (unclear) you could stow away on it, yeah.
Story_ID: 31223
Speaker 1: All right so, University of the West Indies [Mona campus, Jamaica], and now, this is where you had mentorship from Professor Ivan Goodbody, yeah.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  He was a zoology professor.
Speaker 1: Okay, so was he the main person there that you--
Speaker 2: He was a professor of zoology, but he, he was in charge--he impacted me 'cause he was, you know, he took us out to Port Royal [Jamaica] to collect--we had a project there collecting shells and marine animals and, you know, that was what my, you know, collecting--I'm going from collecting plants to animals now.  So it was, you know, he had an impact on me.  And, actually, he recommended me for, when I--to do my master's [degree], the, there was somebody--the woman with whom I did my master's asked him to recommend somebody who could come and work as a research assistant and at the same time get her master's degree.  And he recommended me for that position, and that really was what started me in the career in genetics, going into the hospital to actually work with children who were having birth defects and trying to find what the chromosomal basis about the defect was.  It was Professor Goodbody's recommendation that got me there, and I--he got, I guess he got to know me.  And he had an, yeah, he, I remember I liked what he was teaching.  And, you know, it was kind of fun, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 31224
Speaker 1: Now, did you get a chance to do any research in undergraduate school [University of the West Indies, Mona campus, Jamaica]?
Speaker 2: Yes, well, the project--yes, we did, yeah.  We, it wasn't the kind of research--what we did was, we would, in the summer, we would go out to Port Royal [Jamaica], which is the harbor and look at the, we had a plot in the water, and tried to look at the ecological, the food chain in that region, looking at the various invertebrate animals and how they form food for the next strain up line.  So that was a project we, the kind of research, but like we said, we would of, I would have done, that really, sort of got me close to Professor [Ivan] Goodbody and--
Speaker 1: And so observation--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Observation, right.  Yeah, he, he also--he worked with tunicates.  Tunicates are the animals in between an echinoderms, like starfish, and, and vertebrates.  And I'm hoping, I hope I have this correct.  It's a long time now since I did this.  But he--
Speaker 1: So a starfish is a tunicate?
Speaker 2: No, a starfish is an echinoderm.
Speaker 1: Okay, echinoderm, okay.
Speaker 2: But the tunicates come in between the star, I think the starfish and invertebrates, the starfish, you know, but I'm--don't quote me on that because it's been over forty years since (laughter) I looked at that.  But, but he--tunicates I remember he, that was his, you know, he was studying the various varieties and looking the different and how they related to other organisms in the same ecological (unclear).  So we took one particular part of the water and looked at, collected all the animals there, put them in their classification and show how their presence there impacted the others and looking at ecological niche and the relationship between the organisms.
Story_ID: 31225
Speaker 1: Now, you were still at Excelsior [School] in your last couple of years of school when Jamaica achieved independence from--
Speaker 2: [1962], yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So what did that mean for you in those days, and how did people--what was the--
Speaker 2: It was a time of national pride and a time when we, you know, we had a competition for deciding what our flag would be like, what colors it would have.  We wanted black, yellow and gold.  We didn't want any of the red, white and blue from the (laughter)--we thought that United States had not really separated from Britain.  They had the same red, white and blue.  We wanted, you know, and there was, coming up with our national song, national anthem was a, you know, in schools, we had competitions.  It was just a very, it was a time of, vibrant time of, of national pride and culture, bringing your culture in and having it done peacefully with no--which was, you know, unfortunately, we had broken away, a couple of years before that they had tried to have a Federation of the Islands.  And for selfish reasons, some of the islands, the big, the bigger island pulled out, like Jamaica because they thought they would be giving more than they would be getting, which was a little, not nice, selfish.  So with the Federation going down, and this national, this independence coming up, it was, it was, you know, we made.  We felt we made it, and it was a wonderful for young--for everyone, but for, I think young people at the time, nice to know that now you're going to be--seeing the Jamaican flag and singing Jamaican anthem, and--
Speaker 1: Who was, who became the president of Jamaica and like who did you all see as your national heroes at that moment of independence.
Speaker 2: Well, we had, we have a place where we have all the national heroes, like Marcus Garvey [Jamaican political leader and proponent of Black Nationalism and Pan-Africanism movements] and some of the other men who were national heroes, but most, I can't, you know, I can't remember who, whether it was Manley or Bust--Manley in power or, or Manley or Bustamante or the father Manley or the--Norman Manley or--there are two Manleys, the father and the son.
Speaker 1: Well, Michael Manley was the one--
Speaker 2: Michael.
Speaker 1: --who was the, he was the, I guess--do they call it Prime Minister or--
Speaker 2: Prime Minister, right.
Speaker 1: --of Jamaica, yeah.  Yeah, he was, when Bob Marley was--
Speaker 2: When Bob Marley, yeah.
Speaker 1: --in his prime.  Was he the first?  I don't know.
Speaker 2: I can't remember to--I can't remember.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it seemed like it was somebody else before him, but I--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I can't remember who was the Prime Minister--
Speaker 1: But it was a Manley--
Speaker 2: It was a, well, there was the father, Norman, and there's the son, Michael, and there was Seeaga (ph.), who was a JOP, the two, there were two national parties, just like you.  There's the People's National Party and the Jamaica Labor Party, and Michael Manley was the People's National Party, and Seeaga was the Jamaican Labor Party.  I remember those people, but I can't quite remember who was--I mean at the time, it wasn't the party.  It was the country.  The focus was on "We are gonna make our little island, you know, our own."  So that was really the focus.
Speaker 1: This was an exciting time.  I just thought I'd make sure I asked you about that before--
Speaker 2: Yes, it was an exciting time.
Story_ID: 31226
Speaker 1: Okay, so at University of West Indies, you're in zoology and--
Speaker 2: --botany and chemistry.
Speaker 1: So in the British system, now, did you basically study exclusively science when you were--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, you see I was so glad when I went back to Jamaica two, a couple of years ago.  It was really pure science.  There was very little application.  When I went back, I was so pleased to see they were doing pharmacology.  They were doing applied microbiology, stuff that can lead directly to jobs.  I was brought up with the trend that you learn for learning's sake.  It didn't, it didn't have to apply.  That was, that was particularly, yet, I go back to math where I say that I found calculus unrelatable because I couldn't see-they, the way it was taught, I couldn't see why I would need to have those kinds of skills.  Yet, when it came to the other areas, Zoo-Bot-Chem, you know, you--the focus was on, was, for my first degree was just getting those body of knowledge, regardless of what, you know.  But then once I finished my honor graduate, I wanted to go into graduate school.  I wanted to do something that was applicable to humans.  It was very interesting that I, you know, I wanted to do something that could help people and had some direct impact on.  But what we had in those days were three courses.  We had no, we had very little liberal education.  It was, we had a course, use of English course, a history of the Caribbean, and a history of civilization.  Those are the only things we did.  And we did them the first year.  Other than that, all we did was Zoo-Bot-Chem.  So it was pretty--
Speaker 1: Okay--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --pretty focused.
Speaker 1: So even the focus of zoology, botany and chemistry excluded like, did you take any physics or anything in college--
Speaker 2: Well, you would do Phys-Chem.  You had Zoo-Bot-Chem.  You could do Zoo-Chem, Zoo-Chem-Phys or you could do geology, physics chem.  There were three's that you could do it, and my combination was Zoo-Bot-Chem.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There were three that you had to do, and so you could--you do physics-math-geology or physics-math-chemistry or, you know, other combinations, but my combination was Zoo-Bot-Chem.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I did physical chemistry.  A lot of physical chemistry had physics in it too.  So, but that was how it was packaged in those days.  The packaging today is a lot more, less pure science and more applied science.  And so people can do a program that will directly lead them into pharmacy or directly lead into microbiology.  But it's a lot more applied than it was when I was there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 31227
Speaker 1: So when you were on the verge of graduating from college, what was your, what were your prospects?  What were you looking at in terms of--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right, so then I was--I knew I wanted to go into graduate school.  And I was gonna do, Professor [Ivan] Goodbody, I was gonna do zoology--it was between zoology and chemistry 'cause those--see I, you begin with Zoo-Bot-Chem in your first year, and after your first year, you drop one.  And then you focus on the other two.  So I dropped botany after the first year and focused on Zoo-Bot-Chem.  So for graduate school, I thought I was gonna be the--you have to remember that I had decided not to go to medical school because that decision has to be made from high school.  So, in part, and partly because money too.  You know, I was a free scholarship to do this versus my parents would have to get money to send me to medical school.  Not that I couldn't get in.  I could get in easily, but having seven siblings behind, you know.  But in the long run, this is what, really what I should have been doing, I mean, you know, in retrospect, this is--so I knew I wanted to do graduate school, and I, I thought one of the things I became interested in at that time was studying some of the active principles of certain plants in Jamaica, what using--you know, the Caribbean is, has the widest variety of species of flora and (unclear) because of the weather, the temperature, the solar system.  And so you've got varieties that don't exist elsewhere.  And so I wanted to look at some of the active principles in certain plants.  And there's a lot of plants they use medicinally in Jamaica without knowing why they, you know, specifically why people do it.  The Bush teas, they make teas from plants and not knowing.  So I thought that I would do either that or with Prof. Goodbody, something in zoology, but I was more tending towards chemistry because my--I got higher marks in chemistry.  I liked chemistry more.  And then Prof. Goodbody called me and said that there was this opportunity at the hospital to do, to work as a research associate and get my master's [degree] at the same time.  And I thought that was ideal because that would have direct applications.  I'm gonna look at children who were born with mental retardation and find what went wrong.  That was a lot more interesting and with a direct impact.  So I, upon his recommendation, I was taken on as a research assistant.  And--
Speaker 1: So this is, is this a hospital associated with--
Speaker 2: The university.
Speaker 1: University.
Speaker 2: The University of West Indies Hospital, medical hospital where the physicians--
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: --where the medical students train.
Story_ID: 31228
Speaker 1: Now, I didn't ask you about Molly Thorburn.
Speaker 2: Well, that, I trained with Molly Thorburn.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was the, she was the pathologist who asked Prof. [Professor Ivan] Goodbody for, to recommend someone, and he recommended me.  And that was really where I shot off.  I actually started in her lab in 1967, and actually worked with plants, alkaloids, looked at some of the--I worked along with her, preparing chromosomes, studying the chromosomes of children who were failing to thrive, children that had birth defects to see if there was a chromosomal basis for their condition because that's what she did with her lab.  And then I was doing my project on the side for my Ph--for my master's [degree].  And that project was to look at some of the active principles of certain plants that Jamaicans eat, use normally to see if these plants could be responsible for birth defects in children.  And one of the three plants that I looked at was marijuana (laughter).  There is a lot of canni--cigarette, cannabis smoking there.  And so what I did was to take the--there was a professor over in anatomy who was looking at the effect of marijuana on limb development.  And so he had some of this marijuana concoction that I used, put it on cells that were growing in culture to see if it would affect the chromosomes.  And I was hoping to get some--at that time, there was the psychedelic drugs that were being used.  Remember LSD.
Speaker 1: (No audible response).
Speaker 2: LSD was shown to cause chromosome breaks, and so I was hoping that marijuana was doing the--not hoping that, thinking that marijuana might be, because of its psychotic effects, might also have similar results.  And when I added the marijuana to the cultures, and to the chromosomes, I did not get an increased frequency of breaks or what I really wanted.  But I did notice that the cells failed to divide.  They had a reduced proliferation capacity.  They weren't dividing as they should.  And--
Speaker 1: So marijuana stalled the division of the cells?
Speaker 2: The division of the cells, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I was looking for, I really wanted to find chromosome damage, and that was the goal.  So my advisor said to me, so what are you gonna do with the results?  That is Molly Thornburn.  She said, you have to publish, then get your results.  She said you have to do it because, you know, as a scientist, whether you--that is a result, the failure.  You didn't get what you want.  You didn't get chromosome breaking, but you got stalling of division of the cells.  And that could cause birth defects because if the baby, cells aren't dividing, that could cause defects.  So she said, she said write up a paper.  And she said, I said, I'm gonna put your name on it.  She said, no, don't put my name on it.  Just put your name.  You're the only one who did the work.  You developed the analytic stuff.  And we sent it to the 'Lancet', which is the leading British, leading British journal with a very high impact value.  And the paper was accepted, no corrections, and everything was fine.  It was published.  The paper was entitled, 'Cannabis and Chromosomes'.  And I couldn't believe they accepted the paper at the Lancet.  And I got all these reprint requests to Dr. Patricia Martin, Dr. Patricia Martin, doctor, you know, people writing for requests of the paper.  And two weeks after my paper came out in the Lancet, a paper came from the United States in the same journal with the same title, confirming my results.  And that, Molly said, if you had hesitated, if you had stalled, if you hadn't done this promptly, you would be confirming their results.  And that was such a, that was such a--that's when I took off because I thought, ghee, a little island like Jamaica was the first one to publish this thing?  And this paper from Connecticut from the University of somewhere published, and they had to quote my, cite me, cite me, you know, my first citation two weeks after I published it.  And they were getting the same effect that I had.  And they have the same hypothesis that I had.  They thought that they would have had chromosome breaks, as I did.  And so that lesson, I've said it over and over again because it really was the thing that got me hooked on science and made me know that I shouldn't have gone to medical school.  That's what I should be doing (laughter).
Speaker 1: There's so many, you know, it just makes you reflect on so many, I guess, contradictions in the world where, you know, people live in Jamaica think they're less for some reason, and then, but people go there for vacations (laughter).  Everybody wants to go there, but the people that are there don't think it's, you know, don't think they're living in a place that's vibrant or doing anything--
Speaker 2: Um-hum--
Speaker 1: --and then here you produce something, and you don't think it's necessarily worth something that somebody in Connecticut would do--
Speaker 2: Yeah, somebody, yeah, they were, they--and our results confirmed those of Martin.  That's why I have Martin-DeLeon because I had published twelve papers before I got married.  And I couldn't lose those papers, so that's, I just added on DeLeon to it.
Speaker 1: Well, but this is exciting too because it confirms that science is science, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh, yeah.  It was, I keep, I keep thinking, you know, I tell my students that it has been downhill since because the impact factor of the Lancet is much higher than most of the journals in (unclear) (laughter).  It's, so it's been downhill since 1969 (laughter).  So, it's funny, but, no, that was--but Molly allowed me, Molly Thornburn, she didn't--I was a little, I thought that she didn't believe me why she didn't put my name on the paper.  You know, usually when we publish today, the lab, the head of the lab's name is on the back of the paper, and, you know.  But she never put her name on it.  She didn't want her name on it.  She wanted, all by yourself.  I don't, I felt that she probably might have thought that I--I don't know what she thought.  But it was very reassuring when the work was confirmed by another lab.  And so soon after.  And so soon after made me feel that, well, look, you can't delay.  You have to do things promptly.  And that was a lesson that I've learned all throughout my career.
Story_ID: 31229
Speaker 1: So, just to put it in a blunt fashion here.  If, so your findings would confirm that if a baby was exposed to a lot of marijuana, you know, in whatever form--
Speaker 2: It could stunt the growth.
Speaker 1: Yeah, stunt the baby's growth.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Just like they used to say about cigarettes back in the day, cigarettes stunt your growth.
Speaker 2: Yes, smaller birth weight, yeah, that's it.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It's the same, because--and the mechanism, now what people really want to find out is what is the mechanism by which they do it.  In the case of cigarette smoking, what it does, it prevent placental exchange.  So what happen when, when the mother smokes, the blood vessels constrict, and less blood gets to the fetus.  And blood carries the oxygen, it carries the food.  So you're actually--it's deprivation, oxygen deprivation to the fetus.  So, so it would be, you know, it, it--but, you know, at the time, you know, I wanted to see chromosome breaks.  I was studying chromosomes.  I wasn't studying development, and I kind of wanted to see breaks.  But, but that's also, you know, when you start off with science, you kind of have no--you have tunnel vision.  You know, you're looking at this, but you're not seeing the greater impact.
Speaker 1: All right, because you didn't see what you wanted to see, you didn't value it--
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly.
Speaker 1: --as much.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so this, this really--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I tell my students all the while I did--you have to be open.  When you go to sleep, you have to listen to your results and not just, you know, sometimes, as a young scientist, you just do something, you're looking for something, and you--this is what you're looking for.  And you don't see them and the rest is garbage.  No, you're, there are other things there to see.  And so, you--it was a good lesson.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so this is in nineteen sixty--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Nine.  The paper was published--
Speaker 1: [1969], '69 [1969].
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was the same year I left for, for Canada.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 31230
Speaker 1: So, now, tell us about the University of Western Ontario?  How did you choose that school and where is it in Western Ontario?
Speaker 2: Right.  Western Ontario is in London, Ontario, about two hours from Toronto [Canada].  While I was in the chromosome business--see, you have to remember that 1959 was the first year that we were able to actually visual chromosomes under the microscope, 1959.  And here I am now, 1960s, just about ten years or less than ten years after--chromosomes were big things.  They used to find chromosomes in men who had gone to--the X or Y chromosome in men with criminal tendencies.  Chromosomes were involved in, in failure to reproduce--I mean chromosomes were really big.  So I really wanted to continue studying chromosomes.  And I would look at the journals that I got and the labs that were studying chromosomes, and University of Western Ontario had a man who had studied a whole bunch of fetuses, spontaneous abortions.  He studied the chromosomes in spontaneous abortions, and found that 20 percent of them had one of the X chromosomes missing.  And so, because there was so much on chromosomes, I wanted--I chose University of Western Ontario.  And I chose this guy, Maury--a guy called David Carr.  I wrote to him because I read his paper, and--about the aborteses (ph.).  And then he wrote back and said he was just leaving the University of Western Ontario, and he was going to go to Guelph [University in Guelph, Ontario, Canada] or to McMaster, another--which is another university in Ontario.  But he said that his recent graduate student who just got her Ph.D. would need a grad student, and then I could work with her.  And so I went to work with Evelyn Shaver who was my Ph.D. advisor.
Speaker 1: Okay, Evelyn Shaver, okay.
Speaker 2: Shaver, um-hum.
Speaker 1: That's S-H-A-V-E-R.
Speaker 2: V-E-R, um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, Professor David Carr, I've heard that name before.
Speaker 2: Professor who?
Speaker 1: David Carr.  It seems like I've heard his name before.
Speaker 2: Yeah, David Carr, yeah.
Story_ID: 31231
Speaker 1: So, anyway, so this is Western Ontario [Canada].  You're not too far from Detroit [Michigan] here?
Speaker 2: Not at all, very close by, yeah.  There're a lot of students from that area at the university, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're doing chromosome research--
Speaker 2: Um-hum, right--
Speaker 1: --there at the University of Western Ontario [London, Ontario]?
Speaker 2: --I carried the chromosome things over there and that was like a, attracted me there for having done the chromosomes for the--so my thesis was looking at the effects of not only marijuana--back in Jamaica, not only marijuana, but two other drugs, one of which did break chromosomes.  So I did find one that broke chromosomes.  And so I really wanted to continue working with chromosomes.  And when I went to Western Ontario, I continued to work with chromosomes.
Speaker 1: What were the other two drugs that--
Speaker 2: One of them was called Crotalaria, which is a plant, a bush, a plant that's used, it, to make teas.  And the other plant, you wouldn't believe it or not, was from Ackee, have you heard of Ackees.
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: Ackee is the national fruit of Jamaica, A-C-K-E-E.
Speaker 1: Oh, A-K-C-E--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's the national fruit, but if it's picked unripe, it causes hypoglycemia.  And a lot of, you can have Ackee poisoning with that and also, if a person's nutritional level is not up to scratch, it can cause problems.  We thought it was causing problems with pregnant mothers who were having children.  So--
Speaker 1: Is this the same fruit that they're call now, A-C-A-I, Acai?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no.  No, this is a (unclear).  No, Acai is a berry from the different--
Speaker 1: A berry okay, all right.
Speaker 2: --yeah.  No, this is a very pretty--the interesting thing is the Ackee is used as a fish poison in Africa, and it's the national fruit of Jamaica, national food, of Jamaica.
Speaker 1: It's a fish poison in--
Speaker 2: Fish poisoning 'cause I told you, when the food, when it's not properly mature, it's, it's poisonous, you have Ackee poisoning.
Speaker 1: So they catch the fish by putting this juice in the water or what?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't know how they use it, the fish poison.  They either grind it up or use it, whatever, but it, it's used to--
Speaker 1: And so when the fish, I mean they collect the fish after they die or something?  Is that how they do it?
Speaker 2: I really don't know.  I just know--'cause in Jamaica, it's our, I love Ackees.  In Jamaica, Ackee is the greatest food.  We serve it with salt cod fish.  It looks yellow.  It looks like scrambled eggs.  It's served like as a breakfast meat, or it's even served with rice for dinner.
Speaker 1: But it has to be ripe for, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it has to be fully ripe, open--the pods have to be opened on its own, not forced open.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When people force open the pods--
Speaker 1: They are punished.
Speaker 2: They are punished (laughter).
Speaker 1: I see, okay, and it's A-C-K-E--
Speaker 2: K-E-E, Ackee, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, A-C-A-E-E.
Speaker 2: No, A-C-K-E-E.
Speaker 1: A-C-K-E-E, okay, all right--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: E-E, Ackee.
Speaker 1: --I got it.  All right.  Ackee, all right.
Speaker 2: So those are the three plant.  I use those three plants.  They're different, they use--these are plants that are consumed by Jamaicans, one for recreational, that's marijuana, one for food, Ackee, and then the other, Crotalaria, for teas.
Speaker 1: Now, which one caused--
Speaker 2: Crotalaria caused the breaks, and I--I can't remember if we got breaks, but if we--I know there was no breaks for cannabis.
Story_ID: 31232
Speaker 1: All right, so you were, you continued to study these at [University of Western Ontario, Canada]--
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: No, you didn't, okay.
Speaker 2: --no, I continued to study.  Now, I've shifted my focus to look at chromosomes now, not when they're exposed to plant toxins, but when the sperm might be old because we know that Down Syndrome occurs quite often to older couples.  And they had studied for a long time, older females because they thought older females have older eggs.  And--
Speaker 1: I hate to say it, but do you think it's just a tendency to blame women--
Speaker 2: Well, that was the point.  I wanted to see if older, if--older females also have older husbands.  And therefore, my hypothesis was to study the aging sperm and to see what impact the aging sperm has on the resulting conceptus.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what were your findings?
Speaker 2: I used a rabbit model, and I studied sperm that were aged in the male tract and sperm that were aged in the female tract.  And you can do that quite nicely because you can, the rabbit is a reflex ovulator.  It, the rabbit only ovulates when the male jumps on its back.  That's why they have so many children--they're always guaranteed, whereas humans, we're not reflex ovulators.  We're cyclic, certain, you know, you have a cycle period when there's ovulation.  So in the rabbits, what I did was, I could induce ovulation.  So I could inseminate them artificially with the sperm, the females and then inject them with hormones to induce ovulation after the sperm were sitting in the female tract for a long time.  That was female-tract aging.  Then I also aged them in the male tract, and to age them in the male tract, I did surgery on the male, like vasectomy.  I cut off the supply from the testes and allowed the sperm to age in the lower duct and have them mate at different post-operative periods.  So if I did surgery on the first of the month, and have them mate on the 15th of the month, I know that no fresh sperm would have got into the tract since the surgery.  So those sperm are at least fifteen days old.  And I compared those, the--I took the tiny embryos before they would die and looked, studied the chromosomes to see if there are abnormal chromosomes.  And it turned out that when the sperm were aged in the male tract, there were a variety of chromosome abnormalities, and the ones that were found were more severe than those when they were found, (unclear) aged in the female tract.  So male tract aging is far more detrimental than female tract aging.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so, now, you were the first to discover this?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yes, okay.
Speaker 2: Right, and having worked on the rabbit model, and having worked on six-day blastesis (ph.), we just got the embryo, six-day embryos and we found that abnormal chromosomes.  But we didn't know whether the abnormal chromosome was coming from the sperm or the egg.
Story_ID: 31233
Speaker 1: All right, yeah, we were just commenting about some family lore in my family that, "Old men's children--
Speaker 2: (Unclear) (simultaneous) they walk--
Speaker 1: --walk--
Speaker 2: They walk differently (laughter).
Speaker 1: --walk differently."  But you say there is a, there's an effect on--
Speaker 2: Yes, oh, yeah, we--it's a well documented.  For instance, there's one type of dwarfism called achondroplastic dwarfs.  Dwarfism is usually a dominantly inherited disease.  If a dwarf person has it, there's a 50 percent chance of passing it on to their offspring.  You find parents are totally normal, but they have a dwarf.  And, obviously, this parent didn't--neither parent had the dwarf gene.  But the particular sperm that fertilized the egg to cause that in the offspring with the disease, carried the mutation.  And when they do that, they've concurred with the age of the male.  The older the male, the more likely they're gonna have a mutation.  And certainly, I can understand the results for autism and things like that, the older male, because those sperm--you only make mistakes and errors when the sperm is dividing.  And, you know, men have a lot of sperm.  There are 300 million per male.  And there's a lot of division.  There is a lot of chance for increased mutations and errors, whereas in the female, all of the eggs that a female will ever have are made prenatally, and there's no rapid division.  So there is not the increased chance of bringing mutations because there's no divisions.  Every month, she ovulates one.  She starts making them before birth, and then re--the process stops, and at puberty, it starts up again for one egg when she has a cycle.  So it doesn't have this rapid division that the male sperm--but he has to produce more sperm because sperm has a long place to go and some of them are gonna fall by the wayside.  So you have to have a lot (laughter), some won't get up where it have to go (laughter).  So, that was what my, my focus of my Ph.D. was on, and it was, again, foundational for what I started my faculty work with.
Speaker 1: Now, how was your work received in this--
Speaker 2: It was well received.  I, I had a review article on it, and when I came to the [United] States, I got an NIH [National Institutes of Health] grant to continue the study because what I really wanted to do now was to--at the time when I wrote my thesis, I didn't know what was the source of the extra.  It could have, the males, we know the sperm were old, but we don't know if the chromosome abnormality was in the male contribution or the female contribution.  And at the time, what I said, I hypothesized that because--because at the time, nobody ever thought the sperm could have any problems, right?  It was always the female.  So in keeping with that, my hypothesis was that, because the sperm are old, they are not able to activate the egg in a timely fashion.  So the egg becomes aged, and cause the chromosome abnormalities.  That was what I wrote in my thesis, believe it or not (laughter) because I--there was nothing surrounding--there was no data at the time that would support the idea that a sperm could carry, could have problems.  So I had to, when the aged sperm caused problems, I had to find somehow to say that it was an indirect way because the problem came through the egg, because it--the egg, being an old egg, it wasn't able to--an old sperm, it wasn't able to activate the egg in a timely fashion.  So now, the egg aged, because you remember, we had older women having--so I had to tie to the women.  So when I came to this country, when I started my job as a professor, the first thing I wanted to do--
Speaker 1: Now, we have to get your post-doc--
Speaker 2: Oh, right, sure, yes.
Speaker 1: And then, and just to say, and then to say this too that what you just described is what, I mean you were describing what you discovered then.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But you actually know much more about now.  So--
Speaker 2: Right, okay.
Speaker 1: That you (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --sure, right, okay, right--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: So just to make that point (unclear) (simultaneous) for anybody watching this--
Speaker 2: So it was well received, yeah, it was well received.  It was published in two very good journals, 'The Journal of Fertility and Sterility', 'Journal of Developmental Biology' which is a prestigious journal, seminal, it was called a seminal paper.  It was well received.
Speaker 1: But the onus of this is still on the female in the paper that you wrote because--
Speaker 2: In that paper that I wrote--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, and those were the times (unclear) (simultaneous)-- that that's what people--
Speaker 2: Yeah, in my hypothesis, right, yeah.
Speaker 1: --had never really--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I look back, and if I show my students, there was, [sigh] "Dr. D?" (laughter), wow (laughter).  That is so funny.
Story_ID: 31234
Speaker 1: Okay, this post-doc, this is a, this is a--
Speaker 2: At McGill.
Speaker 1: McGill University [Montreal, Canada], right.
Speaker 2: So I wanted to do something different, not chromosomes.  I wanted to learn molecular biology because at that time, remember there was the genome thing and there was all this molecular stuff.  And I kind of wanted to get into it.  So I wanted to do a post-doc that didn't have anything at all to do with chromosomes.
Speaker 1: This is '72 [1972] through '76 [1976], right?
Speaker 2: '75 [1975].
Speaker 1: '75 [1975], all right.
Speaker 2: Right, '76 [1976], I worked for, as a professor--as a sessional lecturer at McGill [University].  I was at McGill through '76 [1976], but I, the last--three years was research and one year was teaching.
Speaker 1: Okay, got it.  So, okay, so at McGill, now, what did you work on out there?
Speaker 2: Well, I worked in cell biology, worked in growing, culturing cells.  That's when--the first time I ever, began to work with mice, yes, mice embryos--'cause I'd worked with rabbits before for my work.  And mice are closer to humans in that they are not reflex ovulators.  They are spontaneous ovulators.  They cycle just like--not a similar cycle, but, but a cycle like humans do.  So I was getting closer to humans, shifting over to--so I learned a lot to work with mice, and I got embryos.  And I made tissue culture, and I studied, and I--I wasn't as prod--I wasn't as very productive as I could have been.  But I did publish a paper.  The lab was working on, during my post-doc there, but I did learn a lot of molecular techniques and cellular techniques and culture techniques.
Story_ID: 31235
Speaker 1: Now, was your sister [Yvonne Newcombe] in Canada with you at that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, she--because I got there, I, she came up.  Now, see I had a, you know, had my Ph.D. [degree], right, and I was doing my post-doc [postdoctoral traineeship].  And she came up and did her master's [degree] and went to McGill [University, Montreal, Canada], actually was at McGill too, did her Ph.D. there.  And so that's why, you know, we're kind of close because we were--two years apart.  We went to university together.  I caught her up at university, and then when I did my Ph.D., and I was married, and she--well, I invited her.  She stayed within our house, and we, when she came up, and then, you know, so we're, we're pretty close.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She is my god daughter--my godmother for my daughter and, you know, so we--
Speaker 1: That's good.  I guess it could be pretty lonely, you know, being some place without any relatives--
Speaker 2: I know.
Speaker 1: --or anybody that you know?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 31236
Speaker 1: And that's been, you know, like here in the [United] States, when I came, I've, you know, when I went to Canada, I was the only--there's nobody there, and when I went to [University of] Western Ontario.  And, but, you know, that's why I lived in the dorm.  My mom [Louise Martin] said stay in the dorm, you know, where you meet people and not on your own.  So I stayed in the dorm for three years, and I, I was dorm, (unclear), you know, I got my tuition--my boarding paid free staying in the dorm.  So I saved up all my money.  All my, all my student stipend and just went to the bank because I was eating and living free, and I was on, right on campus.  I didn't have a lot of expenditures.  So--.
Speaker 2: Okay, and other people we've interviewed talk about how intense the research is if you're working on a Ph.D.  So you don't have a lot of time anyway (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Yes, that's right.  It was really, it was nice being on campus.  I would go home and eat and go right back to the lab.  And I would work in the lab until ten o'clock, and in those days there was Vietnam War, those discussions, the guys, there were mostly guys there, and they were always talking politics.  So I would just lock my--they wouldn't know I'm there.  I would lock my office to my lab door (laughter).  One day I loaned somebody a book.  She was returning it, and so she opened the door, and there was I, (unclear), said, "You're here?"  (Laughter) But I was hiding from them.  I wanted to get some work done.  (laughter).
Story_ID: 31237
Speaker 1: So you're at McGill [University, Montreal, Canada] for, until--from seventy [1972-1975]--this is pretty good stretch of time.
Speaker 2: Yes, it was a nice post-doctoral period because, you know, even though I didn't publish too much, I only published one paper, but I was publishing some other papers that I had had before.
Speaker 1: Oh, you mentioned kind of, real quick, that you got married.
Speaker 2: Right.  So, no, but I got married, yeah, I got married at the end of my, just before--'71 [1971], 1971, when I got my Ph.D. (unclear).  But I got all my data (laughter).  I was just writing my thesis.  I got married in December around Christmastime, and then I wrote my, got, I wrote the dissertation and graduated in June.
Speaker 1: Okay, was your husband a student too?
Speaker 2: No, he, we went to the same church back in Jamaica.  So when he came up, he went to Sir George William University right in Montreal [Canada] while I was doing my post-doc, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 31238
Speaker 1: So you taught for a year at--
Speaker 2: After McGill [University, Montreal, Canada].
Speaker 1: --McGill after your post-doc [postdoctoral training].  And how did you decide to come to the University of Delaware [Newark, Delaware]?
Speaker 2: Well, I realized that I couldn't stay in Can--in Quebec [Canada] because mostly they wanted you to speak, to teach in English--in French.  And I had tried, I mean one, one, you know, I tried to learn French.  It was one of my goals, or our goals there.  But it, you know, again, it didn't come very easily for me.  It did come easily for my sister when, to my sisters who came afterwards.  It didn't come easily.  And getting a job, the kind of job that I wanted, I realized that I would, I--you know, I had to look in 'Science' magazine.  I wanted a science job.  I wasn't tied to a place.  I was tied to science.  And so I saw an ad [advertisement] for a place called Delaware, and we had bought--our daughter was about two at the time, and we had bought Britannica Encyclopedia for her.  And I went to Britannica and looked up Delaware.  And they say it's a small state that grows peach and mushrooms, and my husband said, I can't get a job there.  I'm an accountant, you know (laughter).  And I said, okay, I'm gonna still apply 'cause the job sounds just like me.  They want somebody to do chromosomes and stuff and stuff like that.  So I applied for the job, and they invited me down for an interview.  I was so surprised I was short-listed, you know, on their short list.  So the guy called me up and said, we would love you to come give a seminar, which is typical, you know, you give a seminar and the interviews (unclear), so you see how you can talk and, you know, stuff like that.  And so he said, now--he had told, I was so excited when he called and said we would like to see you, that I completely forgot the instructions that he gave me.  And so I had to come in February.  It was winter.  And so I called, called the airlines to get a flight to come down, and I--there was an airlines called Eastern Airlines, and I called them.  And they said, there's no Newark, Delaware.  There's only Newark, New Jersey.  And I said, what's--then I called Delta [airlines].  And I said, I have to for an interview in Newark, Delaware.  No, no, no, there's no Newark, Delaware.  There's just Newark, New Jersey.  I said, no, it's in Delaware.  I just spoke to a man from there.  So I had to shamefully call back the man who I spoke to and said, listen, Professor, I would love to come, but how does one get to Delaware.  And he said, as I told you, you have to fly into Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and take a shuttle from Philadelphia because Delaware has no commercial airlines (laughter).  So when I told my husband, he said, I can't get a job there if they don't have any commercial airlines (laughter).  But it was so funny because there's no Newark, Delaware.  I'm beginning to think it's a crank call because how could this man tell me it's a job.  I knew I had applied for the job.  I saw it in Science magazine, and I answered the ad in Science.  I mean I knew it existed, but two airlines, Eastern and Delta.  So then I called back and said I had to go to Philadelphia.  There is a Newark, Delaware, but I can only go there by a shuttle, so I got in and the shuttle drove me.  That's a story I tell everybody (laughter), there's no Newark, Delaware.
Speaker 1: So, how long was it before they told you that you had the job?
Speaker 2: Oh, then they wanted--so I went in February.  Then they wanted my--they liked what they saw, and they wanted me to come down with my husband.  So we came down in March for a second interview.  And then they told me, I think in April, that I got the job.  Then we sold our little house, and by August we were here.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did your, your husband, he was able to find a job here, right (laughter)?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: He wasn't?
Speaker 2: He, not initially.  He wasn't finished his studies.  So he stayed in Montreal [Canada] for just one year.  He had one year left.  He stayed in Montreal and then came down every two weeks, so we bought shares in Delta Airline even though they didn't think Newark, Delaware existed (laughter).  So he came every two weeks, and Eastern [airlines]--it was Eastern we bought shares in at the time.  And it didn't help because they went out of business (laughter).
Story_ID: 31239
Speaker 1: Okay, so at the University of Delaware [Newark, Delaware], you taught Human Heredity and Development, Molecular Cytogenetics--
Speaker 2: That's chromosome study, cytogenetics is chromosome study.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And Molecular Genetics.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you've been here ever since?
Speaker 2: Thirty-seven years, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, what, now, most of your research from what I understand centers around spermatogenesis.
Speaker 2: Spermatogenesis, right, how sperm are formed.  Yeah, so I expanded the work in sperm and how they're formed and how they are impacted by the time they spend in the male tract, how they're, you know, if they stay too long in the male, what can happen, just, you know, and stuff like that, and old sperm.  That's where the old sperm came from, you know.  So I pulled everything in, and, but at the molecular level, what molecules are being attached to them when they stay too long in there or things like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and, okay, so, well, how did the research progress over the years and where--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, it did well.  I, you know, I got a--I got a grant, well, the univer--the first year, the university gave me a UDRF [University of Delaware Research Foundation] Grant, a local, to help young scientists.  And then I applied, in 1980--was it '80 [1980]?  I came in '76 [1976], right, so then my son was born in 1978, and then I got a grant, probably--yeah, he brought me good luck (laughter).  So I got a grant soon, '79 [1979] soon after he was born, and I brought him in a basket (unclear) was writing the grant.  And I got a grant from NI--National Institute of Health, and that grant was really to try to find out, yeah, how sperm genome--the chromosomes in the sperm can impact their fertilizing ability.  And the grant was refunded.  I actually turned down--I wrote, sent it National Science Foundation [NSF] and National Institute of Health and I had to decline it from National--I couldn't get both.  It was the same project.  So I declined it from the NSF [National Science Foundation], but I got it for NIH.  And I've gone on to get more NIH grants after that.
Story_ID: 31240
Speaker 1: So I--one of the interesting things was that you get promoted after five years--six years from assistant professor to associate professor.  And the work went so well that--I mean I didn't start off all with the egg thing.  I started on some new things that were going on, some new stains that were, had just come up in the 1970s for chromosomes.  And I had a grad [graduate] student who was good.  I got some work done there.  And I decided that I was gonna go up for a promotion to associate professor in 1980.  And that was a risk because, I took the risk because of the following.  At the time, there was a political thing, a black professor here who was not promoted and there was this thing, and I was--somebody said to me one day, I think you've gone too low--you've gone below the Mason-Dixon line.  And I began to worry about whether there would be fairness because of this case.  It was in the university paper, and there was a busing.  There was a whole lot of thing, and I--so I knew that there were three other people, two other people who were going up for promotion to associate professor in my department at the same time.  And I know that I had more publications than they had, and I had been here for a much shorter period of time than they had.  And I thought it would be a good time to test the field to see if it would be on merit or whether my pigment would come in because if they had turned me down and didn't turn those guys down, then I would know it was racism because I knew that I had been here for only four years, which was a risk because you should go up after--it was early.  It was early.  I shouldn't have gone up.  But I thought that if I hadn't gone up then, I wouldn't have anybody to compare with and to show whether they were gonna treat me differently.  So I took, I guess my faith had a thing (unclear)--I prayed about it, and I, and I--because I hadn't heard about the grant yet from NIH [National Institutes of Health].  But I thought that I would apply for a promotion and would you believe that in a week or two before the form had to go in, I got the grant from NIH, which meant that you--you have to demonstrate extramural funding.  You can't just have funding from the university.  You have to show that you're paying for your salary because when you get a grant from NIH or NSF, the overhead funds is 53 percent of the grant.  If you get a grant for a million dollars, they get 53 percent overhead.  They're not paying you $53,000 an assistant professor (laughter), or, you know, you know.  So one of the tests is that you bring in extramural funds.  And so I took a leap of faith to apply before I heard about the grant.  And I applied because I really wanted to be compared with my compatriots, even though tenure is not competitive, it doesn't compare, but I wanted to test if they were gonna, if my pigment would play a role.  And these two white men who were going up, I had published more than they had.  And I happened to have known that.  So I went up, and I was, and it worked, I was promoted in 1980--from 1980.  So things have gone well since, and I, you know, I was promoted to full professor since and--.
Story_ID: 31241
Speaker 1: Okay, how long did it take to become full professor after--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, now, here it is.  This is a very tricky treat.  There was no mechanism for me to become a full professor in the department [biological sciences], or the department was kind of moribund and to become a full professor, you have to have a full professor head of your committee.  You have to have above, yeah, okay.  So I had applied to NSF [National Science Foundation] for a grant.  NSF had a grant to help women who were changing their field because I was moving out of the chromosomes and going into the molecular biology area.  And so it was given only to associate professors which I was, what I was at the time.  And so I applied for this grant at NSF and told them that I was, my research was moving into the area of molecular biology, and I would, based on that, I would need, you know, I was gonna take a sabbatical and get training in that area so I could get in that area.  And NSF wrote back and said, "We don't think you qualify for this grant because this grant is given to associate professors, and from your CV [curriculum vita], it looks like you're a full professor.  We don't know what's happening in Delaware, but you don't--we don't think we can give you it because you are already established.  You're a full professor."  So I took the letter to my chairman, and I said, they're not gonna give me the grant because they think I'm already a full professor, and I don't qualify?  And he said, you gotta go up next year, you gotta go up next year (laughter).  So (laughter), he sent me up, and I became a--so it took a long time.  I should have gone up, I should have gone up many years before.  I went up in 1990, ten years.  I could have gone up three or four years earlier.  But, but I know I was doing the work, so I knew it was a call--you know, I was, I wasn't laying back, I was working.  And there was no mechanism for me to go up.  And there was no, also there was--the department, as I said was moribund.  There was a lot of politics in the department.  There was, it wasn't--so that shows you how your career can be stymied if you're in an environment that is not a progressive environment.  But I, you know, I keep thanking NSF for promoting me (laughter).  It was their comment that got me going up.  And so we, in fact, I have the--it turns out that I'm the only person in the history of the department who had an associate professor, chaired the committee for a full professor promotion because there was no full professor in the department who could chair my committee.  So that was--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so the university allowed an associate professor to do it.
Story_ID: 31242
Speaker 1: Now, what is diversity like at University of Delaware [Newark, Delaware], I mean what was it like then and what's it like now?
Speaker 2: Not good (laughter).  I was the first scientist, black woman, well--the first black person to be hired in biology.  And I've since been able to get one other black person to be hired in chemistry and one in physics.  And they were two women.  And we, we now have a--it's not good.  We, and we've been working on it, and we're doing better.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 31243
Speaker 1: Now, let me go back to the research here.  What is, tell us about SPAM1 [Sperm Adhesion Molecule 1]. That's the--
Speaker 2: Right, so my lab was the first lab to show that, you know, we were studying these chromosomes, right, because, you know, that's my roots, chromosomes.  And we found that whenever chromosome 6 in the mouse--because we had already shifted our work to the mouse now.  And the reason we shifted to the mouse was because we could tell whether the abnormal chromosome was coming in from the male or the female because in the mouse, you can actually look at the one-cell egg, where the male chromosomes are separate from the female.  And you can count and see which one has the extra one.  Is it the male or the female?  And it turns out that my hypothesis was wrong, that the extra chromosome that we had were coming directly from the male tract, once we changed our model.  So my hypothesis for my Ph.D. [thesis] was now debunked, and now we do get the chromo--increased chromosome abnormality that I got in the rabbits, but now we could say specifically that it's coming from the male tract.  So we began to look at, to test my hypothesis, I did some chromosome rearrangements and found that chromosome 6 had an unusual behavior.  The sperm that had chromosome 6 missing or in excess copies behaved a little differently in terms of their fertilizing competence.  And so I suspected that a gene in chromosome 6 must be affecting sperma--chromosome function.  And so I started, when I took a sabbatical, I did get--I went to University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and began to learn molecular stuff to find out what chromosome in 6 could be involved and what gene--sorry, on chromosome 6 could be involved.  And while looking for that gene, I found that SPAM1, which stands for 'Sperm Adhesion Molecule 1'--that's what SPAM1 stands for, not something that you eat, Spam (laughter), or not unwanted email (laughter).  And so I started studying SPAM in the mouse.  I was the first person to show that it, if you have a mutation in SPAM--in that gene, it can affect the fertilizing ability and therefore, that gene must be important for normal fertilization.  And then I was the first person to show that SPAM1 is not only made in the testes, but it's made in the epididymis, the ducts through which the sperm travel, and then it's secreted on the sperm, put onto the sperm surface.  And, but I would never have thought of doing that had I not done my sperm aging experiments way back for my Ph.D. because I knew that something was happening to the sperm when they stay in the tract for a long time.  And when they stay in the tract for a long time, they get a lot of this SPAM1 put on them.  And so that's the SPAM1 story.  SPAM is an important protein for sperm function and our lab has been, has done quite a bit of work on it, and was the first to show that it's involved, it is made in the sperm ducts and added to the sperm after they leave the testes.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, and SPAM1 is found in every mammalian species.
Speaker 2: Exactly, so that if--that again tells you it's important.  When you find a protein in all the species, then you know--so we've also gone on to look at SPAM1 in humans and one of my (unclear)--students showed that it was present in human tissue, sperm, human, human duct tissues, yeah.
Story_ID: 31244
Speaker 1: Now, what was the impact of that study, those studies?
Speaker 2: Well, it got me a lot of, you know, I got invited to international meetings to give symposia.  I got asked to write two review articles, and I think it's impacted what I'm doing right now too.  We, we're looking at some other protein so it was very impactful that I actually filed a patent on using that, that protein to add it to sperm that are missing it.  And I have three other patents that are pending now that has to do with SPAM1.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is, you're at Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; on sabbatical] in '93 [1993] and '94 [1994], right?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: That's when you're there.
Story_ID: 31245
Speaker 1: All right, so you're at Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] as a visiting professor in '93 [1993], '94 [1994].  Now, what did you, what was the importance of that?
Speaker 2: That was to get me doing the molecular work to find genes because it was important for my transition from studying chromosomes to genes.  Genes are found on the chromosomes, and different tools are used for that.  So that was important for giving me the tools that I now use molecularly.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what happened in 1995?  You came back in '95 [1995], right, to--
Speaker 2: I came, I spent a year.  I came back '94 [1994].
Speaker 1: Right, '93 [1993], '94 [1994], you were there a year.
Speaker 2: Yeah, there for a year, right.
Speaker 1: So, what did you do in '94 [1994]--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, when I got back now, I started to apply the new techniques that I learned there.  And I had my first student who was doing Ph.D.s in genetic--in gene, in gene work 'cause all of my graduate students before had studied chromosomes.  And I had two graduate students who did molecular work on SPAM1, and got me into, as a molecular biologist.  So I kind of, gone from a cytogenetics for the chromosomes to molecular biology now.  So, and simply, to not be limited by my tools, but be focusing on a particular cell, the sperm cell and using whatever tools that I can use to understand it.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is really applied science and--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --in the fullest sense.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 31246
Speaker 1: So in 1996, now what did you do--you were nominated for the Howard Hughes Medical Investigative Award.
Speaker 2: Right, so--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --my productivity, the Howard Hughes wanted to, has this award that they gave to universities.  And they, in the College of Arts and Science, they looked for faculty who were, that were productive or doing a lot of research.  And so they nominated me for that.  And I didn't get it (laughter), but I (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: The fact that you were nominated--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --I'm sure very few are nominated.
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, it's, it's not a--
Speaker 1: So who would you consider to be the leader, I guess in the field of molecular biology in those days?  Who was the leader?
Speaker 2: Well, molecular biology became a tool that you could use in different disciplines.  You could use in your, if you're studying neuroscience.  You would use it if you're studying developmental biology or embryology or cardiovascular or, so it really depends--so it--molecular biology is just a tool really.  So it became something that you, the techniques that, a bunch of techniques that you would use in your particular discipline.  So to ask who would be a leader in my discipline of andrology, which is male reproduction or male health, I would say people--they were all scattered.  I mean I--really, there was, when I was studying SPAM 1, there was no one else studying SPAM 1 to the extent that I was doing it, other than a group in Japan.  There was a group in Japan that, that first me, that, that was--but I was pretty well doing SPAM 1 work all by myself.
Speaker 1: And so you were the leader in that area?
Speaker 2: Right, for the time, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay, that's andrology, huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah, andrology, yeah, that's what discipline it is.  Andrology is the study of male reproductive health, male health, yeah.  So that's what I, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 31247
Speaker 1: How were your findings in those days affecting the medical profession?
Speaker 2: Well, what I've been trying to do since then is really to try to come up with way to help couples who are infertile.  People who work in, with sperm, and I do, have two applications.  Either they come up with a contraceptive to prevent sperm from fertilizing or they come up to help couples who have problem conceiving.  And I choose to do the latter.  And so the goal of the pattern was to be able to add this protein that's missing in some cases to the sperm and empower them to do the job.  What I perceive for the rest of my career is trying to still help these couples.  One of the ways that we do help them now is to, is to doing invitro fertilization where they--and particularly, a technique called ICSI [Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection] where they inject the sperm directly into the egg.  And I'm very much against that because I think that when you take a syringe and inject the sperm into an egg, you bypass all the natural barriers that nature has put there that form a selective mechanism to weed out the bad ones and only let the good ones go in.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And children are being born, autism, as you mentioned.  Children are being born with, by this method with a lot of problems.  And so my goal, or what I expect my work to impact the field, is to be able to take sperm that are not functioning well and treat them in a dish so that they can respond to the treatment and then let them fertilize the egg on their own, rather than using the injection.  And that's what we're, we're kind of working on because now we've shifted to work, working on some molecules that are important for sperm motility.  And sperm motility is the most--reduced motility is one of the primary causes of male infertility.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's how it moves, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, exactly.  If they can't move, they can't get anywhere.  It doesn't matter how many are produced if they can't go to where the egg is.  They've got to travel a long way to where the egg is in the oviduct. And if they can't go there, they can't fertilize.  So I've been working on trying to empower them to be able to be motile and to get to where they need to go to impact fertilization.
Speaker 1: Okay, so those that aren't motile, there's something missing that's--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right, they're missing--
Speaker 1: --that may be an enzyme or--(unclear), (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --they're an enzyme, right.  They're missing a plasma membrane.  The particular enzyme that they're missing (unclear) I work with, is called PMCA, P-M-C-A-4, Plasma Membrane Calcium ATPase, and that enzyme, if--we know it is because in mice, if you knock out that enzyme, all of the males are sterile.  So from that mouse model, we know that--and the male, the protein is found in humans.  We know that there are humans who have that protein not working, and now we're working on a way to add that protein to the surface because we think we are understanding how the protein is added to the surface.  And we think that way will help us to get it there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 31248
Speaker 1: Now, you were also assistant, I mean visiting professor at Penn [Pennsylvania] State [University] at one point?
Speaker 2: Right, well, I didn't--I was visiting professor at--
Speaker 1: At the Hershey [Pennsylvania] campus, is that true?
Speaker 2: Right, I didn't physically go there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I worked along with a professor there, and they--he got the appointment for me there.  But I was at Johns Hopkins [University, Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I did spend some time at Johns Hopkins.
Speaker 1: When was Johns Hopkins?
Speaker 2: Johns Hopkins was '83 [1983] to '84 [1984].
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, that's right.  That's way before--yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: Johns Hopkins, okay.
Speaker 2: But Hershey, I collaborated with a colleague there, published with him and was given the title there.  I needed that title because in order to get the Howard Hughes Medical Award, I had to be associated with a medical school.  And so they gave me the appointment there in order to, for my nomination for the Howard Hughes to go through.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: In '99 [1999], now, I don't know if this is the most important one, but we have one cited here [Zheng, Y. and Martin-Deleon, P. A. (1999), 'Characterization of the genomic structure of the murine Spam1 gene and its promoter: Evidence for transcriptional regulation by a cAMP-responsive element'] along with a Professor Zheng, Z-H-E-N-G--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right, she was a post-doc [postdoctoral researcher], yeah.  She hired as a post-doc in my lab, and she--no, is it Z-H-E or Z-H-A?
Speaker 1: Z-H-E-G.
Speaker 2: E-N-G?
Speaker 1: Yeah, E-N-G.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was one of the best graduate students I've ever had.  She did some very seminal work that got out, yeah.  She, she--just after I got back from Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; on sabbatical], 1995, and she graduated in '99 [1999], and a lot of her work showed, got a lot of citation, I think.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you continue to publish--throughout your career, thus far, you've published lots of papers.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And we have a lot of examples here of--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So every step of the way, you're publishing your findings and--
Speaker 2: Right, right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, is there a particular journal that publishes your work the most or--
Speaker 2: Well, within the last few, it goes, it's cyclical, you know, within the last few years, "Biology for Production", "Biology for Production" which is the premier journal in reproductive biology.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's the number one journal in reproductive biology.  And that's, I've probably published in that one quite often and 'Journal of Andrology', I'm publishing in that too.
Story_ID: 31250
Speaker 1: 2003, you became the chair of WiSE [Women in Science and Engineering program].  Now, is that the national chairperson of WiSE?
Speaker 2: This is the University of Delaware [Newark, Delaware].
Speaker 1: It's local--University of Delaware?
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: And tell us--
Speaker 2: Women in Science and Engineering, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's Women in Science and Engineering--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a move to try to get more women in science and to really try to, to look at the statistic, look at the data, try to make the environment here a lot more friendly so that more--and I was--and trying to help recruit women here.  And also to pay some attention to a graduate students, the female graduate students, encourage them to get into the teaching profession because we realized we needed a lot more role models.  So I was chair of WiSE, and I--
Speaker 1: Is it just the local--
Speaker 2: Local, yeah.
Speaker 1: --organization?  Is WiSE a bigger group or just, is it a local chapter--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: They have a--no, WISE was, they have a bigger--a chapter for engineering which is a national group.  But we, which it's called, Women in Science and Engineering.  Women in Science and Engineering is not a national group, but women--but there's a women's engineering group that's a national.  That (unclear), but we wanted the scientists to be involved.  So we had our own local group on that.
Speaker 1: All right, all right, and this group exists to encourage women in science?
Speaker 2: Yeah, make--yeah, help women, help them get tenure, help them with, you know, adjusting to life and shuffling, you know, home and, you know, things like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 31251
Speaker 1: It seems like there's another track of your studies that centers around something called JAM.
Speaker 2: Right, I just started that, yeah, JAM-A [Junctional Adhesion Molecule A], yeah, we're doing, right.  So we now, a colleague of mine who works in cardiovascular disease knocked out the JAM 1 gene.  And--JAM-A gene, sorry.  And that's one of the ways you study genes.  You knock them out, and see how the animal survives without it.  So, you know, if it's important--if it's important then, things aren't gonna go normally.  And if they, if it's not important, then the animals behave just normally.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's how you, you know.
Speaker 1: Essentially turn off the gene.
Speaker 2: You turn off the gene.  You knock it--right.  So he had done that for his cardiovas--'cause JAM stands for Junctional Additional Molecule-A, and it's found at the tight junctions of blood vessel cells.  And so he knocked it out to study blood vessel cells and when he knocked it out, he found that the males weren't mating very well.  So he asked me to look at them.  And I looked at their sperm and found that their sperm were not very motile and began to ask why weren't the sperm motile and reported that in a very good journal, 'Journal of Developmental Biology' and kept asking people, you know--the numbers are normal.  They, under the microscope, light microscope, they look normal.  But when we look under the electron microscope, we saw some, detected some abnormalities that gave us a suspicion that they might have problems with calcium overload, that they weren't pumping calcium out normally.  And that was what led us into the PMCA molecule because PMCA molecule is a major calcium efflux pump.
Speaker 1: So this is, I don't know.  I'm operating--I'm not a molecular biologist, but operating on the, on the macro level here--
Speaker 2: Macro, um-hum.
Speaker 1: --if you, if your body doesn't get rid of calcium, you joints--
Speaker 2: In trouble.  (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: --(unclear) right, your knee--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --you're in bad trouble, right.  It's toxicity, oh, yes.  Calcium, calcium is very important, is required for functioning, but too little or too much.  So you have to have a homeostasis , calcium homeostasis.  And calcium homeostasis depends on influx and efflux, how much you pump in and you pump out.  And there are certain times you need a high level of calcium, so you gotta pump it in.  But then you've got to bring it back to resting levels.  And if you can't bring it back--
Speaker 1: You've got to keep the balance--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --to resting level, right, you're in trouble.  So that they weren't getting back their calcium to resting levels.  And so I found out that this JAM-A protein has a common interacting partner with the calcium pump, the efflux pump.  So that's opened a whole new area of research.  I mean now that's most recent area of research.
Story_ID: 31252
Speaker 1: 2007--now, this is exciting.  Once again, tell me if I'm, you know, if we need to--we don't want to get to 2007 yet (laughter), but in 2007, you received the National Science Foundation (NSF) Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, Engineering and Mentoring, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Well, this is one of the highest awards for mentoring that's given in the country.  It's a very pres--they give nine or ten each year, and it's given to an institution or to an individual.  So you can get it in an institution or individual.  And I was nominated by the dean of the College of Arts and Science in 19--in 2007, sorry (laughter).  And they, I didn't get the award until 2010 because [President George W.] Bush, I went through three FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] clearance.  We had to go to the White House to receive the award.  It was really very nice.  It was very special.  They had us in Washington for fourteen days--for four days.  And we had to White House--do FBI clearance and all that.  And we did it, for FBI clearance in 2008, and then Bush, under the Bush regime.  And then after six months, it's expired.  It's no good.  You have to do it over again.  And when President [Barack] Obama came in, we did it again, FBI clearance.  And it was about to expire again when he--then I realized how hard the president works because when we went to the White House, we were staying in that room there, and he was, just like a fishbowl.  Of course, everybody's photographing him and, but he's from one office to the other and one (unclear).  So he used it to announce, a ceremony in which we were given the award, was used to announce his program called 'Educate to Innovate'.
Speaker 1: Now, this is President--
Speaker 2: President Obama, now.
Speaker 1: Obama, now, okay.
Speaker 2: And we got it--I got it from Obama.  So I got it in 2010.
Speaker 1: That's 20--yeah, okay, that's three years.
Speaker 2: The 2007 award, yeah.
Speaker 1: The 2007 award was from President Bush, right?
Speaker 2: It was given under his regime, but it wasn't received until 2010.  It's one award.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, it's one award, okay.
Speaker 2: It's one award.
Speaker 1: So you didn't, okay, I see.
Speaker 2: Right.  I went through the process for getting it in 2007, and so when we got our awards at the White House, all of the things in which they gave it to us had 2007 written on it, even though it was 2010.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so were you impressed with the President?  I know you didn't see him long?
Speaker 2: Extremely, and I was, you know, I--did you see a picture of--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay, I sat in that--I fought to get that front seat because I wanted to talk to him.  And I, and I planned everything, and when he came and shook my hand, I completely, I got so nervous (laughter), I forgot everything I was gonna say 'cause he--I'm a big fan of him.  I work hard for him, and, you know, and I, and I muffed it. I just said, oh, thank, you know, I was just so overwhelmed in all of that, you know, when I shook his hand, I, you know, I said, 'cause I wanted to say, oh, you know, I had planned this little thing to say.  And then when my time came--and, of course, he's rushing on, you know, he has to go to everybody.  And it was, but it was a wonderful experience.  And it was very, for me, I was lucky because what happened, after he came to the Green Room, and he met us and photographed with us, the Marshal came up and said, one of you will follow me up front.  And I'm wondering who's this one of me.  So, we all had different--there were nine of us.  We all had different, no, I think there were--there were nine of us there, but there were other people in the group, officials from NSF and so on were there, I think.  But he said, one of you.  And we have different backgrounds.  There were some people, there was a guy who worked in the Indian reserve that had Indians--we had different reasons why we got it.  And my reason was just doing my job okay, right.  But some people had real creative things that they were doing, you know.  One woman picked up kids off a Chicago [Illinois] street who had failed, who had dropped out of school and teach them science.  That to me is really, really (unclear) fun, nice, creative work.  So I'm thinking that, who's that one person gonna be, you know?  It's probably gonna be, be Gabrielle 'cause her program is, you know, I was so impressed with her picking up kids who were failing and (unclear) that in science, to me is wonderful.  Or there's the guy who worked on the Indian reserve, and then we're all waiting to go.  Then he comes up and says, Professor DeLon [loud and drawn out] (laughter).  And I said Professor DeLon?  That sounds pretty close to DeLeon (laughter).  But the reason they called me was because of the Vice President, [Joe] Biden.
Speaker 1: From Delaware.
Speaker 2: From Delaware.  And they had me go sit beside the Vice President, so I was, I got a special treat, which I didn't deserve just to be from Delaware.  The state doesn't exist (laughter).
Speaker 1: Had you ever met him before?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, I met him before.  I had actually, you know, oh, yeah, he--because I served on the Board of Trustees at the university, and he has come to board meetings.  And plus, also, I inspired, I taught his friend's daughter, Amy, Amy Lewis, who  went on to get her Ph.D. [degree] in chemistry--in genetics after she, after I taught her.  And he would always say to me, Oh, my friend, Amy, you know, Amy--so I kind of knew him.  And so then he took me to his office after the ceremony, and we took lots of pictures with the Vice President.  It was very nice.
Story_ID: 31253
Speaker 1: I know that in 2009 there's an article about you in the Jamaican Gleaner ['The Gleaner'; Jamaican newspaper].  Now--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --did you go, you went back for a reunion--
Speaker 2: I went in 2010.
Speaker 1: --of the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, as a result of that, they made me a distinguished alumni.  I went back for a ceremony in 2010.
Speaker 1: That's of the Excelsior [School]?
Speaker 2: No, not the Excelsior.  (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Or the University of West Indies?
Speaker 2: University of the West Indies.
Speaker 1: University of West Indies.
Speaker 2: Yeah, University of West Indies.  I mean I was shocked because the people who got that are people who are Rhodes Scholars, I mean--as, going there as a student, the ones who--I was the, I'm the second woman in the entire history to have had that.  And the people who've had it were, you know, in my estimation, I shouldn't be in that group (laughter).  They were really tough, I mean I was shocked when I, when they, you know.
Speaker 1: Well, you apparently belong.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  I don't know.  But that was a very nice experience to go back to my alumni, yeah, to my alma mater, gave a keynote address there, and they, there were several articles that--the HistoryMakers, the institute [National Institute of Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology], I didn't mention.  This is something that I did again at my--when I was at the Excelsior.  I would go to the institute to study on a Saturday.  And they called me up because they were making recordings of scientists who are Jamaicans, and they, it was interesting that they called, got in touch with me--with an email, today you can get in touch with people very easily, and over the Internet.  They wanted to, for the recordings of Jamaica, they wanted to put something--
Speaker 1: An oral history sort of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they wanted, yeah.  So, that was at the institute.  And then from that also arose the, the Caribbean career thing.  And a number of things came from that.  I was in Trinidad last August to talk to a bunch of young high school kids in science and that, again, I think came from that, the Presidential Award.  I mean I think the Presidential Award was really pivotal because it got (unclear) Caribbean work, you know--even my alma mater from, even [University of] Western Ontario [Canada] got in touch.  The only person who, I guess, didn't get in touch with me is McGill [University, Montreal, Canada] because I was there as a post-doc, and I think the guy I worked with died, and, you know.  But the Presidential Award was really a very--well, it is, it--to tell the truth, it's also gratifying for the students to see how many students are doing so well.
Story_ID: 31254
Speaker 1: And I did get a good bunch of kids of Delaware here.  People who came to work in my lab are bright students, and they were good, and--
Speaker 2: Now, you cited Zheng, you know, but are there others you can name?
Speaker 1: Oh, the undergraduates, oh, yes.  She's now got her Ph.D. [degree] from [University of California] Berkeley, Roshni Kasaad (ph.).  She was an undergraduate.  And she's now working at Tech Bridge, which is a company that inspires girls to go into science.  And she writes that she's doing exactly what was done to her by Dr. DeLeon.  She, the reason I mention that is that she just recently wrote a letter and she was one of the students who did the Human Heredity, the non-major course.  She was an English major in [University of] Delaware [Newark, Delaware], and English majors have to do a non-major science course in this liberal education that you get here.  And so she came in to do this non-major human heredity course, and fell in love with genetics, and shifted her major to biology and then came to work in my lab.  And then I encouraged her to go on and she went on to get her Ph.D.  And so she doesn't like the bench, but she's trying to--she's inspiring, working on inspiring young women to get in science.  So, but she's just one.  I have many others.  There's one, (unclear) my undergraduate student came one day, and she--I saw her crying in the hallway.  And she was crying because she had got in touch with her advisor, and he told her that she, she couldn't get into graduate school with a 3.3 GPA.  And I told her, well, why don't you come to work in my lab.  And today, she's a prof--head of the biology department at Elizabethtown College [Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania].  And I can give you another student again who came in.  None of her parents went to college.  She came and I saw for the first time her chromosomes.  She said that the first--I do a course in which they take their own blood and actually look at their own chromosomes.  And she said the first time she saw a chromosome in the microscope, she could, she just couldn't believe.  And she decided she wanted to do something, medical science.  And so today, she has a Ph.D., and she said that she attributed it to the fact that she had done the course.  So, I mean there are--I've, my impact is far more on undergraduate than in graduate students because I've only had a few graduate, you know, fifteen or so graduate students.  But I've had over a hundred undergraduate students, and I impact them not only in my lab but also in the classrooms, and not only in the major, but in the non-major.  And some of them work for me, but I have a current--in Chicago [Illinois], I don't know if you know, his name is Judge, is it Judge Tailor, Judge Sanjay Tailor [ph.], a Cook County judge.  He came--he's one of my referees.  He came to work and did my course, came to work in my lab, and I tried to make him a scientist, and he was embarrassed when he had to come to tell me that he was gonna go to law school.  And I said, don't worry.  You have to do what you have to do.  So when he went to Loyola, Loyola Law School in Chicago--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yes.
Speaker 1: --he sent me a case, a well-known case by, I forget the name of the case in law school, but the case that discussed some of the principles we had discussed in our human heredity class, human genetics class--
Speaker 2: Right, right.  Genetic, I know in Illinois, Illinois was a pioneer in using genetic information to determine whether a person committed a crime or--
Speaker 1: Crime, oh, yeah, forensics.
Speaker 2: Yeah, forensics, yeah.
Speaker 1: So he sent me--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That was the first state to do it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, so I've had, my impact has been greater on, at the undergraduate level.  He had done my course, and then he had worked in my lab as well.  And I have a lot of people who I have mentored.  I have one very, very interesting story.  And I, and that has to do with a student who came to wash dishes in my lab.  Now, we have--I don't know if it's PAL PELL grants--we have students who come in and they can get work study here to help them go through college.  And I hired, we hired, I always have need for people washing dishes or stuff.  And so I hired this--her name is Angela Clem.  She came in the lab and nice, nice student.  And she worked for me, and then we--I asked her what she wanted to do.  Well, she wanted to go to medical school.  Now, her father had left her mother and gone away.  She and--her grandmother brought her up mostly.  Her mother was a hair dresser, and she went--so she was coming toward her senior year.  And I said, what are you gonna do, Angela, when you graduate?  I mean if you wanna go to medical school, you start.  You don't wait for your, you know, you, early on.  So I said, right, she realized by that time she wasn't ready to go to medical school because she hadn't done the MCATs [Medical College Admission Test], all the various things that you have, preparatory thing.  So while she was in the lab, I said, well, why don't you buy a lab book, and I'll have them teach you to do some techniques 'cause you're pretty good at the, you know, and the things she was helping me with graphs and tables and things like that.  And so when she graduated, I--since I had a connection with Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], I spent a year at Penn as a sabbatical, I said, I've (unclear), you know, if any job for you in the lab, I can get you a job, try to help you get a job.  So she applied for lab jobs and at the end of May when the year ended, she, I said, if you're gonna go for interview, we have to go through this, you know, pre-interview before you go (laugher) because you've gotta know.  They're gonna ask you about measurements, weights, solutions.  So I went through with her a little thing.  She went and she got the job.  Well, I hadn't seen her or anything until about four, eight years after.  I went to my mailbox one day and in my mailbox, there was this big journal from the 'Nature'.  'Nature' is the leading scientific journal.  And I got this so, and I don't subscribe to Nature.  I subscribe to more specialized journals, 'Andrology and Reproduction Biology' and so on.  And I opened this 'Nature', and there was this letter in there from Angela.  She had published a paper in 'Nature' and she had sent me the entire journal (laughter).  And so that was such a--she had gone on from the job.  Today she coordinates the breast cancer research at Penn.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: From dishwasher to research coordinator.
Story_ID: 31255
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what percentage of your time, I guess, what proportion of your time do you spend teaching versus doing research?
Speaker 2: Right, usually--
Speaker 1: And is that satisfactory to you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, usually 25 percent research--teaching, and 65 research and 10 percent service.  And sometimes, I mean that's what I give, but I do, you know, but 75 percent, I'm a researcher.  I'm a, you know, I've, I teach more than 25 percent.  I teach one course each semester which is more than 25 percent.  But that's from the old school, and I just continue--in the school, it's a little different, and some people buy out their teaching time, but I just continue to do what I used to do from a long time ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 31256
Speaker 1: So in 2009, they made you the Trustees Distinguished Professor of Biological Sciences.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: And what is the significance of that?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's an endowed chair.  It's money that's put up for special, and it's the only one in the department.  So it is given to the best of the best (laughter).  You have to be a full professor first.  So you have to reach the top rank, that's full professor, full associate assistant.  And then, among that, you, they--some of the professor--Delaware has a lot of name professors that are sponsored by, you know, like in engineering, DuPont and places like that.  But this one is sponsored by the trustees.  They put up a million dollars and what they do--in my case, it's not--they put up a million dollars.  And then they get the interest on it, and they give you that interests.  So in my case, they took a million dollars.  The split it in three, 33--330,000 each, and then when interest rate was good, you'd get, you know, 30 per--you'd get like $30,000 which would help you with your research.  So, but now, the amount of money for my research is very, I get from that is just nominal.  It's just like a symbolic.  But you get an increase in rank, increase in salary, which is permanent.  So it's--it's a distinguished.  It's a, it means that you've--you cannot get without you, without having national impact.  You have to be a national--an international, I'm sorry.  You have to have international--people from all over the world writing how your science has been impactful.  It's based on, mostly on your research.  It helps if you do, if you are a good mentor too.  Yeah, mentor, mostly research.  And your publications and the impact you have in the world.
Story_ID: 31257
Speaker 1: What's your major source of funding for your work?  Is it the NIH [National Institutes of Health]?
Speaker 2: NIH.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: National Institutes of Health, because it's related, you know, I'm looking to try to find ways of making males, males who are not fertile, be able to.  So it's a health issue that I--
Speaker 1: So have any of the techniques that, I mean the finding, your findings been used to formulate drugs that are or treatments--
Speaker 2: Well, no, not--no, we are still in the stage.  We've got the patent.  We were just about ready to have--a company was interested in buying, in bringing it to market.  It didn't, it fell through.  It didn't come through, but we, we have some more, we have three patents that are pending.  We're hoping that they'll come through soon, and that could make a difference in what we're doing right now.  But nothing, the patent is a first step.  And so we have a first-step thing, but as to actual--and they take a long time to go to the FDA and, you know, it's a--I don't know if my career, I'll be around still by it.  But I mean, my other students will pick it up and carry it if I retire before it gets to fruition.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so would one be like this protein to turn on the--
Speaker 2: SPAM 1, right.
Speaker 1: SPAM 1.
Speaker 2: To add, what we're doing is we're finding out that, that a lot of the proteins that are important in fertilization are membrane proteins because they're in the membranes of the cell because the sperm has very little cytoplasm, has a nucleus and just membrane.  And as those sperm travel through the ducts, the fluid that with which they intimately interact has some of these important proteins in it.  So what we're thinking is that if a male is missing the gene for that protein, we could take the sperm and add the protein into it, just as though the protein gets added to the sperm in the ducts and empower those sperm and help those males.  Plus, we also are interested in diagnosing the cause of male infertility because, it's not just one gene that can go wrong.  We have 40,000 genes in our bodies.  And there's a number of genes that could go wrong, and the way you treat them, you treat them effectively, is to treat them in a way that specifically responds to their specific need, not just one panacea fits all.  So what we're doing will lead to more accurate diagnosis, a finding which gene is abnormal in these individuals.  And, for instance, if you have two little nitric oxide, or too much nitric oxide, you have the same impact on sperm, low motility, too little or too much have the same impact.  Now, if you were just to--it's important to know if you have too little or too much, even though the impact is--because if you have too little, you can add.  Nitric oxide is a soluble.  It's a diffusible gas, and you can add it to the sperm.  If it's too much, you can pull it out of the sperm.  So you need to be able to diagnose whether it's too little or too much.  And our work is leading towards that.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 31258
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back on everything you've done to this point in your career, and you're--you've been here like, well, how many--
Speaker 2: Thirty-seven years.
Speaker 1: Thirty-seven years.  So are you looking towards retirement soon or are you enjoying this (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Actually, you know, my best work has been done since my kids have gone (laughter).  I mean I have, I mean I don't have the restricted time to run home to go to a ball game or do that, you know.  I can carry on.  No, I would like to work, you know, I--what's gonna make me retire is that the (unclear) paucity, the difficulty in getting research funds.  It's gotten very, very hard, and I've been, I've been writing grants back and forth, and it's just been very, very difficult getting research funds.  And that's--I am collaborating with some of my post-docs.  I'm collaborating with a post-doc in China.  I was in Shanghai two years ago, and we, I helped her--we wrote a grant together.  So I co-investigated there, but you don't get enough money, I mean the funding here--that's why I was so happy when President Obama won because I know Rom--you know, I thought he would be more--and he is.  I mean from that White House thing, he is for science.  But the Congress just will not get this money through.  So I mean, as I told you, 65 percent of my time is spent in research.  And if I don't have any money to buy research, do the research, then, you know, the rest of the, my, you know, it might--that's a problem.  That would, that's--the research funding is gonna be a big thing about whether I retire or not retire.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, when you look back on everything you've done to this point, again, is there anything that you would do differently if you could or anything you would change?
Speaker 2: I can't come up with anything that I could change.  I don't believe that genetics is a, having genetics--genetics is modern biology.  Having started my career in genetics has been useful because it, it's at the center, and so, you know, I have shifted, you know, I've stayed with sperm.  I've stayed with sperm, I've stayed with sperm cells.  But, you know, I can think more of good things that I did rather than what I would change.  I--what would I do differently?  When I was hired, I was hired to start a genetic counseling program in the state.  But the state was not ready for that.  And I realized that I was driving down to Georgetown, two hours from here to the School for the Mentally Handicapped, where I would go and look, try to see which ones are Down Syndrome or what, you know, get blood and do chromosomes and realized that I would not be able to sustain a research program traveling down there all by myself and all that kind of stuff.  And was (unclear) that I was, I'm an experimentalist, that I can work with models, animals, and so I decided that I was gonna know the genetic state is in a position to establish a genetic counseling program.  And my chairman called me in last month to ask if I would set up the program for the state.  And I said, yes, I would.  So I think that, I'm looking forward to doing that, but I can say that I regretted not being able to do that for which I (unclear) was hired because it has led me to wonderful research.  I mean I've thoroughly enjoyed the joy of discovery.  It's been kind of fun.  And it, it's allowed me to meet students who are smart and will become my friends (laughter), that I don't know if I would meet those kind of--as a professor, you have a, you have a strong--you have a very privileged position because you can impact these students' lives, and they go away, and they--I mean things that I didn't even realize that I did.  You know, the story that they have (unclear), I mean I can't even remember that.  When I went to Chicago, it turned out, my daughter was living in Chicago for a while.  And she actually lived in the same area where this Judge Tailor lived.  And the president of the university went to, goes out to alumni to collect money from alumni.  And he always ask the students, what year were you at Delaware, you know, and they go to the wealthy ones because they give more, you know, and who was your favorite teacher or professor?  And he said, Professor DeLeon.  And the president turned to him and said, Oh, she, she--you know, he said, you know, he said something like, you know, she--you know, I'm not a scientist, but I, she really impacted me, and, you know, and I did work, I did work for her in her lab.  And, you know, and he said, well, she's also on the board of trustees there, and she's really representing the faculty very well on the board of trustees.  So the president came back from Chicago, and opened his pocket and said, "Do you know this name?"  And I said, oh, Sanjay Tailor, oh, he graduated in 1987.  He said, he said he knew you.  I said, oh.  So, the next time I went to Chicago [Illinois]--so he gave me his email address.  So I emailed him, and he said he lived in this place.  I said my daughter lives close by.  So I went to visit my daughter, and he said, you've gotta come over (unclear).  So I went over to his apartment, his house.  And he came out (laughter), and he, after his wife, he said, do you know this pen?  You know this tie?  You gave it to me when you, when I worked for you.  It was a University of Delaware tie, a university of--I said, no, I didn't.  I said, I can't remember it.  He said, yes, you gave it to me after you--and I said, Sanjay, are you sure?  He said, who else would have given it to me?  (laughter) So what I mean is, I gave it as an example of the impact you have on them, and you don't remember.  That's just one small thing, that they were--so it's just, been a fortunate career to have, and I, you know, glad I didn't become a physician (laughter).  And, you know, I would be helping dying patients, but these young people, it's just nice to see them go out and, on their own and do so well.  And a lot of them have done very, very well.
Story_ID: 31259
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think you've addressed this on some level, but we always ask this question, and I'll ask it again, I mean formally.  Today, what would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it is the lives that I've impacted.  I have students who--it's interesting that I, I was--well, I called up, I had reasons to call up a few students.  And I had five of them in the lab one time, and four girls and one guy.  And, you know, we have problems in the lab too.  You know, the guys don't want to wash the dishes.  One guy--I had a graduate student from, from Brazil.  And his culture, that women should do the work.  And that doesn't go in the lab.  If you dirty a dish, you wash it or you do a bottle or stuff.  And so we had little fights, and, you know, little things that I had to settle.  These are the rules.  If you use this thing, you know.  And so I had one year five students, and I usually take at least two together because it's important that they don't believe that they're the newest kid on the block.  They need to have somebody in at their level because we have post-docs and graduates students, and then they kind of feel, it's too high for them.  It's nice to have somebody on their level.  So I had four girls, four females and one male.  And the one male guy who went on to Stanford [University] and did very well, was very bright, and the other girls would giggle every day.  It was just different kind of--they were bright, but, so I, the one who went on to Stanford, I, you know, I was his, it meant--he would send me back things and ask me to help him decide what he wanted to do in labs and rotate and so we kept in touch.  And when he graduated with his Ph.D., he also published his undergraduate research work, which I do try to encourage them to publish their undergraduate research.  So he was a publisher somewhere in--some (unclear) but some do.  And he had asked, he was gonna go into teaching, but the last minute he decided to open up a screening program with two guys from Stanford, one who had done MBA or whatever, and they were gonna do genetic screening across, across the--a big thing they have at--but there was a big article in the "Wall Street Journal" about this genetic screening program that they established.  So I called Tammy Aider (ph.) who was one of the girls in the lab at the time when he was there.  And I said--she's a genetic counselor.  And the reason I called her up was, I always call up a lot of my students who are counselors now to get from them information about the program because I'm gonna help set up this program for the university here.  So I said, have you been in touch with the other people who you were in the lab with them?  She said, you know, there's (unclear) only medical school there.  The person I've been in touch with is Eric Evan.  I said, Eric, but you don't, you guys never talked, you know, you--I said, oh, that's interesting.  Oh, well, you know, she's a genetic counselor and Eric is doing counsel.  So they, they--that was a very interesting.  Why did I start to tell you this--of the impact.  So some of them, in counseling, I also was the faculty who advised students on doing careers in genetic counseling.  So there's a cohort who are counselors.  There's some who are scientists, Ph.D. scientists.  There's some who are, gone into industry.  And it's nice when I go to meetings at places and there's somebody there will say, you gotta come over and have dinner.  And so it's a, but the more important thing is to see them go out in different fields, doing, taking the bad on and doing well.
Story_ID: 31260
Speaker 1: Okay, there's another question we always ask, is, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I'm very worried about the, the preparation that they get for college so that they are not able to go ahead in the STEM field.  In trying to little address this issue, part of the award money that I got from the Presidential Award--they gave you $10,000 or whatever, I think, yeah, I used to open the program for students from vocational schools.  We have in Delaware vocational schools, that they go, they do shop.  These students, they don't--they're not really--they're kind of high schools, but most of these people are headed for doing trade or whatever.  And so, but they can still get into universities.  So I decided that I would, instead of having these girls go to do shop, I would have them come to my lab--most of them are minorities, come to my lab in the afternoons when they go to shop and learn, learn techniques in my lab, see what the scientific field is like at close quarters and hopefully, mentor them and encourage them to get into science.  And I'm pleased to report that the first three students that I did are now enrolled in Delaware's first generation science.  Well, one of them is Hispanic, and the other two are white.  Well, the reason that I was heading for a minorities, for, you know, African Americans.  But the teacher said she could only send me the best in the class because she didn't think that--she sent me the Valedictorian in the best because she thought that it would be difficult for them in the university setting.  So, this is the problem that I'm relating to you is that, if they're not prepared very early, they are almost shunted off, early on.  And I was not able to get the--I wanted to see skin like mine (laughter).  So that is my, the problem is that we have to improve the teaching of science in the, in the early stages.  Now, in Delaware DuPont has done, we have a DuPont company--Delaware is DuPont country.  And there is a program called "FAME", Forum to Advance Minorities in Education, F-A-M-E, FAME.  And they start at sixth grade to get kids involved in math and so on.  And we just need to have more, more kids targeted, and because the earlier you get involved is the more opportunities you have later on.  I, I was so disappointed that I wasn't able to get the first round kids who were black.  I'll get one Hispanic, got a Hispanic, is because the teacher wanted the--I could understand her.  I mean if the gap--she thought that it would be easier for me to work with the Valedictorians and (unclear) of the class (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Unclear) I think it probably would be (laughter).  And--
Speaker 2: So that's a problem.  I think that we need it earlier.  We need, we need them to keep on (unclear) singing that, to see people--we need more models.  We need them to see people doing it, and, you know, I've been to my children's school.  Of course, it's not--those are, it's not minorities there.  But I realized that the earlier kids see these, see these fields, the more familiar and the more they--the more they find it less imposing, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, you know, the thing is--do you have any programs with younger children, you know, I mean--
Speaker 2: Are the--
Speaker 1: --young kids before they, you know, lose interests in mathematics and science?
Speaker 2: Right, not--my daughter, when I was pregnant with my son, volunteered me (laughter) for preschool.  And I went to preschool to give a demonstration about, you know, the microscope there with water, showing all these little animals.  And they were so interested, and I keep going, where did they lose their interests because they're losing it somewhere between--in grade school, you know.
Speaker 1: It also raises a question as to why they don't do that in preschool anyway?
Speaker 2: The--
Speaker 1: Why don't let the kids look through a micro--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, yeah.  You know, I think that, they, you know, they had--but that's something.  It all depends on, you know, that they--from, they had different occupations coming in to talk to the little kids, to tell them, you know, each week, we're policemen or this, so they could see.  But I, and I thought that when I brought my microscope over with the stuff, and the teacher saw how excited they were, that they thought this was something that they would need to do.  But you have to have somebody there who is, on the staff, who can do that, to really push it.  You know, you have to have a, not just a moment when you think about it, but you've gotta have somebody to keep it, keep it going.  So when, so I don't, but I don't know what they do now, probably they do.  I don't know.  But they didn't at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 31261
Speaker 1: Tell us something about your family.  Now, you have children and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I have--my first born is a daughter.  She was born when I was doing the post-doc at McGill.  And my son was born when, two years after I joined the faculty at Delaware.  He was born in 1978.  My daughter went to Princeton [University] and did Anthropology.  We were hoping--I was thinking she was gonna do biology (laughter).  And then she went on to University of Chicago to do her MBA, University of Chicago, they give an AM whatever they call.  They don't have a BA, they call, but she did organizational development, whatever, I think minor.  And now she works at, in human resources.  She's a senior person in the human resources for a Japanese company in San Diego.  My son came to Delaware and did sociology.  He works in, as a legal specialist in QUALCOMM, which is a technology company in San Diego.  They work in communications, QUALCOMM.  And I have a granddaughter (laughter), yeah.  My son, she's the one who has Anastasia, my middle name.  My son's married, and actually, he's divorced now.  So he had a daughter, yeah, so we--that's why I'm going to San Diego tomorrow (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And my husband is an accountant, and we've been married for 41--42 years, 1971, is it 42 or 41?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's, let's see--
Speaker 2: Forty-two.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 42.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 42, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, what about your parents?  Now, did you, I know your father--
Speaker 2: He's alive.  He's, we're going down in July for his 95th birthday.  And he, it was interesting 'cause he, he was so--the university function of the West Indies in 2010, he, he kept walking with the flyer in his pocket.  There was a flyer that had my photo--it had a--you know, they had flyers all over the country of that.  And then there was one with, oh, that one with me in the red dress, he had it (laughter), I was so embarrassed, he had the flyer for the, (unclear) it was in his pocket, just walking into the, this is daughter (laughter).  He was, he had seen many things, but he didn't, you know, I didn't know.  He was really very, very tickled with his--and since I've left, you know, the little school in Port Maria, the little town had, they used this as a fundraising, three times 'cause Excelsior has done it too, the school.  What they do is they call you back, as I've, you know, as a distinguished alumni, and then they have a dinner, and they--thing to raises money.  So they used it in my little town, and I didn't go.  I couldn't go to all that, and so my dad went, and he got the big plaque, and the dinner.  And so he's been to three of them, which was kind of nice for him, yeah.  It's was very nice, yeah.
Speaker 1: So he forgives you for not staying and being involved in the family businesses?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah (laughter), yeah, long time ago, he forgave me.
Speaker 1: Now, what about your mother now?  She wanted you to be a doctor?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: She--
Speaker 2: But she, yeah, she was the one who pushed that.  You know, it was interesting because before--when we were small, she would say, you should be a dispenser, a dispenser.  And she said, if anybody ask you, well, this pharmacist, what they call it in Jamaica, dispenser.  So I said, why?  She said, well, a dispenser is a polished job.  It's a polished, and I thought what does that mean(unclear) a polished job.  So when you get home in the evening, you have your family, you know, calling the--and then as we started to get, you know, a dispenser, one of my sisters became a dispenser.  I have a sister who's a pharmacist (laughter).  And she, but she, she actually came--when I took the faculty position at Delaware [University of Delaware], she actually came to see, came to Delaware.  She was quite ill, but she came.  She wanted to see me set up as a professor here.  And so she had come to the fact that it was a--that it was a good thing that I didn't follow her decision (laughter).  But she, she came to see the department and it was nice.  And she, it was--that was a good trip for her, yeah.  But, you know, she, she liked--she knew that what we were--she would say whatever you do, do well, once she realized.  Then reach for the top, kind of thing, yeah, she would say that.  So she came to grips with the fact that this was what I should do (laughter).  But she--and she was a, she didn't know anything about professors.  She didn't know anything about those jobs.  She knew about a doctor or a dispenser.  So within her framework, she--when we asked her why should I be a dispenser?  It's a polished job.  What does that mean, mom?  Well, you can come home for your family and stuff like that.  So she, within her non--she was doing the best she could.  And, you know, and she, but she knew that we couldn't all be in the business, that we had to do what--so she, she was smart.
Story_ID: 31262
Speaker 1: Well, one of the things, if you ask me what is the service to the university?  You know, you asked about my science and my teaching, but I do, I've done quite a bit of service for the university.  I served on the board of trustees as the only faculty representation for nineteen years and representing the faculty's view to the board which took a lot of my time.  And I also served in an advisory capacity for the government.  I do consulting work for the government, go to NIH [National Institutes of Health] and do a lot of those kind of service things and then local service within the university.  So even though I put 10 percent of my time, I spend a lot more than 10 percent.  But it has to add up to 100 percent.  So because I do 65 percent research and 25 percent teaching, then I, the rest is gonna be just, is service, but it doesn't reflect the amount of service that I do, the percentage.
Speaker 2: Now, one thing I thought of that I didn't ask about was international travel, and because you're an internationally recognized scientist--
Speaker 1: A lot.
Speaker 2: --do you do a lot of traveling?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've been to twenty or so countries.  I've been to (unclear)--we go for national meetings, China, Australia, Singapore, Korea, South Korea, that is, (laughter).  I haven't, the only continent I haven't--South Africa, Europe.  I haven't been to--I've been to South America, but I've, you know, or meetings, travel, Sweden, Jerusalem, all over and all over the United States because our meetings take us there.  One of the things that I was gonna say was, talking about service, I was gonna say something, the--yeah, and I've been to the (unclear).  So, yeah, I (unclear) I, the work--science is an international endeavor.  You know, what you publish here about the human genome impacts the human genome in--so it involves a lot of travel there.
Story_ID: 31263
Speaker 1: Okay, well, the last question is similar to legacy, but a little different.  Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'd like to be remembered as someone who had a passion for science and who impacted lives and who had a strong faith in God.  I think that has been my guiding principle and I--He's guided, I feel that He's guided my life, and I feel that the reason He has is because I've entrusted it to Him.  So that's probably how I'd like to be remembered.
Story_ID: 31264
Speaker 1: That was the first summer at the University of the West Indies.  Well, actually, can I--no, that was not the first summer.  Are you--can I-- We're still recording.
Speaker 2: Yeah, go ahead.
Speaker 1: You're recording?
Speaker 2: Yeah, go ahead.
Speaker 1: Describe the picture.
Speaker 2: Oh, that picture was taken the summer, while I worked at the Agriculture Lab, the Jamaica Agriculture lab on Hope Road.  And I spent the summer in Kingston [Jamaica] where I was working, and I lived in Kingston.  And that's the home in Kingston.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That picture is taken at the induction ceremony at the University of the West Indies.  I'm on the right in the front.  My sister is directly, my sister, Yvonne Newcomb, is directly behind me.  And to my left are classmates--
Speaker 1: Now this is one (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, that's, yes, that is Francina, and she studied Latin, I know, and in front of her is another friend of mine who studied math.  The others are just classmates.  I can't quite remember their names.
Speaker 1: That is my mother [Louise Green Martin] and Yvonne when Yvonne graduated with her master's degree from McGill University [Canada].  My mother came from Jamaica to, for her graduation.  I was already at McGill, doing my post-doc [postdoctoral training] at the time.
Speaker 2: This picture was taken in 1970, and that is with my boyfriend at the time, Winston [DeLeon], who is now my husband of forty-two years.
Speaker 1: This was taking during my master's degree study at the University of the West Indies in the laboratory of Molly Thorburn.  I'm looking through the microscopes at chromosome.  I spent most of my time doing chromosomes in that lab.
Speaker 2: This is another picture taken in the laboratory of Molly Thorburn.  I'm examining a karyotype which is an arrangement of chromosomes that allows us to detect alterations.
Speaker 1: And this goes back at the graduation ceremony for my bachelor's degree, Princess Alice, the chancellor, comes down to the university each year for graduation, and I was just receiving my graduate diploma.
Speaker 2: And this is Princess Alice?
Speaker 1: Princess Alice.
Speaker 2: While I was at the University of Western Ontario [London, Ontario, Canada], I lived in Saugeen-Maitland Hall where I was a proctor, and that was a proctor council.  They're among my other colleagues such as Gwen who's standing, and Kathy who was the chairman of the hall standing beside--I'm standing beside Kathy on the left.  And in front are other colleagues who were also on the Proctor's council.
Speaker 1: These are little tiny ones.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's a family picture taken at Yvonne's wedding.  In the back on the left is my father.  Beside my--
Speaker 1: What's his name?
Speaker 2: Leonard Percival Martin.  Beside Leonard is my sister, Pauline, Pauline, her son, who is now--I can't remember his name right now.  But standing beside Pauline--oh, her son is Paul, Paul, is Pauline's daughter, and standing beside Pauline is my husband, Winston, and then to my right is my sister, Mary, who was bridesmaid.  In front of me is my daughter, Ruth, who was the flower girl at the wedding, and in front of Ruth is Jeffrey, who was the--at the wedding sitting beside Yvonne in the middle, and my mother is to the left on the front row.
Speaker 1: So, this was on our trip, one of our trips to Ocean City, Maryland.  That is Jeffrey, my son, and Alexandra, my granddaughter, along with my husband and me.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Now, that's your wedding there, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's my wedding, right.  That was in 1971.  And those are poinsettias in the back.  You see how tall they, the poinsettias grow in the Caribbean?
Speaker 1: It's amazing.
Speaker 2: They're huge.  They're poinsettias.  So that was in 1971, December 16th.
Speaker 1: When the kids were small, we took, we would always go to Canada for vacation.  That is taken outside of Niagara Falls, Ruthie and Jeffrey, Ruth on the right, Jeffrey on the left.
Speaker 2: On our way from Hawaii, a meeting in Hawaii, I stopped at, stopped in San Diego [California], and there is Alexandra, my granddaughter with Grandma Pat.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Okay, there you go.
