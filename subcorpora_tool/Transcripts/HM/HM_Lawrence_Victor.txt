Speaker 1: Okay, now is there a story behind your name?
Speaker 2: Story behind my name.  I wouldn't know, but it is because I was born around the Victory Day, the Second World War, the Victory Day, May 10th, around that time.  I think it was May 8th that was the Victory Day.  And so my parents decided to call me Victor.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The "Bernard" was really a priest's name.  It was a priest from United Kingdom who was in Ghana, in Ghana, the Gold Coast then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, you know, I also have my African names, which is Nii Amponsah--
Speaker 1: Okay, you have to slow down now--
Speaker 2: Nii, N-I-I--
Speaker 1: N-I-I.
Speaker 2: Nii and the Amponsah, A-M-P-O-N-S-A-H, Nii Amponsah.

Speaker 2: Amponsah.
Speaker 1: --Owaa is from, which one of the cultures in Ghana?
Speaker 2: It's from the Ga tribe, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: From the Ga tribe in Ghana.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and, all right.  So, now, what does the rest of it mean?  I mean we know the born on Thursday, but what does the rest of your Ga name--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, the Nii Amponsah is my clan name, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's a clan name that they name after people in my father's heritage, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, this is a part of the story that I'm gonna ask you about that I think happens in Ghana and other parts of Africa where someone will have--and I think especially in Ghana for some reason.  There's a famous history book called 'African Glory' written by a man named J. C. DeGraft-Johnson.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And I thought he was a white man from Britain until I saw the back of the cover of the book, and he's in Kente robes, and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --he's sitting there.  And I said, well, how does a Ghanaian get a name like J.C. DeGraft-Johnson?  It sounds like an Englishman.  So what is the story?  How did you get your name and how did J.C. DeGraft-Johnson--
Speaker 2: The story comes on to be that when the Portuguese and then the Dutch and then later on the British got into Ghana, I think these--many folks took the names of some of the folks that came over.
Speaker 1: Okay, I mean is it because of religious affiliation or something with the church?
Speaker 2: There could be religious affiliations and business affiliations as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we have the DeGraft-Johnsons you mentioned.  We have the Mills and then we have the Lawrences and Marbelles [ph.] and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And (unclear) I'm told it's just religious affiliations as well as business relationships.
Speaker 1: Now, that's important.  I've never heard it put like that before, business affiliation too.
Speaker 2: That's right.  It's a business affiliation as--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: So is it common then for people to have two sets of names?
Speaker 2: No, it's not common now, you know, but those were the people along the coast, around Cape Coast [Ghana] and Accra [Ghana] area.  And then sometimes it stretches to Keta.  And in Keta, you could have some of the German names as well.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  All right.  Well, that makes sense.  So, all right, and, sir, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was born on May 10th, 1945 in Accra, Ghana.  It used to be called the Gold Coast, and it changed its name from the Gold Coast to Ghana in 1960.
Speaker 1: Okay, so when you were born, it was the Gold Coast, right?
Speaker 2: When I was born, it was the Gold Coast.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And before we had independence from the British.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we had independence in 1956, March 6, 1956.
Speaker 1: That was--yesterday was the anniversary, right?
Speaker 2: Yesterday was the anniversary of Ghana.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, sir, what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: At the moment, I am associate dean of engineering and Batchelor Chair [and] Professor of Engineering, at Stevens Institute of Technology [Hoboken, New Jersey].  Prior to that, I was vice president of advanced communications technology at AT&T Bell Laboratories.
Speaker 1: The famous Bell Labs, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and, sir, what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) One day after Ghana's independence, March 7, 2013.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We are in my office at Stevens Institute of Technology in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --right in my office.
Story_ID: 28182
Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, there are five, lightweight questions we ask as kind of a warm up.  And they only require a short answer.  The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.  And my favorite food is fish in many ways.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I like fish more than anything else, yes.
Speaker 1: All right, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Favorite color is blue.
Speaker 1: Okay, favorite--
Speaker 2: Blue has been my lucky color.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Favorite time of the year would be in the spring around my birthday.  And besides, it comes around Mother's Day too.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Favorite vacation destination, it's changed for me several times.  It used to be in Europe.  It used to be in Africa.  Now, if you ask me what will I--where will I like to go for a vacation, and I will say that I would like to go somewhere in Africa because I want to let my children see other parts of Africa.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the last question, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Many, many phrases and many sayings.  They guide me.  You want me to give you one?
Speaker 1: Well, give me a couple since you have a lot.
Speaker 2: Okay, well, "The heights by which great men will attain and achieve was not attained by sudden flight.  But they, while their companions slept, were toiling upwards in the night."  So this tells me to be working hard every time and not to play around.
Speaker 1: Do you have another one?
Speaker 2: That's one of my phrases.
Speaker 1: Now, where does that come from?
Speaker 2: It is the (unclear)--I think it's Longfellow [Henry Wadsworth Longfellow].  It's one of these poets.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: So there are many other ones that I normally--which, but mainly, it's mainly to guide me and to move me forward in things that I do--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in many ways, yes.
Speaker 1: Now, are these sayings that you learned in school?
Speaker 2: Yes.  They were sayings that we learned in school when we were in--well, you would call it high school.  We call it secondary schools.  They call it high school here, but there, secondary schools.  And they helped us in our achievements to move forward.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 28183
Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family separate from your father's side.  And then we'll put them together.  And can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My mother's--I'm sure you are talking about the maiden name now, yes.  My mother's maiden name is Ellen, E-L-L-E-N, the middle one is Sarku, S-A-R-K-U, and the last name is Nettey, N-E-T-T-E-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in Accra, Ghana, Accra, Gold Coast, I should say.  And she was born on September 10, 1910.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back, first of all, can you trace her side of the family?
Speaker 2: Unfortunately, I could only trace it to her father's side and not her--I could also, but I could trace her grandmother.  I traced her grandmother because she was brought up by her grandmother in many ways.  Her mother died early, and so she really lived with her grandmother.
Speaker 1: Or maybe I should ask you--now, your mother's a Ga [tribe] as well?
Speaker 2: Yes, my mother is a Ga.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us something about the Ga, about the history of the Ga, and--
Speaker 2: The Ga tribe.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes, I think they were a people that came over from the, you know, the--there was a Ga empire, there was a Ghanaian empire somewhere around there, Mali.  And there were people that came there and settled on the coast of Ghana.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's like thousands of miles away, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, they were thousands of miles away.
Speaker 1: From the Niger River and--
Speaker 2: That's right, and then they traveled and then settled there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Ghana Empire, one of the great West African empires--
Speaker 2: Empires.
Speaker 1: --where there was like three in the same region, Ghana, Mali and Songhai.
Speaker 2: That's right.  That was the empire around (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the Gas are descendants of the founders of the Ghana, ancient Ghana Empire?
Speaker 2: That's right, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, I didn't realize that, that that was, you know, a direct link and I--
Speaker 2: Um-hum, yes.
Speaker 1: --[J.C.] DeGraft-Johnson's book ['African Glory'], he hints at that too, but he--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --yeah.  So, okay.  So the Ga is spelled, G-A--
Speaker 2: G-A.
Speaker 1: G-A, just G-A?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: All right, so did they--so the Gas settled in--
Speaker 2: In, around the Accra area.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: That's where they settled, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that would have been, about roughly what time would that have been, do you think?  Ghana was sacked in 1067 by--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --the Almoravids [dynasty], I think.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think that they must have come around the 12-something.
Speaker 1: Um-hum, okay.  So this would be like 1200 A.D.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: And then you know, by the 14-something, the Portuguese and the Europeans had started coming to the coast, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Around 1485, thereabout.  So it's the Portuguese and the Dutch, then the British.
Speaker 1: And they keep coming (laughter), right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All to look for gold when they were the Gold Coast, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now, the Gold Coast, from what I understand, the source for the gold for the Ghana Empire was actually South where Ghana is now, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So the Gas actually went to where the source of the gold was--
Speaker 2: The gold was.
Speaker 1: --when they left the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: They left and then they moved--
Speaker 1: --the empire.
Speaker 2: Yes, they moved.
Speaker 1: 'Cause the empire was big because of the trade of, between the gold and the salt of the Niger River.
Speaker 2: That's right, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, at any rate, well, okay.  So you can go back to your--
Speaker 2: My parents--my grandparents.
Speaker 1: Your grandparents.
Speaker 2: On my mother, yeah.  So my mother's, my mother's grandmother, yeah, she's--she was really the person that really looked after my mother and my mother's siblings.
Speaker 1: And what was your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: Akosua.
Speaker 1: Akosua, and that's A-K-O-S-U-A?
Speaker 2: Yes, Akosua.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And her name is Dodoo, D-O-D-O--
Speaker 1: D-O-D--
Speaker 2: D-O-D-O-O.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And, now, what did your grandparents do for a living?
Speaker 2: My grandparents, you know, strange enough, I wouldn't know.  My grandfather on the mother's side, that is my mother's father, yeah, he was, he was a merchant trader.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hum, yes, a merchant trader.  And the brother was, worked in the--I think he was more, we call it asaforchay (ph.).  Asaforchay means the General.  So he was a general.  The brother--my grandfather's brother was a general, a general in the Ghana tribe.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: So we call it asaforchay.
Speaker 1: --would be like a military of security--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: A security chief, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so was this actually, was this a position he held or was it a job?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a job because it was a position, but it's a job, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, position as a job.  He was.  That's my great uncle, but my father was--my grandfather was a-trader.
Speaker 1: So what was your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: You mean Nettey?  (Unclear) Neen (ph.) Nettey--
Speaker 1: It's--
Speaker 2: Neen Nettey, N-E-T-T-E-Y, and then so he has the same name as the, last name as the middle name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but he was born on a Saturday, so they called him Neen Nettey Kwashi.
Speaker 1: Kwashi--
Speaker 2: Kwashi, yes.
Speaker 1: K-W-A-S-I--
Speaker 2: H-I.
Speaker 1: H-I, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Kwashi.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 28184
Speaker 1: Now, when your mother [Ellen Sarku Nettey] was growing up, did she, was she prepared for an occupation or did she have a chance to go to school or--
Speaker 2: Yes, my mother had a chance to go to school.  And in many case, my mother went to an Anglican mission school.  So she really was very, very close to the sisters and the nuns in the Anglican church, and that's how she was brought up.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She went to a missionary school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The Anglican missionary school.
Speaker 1: All right, did she work when she--
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was a teacher.
Speaker 1: Teacher, okay.  And what did she--did she specialize in any particular subject or did she teach everything?
Speaker 2: No, she did not specialize in any--she was a teacher not in secondary schools, but in the lower schools.  So she didn't specialize in anything.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, now, let's go to your father's side--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: If anything to be English and religion because that's what they were teaching at the lower schools.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, okay, and did she have any stories about growing up that she shared with you, 'cause she grew up during the time of the colonial occupation by the British, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  She, she grew up around that time.  But I think the stories that she really told were stories about the missionaries more so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: About how, what they--how they worked together and the aim, the mission of the missionaries, the school systems they wanted to build and (unclear) classes things about Easter.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She shared a lot of that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, did she talk about how things were different in those days from what they became or--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.  She talked about how things were different and as the generations moved on, as the times changed, they also had to change with time.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us something specific about, you know, how things changed?
Speaker 2: Oh, things changed in the way in which, because initially before independence, your child was really the child of other folks as well.  So they really, it was something like a community.  All the children belonged to all the, all the elderly folks.  So no one would say that this is not my child or this isn't--they both took responsibility to discipline and to train other folks.  But as times changed, it became more of an individualistic society.  So she talks about that as--also.  She talks a lot about that.
Speaker 1: I think it was in the mid-'90s that Hillary Clinton quoted an African American school teacher about it taking a--"It takes a village to raise--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --a child," and it--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, she did that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: So, now everybody knows that now because she said it--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --but African Americans had been saying that a lot.  In fact, we hear that in these interviews all the time.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: "It takes a village," and--
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right.
Speaker 1: --that the neighborhoods where people grew up, everybody helped--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --discipline the children, and very similar.
Speaker 2: Very, very similar to that.
Speaker 1: So when you hear those stories, do you think it's an African carryover from--
Speaker 2: It is an African carryover.  There is no doubt it's an African carryover.
Speaker 1: Okay, a cultural link, I guess.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Story_ID: 28185
Speaker 1: Tell us about your father's side of the family--
Speaker 2: Father's side, yes.
Speaker 1: --can you give us your father's full name first of all?
Speaker 2: My father's name is Nathan, N-A-T-H-A-N. "C" stands for Codjo, C-O-D-J-O.  He was born on a Monday, and then Lawrence, L-A-W-R-E-N-C-E.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's interesting 'cause you usually see Codjo now spelled with a "k," but--
Speaker 2: Yes, but he spelled his with a "C."
Speaker 1: Right, so Codjo, we hear the name Codjo, Kudjo, and they're all about the same name, right?
Speaker 2: That's right, it's all the same name, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: So he spelled his with a "C."
Speaker 1: There's a famous Kudjo in Jamaica that led the rebellion against the British in 1800s, I guess--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --Kodjo, right.
Speaker 2: In fact, you can trace the Jamaicans down to Accra [Ghana].  They have the same cultural things.  There's a part in Jamaica that goes directly to Accra, to Ghana.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and--
Speaker 2: So my father, he was a lawyer.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is his--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And an educationalist.

Speaker 1: I started that down (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Nah, nah, no, 1900.  (unclear)
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: December 17th, 1900.
Story_ID: 28186
Speaker 1: All right, so what can you tell us about your father's side of the family?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, I have a lot to say about my father.  I think my father was educated in the United Kingdom.  So he, after his primary education, secondary, he went to, what, to the United Kingdom, I think.  He went to the United Kingdom in the early '30s [1930s].  He was a little older before he went, with, in the early '30s [1930s].  And then he did his degrees there, and then he, then he went to the bar, (unclear) (simultaneous)--

Speaker 2: London University.
Speaker 1: University of London?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, University of London.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: University of London, King's College, I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, okay, he was, yeah, he became a barrister.  Did he--I'm gonna ask a wild question here.  But did he know [Mohandas Karamchand] Gandhi [the pre-eminent leader of Indian nationalism in British-ruled India. Employing non-violent civil disobedience, Gandhi led India to independence and inspired movements for non-violence, civil rights, and freedom across the world]?  I know Gandhi had a law degree from--
Speaker 2: I, I would not--I'm sure, but I would not know.  That conversation never cropped up, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, I just wondered.  I just wondered if he might have, you know.  But any rate, so he went to the University of--
Speaker 2: I knew the, I knew the Gandhi family, but I will tell you that when we get to my life.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, he went to King's College.  Now, are there any--did he have any stories about growing up?  How did he grow up and get in a position to, you know, go to--
Speaker 2: By hard work, he really grew up by hard work.  And when he went to England to--he went there and he struggled.  He did a lot of menial jobs to be able to get through.  And eventually, he was, not eventually.  He was saved by the--not saved, but eventually, he was helped by the Anglican Church.  And so he became very religious in that, in that light.
Speaker 1: Okay, the Anglican Church is the Church of England.
Speaker 2: Church of England.
Speaker 1: It's--the American--
Speaker 2: Episcopalian.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: They call it Episcopalian here.
Speaker 1: The Americans call it the Episcopalian Church 'cause since we broke away from England, politically, we can't use Anglican anymore (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That's right, Episcopalian.
Speaker 1: That's why they call it Episcopalian here, but the same church exactly.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: And you have it here too.  I think if you go down, you will find that Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey] was really founded by mainly the Episcopalians, and the Rutgers [University, New Brunswick, New Jersey] by mainly the Methodists and the Presbyterians.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: So, now was your father born in--we know he was born in 1900, but was he born in Accra [Ghana]?
Speaker 2: Yes, born in Accra.
Speaker 1: In Accra too, okay.  Now, there's a--do you know the name of the school he went to in Accra?
Speaker 2: I wouldn't know.  It could be Government Boys School or something.
Speaker 1: Okay, because there was a couple of--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --famous--I know we've interviewed some people who are (unclear), and they go to Achimota [School]--
Speaker 2: That's where I went to.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I went to Achimota--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was before (laughter) Achimota--
Speaker 1: Yeah--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --he was before Achimota.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so--
Speaker 2: So I think that he went to England, and he did his O-levels in England, not in--so it was his primary school that after that, went to England.
Speaker 1: Okay, so when your father got his law degree, he came back to Ghana and did he set up practices in--
Speaker 2: He practiced a little bit (unclear), and then he went to--became an educationalist.  In fact, he was really a reformist.  He believed in education, that the children have to be educated.  Ghana has to have education.  And so he became the director of education.  He put his law degree aside and became the director of education.  And he went around the whole of Ghana setting up schools, looking at the standard of the schools, and it was mainly the primary education, mainly it was the few secondary schools--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Now, was this during the--
Speaker 2: Pre-independence.
Speaker 1: Pre-independence, okay.
Speaker 2: Pre-independence.

Speaker 1: Okay, now, did he play a role after independence in the administration Kwami Nkrumah [leader of Ghana and its predecessor state, the Gold Coast, from 1951 to 1966]?
Speaker 2: No, unfortunately, my father died in 1954.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Before independence, unfortunately.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were only about nine years old when--
Speaker 2: Yes, I was nine years old when he died, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: --Only nine years old when he died.
Speaker 1: Do you have any good stories about your father, about his personality or--

Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, he was a very important link between the--yeah.
Speaker 1: So are there any stories from that period of time?  Now, you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was just telling that, I mean they would talk about the slave trade, and they would send, take us to the castles and see the castle and so forth.  Then I also went there fairly recently.  I took my children there, and so you will see the various levels of where the dungeon where the slaves were, and then you will see the door of no return.  You will see it's written, "Door of No Return."  Once you step out, you can't come back in.  And once you step out of the castle right into the boat, and you cannot come back in.  I think Obama [President Barack Obama] also observed that, and the irony of it is that you had all these things down and on top there, there was a church.  So the people that were doing this trading were praying at the same time of doing the bad things under.  So they would say you could see the irony of these things.  And it helps shape your personality.
Speaker 1: Now, I've heard that there are over fifty of these castles down the coast of Ghana.  Is that true?
Speaker 2: No, there are not more--there were only three big ones that they really used.  They used the one in Accra [Ghana], Christiansborg Castle.  They used the one in Cape Coast Castle and in Elmina.  They were the three main ones they used, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so which one would you go (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: They are the--
Speaker 1: --to Christiansborg in Accra?
Speaker 2: No, I was talking about the Cape Coast Castle.
Speaker 1: Cape Coast Castle.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) (simultaneous) castle, yes.
Speaker 1: And so--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I think they all had gates of no return though.
Speaker 1: So what did you think?  How did you feel when you heard those stories for the first time?
Speaker 2: Oh, you feel pitiful when you hear these stories for the first time.  But you've been brought up never, never, never to be (unclear), because these are things that are past and you always look to the future.
Speaker 1: Because the slave trade had been over, I mean it was over in, what, 1830s or so?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, the slave trade was over and then the Emancipation and the John Henry Newman, the priest, that saw the light.  And for the very famous hymn that comes out of these type of things.
Speaker 1: Oh, John Newton, you mean, the--
Speaker 2: Newton, yes.
Speaker 1: --the 'Amazing Grace'.
Speaker 2: And that's Newton, and then there was John Henry Newman also, the British one.
Speaker 1: Newman, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, John Henry Newman, yeah, the British also.  And so, so you hear these stories, and these are stories that help you shape your personality and your character, and it makes you tough and it makes you look to the future.  I hardly ever look backwards.  I always look to the future.
Story_ID: 28188
Speaker 1: So is there a story about how your parents [Ellen Sarku Nettey and Nathan Codjo Lawrence] met?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I don't know.  No, there is no, there's no story.  They met in Accra [Ghana].  There's no particular story that, anything exciting about that.
Speaker 1: Nothing, no good story about them walking down the street--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: There's no good story--
Speaker 1: --or they happen to, you know, or--
Speaker 2: And, you know, in those days, you can't just fall in love.  I mean the parents have to marry for you.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, this is the story.  You've gotta tell us--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: You see the parents have to marry for you.  It's not you just getting up to go and say that you are marrying this person, you know.  So once you--
Speaker 1: So your parents--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --marry, it's really a marriage between the two families.
Speaker 1: So how did it all come about?  How did your parents get together then?
Speaker 2: I think they knew each other and then they sort of, it just comes by their parents getting together and deciding that this person is a good person.
Speaker 1: Which comes first?  Do the parents say, have a meeting and say I think our son--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think that's--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --should get with your daughter--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: In their time, those, that comes first.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the families got together first, the parents?
Speaker 2: That's right, in those days.
Speaker 1: Then they tell the--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --tell their children that they're gonna marry (laughter)?
Speaker 2: That, that means that, yeah, they introduce them, you know, somehow.  And then hopefully, they all fall in love and it works out--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Now, this is a--
Speaker 2: --it works out well.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's interesting.  Now, people here, you know, consider that a odd way to do it,--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --but, you know, these marriages actually work out, which a lot of 'em here don't work out too well.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But, so how did--
Speaker 2: Well, things have changed, you know, so.
Speaker 1: So when your parents married then, it was arranged, and did--now, since your parents were Christians, they could only have--he could only have one wife, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was only one.
Speaker 1: So you can't, you know--
Speaker 2: They couldn't have more than one.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: They were Christians, staunch Christians.
Speaker 1: So even though it was an arranged marriage, he had to get it right one time (laughter)?
Speaker 2: That's right.  And I think people adjust, you know, they really adjust.  And people put aside their egos and make sure these things work.
Story_ID: 28189
Speaker 1: Okay, well, tell us something about, I guess family life in that kind of a situation 'cause you've got like different cultural influences, right, I guess?  You've got the Christian influence 'cause--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes. Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --you've got the Anglican Church.  You also have Ga tradition (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Yeah, the (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --as evidenced by the two names you have (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, well, they have that thing.  They have to blend it in their necessary proportion (unclear).  So that's what people do.  They normally blend it in their necessary proportion.
Speaker 1: How does it blend?  How does it work?
Speaker 2: It blends in the many ways that people respect the traditions, but at the same time, they know they have a strong belief in Christianity.  So they blend it in there very nicely.  It works out.  It really works out.  You're just wondering how does it work out, but it does work out.  It does work out in many ways.
Speaker 1: So, for instance, a wedding, you've got a wedding.  How does the wedding work?
Speaker 2: You have two weddings.
Speaker 1: You have two, okay.
Speaker 2: You have two weddings.  You have to have the traditional wedding where it's really between the families, and then you have the Christian wedding in the church.  So you have to have two weddings.
Speaker 1: Okay, so I'm thinking you've got to have two names--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I had two weddings (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --you have to have two weddings--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I had two weddings too.  Before the Christian wedding, the families had to do their own.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then you have the--so I had the same thing.  My, I was not in Ghana then.  I got married in England.  But my parents [Ellen Sarku Nettey and Nathan Codjo Lawrence] and my wife's parents did the traditional things, and after they had finished that, before we got married in London [England].  So you have to have two, two marriages.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, is there any pressure from one side or the other?  I mean would, I mean is there, for instance, would some want a Christian--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you cannot, you cannot do the Christian unless you've done the traditional one.
Speaker 1: Ahh, okay, so the traditional one comes first?
Speaker 2: First, yes, that comes first.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then you do the Christian one.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  All right, so, okay, now, in the traditional wedding, is it just like, is it just one day, an event one day or is it spread over several days?
Speaker 2: No, it's a one-day event.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I mean there are many preparations before, and there are many things that you do.  You, you have to--there are traditional things they expect you to do, certain gifts you have to give and it has to be received by the other side.  So it's a one-day affair.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right, now, does--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: But they normally say that, first, before, they say you have to go and knock the door.  And then, so they call it a "knocking."  So they go, your--my parents, my family goes to knock the door, and then they are accepted in, and they say the stories why they are there.  And then they agree, and then they agree on a date of the wedding, a traditional wedding.  So it's, it goes in those stages--
Speaker 1: Okay, so--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --traditionally.
Speaker 1: So that's where--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And you can break it out also in the British, American way and talk of engagement and then a marriage.  You can look at it that way if you want to.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, but the knocking of the door is--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Very important for--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --formalizes the--
Speaker 2: Formalizes it.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Knock the door, and you ask to come in and you accept it.
Speaker 1: So who goes, the father of the groom goes to--
Speaker 2: It is done by women.
Speaker 1: It's done by women, oh--
Speaker 2: Men don't participate in this at all.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: It's the women.  So, my mother's and my mother--aunties they go to meet my wife's mother and aunties.  So the males do not participate at all.
Speaker 1: Okay, it's much as the way it is today (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yes, it's--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (laughter).
Speaker 2: It's all a female affair.
Speaker 1: Okay, I know a lot of places where it's like that now.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, that's the first stage, and then, then there're like--you say there's exchanges of--
Speaker 2: Gifts.
Speaker 1: Certain gifts.
Speaker 2: Gifts, and then it's recognized.
Speaker 1: So are gifts given both ways or--
Speaker 2: Yes, it's given both ways.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  So,--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And then the families cement it and then the union is cemented.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 28190
Speaker 1: So when you think about your parents [Ellen Sarku Nettey and Nathan Codjo Lawrence] personalities, or their talents, their gifts, their habits, how they walk and how they talk, how they look, who do you think you take after the most, your mother or your father?
Speaker 2: A mixture.  In many ways, I take after my mother's coolness and doesn't let anything worry her.  And I take over my father when it comes very studious and he's very disciplined in studies, and so I took a mixture.  But I, as I sit down, I am being brought up more by my mother because my father died when I was younger.  And so most of the things I do know, after the age of nine, yes, was really things that she had taught me.
Speaker 1: Now, in--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: My father, I do know, I recognize that--
Speaker 1: Sir, in Ghanaian society, traditional society, does the father play a major role in raising his son?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in certain tribes.  In my tribe [Ga], yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In my tribe, and that's, in the Fanti tribe, but in the Ashanti tribe--Ashanti tribe, the inheritance and the uncles do more.  Your mother's brothers do more than your father.  So, because the inheritance goes through your nephews.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: See, the Ashanti king, the next king will not be his children.  It will be the children of his sisters, one of the children of his sisters.
Speaker 1: Okay, right, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so that's the heritage, and they had their own reasons why.  I mean, but not in my tribe.  My tribe, it goes through your son.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, do you have brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: I have one sister.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have one sister.
Speaker 1: Is she younger or--
Speaker 2: No, older.
Speaker 1: Older, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How much older is she?
Speaker 2: Two years older.
Speaker 1: Two, okay.
Story_ID: 28191
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Oh, (laughter) there are many, apart from fighting malaria and fighting all these type of difficulties in the Third World.  But my childhood memories are things that I really did in school and the sports and the happiness and the prizes that I won in school.
Speaker 1: Well, I'm not asking about 'em.  I'm asking if you had a, the first thing that can remember, an earliest, "an" earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: An earliest childhood, say when I was very young?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the first thing that you know that you remember?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I would say, we would like to know whether they are significant.  I think the significant ones when I was a child that I do remember, was my father [Nathan Codjo Lawrence] always insisting and always insisting wherever--you know, he traveled a lot as I mentioned to you because he was setting up schools.  But wherever we went, he would always insist that he make sure that he comes home and picks us up and makes sure that we are back home, together with him.  So I can remember the fondness very well--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --apart from the stays I stayed in hospitals (laughter), fighting malaria and so forth, but--
Story_ID: 28192
Speaker 1: That's really an issue--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so you had malaria growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.  We have many, yeah, yeah, we had--almost all of us do.  And then the ways in which our parents would like to help us through.
Speaker 1: I mean do a lot of children--
Speaker 2: They do have, yeah, because it's very common there.  (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And then you become immune to it after a while.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That is common.
Speaker 1: So, is it--I mean do most children get past it?
Speaker 2: Yes, most children gets past it.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Most children get past it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a--I know that, I know when sickle cell anemia became well known in the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Unclear) sickle cell, yes.
Speaker 1: --'70s [1970s], it was said that sickle cell trait, not the disease, is a way of staving off malaria and a lot of West Africans have the sickle cell trait.
Speaker 2: The trait, yes, yes, you're right.  But more work, I mean Bill Gates [American business magnate, investor, programmer, inventor and philanthropist] is doing more work in this area.  I mean they're trying to eradicate malaria, trying to eradicate polio, a very good human being, Bill Gates is trying to do these things.
Speaker 1: So was polio prevalent too when you were coming up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, polio was there too.
Speaker 1: So malaria, polio, a lot of--
Speaker 2: A lot of, chicken pox, small pox, all those things, and you have to get used to that.  You get immune to that.  You are vaccinated against that.
Speaker 1: So you were sick a lot growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, when I was young, I was very sick.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was sick a lot.  But after I, after the age of five, I was fine.
Story_ID: 28193
Speaker 1: What was the name of the neighborhood [Accra, Ghana] that you grew up in?
Speaker 2: Asylum Down.
Speaker 1: That's A-S-Y-L-U-M?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Down.
Speaker 2: Down, D-O-W-N, Asylum Down.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so that's where your father's [Nathan Codjo Lawrence]--it was like one house or a compound of different, of a lot of buildings?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there were a lot of buildings.  There're a lot of compounds in that area.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and so in my neighborhood, in my house, although it was just my father and mother [Ellen Sarku Nettey], but there were a lot of my cousins.  So my father's nephews and nieces, my mother's nephews and nieces, they were all staying together with us.  And they were staying together with us because their parents wanted them to also be enlightened, and be able to see how one does things around.  And so they wanted them to have a good training as well.
Speaker 1: Now, I've heard of that kind of--where parents would send their children from the country to the city to live with--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --a relative--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Relative so that you could have the, a city life and more so to be able to help them in their education.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So that's the path.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 28194
Speaker 1: Now, you had an interesting story about traveling to England in 1952--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes.  One of the things I remember very vividly of me taking up responsibility was that we went to England in 1952.  I was just seven years old.  I didn't know the place, but my father [Nathan Codjo Lawrence] had been to England several times.  My mother [Ellen Sarku Nettey] not.  It was my mother's first trip to England.  And when we went there, my father fell sick, but before then he had taken me to see a couple of his friends.  So when my father fell sick, my mother didn't know what to do.  But, and it was not easy to make phone calls to see those relat--friends and relatives.  So we left my father and my sister and I took my mother to go to see those friends and ask them to come and help.  But my mother was surprised, I knew the bus we had to take.  It was just a short, we had just been there, I guess once or so, but I could remember exactly the full steps.  And I took her straight to go and see these people, and they came back with us to help my father, yes.
Speaker 1: Now, this is remarkable, I mean 'cause London [England] is a dense place--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, a dense place, but I was able to do so.  I guess in desperation, you can--certain things come vividly, come to mind.
Speaker 1: Well, quite a--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I could see the corner where we took, and the bus where we have to stop.
Speaker 1: And quite a mind for a seven-year old, you would think--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --to be able to do that.  (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And I, I, indeed, I was able to do that to, to get help.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But then when we came back to Ghana, it wasn't long before he died.  And I think he died--there was no autopsy, so we, what we knew, I think he died of hypertension, failure of the heart and so forth.
Speaker 1: And, you know, it caused a little economic depression, I guess, in the family?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, it did.  My mother had to take on more responsibility.  And we also had to work and make things, make ends meet and study hard, you know, to get scholarships.
Story_ID: 28195
Speaker 1: Where did you start school?  What's the name of your first school?
Speaker 2: The name of my first school is Government Boys School.  It was a school that was set up by the government.  So it's a Government Boys School.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that was about two miles away from where you lived?
Speaker 2: About two to three miles away, and we had to, I had to walk every day to school, about three miles to school, carrying the books.  And we did that for many years until I was the age of twelve.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you--what was school like?  I mean how many students were at Government Boys School?
Speaker 2: Oh, there were a lot of school--there were a lot of students because the school was full.  It was one of only the few schools.  So there were a lot of students.  Maybe every year group would be about a hundred or so students, in every year group.  You had Class One to Class Seven in many ways, but in Class Five, we then go to the boarding school.
Speaker 1: Okay, now--
Speaker 2: In the sixth, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, now, did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: Oh, mathematics.  I'd always been interested in math and science.  I had always been interested in math and science.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what do--now, what inspired you to be interested in math and science when you were growing up?  Did you--
Speaker 2: What inspired me to be math and science?  First of all, it could have been either medicine or engineering, but I think that I really liked the mathematics.  I felt very comfortable in it, and I really liked it.
Speaker 1: Now, now--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And that was what moved me into that, and then also, and the culture in Ghana at that time was more to science and math education, as opposed to law and, yeah, they felt that they needed more scientists.  So the government encouraged it--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Kwame Nkrumah [leader of Ghana and its predecessor state, the Gold Coast, from 1951 to 1966] encouraged it in many ways.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And so I went to the boarding school at the age of twelve.
Story_ID: 28196
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't wanna get you there [boarding school] yet because we have to go through the Independence of Ghana first.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Because you're only, what, ten or eleven [years old], I guess, when--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was, yeah.
Speaker 1: Eleven years old when--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about, now, you're about, what would be in America, around the sixth grade, I guess, fifth or sixth grade age--
Speaker 2: Sixth grade, yes.  (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: And did you--
Speaker 2: Sixth or seventh grade, um-hum.
Speaker 1: --the rumblings about the Independence coming?  (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes--
Speaker 1: --you know, I (unclear) (simultaneous), I keep thinking in a family like yours, you'd have to know.
Speaker 2: Yes, there was, there was a lot of things about the Independence, and independence, demanding for independence and working towards independence.  You may know that during the--Kwame Nkrumah came to Ghana from the U.S., and he was part of the Big Six that were moving towards independence, who were demanding independence.  And then he broke away from them.  But then Kwame Nkrumah was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Who was the Big--wait a minute now.  We have to take these one bite at a time.
Speaker 2: The Big Six.
Speaker 1: Who was the Big Six?  Is this a Ghanaian group?
Speaker 2: A Ghanaian group.
Speaker 1: Who was in the Big Six?
Speaker 2: The Big Six included Danquah--
Speaker 1: Joseph Danquah.
Speaker 2: Joseph Danquah, [Edwards] Akufo-Addo, [Emmanuel] Obetsebi-Lamptey, [Kwame] Nkrumah, [Ebenezer] Ako-Adjei and, I think it's Soloo Adante (ph.).
Speaker 1: Okay, so these are--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, [William] Ofori Atta. Ofori Atta. Not Soloo Adante [ph.], Ofori Atta.  These were the six that were really the leaders.  And the others, the other five brought Nkrumah in.  They were there before Nkrumah, and they brought Nkrumah in as their secretary, to be the Secretary General of the--but Nkrumah fell out with them, and he took with him Ako-Adjei, and they started their own independent movement separate from this.  He was demanding independence now whilst the others were saying that we should take our time--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at independence [unclear].  So he just said, oh, look, I prefer independence with danger than servitude in tranquility.  So that was what his motto was, and he moved on and he was even detained.  He was in prison when the elections came in, and he won the elections from prison.  And (laughter) they were forced to release him.
Speaker 1: Was your family involved in Nkrumah's party or did they, were they neutral about it or what?
Speaker 2: They were very neutral.  My father [Nathan Codjo Lawrence] had passed away in 1954.  So we were very, very neutral.  We were not involved at all many ways.  But we, the kids who were seeing it.  Yeah, we were seeing it.
Speaker 1: The kids were singing it?
Speaker 2: No, we were seeing, seeing things that were happening.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were seeing, yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but my mother [Ellen Sarku Nettey] and things, my mother was not at all.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, was there some trepidation about independence coming in terms of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was, people wanted their independence because the way Kwame Nkrumah campaigned.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, they had it.  He won the elections.  He became the Prime Minister.  Well, at first they called him Leader of Government Operations and then Prime Minister and then later on, President.
Speaker 1: Now, the interesting thing--now, I hadn't thought about this before, and I really don't know.  I should know, but I don't.  But was Nkrumah the only one of that Big Six that was educated in the United States 'cause I know he went to Lincoln [University, Chester County, Pennsylvania] here and he (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: He was the only one.
Speaker 1: Was he the only one?
Speaker 2: The rest went to England.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I thought so.
Speaker 2: The rest were very much educated in England, Danquah, Ofori Atta, Obetsebi-Lamptey, they were all--
Speaker 1: It's interesting--this has probably been written about--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: He was the only one, and therefore, maybe he had a different perspective from the British folks.  Maybe the American, training in the American way of--well, maybe the same American, their fighting for independence.
Speaker 1: I'm wondering 'cause--
Speaker 2: He was the only one. Nnamdi Azikiwe [one of the leading figures of modern Nigerian nationalism; head of state of Nigeria from 1960 to 1966, serving as the second and last Governor-General from 1960 to 1963 and the first President of Nigeria from 1963 to 1966, holding the presidency throughout the Nigerian First Republic] was here [United States] too. Um-hum, and he was also demanding--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So,--
Speaker 2: The traditionalists from the British, they were very cool and they were not moving fast enough.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so Ghana, this is very significant because Ghana is the first African state--
Speaker 2: To have independence.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that had been colonized--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: They were the first, yes--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --and (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was the first state to have independence.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what was--can you remember what the sights and sounds and smells of independence were like--
Speaker 2: There was tremendous euphoria.  There was tremendous euphoria when we had independence.  Many people were rejoicing and the various little things we were given like cups and so forth.  I think I still have my cup, the independence cup.  I still have it here.
Speaker 1: What's on it?  I mean is there some--
Speaker 2: Oh, it's, yeah, it's a flag of Ghana, and the other side will be the flag of the United Kingdom, the Union Jack, yeah.
Speaker 1: The flag of--describe the flag of Ghana.
Speaker 2: The flag of Ghana, it's--and it's got many significance.  It's, it's yellow, green and red.  And they have their significance.  The red means the blood that was shed towards independence.  The green means the green fields.  The yellow means the light, and then there's a black star in the center.  So it has got its significance.
Speaker 1: And the black star, I think goes back to Marcus Garvey's [Jamaican political leader; proponent of Black Nationalism and Pan-Africanism movements] black star (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Story_ID: 28197
Speaker 1: All right, okay, so shortly after independence [1957], you went to Achimota [School], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And that's A-C-H--
Speaker 2: A-C-H-I-M-O-T-A.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, this is a famous school that--I hate to say it in this way, but elite students attend this school.
Speaker 2: Yes, it's a famous school.  It was set up by Aggrey.
Speaker 1: And that's James Aggrey? Yes, James Aggrey [an intellectual, missionary, and teacher; a native of Ghana who later emigrated to the United States, but returned to Africa for several years].  Now-- A-G-G-R-E-Y.
Speaker 2: --E-Y.  And those really behind it, you've heard of Phelps Stokes Foundation?  Phelps Stokes was behind it.  This organization in the U.S., in Washington, D.C. [District of Columbia].
Speaker 1: Yeah, Phelps Stokes Fund, educational fund--
Speaker 2: Yes, it was behind this Achimota--
Speaker 1: That is also behind Hampton Institute and quite a few other schools.
Speaker 2: Yes, and quite a few schools in South Africa.  They've done a lot.
Speaker 1: So did Achimota have the same model of industrial education and that sort of thing that--
Speaker 2: No, it had a model of both science and the arts, and the liberal arts and the--a number of them became lawyers.  A number of them became scientists, a number of them became doctors.  It was a mix at Achimota.  But I remember it vividly.  I was twelve years old when I got in there.  And I left, I've left home into a boarding school, made new friends and a new start in this school as a GS freshman, and you rise to the top.  It, it was a seven years journey.  And I was lucky, I rose to be a prefect of one of the houses--
Speaker 1: Now, that's--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And during the seven years, of course, we had to work very hard, study, good sports and form our character, and in many ways, you learned to live with people.  You learned to accommodate people, people of all kinds, from all parts of the country, from all tribes.  The unity of Ghana comes from these type of things where they forced all of us to live together as kids and grow up together.  And people came from all parts of Ghana.
Speaker 1: For example, what were some of the groups, what were some of the other groups?  Now, you're a Ga [tribe].
Speaker 2: I'm a Ga.  There were people from Hausa [ph.], Ashantis, Fantis, Ewes, all the various tribes of Ghana, from the North to the South, East to West.
Speaker 1: These are--
Speaker 2: It was really mixed up.  And they chose it intentionally to make sure that not, it's not coming from one area.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a very mixed thing.
Speaker 1: Now, I would take it that most of the students were either Christians or Muslims, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, Christians or Muslims.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You would say that maybe, just a third of Ghana is Muslims.  The other third or greater than a third are Christians, and there are some who are in the middle.  They don't know what they--neither believe in Christianity or Muslim.  There are a few like that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would think--
Speaker 2: Atheists or whatever you call them or believed in the fetish type of religion.
Speaker 1: Now, was anybody in school who was not a Christian or a Muslim?
Speaker 2: Almost all of them.  And, in fact, they would force you also in the school, we were forced to go to church.  We were forced to--if you didn't want to, then you have to go to the quiet room at that time, if you don't want to--if you don't believe in any of these things.  (Unclear) a very good training.
Speaker 1: So it's hard to not--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And I was the champion hundred yards--hundred meters champion in the school in my final year (laughter).  So we did all sorts of things, cross country, 400 meters, and I was--and then I played soccer and cricket.  So in many ways, I was an all-around sports person and as well as academic as well.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, were your studies primarily math and science at this point?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, in the beginning, no, you did English and plus, they have to make sure that you are very fluent in English and in English literature.  And we did Latin, and we did languages, French and then the science and math.  In the last two years, then you specialize in science or, or in Latin or the liberal arts, history.
Speaker 1: Now, did you have--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: The last two years, but the first five, the first five years is common.  You did everything.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the last two years you specialize in--
Speaker 2: You specialize--
Speaker 1: --mathematics and--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Did you take calculus in school--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --at Achimota?
Speaker 2: Yes, we did.  And our system, at that time was more like the British system where you did the O-levels [General Certificate of Education; Ordinary Levels] and then the A-levels [Advanced Levels].  And the last two years is A-levels, advanced levels.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 28198
Speaker 1: Now, are there any particular teachers or mentors there [Achimota School] that you remember?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  The British ones I do remember and the Americans.  Good, Kennedy [President John F. Kennedy] sent the Peace Corps.  So I had three or four Peace Corps teachers.  I had three or four Peace Corp teachers.
Speaker 1: Well, were there any Ghanaian natives who were teachers, I mean--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, there were some Ghanaians that were teachers.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you had British, Americans--
Speaker 2: British.
Speaker 1: --and Ghanaians?
Speaker 2: And Ghanaians, yes, and Canadians.
Speaker 1: And Canadians, okay.
Speaker 2: And in some cases, we had some people also from the British Colony.  We had some Indians and some people from Ceylon.  It's called Sri Lanka now, Australians.
Speaker 1: That'd be the British Commonwealth, I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah, British Commonwealth, and--
Speaker 1: Okay, so even after independence there was a good relationship with the British Commonwealth?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, after independence (unclear), good relationship (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I think the Queen, didn't the Queen come to the Independence Day--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, the Queen did not show up, but it was the Queen's cousin that day.  But the Queen later on visited.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay, so at Achimota--well,--
Speaker 2: Achimota School.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, tell us about your math studies there.  Was it easy for you to do math?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, it was easy.  You know, I always had a networking, and therefore, naturally, in the school, you had the seniors.  Those who were older than you.  And some of them were teaching us, the teachers were teaching us, the seniors were teaching us.  And so we had the community helping each other.  When I also became a senior, I also looked back and helped the younger ones as well.  You part your knowledge to them.
Speaker 1: So do you think it's possible to--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I don't see that here, by the way in the high school that my daughter was in, I was not seeing that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's common here that there's no help.  People are just on their own.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: There, it's not--it was, when we were growing up, it was different.  The help was there completely.
Speaker 1: Yeah, seems like a study group--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: See, you were in the house together, in the dormitory, all different year, levels in the dormitory.
Speaker 1: Yeah, to go home here to a house by yourself, and then be expected--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --to learn it all by yourself--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --is probably a tall order, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But there, we were all together.  So, it made a big difference.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it made a difference in my attitude, how I interrelate with people I work with.  This upbringing was very, very unique.
Story_ID: 28199
Speaker 1: You graduated from Achimota [School, Ghana] in--
Speaker 2: 1964.  There were two levels.  One is 1962 for the O-levels [General Certificate of Education; Ordinary Levels] and '64 [1964] for the A-levels [Advanced Levels].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, A-level graduation.  So if you graduated, say O [levels], then what could you expect to do with that degree?  Did you go on to college or did you--
Speaker 2: If you graduated with an O level, then you would get into work.  It's really, going to college has to be A-levels, the advanced levels, just like the British system, to get into college.  And by the way, the A-levels is one year above the high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because from there, we go to university for three years.  We don't go for four.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so when you were a senior, did you graduate--I mean when you were about ready to graduate, did you graduate with any honors?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I graduated with honors.  And, therefore, it was easy for me to get into the British--and by the way, what we took was a British exam, the advanced levels, was a British exam.  So it was easy for me to get into the university in England.
Story_ID: 28200
Speaker 1: Was there any discussion about which school [university] you would go to?
Speaker 2: No, there was not at all.  I had made up my mind, it was going to be London University [University of London, United Kingdom], and I mean others, other--it could have been Oxford [University] or Cambridge [University] if I wanted to do the sciences.  But I wanted to do engineering.  So the best engineering school in England was then Imperial College--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --of Science and Technology.
Speaker 1: Now, how did you come to the conclusion that you wanted to be an engineer?
Speaker 2: Rather than a scientist.  Yeah, because I wanted to create things, you know.  I was, had that form to create things.  Now, if you ask me whether--I could have gone either way.  I could have done medicine, and I could have done--I could have gone either way.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 28201
Speaker 1: Did you take things apart when you were growing up and put 'em--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --back together again to see what they--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --how they worked?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  I did that.  So--
Speaker 1: And what would you typically work on?
Speaker 2: Oh, radios, that, the things that you can take apart, very curious about how cars worked, but after my father [Nathan Codjo Lawrence] died, we didn't have a car.  So there was, and there was not that there.  It was only the radios. At that time, you didn't have much--telephones were very few.
Speaker 1: I think, you know, living in the United States people are used to so much waste--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --throwing things away.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: If they don't work, just throw it out, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but here if it doesn't work, you have to try to fix it, in Ghana.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, so, repairing--did you earn any money repairing items when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: No, I did not.  I had to fix it for ourselves.  Where I was, and money where I was working was working in the harbor.
Speaker 1: So what would do?
Speaker 2: In the harbor, packing things and inventory, yeah.  And I worked throughout, every, every summer when I got home, I had to work, just to earn a little bit of living.
Speaker 1: You say, like inventory.  That's something that we, you know, so--
Speaker 2: The inventory that has come in, the things that are in the harbor.  Now, you have to count them and you had to tabulate them and--
Speaker 1: So it helps to be a good mathematician--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --and it also saves your back, I guess too, to be able to do that?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, otherwise, you'd have to lift the boxes (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 28202
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about going to London [England].  You went to London in--for school, in 1965 or '64 [1964]?
Speaker 2: 1965, '65 [1965].
Speaker 1: Okay, '65 [1965].
Speaker 2: I spent one year preparing for, to go to London.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I did get, what we call a British Council Scholarship [British organization specializing in international educational and cultural opportunities] to go to London.
Speaker 1: And what did that cover?  Did that cover everything?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it covered your boarding and lodging and fees for the undergraduate, yeah, for the three years.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, was London like--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And that's where--uh?
Speaker 1: Was London like you had remembered it from when you were seven [years old]?
Speaker 2: It was different, but it was in a different condition in the sense that I was now a student.  I was responsible for myself, living with other students in hostels and dormitories and the British Council hostels, we call them.  And those British Council hostels had students from the [British] Commonwealth.  And that's where the Gandhis.  They were students.
Speaker 1: Now, which Gandhis did you meet?
Speaker 2: They, Ravi [Rajiv] and Sanjay Gandhi, the two--the children Indira Gandhi [the third Prime Minister of India, first woman Prime Minister of India, from 1966 until her assassination in 1984, and a central figure of the Indian National Congress party].
Speaker 1: Ravi [Rajiv] and Sanjay Gandhi.
Speaker 2: Um-hum, yeah.  They were the children of Indira Gandhi, very unique, very intelligent woman.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's where I met them, and we, we did not really keep in touch.  I mean we didn't keep in touch, but--. And so I did my bachelor's degree.  And then I had to--that was the end of my scholarship.  And then I had to move on, and so in moving on, I had to get some tuition support.  And then for my boarding and lodging, I had to work.
Speaker 1: So your bachelor's degree was in electrical engineering [Imperial College, University of London]?
Speaker 2: Engineering, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, who were some of your teachers?  Was there any special teacher or mentor or were they all about the same or what?
Speaker 2: Oh, there were, more so in the graduate school when people started taking notice of me.  The undergraduate, we were so many and--
Story_ID: 28203
Speaker 1: You received your D.L.C.--D.I.C. [Diploma of the Imperial College] degree?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's a--
Speaker 1: What is that, the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It's a master's degree.
Speaker 1: Okay,--
Speaker 2: You see when you start the program, you can either do a master's degree or you go straight to a Ph.D.  And I went straight to the Ph.D.  But after the first year, they will give you this diploma.  It's not a master's degree, but it's a diploma, but then you continue to do your Ph.D.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you don't take time to--
Speaker 2: You don't time, yeah--
Speaker 1: --get a master's degree and graduate--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: You just go straight on.
Speaker 1: Go straight through.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, and--
Speaker 2: And that is where my, I shaped another part of my career.  I had money for tuition, no money for board and lodging.  And I had to make it myself.  So what I did was to work in restaurants and hotels.  So I first started as a dishwasher.  So after school, I'll go into this hotel.  I was a dishwasher there, and believe it, it's good to do in the hotel because there, you get the food.  So I get money for pocket money and things and buy my books and things, and then I was working.  So I was working as a dishwasher, but I was very reliable.  So every day I was there promptly, at the time they said I should be there.  And then one day, the assistant chef, they didn't come in.  So the chef said, I should leave the dishwashing that night because we could do that later on, and they made me a dumbwaiter.  You know what a dumbwaiter is?  It's not a--dumbwaiter is the one that is at the kitchen.  The waiters bring the, the waiters will bring the slip of what is to be, is to be cooked.  And then you take it and give it to the cook.  And then you--when it's ready, you put it on the, this lift, and then you move it up.  That's what they call a dumbwaiter.  So they made a dumbwaiter.  So that was a promotion from dishwasher to a dumbwaiter (laughter).  So I had my first promotion.  Then I was there reliable again, and then the assistant chef and the new assistant chef, they didn't come in.  So the guy said, okay, leave this dumbwaiter, you will become the assistant chef, and then they promoted the dishwasher person to be a dumbwaiter.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you became the sous chef, I guess.
Speaker 2: I became assistant chef first--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and then I was so reliable that the guy looked around, and he said he is going to make me the breakfast chef.  You know, as the assistant chef, we were doing, I was doing the sous, I was doing the desserts and so forth.  But he said, I will make--I have so much headache. They call me in the mornings, "So Victor, you become the breakfast chef."  So I ended up as the breakfast chef, and the guy was so happy because every day I was there.  And I also wanted it because I would have my breakfast, go to school.  On my way back from school, I can get to the hotel, and he will give me--I can pick any food and cook and eat and then go, and go back to study in the dorms.  Now, after, when I, in my second year of graduate school, then it be--I took upon the responsibility of being their, what we call the warden of the hostel.  So that was also very lucrative.  Then it meant that I have free accommodation.  And I have free food, so I was all set to finish my graduate school, my graduate studies.  I had the tuition taken care of by the school, the food taken care of in the hotel.  Where I was sleeping was also free because it was the--I became a deputy warden (unclear).  So that's how I got myself through the graduate studies and I finished.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 28204
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this.  Now, what were you focused on for your Ph.D.?  Who was your advisor and--well, first of all, who was your advisor, your Ph.D. advisor?
Speaker 2: Okay, I had two advisors.  One was Professor Colin Cherry, and the other one was Professor Robert Bogner.
Speaker 1: That's C-O-L-I-N?
Speaker 2: Yes, C-O-L-I-N.
Speaker 1: C-H-E-R-R-Y?
Speaker 2: Colin, yes.
Speaker 1: Colin Cherry and--
Speaker 2: C-H-E--yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and who was the other one?
Speaker 2: And then Robert Bogner--
Speaker 1: Robert--
Speaker 2: Robert Bogner, B-O-G-N-E-R.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hum, now when I got in there after my, the first year, the professor asked me what I wanted to do.  So I told him.  He just looked at me and said, "Okay, just do these experiments."  It was different from what I wanted to do.
Speaker 1: Well, what did you say you wanted to do?
Speaker 2: I told him that I wanted to do something we call "spatial feedback."  I wanted to take the electromagnetic waves and feed them back.  And he wanted to make sure that I knew what I was talking about or whether I had really known this.  He said, "Okay, fine, you do these experiments."  And they were different from what I wanted to do.  So I started working on those experiments.  And then it, then I went back to him again.  He said, "Okay, whatever you wanted to do in the, in the air and atmosphere, why can't you do that in the two-dimensional simulations and so forth," because he, where he put me to--then I started working on that.  I said, okay, let me look at these simulations.  And it ended up to, into digital signal processing.  It was at the forefront of it.  So the professor steered me into that direction.
Speaker 1: Okay, so let me just in ways that I can understand this, let me repeat it back to you.  That you wanted to do actual experiments--
Speaker 2: I wanted to do electromagnetic waves.
Speaker 1: Yeah, wave experiments.  And he said, why don't you do a--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: He said, "Why don't you come and look at this these transistors and all these pulses and so forth?"
Speaker 1: But he suggested that you do it computationally, right?
Speaker 2: And then when we were doing it, he said, oh, can you do these things?  Isn't it easier rather to do these things compu--in simulations and computationally than looking, putting up these antennas?  And, in fact, it didn't work anyway.  If I had gone, doing what I wanted to do, it wouldn't have worked anyway.  So he steered me in the right direction.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, well, tell us about--
Speaker 2: So that's Professor Colin Cherry, and he's a very well-known guy.
Story_ID: 28205
Speaker 1: Tell us about the advantage of doing things computationally rather than actually trying to--
Speaker 2: To do it--first of all, it's much easier because you would do everything by simulations in the computer.  Then computers were coming up.  So you could do a lot of your simulations.  And when it works in the simulations form before you go and build something.  So those are the advantages of really doing simulations.
Speaker 1: So, the--
Speaker 2: Really understand (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --in other words, the figures don't lie, right, if it's--
Speaker 2: No, no, if you do the simulations.  And you learn to play with the computer.  Those computers were just coming up.
Speaker 1: So what kind of computer were you using then?
Speaker 2: Oh, they were IBM [International Business Machines] computers, and they were the computers where, you're not sitting on your computer.  You have to put it on punch cards.  You do things on punch cards, and then you go and submit it.
Speaker 1: So were you using Cobalt [programming language] or--
Speaker 2: Time cards, we called it time cards. Fortran [programming language], the scientific language--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Fortran, right.
Speaker 2: Yes, the Cobalt was for the business language.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were doing Fortran--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: So we had Fortran and time cards.  Those were the days you go and submit it, and if you make a simple mistake, it takes so long for you to re-submit your deck of cards again.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what was the title of your dissertation or can you kind of--if you can't remember exactly, can you give us what it was--
Speaker 2: I think it's 'Design of Digital Field Tests Using Orthogonal Functions'.
Speaker 1: Design--
Speaker 2: --of Digital Field Tests Using Orthogonal Functions.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, and the last part, Using Orthogonal-
Speaker 2: Orthogonal, 90 degrees, O-R-T-H-O-G-O-N-A-L, orthogonal functions.  And it had applications in so many things, in speech--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in communications.  So that was what my thesis was.
Speaker 1: Now, how would--what did you discover that you, you know, new, doing this?  Did you have to--I think your Ph.D., you have to discover something new, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that you could design these things using orthogonal functions.  I had to look at some orthogonal functions and see whether you can use these functions in designing, in the design.  And they were called Walsh functions.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they had you--the mathematicians have used it, not for any application, but it was an elegant way of looking at mathematics.
Speaker 1: Okay, what do you mean by elegant?  I hear mathematicians saying--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That you can express things in a very nice form, in a very close form using these functions.
Speaker 1: Okay, let's see, now, how did that, how did your discoveries, like change the field of electrical engineering?
Speaker 2: Oh, in many ways because it was, I was at the forefront of digital signal processing in many ways.  I was one of the very, very first few people that were doing that.  And I looked at what you could do with finite precision because you don't have infinite precision as you have these days, because things were very, very few number of bits you could use.  So I was one of the few people.  And then the, the various noise levels and things that are generated, instability of these field tests.  So I worked on a number of these things that, to help, using orthogonal functions first to design, and then after that, what are the noise effects?  How do you make these things stable? Stabilizing them.  So those were things that I did work on.
Story_ID: 28206
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so did you wanna break down what you did, a little bit more?
Speaker 2: Yes, I will break down what I did a little bit more.  Okay, so the idea of using these digital filters was to be able to help you improve the quality of a signal.  That means the here--for instance, if I am speaking and there is a lot of noise in the environment, I like to suppress the noise.  I like to take a filter that you put the noise through, and therefore, it becomes a better quality voice.  At the end, this is what these filters were being used for.  These filters could also be used in many other applications, in video.  It could be used in applications in radiology.  It could be used in applications in, defense applications as well.  So the designing of filters is important, and doing that digitally is important because you can be able to build it and you can build it in a more stable form than whatever you could do with analog.  So that was one of the breakthroughs that we had.
Story_ID: 28207
Speaker 1: So after you graduated [with a Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of London, England], what were your options?  Did you know you were gonna go back to Ghana or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, when I graduated I spent about six months or so in England with General Electric Company of United Kingdom.  I spent that time there to learn a little bit about industry and at the same time, I was a post-doc [postdoctoral trainee] in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Imperial College [London, England] because my professor still wanted me around.  I was working with him.  So it was there that Bell Labs, AT&T, came to recruit me, because AT&T was recruiting worldwide.  They wanted the best scientists they could get everywhere on this earth.  So they came to Imperial College.  And when they came to Imperial College, they saw my professor, and so my professor told them, told me, "Oh, there are these visitors from America.  They want to come and recruit.  I know you are interested in going to Ghana, but why don't you just show them around so that they can become, become acquainted with the university."  So I started showing them around, and as we went from one place to the other, the gentleman said, oh, why don't I also come and work with them.  And I told him that, no, I'm going to Ghana because--so they said, "Okay, you just come for a trip."  So, they came and wrote back to me that I should come, because I think after I was taking them around, they were so much interested in me.  So they sent me a ticket to come for interview, booked my hotels for me.  Those were the good days for AT&T.  So they gave me a ticket.  I took the flight to JFK [John F. Kennedy Airport, New York City], and from JFK, you know what they did?  They gave me a, they made me take a helicopter ride from JFK to Newark [New Jersey].  First time, I sat in a helicopter.  So I said, "Gee, this must be a very good company."  And then from Newark, I did the interview in New Jersey.  And then they sent me to Chicago also to do--Illinois, Naperville, also to go and do some interviews there.  And then I went back.  It wasn't long, they wrote to me that they wanted me.  And I told them that I have to go to Ghana first because my mother [Ellen Sarku Nettey] wanted me to come over.
Story_ID: 28208
Speaker 1: So that was '73 [1973], and I went to Ghana first and started teaching at the university, Kumasi [Ghana], just to see how.  And then came the--
Speaker 2: Now, when you were teaching at the University of Kumasi, was your--your mother [Ellen Sarku Nettey] was still living in Accra [Ghana]?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Still living in Accra, but it was so easy to see her over the weekends.
Speaker 2: Was it as far--is Kumasi far away from Accra?
Speaker 1: No, a hundred and sixty miles.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So I could see her regularly, once a month, once every two weeks.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So I was teaching there, and then came the--
Speaker 2: Well, what was--before we get out of there, I just wanted to ask you about the University of Kumasi.  What was it like in those days?  How many students did you have and did they have an electrical engineering department?
Speaker 1: Yeah, they had an electrical engineering department.  They are the engineering school, and they had electrical, mechanical, civil, aeronautical.
Speaker 2: So in '73 [1973], what was the political atmosphere in Ghana like?  That was--was that when Jerry Rawlings [former president of Ghana] was--
Speaker 1: Jerry Rawlings came--by the way, Jerry Rawlings is, was in my house [at Achimota School, Ghana].  You know, I was his house prefect.
Speaker 2: Oh, I didn't know that.
Speaker 1: We will get to that point also (laughter) in time.  In the school in which I was in, Jerry Rawlings, in my house.  So I knew Jerry Rawlings since 1960.
Speaker 2: Okay, so he was in Achimota at--
Speaker 1: He was in my house, he was my junior.  He was a few--I was four years ahead of him.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But I used to look after him there 'cause I was a prefect of the house.
Speaker 2: And Jerry Rawlings became a flight lieutenant, then the President of Ghana.
Speaker 1: Then the president, yeah, so we remained friends since--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --because we were in the same house.  Yeah, I used to tell people, we used to eat together and so forth, you know.  So--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So that was in '73 [1973], but by the way also in the same school was [John] Atta Mills [president of Ghana from 2009 to 2012].
Speaker 2: Oh, Atta, oh, yeah, who's now the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: He was one year ahead of him--me, the late Atta Mills.
Speaker 2: Yeah, who was a president too.
Speaker 1: He was president too.  Yeah, he was one year ahead of me, and then Jerry, flight lieutenant, Jerry John Rawlings.  And I was friendly with Atta Mills, and I'm still friendly with Jerry John Rawlings as well.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 28209
Speaker 1: Now, so, the coup came [Ghana].  There was a coup around '74 [1974], so I could not--I had to leave.  And so I told--not that I had to leave, but I felt that I could have better opportunities in the United States.  So I wrote back to AT&T, Bell Labs--
Speaker 2: So is this after the coup or--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, so when the--now, this is the coup that installed--
Speaker 1: [Ignatius Kutu] Acheampong [military head of state of Ghana who ruled from 13 January 1972 to 5 July 1978, when he was deposed in a palace coup], they call him.
Speaker 2: --oh, Acheampong.
Speaker 1: General Acheampong.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 1: After that--seventy--
Speaker 2: Okay, now, was the atmosphere kind of tense after the coup?  I imagine it was.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Acheampong takes over.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Things were not that good, so I left.
Speaker 2: Well, was it easy to leave or, I mean, 'cause I know after a coup, sometimes they don't let you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: It's easy to leave, but I didn't have any money.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you leave--
Speaker 1: You can't take any currency, but, so I left--I was able to buy a ticket, and then I had sixty dollars on me.  So the sixty dollars, I went through London, spent some on the trains and so forth and then connected to the [United] States.
Speaker 2: So you only had sixty dollars when you left?
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I had my ticket.
Speaker 2: Oh, you had a ticket, okay.
Speaker 1: And I only had sixty dollars on me, and spent some of this.  And then when I came--I didn't know--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: So did you go by boat or did you go by--
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: --did you leave by boat or--
Speaker 1: No, by plane.
Speaker 2: By plane, okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.  I left by plane.  And I hadn't done my homework well.  The only way I knew how to go from [John F.] Kennedy [Airport, New York City] to Newark [Airport, New Jersey] was by helicopter.  So I spent thirty dollars on my helicopter ride (laughter).  It was a thirty dollar ride (laughter).  So I took a helicopter and therefore, I had only thirty dollars left on me.  And then the only way I knew how to go from Newark to my hotel where they had put me was to pay a limo, another ten dollars.  So I had twenty dollarson me.  So to eat and then to move around.  So Friday, it was, it was on a Friday.  So I came, and I went and reported.  And so I was hoping that they would give me my ticket immediately so I could have some money on me.  They said, oh, no, we have to do some conversion of your, this thing.  So I ended up not having anything on me, eventually what, through the weekend.
Story_ID: 28210
Speaker 1: But anyway, on Monday, they came and picked me up again to Bell Labs.  And I explained to this guy--his name is Kent Mina, wonderful guy, wonderful guy, wonderful guy.  I explained to Kent Mina, so Kent said, okay, check out of the hotel and come and stay in my house with me.  So he was also doing--so he was then also rebuilding his house, but it was okay.  So his son, he gave me his son's bed, and his son went and stayed, slept with them in their bedroom, gave his son's room.  And he used to take me to work until my ticket conversion was done, and I was given $564.00.  Now, immediately, he said, okay, Victor, now you have this, and I said, I have this.  So they were going to now get an apartment for me.  So he said, then if you live there, you may have to get a car.  So he took me to buy a car, and that was a time with people were throwing their cars away, the big cars.  So I got a big Mercury station wagon.  I got a big Mercury station wagon.  And then he said, oh, Victor, you need insurance.  So I also, so the 564 [dollars] bought me the car and he got me an insurance as well.  Insurance was $103 or something, insurance, and then the other was the car.  So I started then driving.  And then I went to the apartment they had--AT&T had got for me, but they had paid the down payment.  So when I was going, he gave me a small bed.  He gave me plates, he gave me towels.  This is a very wonderful guy, and I still keep in touch with him ever since.  And he, he was the guy I came to work for anyway.
Speaker 2: And his name is--
Speaker 1: Kent Mina.
Speaker 2: Kent--
Speaker 1: K-E-N-T and M-I-N-A.
Speaker 2: Okay, M-I-N-A?
Speaker 1: A, yes, M-I-N-A.  I have to, wonderful guy.
Speaker 2: Now, it seems to me though--
Speaker 1: Now, and then I was--then my wife--yeah, I got married in '73 [1973], so my wife was in London [England].  We were both in Ghana [unclear].  So when we left, she stayed in London for me to come and settle here and then joined me later on.
Speaker 2: Well, it seems to me that you were a very important man.  Bell Labs, which is full of geniuses, collaborating with each other, making each other smarter, of all those people, they really wanted you to be a part of Bell Labs.
Speaker 1: Yes, they really--
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: --wanted me to be, and, and it was also the fact that I met the executive at that time was Sol [Solomon] Buchsbaum [American physicist and technologist; chair of the White House Science Council under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, and as a senior executive at Bell Laboratories]--
Speaker 2: How do you spell his last--
Speaker 1: Solomon Buchsbaum, S-O-L, Solomon Buchsbaum, B-U--I have to give you, the B-U-C-S, B-U-C-H--B-A-U-M.  I'll have to give you the correct spelling, Buchsbaum.
Speaker 2: Buchsbaum.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Buchsbaum.  Now, Sol Buchsbaum had had a difficult life before.  He fled at the age of thirteen from Europe when the Jew--when Hitler was going after them (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: So he fled the Holocaust--
Speaker 1: He fled the Holocaust and went to Canada, and then Canada to the U.S. [United States]. So as soon as he knew that I was in a place where the soldiers and so forth were in charge and so forth, he was determined to get me out of the place.  He kept the job for me.  He kept writing to the American Embassy that they had an employee that had to be helped to get from Ghana to the United States.  See, my life had been fortunate that I had met some people that have really helped me, and that has also shaped my life also in trying to help others as well and being completely loyal to people (unclear)--Buchsbaum is one, I mean he didn't know me from anywhere, but he decided that my life could be in danger or he could help, and he went out of his way to do so.  Kent Mina is another guy.  I came without any money, and he gave me shelter.  He gave me food.  I mean I was eating free with, at his place.  He gave me shelter, and even when I was leaving him to start, he made sure I had a bed.  He gave me a small radio.  So it has been a wonderful time of help by others, which I never forget.
Story_ID: 28211
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about the atmosphere at Bell Labs [New Jersey]?  I mean people talk about it as this place where--
Speaker 2: It's a unique place.  It's a utopia.  It's a great place to work.  It's a great place to be able to invent.  It's an atmosphere where people liked each other, where people worked together, where people had a common goal, to create and develop technology for humanity.  That's the atmosphere, you can, then--we were developing technology for humanity, across the board, not only producing the telephone system, but things that we worked on had many, many applications in biomedical engineering, in other forms of engineering, to (unclear) technology for humanity.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were hired as a--
Speaker 2: Member of technical staff.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: Member of technical staff.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was the first level.  Well, it's a level higher than technician because there were people who had bachelor's [degree] or no degree, but they were the technicians.  We were designing, we were inventing, and they were building for us.  I was hired as a member of technical staff--
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: --in research.  And I continued my work on the digital signal processing.  That means using this into speech and image processing and data communications.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so--
Speaker 2: And the data communications is how do you send data bits from a computer to a terminal or from a terminal to a computer at that time?  That's what we were working on.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 28212
Speaker 1: Now, in '78 [1978], you published an article called 'Digital Processing Techniques in Communications' in the [IEEE; The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers] Communications Magazine of the--
Speaker 2: IEEE, yes. I did.  I did publish that--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: It was a fundamental (unclear)--
Speaker 1: In '78 [1978], now, with--is this the dawn of the terminals and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in '78 [1978], well, we started digital signal processing in the--'73 [1973], '74 [1974]. In '78 [1978], it went into applications of this digital signal processing into data, into speech, into image.  And that was where the applications started coming in.  Now, and then I switched over into--from pure research into development areas of Bell Labs where I took the work--I was working on research, to have it developed.  And, therefore, that's when we did the work on the modems, that's the precursor (unclear)--and I made sure that the modems could be compatible on the AT&T network as well as in, worldwide, internationally.  So I was working on the Japanese network, the British network, the French network.  So I really looked at this and made sure that data communications could be--and what we were building, could be used on any network in the world.  And we standardized at CCITT [Comite Consultatif International Telephonique et Telegraphique], at the ITU [International Telecommunication Union].  And in fact, the genesis of that work was many years later on, I think in 2004, or is it 2001, 2002?  They gave me the inter--the Award in International Communications. It was the genesis of that work, where I made sure the compatibility of the U.S., European networks, and the Japanese networks were all compatible and they could have this exchange of information.
Speaker 1: Okay, so when did you solve that problem, I mean to make that they're all--
Speaker 2: Compatibility?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the compatibility.
Speaker 2: 1982, thereabout.
Speaker 1: So before that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: We standardized it.
Speaker 1: Before that time, they weren't compatible.  They were, you know--
Speaker 2: No, no, the networks were compatible for speech.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not for data.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we got the modems, and made sure it was compatible working on AT&T network, the Japanese network, the European network.  We did experiments and trials, after the thing was standardized.  And we presented the results to the ITU--it was called CCITT then, to the ITU.
Story_ID: 28213
Speaker 1: Now, what was, what did you receive the Gulleman-Cauer Prize for?
Speaker 2: Oh, that was in the--that was even before I went into applications [at Bell Labs, New Jersey], the Gulleman-Cauer Prize was a prize for helping stabilize digital filters and inventing a new arithmetic.  You know, in arithmetic, we have sign magnitude or two's complement arithmetic, but we invented another one completely, that completely stabilized these systems.
Speaker 1: So you invented a new arithmetic?
Speaker 2: Yes, that stabilized these systems.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: And these are today used in digital signal processors.
Speaker 1: Now, can you break that down for, you know, people that are not scientists, I guess--
Speaker 2: What (laughter)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --what do you mean by a new arithmetic?
Speaker 2: --what this new arithmetic is?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, normally, when you are doing arithmetic, if you want to round off, and you want to round it off to either sign magnitude or, there's one way you look at the sign, the magnitude--the sign.  And if it is negative or positive, you do something, you do one thing or the other.  That's one way of doing sign magnitude, rounding.  We can have two's complement rounding, and two's complement, you also do it in a different way.  So our arithmetic was looking at it carefully, and sometimes you do sign magnitude.  Sometimes you do two's complement.  You mix it up in a randomized way, but it has a certain pattern to it.  It has a certain pattern to it.  And it depended upon the previous rounding that you had done.  So it was a new, complete new arithmetic.  But it stabilized--that was what stabilized these systems.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that enabled the other things, I mean the--
Speaker 2: That enabled us to be able to build filters, build oscillators, build equalizers digitally, and that saw itself in many, many different applications.
Story_ID: 28214
Speaker 1: '83 [1983], you wrote a paper about the multiprocessor implementation of adaptive digital filters.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right, so this is--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And that was a very noble way for implementing filters in a very economical way.
Speaker 1: Okay, so as a person who's unfamiliar with this completely, I'm just--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Unclear) filters.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the filters are filtering out signals that are not--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah--
Speaker 1: --the signals that you don't want.
Speaker 2: You, you, yeah, you have to--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Unwanted signals.
Speaker 2: Unwanted signals out.  So these--that's what these filters did.  And, in fact, just at the beginning of this conversation, he [videographer, Matthew Hickey] told me that he was filtering something.  He said something polarized or non-polarized.  These are filters--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.
Speaker 2: So you pass it through or you don't get it through.  These are what filters do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In fact, you can have filters, in that terminology, you can have filters that filter different colors of light.  So only blue can go through or red or, yes.  Now, these are filters, optical filters, but then there are filters that are looking at your sound, and we can filter in in such a way that it becomes more clearer.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is--you're in a, this is the age of, I mean today everybody's swiping cards, and they've got cell phones and all these things are--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: This is--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --things that people take for granted now--
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: --but--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --and these things are now inside these, all the cell phones and so forth.  So I can go with the progression.  When I moved into--'78 [1978] thereabouts, and I moved into designing some of these things, we designed it for data communications.  We designed it for wireless communications, the modulations and the signal processing.  And I'll tell you the generations of wireless--Jesse Russell [also a HistoryMaker] may have told you--and then we did it for video processing as well.  These things are used in all this.
Speaker 1: Now, you mentioned Jesse Russell.  He was critical in the development of the digital--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: The wireless, the second generation, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, um-hum.
Speaker 2: The first generation was all analog.  The second generation was digital, and the digital--the things the components of the things he used were the things that we developed, the digital signal processes, and digital signal filtering.  He used them in this wireless application.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he's--now, Jesse Russell is a black man who lives in--he has a company now in New Jersey--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --where he's working on another generation of cell phones now.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: So these were things he used.  But he found out that, you know, the analog phones were very huge.  And they came at an interesting time.  People always say this, that our chairman at that time, they had done some experiments in 1983 in Chicago [Illinois] area on this wireless phone.  And so he came back and said, he asked his colleagues, [Donald] MacKenzie and others, whether this was gonna be useful.  And, of course, they would say, no, because it was in a briefcase.  They didn't know that what Jesse and David Goodman could do was to go to second generation, all digital, and that second generation (unclear) the phone and led to the personal phone.  And that's why you have millions and millions and billions of phones today.  Now, when you go and say what are the components in it, that's where you discover people like me having done the work on digital signal processing and digital field tests, modulations that we used in data, they adopted all these things into the wireless phones.
Speaker 1: From what I understood from what he said was that people were trying to carry the transmitter around with them in a case, a suitcase--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --instead of--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Briefcase, yes.
Speaker 1: So if the transmitter could be put in a tower some place, then everybody could have little, a smaller phone, and the tower take care of broadcasting the signals around--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, that was part of it, so--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --instead of carrying this briefcase--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --a lot of the processing was put in the towers.  And the handset was a smaller processing in there.  But that is one.  If we hadn't gone digital, you could not do it in a smaller--you could do it, but it would still be big.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right, it was when we went digital, made this possible.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 28215
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, say what you were saying about the development, I mean the growth of cell phone use today.
Speaker 2: Yeah, because they went from the first generation to the second generation [wireless technology], and they also did it in such a way that a lot of things were done in the transmitters.  Jesse [Russell; also HistoryMaker] explained to you, and the things that they used were the components that I had developed, together with my colleagues [at bell Laboratories, New Jersey].  And that made the phones very small and made it very efficient.  And they've gone from second generation to third generation, to fourth generation.  And Jesse, now his company is working on the fourth generation.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's where some of this--in between, I did a lot of other work.  One of the things that I worked on was what we call the future secure voice telephone.  The future, secure voice telephone using still the techniques that I had developed earlier in digital filtering, modulation, speech coding.  In that time, in 1984 thereabouts, '84 [1984], '85 [1985], '86 [1986], the U.S. Defense Department [Department of Defense; DOD] wanted to have a generation of phones that were encrypted, a generation of phones that was digital.  And so I worked on the future, secure voice terminal.  In fact, the terminals were built, were used in the White House on the decks of the generals, when I think--involved just simple things like the speech.  We have to digitize the speech, code it in such a way that you have it in a number of bits, compressed it into a small number of bits, and then encrypt it.  So then we had to use digital modulation to do so.  So this was what really was the future secure voice terminal, FSVS, and we had the whole generation of terminals for the U.S. government.  So that was one application.  Other applications was mentioned, this speech and filtering for wireless and then also for video as well.  Those were things that we did do.
Speaker 1: Now, this is in the '80s [1980s] as well?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in the '80s.
Story_ID: 28216
Speaker 1: So the digital technology now that people use in their television sets exclusively now 'cause we don't use analog anymore, was developed in the '80s [1980s] it seems like.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, a lot of it was, some of the components.  By the way, I was also one of the people that built the first HDTV [high-definition television] receivers.  And so I have an Emmy Award--
Speaker 1: Oh, right, right, that's--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: In 1997, Emmy Award for--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I saw it in here, and I wondered--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: HDTV standard.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, also my group, together with others in Bell Labs really did this, the video coding and the modulation, digital modulation, go to it, made the HDTV.  So HDTV that you see or digital TV that you see people, it has its generations (unclear) in some of the work that I did.
Story_ID: 28217
Speaker 1: So, as a--I see here that as a young man, you were made a fellow of IEEE [The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and you were only like thirty-eight [years old], and then as a--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you were made a fellow of AT&T Bell Labs [New Jersey] in '92 [1992]--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --and so--
Speaker 2: And a member of the National Academy [of Engineering] and then fairly recently, just this, less than a month ago, I became a fellow of the National Academy of Inventors, just recent.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, this is--you know, so you did a lot early, a lot of--in '86 [1986], you were department head of the Digital Techniques Department at Bell Labs.
Speaker 2: Yes.  That was where all these things that I had invented, we were pushing them into different systems, communication systems.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: Under my department, yeah.
Story_ID: 28218
Speaker 1: Tell us now, in the heyday of the days at Bell Labs [New Jersey], what was a typical day like for you?
Speaker 2: A typical day (laughter), wake up very early and sometimes you do your inventions at home and then get onto the work and meet with your colleagues and explain things to them, and they explain things to you.  It was a very cordial relationship.  And we worked many, many, many hours.  There are a lot of--because it was exciting.
Speaker 1: On a typical day, how long would you be at the Lab?
Speaker 2: Oh, at least twelve hours, at least twelve hours.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, now--
Speaker 2: So it was really exciting.  You were never bored.  And it was like a small home too because you could get everything that you wanted.  In there, we had a post office.  In there we had the dry cleaners.  In there we had the food in the cafeterias, different cafeterias, and coffee breaks.  It was wonderful.  It was really a wonderful--and then we had the exercising machines.  So it was really a very wonderful place to really work.
Speaker 1: And you're surrounded by other scientists working on similar or complementery--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Other scientists working on similar or complementary things and exchange, and that's where you, most of the inventions come in, when you exchange ideas with others working on different things that you could never think about.
Speaker 1: Can you think of an instance where that happened with you, where you were inspired by somebody's idea or they were inspired by yours?
Speaker 2: Yes, in many ways.  For instance, Arun Netravali, who became president of Bell Labs, yes, he was, he had always been a video expert.  And I had always been the data transmission expert.  And we got together.  And that led to some of these inventions in HDTV [high-definition television].  And that led to the Emmy Award that we had together.  So that's an example--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: This was in 1997?
Speaker 2: It's the same, yes, and the same in the FSVS [future secure voice system].  There were these people in Merrimack Valley (unclear), thinking about how they could do secure voice, and then when they got to me, they were going to use analog.  I said, no, you do all things digitally, and we can design these things for you.  And that led to the future, secure voice terminal.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So these things happen all the time.
Speaker 1: Okay, so we were talking about you being a department--
Speaker 2: Head.
Speaker 1: --head at a certain point.  Then you become vice president--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Well, you were director of advance multimedia communications.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And then--
Speaker 2: And those were the days when we started to go multimedia, when you can have both speech, image, video, everything combined.  And then from there on, I became the vice president for the whole of advanced communications technology.  Anything new that they wanted to put into the network, I was responsible for.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were responsible for coordinating the ideas of others--
Speaker 2: Coordinating and the people underneath me, and coordinating and moving them, deciding what we could do.  I had about 500 or so scientists working for me.
Speaker 1: In 1996, you were issued a patent for coding for digital transmission with Mr. Netraveli--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) We had that together.  That's why I said that he was somebody that's had an influence on me, coming from the video, I, coming from the other direction.
Story_ID: 28219
Speaker 1: And I have a note here that you also interacted with Senator Bill Frist on the--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --science and technology committee, right?
Speaker 2: That's right.  Now, the young--I wouldn't call him a young senator, but he was a new senator that had been brought--that had joined, that had come into Congress at that time.  It was during his first few years.  And so they decided that, AT&T decided that we should support the science and technology committee.  And so I was the one that was asked to go to help the science and technology committee.  So I assigned one of my guys into Washington [District of Columbia] to work in Washington in Senator Bill Frist's office as the scientist there.  And that's when I interacted with Bill Frist as the, he was then in charge--head of the science and technology subcommittee for the Senate.
Speaker 1: So, he actually had someone in his office that was his chief advisor on science and technology from Bell Labs?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the person was working for me.  So I was supervising the person.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's interesting like, Bill Frist, as I remember was an M.D.  He was a--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, he was an M.D., very nice man--
Speaker 1: --Senator--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --Senator from Tennessee.  So he was in charge of the science and technology committee.  And J. Rockefeller was the minority, and he was the majority at that time.  So I worked for both of them.  But one person was in Bill Frist's office.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, in ninety--also in--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: His name is Tom Wood.  And then after I rotated some more, I put Carolyn Nguyen, Dr. Carolyn Nguyen there as well to work there.  So for the, for four years, I was completely supporting him, for more than four years.  And then, of course, later on he became the majority leader.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so for six years or so, I was supporting him.
Speaker 1: That's remarkable.

Speaker 1: In 1997--now, is this a book that you published with Ahamed?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Syed Ahamed, yes, a book on--
Speaker 1: Intelligent Broadband--
Speaker 2: intelligent networks, intelligent broadband networks ['Intelligent Broadband Multimedia Networks'].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hum, where the networks are intelligent, and how do you make sure that this network is intelligent.  Later on I can tell you what then I came to do, later on here.
Speaker 1: Now, what is an intelligent network (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Intelligent networks means in many ways that the ultimate that we would like to see eventually, not this transition, in such a way that the network--and I continued it here in Stevens [Institute of Technology, Hoboken, New Jersey], that a network is so intelligent.  For instance, I can come in and say, all I have to do and say, I would like to talk to all my cousins.  The network will know where all my cousins are and notify them that, hey, there's gonna be a family meeting.  So do that.  And then it will tell all them of the time and connect all of them.  That's what we mean by the ultimate, intelligent network.  And I'm working on that here, here, here in Stevens.  Now, then another thing too you could do is, okay, so you make a phone call.  And I've called maybe my mother [Ellen Sarku Nettey] or my grandmother or someone, so the network knows the situation in the house where my grandmother is.  So the network can come in and say, Victor, you are going to speak to your grandmother but just to know that your grandmother today is not feeling very well, and so don't be too long and don't be obnoxious and (unclear).  These things, the network is so intelligent it can translate things for you.  It can help you do many things that you cannot do otherwise.  We've been working on this for some time.  We are not there yet, but eventually, we will get there, where the network is your personal assistant, your network is your servant.  The network that you see as your servant.
Speaker 1: Now, did you work on the--
Speaker 2: Bell Data Network.
Speaker 1: No, the, for instance, AT&T calls me when my bill is due, and if I pick up the phone, there's a voice that confirms I'm Larry Crowe, and they confirm my phone number and my account number, and then they ask me for a payment (laughter).
Speaker 2: Um-hum, you see the components of things that I worked on, added together can develop these type of things.  That's why we call them intelligent, these are the type of things.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and if I say something else, it says, "Do I understand you?  Can you repeat that?"  I mean they--
Speaker 2: Um-hum, voice recognition--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: This interaction, you know.
Speaker 2: So the genesis of all these are in digital field testing things that I had worked on, are used in the--
Speaker 1: There's even a little noise in the background--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: So we talked about this intelligent network that I talked about in the book was to do with advanced 800-number services.  You see, normally, if you--you can make a call, and you don't pay for it, but the other folks do pay for it, the advanced net services.  And that's how you, the first generation of intelligent networks.
Story_ID: 28221
Speaker 1: There's another book that you and [Syed] Ahamed published called--I guess it's a book too, called 'The Art of Scientific Innovation' [The art of scientific innovation: cases of classic creativity].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: We looked at various innovations that have occurred in the past whether in fiber optics, whether it goes back to Maxwell.  It goes back to Towns.  It goes back to--and then we talked about how do you really do scientific innovations and how do you do that?  It's a guide for professors and for students that are trying to get into doing scientific innovation.  So we published and we showed examples of things that had come in the past and how they did it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now, something--there's a statement that's in the book, I guess it's quoted here that I have, it's kind of intriguing.  It says "Computer-aided creativity, though not an impossibility, is a contradiction in terms."  (laughter)
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: "Computer-aided creativity" (laughter)
Speaker 2: Creativity, yeah.
Story_ID: 28222
Speaker 1: Now, you got the IEEE [The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers] Millennium Medal in 2000--well, the Emmy Award in '97 [1997]--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: That's for the HDTV [high-definition television].
Speaker 2: Yes, that was for HD-TV.
Speaker 1: And, now, what is the Grand Alliance Standard?  Is that the term for the standard that you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, for the standard.  So what you see in everybody's TV is the standard that we have.
Speaker 1: And that was developed in '97 [1997]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's in everybody's TV.
Speaker 1: And it hasn't changed since '97 [1997].
Speaker 2: It hasn't changed.  The standard hasn't changed.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, this is the standard for--
Speaker 2: Standards, once you have it, it's difficult to change because then you have to go back and retrofit every (laughter), every set or, or whatever you can do, but it has to be compatible, whatever, the new things have to be, fall back to be compatible to the old ones.  They are difficult.  So once you have a (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And this, to be clear, this is--for the HDTV, this is how the signal's processed or--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, how the signals are received and how they are processed.  So, you say how do you process a signal to transmit it, how the signal is received and how it's processed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they have done it in the high definition form so that it's very, very good quality image.
Speaker 1: Now, I remember reading in the paper, 'Chicago Tribune' [newspaper, Chicago, Illinois] back, way back when, about the Japanese developing HD television and mass producing them way before the U.S.--
Speaker 2: But it was not chosen as a standard.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The Japanese one, they died. They were ahead, but they did not end up as the standard.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what they were working with then was not as good as what we have today?
Speaker 2: No, what we have today.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay, and in 2000, you won the IEEE Millennium Medal--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: That's, now, this is--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: They looked at (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Now, what was that for?
Speaker 2: They looked back at the people that have contributed significantly in innovations, as well as for IEEE and they gave us medals.
Story_ID: 28223
Speaker 1: Okay, the year 2000 is significant because of Y2K, all these--
Speaker 2: Yes, all those things--
Speaker 1: --predictions that the planes would fall out of the sky and--
Speaker 2: That's right, and they never did.
Speaker 1: And none of this.  What did you think about that at that time, and what was all the fear about?
Speaker 2: Well, the fear about was that, you know, computers had not been stable.  You remember things like Microsoft and, you remember the PC [personal computer] and it breaks down and the software is not reliable.  So people were worried.  People were worried that this could happen, but the transition went very smoothly, transition went very smoothly.
Speaker 1: Did you think at the time that there was gonna be crises?
Speaker 2: No, no, I did not think that there would be.  I was sure that they would--especially, for the scientific, for the defense ones, I was sure that they would go manual if they had to.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Well, okay.
Speaker 2: It would be tedious, but I was sure they would go manual.
Speaker 1: It seems like there was not a, I guess the right kind of communication between the scientific community and municipalities that spent millions of dollars trying to protect themselves from some kind of--
Speaker 2: Sure, yeah.
Speaker 1: --Y2K crash?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.  And the, and the people, the IRS [Internal Revenue Service], the--everybody was worried.
Speaker 1: Do you think that all the money that they spent trying to avoid disaster was somehow milked out of them by crooked people or what do you--what happened?
Speaker 2: No, I think that it was genuinely spent, but it was--in everything that you do, and I have a--now that you asked at first, whatever you invent can never be uninvented.  You must find the best ways of using it.  And therefore, whatever we spent in Y2K was really useful in many ways.  It has led to many different innovations that we are taking advantage of.  Societies like India have taken advantage of this completely because most of the Y2K things were being done in India, translations, and now it's become a powerhouse for ICT [Information and Communications Technology].
Speaker 1: Okay, so it did have like a positive effect--
Speaker 2: It had a positive effect.
Speaker 1: And it, so you're saying it focused people on problems that they would not have focused on otherwise?
Speaker 2: Focused on, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 28224
Speaker 1: Now, did you finish your career as a vice president of Bell Labs [New Jersey] or did you basically--
Speaker 2: Yes, I finished my career, retired from Bell Labs and then I joined the academic life.
Speaker 1: When you--
Speaker 2: In between, I guess there are two other medals that came.  One was the International Communications Medal.  I think I had alluded to you about making sure, and that even has its genesis in going to things that I'm doing now that I can describe that to you when we get to this.  So I finished my career very nicely after thirty-two years.
Speaker 1: Thirty-two years?
Speaker 2: Yes, in AT&T, '74 [1974] to 2006.
Story_ID: 28225
Speaker 1: Okay, now, how were you affected by the break-up of Bell and AT&T in--that was like 2000, I mean 1990?
Speaker 2: 1984 was the first one when they broke it down into AT&T and the eight regional Bell operating companies.  Yes, I was one of the people, in fact, in my lab, the judge came to my lab to have a look at my lab.  And the judge's decision, if AT&T had fought it, would have been that they, to not have been broken up.  But AT&T did not fight it properly.  So AT&T was broken up into eight pieces, and now the eight pieces have come together again into about only three pieces left.  AT&T, Verizon, and I think one more.  But, yes, it affected us in the sense that we did not have the customer to channel our research results to, the Bell operating companies easily.  We had competition from all over.  We had competition from the Japanese.  We had competition from Ericsson, (unclear) Siemens, and then again, in 1996, break up was more of a difficult one when AT&T broke itself up into three voluntarily, the computer part, which was NCR, that it had bought before.  And then it, AT&T sell (unclear) the service and then the equipment which was Lucent.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that was a painful break.
Speaker 1: And when did Bell Labs as a, as a generator of ideas and this per--this great place to work start deteriorating?
Speaker 2: Yes, when we got into Lucent.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So Lucent--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And then Lucent started not doing very well, so then the problems started.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We're talking about the beginning of the 2000, 2002 thereabouts.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 28226
Speaker 1: All right, so when you look back at your career at Bell Labs [New Jersey], what would you consider to be the milestones or your, you know, legacy at Bell Labs?
Speaker 2: Two ways, we can talk about the scientific part.  That means looking at various innovations in products and services that we have brought out.  You can look at those things and talk about my work in digital signal processing, my work in data communications, my work in, helping creating new companies for AT&T.  You know, I did create many companies for AT&T.  We spun off a number of companies.  So it became like an entrepreneur in many ways, Globespan Semiconductors, I helped AT&T spin it off.  It was technology from my lab.  Elemedia, the Internet software, Lucent Digital Video, the video, Lucent Digital Radio.  So these are all creations that had come through me or colleagues of mine.  And then the Sirius radio, satellite Sirius radio.  We did all the systems engineering in the--both the transmitter and the receiver today for Sirius radio.  Those are within it, so we did those things as well.  And then comes my two other things that I've been working on, the submarine communications.  I have been working on the submarine system for Africa for some time now.  And that's one of the things I'm still continuing to work to make sure that Africa can get the Internet.  Africa can be able to access the rest of the world and the rest of the world be able to access Africa easily with the submarine cable.  That's what I'm working on now, and Barharicom [Development Company (BDC)], submarine cable.
Speaker 1: There's a story, I know I heard a story from another scientist about the Sirius satellite network.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And it's, it being related to a scientist from Africa came up with the idea for the satellite coverage, I mean a global satellite network that was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: This Ethiopian guy (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --I wish I could remember all the details of this.
Speaker 2: It's the Ethiopian guy.  And he tried to do it for radio, yeah.  He tried to do something for radio, yes.
Speaker 1: Who was it, again?
Speaker 2: What, his name, I've forgotten, but he's an Ethiopian.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: From Ethiopia.  The name will come back to me.  But if you really ask, I've told you there's been scientific, tremendous amount of scientific innovations that I have shepherded and brought to practice.  But if you were to ask me, personally, I think what I would like to be remembered with is my loyalty to my colleagues and my loyalty to the institution.  Those two are very important and dear to me.  Yes, I was very loyal to all my colleagues, helped in many ways I could, helped them develop, their helping me to develop.  So that loyalty and that bond was there, so my loyalty to my colleagues and the loyalty to the institution of Bell Labs that one stayed with, I've tremendous amount of loyalty to those two.
Story_ID: 28227
Speaker 1: Now, what I did learn from there [Bell Labs, New Jersey] to where I am now, becoming a professor, a chaired professor as well as associate dean for special programs [Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, New Jersey]--
Speaker 2: Now, you started here at Stevens--
Speaker 1: 2006.
Speaker 2: 2006, okay.
Speaker 1: When I left AT&T [Bell Labs, New Jersey].  What I have learned here, I've set up a center, call center for intelligent networks and the Center for Intelligent Networks, you ask what is it?  It's that when I came here, I met a gentleman by the name of Frank Fernandez, and he used to be former head of DARPA [Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency].  But he is the one that said, he said, Victor, we don't know how to wage urban warfare.  Can you develop techniques that could help us with urban warfare because we are having tremendous problems in Iraq and so forth.  So I started, and then I started looking at this and said, what can we do?  And then he came back and he said, look, let's make it broader and call it 'Urban Operations' because we are gonna have [Hurricane] Katrina [2005], we are going to have this and we must be able to have technologies that can help us in all these disasters.  And that's when I coined the word "Intelligent Networks," where the network is so intelligent, where the end points to the network are intelligent and how can you work in these areas.  So, for instance, is intelligent networks, is eventually when Katarina came, we were not able to--the various organizations like the city of Hoboken was not able to talk to Interpol easily.  They were on different frequencies.  So we had to find ways of making the networks compatible, translating from one network to the other, making it intelligent.  That is going, knows that it's going to talk to this network, and within the network itself, make it so intelligent that it could do many things.  The end points, whether you are using a camera to do surveillance or the, the end points are all very intelligent.  And they could then communicate with an intelligent network.  So that was a trust, and then make the network so intelligent that it could help avoid cyber attacks, harden it.  So these are the thrusts of research things that I'm working on here.  At the same time, I have the flexibility to help Africa, and as such, I'm the chairman of Barharicom Development Company that the African Union set up, the African Union set up a company to try to be able to see how we could bring communications to Africa within Africa, and outside Africa, to the outside world, make it cheap for people, put a lot of applications on, for e-Health, e-Education and other things.  And that's what another thrust that I'm working on, this submarine cable that would circle Africa and make sure that Africa can have communications within it, and therefore, help develop the continent of Africa in many ways.
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: So that's another thrust [ph.] of my passion and my work.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 28228
Speaker 1: Okay, so, yeah, so how was this working out?  How do the submarine cables work in terms of the project, the African communications problem you're trying to work on?
Speaker 2: I started, we started this work when we were with AT&T, with Bell Labs.  That was when we did a lot of the technologies that would allow submarine communications, put a fiber optics cable under the sea, under the ocean, under the ocean.  And this had been done very successfully in communications between U.S. and Europe, U.S. and Japan.  They've had these Atlantic cables, but they never had any for Africa, you see.  And so my passion was to make sure that this can be extended to Africa and how can we do it?  Many ways, the technologies are very simple technology--not very simple, but in many ways, you have a fiber which is the thickness of your hair.  And you have many of these bundled together, and so you put different colors of light on it, and you pulse each color of light.  For instance, today what is being done is we have about four--120 colors of light, different colors, blue, yellow, different shades, different colors of light.  And then we put, pulse it about 40 gigabytes per second, we--on and off for 40 gigabytes per second, for 40 times 10 to the nine times, you're putting the light on or off and within one second.  And so those are the type of things, you combine all these.  And then you get a terabyte, about 5 times 10 to the 15 terabytes.  And so there's a cable that is running along the coast of Africa.  There have been a couple of cable that we have seen installed with commercially, as well as the African union cable that we're talking about.  And it is stopping in every country, countries that have never had any cable in their life.  And those have been the countries that have had the greatest problems, Liberia, Sierra Leone and these countries.  And so we have brought communications to them so they can now access this cable and the cable to the rest of the world.  And the rest of the world coming in on this cable to Africa.  And they could easily communicate between themselves because they are all on the ring along the West Coast of Africa.  So that is something that I feel very passionate about.  And when we bring it there, cable, we are talking about applications of e-Education.  We have partnered with a New Jersey Center for Learning and send them to Gambia and other places of Africa where they are teaching a new way of teaching science and math and education.  And that is teaching teachers so the teachers can teach the students.  We don't have enough teachers in Africa for science and math.  And this is a way to help improve the situation.  The same thing about e-Health.  We don't have enough doctors.  So what can you do in e-Health to help?  And we are doing this in various countries, the African Union together with my initiatives in Rwanda, many, many, many other African countries.
Speaker 1: Okay, now who pays for all this, you know?
Speaker 2: Some of them, for instance, the Gambia project was paid for by the World Bank.  Some of the cables that I've talked about, some of it, the World Bank gave and some of it, multi--different multi-lateral companies are paying for it and the countries themselves are also paying for it.  But when you bring them all together under the ACE umbrella, Africa Coast to Europe umbrella, it becomes easier--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to build a cable.
Story_ID: 28229
Speaker 1: What other projects are you working on here at Stevens [Institute of Technology, Hoboken, New Jersey] as dean?
Speaker 2: Apart from the Intelligent Network that I'm working on, okay.  In the Intelligent Network, there are a couple of projects, a number of them.  But the one that is, I'm working on now, is for the small arms.  And it's a way to use a camera, we can use both infrared camera or electro-optic, and you have all this in one--you have two different filters and two different cameras.  So you take a picture, and then at the same time, you've taken the infrared part of the picture, you fuse this together, and therefore, it becomes a better image.  And then you detect, and then you track, you detect an object, and then you can track the object.  So that's what I'm working on now with some of the teams of professors here on this project.  It's part of the Intelligent Network.  So what are we doing?  Yes, the intelligence this time is at the end-point, of the camera,  intelligent camera, looking at both electro-optic or infrared, fusing them together.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And you understand the--when you use infrared, you can see things that electro-optic cannot see and vice versa.  So when you fuse the two, you get a better image.  So that's what I'm working on at this time now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you occasionally teach at the United States War College--
Speaker 2: Yes, that was some time ago, yes.  Yes, I did teach them communications.  They bring in generals, colonels and so forth, and we need to teach them the new technologies and new communications things that I have.  So I was teaching them new communications--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: So was that right after, I know in 2001 after 9/11, I think a lot of people were shocked to find out that the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] didn't communicate with the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and that was part of this Intelligent Network that I do have.  And this Intelligent Network that I'm talking to you about, being able to have them communicate, I can--we, I even, it's more ambitious.  I can even have the network translate for you.  So if there's somebody in Israel, speaking to somebody in the Arab world, they can communicate, and I can translate from Arabic to Hebrew, or, I'm looking at things like that.  I can have--the network is intelligent that it can do translation for you, you know.  You don't need a human being to sit down.  We can be able to translate it for you, all by signal processing and speech recognition and these techniques.  Those will be there ultimate.  That's where we want to get to.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, where do you see--well, this is what you're trying--a real intelligent network is your--
Speaker 2: Um-hum--
Speaker 1: --your aim, right--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, it's my aim.  Yes, it's my aim, real intelligent network.
Speaker 1: --to make something that you described before that can actually anticipate problems and questions--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --and suggests how to make things better--
Speaker 2: Better.
Speaker 1: --as you, you know.
Speaker 2: Um-hum, and no barrier in language.  You say it and the network will translate it for you.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 28230
Speaker 1: So, you know, the science fiction movies always have an age where--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --the human beings are no longer needed (laughter) 'cause the world's gonna run by--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --you know, intelligent computers.
Speaker 2: Yes--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Do you--where do you see the future of the human being in all this stuff?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) And what would the human being do?  Well, you know, we are talking about the age of leisure.  My professor is now, my professor who has passed away, Colin Cherry, became a philosopher, you know, as he grows older, he became a philosopher.  And then he was talking to us about the age of leisure and went on and on and on.  I haven't seen it yet, and look, in Bell Labs, in 1984 to '86 [1986], embarked on some ambitious projects, where they said that you don't need factory workers.  We have robots, robots will do everything for you or each human being will have a robot.  And so the robot will be doing the heavy, lifting and things, and the human being will just sit down and program things.  Or even this programming can be done automatically through a, at a central command.  We also said, you don't need software developers.  We're just going to speak English into a compiler, and it will translate for you.  We had these ambitious projects.  It has not quite worked out, but eventually, one day, I will just say a few things in English, and then the computer will come up with a code and the software code to do it.
Speaker 1: Okay--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: One day we will get there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would hope that human beings would take the leisure time to make a better world.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Or think of ways to improve our knowledge about--
Speaker 2: Um-hum, yes.
Speaker 1: --everything.
Speaker 2: That's right, the age of leisure, and you don't have to work ninety hours (laughter).
Story_ID: 28231
Speaker 1: Now, you're from Ghana, and you're here in the--you've been here in the [United] States for a long time.  What are some of your hopes and concerns, I guess about the African American community and the African community today?
Speaker 2: The hopes?
Speaker 1: Yeah, hopes and concerns, and concerns.
Speaker 2: Um-hum, I have a tremendous amount of hope, and that hope ties into the United States.  You know, the United States is powerful because you have everybody here.  If I--that's what I used to tell people--if I am competing with the Japanese, and I--the U.S. is competing with Japanese, I will find and say in Africa, I will find a black American who will represent United States better than the Japanese guy representing.  This is the strength of United States, the United States, and the United States, of all people.  So if I want to go and do some business in Japan, I'm going to take a Japanese American and let the Japanese American go and do it.  They are better.  He knows the culture, they know the people.  They can estimate, they are same as them.  Africa is an emerging country now, the continent now, tremendous opportunity.  Africa has tremendous amount of wealth, whether you're talking in terms of gold, you're talking in terms of energy, you're talking in terms of agriculture, whatever you can think about, whether in terms of energy, solar energy.  So it is emerging world now.  If only Africa can get its act together, you would find that the bridge between the black Americans and the Africans would be something that can be used and, in fact, when Pat Moore and others were thinking about this, they were thinking that black Americans could go to Africa and help Africa.  So that's, so I have tremendous amount of hope and faith that this bond will come about and what the black Americans have learned in the U.S., they can part it onto the Africans and whatever wealth the Africans have, can be brought to the black Americans and to Americans in general.
Speaker 1: Intelligent Communications Network seem to be playing a major role in political activity world wide--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --on the Arab Spring and other--
Speaker 2: Yes, it has, it has, indeed.
Speaker 1: So, do you see the same thing happening in Africa?
Speaker 2: I see the same thing happening in Africa.  I see the same thing happening in Africa.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think slowly, one after the other, they will be having a good governance, good elections, good democracy.
Story_ID: 28232
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back at everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could go back and change something?
Speaker 2: These are things that I have to think about, but could I do things differently at certain times?  Yes, I am sure.  I am sure because there's always room for improvement.  There's always room for improving after failures, and there are many things I've worked on that perhaps haven't been successful.  So, there is tremendous room for improvement.  And I think I can do certain things much better in life.
Speaker 1: Okay, what are you--do you have any ideas about the prospects of your native land of Ghana?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.  I do have tremendous thing about Ghana.  Ghana has recently discovered oil and gas, in addition to its cocoa and gold and bauxite and diamonds.  So it's a very wealthy, rich country, rich in mineral resources, rich in energy now, and rich in its people, itself.  Believe me, one of the things that [Kwame] Nkrumah [first president of Ghana] and others did was a good training and a good education.  And so it has that instincts.  And it didn't surprise me that Ghana is now a country that has had democratic elections, one after the other.  And it's been very, very successful.  It's a beacon of Africa.  It's--President Obama [President Barack Obama] just did not choose any other country--he chose Ghana to be the first place he wanted to visit.  So I think there is tremendous amount of hope there.  There's a lot of work to be done.  They have shortage of electricity.  They have shortage of water.  There are many things still to be done.  Health wise, they have to improve, but I'm sure, I'm sure they will get there, sure they will get there.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: Well, tell us something about your family.  You say you got--you were married--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And do you have children?
Speaker 2: I have two children, yes.  My children are young.  One of them is in the, your State of Illinois.  She's in Northwestern [University] in Evanston, and she wants to do economics and international development, remarkable young lady.  When she was very young, I took them to South Africa, very young, when she was in high school.  We visited Robben Island where President [Nelson] Mandela was imprisoned, and the conditions, and we visited so many places.  And she ended up adopting one of the homes for girls in there, and she kept working with them, and she kept sending them things and so forth.  That's (unclear) where--place of hope.  So she kept on.  So she has adopted an attitude of helping the needy.  She also works with an organization here called (unclear) that distributes school--shoes to minorities and underprivileged places in the United States and worldwide.  She's still working on this, as she's still going to school.  So she has that passion to help, and she's doing it very, very well.  The other one is much younger, and he's in seventh grade, and he's also working hard at it, at what he could do to help change the world.  So they are both doing fairly well, and I think they will grow up to be people that would work hard to see the improvement of society.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what does your wife do for a living?
Speaker 2: My wife used to be--she's, she used to be an interpreter in French, and she then had a traveling agency, and she has also stopped work now.  So she's, she's home now, yeah.

Speaker 1: I've been very much supporting this teaching of STEM [science, technology, engineering and mathematics] education, both in the United States and overseas, teaching science, math, technology.  So I think I have touched on that.  That has also been one of my passionate things.  I, myself, am the co-founder and president of a charitable organization called 'ICEC', International Cultural Exchange Center.  And there we have been thinking about using culture to bridge differences, to stop the wars and to stop things that are not really good, to bring humanity, people together.  So I have the International Cultural Exchange Center.  I started that at Bell Labs when we felt that we could get India and Pakistan together, Ireland and Britain together, Irish and the British together, Israel and the Arabs, Rwanda, where we have the Tutsis [and the Hutus; ethnic tribes] in the, together.  So that's what we believe culture exchange, can really help people understand each other, understanding, so that we could--so I have that in the background of things that I do.  It's a non-charitable--it's a charitable organization.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Nonprofit organization.  Okay.

Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered more on the humanitarian side than, maybe even on my technical achievements.  And that was why I sort of told you that I hope people will remember me as somebody who is loyal to his colleagues, loyal to his institution.  Therefore, you can expand that to somebody who really wants to help humanity across the board, more so than my inventions in HDTV [high definition TV] and inventions in wireless and so forth.  I think I like to look at technology for humanity.  Was I able to help so many Africans?  Was I able to help so many people in United States in challenged areas?  These are the type of things that eventually, one day, I would like to.  So that's how I see it in many ways.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
